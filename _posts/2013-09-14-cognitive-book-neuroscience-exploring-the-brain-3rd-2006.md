**4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Undergrad Text October 12, 2008**

By Douglas Long

Format:Hardcover|Verified Purchase

Overall this is an excellent text for an undergraduate level course. It is the 3rd book on the subject that I've read and the best of the lot. It is much more conprehensive than the others, but does not get into the details of some graduate level books.

The content deserves a 5 star, but I gave it 4 stars overall because of a couple shortcomings. The graphics don't convey the 3 dimensionality of the anatomy. All of my anatomy texts do a far better job representing internal structures, and this becomes extremely important.

2nd, there are some areas overemphasized, some omissions, and a problem with the order of presentation. The chapter on attention tells me that one of the authors researches in this area. Sorry, it doesn't warrant a chapter. You know you're on the wrong track when you spend an entire page just explaining the minutiae of a single experiment. Second, there was no mention of intelligence. Yes it's a hotbutton issue. No excuse for ignoring it. Finally, issues were raised, such as fear or emotions, that use the same structure. It would be helpful to discuss the anatomy in more detail early on instead of introducing structures piecemeal.

Overall an excellent book.

<h1>109 emnlp-2012-Re-training Monolingual Parser Bilingually for Syntactic SMT</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2012-109-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D12/D12-1078.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Shujie Liu ; Chi-Ho Li ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: The training of most syntactic SMT approaches involves two essential components, word alignment and monolingual parser. In the current state of the art these two components are mutually independent, thus causing problems like lack of rule generalization, and violation of syntactic correspondence in translation rules. In this paper, we propose two ways of re-training monolingual parser with the target of maximizing the consistency between parse trees and alignment matrices. One is targeted self-training with a simple evaluation function; the other is based on training data selection from forced alignment of bilingual data. We also propose an auxiliary method for boosting alignment quality, by symmetrizing alignment matrices with respect to parse trees. The best combination of these novel methods achieves 3 Bleu point gain in an IWSLT task and more than 1 Bleu point gain in NIST tasks. 1</p><br/>

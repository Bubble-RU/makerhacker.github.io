<h1>118 emnlp-2012-Source Language Adaptation for Resource-Poor Machine Translation</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2012-118-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D12/D12-1027.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Pidong Wang ; Preslav Nakov ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel, language-independent approach for improving machine translation from a resource-poor language to X by adapting a large bi-text for a related resource-rich language and X (the same target language). We assume a small bi-text for the resourcepoor language to X pair, which we use to learn word-level and phrase-level paraphrases and cross-lingual morphological variants between the resource-rich and the resource-poor language; we then adapt the former to get closer to the latter. Our experiments for Indonesian/Malay–English translation show that using the large adapted resource-rich bitext yields 6.7 BLEU points of improvement over the unadapted one and 2.6 BLEU points over the original small bi-text. Moreover, combining the small bi-text with the adapted bi-text outperforms the corresponding combinations with the unadapted bi-text by 1.5– 3 BLEU points. We also demonstrate applicability to other languages and domains.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2012-31-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D12/D12-1070.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ping Xu ; Pascale Fung</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes cross-lingual language modeling for transcribing source resourcepoor languages and translating them into target resource-rich languages if necessary. Our focus is to improve the speech recognition performance of low-resource languages by leveraging the language model statistics from resource-rich languages. The most challenging work of cross-lingual language modeling is to solve the syntactic discrepancies between the source and target languages. We therefore propose syntactic reordering for cross-lingual language modeling, and present a first result that compares inversion transduction grammar (ITG) reordering constraints to IBM and local constraints in an integrated speech transcription and translation system. Evaluations on resource-poor Cantonese speech transcription and Cantonese to resource-rich Mandarin translation tasks show that our proposed approach improves the system performance significantly, up to 3.4% relative WER reduction in Cantonese transcription and 13.3% relative bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score improvement in Mandarin transcription compared with the system without reordering.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2012-92-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D12/D12-1119.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Mahesh Joshi ; Mark Dredze ; William W. Cohen ; Carolyn Rose</p><p>Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of existing multi-domain learning approaches with respect to two questions. First, many multidomain learning algorithms resemble ensemble learning algorithms. (1) Are multi-domain learning improvements the result of ensemble learning effects? Second, these algorithms are traditionally evaluated in a balanced class label setting, although in practice many multidomain settings have domain-specific class label biases. When multi-domain learning is applied to these settings, (2) are multidomain methods improving because they capture domain-specific class biases? An understanding of these two issues presents a clearer idea about where the field has had success in multi-domain learning, and it suggests some important open questions for improving beyond the current state of the art.</p><br/>

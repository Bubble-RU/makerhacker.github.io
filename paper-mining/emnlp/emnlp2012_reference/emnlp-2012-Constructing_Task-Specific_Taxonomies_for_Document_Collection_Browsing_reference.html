<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2012-30-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D12/D12-1117.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Hui Yang</p><p>Abstract: Taxonomies can serve as browsing tools for document collections. However, given an arbitrary collection, pre-constructed taxonomies could not easily adapt to the specific topic/task present in the collection. This paper explores techniques to quickly derive task-specific taxonomies supporting browsing in arbitrary document collections. The supervised approach directly learns semantic distances from users to propose meaningful task-specific taxonomies. The approach aims to produce globally optimized taxonomy structures by incorporating path consistency control and usergenerated task specification into the general learning framework. A comparison to stateof-the-art systems and a user study jointly demonstrate that our techniques are highly effective. .</p><br/>

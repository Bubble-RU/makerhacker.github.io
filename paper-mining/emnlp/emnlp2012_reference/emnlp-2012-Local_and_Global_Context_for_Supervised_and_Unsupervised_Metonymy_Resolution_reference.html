<h1>85 emnlp-2012-Local and Global Context for Supervised and Unsupervised Metonymy Resolution</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2012-85-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D12/D12-1017.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Vivi Nastase ; Alex Judea ; Katja Markert ; Michael Strube</p><p>Abstract: Computational approaches to metonymy resolution have focused almost exclusively on the local context, especially the constraints placed on a potentially metonymic word by its grammatical collocates. We expand such approaches by taking into account the larger context. Our algorithm is tested on the data from the metonymy resolution task (Task 8) at SemEval 2007. The results show that incorporation of the global context can improve over the use of the local context alone, depending on the types of metonymies addressed. As a second contribution, we move towards unsupervised resolution of metonymies, made feasible by considering ontological relations as possible readings. We show that such an unsupervised approach delivers promising results: it beats the supervised most frequent sense baseline and performs close to a supervised approach using only standard lexico-syntactic features.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2012-84-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D12/D12-1011.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Avirup Sil ; Ernest Cronin ; Penghai Nie ; Yinfei Yang ; Ana-Maria Popescu ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Existing techniques for disambiguating named entities in text mostly focus on Wikipedia as a target catalog of entities. Yet for many types of entities, such as restaurants and cult movies, relational databases exist that contain far more extensive information than Wikipedia. This paper introduces a new task, called Open-Database Named-Entity Disambiguation (Open-DB NED), in which a system must be able to resolve named entities to symbols in an arbitrary database, without requiring labeled data for each new database. We introduce two techniques for Open-DB NED, one based on distant supervision and the other based on domain adaptation. In experiments on two domains, one with poor coverage by Wikipedia and the other with near-perfect coverage, our Open-DB NED strategies outperform a state-of-the-art Wikipedia NED system by over 25% in accuracy.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2012-91-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D12/D12-1101.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Sameer Singh ; Michael Wick ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Conditional random fields and other graphical models have achieved state of the art results in a variety of tasks such as coreference, relation extraction, data integration, and parsing. Increasingly, practitioners are using models with more complex structure—higher treewidth, larger fan-out, more features, and more data—rendering even approximate inference methods such as MCMC inefficient. In this paper we propose an alternative MCMC sam- pling scheme in which transition probabilities are approximated by sampling from the set of relevant factors. We demonstrate that our method converges more quickly than a traditional MCMC sampler for both marginal and MAP inference. In an author coreference task with over 5 million mentions, we achieve a 13 times speedup over regular MCMC inference.</p><br/>

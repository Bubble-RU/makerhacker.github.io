<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2012-73-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D12/D12-1114.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Yang Song ; Jing Jiang ; Wayne Xin Zhao ; Sujian Li ; Houfeng Wang</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise coreference resolution models must merge pairwise coreference decisions to generate final outputs. Traditional merging methods adopt different strategies such as the bestfirst method and enforcing the transitivity constraint, but most of these methods are used independently of the pairwise learning methods as an isolated inference procedure at the end. We propose a joint learning model which combines pairwise classification and mention clustering with Markov logic. Experimental results show that our joint learning system outperforms independent learning systems. Our system gives a better performance than all the learning-based systems from the CoNLL-201 1shared task on the same dataset. Compared with the best system from CoNLL2011, which employs a rule-based method, our system shows competitive performance.</p><br/>

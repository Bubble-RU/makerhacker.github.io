<h1>77 emnlp-2012-Learning Constraints for Consistent Timeline Extraction</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2012-77-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D12/D12-1080.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: David McClosky ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We present a distantly supervised system for extracting the temporal bounds of fluents (relations which only hold during certain times, such as attends school). Unlike previous pipelined approaches, our model does not assume independence between each fluent or even between named entities with known connections (parent, spouse, employer, etc.). Instead, we model what makes timelines of fluents consistent by learning cross-fluent constraints, potentially spanning entities as well. For example, our model learns that someone is unlikely to start a job at age two or to marry someone who hasn’t been born yet. Our system achieves a 36% error reduction over a pipelined baseline.</p><br/>

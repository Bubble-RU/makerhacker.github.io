<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2012-113-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D12/D12-1115.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Varada Kolhatkar ; Graeme Hirst</p><p>Abstract: We annotate and resolve a particular case of abstract anaphora, namely, thisissue anaphora. We propose a candidate ranking model for this-issue anaphora resolution that explores different issuespecific and general abstract-anaphora features. The model is not restricted to nominal or verbal antecedents; rather, it is able to identify antecedents that are arbitrary spans of text. Our results show that (a) the model outperforms the strong adjacent-sentence baseline; (b) general abstract-anaphora features, as distinguished from issue-specific features, play a crucial role in this-issue anaphora resolution, suggesting that our approach can be generalized for other NPs such as this problem and this debate; and (c) it is possible to reduce the search space in order to improve performance.</p><br/>

<p>Author: Lan Du ; Wray Buntine ; Huidong Jin</p><p>Abstract: Topic models are increasingly being used for text analysis tasks, often times replacing earlier semantic techniques such as latent semantic analysis. In this paper, we develop a novel adaptive topic model with the ability to adapt topics from both the previous segment and the parent document. For this proposed model, a Gibbs sampler is developed for doing posterior inference. Experimental results show that with topic adaptation, our model significantly improves over existing approaches in terms of perplexity, and is able to uncover clear sequential structure on, for example, Herman Melville’s book “Moby Dick”.</p><p>3 0.15592015 <a title="89-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Biased_Representation_Learning_for_Domain_Adaptation.html">24 emnlp-2012-Biased Representation Learning for Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Huang ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Representation learning is a promising technique for discovering features that allow supervised classifiers to generalize from a source domain dataset to arbitrary new domains. We present a novel, formal statement of the representation learning task. We argue that because the task is computationally intractable in general, it is important for a representation learner to be able to incorporate expert knowledge during its search for helpful features. Leveraging the Posterior Regularization framework, we develop an architecture for incorporating biases into representation learning. We investigate three types of biases, and experiments on two domain adaptation tasks show that our biased learners identify significantly better sets of features than unbiased learners, resulting in a relative reduction in error of more than 16% for both tasks, with respect to existing state-of-the-art representation learning techniques.</p><p>4 0.12477218 <a title="89-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Discovering_Diverse_and_Salient_Threads_in_Document_Collections.html">33 emnlp-2012-Discovering Diverse and Salient Threads in Document Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Gillenwater ; Alex Kulesza ; Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic technique for modeling and extracting salient structure from large document collections. As in clustering and topic modeling, our goal is to provide an organizing perspective into otherwise overwhelming amounts of information. We are particularly interested in revealing and exploiting relationships between documents. To this end, we focus on extracting diverse sets of threads—singlylinked, coherent chains of important documents. To illustrate, we extract research threads from citation graphs and construct timelines from news articles. Our method is highly scalable, running on a corpus of over 30 million words in about four minutes, more than 75 times faster than a dynamic topic model. Finally, the results from our model more closely resemble human news summaries according to several metrics and are also preferred by human judges.</p><p>5 0.10908569 <a title="89-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Type-Supervised_Hidden_Markov_Models_for_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_with_Incomplete_Tag_Dictionaries.html">129 emnlp-2012-Type-Supervised Hidden Markov Models for Part-of-Speech Tagging with Incomplete Tag Dictionaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Garrette ; Jason Baldridge</p><p>Abstract: Past work on learning part-of-speech taggers from tag dictionaries and raw data has reported good results, but the assumptions made about those dictionaries are often unrealistic: due to historical precedents, they assume access to information about labels in the raw and test sets. Here, we demonstrate ways to learn hidden Markov model taggers from incomplete tag dictionaries. Taking the MINGREEDY algorithm (Ravi et al., 2010) as a starting point, we improve it with several intuitive heuristics. We also define a simple HMM emission initialization that takes advantage of the tag dictionary and raw data to capture both the openness of a given tag and its estimated prevalence in the raw data. Altogether, our augmentations produce improvements to per- formance over the original MIN-GREEDY algorithm for both English and Italian data.</p><p>6 0.10793953 <a title="89-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Revisiting_the_Predictability_of_Language%3A_Response_Completion_in_Social_Media.html">114 emnlp-2012-Revisiting the Predictability of Language: Response Completion in Social Media</a></p>

<p>Author: Robert Lindsey ; William Headden ; Michael Stipicevic</p><p>Abstract: Topic models traditionally rely on the bagof-words assumption. In data mining applications, this often results in end-users being presented with inscrutable lists of topical unigrams, single words inferred as representative of their topics. In this article, we present a hierarchical generative probabilistic model of topical phrases. The model simultaneously infers the location, length, and topic of phrases within a corpus and relaxes the bagof-words assumption within phrases by using a hierarchy of Pitman-Yor processes. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for approximate inference in the model and perform slice sampling to learn its hyperparameters. We show via an experiment on human subjects that our model finds substantially better, more interpretable topical phrases than do competing models.</p><p>5 0.4971824 <a title="89-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-SSHLDA%3A_A_Semi-Supervised_Hierarchical_Topic_Model.html">115 emnlp-2012-SSHLDA: A Semi-Supervised Hierarchical Topic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Xian-Ling Mao ; Zhao-Yan Ming ; Tat-Seng Chua ; Si Li ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Supervised hierarchical topic modeling and unsupervised hierarchical topic modeling are usually used to obtain hierarchical topics, such as hLLDA and hLDA. Supervised hierarchical topic modeling makes heavy use of the information from observed hierarchical labels, but cannot explore new topics; while unsupervised hierarchical topic modeling is able to detect automatically new topics in the data space, but does not make use of any information from hierarchical labels. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised hierarchical topic model which aims to explore new topics automatically in the data space while incorporating the information from observed hierarchical labels into the modeling process, called SemiSupervised Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SSHLDA). We also prove that hLDA and hLLDA are special cases of SSHLDA. We . conduct experiments on Yahoo! Answers and ODP datasets, and assess the performance in terms of perplexity and clustering. The experimental results show that predictive ability of SSHLDA is better than that of baselines, and SSHLDA can also achieve significant improvement over baselines for clustering on the FScore measure.</p><p>6 0.47013465 <a title="89-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Exploring_Topic_Coherence_over_Many_Models_and_Many_Topics.html">49 emnlp-2012-Exploring Topic Coherence over Many Models and Many Topics</a></p>

<p>Author: Simon Carter ; Marc Dymetman ; Guillaume Bouchard</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for exact optimization and sampling from high order Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which are generally handled by approximation techniques. Motivated by adaptive rejection sampling and heuristic search, we propose a strategy based on sequentially refining a lower-order language model that is an upper bound on the true model we wish to decode and sample from. This allows us to build tractable variable-order HMMs. The ARPA format for language models is extended to enable an efficient use of the max-backoff quantities required to compute the upper bound. We evaluate our approach on two problems: a SMS-retrieval task and a POS tagging experiment using 5-gram models. Results show that the same approach can be used for exact optimization and sampling, while explicitly constructing only a fraction of the total implicit state-space.</p><p>2 0.99118268 <a title="89-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2012-Dynamic_Programming_for_Higher_Order_Parsing_of_Gap-Minding_Trees.html">37 emnlp-2012-Dynamic Programming for Higher Order Parsing of Gap-Minding Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Emily Pitler ; Sampath Kannan ; Mitchell Marcus</p><p>Abstract: We introduce gap inheritance, a new structural property on trees, which provides a way to quantify the degree to which intervals of descendants can be nested. Based on this property, two new classes of trees are derived that provide a closer approximation to the set of plausible natural language dependency trees than some alternative classes of trees: unlike projective trees, a word can have descendants in more than one interval; unlike spanning trees, these intervals cannot be nested in arbitrary ways. The 1-Inherit class of trees has exactly the same empirical coverage of natural language sentences as the class of mildly nonprojective trees, yet the optimal scoring tree can be found in an order of magnitude less time. Gap-minding trees (the second class) have the property that all edges into an interval of descendants come from the same node, and thus an algorithm which uses only single in- tervals can produce trees in which a node has descendants in multiple intervals.</p><p>3 0.98687035 <a title="89-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Parser_Showdown_at_the_Wall_Street_Corral%3A_An_Empirical_Investigation_of_Error_Types_in_Parser_Output.html">105 emnlp-2012-Parser Showdown at the Wall Street Corral: An Empirical Investigation of Error Types in Parser Output</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; David Hall ; James R. Curran ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Constituency parser performance is primarily interpreted through a single metric, F-score on WSJ section 23, that conveys no linguistic information regarding the remaining errors. We classify errors within a set of linguistically meaningful types using tree transformations that repair groups of errors together. We use this analysis to answer a range of questions about parser behaviour, including what linguistic constructions are difficult for stateof-the-art parsers, what types of errors are being resolved by rerankers, and what types are introduced when parsing out-of-domain text.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.95255566 <a title="89-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Mixed_Membership_Markov_Models_for_Unsupervised_Conversation_Modeling.html">89 emnlp-2012-Mixed Membership Markov Models for Unsupervised Conversation Modeling</a></p>

Additionally, we show quantitatively that the induced word clusters correspond to speech acts more closely than baseline models.</p><p>5 0.85322118 <a title="89-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Forest_Reranking_through_Subtree_Ranking.html">55 emnlp-2012-Forest Reranking through Subtree Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Farkas ; Helmut Schmid</p><p>Abstract: We propose the subtree ranking approach to parse forest reranking which is a generalization of current perceptron-based reranking methods. For the training of the reranker, we extract competing local subtrees, hence the training instances (candidate subtree sets) are very similar to those used during beamsearch parsing. This leads to better parameter optimization. Another chief advantage of the framework is that arbitrary learning to rank methods can be applied. We evaluated our reranking approach on German and English phrase structure parsing tasks and compared it to various state-of-the-art reranking approaches such as the perceptron-based forest reranker. The subtree ranking approach with a Maximum Entropy model significantly outperformed the other approaches.</p><p>6 0.85226017 <a title="89-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Improving_Transition-Based_Dependency_Parsing_with_Buffer_Transitions.html">66 emnlp-2012-Improving Transition-Based Dependency Parsing with Buffer Transitions</a></p>

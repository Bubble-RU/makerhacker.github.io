</p><p>4 ” The fact that the English demand takes nouns on its left and right indicates that the German verlangen should do the same, correctly suggesting attachments to Verzicht and Gewerkschaften. [sent-20, score-0.371]
</p><p>5 While these universal parsers currently constitute the highest-performing methods for languages without treebanks, they are inherently limited by operating at the coarse POS level, as lexical features are vital to supervised parsing models. [sent-24, score-0.392]
</p><p>6 In this work, we consider augmenting delexicalized parsers by transferring syntactic information through a bilingual lexicon at the word type level. [sent-25, score-0.598]
</p><p>7 These parsers are delexicalized in the sense that, although they receive target language words as input, their feature sets do not include indicators on those words. [sent-26, score-0.337]
</p><p>8 This setting is appropriate when there is too little target language data to learn lexical features di-  rectly. [sent-27, score-0.201]
</p><p>9 Our main approach is to add features which are lexical in the sense that they compute a function of specific target language words, but are still unPrLocane gduiang se L ofe athrnei 2n0g1,2 pa Jogienst 1 C–1o1n,fe Jre jnuce Is olan Ed,m Kpoir ieca ,l 1 M2–e1th4o Jdusly in 20 N1a2t.

</p><p>11 A delexicalized parser operating at the part of speech level does not have sufficient information to make the correct decision about, for example, the choice of subcategorization frame for the verb verlangen. [sent-32, score-0.209]
</p><p>12 We can fire features in our German parser on the attachments of Gewerkschaften and Verzicht to verlangen indicating that similar-looking attachments are attested in English for an English translation of verlangen. [sent-34, score-0.52]
</p><p>13 This allows us to exploit fine-grained lexical cues to  make German parsing decisions even when we have little or no supervised German data; moreover, this syntactic transfer is possible even in spite of the fact that demand and verlangen are not observed in parallel context. [sent-35, score-0.759]
</p><p>14 Using type-level transfer through a dictionary in this way allows us to decouple the lexico-syntactic projection from the data conditions under which we are learning the parser. [sent-36, score-0.484]
</p><p>15 After computing feature values using source language resources and a bilingual lexicon, our model can be trained very simply using any appropriate training method for a supervised parser. [sent-37, score-0.368]
</p><p>16 Furthermore, because the transfer mechanism is just a set of features over word types, we are free to derive our bilingual lexicon either from bitext or from a manually-constructed dictionary, making our method strictly more general than those of McDonald et al. [sent-38, score-0.828]
</p><p>17 This flexibility is potentially useful for resource-poor languages, where a humancurated bilingual lexicon may be broader in coverage or more robust to noise than a small, domainlimited bitext. [sent-41, score-0.393]
</p><p>18 Of course, it is an empirical question whether transferring type level information about  word behavior is effective; we show that, indeed, this method compares favorably with other transfer mechanisms used in past work. [sent-42, score-0.319]
</p><p>19 The actual syntactic information that we transfer consists of purely monolingual lexical attachment 2 statistics computed on an annotated source language resource. [sent-43, score-0.595]
</p><p>20 , 2011), doing so in a projection setting is novel and forces us to design features suitable for projection through a bilingual lexicon. [sent-46, score-0.454]
</p><p>21 Our features must also be flexible enough to provide benefit even in the presence of cross-lingual syntactic differences and noise introduced by the bilingual dictionary. [sent-47, score-0.328]
</p><p>22 Under two different training conditions and with two different varieties of bilingual lexicons, we show that our method of lexico-syntactic projection does indeed improve the performance of parsers that would otherwise be agnostic to lexical information. [sent-48, score-0.493]
</p><p>23 In all settings, we see statistically significant gains  for a range of languages, with our method providing up to 3% absolute improvement in unlabeled attachment score (UAS) and 11% relative error reduction. [sent-49, score-0.249]
</p><p>24 2  Model  The projected lexical features that we propose in this work are based on lexicalized versions of features found in MSTParser (McDonald et al. [sent-50, score-0.228]
</p><p>25 2 Byinstantiating the basic MSTParser features over coarse parts of speech, we construct a state-of-the-art delexicalized parser in the style of McDonald et al. [sent-53, score-0.269]
</p><p>26 (201 1), where feature weights can be directly transferred from a source language or languages to a desired target language. [sent-54, score-0.267]
</p><p>27 When we add projected lexical features on top of this baseline parser, we do so in a way that does not sacrifice this generality: while our new features take on values that are languagespecific, they interact with the model at a languageindependent level. [sent-55, score-0.228]
</p><p>28 We therefore have the best of  1Throughout  this work, we will use English as the source language, but it is possible to use any language for which the appropriate bilingual lexicons and treebanks exist. [sent-56, score-0.661]
</p><p>29 We form a query from each stipulated set of characteristics, compute the values of these queries heuristically, and then fire a feature based on each query’s signature. [sent-62, score-0.243]
</p><p>30 Signatures indicate which attachment properties were considered, which part of the query was lexicalized (shown by brackets here), and the POS of the query word. [sent-63, score-0.468]
</p><p>31 two worlds in that our features any treebank  or treebanks  but still exploit highly  can be learned on  that are available  specific  lexical  to us,  information  to achieve performance gains over using coarse POS  features alone. [sent-65, score-0.589]
</p><p>32 The ATTACH features for a given dependency link consist of indicators of the tags of the head and modifier, separately as well as together. [sent-70, score-0.17]
</p><p>33 The INBETWEEN and SURROUNDING features are indicators on the tags of the head and modifier in addition to each intervening tag in turn (INBETWEEN) or various combinations of tags adjacent to the head or modifier (SURROUNDING). [sent-71, score-0.241]
</p><p>34 3 MSTParser by default also includes a copy of each of these indicator features conjoined with the direction and distance of the attachment it denotes. [sent-72, score-0.244]
</p><p>35 We slightly modify the conjunction scheme and expand it with additional backed-off conjunctions, since  these changes lead to features that empirically transfer better than the MSTParser defaults. [sent-77, score-0.332]
</p><p>36 Specifically, we use conjunctions with attachment direction (left or right), coarsened distance,4 and attachment direction and coarsened distance combined. [sent-78, score-0.42]
</p><p>37 We emphasize again that these baseline features are entirely standard, and all the DELEX feature set does is recreate an MSTParser-based analogue ofthe direct transfer parser described by McDonald et al. [sent-79, score-0.404]
</p><p>38 2 PROJ Features We will now describe how to compute our projected lexical features, the PROJ feature set, which constitutes the main contribution of this work. [sent-82, score-0.164]
</p><p>39 Recall that we wish our method to be as general as possible and work under many different training conditions; in particular, we wish to be able to train our model on only existing treebanks in other languages when no target language trees are available (discussed in Section 3. [sent-83, score-0.447]
</p><p>40 3), or on only a very small target language treebank (Section 3. [sent-84, score-0.168]
</p><p>41 We instead must augment our baseline model with a relatively small number of features that are nonetheless rich enough to transfer the necessary lexical information. [sent-88, score-0.388]
</p><p>42 Our overall approach is sketched in Figure 2, where we show the features that fire on two proposed edges in a German dependency parse. [sent-89, score-0.178]
</p><p>43 For sets of properties that do not include a lexical item, such as VERB→NOUN, we fire an indicator feature from the DEL→EX feature set. [sent-91, score-0.28]
</p><p>44 Rather than firing the query as an indicator feature directly, which would result in a model parameter for each target word, we fire a broad feature called an signature whose value reflects the specifics of the query (computation of these values is discussed in Section 2. [sent-93, score-0.625]
</p><p>45 Our signatures allow us to instantiate features at different levels of granularity corresponding to the levels of granularity in the DELEX feature set. [sent-101, score-0.29]
</p><p>46 Therefore, our feature set manages to provide the training procedure with choices about how much syntactic information to transfer at the same time as it prevents  overfitting and provides language independence. [sent-104, score-0.352]
</p><p>47 1 Query and Signature Types A query is a subset of the following pieces of information about an edge: parent word, parent POS, child word, child POS, attachment direction, and binned attachment distance. [sent-107, score-0.645]
</p><p>48 The non-empty subset of attachment properties included in the query 2. [sent-111, score-0.339]
</p><p>49 aAt sw an example, t h×e queries verlangen → NOUN verlangen → ADP sprechen → NOUN  all share the signature [VERB]→CHILD, but verlangen → NOUN,RIGHT Verzicht → ADP VERB → Verzicht have [VERB]→CHILD,DIR, [ADP]→CHILD, and PARENT→[NOUN] as their signatures, respectively. [sent-115, score-0.776]
</p><p>50 The le→vel[ of granularity for signatures is a parameter that simply must be engineered. [sent-116, score-0.174]
</p><p>51 We found some benefit in actually instantiating two signatures for every query, one as described above and one that 5Bilexical features are possible in our framework, but we do not use them here, so for clarity we assume that each query has one associated word. [sent-117, score-0.315]
</p><p>52 We then compute relative frequency counts for each possible query type to get source language scores, which will later be projected through the dictionary to obtain target language feature values. [sent-121, score-0.454]
</p><p>53 2 Query Value Estimation Each query is given a value according  to a gener-  ative heuristic that involves the source training data and the probabilistic  bilingual  lexicon. [sent-127, score-0.428]
</p><p>54 , wt) where wt is the target language query word and the xi are the values of the included language-independent attachment properties. [sent-131, score-0.456]
</p><p>55 The value this feature takes is given by a simple generative model: we imagine generating the attachment properties xi given wt by first generating a source 7Lexicons such as those produced by automatic aligners include probabilities natively, but obviously human-created lexicons do not.

</p><p>56 5 word ws from wt based on the bilingual lexicon, then jointly generating the xi conditioned on ws. [sent-135, score-0.359]
</p><p>57 In addition, we consider two different sources for our bilingual lexicon: AUTOMATIC: Extracted from bitext MANUAL: Constructed from human annotations Both bitexts and human-curated bilingual dictionaries are more widely available than complete treebanks. [sent-161, score-0.743]
</p><p>58 We show results of our method on bilingual dictionaries derived from both sources, in order to show that it is applicable under a variety of data conditions and can successfully take advantage of such resources as are available. [sent-163, score-0.34]
</p><p>59 We make use of dependency treebanks for Danish, German, Greek, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, and Swedish, all from the 2006 shared task. [sent-167, score-0.263]
</p><p>60 (201 1), we strip punctuation from all treebanks for the results of Section 3. [sent-177, score-0.215]
</p><p>61 All results are given in terms of unlabeled attachment score (UAS), ignoring punctuation even when it is present. [sent-179, score-0.164]
</p><p>62 We use the Europarl  parallel  corpus  (Koehn,  2005) as the bitext from which to extract the AUTOMATIC bilingual lexicons. [sent-180, score-0.422]
</p><p>63 For each target language, we produce one-to-one  alignments  on the English-  target bitext by running the Berkeley Aligner (Liang et al. [sent-181, score-0.336]
</p><p>64 Coverage of rare words in the treebank is less important when a given word must also appear in the bilingual lexicon as the translation ofan observed German word in order to be useful. [sent-183, score-0.425]

</p><p>67 (2012) and improvements from their best methods of using bitext and lexical information. [sent-202, score-0.198]
</p><p>68 However, we still see that the performance of our type-level transfer method approaches that of bitext-based methods, which require complex bilingual training for each new language. [sent-204, score-0.528]
</p><p>69 We also use our method on bilingual dictionaries constructed in a more conventional way. [sent-207, score-0.286]
</p><p>70 For this purpose, we scrape our MANUAL bilingual lexicons from English Wiktionary (Wikimedia Foundation, 2012). [sent-208, score-0.437]
</p><p>71 Finally, because our method requires a dictionary with probability weights, we assume that each target language word translates with uniform probability into any of the candidates that we scrape. [sent-211, score-0.162]
</p><p>72 Training our PROJ features on the non-English treebanks in this concatenation can be understood as trying to learn which lexico-syntactic properties transfer “universally,” or at least transfer broadly within the families of languages we are considering. [sent-217, score-0.993]

</p><p>76 4  SEED  We now turn our attention to the SEED scenario, where a small number of target language trees are available for each language we consider. [sent-232, score-0.149]
</p><p>77 While it is imaginable to continue to exploit the other treebanks in the presence of target language trees, we found that training our DELEX features on the seed treebank alone gave higher performance than any 10The baseline of T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. [sent-233, score-0.52]
</p><p>78 8 attempt to also use the concatenation of treebanks from the previous section. [sent-235, score-0.215]
</p><p>79 This is not too surprising because, with this number of sentences, there is already good monolingual coverage of coarse POS features, and attempting to train features on other  languages can be expected to introduce noise into otherwise accurate monolingual feature weights. [sent-236, score-0.268]
</p><p>80 We train our DELEX+PROJ model with both AUTOMATIC and MANUAL lexicons on target language training sets of size 100, 200, and 400, and give results for each language in Table 2. [sent-237, score-0.244]
</p><p>81 The performance of parsers trained on small numbers of trees can be highly variable, so we create multiple treebanks of each size by repeatedly sampling from each language’s train treebank, and report averaged results. [sent-238, score-0.325]
</p><p>82 These are not comparable to the other values in the table because we are using our projection strategy monolingually, which removes the barriers of imperfect lexical correspondence (from using the lexicon) and imperfect syntactic correspondence (from projecting). [sent-244, score-0.173]
</p><p>83 As one might expect, the gains on English are far higher than the gains on other languages. [sent-245, score-0.17]
</p><p>84 We conclude that ac-  curately learning which signatures transfer between languages is important, and it is easier to learn good feature weights when some target language data is available. [sent-251, score-0.634]
</p><p>85 1 AUTOMATIC versus MANUAL Overall, we see that gains from using our MANUAL lexicons are slightly lower than those from our AUTOMATIC lexicons. [sent-254, score-0.232]
</p><p>86 One might expect higher performance because scraped bilingual lexicons are not prone to some of the same noise that exists in auto9  AVUoTcOMOATCICCVMocANUOACLC  Table 3: Lexicon statistics for all languages for both sources of bilingual lexicons. [sent-255, score-0.718]
</p><p>87 “Voc” indicates vocabulary size and “OCC” indicates open-class coverage, the fraction of open-class tokens in the test treebanks with entries in our bilingual lexicon. [sent-256, score-0.459]
</p><p>88 Rather, as we see in Table 3, the low recall of our MANUAL lexicons on open-class words appears to be a possible culprit. [sent-258, score-0.147]
</p><p>89 The coverage gap between these and the AUTOMATIC lexicons is partially due to the inconsistent structure of Wiktionary: inflected German and Greek words often do not have their own pages, so we miss even common morphological variants of verb forms in those languages. [sent-259, score-0.289]
</p><p>90 One might hypothesize that our uniform weighting scheme in the MANUAL lexicon is another source of problems, and that bitext-derived weights are necessary to get high performance. [sent-262, score-0.165]
</p><p>91 The English verb want takes fundamentally different children than wollen does, so properties of the sort we present in Section 2. [sent-267, score-0.168]
</p><p>92 Bitext is not necessary for our approach to work, and results on the AUTOMATIC lexicon suggest that our type-level transfer method can in fact do much better given a higher quality resource. [sent-270, score-0.394]
</p><p>93 2  Limitations  While our method does provide consistent  gains  across a range of languages, the injection of lexical information is clearly not sufficient to bridge the gap between unsupervised and supervised parsers. [sent-272, score-0.178]
</p><p>94 4 that the cross-lingual transfer step of our method imposes a fundamental limitation on how useful any such approach can be, which we now investigate further. [sent-274, score-0.284]
</p><p>95 While it is still broadly true that want and wollen both have verbal elements located to their right, it is less clear how to design features that can still take advantage of this while working around the differences we have described. [sent-279, score-0.149]
</p><p>96 Therefore, a gap between the per10 formance of our features on English and the perfor-  mance of our projected features, as is observed in Table 2, is to be expected in the absence of a more complete model of syntactic divergence. [sent-280, score-0.16]
</p><p>97 5  Conclusion  In this work, we showed that lexical attachment preferences can be projected to a target language at the type level using only a bilingual lexicon, improving over a delexicalized baseline parser. [sent-281, score-0.752]
</p><p>98 This method is broadly applicable in the presence or absence of target language training trees and with bilingual lexicons derived from either manually-annotated resources or bitexts. [sent-282, score-0.573]
</p><p>99 The greatest improvements arise when the bilingual lexicon has high coverage and a number of target language trees are available in order to learn exactly what lexico-syntactic properties transfer from the source language. [sent-283, score-0.927]
</p><p>100 While unsupervised and existing projection methods do feature great versatility and may yet produce state-of-the-art parsers on resource-poor languages, spending time constructing small supervised  resources appears to be the fastest method to achieve high performance in these settings.

<p>Author: Akihiro Tamura ; Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for lexicon extraction that extracts translation pairs from comparable corpora by using graphbased label propagation. In previous work, it was established that performance drastically decreases when the coverage of a seed lexicon is small. We resolve this problem by utilizing indirect relations with the bilingual seeds together with direct relations, in which each word is represented by a distribution of translated seeds. The seed distributions are propagated over a graph representing relations among words, and translation pairs are extracted by identifying word pairs with a high similarity in the seed distributions. We propose two types of the graphs: a co-occurrence graph, representing co-occurrence relations between words, and a similarity graph, representing context similarities between words. Evaluations using English and Japanese patent comparable corpora show that our proposed graph propagation method outperforms conventional methods. Further, the similarity graph achieved improved performance by clustering synonyms into the same translation.</p><p>4 0.1437999 <a title="123-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Transition-Based_System_for_Joint_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_and_Labeled_Non-Projective_Dependency_Parsing.html">12 emnlp-2012-A Transition-Based System for Joint Part-of-Speech Tagging and Labeled Non-Projective Dependency Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Shen Li ; Joao Graca ; Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: Despite significant recent work, purely unsupervised techniques for part-of-speech (POS) tagging have not achieved useful accuracies required by many language processing tasks. Use of parallel text between resource-rich and resource-poor languages is one source ofweak supervision that significantly improves accuracy. However, parallel text is not always available and techniques for using it require multiple complex algorithmic steps. In this paper we show that we can build POS-taggers exceeding state-of-the-art bilingual methods by using simple hidden Markov models and a freely available and naturally growing resource, the Wiktionary. Across eight languages for which we have labeled data to evaluate results, we achieve accuracy that significantly exceeds best unsupervised and parallel text methods. We achieve highest accuracy reported for several languages and show that our . approach yields better out-of-domain taggers than those trained using fully supervised Penn Treebank.</p><p>6 0.12853558 <a title="123-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Generalized_Higher-Order_Dependency_Parsing_with_Cube_Pruning.html">57 emnlp-2012-Generalized Higher-Order Dependency Parsing with Cube Pruning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jayant Krishnamurthy ; Tom Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for training a semantic parser using only a knowledge base and an unlabeled text corpus, without any individually annotated sentences. Our key observation is that multiple forms ofweak supervision can be combined to train an accurate semantic parser: semantic supervision from a knowledge base, and syntactic supervision from dependencyparsed sentences. We apply our approach to train a semantic parser that uses 77 relations from Freebase in its knowledge representation. This semantic parser extracts instances of binary relations with state-of-theart accuracy, while simultaneously recovering much richer semantic structures, such as conjunctions of multiple relations with partially shared arguments. We demonstrate recovery of this richer structure by extracting logical forms from natural language queries against Freebase. On this task, the trained semantic parser achieves 80% precision and 56% recall, despite never having seen an annotated logical form.</p><p>3 0.57124871 <a title="123-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_to_Map_into_a_Universal_POS_Tagset.html">81 emnlp-2012-Learning to Map into a Universal POS Tagset</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexander Rush ; Roi Reichart ; Michael Collins ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art statistical parsers and POS taggers perform very well when trained with large amounts of in-domain data. When training data is out-of-domain or limited, accuracy degrades. In this paper, we aim to compensate for the lack of available training data by exploiting similarities between test set sentences. We show how to augment sentencelevel models for parsing and POS tagging with inter-sentence consistency constraints. To deal with the resulting global objective, we present an efficient and exact dual decomposition decoding algorithm. In experiments, we add consistency constraints to the MST parser and the Stanford part-of-speech tagger and demonstrate significant error reduction in the domain adaptation and the lightly supervised settings across five languages.</p><p>5 0.56667471 <a title="123-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Transition-Based_System_for_Joint_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_and_Labeled_Non-Projective_Dependency_Parsing.html">12 emnlp-2012-A Transition-Based System for Joint Part-of-Speech Tagging and Labeled Non-Projective Dependency Parsing</a></p>

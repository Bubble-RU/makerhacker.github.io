<p>Author: Bernd Bohnet ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Most current dependency parsers presuppose that input words have been morphologically disambiguated using a part-of-speech tagger before parsing begins. We present a transitionbased system for joint part-of-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with nonprojective trees. Experimental evaluation on Chinese, Czech, English and German shows consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy when compared to a pipeline system, which lead to improved state-of-theart results for all languages.</p><p>3 0.1301572 <a title="66-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Generalized_Higher-Order_Dependency_Parsing_with_Cube_Pruning.html">57 emnlp-2012-Generalized Higher-Order Dependency Parsing with Cube Pruning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Zhang ; Ryan McDonald</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art graph-based parsers use features over higher-order dependencies that rely on decoding algorithms that are slow and difficult to generalize. On the other hand, transition-based dependency parsers can easily utilize such features without increasing the linear complexity of the shift-reduce system beyond a constant. In this paper, we attempt to address this imbalance for graph-based parsing by generalizing the Eisner (1996) algorithm to handle arbitrary features over higherorder dependencies. The generalization is at the cost of asymptotic efficiency. To account for this, cube pruning for decoding is utilized (Chiang, 2007). For the first time, label tuple and structural features such as valencies can be scored efficiently with third-order features in a graph-based parser. Our parser achieves the state-of-art unlabeled accuracy of 93.06% and labeled accuracy of 91.86% on the standard test set for English, at a faster speed than a reimplementation ofthe third-ordermodel of Koo et al. (2010).</p><p>4 0.1060586 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Unified_Dependency_Parsing_of_Chinese_Morphological_and_Syntactic_Structures.html">131 emnlp-2012-Unified Dependency Parsing of Chinese Morphological and Syntactic Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongguo Li ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Most previous approaches to syntactic parsing of Chinese rely on a preprocessing step of word segmentation, thereby assuming there was a clearly defined boundary between morphology and syntax in Chinese. We show how this assumption can fail badly, leading to many out-of-vocabulary words and incompatible annotations. Hence in practice the strict separation of morphology and syntax in the Chinese language proves to be untenable. We present a unified dependency parsing approach for Chinese which takes unsegmented sentences as input and outputs both morphological and syntactic structures with a single model and algorithm. By removing the intermediate word segmentation, the unified parser no longer needs separate notions for words and phrases. Evaluation proves the effectiveness of the unified model and algorithm in parsing structures of words, phrases and sen- tences simultaneously. 1</p><p>5 0.078556813 <a title="66-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Mixed_Membership_Markov_Models_for_Unsupervised_Conversation_Modeling.html">89 emnlp-2012-Mixed Membership Markov Models for Unsupervised Conversation Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael J. Paul</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of hidden Markov models for unsupervised discourse and conversation modeling, where each segment or block of text such as a message in a conversation is associated with a hidden state in a sequence. We extend this approach to allow each block of text to be a mixture of multiple classes. Under our model, the probability of a class in a text block is a log-linear function of the classes in the previous block. We show that this model performs well at predictive tasks on two conversation data sets, improving thread reconstruction accuracy by up to 15 percentage points over a standard HMM. Additionally, we show quantitatively that the induced word clusters correspond to speech acts more closely than baseline models.</p><p>6 0.073716961 <a title="66-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Chinese_Word_Segmentation%2C_POS_Tagging_and_Parsing.html">70 emnlp-2012-Joint Chinese Word Segmentation, POS Tagging and Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Annie Louis ; Ani Nenkova</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a model of coherence which captures the intentional discourse structure in text. Our work is based on the hypothesis that syntax provides a proxy for the communicative goal of a sentence and therefore the sequence of sentences in a coherent discourse should exhibit detectable structural patterns. Results show that our method has high discriminating power for separating out coherent and incoherent news articles reaching accuracies of up to 90%. We also show that our syntactic patterns are correlated with manual annotations of intentional structure for academic conference articles and can successfully predict the coherence of abstract, introduction and related work sections of these articles. 59.3 (100.0) Intro 50.3 (100.0) 1166 Rel wk 55.4 (100.0) >= 0.663.8 (67.2)50.8 (71.1)58.6 (75.9) >= 0.7 67.2 (32.0) 54.4 (38.6) 63.3 (52.8) >= 0.8 74.0 (10.0) 51.6 (22.0) 63.0 (25.7) >= 0.9 91.7 (2.0) 30.6 (5.0) 68.1 (7.2) Table 9: Accuracy (% examples) above each confidence level for the conference versus workshop task. These results are shown in Table 9. The proportion of examples under each setting is also indicated. When only examples above 0.6 confidence are examined, the classifier has a higher accuracy of63.8% for abstracts and covers close to 70% of the examples. Similarly, when a cutoff of 0.7 is applied to the confidence for predicting related work sections, we achieve 63.3% accuracy for 53% of examples. So we can consider that 30 to 47% of the examples in the two sections respectively are harder to tell apart. Interestingly however even high confidence predictions on introductions remain incorrect. These results show that our model can successfully distinguish the structure of articles beyond just clearly incoherent permutation examples. 7 Conclusion Our work is the first to develop an unsupervised model for intentional structure and to show that it has good accuracy for coherence prediction and also complements entity and lexical structure of discourse. This result raises interesting questions about how patterns captured by these different coherence metrics vary and how they can be combined usefully for predicting coherence. We plan to explore these ideas in future work. We also want to analyze genre differences to understand if the strength of these coherence dimensions varies with genre.

<p>Author: Bernd Bohnet ; Anders Bjorkelund ; Jonas Kuhn ; Wolfgang Seeker ; Sina Zarriess</p><p>Abstract: We propose a technique to generate nonprojective word orders in an efficient statistical linearization system. Our approach predicts liftings of edges in an unordered syntactic tree by means of a classifier, and uses a projective algorithm for tree linearization. We obtain statistically significant improvements on six typologically different languages: English, German, Dutch, Danish, Hungarian, and Czech.</p><p>4 0.59387767 <a title="66-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Parser_Showdown_at_the_Wall_Street_Corral%3A_An_Empirical_Investigation_of_Error_Types_in_Parser_Output.html">105 emnlp-2012-Parser Showdown at the Wall Street Corral: An Empirical Investigation of Error Types in Parser Output</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; David Hall ; James R. Curran ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Constituency parser performance is primarily interpreted through a single metric, F-score on WSJ section 23, that conveys no linguistic information regarding the remaining errors. We classify errors within a set of linguistically meaningful types using tree transformations that repair groups of errors together. We use this analysis to answer a range of questions about parser behaviour, including what linguistic constructions are difficult for stateof-the-art parsers, what types of errors are being resolved by rerankers, and what types are introduced when parsing out-of-domain text.</p><p>5 0.59271806 <a title="66-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Mixed_Membership_Markov_Models_for_Unsupervised_Conversation_Modeling.html">89 emnlp-2012-Mixed Membership Markov Models for Unsupervised Conversation Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael J. Paul</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of hidden Markov models for unsupervised discourse and conversation modeling, where each segment or block of text such as a message in a conversation is associated with a hidden state in a sequence. We extend this approach to allow each block of text to be a mixture of multiple classes. Under our model, the probability of a class in a text block is a log-linear function of the classes in the previous block. We show that this model performs well at predictive tasks on two conversation data sets, improving thread reconstruction accuracy by up to 15 percentage points over a standard HMM. Additionally, we show quantitatively that the induced word clusters correspond to speech acts more closely than baseline models.</p><p>6 0.59034467 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Dynamic_Programming_for_Higher_Order_Parsing_of_Gap-Minding_Trees.html">37 emnlp-2012-Dynamic Programming for Higher Order Parsing of Gap-Minding Trees</a></p>

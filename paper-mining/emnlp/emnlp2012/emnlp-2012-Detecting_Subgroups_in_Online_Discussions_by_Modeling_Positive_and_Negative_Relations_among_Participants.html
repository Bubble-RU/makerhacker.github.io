[sent-4, score-0.607]
</p><p>2 This allows us to build a signed network representation of discussions; where every edge has a sign: positive to denote a friendly relation, or negative to denote an antagonistic relation. [sent-11, score-1.058]
</p><p>3 We also connect our analysis to social psychology theories of balance. [sent-12, score-0.317]
</p><p>4 Inspired by that, we present a technique for identifying subgroups  in discussions by partitioning singed networks representing them. [sent-14, score-0.621]
</p><p>5 1 Introduction Most online communities involve a mixture of positive and negative relations between users. [sent-15, score-0.342]
</p><p>6 Most of the research on relations in social media applications has almost exclusively focused on positive links between individuals (e. [sent-18, score-0.522]
</p><p>7 We think that one of the main reasons, of why the interplay of positive and negative links did not receive enough attention, is the lack of a notion for explicitly expressing negative interactions. [sent-22, score-0.464]
</p><p>8 However, all studies have been limited to a handful of datasets from applications that allow users to explicitly label relations as either positive or 59 negative (e. [sent-24, score-0.366]
</p><p>9 Predicting positive/negative relations between discussants is related to another well studied problem, namely debate stance recognition. [sent-29, score-0.354]
</p><p>10 The objective of this problem is to identify which participants are supporting and which are opposing the topic being discussed. [sent-30, score-0.294]
</p><p>11 In this work, we apply Natural Language Processing techniques to text correspondences exchanged between individuals to identify the underlying signed social structure in online communities. [sent-34, score-0.912]
</p><p>12 We present a method for identifying user attitude and for automatically constructing a signed social network representation of discussions. [sent-35, score-1.155]
</p><p>13 We also conduct a large scale evaluation by showing that predicted links are con-  sistent with the principals of social psychology theories, namely the Structural Balance Theory (Heider, 1946). [sent-38, score-0.344]
</p><p>14 Finally, we present a method for identifying subgroups in online discussions by identifying groups with high density of intra-group positive relations and high density of inter-group negative relations. [sent-41, score-0.795]
</p><p>15 This method is capable of identifying subgroups even if the community splits into more than two subgroups which is more general than stance recognition which assumes that only two groups exist. [sent-42, score-0.684]
</p><p>16 Figure 1: An example showing a signed social network along with evidence from text that justifies edge signs. [sent-50, score-0.959]
</p><p>17 The output is a signed network where edges signify the existence of an interaction between two users. [sent-54, score-0.783]
</p><p>18 The resulting network has polarity associated with every edge. [sent-55, score-0.334]
</p><p>19 Edge polarity is a means for indicating positive or negative affinity between two individuals. [sent-56, score-0.381]
</p><p>20 Figure 1 shows a signed network representation for a subset of posts from a long discussion thread. [sent-57, score-0.906]
</p><p>21 We also notice that most negative edges are between groups, and most positive edges are within groups. [sent-60, score-0.386]
</p><p>22 In section 2, we review some of the related prior work  on mining sentiment from text, mining online discussions, extracting social networks from text, and analyzing signed social networks. [sent-65, score-1.201]
</p><p>23 We present a method for identifying subgroups in online discussions in Section 3. [sent-69, score-0.421]
</p><p>24 1 Mining Sentiment from Text Our general goal of mining attitude from one individual toward another makes our work related to a huge body of work on sentiment analysis. [sent-74, score-0.312]
</p><p>25 Our method is not restricted to phrases or words, rather it generalizes this to identifying the polarity of an interaction between two individuals based on several posts they exchange. [sent-82, score-0.61]
</p><p>26 We notice that most of these methods focus on the polarity of the written text assuming that anyone using positive text belongs to one group and anyone using negative text belongs to another. [sent-85, score-0.526]
</p><p>27 In such complex topics, people use positive and negative text targeting different aspects of the topic, for example in the health care bill topic, discussants expressed their opinion regarding many aspects including: the enlarged coverage, the insurance premiums, Obama, socialism, etc. [sent-96, score-0.477]
</p><p>28 We found out that many instances with references to other discussants were labeled as neither agreement nor disagreement regardless of whether the discussants have similar or opposing positions. [sent-109, score-0.445]
</p><p>29 Our approach is different from agreement/disagreement identification because we not only study sentiment at the local sentiment level but also at the global level that takes into consideration many posts exchanged between participants to build a signed network representation of the discussion. [sent-131, score-1.165]
</p><p>30 After building the signed network representation of discussions, we present a method that can detect how the large group could split into many subgroups (not necessarily two) with coherent opinions. [sent-135, score-0.837]
</p><p>31 3 Extracting Social Networks from Text Little work has been done on the front of extracting social relations between individuals from text. [sent-137, score-0.384]
</p><p>32 (2010) present a method for extracting social networks from nineteenth-century British novels and serials. [sent-139, score-0.444]
</p><p>33 (2007) explored the use of structured data such as email headers for social network construction. [sent-142, score-0.419]
</p><p>34 Gruzd and Hyrthonthwaite (2008) explored the use of post text in discussions to study interaction patterns in e-learning communities. [sent-143, score-0.303]
</p><p>35 Despite similarities, our work is uniquely characterized by the fact that we extract signed social networks with both positive and negative links from text. [sent-150, score-1.168]
</p><p>36 4 Signed Social Networks Most of the work on social networks analysis has only focused on positive interactions. [sent-152, score-0.521]
</p><p>37 (2008) study the positive and negative relationships between users of Essembly. [sent-155, score-0.312]
</p><p>38 Essembly is an ideological social network that distinguishes between ideological allies and nemeses. [sent-156, score-0.509]
</p><p>39 Slashdot allows users of the website to tag other users as friends or foes, providing positive and negative endorsements. [sent-159, score-0.368]
</p><p>40 (2010b) study signed social networks generated from Slashdot, Epinions, and Wikipedia. [sent-161, score-0.851]
</p><p>41 They also connect their analysis to theories of signed networks from social psychology. [sent-162, score-0.885]
</p><p>42 A similar study used the same datasets for predicting positive and negative links given their context (Leskovec et al. [sent-163, score-0.317]
</p><p>43 All this work has been limited to analyzing a  handful of datasets for which an explicit notion of both positive and negative relations exists. [sent-165, score-0.31]
</p><p>44 Our work goes beyond this limitation by leveraging the power of natural language processing to automate the discovery of signed social networks using the text embedded in the network. [sent-166, score-0.888]
</p><p>45 1 Identifying Attitude from Text To build a signed network representation of discus-  sants, we start by trying to identify sentences that show positive or negative attitude from the writer to the addressee. [sent-169, score-1.137]
</p><p>46 The first step toward identifying attitude is to identify words with positive/negative semantic orientation. [sent-170, score-0.362]
</p><p>47 While every sentence that shows an attitude is a subjective sentence, not every subjective sentence shows an attitude toward the recipient. [sent-184, score-0.666]
</p><p>48 In this method, we address the problem of identifying sentences with attitude as a relation detection problem in a supervised learning setting. [sent-185, score-0.363]
</p><p>49 2 Extracting the Signed Network In this subsection, we describe the procedure we used to build the signed network given the component we described in the previous subsection. [sent-216, score-0.617]
</p><p>50 We add a directed edge A → B, if A replies to B’s posts at least rne ctitemdes e digne em A d →iffe Bre,n ift Athr reeapdlise. [sent-222, score-0.345]
</p><p>51 We have shown in the previous section how sentences with positive and negative attitude can be extracted from text. [sent-234, score-0.489]
</p><p>52 Unfortunately the sign of an interaction cannot be trivially inferred from the polarity of sentences. [sent-235, score-0.331]
</p><p>53 One way to solve this problem would be to compare the number of negative sentences to positive sentences in all posts between A and B and classify the interaction according to the plurality value. [sent-237, score-0.62]
</p><p>54 Each member of a group is more likely to show positive attitude to members of the same group, and negative attitude to members of opposing groups. [sent-251, score-0.812]
</p><p>55 The signed network representation could prove to be very useful for identifying those subgroups. [sent-252, score-0.681]
</p><p>56 To detect subgroups in a discussion thread, we would like to partition the corresponding signed network such that positive intra-group links and negative inter-group links are dense. [sent-253, score-1.258]
</p><p>57 Correlation clustering operates in a scenario where given a signed graph G = (V, E) where the edge label indicates whether two nodes are similar (+) or different (-), the task is to cluster the vertices so that similar objects are grouped together. [sent-258, score-0.503]
</p><p>58 A criterion function for a local optimization partitioning procedure is constructed such that positive links are dense within groups and negative links are dense between groups. [sent-262, score-0.439]
</p><p>59 All threads were in English and had 5 posts or more. [sent-281, score-0.316]
</p><p>60 We randomly selected around 5300 posts (1000 interactions), and asked human annotators to label them. [sent-286, score-0.314]
</p><p>61 Our annotators were instructed to read all the posts exchanged between two participants and decide whether the interaction between them is positive or negative. [sent-287, score-0.722]
</p><p>62 Annotators were asked to select sentences where the polarized attribute is referring to the mention and hence show a positive or negative attitude toward other discussion participants. [sent-297, score-0.744]
</p><p>63 2 Sub-group Detection We used a dataset of more than 42 topics and approximately 9000 posts collected from two political forums (Createdebate1 and Politicalforum2). [sent-321, score-0.29]
</p><p>64 The forum administrators ran a poll asking participants to select their stance from a set of possible answers and hence the dataset was self-labeled with respect  to groups. [sent-322, score-0.317]
</p><p>65 We built one signed social network for every domain (e. [sent-340, score-0.889]
</p><p>66 We decided to build a network for every domain as opposed to one single network because the relation between any two individuals may vary across domains (e. [sent-344, score-0.476]
</p><p>67 In the rest of this section, we will describe the experiments we did to assess the performance of the sentences with attitude detection and interaction sign prediction steps. [sent-348, score-0.504]
</p><p>68 To better assess the performance of the proposed classifier, we compare it to a baseline that labels the relation as negative if the percentage of negative sentences exceeds a particular threshold, otherwise it is labeled as positive. [sent-404, score-0.403]
</p><p>69 The first is a random baseline that predicts an interaction as positive with probability p that equals the proportion of positive instances to all instances in the training set. [sent-408, score-0.336]
</p><p>70 The second classifier (Thresh-Num) labels the edge as negative if the number of negative instances exceeds a threshold Tn. [sent-409, score-0.42]
</p><p>71 The third classifier (ThreshPerc) labels the edge as negative if the percentage of negative instances to all instances exceeds a threshold Tp. [sent-410, score-0.466]
</p><p>72 We tried to train a classifier using both the number and percentage of negative and positive posts. [sent-417, score-0.364]
</p><p>73 The improvement over using the baseline using the percentage of negative posts was not statistically significant. [sent-418, score-0.439]
</p><p>74 We found out that the features describing the interaction between the two participants are more informative than the ones describing individuals characteristics. [sent-420, score-0.312]
</p><p>75 The most informative features are: percentage of negative posts per tread, percentage of negative sentences per post, percentage of positive posts per thread, number of negative posts, and discussion domain. [sent-423, score-1.223]
</p><p>76 3  Structural Balance Theory  The structural balance theory is a psychological theory that tries to explain the dynamics of signed social interactions. [sent-425, score-0.885]
</p><p>77 The theory is based on the principles that “the friend of my friend is my friend”, “the enemy of my friend is my enemy”, “the friend of my enemy is my enemy”, and variations on these. [sent-431, score-0.498]
</p><p>78 The structural balance theory states that triangles that have an odd number of positive signs (+ + + and + - -) are balanced, while triangles that have an even number of positive signs (- - - and + + -) are not. [sent-432, score-0.721]
</p><p>79 In this section, we compare the predictions of edge signs made by our system to the structural balance theory by counting the frequencies of different types of triangles in the predicted network. [sent-433, score-0.399]
</p><p>80 We shuffle the signs for all edges on every network keeping  the fractions of positive and negative edges constant. [sent-436, score-0.651]
</p><p>81 This shows that the predicted networks mostly agree with the structural balance theory. [sent-441, score-0.345]
</p><p>82 The slightly non standard behavior of the triangle with one positive edge could be explained in light of the weak balance theory. [sent-442, score-0.312]
</p><p>83 The first baseline uses graph clustering (GC) to partition a network based on the frequency of interaction between participants. [sent-447, score-0.296]
</p><p>84 Edges link participants if they exchange posts, and edge weights are based on the number of posts exchanged. [sent-449, score-0.447]
</p><p>85 In this baseline we put all the participants who use more positive text in one subgroup  and the participants who use more negative text in another subgroup. [sent-458, score-0.682]
</p><p>86 Table 6 shows the average purity (Purity), entropy (Entropy), Normalizes Mutual Information (NMI), and Rand Index (RandIndex) values of the method based on signed networks and the baselines using different partitioning algorithms. [sent-461, score-0.71]
</p><p>87 05 level (as indicated by a 2-tailed  Figure 2: A signed network representing participants in a discussion about the “Health Care Reform Bill”. [sent-463, score-0.797]
</p><p>88 Blue (dark) nodes represent participants with the bill, Yellow (light) nodes represent participants against the bill, red (solid) edges represent negative attitude, while green (dashed) edges represent positive attitude. [sent-464, score-0.626]
</p><p>89 We notice that partitioning the signed network that was automatically extracted from text results in  significantly better partitions on the three datasets as indicated by the higher Purity, NMI, and RandIndex and the lower Entropy values it achieves. [sent-478, score-0.749]
</p><p>90 We believe that the first two baselines performed poorly because the interaction frequency and the text similarity are not key factors in identifying subgroup structures. [sent-479, score-0.297]
</p><p>91 Also, people in opposing subgroups tend to use very similar text when discussing the same topic and hence text clustering does not work as well. [sent-481, score-0.454]
</p><p>92 An example of a signed network and the corresponding subgtoups as extracted from real data is showm in Figure 2. [sent-483, score-0.617]
</p><p>93 68 6  Conclusions  In this paper, we have shown that natural language processing techniques can be reliably used to extract  signed social networks from text correspondences. [sent-484, score-0.888]
</p><p>94 We believe that this work brings us closer to understanding the relation between language use and social interactions and opens the door to further research efforts that go beyond standard social network analysis by studying the interplay of positive and negative connections. [sent-485, score-1.02]
</p><p>95 We rigorously evaluated the proposed methods on labeled data and connected our analysis to social psychology theories to show that our predictions mostly agree with them. [sent-486, score-0.362]

<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: A mixture of positive (friendly) and negative (antagonistic) relations exist among users in most social media applications. However, many such applications do not allow users to explicitly express the polarity of their interactions. As a result most research has either ignored negative links or was limited to the few domains where such relations are explicitly expressed (e.g. Epinions trust/distrust). We study text exchanged between users in online communities. We find that the polarity of the links between users can be predicted with high accuracy given the text they exchange. This allows us to build a signed network representation of discussions; where every edge has a sign: positive to denote a friendly relation, or negative to denote an antagonistic relation. We also connect our analysis to social psychology theories of balance. We show that the automatically predicted networks are consistent with those theories.

<p>Author: Lizhen Qu ; Rainer Gemulla ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: We propose the weakly supervised MultiExperts Model (MEM) for analyzing the semantic orientation of opinions expressed in natural language reviews. In contrast to most prior work, MEM predicts both opinion polarity and opinion strength at the level of individual sentences; such fine-grained analysis helps to understand better why users like or dislike the entity under review. A key challenge in this setting is that it is hard to obtain sentence-level training data for both polarity and strength. For this reason, MEM is weakly supervised: It starts with potentially noisy indicators obtained from coarse-grained training data (i.e., document-level ratings), a small set of diverse base predictors, and, if available, small amounts of fine-grained training data. We integrate these noisy indicators into a unified probabilistic framework using ideas from ensemble learning and graph-based semi-supervised learning. Our experiments indicate that MEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.</p><p>3 0.1116783 <a title="32-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Collocation_Polarity_Disambiguation_Using_Web-based_Pseudo_Contexts.html">28 emnlp-2012-Collocation Polarity Disambiguation Using Web-based Pseudo Contexts</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanyan Zhao ; Bing Qin ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of collocation polarity disambiguation. The collocation refers to a binary tuple of a polarity word and a target (such as ⟨long, battery life⟩ or ⟨long, ast atratrguep⟩t) (, siunc whh aisch ⟨ ltohneg s,en btatitmeernyt l iofrei⟩en otrat ⟨iolonn gof, tshtaer polarity wwohirdch (“long”) changes along owniothf different targets (“battery life” or “startup”). To disambiguate a collocation’s polarity, previous work always turned to investigate the polarities of its surrounding contexts, and then assigned the majority polarity to the collocation. However, these contexts are limited, thus the resulting polarity is insufficient to be reliable. We therefore propose an unsupervised three-component framework to expand some pseudo contexts from web, to help disambiguate a collocation’s polarity.Without using any additional labeled data, experiments , show that our method is effective.</p><p>4 0.0989713 <a title="32-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-User_Demographics_and_Language_in_an_Implicit_Social_Network.html">134 emnlp-2012-User Demographics and Language in an Implicit Social Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Katja Filippova</p><p>Abstract: We consider the task of predicting the gender of the YouTube1 users and contrast two information sources: the comments they leave and the social environment induced from the affiliation graph of users and videos. We propagate gender information through the videos and show that a user’s gender can be predicted from her social environment with the accuracy above 90%.

<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: A mixture of positive (friendly) and negative (antagonistic) relations exist among users in most social media applications. However, many such applications do not allow users to explicitly express the polarity of their interactions. As a result most research has either ignored negative links or was limited to the few domains where such relations are explicitly expressed (e.g. Epinions trust/distrust). We study text exchanged between users in online communities. We find that the polarity of the links between users can be predicted with high accuracy given the text they exchange. This allows us to build a signed network representation of discussions; where every edge has a sign: positive to denote a friendly relation, or negative to denote an antagonistic relation. We also connect our analysis to social psychology theories of balance. We show that the automatically predicted networks are consistent with those theories. Inspired by that, we present a technique for identifying subgroups in discussions by partitioning singed networks representing them.</p><p>2 0.58112872 <a title="32-lsi-2" href="./emnlp-2012-User_Demographics_and_Language_in_an_Implicit_Social_Network.html">134 emnlp-2012-User Demographics and Language in an Implicit Social Network</a></p>

<p>Author: Lizhen Qu ; Rainer Gemulla ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: We propose the weakly supervised MultiExperts Model (MEM) for analyzing the semantic orientation of opinions expressed in natural language reviews. In contrast to most prior work, MEM predicts both opinion polarity and opinion strength at the level of individual sentences; such fine-grained analysis helps to understand better why users like or dislike the entity under review. A key challenge in this setting is that it is hard to obtain sentence-level training data for both polarity and strength. For this reason, MEM is weakly supervised: It starts with potentially noisy indicators obtained from coarse-grained training data (i.e., document-level ratings), a small set of diverse base predictors, and, if available, small amounts of fine-grained training data. We integrate these noisy indicators into a unified probabilistic framework using ideas from ensemble learning and graph-based semi-supervised learning. Our experiments indicate that MEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.</p><p>5 0.43868905 <a title="32-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Streaming_Analysis_of_Discourse_Participants.html">120 emnlp-2012-Streaming Analysis of Discourse Participants</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: Inferring attributes of discourse participants has been treated as a batch-processing task: data such as all tweets from a given author are gathered in bulk, processed, analyzed for a particular feature, then reported as a result of academic interest. Given the sources and scale of material used in these efforts, along with potential use cases of such analytic tools, discourse analysis should be reconsidered as a streaming challenge. We show that under certain common formulations, the batchprocessing analytic framework can be decomposed into a sequential series of updates, using as an example the task of gender classification. Once in a streaming framework, and motivated by large data sets generated by social media services, we present novel results in approximate counting, showing its applicability to space efficient streaming classification.</p><p>6 0.42579859 <a title="32-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Collocation_Polarity_Disambiguation_Using_Web-based_Pseudo_Contexts.html">28 emnlp-2012-Collocation Polarity Disambiguation Using Web-based Pseudo Contexts</a></p>

<p>Author: David Hall ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: PCFGs can grow exponentially as additional annotations are added to an initially simple base grammar. We present an approach where multiple annotations coexist, but in a factored manner that avoids this combinatorial explosion. Our method works with linguisticallymotivated annotations, induced latent structure, lexicalization, or any mix of the three. We use a structured expectation propagation algorithm that makes use of the factored structure in two ways. First, by partitioning the factors, it speeds up parsing exponentially over the unfactored approach. Second, it minimizes the redundancy of the factors during training, improving accuracy over an independent approach. Using purely latent variable annotations, we can efficiently train and parse with up to 8 latent bits per symbol, achieving F1 scores up to 88.4 on the Penn Treebank while using two orders of magnitudes fewer parameters compared to the na¨ ıve approach. Combining latent, lexicalized, and unlexicalized anno- tations, our best parser gets 89.4 F1 on all sentences from section 23 of the Penn Treebank.</p><p>2 0.92025965 <a title="32-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2012-Semantic_Compositionality_through_Recursive_Matrix-Vector_Spaces.html">116 emnlp-2012-Semantic Compositionality through Recursive Matrix-Vector Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Brody Huval ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Single-word vector space models have been very successful at learning lexical information. However, they cannot capture the compositional meaning of longer phrases, preventing them from a deeper understanding of language. We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between nouns using the syntactic path between them.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.91272849 <a title="32-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Detecting_Subgroups_in_Online_Discussions_by_Modeling_Positive_and_Negative_Relations_among_Participants.html">32 emnlp-2012-Detecting Subgroups in Online Discussions by Modeling Positive and Negative Relations among Participants</a></p>

<p>Author: William Blacoe ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of modeling compositional meaning for phrases and sentences using distributional methods. We experiment with several possible combinations of representation and composition, exhibiting varying degrees of sophistication. Some are shallow while others operate over syntactic structure, rely on parameter learning, or require access to very large corpora. We find that shallow approaches are as good as more computationally intensive alternatives with regards to two particular tests: (1) phrase similarity and (2) paraphrase detection. The sizes of the involved training corpora and the generated vectors are not as important as the fit between the meaning representation and compositional method.</p><p>5 0.48136872 <a title="32-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Weakly_Supervised_Training_of_Semantic_Parsers.html">136 emnlp-2012-Weakly Supervised Training of Semantic Parsers</a></p>
<p>Author: Jayant Krishnamurthy ; Tom Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for training a semantic parser using only a knowledge base and an unlabeled text corpus, without any individually annotated sentences. Our key observation is that multiple forms ofweak supervision can be combined to train an accurate semantic parser: semantic supervision from a knowledge base, and syntactic supervision from dependencyparsed sentences. We apply our approach to train a semantic parser that uses 77 relations from Freebase in its knowledge representation. This semantic parser extracts instances of binary relations with state-of-theart accuracy, while simultaneously recovering much richer semantic structures, such as conjunctions of multiple relations with partially shared arguments. We demonstrate recovery of this richer structure by extracting logical forms from natural language queries against Freebase. On this task, the trained semantic parser achieves 80% precision and 56% recall, despite never having seen an annotated logical form.</p><p>6 0.47264269 <a title="32-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Re-training_Monolingual_Parser_Bilingually_for_Syntactic_SMT.html">109 emnlp-2012-Re-training Monolingual Parser Bilingually for Syntactic SMT</a></p>

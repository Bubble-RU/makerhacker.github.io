<p>Author: Kewei Tu ; Vasant Honavar</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach named unambiguity regularization for unsupervised learning of probabilistic natural language grammars. The approach is based on the observation that natural language is remarkably unambiguous in the sense that only a tiny portion of the large number of possible parses of a natural language sentence are syntactically valid. We incorporate an inductive bias into grammar learning in favor of grammars that lead to unambiguous parses on natural language sentences. The resulting family of algorithms includes the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM) and its variant, Viterbi EM, as well as a so-called softmax-EM algorithm. The softmax-EM algorithm can be implemented with a simple and computationally efficient extension to standard EM. In our experiments of unsupervised dependency grammar learn- ing, we show that unambiguity regularization is beneficial to learning, and in combination with annealing (of the regularization strength) and sparsity priors it leads to improvement over the current state of the art.</p><p>3 0.1625787 <a title="126-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Exploring_Adaptor_Grammars_for_Native_Language_Identification.html">48 emnlp-2012-Exploring Adaptor Grammars for Native Language Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Sze-Meng Jojo Wong ; Mark Dras ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: The task of inferring the native language of an author based on texts written in a second language has generally been tackled as a classification problem, typically using as features a mix of n-grams over characters and part of speech tags (for small and fixed n) and unigram function words. To capture arbitrarily long n-grams that syntax-based approaches have suggested are useful, adaptor grammars have some promise. In this work we investigate their extension to identifying n-gram collocations of arbitrary length over a mix of PoS tags and words, using both maxent and induced syntactic language model approaches to classification. After presenting a new, simple baseline, we show that learned collocations used as features in a maxent model perform better still, but that the story is more mixed for the syntactic language model.</p><p>4 0.16016141 <a title="126-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Three_Dependency-and-Boundary_Models_for_Grammar_Induction.html">124 emnlp-2012-Three Dependency-and-Boundary Models for Grammar Induction</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin I. Spitkovsky ; Hiyan Alshawi ; Daniel Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We present a new family of models for unsupervised parsing, Dependency and Boundary models, that use cues at constituent boundaries to inform head-outward dependency tree generation. We build on three intuitions that are explicit in phrase-structure grammars but only implicit in standard dependency formulations: (i) Distributions of words that occur at sentence boundaries such as English determiners resemble constituent edges. (ii) Punctuation at sentence boundaries further helps distinguish full sentences from fragments like headlines and titles, allowing us to model grammatical differences between complete and incomplete sentences. (iii) Sentence-internal punctuation boundaries help with longer-distance dependencies, since punctuation correlates with constituent edges. Our models induce state-of-the-art dependency grammars for many languages without — — special knowledge of optimal input sentence lengths or biased, manually-tuned initializers.</p><p>5 0.15214939 <a title="126-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Parser_Showdown_at_the_Wall_Street_Corral%3A_An_Empirical_Investigation_of_Error_Types_in_Parser_Output.html">105 emnlp-2012-Parser Showdown at the Wall Street Corral: An Empirical Investigation of Error Types in Parser Output</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; David Hall ; James R. Curran ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Constituency parser performance is primarily interpreted through a single metric, F-score on WSJ section 23, that conveys no linguistic information regarding the remaining errors. We classify errors within a set of linguistically meaningful types using tree transformations that repair groups of errors together. We use this analysis to answer a range of questions about parser behaviour, including what linguistic constructions are difficult for stateof-the-art parsers, what types of errors are being resolved by rerankers, and what types are introduced when parsing out-of-domain text.</p><p>6 0.14366683 <a title="126-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Learning_SCFGs_with_Discontiguous_Rules.html">1 emnlp-2012-A Bayesian Model for Learning SCFGs with Discontiguous Rules</a></p>

<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Adam Pauls ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of using a bilingual dictionary to transfer lexico-syntactic information from a resource-rich source language to a resource-poor target language. In contrast to past work that used bitexts to transfer analyses of specific sentences at the token level, we instead use features to transfer the behavior of words at a type level. In a discriminative dependency parsing framework, our approach produces gains across a range of target languages, using two different lowresource training methodologies (one weakly supervised and one indirectly supervised) and two different dictionary sources (one manually constructed and one automatically constructed).</p><p>3 0.77699989 <a title="126-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-N-gram-based_Tense_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">95 emnlp-2012-N-gram-based Tense Models for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengxian Gong ; Min Zhang ; Chew Lim Tan ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Tense is a small element to a sentence, however, error tense can raise odd grammars and result in misunderstanding. Recently, tense has drawn attention in many natural language processing applications. However, most of current Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems mainly depend on translation model and language model. They never consider and make full use of tense information. In this paper, we propose n-gram-based tense models for SMT and successfully integrate them into a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system via two additional features. Experimental results on the NIST Chinese-English translation task show that our proposed tense models are very effective, contributing performance improvement by 0.62 BLUE points over a strong baseline. 1</p><p>4 0.77195066 <a title="126-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Sequence_Labelling_Approach_to_Quote_Attribution.html">9 emnlp-2012-A Sequence Labelling Approach to Quote Attribution</a></p>
<p>Author: Timothy O'Keefe ; Silvia Pareti ; James R. Curran ; Irena Koprinska ; Matthew Honnibal</p><p>Abstract: Quote extraction and attribution is the task of automatically extracting quotes from text and attributing each quote to its correct speaker. The present state-of-the-art system uses gold standard information from previous decisions in its features, which, when removed, results in a large drop in performance. We treat the problem as a sequence labelling task, which allows us to incorporate sequence features without using gold standard information. We present results on two new corpora and an augmented version of a third, achieving a new state-of-the-art for systems using only realistic features.</p><p>5 0.67314112 <a title="126-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_Verb_Inference_Rules_from_Linguistically-Motivated_Evidence.html">80 emnlp-2012-Learning Verb Inference Rules from Linguistically-Motivated Evidence</a></p>
<p>Author: Hila Weisman ; Jonathan Berant ; Idan Szpektor ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: Learning inference relations between verbs is at the heart of many semantic applications. However, most prior work on learning such rules focused on a rather narrow set of information sources: mainly distributional similarity, and to a lesser extent manually constructed verb co-occurrence patterns. In this paper, we claim that it is imperative to utilize information from various textual scopes: verb co-occurrence within a sentence, verb cooccurrence within a document, as well as overall corpus statistics. To this end, we propose a much richer novel set of linguistically motivated cues for detecting entailment between verbs and combine them as features in a supervised classification framework. We empirically demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous methods and that information from each textual scope contributes to the verb entailment learning task.</p><p>6 0.57810974 <a title="126-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-An_%22AI_readability%22_Formula_for_French_as_a_Foreign_Language.html">17 emnlp-2012-An "AI readability" Formula for French as a Foreign Language</a></p>

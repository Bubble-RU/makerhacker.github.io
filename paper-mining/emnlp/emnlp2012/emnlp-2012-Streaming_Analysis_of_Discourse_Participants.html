<p>Author: Katja Filippova</p><p>Abstract: We consider the task of predicting the gender of the YouTube1 users and contrast two information sources: the comments they leave and the social environment induced from the affiliation graph of users and videos. We propagate gender information through the videos and show that a user’s gender can be predicted from her social environment with the accuracy above 90%. We also show that the gender can be predicted from language alone (89%). A surprising result of our study is that the latter predictions correlate more strongly with the gender predominant in the user’s environment than with the sex of the person as reported in the profile. We also investigate how the two views (linguistic and social) can be combined and analyse how prediction accuracy changes over different age groups.</p><p>3 0.14489378 <a title="120-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Fast_Large-Scale_Approximate_Graph_Construction_for_NLP.html">52 emnlp-2012-Fast Large-Scale Approximate Graph Construction for NLP</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Goyal ; Hal Daume III ; Raul Guerra</p><p>Abstract: Many natural language processing problems involve constructing large nearest-neighbor graphs. We propose a system called FLAG to construct such graphs approximately from large data sets. To handle the large amount of data, our algorithm maintains approximate counts based on sketching algorithms. To find the approximate nearest neighbors, our algorithm pairs a new distributed online-PMI algorithm with novel fast approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms (variants of PLEB). These algorithms return the approximate nearest neighbors quickly. We show our system’s efficiency in both intrinsic and extrinsic experiments. We further evaluate our fast search algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively on two NLP applications.</p><p>4 0.1383719 <a title="120-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Identifying_Event-related_Bursts_via_Social_Media_Activities.html">63 emnlp-2012-Identifying Event-related Bursts via Social Media Activities</a></p>
<p>Author: Xin Zhao ; Baihan Shu ; Jing Jiang ; Yang Song ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Activities on social media increase at a dramatic rate. When an external event happens, there is a surge in the degree of activities related to the event. These activities may be temporally correlated with one another, but they may also capture different aspects of an event and therefore exhibit different bursty patterns. In this paper, we propose to identify event-related bursts via social media activities. We study how to correlate multiple types of activities to derive a global bursty pattern. To model smoothness of one state sequence, we propose a novel function which can capture the state context. The experiments on a large Twitter dataset shows our methods are very effective.</p><p>5 0.11882383 <a title="120-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Sketch_Algorithms_for_Estimating_Point_Queries_in_NLP.html">117 emnlp-2012-Sketch Algorithms for Estimating Point Queries in NLP</a></p>

<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: A mixture of positive (friendly) and negative (antagonistic) relations exist among users in most social media applications. However, many such applications do not allow users to explicitly express the polarity of their interactions. As a result most research has either ignored negative links or was limited to the few domains where such relations are explicitly expressed (e.g. Epinions trust/distrust). We study text exchanged between users in online communities. We find that the polarity of the links between users can be predicted with high accuracy given the text they exchange. This allows us to build a signed network representation of discussions; where every edge has a sign: positive to denote a friendly relation, or negative to denote an antagonistic relation. We also connect our analysis to social psychology theories of balance. We show that the automatically predicted networks are consistent with those theories. Inspired by that, we present a technique for identifying subgroups in discussions by partitioning singed networks representing them.</p><p>5 0.40738282 <a title="120-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Sketch_Algorithms_for_Estimating_Point_Queries_in_NLP.html">117 emnlp-2012-Sketch Algorithms for Estimating Point Queries in NLP</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuan Zhang ; Roi Reichart ; Regina Barzilay ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method for mapping language-specific part-of-speech tags to a set of universal tags. This unified representation plays a crucial role in cross-lingual syntactic transfer of multilingual dependency parsers. Until now, however, such conversion schemes have been created manually. Our central hypothesis is that a valid mapping yields POS annotations with coherent linguistic properties which are consistent across source and target languages. We encode this intuition in an objective function that captures a range of distributional and typological characteristics of the derived mapping. Given the exponential size of the mapping space, we propose a novel method for optimizing over soft mappings, and use entropy regularization to drive those towards hard mappings. Our results demonstrate that automatically induced mappings rival the quality of their manually designed counterparts when evaluated in the . context of multilingual parsing.1</p><p>3 0.5832749 <a title="120-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Sketch_Algorithms_for_Estimating_Point_Queries_in_NLP.html">117 emnlp-2012-Sketch Algorithms for Estimating Point Queries in NLP</a></p>

<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Hal Daume III</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of building a multilingual transliteration system using an interlingual representation. Our approach uses international phonetic alphabet (IPA) to learn the interlingual representation and thus allows us to use any word and its IPA representation as a training example. Thus, our approach requires only monolingual resources: a phoneme dictionary that lists words and their IPA representations.1 By adding a phoneme dictionary of a new language, we can readily build a transliteration system into any of the existing previous languages, without the expense of all-pairs data or computation. We also propose a regularization framework for learning the interlingual representation, which accounts for language specific phonemic variability, and thus it can find better mappings between languages. Experimental results on the name transliteration task in five diverse languages show a maximum improvement of 29% accuracy and an average improvement of 17% accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art baseline system.</p><p>5 0.53365004 <a title="120-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Fast_Large-Scale_Approximate_Graph_Construction_for_NLP.html">52 emnlp-2012-Fast Large-Scale Approximate Graph Construction for NLP</a></p>

We propose a system called FLAG to construct such graphs approximately from large data sets. To handle the large amount of data, our algorithm maintains approximate counts based on sketching algorithms. To find the approximate nearest neighbors, our algorithm pairs a new distributed online-PMI algorithm with novel fast approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms (variants of PLEB). These algorithms return the approximate nearest neighbors quickly. We show our system’s efficiency in both intrinsic and extrinsic experiments. We further evaluate our fast search algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively on two NLP applications.</p><p>6 0.51804954 <a title="120-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Universal_Grapheme-to-Phoneme_Prediction_Over_Latin_Alphabets.html">132 emnlp-2012-Universal Grapheme-to-Phoneme Prediction Over Latin Alphabets</a></p>

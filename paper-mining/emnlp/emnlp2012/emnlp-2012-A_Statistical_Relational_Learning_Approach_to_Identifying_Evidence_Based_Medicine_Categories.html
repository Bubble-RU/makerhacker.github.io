<p>Author: Jayant Krishnamurthy ; Tom Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for training a semantic parser using only a knowledge base and an unlabeled text corpus, without any individually annotated sentences. Our key observation is that multiple forms ofweak supervision can be combined to train an accurate semantic parser: semantic supervision from a knowledge base, and syntactic supervision from dependencyparsed sentences. We apply our approach to train a semantic parser that uses 77 relations from Freebase in its knowledge representation. This semantic parser extracts instances of binary relations with state-of-theart accuracy, while simultaneously recovering much richer semantic structures, such as conjunctions of multiple relations with partially shared arguments. We demonstrate recovery of this richer structure by extracting logical forms from natural language queries against Freebase. On this task, the trained semantic parser achieves 80% precision and 56% recall, despite never having seen an annotated logical form.</p><p>3 0.059269603 <a title="10-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Explore_Person_Specific_Evidence_in_Web_Person_Name_Disambiguation.html">47 emnlp-2012-Explore Person Specific Evidence in Web Person Name Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Liwei Chen ; Yansong Feng ; Lei Zou ; Dongyan Zhao</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate different usages of feature representations in the web person name disambiguation task which has been suffering from the mismatch of vocabulary and lack of clues in web environments. In literature, the latter receives less attention and remains more challenging. We explore the feature space in this task and argue that collecting person specific evidences from a corpus level can provide a more reasonable and robust estimation for evaluating a feature’s importance in a given web page. This can alleviate the lack of clues where discriminative features can be reasonably weighted by taking their corpus level importance into account, not just relying on the current local context. We therefore propose a topic-based model to exploit the person specific global importance and embed it into the person name similarity. The experimental results show that the corpus level topic in- formation provides more stable evidences for discriminative features and our method outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on three WePS datasets.</p><p>4 0.053096171 <a title="10-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Inference_for_Event_Timeline_Construction.html">72 emnlp-2012-Joint Inference for Event Timeline Construction</a></p>
<p>Author: Quang Do ; Wei Lu ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the task of constructing a timeline of events mentioned in a given text. To accomplish that, we present a novel representation of the temporal structure of a news article based on time intervals. We then present an algorithmic approach that jointly optimizes the temporal structure by coupling local classifiers that predict associations and temporal relations between pairs of temporal entities with global constraints. Moreover, we present ways to leverage knowledge provided by event coreference to further improve the system performance. Overall, our experiments show that the joint inference model significantly outperformed the local classifiers by 9.2% of relative improvement in F1. The experiments also suggest that good event coreference could make remarkable contribution to a robust event timeline construction system.</p><p>5 0.052789148 <a title="10-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Transition-Based_System_for_Joint_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_and_Labeled_Non-Projective_Dependency_Parsing.html">12 emnlp-2012-A Transition-Based System for Joint Part-of-Speech Tagging and Labeled Non-Projective Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernd Bohnet ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Most current dependency parsers presuppose that input words have been morphologically disambiguated using a part-of-speech tagger before parsing begins. We present a transitionbased system for joint part-of-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with nonprojective trees. Experimental evaluation on Chinese, Czech, English and German shows consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy when compared to a pipeline system, which lead to improved state-of-theart results for all languages.</p><p>6 0.050711658 <a title="10-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Characterizing_Stylistic_Elements_in_Syntactic_Structure.html">27 emnlp-2012-Characterizing Stylistic Elements in Syntactic Structure</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Francois ; Cedrick Fairon</p><p>Abstract: This paper present a new readability formula for French as a foreign language (FFL), which relies on 46 textual features representative of the lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels as well as some of the specificities of the FFL context. We report comparisons between several techniques for feature selection and various learning algorithms. Our best model, based on support vector machines (SVM), significantly outperforms previous FFL formulas. We also found that semantic features behave poorly in our case, in contrast with some previous readability studies on English as a first language.</p><p>3 0.39304408 <a title="10-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Exploiting_Chunk-level_Features_to_Improve_Phrase_Chunking.html">45 emnlp-2012-Exploiting Chunk-level Features to Improve Phrase Chunking</a></p>
<p>Author: Junsheng Zhou ; Weiguang Qu ; Fen Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Most existing systems solved the phrase chunking task with the sequence labeling approaches, in which the chunk candidates cannot be treated as a whole during parsing process so that the chunk-level features cannot be exploited in a natural way. In this paper, we formulate phrase chunking as a joint segmentation and labeling task. We propose an efficient dynamic programming algorithm with pruning for decoding, which allows the direct use of the features describing the internal characteristics of chunk and the features capturing the correlations between adjacent chunks. A relaxed, online maximum margin training algorithm is used for learning. Within this framework, we explored a variety of effective feature representations for Chinese phrase chunking. The experimental results show that the use of chunk-level features can lead to significant performance improvement, and that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, our approach is much better at recognizing long and complicated phrases. 1</p><p>4 0.37131938 <a title="10-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Unsupervised_PCFG_Induction_for_Grounded_Language_Learning_with_Highly_Ambiguous_Supervision.html">133 emnlp-2012-Unsupervised PCFG Induction for Grounded Language Learning with Highly Ambiguous Supervision</a></p>
<p>Author: Joohyun Kim ; Raymond Mooney</p><p>Abstract: “Grounded” language learning employs training data in the form of sentences paired with relevant but ambiguous perceptual contexts. B ¨orschinger et al. (201 1) introduced an approach to grounded language learning based on unsupervised PCFG induction. Their approach works well when each sentence potentially refers to one of a small set of possible meanings, such as in the sportscasting task. However, it does not scale to problems with a large set of potential meanings for each sentence, such as the navigation instruction following task studied by Chen and Mooney (201 1). This paper presents an enhancement of the PCFG approach that scales to such problems with highly-ambiguous supervision. Experimental results on the navigation task demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>5 0.3531912 <a title="10-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Towards_Efficient_Named-Entity_Rule_Induction_for_Customizability.html">125 emnlp-2012-Towards Efficient Named-Entity Rule Induction for Customizability</a></p>
<p>Author: Ajay Nagesh ; Ganesh Ramakrishnan ; Laura Chiticariu ; Rajasekar Krishnamurthy ; Ankush Dharkar ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Generic rule-based systems for Information Extraction (IE) have been shown to work reasonably well out-of-the-box, and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with further domain customization. However, it is generally recognized that manually building and customizing rules is a complex and labor intensive process. In this paper, we discuss an approach that facilitates the process of building customizable rules for Named-Entity Recognition (NER) tasks via rule induction, in the Annotation Query Language (AQL). Given a set of basic features and an annotated document collection, our goal is to generate an initial set of rules with reasonable accuracy, that are interpretable and thus can be easily refined by a human developer. We present an efficient rule induction process, modeled on a fourstage manual rule development process and present initial promising results with our system. We also propose a simple notion of extractor complexity as a first step to quantify the interpretability of an extractor, and study the effect of induction bias and customization ofbasic features on the accuracy and complexity of induced rules. We demonstrate through experiments that the induced rules have good accuracy and low complexity according to our complexity measure.</p><p>6 0.3492758 <a title="10-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Characterizing_Stylistic_Elements_in_Syntactic_Structure.html">27 emnlp-2012-Characterizing Stylistic Elements in Syntactic Structure</a></p>

<p>Author: Katja Filippova</p><p>Abstract: We consider the task of predicting the gender of the YouTube1 users and contrast two information sources: the comments they leave and the social environment induced from the affiliation graph of users and videos. We propagate gender information through the videos and show that a user’s gender can be predicted from her social environment with the accuracy above 90%. We also show that the gender can be predicted from language alone (89%). A surprising result of our study is that the latter predictions correlate more strongly with the gender predominant in the user’s environment than with the sex of the person as reported in the profile. We also investigate how the two views (linguistic and social) can be combined and analyse how prediction accuracy changes over different age groups.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.63172311 <a title="10-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Statistical_Relational_Learning_Approach_to_Identifying_Evidence_Based_Medicine_Categories.html">10 emnlp-2012-A Statistical Relational Learning Approach to Identifying Evidence Based Medicine Categories</a></p>

<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Hal Daume III</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of building a multilingual transliteration system using an interlingual representation. Our approach uses international phonetic alphabet (IPA) to learn the interlingual representation and thus allows us to use any word and its IPA representation as a training example. Thus, our approach requires only monolingual resources: a phoneme dictionary that lists words and their IPA representations.1 By adding a phoneme dictionary of a new language, we can readily build a transliteration system into any of the existing previous languages, without the expense of all-pairs data or computation. We also propose a regularization framework for learning the interlingual representation, which accounts for language specific phonemic variability, and thus it can find better mappings between languages. Experimental results on the name transliteration task in five diverse languages show a maximum improvement of 29% accuracy and an average improvement of 17% accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art baseline system.</p><p>4 0.29652193 <a title="10-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Semantic_Compositionality_through_Recursive_Matrix-Vector_Spaces.html">116 emnlp-2012-Semantic Compositionality through Recursive Matrix-Vector Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Brody Huval ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Single-word vector space models have been very successful at learning lexical information. However, they cannot capture the compositional meaning of longer phrases, preventing them from a deeper understanding of language. We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between nouns using the syntactic path between them.</p><p>5 0.29527625 <a title="10-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Using_Discourse_Information_for_Paraphrase_Extraction.html">135 emnlp-2012-Using Discourse Information for Paraphrase Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Michaela Regneri ; Rui Wang</p><p>Abstract: Previous work on paraphrase extraction using parallel or comparable corpora has generally not considered the documents’ discourse structure as a useful information source. We propose a novel method for collecting paraphrases relying on the sequential event order in the discourse, using multiple sequence alignment with a semantic similarity measure. We show that adding discourse information boosts the performance of sentence-level paraphrase acquisition, which consequently gives a tremendous advantage for extracting phraselevel paraphrase fragments from matched sentences. Our system beats an informed baseline by a margin of 50%.</p><p>6 0.29450777 <a title="10-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Concurrent_Acquisition_of_Word_Meaning_and_Lexical_Categories.html">29 emnlp-2012-Concurrent Acquisition of Word Meaning and Lexical Categories</a></p>

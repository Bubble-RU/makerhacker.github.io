<p>Author: Graham Neubig ; Taro Watanabe ; Shinsuke Mori</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for learning a discriminative parser for machine translation reordering using only aligned parallel text. This is done by treating the parserâ€™s derivation tree as a latent variable in a model that is trained to maximize reordering accuracy. We demonstrate that efficient large-margin training is possible by showing that two measures of reordering accuracy can be factored over the parse tree. Using this model in the pre-ordering framework results in significant gains in translation accuracy over standard phrasebased SMT and previously proposed unsupervised syntax induction methods.</p><p>3 0.21801119 <a title="31-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Forced_Derivation_Tree_based_Model_Training_to_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">54 emnlp-2012-Forced Derivation Tree based Model Training to Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

In this paper, we present an approach that leverages structured knowledge contained in FDTs to train component models for statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. We first describe how to generate different FDTs for each sentence pair in training corpus, and then present how to infer the optimal FDTs based on their derivation and alignment qualities. As the first step in this line of research, we verify the effectiveness of our approach in a BTGbased phrasal system, and propose four FDTbased component models. Experiments are carried out on large scale English-to-Japanese and Chinese-to-English translation tasks, and significant improvements are reported on both translation quality and alignment quality.</p><p>4 0.13558199 <a title="31-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Entropy-based_Pruning_for_Phrase-based_Machine_Translation.html">42 emnlp-2012-Entropy-based Pruning for Phrase-based Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Wang Ling ; Joao Graca ; Isabel Trancoso ; Alan Black</p><p>Abstract: Phrase-based machine translation models have shown to yield better translations than Word-based models, since phrase pairs encode the contextual information that is needed for a more accurate translation. However, many phrase pairs do not encode any relevant context, which means that the translation event encoded in that phrase pair is led by smaller translation events that are independent from each other, and can be found on smaller phrase pairs, with little or no loss in translation accuracy. In this work, we propose a relative entropy model for translation models, that measures how likely a phrase pair encodes a translation event that is derivable using smaller translation events with similar probabilities. This model is then applied to phrase table pruning. Tests show that considerable amounts of phrase pairs can be excluded, without much impact on the transla- . tion quality. In fact, we show that better translations can be obtained using our pruned models, due to the compression of the search space during decoding.</p><p>5 0.10746378 <a title="31-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Systematic_Comparison_of_Phrase_Table_Pruning_Techniques.html">11 emnlp-2012-A Systematic Comparison of Phrase Table Pruning Techniques</a></p>

In this paper, we introduce a novel pruning criterion that places phrase table pruning on a sound theoretical foundation. Systematic experiments on four language pairs under various data conditions show that our principled approach is superior to existing ad hoc pruning methods.</p><p>6 0.09579888 <a title="31-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Document-Wide_Decoding_for_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">35 emnlp-2012-Document-Wide Decoding for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Vera Demberg ; Asad Sayeed ; Philip Gorinski ; Nikolaos Engonopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present results of a novel experiment to investigate speech production in conversational data that links speech rate to information density. We provide the first evidence for an association between syntactic surprisal and word duration in recorded speech. Using the AMI corpus which contains transcriptions of focus group meetings with precise word durations, we show that word durations correlate with syntactic surprisal estimated from the incremental Roark parser over and above simpler measures, such as word duration estimated from a state-of-the-art text-to-speech system and word frequencies, and that the syntactic surprisal estimates are better predictors of word durations than a simpler version of surprisal based on trigram probabilities. This result supports the uniform information density (UID) hypothesis and points a way to more realistic artificial speech generation.</p><p>5 0.257945 <a title="31-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Exploiting_Chunk-level_Features_to_Improve_Phrase_Chunking.html">45 emnlp-2012-Exploiting Chunk-level Features to Improve Phrase Chunking</a></p>
<p>Author: Junsheng Zhou ; Weiguang Qu ; Fen Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Most existing systems solved the phrase chunking task with the sequence labeling approaches, in which the chunk candidates cannot be treated as a whole during parsing process so that the chunk-level features cannot be exploited in a natural way. In this paper, we formulate phrase chunking as a joint segmentation and labeling task. We propose an efficient dynamic programming algorithm with pruning for decoding, which allows the direct use of the features describing the internal characteristics of chunk and the features capturing the correlations between adjacent chunks. A relaxed, online maximum margin training algorithm is used for learning. Within this framework, we explored a variety of effective feature representations for Chinese phrase chunking. The experimental results show that the use of chunk-level features can lead to significant performance improvement, and that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, our approach is much better at recognizing long and complicated phrases. 1</p><p>6 0.25482079 <a title="31-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Entropy-based_Pruning_for_Phrase-based_Machine_Translation.html">42 emnlp-2012-Entropy-based Pruning for Phrase-based Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Shen Li ; Joao Graca ; Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: Despite significant recent work, purely unsupervised techniques for part-of-speech (POS) tagging have not achieved useful accuracies required by many language processing tasks. Use of parallel text between resource-rich and resource-poor languages is one source ofweak supervision that significantly improves accuracy. However, parallel text is not always available and techniques for using it require multiple complex algorithmic steps. In this paper we show that we can build POS-taggers exceeding state-of-the-art bilingual methods by using simple hidden Markov models and a freely available and naturally growing resource, the Wiktionary. Across eight languages for which we have labeled data to evaluate results, we achieve accuracy that significantly exceeds best unsupervised and parallel text methods. We achieve highest accuracy reported for several languages and show that our . approach yields better out-of-domain taggers than those trained using fully supervised Penn Treebank.</p><p>3 0.25789303 <a title="31-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Probabilistic_Finite_State_Machines_for_Regression-based_MT_Evaluation.html">108 emnlp-2012-Probabilistic Finite State Machines for Regression-based MT Evaluation</a></p>
<p>Author: Mengqiu Wang ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Accurate and robust metrics for automatic evaluation are key to the development of statistical machine translation (MT) systems. We first introduce a new regression model that uses a probabilistic finite state machine (pFSM) to compute weighted edit distance as predictions of translation quality. We also propose a novel pushdown automaton extension of the pFSM model for modeling word swapping and cross alignments that cannot be captured by standard edit distance models. Our models can easily incorporate a rich set of linguistic features, and automatically learn their weights, eliminating the need for ad-hoc parameter tuning. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art correlation with human judgments on two different prediction tasks across a diverse set of standard evaluations (NIST OpenMT06,08; WMT0608).</p><p>4 0.25749555 <a title="31-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Aligning_Predicates_across_Monolingual_Comparable_Texts_using_Graph-based_Clustering.html">16 emnlp-2012-Aligning Predicates across Monolingual Comparable Texts using Graph-based Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Roth ; Anette Frank</p><p>Abstract: Generating coherent discourse is an important aspect in natural language generation. Our aim is to learn factors that constitute coherent discourse from data, with a focus on how to realize predicate-argument structures in a model that exceeds the sentence level. We present an important subtask for this overall goal, in which we align predicates across comparable texts, admitting partial argument structure correspondence. The contribution of this work is two-fold: We first construct a large corpus resource of comparable texts, including an evaluation set with manual predicate alignments. Secondly, we present a novel approach for aligning predicates across comparable texts using graph-based clustering with Mincuts. Our method significantly outperforms other alignment techniques when applied to this novel alignment task, by a margin of at least 6.5 percentage points in F1-score.</p><p>5 0.25630027 <a title="31-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Inducing_a_Discriminative_Parser_to_Optimize_Machine_Translation_Reordering.html">67 emnlp-2012-Inducing a Discriminative Parser to Optimize Machine Translation Reordering</a></p>
<p>Author: Graham Neubig ; Taro Watanabe ; Shinsuke Mori</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for learning a discriminative parser for machine translation reordering using only aligned parallel text. This is done by treating the parserâ€™s derivation tree as a latent variable in a model that is trained to maximize reordering accuracy. We demonstrate that efficient large-margin training is possible by showing that two measures of reordering accuracy can be factored over the parse tree. Using this model in the pre-ordering framework results in significant gains in translation accuracy over standard phrasebased SMT and previously proposed unsupervised syntax induction methods.</p><p>6 0.25625953 <a title="31-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Unified_Approach_to_Transliteration-based_Text_Input_with_Online_Spelling_Correction.html">13 emnlp-2012-A Unified Approach to Transliteration-based Text Input with Online Spelling Correction</a></p>

<p>Author: Quang Do ; Wei Lu ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the task of constructing a timeline of events mentioned in a given text. To accomplish that, we present a novel representation of the temporal structure of a news article based on time intervals. We then present an algorithmic approach that jointly optimizes the temporal structure by coupling local classifiers that predict associations and temporal relations between pairs of temporal entities with global constraints. Moreover, we present ways to leverage knowledge provided by event coreference to further improve the system performance. Overall, our experiments show that the joint inference model significantly outperformed the local classifiers by 9.2% of relative improvement in F1. The experiments also suggest that good event coreference could make remarkable contribution to a robust event timeline construction system.</p><p>3 0.1157717 <a title="77-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Discovering_Diverse_and_Salient_Threads_in_Document_Collections.html">33 emnlp-2012-Discovering Diverse and Salient Threads in Document Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Gillenwater ; Alex Kulesza ; Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic technique for modeling and extracting salient structure from large document collections. As in clustering and topic modeling, our goal is to provide an organizing perspective into otherwise overwhelming amounts of information. We are particularly interested in revealing and exploiting relationships between documents. To this end, we focus on extracting diverse sets of threads—singlylinked, coherent chains of important documents. To illustrate, we extract research threads from citation graphs and construct timelines from news articles. Our method is highly scalable, running on a corpus of over 30 million words in about four minutes, more than 75 times faster than a dynamic topic model.

<p>Author: Xian-Ling Mao ; Zhao-Yan Ming ; Tat-Seng Chua ; Si Li ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Supervised hierarchical topic modeling and unsupervised hierarchical topic modeling are usually used to obtain hierarchical topics, such as hLLDA and hLDA. Supervised hierarchical topic modeling makes heavy use of the information from observed hierarchical labels, but cannot explore new topics; while unsupervised hierarchical topic modeling is able to detect automatically new topics in the data space, but does not make use of any information from hierarchical labels. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised hierarchical topic model which aims to explore new topics automatically in the data space while incorporating the information from observed hierarchical labels into the modeling process, called SemiSupervised Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SSHLDA). We also prove that hLDA and hLLDA are special cases of SSHLDA. We . conduct experiments on Yahoo! Answers and ODP datasets, and assess the performance in terms of perplexity and clustering. The experimental results show that predictive ability of SSHLDA is better than that of baselines, and SSHLDA can also achieve significant improvement over baselines for clustering on the FScore measure.</p><p>3 0.5948953 <a title="77-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Entity_and_Event_Coreference_Resolution_across_Documents.html">71 emnlp-2012-Joint Entity and Event Coreference Resolution across Documents</a></p>
<p>Author: Heeyoung Lee ; Marta Recasens ; Angel Chang ; Mihai Surdeanu ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel coreference resolution system that models entities and events jointly. Our iterative method cautiously constructs clusters of entity and event mentions using linear regression to model cluster merge operations. As clusters are built, information flows between entity and event clusters through features that model semantic role dependencies. Our system handles nominal and verbal events as well as entities, and our joint formulation allows information from event coreference to help entity coreference, and vice versa. In a cross-document domain with comparable documents, joint coreference resolution performs significantly better (over 3 CoNLL F1 points) than two strong baselines that resolve entities and events separately.</p><p>4 0.3978526 <a title="77-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Detecting_Subgroups_in_Online_Discussions_by_Modeling_Positive_and_Negative_Relations_among_Participants.html">32 emnlp-2012-Detecting Subgroups in Online Discussions by Modeling Positive and Negative Relations among Participants</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: A mixture of positive (friendly) and negative (antagonistic) relations exist among users in most social media applications. However, many such applications do not allow users to explicitly express the polarity of their interactions. As a result most research has either ignored negative links or was limited to the few domains where such relations are explicitly expressed (e.g. Epinions trust/distrust). We study text exchanged between users in online communities. We find that the polarity of the links between users can be predicted with high accuracy given the text they exchange. This allows us to build a signed network representation of discussions; where every edge has a sign: positive to denote a friendly relation, or negative to denote an antagonistic relation. We also connect our analysis to social psychology theories of balance. We show that the automatically predicted networks are consistent with those theories. Inspired by that, we present a technique for identifying subgroups in discussions by partitioning singed networks representing them.</p><p>5 0.39693207 <a title="77-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Assessment_of_ESL_Learners%27_Syntactic_Competence_Based_on_Similarity_Measures.html">21 emnlp-2012-Assessment of ESL Learners' Syntactic Competence Based on Similarity Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Su-Youn Yoon ; Suma Bhat</p><p>Abstract: This study presents a novel method that measures English language learners’ syntactic competence towards improving automated speech scoring systems. In contrast to most previous studies which focus on the length of production units such as the mean length of clauses, we focused on capturing the differences in the distribution of morpho-syntactic features or grammatical expressions across proficiency. We estimated the syntactic competence through the use of corpus-based NLP techniques. Assuming that the range and so- phistication of grammatical expressions can be captured by the distribution of Part-ofSpeech (POS) tags, vector space models of POS tags were constructed. We use a large corpus of English learners’ responses that are classified into four proficiency levels by human raters. Our proposed feature measures the similarity of a given response with the most proficient group and is then estimates the learner’s syntactic competence level. Widely outperforming the state-of-the-art measures of syntactic complexity, our method attained a significant correlation with humanrated scores. The correlation between humanrated scores and features based on manual transcription was 0.43 and the same based on ASR-hypothesis was slightly lower, 0.42. An important advantage of our method is its robustness against speech recognition errors not to mention the simplicity of feature generation that captures a reasonable set of learnerspecific syntactic errors. 600 Measures Suma Bhat Beckman Institute, Urbana, IL 61801 . spbhat 2 @ i l l ino i edu s</p><p>6 0.39675769 <a title="77-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Automatically_Constructing_a_Normalisation_Dictionary_for_Microblogs.html">22 emnlp-2012-Automatically Constructing a Normalisation Dictionary for Microblogs</a></p>

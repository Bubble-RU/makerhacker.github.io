<p>Author: Graham Neubig ; Taro Watanabe ; Shinsuke Mori</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for learning a discriminative parser for machine translation reordering using only aligned parallel text. This is done by treating the parser’s derivation tree as a latent variable in a model that is trained to maximize reordering accuracy. We demonstrate that efficient large-margin training is possible by showing that two measures of reordering accuracy can be factored over the parse tree. Using this model in the pre-ordering framework results in significant gains in translation accuracy over standard phrasebased SMT and previously proposed unsupervised syntax induction methods.</p><p>3 0.10812019 <a title="45-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Chinese_Word_Segmentation%2C_POS_Tagging_and_Parsing.html">70 emnlp-2012-Joint Chinese Word Segmentation, POS Tagging and Parsing</a></p>

Previous work often used a pipeline method Chinese word segmentation followed by POS tagging and parsing, which suffers from error propagation and is unable to leverage information in later modules for earlier components. In our approach, we train the three individual models separately during training, and incorporate them together in a unified framework during decoding. We extend the CYK parsing algorithm so that it can deal with word segmentation and POS tagging features. As far as we know, this is the first work on joint Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing.

<p>Author: Jiayi Zhao ; Xipeng Qiu ; Shu Zhang ; Feng Ji ; Xuanjing Huang</p><p>Abstract: In modern Chinese articles or conversations, it is very popular to involve a few English words, especially in emails and Internet literature. Therefore, it becomes an important and challenging topic to analyze Chinese-English mixed texts. The underlying problem is how to tag part-of-speech (POS) for the English words involved. Due to the lack of specially annotated corpus, most of the English words are tagged as the oversimplified type, “foreign words”. In this paper, we present a method using dynamic features to tag POS of mixed texts. Experiments show that our method achieves higher performance than traditional sequence labeling methods. Meanwhile, our method also boosts the performance of POS tagging for pure Chinese texts.</p><p>6 0.076806813 <a title="45-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Unified_Dependency_Parsing_of_Chinese_Morphological_and_Syntactic_Structures.html">131 emnlp-2012-Unified Dependency Parsing of Chinese Morphological and Syntactic Structures</a></p>

<p>Author: Mathias Verbeke ; Vincent Van Asch ; Roser Morante ; Paolo Frasconi ; Walter Daelemans ; Luc De Raedt</p><p>Abstract: Evidence-based medicine is an approach whereby clinical decisions are supported by the best available findings gained from scientific research. This requires efficient access to such evidence. To this end, abstracts in evidence-based medicine can be labeled using a set of predefined medical categories, the socalled PICO criteria. This paper presents an approach to automatically annotate sentences in medical abstracts with these labels. Since both structural and sequential information are important for this classification task, we use kLog, a new language for statistical relational learning with kernels. Our results show a clear improvement with respect to state-of-the-art systems.</p><p>4 0.34308225 <a title="45-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Inducing_a_Discriminative_Parser_to_Optimize_Machine_Translation_Reordering.html">67 emnlp-2012-Inducing a Discriminative Parser to Optimize Machine Translation Reordering</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexander Rush ; Roi Reichart ; Michael Collins ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art statistical parsers and POS taggers perform very well when trained with large amounts of in-domain data. When training data is out-of-domain or limited, accuracy degrades. In this paper, we aim to compensate for the lack of available training data by exploiting similarities between test set sentences. We show how to augment sentencelevel models for parsing and POS tagging with inter-sentence consistency constraints. To deal with the resulting global objective, we present an efficient and exact dual decomposition decoding algorithm. In experiments, we add consistency constraints to the MST parser and the Stanford part-of-speech tagger and demonstrate significant error reduction in the domain adaptation and the lightly supervised settings across five languages.</p><p>4 0.55492258 <a title="45-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Iterative_Annotation_Transformation_with_Predict-Self_Reestimation_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation.html">68 emnlp-2012-Iterative Annotation Transformation with Predict-Self Reestimation for Chinese Word Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenbin Jiang ; Fandong Meng ; Qun Liu ; Yajuan Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we first describe the technology of automatic annotation transformation, which is based on the annotation adaptation algorithm (Jiang et al., 2009). It can automatically transform a human-annotated corpus from one annotation guideline to another. We then propose two optimization strategies, iterative training and predict-selfreestimation, to further improve the accuracy of annotation guideline transformation. Experiments on Chinese word segmentation show that, the iterative training strategy together with predictself reestimation brings significant improvement over the simple annotation transformation baseline, and leads to classifiers with significantly higher accuracy and several times faster processing than annotation adaptation does. On the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0, , it achieves an F-measure of 98.43%, significantly outperforms previous works although using a single classifier with only local features.</p><p>5 0.55355579 <a title="45-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Extracting_Opinion_Expressions_with_semi-Markov_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">51 emnlp-2012-Extracting Opinion Expressions with semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Bishan Yang ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: Extracting opinion expressions from text is usually formulated as a token-level sequence labeling task tackled using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). CRFs, however, do not readily model potentially useful segment-level information like syntactic constituent structure. Thus, we propose a semi-CRF-based approach to the task that can perform sequence labeling at the segment level. We extend the original semi-CRF model (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004) to allow the modeling of arbitrarily long expressions while accounting for their likely syntactic structure when modeling segment boundaries. We evaluate performance on two opinion extraction tasks, and, in contrast to previous sequence labeling approaches to the task, explore the usefulness of segment- level syntactic parse features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both opinion expression tasks.</p><p>6 0.54615563 <a title="45-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Besting_the_Quiz_Master%3A_Crowdsourcing_Incremental_Classification_Games.html">23 emnlp-2012-Besting the Quiz Master: Crowdsourcing Incremental Classification Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Yang Song ; Jing Jiang ; Wayne Xin Zhao ; Sujian Li ; Houfeng Wang</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise coreference resolution models must merge pairwise coreference decisions to generate final outputs. Traditional merging methods adopt different strategies such as the bestfirst method and enforcing the transitivity constraint, but most of these methods are used independently of the pairwise learning methods as an isolated inference procedure at the end. We propose a joint learning model which combines pairwise classification and mention clustering with Markov logic. Experimental results show that our joint learning system outperforms independent learning systems. Our system gives a better performance than all the learning-based systems from the CoNLL-201 1shared task on the same dataset. Compared with the best system from CoNLL2011, which employs a rule-based method, our system shows competitive performance.</p><p>3 0.38637593 <a title="71-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning-based_Multi-Sieve_Co-reference_Resolution_with_Knowledge.html">76 emnlp-2012-Learning-based Multi-Sieve Co-reference Resolution with Knowledge</a></p>
<p>Author: Lev Ratinov ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We explore the interplay of knowledge and structure in co-reference resolution. To inject knowledge, we use a state-of-the-art system which cross-links (or “grounds”) expressions in free text to Wikipedia. We explore ways of using the resulting grounding to boost the performance of a state-of-the-art co-reference resolution system. To maximize the utility of the injected knowledge, we deploy a learningbased multi-sieve approach and develop novel entity-based features. Our end system outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 2 B3 F1 points on non-transcript portion of the ACE 2004 dataset.</p><p>4 0.26911917 <a title="71-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Resolving_Complex_Cases_of_Definite_Pronouns%3A_The_Winograd_Schema_Challenge.html">112 emnlp-2012-Resolving Complex Cases of Definite Pronouns: The Winograd Schema Challenge</a></p>
<p>Author: Altaf Rahman ; Vincent Ng</p><p>Abstract: We examine the task of resolving complex cases of definite pronouns, specifically those for which traditional linguistic constraints on coreference (e.g., Binding Constraints, gender and number agreement) as well as commonly-used resolution heuristics (e.g., string-matching facilities, syntactic salience) are not useful. Being able to solve this task has broader implications in artificial intelligence: a restricted version of it, sometimes referred to as the Winograd Schema Challenge, has been suggested as a conceptually and practically appealing alternative to the Turing Test. We employ a knowledge-rich approach to this task, which yields a pronoun resolver that outperforms state-of-the-art resolvers by nearly 18 points in accuracy on our dataset.</p><p>5 0.24459285 <a title="71-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Inference_for_Event_Timeline_Construction.html">72 emnlp-2012-Joint Inference for Event Timeline Construction</a></p>

<p>Author: Jian Bo Yang ; Qi Mao ; Qiao Liang Xiang ; Ivor Wai-Hung Tsang ; Kian Ming Adam Chai ; Hai Leong Chieu</p><p>Abstract: We propose an adaptive ensemble method to adapt coreference resolution across domains. This method has three features: (1) it can optimize for any user-specified objective measure; (2) it can make document-specific prediction rather than rely on a fixed base model or a fixed set of base models; (3) it can automatically adjust the active ensemble members during prediction. With simplification, this method can be used in the traditional withindomain case, while still retaining the above features. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to both (i) develop a domain adaptation algorithm for the coreference resolution problem and (ii) have the above features as an ensemble method. Empirically, we show the benefits of (i) on the six domains of the ACE 2005 data set in domain adaptation set- ting, and of (ii) on both the MUC-6 and the ACE 2005 data sets in within-domain setting.</p><p>6 0.47774151 <a title="71-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Resolving_Complex_Cases_of_Definite_Pronouns%3A_The_Winograd_Schema_Challenge.html">112 emnlp-2012-Resolving Complex Cases of Definite Pronouns: The Winograd Schema Challenge</a></p>

<p>Author: David McClosky ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We present a distantly supervised system for extracting the temporal bounds of fluents (relations which only hold during certain times, such as attends school). Unlike previous pipelined approaches, our model does not assume independence between each fluent or even between named entities with known connections (parent, spouse, employer, etc.). Instead, we model what makes timelines of fluents consistent by learning cross-fluent constraints, potentially spanning entities as well. For example, our model learns that someone is unlikely to start a job at age two or to marry someone who hasn’t been born yet. Our system achieves a 36% error reduction over a pipelined baseline.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.6915223 <a title="71-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Entity_and_Event_Coreference_Resolution_across_Documents.html">71 emnlp-2012-Joint Entity and Event Coreference Resolution across Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Xian-Ling Mao ; Zhao-Yan Ming ; Tat-Seng Chua ; Si Li ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Supervised hierarchical topic modeling and unsupervised hierarchical topic modeling are usually used to obtain hierarchical topics, such as hLLDA and hLDA. Supervised hierarchical topic modeling makes heavy use of the information from observed hierarchical labels, but cannot explore new topics; while unsupervised hierarchical topic modeling is able to detect automatically new topics in the data space, but does not make use of any information from hierarchical labels. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised hierarchical topic model which aims to explore new topics automatically in the data space while incorporating the information from observed hierarchical labels into the modeling process, called SemiSupervised Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SSHLDA). We also prove that hLDA and hLLDA are special cases of SSHLDA. We . conduct experiments on Yahoo! Answers and ODP datasets, and assess the performance in terms of perplexity and clustering. The experimental results show that predictive ability of SSHLDA is better than that of baselines, and SSHLDA can also achieve significant improvement over baselines for clustering on the FScore measure.</p><p>4 0.47589609 <a title="71-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Inference_for_Event_Timeline_Construction.html">72 emnlp-2012-Joint Inference for Event Timeline Construction</a></p>

Moreover, we present ways to leverage knowledge provided by event coreference to further improve the system performance. Overall, our experiments show that the joint inference model significantly outperformed the local classifiers by 9.2% of relative improvement in F1. The experiments also suggest that good event coreference could make remarkable contribution to a robust event timeline construction system.</p><p>5 0.473667 <a title="71-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning-based_Multi-Sieve_Co-reference_Resolution_with_Knowledge.html">76 emnlp-2012-Learning-based Multi-Sieve Co-reference Resolution with Knowledge</a></p>
<p>Author: Lev Ratinov ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We explore the interplay of knowledge and structure in co-reference resolution. To inject knowledge, we use a state-of-the-art system which cross-links (or “grounds”) expressions in free text to Wikipedia. We explore ways of using the resulting grounding to boost the performance of a state-of-the-art co-reference resolution system. To maximize the utility of the injected knowledge, we deploy a learningbased multi-sieve approach and develop novel entity-based features. Our end system outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 2 B3 F1 points on non-transcript portion of the ACE 2004 dataset.</p><p>6 0.46927783 <a title="71-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Using_Discourse_Information_for_Paraphrase_Extraction.html">135 emnlp-2012-Using Discourse Information for Paraphrase Extraction</a></p>

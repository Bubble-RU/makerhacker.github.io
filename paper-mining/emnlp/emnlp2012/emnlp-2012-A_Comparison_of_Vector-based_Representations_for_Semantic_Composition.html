<p>Author: Carina Silberer ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: A popular tradition of studying semantic representation has been driven by the assumption that word meaning can be learned from the linguistic environment, despite ample evidence suggesting that language is grounded in perception and action. In this paper we present a comparative study of models that represent word meaning based on linguistic and perceptual data. Linguistic information is approximated by naturally occurring corpora and sensorimotor experience by feature norms (i.e., attributes native speakers consider important in describing the meaning of a word). The models differ in terms of the mechanisms by which they integrate the two modalities. Experimental results show that a closer correspondence to human data can be obtained by uncovering latent information shared among the textual and perceptual modalities rather than arriving at semantic knowledge by concatenating the two.</p><p>6 0.39482778 <a title="4-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Polarity_Inducing_Latent_Semantic_Analysis.html">107 emnlp-2012-Polarity Inducing Latent Semantic Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Lan Du ; Wray Buntine ; Huidong Jin</p><p>Abstract: Topic models are increasingly being used for text analysis tasks, often times replacing earlier semantic techniques such as latent semantic analysis. In this paper, we develop a novel adaptive topic model with the ability to adapt topics from both the previous segment and the parent document. For this proposed model, a Gibbs sampler is developed for doing posterior inference. Experimental results show that with topic adaptation, our model significantly improves over existing approaches in terms of perplexity, and is able to uncover clear sequential structure on, for example, Herman Melville’s book “Moby Dick”.</p><p>3 0.60421479 <a title="4-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Forest_Reranking_through_Subtree_Ranking.html">55 emnlp-2012-Forest Reranking through Subtree Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Farkas ; Helmut Schmid</p><p>Abstract: We propose the subtree ranking approach to parse forest reranking which is a generalization of current perceptron-based reranking methods. For the training of the reranker, we extract competing local subtrees, hence the training instances (candidate subtree sets) are very similar to those used during beamsearch parsing. This leads to better parameter optimization. Another chief advantage of the framework is that arbitrary learning to rank methods can be applied. We evaluated our reranking approach on German and English phrase structure parsing tasks and compared it to various state-of-the-art reranking approaches such as the perceptron-based forest reranker. The subtree ranking approach with a Maximum Entropy model significantly outperformed the other approaches.</p><p>4 0.47609261 <a title="4-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Semantic_Compositionality_through_Recursive_Matrix-Vector_Spaces.html">116 emnlp-2012-Semantic Compositionality through Recursive Matrix-Vector Spaces</a></p>

<p>Author: Gemma Boleda ; Eva Maria Vecchi ; Miquel Cornudella ; Louise McNally</p><p>Abstract: Adjectival modification, particularly by expressions that have been treated as higherorder modifiers in the formal semantics tradition, raises interesting challenges for semantic composition in distributional semantic models. We contrast three types of adjectival modifiers intersectively used color terms (as in white towel, clearly first-order), subsectively used color terms (white wine, which have been modeled as both first- and higher-order), and intensional adjectives (former bassist, clearly higher-order) and test the ability of different composition strategies to model their behavior. In addition to opening up a new empirical domain for research on distributional semantics, our observations concerning the attested vectors for the different types of adjectives, the nouns they modify, and the resulting – – noun phrases yield insights into modification that have been little evident in the formal semantics literature to date.</p><p>6 0.46465072 <a title="4-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Resolving_Complex_Cases_of_Definite_Pronouns%3A_The_Winograd_Schema_Challenge.html">112 emnlp-2012-Resolving Complex Cases of Definite Pronouns: The Winograd Schema Challenge</a></p>

<p>Author: David McClosky ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We present a distantly supervised system for extracting the temporal bounds of fluents (relations which only hold during certain times, such as attends school). Unlike previous pipelined approaches, our model does not assume independence between each fluent or even between named entities with known connections (parent, spouse, employer, etc.). Instead, we model what makes timelines of fluents consistent by learning cross-fluent constraints, potentially spanning entities as well. For example, our model learns that someone is unlikely to start a job at age two or to marry someone who hasn’t been born yet. Our system achieves a 36% error reduction over a pipelined baseline.</p><p>3 0.24879092 <a title="72-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Learning_for_Coreference_Resolution_with_Markov_Logic.html">73 emnlp-2012-Joint Learning for Coreference Resolution with Markov Logic</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Song ; Jing Jiang ; Wayne Xin Zhao ; Sujian Li ; Houfeng Wang</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise coreference resolution models must merge pairwise coreference decisions to generate final outputs. Traditional merging methods adopt different strategies such as the bestfirst method and enforcing the transitivity constraint, but most of these methods are used independently of the pairwise learning methods as an isolated inference procedure at the end. We propose a joint learning model which combines pairwise classification and mention clustering with Markov logic. Experimental results show that our joint learning system outperforms independent learning systems. Our system gives a better performance than all the learning-based systems from the CoNLL-201 1shared task on the same dataset. Compared with the best system from CoNLL2011, which employs a rule-based method, our system shows competitive performance.</p><p>4 0.24459285 <a title="72-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Entity_and_Event_Coreference_Resolution_across_Documents.html">71 emnlp-2012-Joint Entity and Event Coreference Resolution across Documents</a></p>
<p>Author: Heeyoung Lee ; Marta Recasens ; Angel Chang ; Mihai Surdeanu ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel coreference resolution system that models entities and events jointly. Our iterative method cautiously constructs clusters of entity and event mentions using linear regression to model cluster merge operations. As clusters are built, information flows between entity and event clusters through features that model semantic role dependencies. Our system handles nominal and verbal events as well as entities, and our joint formulation allows information from event coreference to help entity coreference, and vice versa. In a cross-document domain with comparable documents, joint coreference resolution performs significantly better (over 3 CoNLL F1 points) than two strong baselines that resolve entities and events separately.</p><p>5 0.13803917 <a title="72-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Discovering_Diverse_and_Salient_Threads_in_Document_Collections.html">33 emnlp-2012-Discovering Diverse and Salient Threads in Document Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Gillenwater ; Alex Kulesza ; Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic technique for modeling and extracting salient structure from large document collections. As in clustering and topic modeling, our goal is to provide an organizing perspective into otherwise overwhelming amounts of information. We are particularly interested in revealing and exploiting relationships between documents. To this end, we focus on extracting diverse sets of threads—singlylinked, coherent chains of important documents. To illustrate, we extract research threads from citation graphs and construct timelines from news articles. Our method is highly scalable, running on a corpus of over 30 million words in about four minutes, more than 75 times faster than a dynamic topic model.

<p>Author: Michaela Regneri ; Rui Wang</p><p>Abstract: Previous work on paraphrase extraction using parallel or comparable corpora has generally not considered the documents’ discourse structure as a useful information source. We propose a novel method for collecting paraphrases relying on the sequential event order in the discourse, using multiple sequence alignment with a semantic similarity measure. We show that adding discourse information boosts the performance of sentence-level paraphrase acquisition, which consequently gives a tremendous advantage for extracting phraselevel paraphrase fragments from matched sentences. Our system beats an informed baseline by a margin of 50%.</p><p>4 0.51230824 <a title="72-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Linking_Named_Entities_to_Any_Database.html">84 emnlp-2012-Linking Named Entities to Any Database</a></p>
<p>Author: Avirup Sil ; Ernest Cronin ; Penghai Nie ; Yinfei Yang ; Ana-Maria Popescu ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Existing techniques for disambiguating named entities in text mostly focus on Wikipedia as a target catalog of entities. Yet for many types of entities, such as restaurants and cult movies, relational databases exist that contain far more extensive information than Wikipedia. This paper introduces a new task, called Open-Database Named-Entity Disambiguation (Open-DB NED), in which a system must be able to resolve named entities to symbols in an arbitrary database, without requiring labeled data for each new database. We introduce two techniques for Open-DB NED, one based on distant supervision and the other based on domain adaptation. In experiments on two domains, one with poor coverage by Wikipedia and the other with near-perfect coverage, our Open-DB NED strategies outperform a state-of-the-art Wikipedia NED system by over 25% in accuracy.</p><p>5 0.50445271 <a title="72-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Multi-instance_Multi-label_Learning_for_Relation_Extraction.html">93 emnlp-2012-Multi-instance Multi-label Learning for Relation Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Mihai Surdeanu ; Julie Tibshirani ; Ramesh Nallapati ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Distant supervision for relation extraction (RE) gathering training data by aligning a database of facts with text – is an efficient approach to scale RE to thousands of different relations. However, this introduces a challenging learning scenario where the relation expressed by a pair of entities found in a sentence is unknown. For example, a sentence containing Balzac and France may express BornIn or Died, an unknown relation, or no relation at all. Because of this, traditional supervised learning, which assumes that each example is explicitly mapped to a label, is not appropriate. We propose a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for RE, which jointly models all the instances of a pair of entities in text and all their labels using a graphical model with latent variables. Our model performs competitively on two difficult domains. –</p><p>6 0.49831218 <a title="72-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Entity_and_Event_Coreference_Resolution_across_Documents.html">71 emnlp-2012-Joint Entity and Event Coreference Resolution across Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiayi Zhao ; Xipeng Qiu ; Shu Zhang ; Feng Ji ; Xuanjing Huang</p><p>Abstract: In modern Chinese articles or conversations, it is very popular to involve a few English words, especially in emails and Internet literature. Therefore, it becomes an important and challenging topic to analyze Chinese-English mixed texts. The underlying problem is how to tag part-of-speech (POS) for the English words involved. Due to the lack of specially annotated corpus, most of the English words are tagged as the oversimplified type, “foreign words”. In this paper, we present a method using dynamic features to tag POS of mixed texts. Experiments show that our method achieves higher performance than traditional sequence labeling methods. Meanwhile, our method also boosts the performance of POS tagging for pure Chinese texts.</p><p>3 0.37099743 <a title="70-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Unified_Dependency_Parsing_of_Chinese_Morphological_and_Syntactic_Structures.html">131 emnlp-2012-Unified Dependency Parsing of Chinese Morphological and Syntactic Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongguo Li ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Most previous approaches to syntactic parsing of Chinese rely on a preprocessing step of word segmentation, thereby assuming there was a clearly defined boundary between morphology and syntax in Chinese. We show how this assumption can fail badly, leading to many out-of-vocabulary words and incompatible annotations. Hence in practice the strict separation of morphology and syntax in the Chinese language proves to be untenable. We present a unified dependency parsing approach for Chinese which takes unsegmented sentences as input and outputs both morphological and syntactic structures with a single model and algorithm. By removing the intermediate word segmentation, the unified parser no longer needs separate notions for words and phrases. Evaluation proves the effectiveness of the unified model and algorithm in parsing structures of words, phrases and sen- tences simultaneously. 1</p><p>4 0.27405012 <a title="70-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Extracting_Opinion_Expressions_with_semi-Markov_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">51 emnlp-2012-Extracting Opinion Expressions with semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Bishan Yang ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: Extracting opinion expressions from text is usually formulated as a token-level sequence labeling task tackled using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). CRFs, however, do not readily model potentially useful segment-level information like syntactic constituent structure. Thus, we propose a semi-CRF-based approach to the task that can perform sequence labeling at the segment level. We extend the original semi-CRF model (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004) to allow the modeling of arbitrarily long expressions while accounting for their likely syntactic structure when modeling segment boundaries. We evaluate performance on two opinion extraction tasks, and, in contrast to previous sequence labeling approaches to the task, explore the usefulness of segment- level syntactic parse features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both opinion expression tasks.</p><p>5 0.23626889 <a title="70-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Transition-Based_System_for_Joint_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_and_Labeled_Non-Projective_Dependency_Parsing.html">12 emnlp-2012-A Transition-Based System for Joint Part-of-Speech Tagging and Labeled Non-Projective Dependency Parsing</a></p>

We present a transitionbased system for joint part-of-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with nonprojective trees.

<p>Author: Alexander Rush ; Roi Reichart ; Michael Collins ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art statistical parsers and POS taggers perform very well when trained with large amounts of in-domain data. When training data is out-of-domain or limited, accuracy degrades. In this paper, we aim to compensate for the lack of available training data by exploiting similarities between test set sentences. We show how to augment sentencelevel models for parsing and POS tagging with inter-sentence consistency constraints. To deal with the resulting global objective, we present an efficient and exact dual decomposition decoding algorithm. In experiments, we add consistency constraints to the MST parser and the Stanford part-of-speech tagger and demonstrate significant error reduction in the domain adaptation and the lightly supervised settings across five languages.</p><p>6 0.58724499 <a title="70-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Extracting_Opinion_Expressions_with_semi-Markov_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">51 emnlp-2012-Extracting Opinion Expressions with semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields</a></p>

<p>Author: Doo Soon Kim ; Kunal Verma ; Peter Yeh</p><p>Abstract: Short listings such as classified ads or product listings abound on the web. If a computer can reliably extract information from them, it will greatly benefit a variety of applications. Short listings are, however, challenging to process due to their informal styles. In this paper, we present an unsupervised information extraction system for short listings. Given a corpus of listings, the system builds a semantic model that represents typical objects and their attributes in the domain of the corpus, and then uses the model to extract information. Two key features in the system are a semantic parser that extracts objects and their attributes and a listing-focused clustering module that helps group together extracted tokens of same type. Our evaluation shows that the , semantic model learned by these two modules is effective across multiple domains.</p><p>3 0.90254158 <a title="70-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Unified_Dependency_Parsing_of_Chinese_Morphological_and_Syntactic_Structures.html">131 emnlp-2012-Unified Dependency Parsing of Chinese Morphological and Syntactic Structures</a></p>

<p>Author: Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Brianna Satinoff ; He He ; Hal Daume III</p><p>Abstract: Cost-sensitive classification, where thefeatures used in machine learning tasks have a cost, has been explored as a means of balancing knowledge against the expense of incrementally obtaining new features. We introduce a setting where humans engage in classification with incrementally revealed features: the collegiate trivia circuit. By providing the community with a web-based system to practice, we collected tens of thousands of implicit word-by-word ratings of how useful features are for eliciting correct answers. Observing humans’ classification process, we improve the performance of a state-of-the art classifier. We also use the dataset to evaluate a system to compete in the incremental classification task through a reduction of reinforcement learning to classification. Our system learns when to answer a question, performing better than baselines and most human players.</p><p>5 0.87703377 <a title="70-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Part-of-Speech_Tagging_for_Chinese-English_Mixed_Texts_with_Dynamic_Features.html">106 emnlp-2012-Part-of-Speech Tagging for Chinese-English Mixed Texts with Dynamic Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiayi Zhao ; Xipeng Qiu ; Shu Zhang ; Feng Ji ; Xuanjing Huang</p><p>Abstract: In modern Chinese articles or conversations, it is very popular to involve a few English words, especially in emails and Internet literature. Therefore, it becomes an important and challenging topic to analyze Chinese-English mixed texts. The underlying problem is how to tag part-of-speech (POS) for the English words involved. Due to the lack of specially annotated corpus, most of the English words are tagged as the oversimplified type, “foreign words”. In this paper, we present a method using dynamic features to tag POS of mixed texts. Experiments show that our method achieves higher performance than traditional sequence labeling methods. Meanwhile, our method also boosts the performance of POS tagging for pure Chinese texts.</p><p>6 0.69852746 <a title="70-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Why_Question_Answering_using_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Word_Classes.html">137 emnlp-2012-Why Question Answering using Sentiment Analysis and Word Classes</a></p>

<p>Author: David Burkett ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We describe a transformation-based learning method for learning a sequence of monolingual tree transformations that improve the agreement between constituent trees and word alignments in bilingual corpora. Using the manually annotated English Chinese Translation Treebank, we show how our method automatically discovers transformations that accommodate differences in English and Chinese syntax. Furthermore, when transformations are learned on automatically generated trees and alignments from the same domain as the training data for a syntactic MT system, the transformed trees achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over baseline trees.</p><p>3 0.10000233 <a title="38-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Unified_Dependency_Parsing_of_Chinese_Morphological_and_Syntactic_Structures.html">131 emnlp-2012-Unified Dependency Parsing of Chinese Morphological and Syntactic Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongguo Li ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Most previous approaches to syntactic parsing of Chinese rely on a preprocessing step of word segmentation, thereby assuming there was a clearly defined boundary between morphology and syntax in Chinese. We show how this assumption can fail badly, leading to many out-of-vocabulary words and incompatible annotations. Hence in practice the strict separation of morphology and syntax in the Chinese language proves to be untenable. We present a unified dependency parsing approach for Chinese which takes unsegmented sentences as input and outputs both morphological and syntactic structures with a single model and algorithm. By removing the intermediate word segmentation, the unified parser no longer needs separate notions for words and phrases. Evaluation proves the effectiveness of the unified model and algorithm in parsing structures of words, phrases and sen- tences simultaneously. 1</p><p>4 0.099001773 <a title="38-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Part-of-Speech_Tagging_for_Chinese-English_Mixed_Texts_with_Dynamic_Features.html">106 emnlp-2012-Part-of-Speech Tagging for Chinese-English Mixed Texts with Dynamic Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiayi Zhao ; Xipeng Qiu ; Shu Zhang ; Feng Ji ; Xuanjing Huang</p><p>Abstract: In modern Chinese articles or conversations, it is very popular to involve a few English words, especially in emails and Internet literature. Therefore, it becomes an important and challenging topic to analyze Chinese-English mixed texts. The underlying problem is how to tag part-of-speech (POS) for the English words involved. Due to the lack of specially annotated corpus, most of the English words are tagged as the oversimplified type, “foreign words”. In this paper, we present a method using dynamic features to tag POS of mixed texts. Experiments show that our method achieves higher performance than traditional sequence labeling methods. Meanwhile, our method also boosts the performance of POS tagging for pure Chinese texts.</p><p>5 0.080786392 <a title="38-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Comparison_of_Vector-based_Representations_for_Semantic_Composition.html">4 emnlp-2012-A Comparison of Vector-based Representations for Semantic Composition</a></p>
<p>Author: William Blacoe ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of modeling compositional meaning for phrases and sentences using distributional methods. We experiment with several possible combinations of representation and composition, exhibiting varying degrees of sophistication. Some are shallow while others operate over syntactic structure, rely on parameter learning, or require access to very large corpora. We find that shallow approaches are as good as more computationally intensive alternatives with regards to two particular tests: (1) phrase similarity and (2) paraphrase detection. The sizes of the involved training corpora and the generated vectors are not as important as the fit between the meaning representation and compositional method.</p><p>6 0.076235399 <a title="38-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Chinese_Word_Segmentation%2C_POS_Tagging_and_Parsing.html">70 emnlp-2012-Joint Chinese Word Segmentation, POS Tagging and Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Hila Weisman ; Jonathan Berant ; Idan Szpektor ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: Learning inference relations between verbs is at the heart of many semantic applications. However, most prior work on learning such rules focused on a rather narrow set of information sources: mainly distributional similarity, and to a lesser extent manually constructed verb co-occurrence patterns. In this paper, we claim that it is imperative to utilize information from various textual scopes: verb co-occurrence within a sentence, verb cooccurrence within a document, as well as overall corpus statistics. To this end, we propose a much richer novel set of linguistically motivated cues for detecting entailment between verbs and combine them as features in a supervised classification framework. We empirically demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous methods and that information from each textual scope contributes to the verb entailment learning task.</p><p>3 0.40687647 <a title="38-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Transforming_Trees_to_Improve_Syntactic_Convergence.html">127 emnlp-2012-Transforming Trees to Improve Syntactic Convergence</a></p>

<p>Author: Wenbin Jiang ; Fandong Meng ; Qun Liu ; Yajuan Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we first describe the technology of automatic annotation transformation, which is based on the annotation adaptation algorithm (Jiang et al., 2009). It can automatically transform a human-annotated corpus from one annotation guideline to another. We then propose two optimization strategies, iterative training and predict-selfreestimation, to further improve the accuracy of annotation guideline transformation. Experiments on Chinese word segmentation show that, the iterative training strategy together with predictself reestimation brings significant improvement over the simple annotation transformation baseline, and leads to classifiers with significantly higher accuracy and several times faster processing than annotation adaptation does. On the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0, , it achieves an F-measure of 98.43%, significantly outperforms previous works although using a single classifier with only local features.</p><p>5 0.31364328 <a title="38-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Part-of-Speech_Tagging_for_Chinese-English_Mixed_Texts_with_Dynamic_Features.html">106 emnlp-2012-Part-of-Speech Tagging for Chinese-English Mixed Texts with Dynamic Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Carina Silberer ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: A popular tradition of studying semantic representation has been driven by the assumption that word meaning can be learned from the linguistic environment, despite ample evidence suggesting that language is grounded in perception and action. In this paper we present a comparative study of models that represent word meaning based on linguistic and perceptual data. Linguistic information is approximated by naturally occurring corpora and sensorimotor experience by feature norms (i.e., attributes native speakers consider important in describing the meaning of a word). The models differ in terms of the mechanisms by which they integrate the two modalities. Experimental results show that a closer correspondence to human data can be obtained by uncovering latent information shared among the textual and perceptual modalities rather than arriving at semantic knowledge by concatenating the two.</p><p>3 0.53946525 <a title="38-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Entity_and_Event_Coreference_Resolution_across_Documents.html">71 emnlp-2012-Joint Entity and Event Coreference Resolution across Documents</a></p>
<p>Author: Heeyoung Lee ; Marta Recasens ; Angel Chang ; Mihai Surdeanu ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel coreference resolution system that models entities and events jointly. Our iterative method cautiously constructs clusters of entity and event mentions using linear regression to model cluster merge operations. As clusters are built, information flows between entity and event clusters through features that model semantic role dependencies. Our system handles nominal and verbal events as well as entities, and our joint formulation allows information from event coreference to help entity coreference, and vice versa. In a cross-document domain with comparable documents, joint coreference resolution performs significantly better (over 3 CoNLL F1 points) than two strong baselines that resolve entities and events separately.</p><p>4 0.52055752 <a title="38-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Concurrent_Acquisition_of_Word_Meaning_and_Lexical_Categories.html">29 emnlp-2012-Concurrent Acquisition of Word Meaning and Lexical Categories</a></p>
<p>Author: Afra Alishahi ; Grzegorz Chrupala</p><p>Abstract: Learning the meaning of words from ambiguous and noisy context is a challenging task for language learners. It has been suggested that children draw on syntactic cues such as lexical categories of words to constrain potential referents of words in a complex scene. Although the acquisition of lexical categories should be interleaved with learning word meanings, it has not previously been modeled in that fashion. In this paper, we investigate the interplay of word learning and category induction by integrating an LDA-based word class learning module with a probabilistic word learning model. Our results show that the incrementally induced word classes significantly improve word learning, and their contribution is comparable to that of manually assigned part of speech categories. 1 Learning the Meaning of Words For young learners of a natural language, mapping each word to its correct meaning is a challenging task. Words are often used as part of an utterance rather than in isolation. The meaning of an utterance must be inferred from among numerous possible interpretations that the (usually complex) surrounding scene offers. In addition, the linguistic and visual context in which words are heard and used is often noisy and highly ambiguous. Particularly, many words in a language are polysemous and have different meanings. Various learning mechanisms have been proposed for word learning. One well-studied mechanism is cross-situational learning, a bottom-up strategy based on statistical co-occurrence of words and referents across situations (Quine 1960, Pinker 1989). 643 Grzegorz Chrupała gchrupala@ l .uni-s aarland .de sv Spoken Language Systems Saarland University, Germany Several experimental studies have shown that adults and children are sensitive to cross-situational evidence and use this information for mapping words to objects, actions and properties (Smith and Yu 2007, Monaghan and Mattock 2009). A number of computational models have been developed based on this principle, demonstrating that cross-situational learning is a powerful and efficient mechanism for learning the correct mappings between words and meanings from noisy input (e.g. Siskind 1996, Yu 2005, Fazly et al. 2010). Another potential source of information that can help the learner to constrain the relevant aspects of a scene is the sentential context of a word. It has been suggested that children draw on syntactic cues provided by the linguistic context in order to guide word learning, a hypothesis known as syntactic bootstrapping (Gleitman 1990). There is substantial evidence that children are sensitive to the structural regularities of language from a very young age, and that they use these structural cues to find the referent of a novel word (e.g. Naigles and Hoff-Ginsberg 1995, Gertner et al. 2006). In particular, young children have robust knowledge of some of the abstract lexical categories such as nouns and verbs (e.g. Gelman and Taylor 1984, Kemp et al. 2005). Recent studies have examined the interplay of cross-situational learning and sentence-level learning mechanisms, showing that adult learners of an artificial language can successfully and simultaneously apply cues and constraints from both sources of information when mapping words to their referents (Gillette et al. 1999, Lidz et al. 2010, Koehne and Crocker 2010; 2011). Several computational models have also investigated this interaction by adding manually annotated part-of-speech tags as PLraoncge uadgineg Lse oafr tnhineg 2,0 p1a2g Jeosin 64t C3–o6n5f4e,re Jnecjue Iosnla Enmd,p Kiroicraela, M 1e2t–h1o4ds Ju ilny N 20a1tu2r.a ?lc L2a0n1g2ua Agseso Pcrioactieosnsi fnogr a Cnodm Cpoumtaptiuotna tilo Lnianlg Nuaist uircasl input to word learning algorithms, and suggesting that integration of lexical categories can boost the performance of a cross-situational model (Yu 2006, Alishahi and Fazly 2010). However, none of the existing experimental or computational studies have examined the acquisition of word meanings and lexical categories in parallel. They all make the simplifying assumption that prior to the onset of word learning, the categoriza- tion module has already formed a relatively robust set of lexical categories. This assumption can be justified in the case of adult learners of a second or artificial language. But children’s acquisition of categories is most probably interleaved with the acquisition of word meaning, and these two processes must ultimately be studied simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate concurrent acquisition of word meanings and lexical categories. We use an online version of the LDA algorithm to induce a set of word classes from child-directed speech, and integrate them into an existing probabilistic model of word learning which combines cross-situational evidence with cues from lexical categories. Through a number of simulations of a word learning scenario, we show that our automatically and incrementally induced categories significantly improve the performance ofthe word learning model, and are closely comparable to a set of goldstandard, manually-annotated part of speech tags. 2 A Word Learning Model We want to investigate whether lexical categories (i.e. word classes) that are incrementally induced from child-directed speech can improve the performance of a cross-situational word learning model. For this purpose, we use the model of Alishahi and Fazly (2010). This model uses a probabilistic learning algorithm for combining evidence from word– referent co-occurrence statistics and the meanings associated with a set of pre-defined categories. They use child-directed utterances, manually annotated with a small set of part of speech tags, from the Manchester corpus (Theakston et al. 2001) in the CHILDES database (MacWhinney 1995). Their experimental results show that integrating these goldstandard categories into the algorithm boosts its performance over a pure cross-situational version. 644 The model of Alishahi and Fazly (2010) has the suitable architecture for our goal: it provides an integrated learning mechanism which combines evidence from word-referent co-occurrence with cues from the meaning representation associated with word categories. However, the model has two major shortcomings. First, it assumes that lexical categories are formed and finalized prior to the onset of word learning and that a correct and unique category for a target word can be identified at each point in time, assumptions that are highly unlikely. Second, it does not handle any ambiguity in the meaning of a word. Instead, each word is assumed to have only one correct meaning. Considering the high level of lexical ambiguity in most natural languages, this assumption unreasonably simplifies the word learning problem. To investigate the plausibility of integrating word and category learning, we use an online algorithm for automatically and incrementally inducing a set of lexical categories. Moreover, we use each word in its original form instead of lemmatizing them, which implies that categories contain different morphological forms of the same word. By applying these changes, we are able to study the contribution of lexical categories to word learning in a more realistic scenario. Representation of input. The input to the model consists of a sequence of utterances, each paired with a representation of an observed scene. We represent an utterance as a set of words, U = {w} (e.g. {she, went, home, ... }), aonfd w wthored corresponding scene as a set not,f hsoemmaen, .ti.c.} features, S c = {f} (e.g. {ANIMATE, HUMAN, FEMALE, ...}). Word and category meaning. We represent the meaning of a word as a time-dependent probability distribution over all the semantic features, where (f|w) |isw t)h oev probability mofa fnetaictur feea f rbees-, ing associa(tefd|w ww)i tish twhoerd p w aatb tiilmitye t o. fI fne tahteu raeb sfen bceeof any prior knowledge, the model assumes a uniform distribution over all features as the meaning of a novel word. Also, a function (w) gives us the category to which a word w in utterance belongs. At each point in time, a category c contains a set of word tokens. We assign a meaning to each category as a weighted sum of the meaning learned so far for each of its members, or p(t) (f|c) = (1/|c|) Pw∈c (f|w), where |c| is the nu(fm|bc)er o=f (w1o/r|dc |t)oPkenws∈ icn c a(tf t|hwe )c,u wrrheenrte em |co|m iesn tht. p(t) p(t)(·|w) cat(t) U(t) p(t) Learning algorithm. Given an utterance-scene pair (U(t) , S(t) ) received at time t, the model first calculates an alignment score a for each word w ∈ laantde se aanch a sleigmnamnetinct f secaoturere a f ∈ Sea(tc)h . Aw oserdm want ∈ic Ufea- U(t) × taunrde can h b see aligned fteoa a wreo frd ∈ according to the meaning acquired for that word from previous observations (word-based alignment, or aw). Alternatively, distributional clues of the word can be used to determine its category, and the semantic features can be aligned to the word according to the meaning associated to its category (category-based alignment, or ac). We combine these two sources of evidence when estimating an alignment score: a(w|f, U(t), S(t)) = λ(w) +(1 − λ(w)) U(t), S(t)) ac(w|f, U(t), S(t)) aw(w|f, (1) where the word-based and category-based alignment scores are estimated based on the acquired meanings of the word and its category, respectively: aw(w|f,U(t),S(t)) = Xp(t−p1(t)(−f1|)w(f)|wk) wkX∈U(t) ac(w|f,U(t),S(t)) = Xp(t−p1()t(−f1)|(cfat|c(awt)()wk)) wkX∈U(t) The relative contribution ofthe word-based versus the category-based alignment is determined by the weight function λ(w). Cross-situational evidence is a reliable cue for frequent words; on the other hand, the category-based score is most informative when the model encounters a low-frequency word (See Alishahi and Fazly (2010) for a full analysis of the frequency effect). Therefore, we define λ(w) as a function of the frequency of the word n(w) : λ(w) = n(w)/(n(w) + 1) Once an alignment score is calculated for each word w ∈ and each feature f ∈ S(t) , the model rweovirsdes w t ∈he U meanings cohf aeallt utrhee fw ∈ord Ss in and U(t) U(t) 645 their corresponding categories as follows: assoc(t)(w, f) = assoc(t−1)(w, f) + a(w|f, U(t), S(t)) where assoc(t−1) (w, f) is zero if w and f have not co-occurred before. These association scores are then used to update the meaning of the words in the current input: × p(t)(f|w) =Xasasossco(tc)( tf),(f wj,) w) fXj X∈F (2) where F is the set of all features seen so far.

Uniform categories. Adding the category-based alignment as a new factor to Eqn. (1) might imply that the role of categories in this model is nothing more than smoothing the cross-situational-based alignment of words and referents. In order to investigate this issue, we use the following alignment formula as an informed baseline in our experiments, where we replace ac(· |f, U(t) , S(t)) with a uniform distribution:1 a(w|f, U(t), S(t)) = λ(w) U(t), S(t)) +(1 − λ(w)) ×|U1(t)| aw(w|f, (3) where aw (w| f, U(t) , S(t) ) and λ(w) are estimated as before. In( our experiments in Section 4, we refer to this baseline as the ‘uniform’ condition. 3 Online induction of word classes with LDA Empirical findings suggest that young children form their knowledge of abstract categories, such as verbs, nouns, and adjectives, gradually (e.g. Gelman and Taylor 1984, Kemp et al. 2005). In addition, several unsupervised computational models have been proposed for inducing categories of words which resemble part-of-speech categories, by 1We thank an anonymous reviewers for suggesting this dition as an informed baseline. con- drawing on distributional properties of their context (see for example Redington et al. 1998, Clark 2000, Mintz 2003, Parisien et al. 2008, Chrupała and Alishahi 2010). However, explicit accounts of how such categories can be integrated in a crosssituational model of word learning have been rare. Here we adopt an online version of the model proposed in Chrupała (201 1), a method of soft word class learning using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The approach is much more efficient than the commonly used alternative (Brown clustering, (Brown et al. 1992)) while at the same time matching or outperforming it when the word classes are used as automatically learned features for supervised learning of various language understanding tasks. Here we adopt this model as our approach to learning lexical categories. In Section 3.1 we describe the LDA model for word classes; in Section 3.2 we discuss the online Gibbs sampler we use for inference. 3.1 Word class learning with LDA Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was introduced by Blei et al. (2003) and is most commonly used for modeling the topic structure in document collections. It is a generative, probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that induces a set of latent variables, which correspond to the topics. The topics themselves are multinomial distributions over words. The generative structure of the LDA model is the following: φk ∼ Dirichlet(β) , k ∈ [1, K] zθdnd∼ D Ciraitcehgloetr(icαa),l(θd), wnd ∼ dnd ∈∈ [1 [1,D,N]d] Categorical(φznd ) , nd (4) ∈ [1, Nd] Chrupała (201 1) reinterprets the LDA model in terms of word classes as follows: K is the number of classes, D is the number of unique word types, Nd is the number ofcontext features (such as right or left neighbor) associated with word type d, znd is the class ofword type d in the ntdh context, and wnd is the ntdh context feature of word type d. Hyperparameters α and β control the sparseness of the vectors θd and φk. 646 Wordtype Features HowdoR do you HowL doL youR youL doR Table 1: Matrix of context features 1.8M words (CHILDES) 100M words (BNC) tsbgmrhioav oinekseycrbhaolrb ilnetbhgiesbJcmula nsceinkswMlwaionhalrmgituceahnge Table 2: Most similar word pairs As an example consider the small corpus consisting of the single sentence How do you do. The rows in Table 1 show the features w1 . . . wNd for each word type d if we use each word’s left and right neighbors as features, and subscript words with L and R to indicate left and right. After inference, the θd parameters correspond to word class probability distributions given a word type while the φk correspond to feature distributions given a word class: the model provides a probabilistic representation for word types independently of their context, and also for contexts independently of the word type. Probabilistic, soft word classes are more expressive than hard categories. First, they make it easy and efficient to express shared ambiguities: Chrupała (201 1) gives an example of words used as either first names or surnames, and this shared ambiguity is reflected in the similarity of their word class distributions. Second, with soft word classes it becomes easy to express graded similarity between words: as an example, Table 2 shows a random selection out of the 100 most similar word pairs according to the Jensen-Shannon divergence between their word class distributions, according to a word class model with 25 classes induced from (i) 1.8 million words of the CHILDES corpus or (ii) 100 million word of the BNC corpus. The similarities were measured between each of the 1000 most frequent CHILDES or BNC words. 3.2 Online Gibbs sampling for LDA There have been a number of attempts to develop online inference algorithms for topic modeling with LDA. A simple modification of the standard Gibbs sampler (o-LDA) was proposed by Song et al. (2005) and Banerjee and Basu (2007). Canini et al. (2009) experiment with three sampling algorithms for online topic inference: (i) oLDA, (ii) incremental Gibbs sampler, and (iii) a par- ticle filter. Only o-LDA is truly online in the sense that it does not revisit previously seen documents. The other two, the incremental Gibbs sampler and the particle filter, keep seen documents and periodically resample them. In Canini et al.’s experiments all of the online algorithms perform worse than the standard batch Gibbs sampler on a document clustering task. Hoffman et al. (2010) develop an online version of the variational Bayes (VB) optimization method for inference for topic modeling with LDA. Their method achieves good empirical results compared to batch VB as measured by perplexity on heldout data, especially when used with large minibatch sizes. Online VB for LDA is appropriate when streaming documents: with online VB documents are represented as word count tables. In our scenario where we apply LDA to modeling word classes we need to process context features from sentences arriving in a stream: i.e. we need to sample entries from a table like Table 1 in order of arrival rather than row by row. This means that online VB is not directly applicable to online word-class induction. However it also means that one issue with o-LDA identified by Canini et al. (2009) is ameliorated. When sampling in a topic modeling setting, documents are unique and are never seen again. Thus, the topics associated with old documents get stale and need to be periodically rejuvenated (i.e. resampled). This is the reason why the incremental Gibbs sampler and the particle filter algorithms in Canini et al. (2009) need to keep old documents around and cannot run in a true online fashion. Since for word class modeling we stream context features as they arrive, we will continue to see features associated with the seen word types, and will automatically resample their class assignments. In exploratory ex647 periments we have seen that this narrows the performance gap between the o-LDA sampler and the batch collapsed Gibbs sampler. We present our version of the o-LDA sampler in Algorithm 1. For each incoming sentence t we run J passes of sampling, updating the counts tables after each sampling step. We sample the class assignment zti for feature wti according to: P(zt|zt−1,wt,dt) ∝(nztt−,d1Pt+jV=t− α11)n ×ztt−, (w1njtz−t+,1wt β+ β), (5) where stands for the nPumber of times class z co-occurred with word type d up to step t, and similarly ntz,w is the number of times feature w was assigned to class z. Vt is the number of unique features seen up to step t, while α and β are the LDA hyperparameters. There are two differences between the original o-LDA and our version: we do not initialize the algorithm with a batch run over a prefix of the data, and we allow more than one sampling pass per sentence.2 Exploratory experiments have shown that batch initialization is unnecessary, and that multiple passes typically improve the quality of the induced word classes. ntz,d Algorithm 1 Online Gibbs sampler for word class induction with LDA for t = 1 → ∞ do fto =r j = →1 → dJo do fjor = =i = →1 → It do sample zti ∼ P(zti |zti−1 , wti , dti ) increment ntzti,wti and ntzti,dti Figure 1 shows the top 10 words for each of the 10 word classes induced with our online Gibbs sampler from 1.8 million words of CHILDES. Similarly, Figure 2 shows the top 10 words for 5 randomly chosen topics out of 50, learned online from 100 million words of the BNC. The topics are relatively coherent and at these levels of granularity express mostly part of speech and subcategorization frame information. Note that for each word class we show the words most frequently assigned to it while Gibbs sampling. 2Note that we do not allow multiple passes over the stream of sentences. Rather, while processing the current sentence, we allow the words in this sentence to be sampled more than once.

Thus frequently occurring words such as not will typically be listed for several classes. 4 Evaluation 4.1 Experimental setup As training data, we extract utterances from the Manchester corpus (Theakston et al. 2001) in the CHILDES database (MacWhinney 1995), a corpus that contains transcripts of conversations with children between the ages of 1 year, 8 months and 3 years. We use the mother’s speech from transcripts of 12 children (henceforth referred to by children’s names). We run word class induction while simultaneously outputting the highest scoring word-class label for each word: for a new sentence, we sample class assignments for each feature (doing J passes), update the counts, and then for each word dti output the highest scoring class label according to argmaxz ntz,dti (where ntz,dti stands for the num- 648 ber of times class z co-occurred with word type dti up to step t). During development we ran the online word class induction module on data for Aran, Becky, Carl and Anne and then started the word learning module for the Anne portion while continuing inducing categories. We then evaluated word learning on Anne. We chose the parameters of the word class induction module based on those development results: α = 10, β = 0.1, K = 10 and J = 20. We used cross-validation for the final evaluation. PFor each of six data files (Anne, Aran, Becky, Carl, Dominic and Gail), we ran word-class induction on the whole corpus with the chosen file last, and then started applying the word-learning algorithm on this last chosen file (while continuing with category induction). We evaluated how well word meanings were learned in those six cases. We follow Alishahi and Fazly (2010) in the construction of the input. We need a semantic representation paired with each utterance. Such a representation is not available from the corpus and has to be P1K=1 constructed. We automatically construct a gold lexicon for all nouns and verbs in this corpus as follows. For each word, we extract all hypernyms for its first sense in the appropriate (verb or noun) hierarchy in WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), and add the first word in the synset of each hypernym to the set of semantic features for the target word. For verbs, we also extract features from VerbNet (Kipper et al. 2006). A small subset of words (pronouns and frequent quantifiers) are also manually added. This lexicon represents the true meaning of each word, and is used in generating the scene representations in the input and in evaluation. For each utterance in the input corpus, we form the union of the feature representations of all its words. Words not found in the lexicon (i.e. for which we could not extract a semantic representation from WordNet and VerbNet) are removed from the utterance (only for the word learning module). In order to simulate the high level of noise that children receive from their environment, we follow Alishahi and Fazly (2010) and pair each utterance with a combination of its own scene representation and the scene representation for the following utter- ance. This decision was based on the intuition that consequent utterances are more likely to be about re- SUctenra:ce{BmCPAOLRoNAImOTMSCmEAU,yTOMELaPB,ItTeJH,EIVUObCEMrNToG,cAE. NTo.C,Al}Ti.BILO},EN. Figure 3: A sample input item to the word learning model lated topics and scenes. This results in a (roughly) 200% ambiguity. In addition, we remove the meaning of one random word from the scene representation of every second utterance in an attempt to simulate cases where the referent of an uttered word is not within the perception field (such as ‘daddy is not home yet’). A sample utterance and its corresponding scene are shown in Figure 3. As mentioned before, many words in our input corpus are polysemous. For such words, we extract different sets of features depending on their manually tagged part of speech and keep them in the lexicon (e.g. the lexicon contains two different entries for set:N and set:V). When constructing a scene representation for an utterance which contains an ambiguous word, we choose the correct sense from our lexicon according to the word’s part of speech tag in Manchester corpus. In the experiments reported in the next section, we assess the performance of our model on learning words at each point in time: for each target word, we compare its set of features in the lexicon with its probability distribution over the semantic features that the model has learned. We use mean average precision (MAP) to measure how well (· |w) ranks the features of w. p(t) 4.2 Learning curves To understand whether our categories contribute to learning of word–meaning mappings, we compare the pattern of word learning over time in four conditions. The first condition represents our baseline, in which we do not use category-based alignment in the word learning model by setting λ(w) = 1 in Eqn. (1). In the second condition we use a set of uniformly distributed categories for alignment, as estimated by Eqn. (3) on page 3 (this condition is introduced to examine whether categories act as more than a simple smoothing factor in the align649 UCNoantinefego rmryAvg.0 M0. 6 A3236PStd.0 . D.0 e3 v2 . TabPlLeDO3AS:FinalMeanAv0 e.6 r5a7g29ePrecis0 io.n0 32s09cores ment process.) In the third condition we use the categories induced by online LDA in the word learning model. The fourth condition represents the performance ceiling, in which we use the pre-defined and manually annotated part of speech categories from the Manchester corpus. Table 3 shows the average and the standard deviation of the final MAP scores across the six datasets, for the four conditions (no categories, uniform categories, LDA categories and gold part-of-speech tags). The differences between LDA and None, and between LDA and Uniform are statistically signif- icant according to the paired t test (p < 0.01), while the difference between LDA and POS is not (p = 0.16). Figure 4 shows the learning curves in each condition, averaged over the six splits explained in the previous section. The top panel shows the average learning curve over the minimum number of sentences across the six sub-corpora (8800 sentences). The curves show that our LDA categories significantly improve the performance of the model over both baselines. That means that using these categories can improve word learning compared to not using them and relying on cross-situational evidence alone. Moreover, LDA-induced categories are not merely acting as a smoothing function the way the ‘uniform’ categories are. Our results show that they are bringing relevant information to the task at hand, that is, improving word learning by using the sentential context. In fact, this improvement is comparable to the improvement achieved by integrating the ‘gold-standard’ POS categories. The middle and bottom panels of Figure 4 zoom in on shorter time spans (5000 and 1000 sentences, respectively). These diagrams suggest that the pat- tern of improvement over baseline is relatively constant, even at very early stages of learning. In fact, once the model receives enough input data, crosssituational evidence becomes stronger (since fewer words in the input are encountered for the first time) and the contribution of the categories becomes less significant. 4.3 Class granularity In Figure 5 we show the influence of the number of word classes used on the performance in word learning. It is evident that in the range between 5 to 20 classes the performance ofthe word learning module is quite stable and insensitive to the exact class granularity. Even with only 5 classes the model can still roughly distinguish noun-like words from verb-like words from pronoun-like words, and this will help learn the meaning elements derived from the higher levels of WordNet hierarchy. Notwithstanding that, ideally we would like to avoid having to pre-specify the number of classes for the word class induction module: we thus plan to investigate non-parametric models such as Hierarchical Dirichlet Process for this purpose. 5 Related Work This paper investigates the interplay between two language learning tasks which have so far been studied in isolation: the acquisition of lexical categories from distributional clues, and learning the mapping between words and meanings. Previous models have shown that lexical categories can be learned from unannotated text, mainly drawing on distributional properties of words (e.g. Redington et al. 1998, Clark 2000, Mintz 2003, Parisien et al. 2008, Chrupała and Alishahi 2010). Independently, several computational models have exploited cross-situational evidence in learning the correct mappings between words and meanings, using rule-based inference (Siskind 1996), neural networks (Li et al. 2004, Regier 2005), hierarchical Bayesian models (Frank et al. 2007) and probabilistic alignment inspired by machine translation models (Yu 2005, Fazly et al. 2010). There are only a few existing computational models that explore the role of syntax in word learning. Maurits et al. (2009) investigates the joint acquisition of word meaning and word order using a batch model. This model is tested on an artificial language with a simple first order predicate representation of meaning, and limited built-in possibilities for word 650 Figure 4: Mean average precision for all observed words at each point in time for four conditions: with gold POS categories, with LDA categories, with uniform categories, and without using categories. Each panel displays a different time span.

The model of Niyogi (2002) simulates the mutual bootstrapping effects of syntactic and semantic knowledge in verb learning, that is the use of syntax to aid in inducing the semantics of a verb, and the use of semantics to narrow down possible syntactic frames in which a verb can participate. However, this model relies on manually assigned priors for associations between syntactic and semantic features, and is tested on a toy language with very limited vocabulary and a constrained syntax. Yu (2006) integrates automatically induced syntactic word categories into his model of crosssituational word learning, showing that they can improve the model’s performance. Yu’s model also processes input utterances in a batch mode, and its evaluation is limited to situations in which only a coarse distinction between referring words (words that could potentially refer to objects in a scene, e.g. concrete nouns) and non-referring words (words that cannot possibly refer to objects, e.g. function words) is sufficient. It is thus not clear whether information about finer-grained categories (e.g. verbs and nouns) can indeed help word learning in a more naturalistic incremental setting. On the other hand, the model of Alishahi and Fazly (2010) integrates manually annotated part-ofspeech tags into an incremental word learning algorithm, and shows that these tags boost the over651 all word learning performance, especially for infrequent words. In a different line of research, a number of models have been proposed which study the acquisition of the link between syntax and semantics within the Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) framework (Briscoe 1997, Villavicencio 2002, Buttery 2006, Kwiatkowski et al. 2012). These approaches set the parameters of a semantic parser on a corpus of utterances paired with a logical form as their meaning. These models bring in extensive and detailed prior assumptions about the nature of the syntactic representation (i.e. atomic categories such as S and NP, and built-in rules which govern their combination), as well as about the representation of meaning via the formalism of lambda calculus. This is fundamentally different than the approach taken in this paper, which in comparison only assumes very simple syntactic and semantic representations of syntax. We view word and category learning as stand-alone cognitive tasks with independent representations (word meanings as probabilistic collections of properties or features as opposed to single symbols; categories as sets of word tokens with similar context distribution) and we do not bring in any prior knowledge of specific atomic categories. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we show the plausibility of using automatically and incrementally induced categories while learning word meanings. Our results suggest that the sentential context that a word appears in across its different uses can be used as a complementary source of guidance for mapping it to its featural meaning representation. In Section 4 we show that the improvement achieved by our categories is comparable to that gained by integrating gold POS categories. This result is very encouraging, since manually assigned POS tags are typically believed to set the upper bound on the usefulness of category information. We believe that it automatically induced categories have the potential to do even better: Chrupała and Alishahi (2010) have shown that categories induced from usage data in an unsupervised fashion can be used more effectively than POS categories in a number of tasks. In our experiments here on the development data we observed some improvements over POS categories. This advantage can result from the fact that our categories are more fine-grained (if also more noisy) than POS categories, which sometimes yields more accurate predictions. One important characteristic of the category induction algorithm we have used in this paper is that it provides a soft categorization scheme, where each word is associated with a probability distribution over all categories. In future, we plan to exploit this feature: when estimating the category-based alignment, we can interpolate predictions of multiple categories to which a word belongs, weighted by its probabilities associated with membership in each category.

<p>Author: Bishan Yang ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: Extracting opinion expressions from text is usually formulated as a token-level sequence labeling task tackled using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). CRFs, however, do not readily model potentially useful segment-level information like syntactic constituent structure. Thus, we propose a semi-CRF-based approach to the task that can perform sequence labeling at the segment level. We extend the original semi-CRF model (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004) to allow the modeling of arbitrarily long expressions while accounting for their likely syntactic structure when modeling segment boundaries. We evaluate performance on two opinion extraction tasks, and, in contrast to previous sequence labeling approaches to the task, explore the usefulness of segment- level syntactic parse features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both opinion expression tasks.</p><p>6 0.51839733 <a title="38-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Part-of-Speech_Tagging_for_Chinese-English_Mixed_Texts_with_Dynamic_Features.html">106 emnlp-2012-Part-of-Speech Tagging for Chinese-English Mixed Texts with Dynamic Features</a></p>

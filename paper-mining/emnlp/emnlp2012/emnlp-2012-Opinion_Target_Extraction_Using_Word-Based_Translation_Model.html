<p>Author: Bishan Yang ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: Extracting opinion expressions from text is usually formulated as a token-level sequence labeling task tackled using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). CRFs, however, do not readily model potentially useful segment-level information like syntactic constituent structure. Thus, we propose a semi-CRF-based approach to the task that can perform sequence labeling at the segment level. We extend the original semi-CRF model (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004) to allow the modeling of arbitrarily long expressions while accounting for their likely syntactic structure when modeling segment boundaries. We evaluate performance on two opinion extraction tasks, and, in contrast to previous sequence labeling approaches to the task, explore the usefulness of segment- level syntactic parse features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both opinion expression tasks.</p><p>3 0.39295104 <a title="101-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Answering_Opinion_Questions_on_Products_by_Exploiting_Hierarchical_Organization_of_Consumer_Reviews.html">20 emnlp-2012-Answering Opinion Questions on Products by Exploiting Hierarchical Organization of Consumer Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxing Yu ; Zheng-Jun Zha ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes to generate appropriate answers for opinion questions about products by exploiting the hierarchical organization of consumer reviews. The hierarchy organizes product aspects as nodes following their parent-child relations. For each aspect, the reviews and corresponding opinions on this aspect are stored. We develop a new framework for opinion Questions Answering, which enables accurate question analysis and effective answer generation by making use the hierarchy. In particular, we first identify the (explicit/implicit) product aspects asked in the questions and their sub-aspects by referring to the hierarchy. We then retrieve the corresponding review fragments relevant to the aspects from the hierarchy. In order to gener- ate appropriate answers from the review fragments, we develop a multi-criteria optimization approach for answer generation by simultaneously taking into account review salience, coherence, diversity, and parent-child relations among the aspects. We conduct evaluations on 11 popular products in four domains. The evaluated corpus contains 70,359 consumer reviews and 220 questions on these products. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>4 0.15500386 <a title="101-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Weakly_Supervised_Model_for_Sentence-Level_Semantic_Orientation_Analysis_with_Multiple_Experts.html">14 emnlp-2012-A Weakly Supervised Model for Sentence-Level Semantic Orientation Analysis with Multiple Experts</a></p>
<p>Author: Lizhen Qu ; Rainer Gemulla ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: We propose the weakly supervised MultiExperts Model (MEM) for analyzing the semantic orientation of opinions expressed in natural language reviews. In contrast to most prior work, MEM predicts both opinion polarity and opinion strength at the level of individual sentences; such fine-grained analysis helps to understand better why users like or dislike the entity under review. A key challenge in this setting is that it is hard to obtain sentence-level training data for both polarity and strength. For this reason, MEM is weakly supervised: It starts with potentially noisy indicators obtained from coarse-grained training data (i.e., document-level ratings), a small set of diverse base predictors, and, if available, small amounts of fine-grained training data. We integrate these noisy indicators into a unified probabilistic framework using ideas from ensemble learning and graph-based semi-supervised learning. Our experiments indicate that MEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.</p><p>5 0.096185446 <a title="101-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Collocation_Polarity_Disambiguation_Using_Web-based_Pseudo_Contexts.html">28 emnlp-2012-Collocation Polarity Disambiguation Using Web-based Pseudo Contexts</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanyan Zhao ; Bing Qin ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of collocation polarity disambiguation. The collocation refers to a binary tuple of a polarity word and a target (such as ⟨long, battery life⟩ or ⟨long, ast atratrguep⟩t) (, siunc whh aisch ⟨ ltohneg s,en btatitmeernyt l iofrei⟩en otrat ⟨iolonn gof, tshtaer polarity wwohirdch (“long”) changes along owniothf different targets (“battery life” or “startup”). To disambiguate a collocation’s polarity, previous work always turned to investigate the polarities of its surrounding contexts, and then assigned the majority polarity to the collocation. However, these contexts are limited, thus the resulting polarity is insufficient to be reliable. We therefore propose an unsupervised three-component framework to expand some pseudo contexts from web, to help disambiguate a collocation’s polarity.Without using any additional labeled data, experiments , show that our method is effective.</p><p>6 0.087332442 <a title="101-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Why_Question_Answering_using_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Word_Classes.html">137 emnlp-2012-Why Question Answering using Sentiment Analysis and Word Classes</a></p>

<p>Author: Jong-Hoon Oh ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Chikara Hashimoto ; Takuya Kawada ; Stijn De Saeger ; Jun'ichi Kazama ; Yiou Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we explore the utility of sentiment analysis and semantic word classes for improving why-question answering on a large-scale web corpus. Our work is motivated by the observation that a why-question and its answer often follow the pattern that if something undesirable happens, the reason is also often something undesirable, and if something desirable happens, the reason is also often something desirable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces sentiment analysis to non-factoid question answering. We combine this simple idea with semantic word classes for ranking answers to why-questions and show that on a set of 850 why-questions our method gains 15.2% improvement in precision at the top-1 answer over a baseline state-of-the-art QA system that achieved the best performance in a shared task of Japanese non-factoid QA in NTCIR-6.</p><p>6 0.2217772 <a title="101-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Detecting_Subgroups_in_Online_Discussions_by_Modeling_Positive_and_Negative_Relations_among_Participants.html">32 emnlp-2012-Detecting Subgroups in Online Discussions by Modeling Positive and Negative Relations among Participants</a></p>

<p>Author: Chikara Hashimoto ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Stijn De Saeger ; Jong-Hoon Oh ; Jun'ichi Kazama</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new semantic orientation, Excitation, and its automatic acquisition method. Excitation is a semantic property of predicates that classifies them into excitatory, inhibitory and neutral. We show that Excitation is useful for extracting contradiction pairs (e.g., destroy cancer develop cancer) and causality pairs (cea.ng.c,e rin ⊥cre daesvee lionp c craimnece r⇒) ahnedig chatuensa laintyx pieatyir)s. (Oe.ugr. ,ex ipncerreimaseent ins shc roimw eth ⇒at w heitihg ahtuetnom anatxicieatlyly). acquired Excitation knowledge we can extract one million contradiction pairs and 500,000 causality pairs with about 70% precision from a 600 million page Web corpus. Furthermore, by combining these extracted causality and contradiction pairs, we can generate one million plausible causality hypotheses that are not written in any single sentence in our corpus ⊥ with reasonable precision.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78348756 <a title="101-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2012-Opinion_Target_Extraction_Using_Word-Based_Translation_Model.html">101 emnlp-2012-Opinion Target Extraction Using Word-Based Translation Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Kang Liu ; Liheng Xu ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to extract opinion targets based on wordbased translation model (WTM). At first, we apply WTM in a monolingual scenario to mine the associations between opinion targets and opinion words. Then, a graphbased algorithm is exploited to extract opinion targets, where candidate opinion relevance estimated from the mined associations, is incorporated with candidate importance to generate a global measure. By using WTM, our method can capture opinion relations more precisely, especially for long-span relations. In particular, compared with previous syntax-based methods, our method can effectively avoid noises from parsing errors when dealing with informal texts in large Web corpora. By using graph-based algorithm, opinion targets are extracted in a global process, which can effectively alleviate the problem of error propagation in traditional bootstrap-based methods, such as Double Propagation. The experimental results on three real world datasets in different sizes and languages show that our approach is more effective and robust than state-of-art methods. 1</p><p>3 0.65488166 <a title="101-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Parse%2C_Price_and_Cut-Delayed_Column_and_Row_Generation_for_Graph_Based_Parsers.html">104 emnlp-2012-Parse, Price and Cut-Delayed Column and Row Generation for Graph Based Parsers</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Riedel ; David Smith ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based dependency parsers suffer from the sheer number of higher order edges they need to (a) score and (b) consider during optimization. Here we show that when working with LP relaxations, large fractions of these edges can be pruned before they are fully scored—without any loss of optimality guarantees and, hence, accuracy. This is achieved by iteratively parsing with a subset of higherorder edges, adding higher-order edges that may improve the score of the current solution, and adding higher-order edges that are implied by the current best first order edges. This amounts to delayed column and row generation in the LP relaxation and is guaranteed to provide the optimal LP solution. For second order grandparent models, our method considers, or scores, no more than 6–13% of the second order edges of the full model. This yields up to an eightfold parsing speedup, while pro- viding the same empirical accuracy and certificates of optimality as working with the full LP relaxation. We also provide a tighter LP formulation for grandparent models that leads to a smaller integrality gap and higher speed.</p><p>4 0.63178849 <a title="101-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Forced_Derivation_Tree_based_Model_Training_to_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">54 emnlp-2012-Forced Derivation Tree based Model Training to Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Duan ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: A forced derivation tree (FDT) of a sentence pair {f, e} denotes a derivation tree that can tpraainrsl {afte, f} idnetono itetss a acc duerraivtea target etrea tnhsaltat cioann e. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages structured knowledge contained in FDTs to train component models for statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. We first describe how to generate different FDTs for each sentence pair in training corpus, and then present how to infer the optimal FDTs based on their derivation and alignment qualities. As the first step in this line of research, we verify the effectiveness of our approach in a BTGbased phrasal system, and propose four FDTbased component models. Experiments are carried out on large scale English-to-Japanese and Chinese-to-English translation tasks, and significant improvements are reported on both translation quality and alignment quality.</p><p>5 0.39828476 <a title="101-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Why_Question_Answering_using_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Word_Classes.html">137 emnlp-2012-Why Question Answering using Sentiment Analysis and Word Classes</a></p>
<p>Author: Jong-Hoon Oh ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Chikara Hashimoto ; Takuya Kawada ; Stijn De Saeger ; Jun'ichi Kazama ; Yiou Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we explore the utility of sentiment analysis and semantic word classes for improving why-question answering on a large-scale web corpus. Our work is motivated by the observation that a why-question and its answer often follow the pattern that if something undesirable happens, the reason is also often something undesirable, and if something desirable happens, the reason is also often something desirable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces sentiment analysis to non-factoid question answering. We combine this simple idea with semantic word classes for ranking answers to why-questions and show that on a set of 850 why-questions our method gains 15.2% improvement in precision at the top-1 answer over a baseline state-of-the-art QA system that achieved the best performance in a shared task of Japanese non-factoid QA in NTCIR-6.</p><p>6 0.38965309 <a title="101-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Extracting_Opinion_Expressions_with_semi-Markov_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">51 emnlp-2012-Extracting Opinion Expressions with semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields</a></p>

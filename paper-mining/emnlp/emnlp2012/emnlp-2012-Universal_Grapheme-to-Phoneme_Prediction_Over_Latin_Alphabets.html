<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Hal Daume III</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of building a multilingual transliteration system using an interlingual representation. Our approach uses international phonetic alphabet (IPA) to learn the interlingual representation and thus allows us to use any word and its IPA representation as a training example. Thus, our approach requires only monolingual resources: a phoneme dictionary that lists words and their IPA representations.1 By adding a phoneme dictionary of a new language, we can readily build a transliteration system into any of the existing previous languages, without the expense of all-pairs data or computation. We also propose a regularization framework for learning the interlingual representation, which accounts for language specific phonemic variability, and thus it can find better mappings between languages. Experimental results on the name transliteration task in five diverse languages show a maximum improvement of 29% accuracy and an average improvement of 17% accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art baseline system.</p><p>3 0.079553679 <a title="132-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_to_Map_into_a_Universal_POS_Tagset.html">81 emnlp-2012-Learning to Map into a Universal POS Tagset</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuan Zhang ; Roi Reichart ; Regina Barzilay ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method for mapping language-specific part-of-speech tags to a set of universal tags. This unified representation plays a crucial role in cross-lingual syntactic transfer of multilingual dependency parsers. Until now, however, such conversion schemes have been created manually. Our central hypothesis is that a valid mapping yields POS annotations with coherent linguistic properties which are consistent across source and target languages. We encode this intuition in an objective function that captures a range of distributional and typological characteristics of the derived mapping. Given the exponential size of the mapping space, we propose a novel method for optimizing over soft mappings, and use entropy regularization to drive those towards hard mappings. Our results demonstrate that automatically induced mappings rival the quality of their manually designed counterparts when evaluated in the . context of multilingual parsing.1</p><p>4 0.055696499 <a title="132-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Name_Phylogeny%3A_A_Generative_Model_of_String_Variation.html">96 emnlp-2012-Name Phylogeny: A Generative Model of String Variation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas Andrews ; Jason Eisner ; Mark Dredze</p><p>Abstract: Many linguistic and textual processes involve transduction of strings. We show how to learn a stochastic transducer from an unorganized collection of strings (rather than string pairs). The role of the transducer is to organize the collection. Our generative model explains similarities among the strings by supposing that some strings in the collection were not generated ab initio, but were instead derived by transduction from other, “similar” strings in the collection. Our variational EM learning algorithm alternately reestimates this phylogeny and the transducer parameters. The final learned transducer can quickly link any test name into the final phylogeny, thereby locating variants of the test name. We find that our method can effectively find name variants in a corpus of web strings used to referto persons in Wikipedia, improving over standard untrained distances such as Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein distance.</p><p>5 0.051410794 <a title="132-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_Syntactic_Categories_Using_Paradigmatic_Representations_of_Word_Context.html">79 emnlp-2012-Learning Syntactic Categories Using Paradigmatic Representations of Word Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehmet Ali Yatbaz ; Enis Sert ; Deniz Yuret</p><p>Abstract: We investigate paradigmatic representations of word context in the domain of unsupervised syntactic category acquisition. Paradigmatic representations of word context are based on potential substitutes of a word in contrast to syntagmatic representations based on properties of neighboring words. We compare a bigram based baseline model with several paradigmatic models and demonstrate significant gains in accuracy. Our best model based on Euclidean co-occurrence embedding combines the paradigmatic context representation with morphological and orthographic features and achieves 80% many-to-one accuracy on a 45-tag 1M word corpus.</p><p>6 0.048526805 <a title="132-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Exploiting_Reducibility_in_Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing.html">46 emnlp-2012-Exploiting Reducibility in Unsupervised Dependency Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Carina Silberer ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: A popular tradition of studying semantic representation has been driven by the assumption that word meaning can be learned from the linguistic environment, despite ample evidence suggesting that language is grounded in perception and action. In this paper we present a comparative study of models that represent word meaning based on linguistic and perceptual data. Linguistic information is approximated by naturally occurring corpora and sensorimotor experience by feature norms (i.e., attributes native speakers consider important in describing the meaning of a word). The models differ in terms of the mechanisms by which they integrate the two modalities. Experimental results show that a closer correspondence to human data can be obtained by uncovering latent information shared among the textual and perceptual modalities rather than arriving at semantic knowledge by concatenating the two.</p><p>4 0.22940575 <a title="132-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_to_Map_into_a_Universal_POS_Tagset.html">81 emnlp-2012-Learning to Map into a Universal POS Tagset</a></p>

<p>Author: Akihiro Tamura ; Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for lexicon extraction that extracts translation pairs from comparable corpora by using graphbased label propagation. In previous work, it was established that performance drastically decreases when the coverage of a seed lexicon is small. We resolve this problem by utilizing indirect relations with the bilingual seeds together with direct relations, in which each word is represented by a distribution of translated seeds. The seed distributions are propagated over a graph representing relations among words, and translation pairs are extracted by identifying word pairs with a high similarity in the seed distributions. We propose two types of the graphs: a co-occurrence graph, representing co-occurrence relations between words, and a similarity graph, representing context similarities between words.

In particular, the paper analyses two existing methods: an optimisation problem and a ranking algorithm. We compare these graph-based methods with each other and with the other state-ofthe-art approaches and conclude that graph domain representations offer a competitive solution to the domain adaptation problem. Analysis of the best parameters for graphbased algorithms reveals that there are no optimal values valid for all domain pairs and that these values are dependent on the characteristics of corresponding domains.</p><p>4 0.39628735 <a title="132-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Fast_Large-Scale_Approximate_Graph_Construction_for_NLP.html">52 emnlp-2012-Fast Large-Scale Approximate Graph Construction for NLP</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Goyal ; Hal Daume III ; Raul Guerra</p><p>Abstract: Many natural language processing problems involve constructing large nearest-neighbor graphs. We propose a system called FLAG to construct such graphs approximately from large data sets. To handle the large amount of data, our algorithm maintains approximate counts based on sketching algorithms. To find the approximate nearest neighbors, our algorithm pairs a new distributed online-PMI algorithm with novel fast approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms (variants of PLEB). These algorithms return the approximate nearest neighbors quickly. We show our system’s efficiency in both intrinsic and extrinsic experiments. We further evaluate our fast search algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively on two NLP applications.</p><p>5 0.39439026 <a title="132-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Exploring_Adaptor_Grammars_for_Native_Language_Identification.html">48 emnlp-2012-Exploring Adaptor Grammars for Native Language Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Sze-Meng Jojo Wong ; Mark Dras ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: The task of inferring the native language of an author based on texts written in a second language has generally been tackled as a classification problem, typically using as features a mix of n-grams over characters and part of speech tags (for small and fixed n) and unigram function words. To capture arbitrarily long n-grams that syntax-based approaches have suggested are useful, adaptor grammars have some promise. In this work we investigate their extension to identifying n-gram collocations of arbitrary length over a mix of PoS tags and words, using both maxent and induced syntactic language model approaches to classification. After presenting a new, simple baseline, we show that learned collocations used as features in a maxent model perform better still, but that the story is more mixed for the syntactic language model.</p><p>6 0.39393452 <a title="132-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Concurrent_Acquisition_of_Word_Meaning_and_Lexical_Categories.html">29 emnlp-2012-Concurrent Acquisition of Word Meaning and Lexical Categories</a></p>

[sent-3, score-0.272]
</p><p>2 First, we collect a data-set of 107 languages with known grapheme-phoneme relationships, along with a short text in each language. [sent-4, score-0.144]
</p><p>3 We induce an undirected graphical model that learns phonotactic regularities, thus relating textual patterns to plausible phonemic interpretations across the entire range of languages. [sent-6, score-0.514]
</p><p>4 In other ways, written language harkens further to the past, reflecting aspects of languages long since gone from their spoken forms. [sent-11, score-0.231]
</p><p>5 In this paper, we argue that this imperfect relationship between written symbol and spoken sound can be automatically inferred from textual patterns. [sent-12, score-0.157]
</p><p>6 By examining data for over 100 languages, we train a statistical model to automat332 ically relate graphemic patterns in text to phonemic sequences for never-before-seen languages. [sent-13, score-0.285]
</p><p>7 In an idealized alphabetic system, each phoneme in the language is unambiguously represented by a single grapheme. [sent-15, score-0.372]
</p><p>8 The joint analysis of several languages can increase model accuracy, and enable the development of computational tools for languages with minimal linguistic resources. [sent-20, score-0.288]
</p><p>9 Previous work has focused on settings where just a handful of languages are available. [sent-21, score-0.144]
</p><p>10 On a more practical note, accurately relating graphemes and phonemes to one another is crucial for tasks such as automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech generation. [sent-23, score-0.514]
</p><p>11 Characters in the Roman alphabet can take a wide range of phonemic values across the world’s languages. [sent-31, score-0.181]
</p><p>12 Our task is thus to select a subset of phonemes for each language’s graphemes. [sent-34, score-0.19]
</p><p>13 We develop a probabilistic undirected graphical model for this prediction problem, where a large set of languages serve as training data and a single heldout language serves as test data. [sent-37, score-0.26]
</p><p>14 As we are dealing with texts (written in a roughly phonemic writing system),  the true contextual phonetic realizations, and even using IPA symbols to relate symbols across languages is somewhat theoretically suspect. [sent-40, score-0.558]
</p><p>15 The node is labeled with a binary value to indicate whether grapheme g can represent phoneme p in the language. [sent-43, score-0.676]
</p><p>16 The node and edge features are derived from textual co-occurrence statistics for the graphemes of each language, as well as general information about the language’s family and region. [sent-45, score-0.488]
</p><p>17 Parameters are jointly optimized over the training languages to maximize the likelihood of the node labelings given the observed feature values. [sent-46, score-0.196]
</p><p>18 We apply our model to a novel data-set consisting of grapheme-phoneme mappings for 107 languages with Roman alphabets and short texts. [sent-48, score-0.287]
</p><p>19 Without any edges, our model yields perfect mappings for only 10% of test languages. [sent-56, score-0.121]
</p><p>20 By employing structure learning and including the induced edges, we more than double the number of test languages with perfect predictions. [sent-57, score-0.221]
</p><p>21 (iii) Finally, an analysis of our grapheme-phoneme predictions shows that they do  not achieve certain global characteristics observed across true phoneme inventories. [sent-58, score-0.407]
</p><p>22 Sparse edges are automatically  induced to allow joint training  and prediction over related inventory decisions. [sent-62, score-0.146]
</p><p>23 2  Background and Related Work  In this section, we provide some background on phonetics and phoneme inventories. [sent-63, score-0.331]
</p><p>24 1 Phoneme Inventories The sounds of the world’s languages are produced through a wide variety of articulatory mechanisms. [sent-66, score-0.356]
</p><p>25 Consonants are sounds produced through a partial or complete stricture of the vocal tract, and can be roughly categorized along three independent dimen-  sions: (i) Voicing: whether or not oscillation of the vocal folds accompanies the sound. [sent-67, score-0.251]
</p><p>26 For example, /p/ is a bilabial (the lips touching one another) while /k/ is a velar (tongue touching touching the soft palate). [sent-70, score-0.278]
</p><p>27 In contrast, vowels are voiced sounds produced with an open vocal tract. [sent-73, score-0.323]
</p><p>28 They are categorized primarily based on the position of the tongue and lips, along three dimensions: (i) Roundedness: whether or not the lips are rounded during production of 334 the sound; (ii) Height: the vertical position of the tongue; (iii) Backness: how far forward the tongue lies. [sent-74, score-0.187]
</p><p>29 Linguists have noted several statistical regularities found in phoneme inventories throughout the  world. [sent-75, score-0.514]
</p><p>30 Feature economy refers to the idea that languages tend to minimize the number of differentiating characteristics (e. [sent-76, score-0.246]
</p><p>31 different kinds of voicing, manner, and place) that are used to distinguish consonant phonemes from one another (Clements, 2003). [sent-78, score-0.269]
</p><p>32 In other words, once an articulatory feature is used to mark offone phoneme from another, it will likely be used again to differentiate other phoneme pairs in the same language. [sent-79, score-0.804]
</p><p>33 The principle of Maximal perceptual contrast refers to the idea that the set of vowels employed by a language will be located in phonetic space to maximize their perceptual distances from one another, thus relieving the perceptual burden of the listener (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972). [sent-80, score-0.391]
</p><p>34 Finally, researchers have noted that languages exhibit set patterns in how they sequence their phonemes (Kenstowicz and Kisseberth, 1979). [sent-82, score-0.376]
</p><p>35 These phonotactic regularities and constraints are mirrored in graphemic patterns, and as our experiments show, can be explicitly modeled to achieve high accuracy in our task. [sent-85, score-0.296]
</p><p>36 The focus has been on developing techniques for dealing with the phonemic ambiguity present both in annotated and unseen words. [sent-89, score-0.142]
</p><p>37 Often this involves some level of phonetic analysis in one or both languages. [sent-93, score-0.141]
</p><p>38 When a grapheme maps to more than one phoneme, we do not attempt to disambiguate particular instances of that grapheme in words. [sent-97, score-0.69]
</p><p>39 As our data-set consists entirely of Latin-based writing systems, our work can be viewed as a more fine-grained computational exploration of the space of writing systems, with a focus on phonographic systems with the Latin pedigree. [sent-99, score-0.182]
</p><p>40 3 Multilingual Analysis An influential thread of previous multilingual work starts with the observation that rich linguistic resources exist for some languages but not others. [sent-101, score-0.208]
</p><p>41 , 2005; Padó and Lapata, 2006) In these cases, the existence  of a bilingual parallel text along with highly accurate predictions for one of the languages was assumed. [sent-105, score-0.22]
</p><p>42 An even more recent line of work does away with the assumption of parallel texts and performs joint unsupervised induction for various languages through the use of coupled priors in the context of grammar induction (Cohen and Smith, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010). [sent-115, score-0.144]

</p><p>44 To start, we downloaded and transcribed image files containing grapheme-phoneme mappings for several hundred languages from an online en-  2http://www. [sent-125, score-0.226]
</p><p>45 We then crossreferenced the languages with the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) database (Haspelmath and Bibiko, 2005) as well as the translations available for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). [sent-129, score-0.144]
</p><p>46 Our final set of 107 languages includes those which appeared consistently in all three sources and that employ a Latin alphabet. [sent-130, score-0.144]
</p><p>47 As seen from the figure, these languages cover a wide array of language families and regions. [sent-132, score-0.144]
</p><p>48 We then analyzed the phoneme inventories for the 107 languages. [sent-133, score-0.441]
</p><p>49 We decided to focus our attention on graphemes which are widely used across these languages with a diverse set of phonemic values. [sent-134, score-0.61]
</p><p>50 We measured the ambiguity of each grapheme by calculating the entropy of its phoneme sets across the languages, and found that 17 graphemes had entropy > 0. [sent-135, score-1.104]
</p><p>51 Table 1 lists these graphemes, the set of phonemes that they can represent, the number of languages in  our data-set which employ them, and the entropy of their phoneme-sets across these languages. [sent-137, score-0.386]
</p><p>52 2 Features The key intuition underlying this work is that graphemic patterns in text can reveal the phonemes which they represent. [sent-140, score-0.293]
</p><p>53 Text Context Features: These features represent the textual environment of each grapheme in a language. [sent-143, score-0.435]
</p><p>54 For each grapheme g, we consider counts of graphemes to the immediate left and right of g in the UDHR text. [sent-144, score-0.669]
</p><p>55 We define five feature templates, including counts of (1) single graphemes to the left of g, (2) single graphemes to the right of g, (3) pairs of graphemes to the left of g, (4) pairs of graphemes to the right of g, and (5) pairs of graphemes surrounding g. [sent-145, score-1.62]
</p><p>56 htm#latin  Figure 2: Map and language families of languages in our data-set  these features are too language specific and not abstract enough to yield effective cross-lingual generalization. [sent-150, score-0.182]
</p><p>57 In other words, we would ideally map all the graphemes in our text to phonemes, and then consider the plausibility of the resulting phoneme sequences. [sent-153, score-0.655]
</p><p>58 As an imperfect proxy for this  idea, we made the following observation: for most Latin graphemes, the most common phonemic value across languages is the identical IPA symbol of that grapheme (e. [sent-155, score-0.631]
</p><p>59 the most common phoneme for g is /g/, the most common phoneme for t is /t/, etc). [sent-157, score-0.662]
</p><p>60 Using this observation, we again consider all contexts in which a grapheme appears, but this time map the surrounding graphemes to their IPA phoneme equivalents. [sent-158, score-1.0]
</p><p>61 We then consider various linguistic properties of these surrounding “phonemes” whether they are vowels or consonants, whether they are voiced or not, their manner and places of articulation and create phonetic context features. [sent-159, score-0.416]
</p><p>62 The intuition here is that these features can (noisily) capture the phonotactic context of a grapheme, allowing our model to learn general phonotactic constraints. [sent-161, score-0.362]
</p><p>63 These features allow our model to capture family and region specific phonetic biases. [sent-170, score-0.307]
</p><p>64 For example, African languages are more likely to use c and q to represents clicks than are European languages. [sent-171, score-0.144]
</p><p>65 Thus, a language family feature can combine with a phonetic context feature to represent a family specific phonotactic constraint. [sent-173, score-0.451]
</p><p>66 4  Model  Using the features described above, we develop an undirected graphical model approach to our predic338  Table# 2o:PTFtaehNoxmlutnieFlymbaFeitrcuaoFetfusaretusre s25i87nR6,a49e6w748ac haFt791iel,gt3687oe249re8ydbfore  and after discretization/filtering. [sent-194, score-0.154]
</p><p>67 We learn weights  over our features which optimally relate the input features of the training languages to their observed labels. [sent-198, score-0.26]
</p><p>68 For each node i, we also obtain a feature vector by examining the language’s text and extracting textual and noisy phonetic patterns (as detailed in the previous section). [sent-206, score-0.235]
</p><p>69 Likewise for the graph edges j,k: we extract a feature vector, and depending on the labels of the two vertices yj and yk, take a dot product with the relevant parameters. [sent-211, score-0.151]
</p><p>70 This procedure starts with a fully connected undirected graph structure, and iteratively removes edges between nodes that are conditionally independent given other neighboring nodes in the  graph according to a statistical independence test over all training languages. [sent-215, score-0.309]
</p><p>71 Besides our primary undirected graphical model, we also consider several baselines and variants, in order to assess the contribution of our model’s graph structure as well as the features used. [sent-230, score-0.203]
</p><p>72 In all cases, we perform leave-one-out cross-validation over the 107 languages in our data-set. [sent-231, score-0.144]
</p><p>73 For this metric, we consider each grapheme g and examine its predicted labels over all its possible phonemes: (g : p1) , (g : p2) , . [sent-249, score-0.345]
</p><p>74 We report the percentage of all graphemes with such correct predictions (micro-averaged over all graphemes in all test language scenarios). [sent-254, score-0.724]
</p><p>75 For this metric, we report the percentage of test languages for which our model achieves perfect predictions on all grapheme-phoneme pairs, yielding a perfect mapping. [sent-257, score-0.298]
</p><p>76 The majority baseline yields 67%  F1-measure on the phoneme-level binary prediction task, with 56% grapheme accuracy, and about 3% language accuracy. [sent-260, score-0.345]
</p><p>77 Using undiscretized raw count features, the SVM improves phoneme-level performance to about 80% F1, but fails to provide any improvement on grapheme or language performance. [sent-261, score-0.345]
</p><p>78 In contrast, the SVM using discretized and filtered features achieves performance gains in all three categories, achieving 71% grapheme accuracy and 8% language accuracy. [sent-262, score-0.446]
</p><p>79 Phoneme-level F1 reaches 87%, grapheme accuracy hits 79%, and language accuracy more than doubles, achieving 22%. [sent-266, score-0.345]
</p><p>80 (1) language family and region features, (2) textual context features, and (3) phonetic context features. [sent-269, score-0.321]
</p><p>81 First, it appears that dropping the region and language family features actually improves performance. [sent-272, score-0.205]
</p><p>82 We next observe that dropping the textual context features leads to a small drop in performance. [sent-275, score-0.129]
</p><p>83 Finally, we see that dropping the phonetic context features seriously degrades our model’s accuracy. [sent-276, score-0.218]
</p><p>84 In this section we analyze the predicted phoneme inventories and ask whether they display the statistical properties observed in the gold-standard mappings. [sent-279, score-0.441]
</p><p>85 As outlined in Section 2, consonant phonemes can be represented by the three articulatory features of voicing, manner, and place. [sent-280, score-0.449]
</p><p>86 The principle of feature economy states that phoneme inventories will be organized to minimize the number of distinct articulatory features used in the language, while maximizing the number of resulting phonemes. [sent-281, score-0.723]
</p><p>87 First, we can measure the economy index of a consonant system by computing the ratio of the number of consonantal phonemes to the number of articulatory features used in their production: (Clements, 2003). [sent-283, score-0.551]
</p><p>88 The higher this value, the more economical the sound system. [sent-284, score-0.14]
</p><p>89 Secondly, for each articulatory dimension we can calculate the empirical distribution over values observed across the consonants of the language. [sent-285, score-0.281]
</p><p>90 Since  ##cofenasotunraensts  consonants are produced as combinations of the three articulatory dimensions, the greatest number of consonants (for a given set of utilized feature values) will be produced when the distributions are close to uniform. [sent-286, score-0.42]
</p><p>91 Thus, we can measure how economical each feature dimension is by computing the entropy of its distribution over consonants. [sent-287, score-0.133]
</p><p>92 For example, in an economical system, we would expect roughly half the consonants to be voiced, and half to be unvoiced. [sent-288, score-0.22]
</p><p>93 First, we notice that the average entropy of voiced vs. [sent-290, score-0.174]
</p><p>94 unvoiced consonants is nearly identical in both cases, close to the optimal value. [sent-291, score-0.261]
</p><p>95 However, when we examine the dimensions of place and manner, we notice that the entropy induced by our model is not as high as that of the true consonant inventories, implying a suboptimal allocation of consonants. [sent-292, score-0.169]
</p><p>96 In fact, when we examine the economy index (ratio of consonants to features), we indeed find that on aver–  341  dicted and true consonant inventories (averaged over all 107 languages). [sent-293, score-0.43]
</p><p>97 age our model’s predictions are not as economical as the gold standard. [sent-294, score-0.157]
</p><p>98 –  7  Conclusions  In this paper, we considered a novel problem: that of automatically relating written symbols to spoken sounds for an unknown language using a known writing system the Latin alphabet. [sent-296, score-0.207]
</p><p>99 Our model automatically learns how to relate textual patterns of the unknown language to plausible phonemic interpretations using induced phonotactic regularities. [sent-299, score-0.476]

<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Hal Daume III</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of building a multilingual transliteration system using an interlingual representation. Our approach uses international phonetic alphabet (IPA) to learn the interlingual representation and thus allows us to use any word and its IPA representation as a training example. Thus, our approach requires only monolingual resources: a phoneme dictionary that lists words and their IPA representations.1 By adding a phoneme dictionary of a new language, we can readily build a transliteration system into any of the existing previous languages, without the expense of all-pairs data or computation. We also propose a regularization framework for learning the interlingual representation, which accounts for language specific phonemic variability, and thus it can find better mappings between languages. Experimental results on the name transliteration task in five diverse languages show a maximum improvement of 29% accuracy and an average improvement of 17% accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art baseline system.</p><p>3 0.13096257 <a title="132-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_to_Map_into_a_Universal_POS_Tagset.html">81 emnlp-2012-Learning to Map into a Universal POS Tagset</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuan Zhang ; Roi Reichart ; Regina Barzilay ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method for mapping language-specific part-of-speech tags to a set of universal tags. This unified representation plays a crucial role in cross-lingual syntactic transfer of multilingual dependency parsers. Until now, however, such conversion schemes have been created manually. Our central hypothesis is that a valid mapping yields POS annotations with coherent linguistic properties which are consistent across source and target languages.

<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Hal Daume III</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of building a multilingual transliteration system using an interlingual representation. Our approach uses international phonetic alphabet (IPA) to learn the interlingual representation and thus allows us to use any word and its IPA representation as a training example. Thus, our approach requires only monolingual resources: a phoneme dictionary that lists words and their IPA representations.1 By adding a phoneme dictionary of a new language, we can readily build a transliteration system into any of the existing previous languages, without the expense of all-pairs data or computation. We also propose a regularization framework for learning the interlingual representation, which accounts for language specific phonemic variability, and thus it can find better mappings between languages. Experimental results on the name transliteration task in five diverse languages show a maximum improvement of 29% accuracy and an average improvement of 17% accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art baseline system.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.91764092 <a title="132-lsi-2" href="./emnlp-2012-Universal_Grapheme-to-Phoneme_Prediction_Over_Latin_Alphabets.html">132 emnlp-2012-Universal Grapheme-to-Phoneme Prediction Over Latin Alphabets</a></p>

We then cast our task in the framework of supervised learning, where each known language serves as a training example, and predictions are made on unknown languages.

<p>Author: Jayant Krishnamurthy ; Tom Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for training a semantic parser using only a knowledge base and an unlabeled text corpus, without any individually annotated sentences. Our key observation is that multiple forms ofweak supervision can be combined to train an accurate semantic parser: semantic supervision from a knowledge base, and syntactic supervision from dependencyparsed sentences. We apply our approach to train a semantic parser that uses 77 relations from Freebase in its knowledge representation. This semantic parser extracts instances of binary relations with state-of-theart accuracy, while simultaneously recovering much richer semantic structures, such as conjunctions of multiple relations with partially shared arguments. We demonstrate recovery of this richer structure by extracting logical forms from natural language queries against Freebase. On this task, the trained semantic parser achieves 80% precision and 56% recall, despite never having seen an annotated logical form.</p><p>3 0.40449509 <a title="132-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_to_Map_into_a_Universal_POS_Tagset.html">81 emnlp-2012-Learning to Map into a Universal POS Tagset</a></p>

<p>Author: Lizhen Qu ; Rainer Gemulla ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: We propose the weakly supervised MultiExperts Model (MEM) for analyzing the semantic orientation of opinions expressed in natural language reviews. In contrast to most prior work, MEM predicts both opinion polarity and opinion strength at the level of individual sentences; such fine-grained analysis helps to understand better why users like or dislike the entity under review. A key challenge in this setting is that it is hard to obtain sentence-level training data for both polarity and strength. For this reason, MEM is weakly supervised: It starts with potentially noisy indicators obtained from coarse-grained training data (i.e., document-level ratings), a small set of diverse base predictors, and, if available, small amounts of fine-grained training data. We integrate these noisy indicators into a unified probabilistic framework using ideas from ensemble learning and graph-based semi-supervised learning. Our experiments indicate that MEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.</p><p>5 0.39575949 <a title="132-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Answering_Opinion_Questions_on_Products_by_Exploiting_Hierarchical_Organization_of_Consumer_Reviews.html">20 emnlp-2012-Answering Opinion Questions on Products by Exploiting Hierarchical Organization of Consumer Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxing Yu ; Zheng-Jun Zha ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes to generate appropriate answers for opinion questions about products by exploiting the hierarchical organization of consumer reviews. The hierarchy organizes product aspects as nodes following their parent-child relations. For each aspect, the reviews and corresponding opinions on this aspect are stored. We develop a new framework for opinion Questions Answering, which enables accurate question analysis and effective answer generation by making use the hierarchy. In particular, we first identify the (explicit/implicit) product aspects asked in the questions and their sub-aspects by referring to the hierarchy. We then retrieve the corresponding review fragments relevant to the aspects from the hierarchy. In order to gener- ate appropriate answers from the review fragments, we develop a multi-criteria optimization approach for answer generation by simultaneously taking into account review salience, coherence, diversity, and parent-child relations among the aspects. We conduct evaluations on 11 popular products in four domains. The evaluated corpus contains 70,359 consumer reviews and 220 questions on these products. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>6 0.3936896 <a title="132-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Three_Dependency-and-Boundary_Models_for_Grammar_Induction.html">124 emnlp-2012-Three Dependency-and-Boundary Models for Grammar Induction</a></p>

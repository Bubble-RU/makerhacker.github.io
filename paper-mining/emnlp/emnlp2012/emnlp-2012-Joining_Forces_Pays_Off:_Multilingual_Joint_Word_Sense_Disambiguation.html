<p>Author: Mohamed Yahya ; Klaus Berberich ; Shady Elbassuoni ; Maya Ramanath ; Volker Tresp ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: The Linked Data initiative comprises structured databases in the Semantic-Web data model RDF. Exploring this heterogeneous data by structured query languages is tedious and error-prone even for skilled users. To ease the task, this paper presents a methodology for translating natural language questions into structured SPARQL queries over linked-data sources. Our method is based on an integer linear program to solve several disambiguation tasks jointly: the segmentation of questions into phrases; the mapping of phrases to semantic entities, classes, and relations; and the construction of SPARQL triple patterns. Our solution harnesses the rich type system provided by knowledge bases in the web of linked data, to constrain our semantic-coherence objective function. We present experiments on both the . in question translation and the resulting query answering.</p><p>4 0.081264883 <a title="69-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Explore_Person_Specific_Evidence_in_Web_Person_Name_Disambiguation.html">47 emnlp-2012-Explore Person Specific Evidence in Web Person Name Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Liwei Chen ; Yansong Feng ; Lei Zou ; Dongyan Zhao</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate different usages of feature representations in the web person name disambiguation task which has been suffering from the mismatch of vocabulary and lack of clues in web environments. In literature, the latter receives less attention and remains more challenging. We explore the feature space in this task and argue that collecting person specific evidences from a corpus level can provide a more reasonable and robust estimation for evaluating a featureâ€™s importance in a given web page. This can alleviate the lack of clues where discriminative features can be reasonably weighted by taking their corpus level importance into account, not just relying on the current local context. We therefore propose a topic-based model to exploit the person specific global importance and embed it into the person name similarity. The experimental results show that the corpus level topic in- formation provides more stable evidences for discriminative features and our method outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on three WePS datasets.</p><p>5 0.080112673 <a title="69-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Bilingual_Lexicon_Extraction_from_Comparable_Corpora_Using_Label_Propagation.html">25 emnlp-2012-Bilingual Lexicon Extraction from Comparable Corpora Using Label Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Akihiro Tamura ; Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for lexicon extraction that extracts translation pairs from comparable corpora by using graphbased label propagation. In previous work, it was established that performance drastically decreases when the coverage of a seed lexicon is small. We resolve this problem by utilizing indirect relations with the bilingual seeds together with direct relations, in which each word is represented by a distribution of translated seeds. The seed distributions are propagated over a graph representing relations among words, and translation pairs are extracted by identifying word pairs with a high similarity in the seed distributions. We propose two types of the graphs: a co-occurrence graph, representing co-occurrence relations between words, and a similarity graph, representing context similarities between words. Evaluations using English and Japanese patent comparable corpora show that our proposed graph propagation method outperforms conventional methods. Further, the similarity graph achieved improved performance by clustering synonyms into the same translation.</p><p>6 0.077279128 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Domain_Adaptation_for_Coreference_Resolution%3A_An_Adaptive_Ensemble_Approach.html">36 emnlp-2012-Domain Adaptation for Coreference Resolution: An Adaptive Ensemble Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Roth ; Anette Frank</p><p>Abstract: Generating coherent discourse is an important aspect in natural language generation. Our aim is to learn factors that constitute coherent discourse from data, with a focus on how to realize predicate-argument structures in a model that exceeds the sentence level. We present an important subtask for this overall goal, in which we align predicates across comparable texts, admitting partial argument structure correspondence. The contribution of this work is two-fold: We first construct a large corpus resource of comparable texts, including an evaluation set with manual predicate alignments. Secondly, we present a novel approach for aligning predicates across comparable texts using graph-based clustering with Mincuts. Our method significantly outperforms other alignment techniques when applied to this novel alignment task, by a margin of at least 6.5 percentage points in F1-score.</p><p>3 0.37054831 <a title="69-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Weakly_Supervised_Training_of_Semantic_Parsers.html">136 emnlp-2012-Weakly Supervised Training of Semantic Parsers</a></p>
<p>Author: Jayant Krishnamurthy ; Tom Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for training a semantic parser using only a knowledge base and an unlabeled text corpus, without any individually annotated sentences. Our key observation is that multiple forms ofweak supervision can be combined to train an accurate semantic parser: semantic supervision from a knowledge base, and syntactic supervision from dependencyparsed sentences. We apply our approach to train a semantic parser that uses 77 relations from Freebase in its knowledge representation. This semantic parser extracts instances of binary relations with state-of-theart accuracy, while simultaneously recovering much richer semantic structures, such as conjunctions of multiple relations with partially shared arguments. We demonstrate recovery of this richer structure by extracting logical forms from natural language queries against Freebase. On this task, the trained semantic parser achieves 80% precision and 56% recall, despite never having seen an annotated logical form.</p><p>4 0.36807597 <a title="69-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Discriminative_Model_for_Query_Spelling_Correction_with_Latent_Structural_SVM.html">5 emnlp-2012-A Discriminative Model for Query Spelling Correction with Latent Structural SVM</a></p>
<p>Author: Huizhong Duan ; Yanen Li ; ChengXiang Zhai ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative training in query spelling correction is difficult due to the complex internal structures of the data. Recent work on query spelling correction suggests a two stage approach a noisy channel model that is used to retrieve a number of candidate corrections, followed by discriminatively trained ranker applied to these candidates. The ranker, however, suffers from the fact the low recall of the first, suboptimal, search stage. This paper proposes to directly optimize the search stage with a discriminative model based on latent structural SVM. In this model, we treat query spelling correction as a multiclass classification problem with structured input and output. The latent structural information is used to model the alignment of words in the spelling correction process. Experiment results show that as a standalone speller, our model outperforms all the baseline systems. It also attains a higher recall compared with the noisy channel model, and can therefore serve as a better filtering stage when combined with a ranker.</p><p>5 0.36719862 <a title="69-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Discovering_Diverse_and_Salient_Threads_in_Document_Collections.html">33 emnlp-2012-Discovering Diverse and Salient Threads in Document Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Gillenwater ; Alex Kulesza ; Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic technique for modeling and extracting salient structure from large document collections. As in clustering and topic modeling, our goal is to provide an organizing perspective into otherwise overwhelming amounts of information. We are particularly interested in revealing and exploiting relationships between documents. To this end, we focus on extracting diverse sets of threadsâ€”singlylinked, coherent chains of important documents. To illustrate, we extract research threads from citation graphs and construct timelines from news articles. Our method is highly scalable, running on a corpus of over 30 million words in about four minutes, more than 75 times faster than a dynamic topic model. Finally, the results from our model more closely resemble human news summaries according to several metrics and are also preferred by human judges.</p><p>6 0.36383098 <a title="69-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Weakly_Supervised_Model_for_Sentence-Level_Semantic_Orientation_Analysis_with_Multiple_Experts.html">14 emnlp-2012-A Weakly Supervised Model for Sentence-Level Semantic Orientation Analysis with Multiple Experts</a></p>

<p>Author: Annie Louis ; Ani Nenkova</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a model of coherence which captures the intentional discourse structure in text. Our work is based on the hypothesis that syntax provides a proxy for the communicative goal of a sentence and therefore the sequence of sentences in a coherent discourse should exhibit detectable structural patterns. Results show that our method has high discriminating power for separating out coherent and incoherent news articles reaching accuracies of up to 90%. We also show that our syntactic patterns are correlated with manual annotations of intentional structure for academic conference articles and can successfully predict the coherence of abstract, introduction and related work sections of these articles. 59.3 (100.0) Intro 50.3 (100.0) 1166 Rel wk 55.4 (100.0) >= 0.663.8 (67.2)50.8 (71.1)58.6 (75.9) >= 0.7 67.2 (32.0) 54.4 (38.6) 63.3 (52.8) >= 0.8 74.0 (10.0) 51.6 (22.0) 63.0 (25.7) >= 0.9 91.7 (2.0) 30.6 (5.0) 68.1 (7.2) Table 9: Accuracy (% examples) above each confidence level for the conference versus workshop task. These results are shown in Table 9. The proportion of examples under each setting is also indicated. When only examples above 0.6 confidence are examined, the classifier has a higher accuracy of63.8% for abstracts and covers close to 70% of the examples. Similarly, when a cutoff of 0.7 is applied to the confidence for predicting related work sections, we achieve 63.3% accuracy for 53% of examples. So we can consider that 30 to 47% of the examples in the two sections respectively are harder to tell apart. Interestingly however even high confidence predictions on introductions remain incorrect. These results show that our model can successfully distinguish the structure of articles beyond just clearly incoherent permutation examples. 7 Conclusion Our work is the first to develop an unsupervised model for intentional structure and to show that it has good accuracy for coherence prediction and also complements entity and lexical structure of discourse. This result raises interesting questions about how patterns captured by these different coherence metrics vary and how they can be combined usefully for predicting coherence. We plan to explore these ideas in future work. We also want to analyze genre differences to understand if the strength of these coherence dimensions varies with genre.

<p>Author: Heeyoung Lee ; Marta Recasens ; Angel Chang ; Mihai Surdeanu ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel coreference resolution system that models entities and events jointly. Our iterative method cautiously constructs clusters of entity and event mentions using linear regression to model cluster merge operations. As clusters are built, information flows between entity and event clusters through features that model semantic role dependencies. Our system handles nominal and verbal events as well as entities, and our joint formulation allows information from event coreference to help entity coreference, and vice versa. In a cross-document domain with comparable documents, joint coreference resolution performs significantly better (over 3 CoNLL F1 points) than two strong baselines that resolve entities and events separately.</p><p>4 0.056931145 <a title="9-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Building_a_Lightweight_Semantic_Model_for_Unsupervised_Information_Extraction_on_Short_Listings.html">26 emnlp-2012-Building a Lightweight Semantic Model for Unsupervised Information Extraction on Short Listings</a></p>
<p>Author: Doo Soon Kim ; Kunal Verma ; Peter Yeh</p><p>Abstract: Short listings such as classified ads or product listings abound on the web. If a computer can reliably extract information from them, it will greatly benefit a variety of applications. Short listings are, however, challenging to process due to their informal styles. In this paper, we present an unsupervised information extraction system for short listings. Given a corpus of listings, the system builds a semantic model that represents typical objects and their attributes in the domain of the corpus, and then uses the model to extract information. Two key features in the system are a semantic parser that extracts objects and their attributes and a listing-focused clustering module that helps group together extracted tokens of same type. Our evaluation shows that the , semantic model learned by these two modules is effective across multiple domains.</p><p>5 0.054379892 <a title="9-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-No_Noun_Phrase_Left_Behind%3A_Detecting_and_Typing_Unlinkable_Entities.html">98 emnlp-2012-No Noun Phrase Left Behind: Detecting and Typing Unlinkable Entities</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Lin ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Entity linking systems link noun-phrase mentions in text to their corresponding Wikipedia articles. However, NLP applications would gain from the ability to detect and type all entities mentioned in text, including the long tail of entities not prominent enough to have their own Wikipedia articles. In this paper we show that once the Wikipedia entities mentioned in a corpus of textual assertions are linked, this can further enable the detection and fine-grained typing of the unlinkable entities. Our proposed method for detecting unlinkable entities achieves 24% greater accuracy than a Named Entity Recognition baseline, and our method for fine-grained typing is able to propagate over 1,000 types from linked Wikipedia entities to unlinkable entities. Detection and typing of unlinkable entities can increase yield for NLP applications such as typed question answering.</p><p>6 0.05391641 <a title="9-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning-based_Multi-Sieve_Co-reference_Resolution_with_Knowledge.html">76 emnlp-2012-Learning-based Multi-Sieve Co-reference Resolution with Knowledge</a></p>

<p>Author: Vera Demberg ; Asad Sayeed ; Philip Gorinski ; Nikolaos Engonopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present results of a novel experiment to investigate speech production in conversational data that links speech rate to information density. We provide the first evidence for an association between syntactic surprisal and word duration in recorded speech. Using the AMI corpus which contains transcriptions of focus group meetings with precise word durations, we show that word durations correlate with syntactic surprisal estimated from the incremental Roark parser over and above simpler measures, such as word duration estimated from a state-of-the-art text-to-speech system and word frequencies, and that the syntactic surprisal estimates are better predictors of word durations than a simpler version of surprisal based on trigram probabilities. This result supports the uniform information density (UID) hypothesis and points a way to more realistic artificial speech generation.</p><p>4 0.35156965 <a title="9-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Characterizing_Stylistic_Elements_in_Syntactic_Structure.html">27 emnlp-2012-Characterizing Stylistic Elements in Syntactic Structure</a></p>
<p>Author: Song Feng ; Ritwik Banerjee ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Much of the writing styles recognized in rhetorical and composition theories involve deep syntactic elements. However, most previous research for computational stylometric analysis has relied on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns. Some very recent work has shown that PCFG models can detect distributional difference in syntactic styles, but without offering much insights into exactly what constitute salient stylistic elements in sentence structure characterizing each authorship. In this paper, we present a comprehensive exploration of syntactic elements in writing styles, with particular emphasis on interpretable characterization of stylistic elements. We present analytic insights with respect to the authorship attribution task in two different domains. ,</p><p>5 0.33812541 <a title="9-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Coherence_Model_Based_on_Syntactic_Patterns.html">3 emnlp-2012-A Coherence Model Based on Syntactic Patterns</a></p>

<p>Author: David Hall ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: PCFGs can grow exponentially as additional annotations are added to an initially simple base grammar. We present an approach where multiple annotations coexist, but in a factored manner that avoids this combinatorial explosion. Our method works with linguisticallymotivated annotations, induced latent structure, lexicalization, or any mix of the three. We use a structured expectation propagation algorithm that makes use of the factored structure in two ways. First, by partitioning the factors, it speeds up parsing exponentially over the unfactored approach. Second, it minimizes the redundancy of the factors during training, improving accuracy over an independent approach. Using purely latent variable annotations, we can efficiently train and parse with up to 8 latent bits per symbol, achieving F1 scores up to 88.4 on the Penn Treebank while using two orders of magnitudes fewer parameters compared to the na¨ ıve approach. Combining latent, lexicalized, and unlexicalized anno- tations, our best parser gets 89.4 F1 on all sentences from section 23 of the Penn Treebank.</p><p>2 0.92201954 <a title="9-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2012-Syntactic_Transfer_Using_a_Bilingual_Lexicon.html">123 emnlp-2012-Syntactic Transfer Using a Bilingual Lexicon</a></p>
<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Adam Pauls ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of using a bilingual dictionary to transfer lexico-syntactic information from a resource-rich source language to a resource-poor target language. In contrast to past work that used bitexts to transfer analyses of specific sentences at the token level, we instead use features to transfer the behavior of words at a type level. In a discriminative dependency parsing framework, our approach produces gains across a range of target languages, using two different lowresource training methodologies (one weakly supervised and one indirectly supervised) and two different dictionary sources (one manually constructed and one automatically constructed).</p><p>same-paper 3 0.87165368 <a title="9-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Sequence_Labelling_Approach_to_Quote_Attribution.html">9 emnlp-2012-A Sequence Labelling Approach to Quote Attribution</a></p>
<p>Author: Timothy O'Keefe ; Silvia Pareti ; James R. Curran ; Irena Koprinska ; Matthew Honnibal</p><p>Abstract: Quote extraction and attribution is the task of automatically extracting quotes from text and attributing each quote to its correct speaker. The present state-of-the-art system uses gold standard information from previous decisions in its features, which, when removed, results in a large drop in performance. We treat the problem as a sequence labelling task, which allows us to incorporate sequence features without using gold standard information. We present results on two new corpora and an augmented version of a third, achieving a new state-of-the-art for systems using only realistic features.</p><p>4 0.85574579 <a title="9-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-N-gram-based_Tense_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">95 emnlp-2012-N-gram-based Tense Models for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengxian Gong ; Min Zhang ; Chew Lim Tan ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Tense is a small element to a sentence, however, error tense can raise odd grammars and result in misunderstanding. Recently, tense has drawn attention in many natural language processing applications. However, most of current Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems mainly depend on translation model and language model. They never consider and make full use of tense information. In this paper, we propose n-gram-based tense models for SMT and successfully integrate them into a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system via two additional features. Experimental results on the NIST Chinese-English translation task show that our proposed tense models are very effective, contributing performance improvement by 0.62 BLUE points over a strong baseline. 1</p><p>5 0.73946035 <a title="9-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_Verb_Inference_Rules_from_Linguistically-Motivated_Evidence.html">80 emnlp-2012-Learning Verb Inference Rules from Linguistically-Motivated Evidence</a></p>
<p>Author: Hila Weisman ; Jonathan Berant ; Idan Szpektor ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: Learning inference relations between verbs is at the heart of many semantic applications. However, most prior work on learning such rules focused on a rather narrow set of information sources: mainly distributional similarity, and to a lesser extent manually constructed verb co-occurrence patterns. In this paper, we claim that it is imperative to utilize information from various textual scopes: verb co-occurrence within a sentence, verb cooccurrence within a document, as well as overall corpus statistics. To this end, we propose a much richer novel set of linguistically motivated cues for detecting entailment between verbs and combine them as features in a supervised classification framework. We empirically demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous methods and that information from each textual scope contributes to the verb entailment learning task.</p><p>6 0.67495918 <a title="9-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-An_%22AI_readability%22_Formula_for_French_as_a_Foreign_Language.html">17 emnlp-2012-An "AI readability" Formula for French as a Foreign Language</a></p>

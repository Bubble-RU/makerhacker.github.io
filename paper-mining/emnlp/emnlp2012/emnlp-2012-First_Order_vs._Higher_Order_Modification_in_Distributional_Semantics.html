<p>Author: William Blacoe ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of modeling compositional meaning for phrases and sentences using distributional methods. We experiment with several possible combinations of representation and composition, exhibiting varying degrees of sophistication. Some are shallow while others operate over syntactic structure, rely on parameter learning, or require access to very large corpora. We find that shallow approaches are as good as more computationally intensive alternatives with regards to two particular tests: (1) phrase similarity and (2) paraphrase detection. The sizes of the involved training corpora and the generated vectors are not as important as the fit between the meaning representation and compositional method.</p><p>3 0.23757832 <a title="53-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Semantic_Compositionality_through_Recursive_Matrix-Vector_Spaces.html">116 emnlp-2012-Semantic Compositionality through Recursive Matrix-Vector Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Brody Huval ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Single-word vector space models have been very successful at learning lexical information. However, they cannot capture the compositional meaning of longer phrases, preventing them from a deeper understanding of language. We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between nouns using the syntactic path between them.</p><p>4 0.066495627 <a title="53-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_Syntactic_Categories_Using_Paradigmatic_Representations_of_Word_Context.html">79 emnlp-2012-Learning Syntactic Categories Using Paradigmatic Representations of Word Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Kang Liu ; Liheng Xu ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to extract opinion targets based on wordbased translation model (WTM). At first, we apply WTM in a monolingual scenario to mine the associations between opinion targets and opinion words. Then, a graphbased algorithm is exploited to extract opinion targets, where candidate opinion relevance estimated from the mined associations, is incorporated with candidate importance to generate a global measure. By using WTM, our method can capture opinion relations more precisely, especially for long-span relations. In particular, compared with previous syntax-based methods, our method can effectively avoid noises from parsing errors when dealing with informal texts in large Web corpora. By using graph-based algorithm, opinion targets are extracted in a global process, which can effectively alleviate the problem of error propagation in traditional bootstrap-based methods, such as Double Propagation. The experimental results on three real world datasets in different sizes and languages show that our approach is more effective and robust than state-of-art methods. 1</p><p>6 0.062811784 <a title="53-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Polarity_Inducing_Latent_Semantic_Analysis.html">107 emnlp-2012-Polarity Inducing Latent Semantic Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Carina Silberer ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: A popular tradition of studying semantic representation has been driven by the assumption that word meaning can be learned from the linguistic environment, despite ample evidence suggesting that language is grounded in perception and action. In this paper we present a comparative study of models that represent word meaning based on linguistic and perceptual data. Linguistic information is approximated by naturally occurring corpora and sensorimotor experience by feature norms (i.e., attributes native speakers consider important in describing the meaning of a word). The models differ in terms of the mechanisms by which they integrate the two modalities. Experimental results show that a closer correspondence to human data can be obtained by uncovering latent information shared among the textual and perceptual modalities rather than arriving at semantic knowledge by concatenating the two.</p><p>5 0.41415304 <a title="53-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Polarity_Inducing_Latent_Semantic_Analysis.html">107 emnlp-2012-Polarity Inducing Latent Semantic Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-tau Yih ; Geoffrey Zweig ; John Platt</p><p>Abstract: Existing vector space models typically map synonyms and antonyms to similar word vectors, and thus fail to represent antonymy. We introduce a new vector space representation where antonyms lie on opposite sides of a sphere: in the word vector space, synonyms have cosine similarities close to one, while antonyms are close to minus one. We derive this representation with the aid of a thesaurus and latent semantic analysis (LSA). Each entry in the thesaurus a word sense along with its synonyms and antonyms is treated as a “document,” and the resulting document collection is subjected to LSA. The key contribution of this work is to show how to assign signs to the entries in the co-occurrence matrix on which LSA operates, so as to induce a subspace with the desired property. – – We evaluate this procedure with the Graduate Record Examination questions of (Mohammed et al., 2008) and find that the method improves on the results of that study. Further improvements result from refining the subspace representation with discriminative training, and augmenting the training data with general newspaper text. Altogether, we improve on the best previous results by 11points absolute in F measure.</p><p>6 0.35191461 <a title="53-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_Syntactic_Categories_Using_Paradigmatic_Representations_of_Word_Context.html">79 emnlp-2012-Learning Syntactic Categories Using Paradigmatic Representations of Word Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Altaf Rahman ; Vincent Ng</p><p>Abstract: We examine the task of resolving complex cases of definite pronouns, specifically those for which traditional linguistic constraints on coreference (e.g., Binding Constraints, gender and number agreement) as well as commonly-used resolution heuristics (e.g., string-matching facilities, syntactic salience) are not useful. Being able to solve this task has broader implications in artificial intelligence: a restricted version of it, sometimes referred to as the Winograd Schema Challenge, has been suggested as a conceptually and practically appealing alternative to the Turing Test. We employ a knowledge-rich approach to this task, which yields a pronoun resolver that outperforms state-of-the-art resolvers by nearly 18 points in accuracy on our dataset.</p><p>3 0.72138512 <a title="53-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_Syntactic_Categories_Using_Paradigmatic_Representations_of_Word_Context.html">79 emnlp-2012-Learning Syntactic Categories Using Paradigmatic Representations of Word Context</a></p>

Our results show that (a) the model outperforms the strong adjacent-sentence baseline; (b) general abstract-anaphora features, as distinguished from issue-specific features, play a crucial role in this-issue anaphora resolution, suggesting that our approach can be generalized for other NPs such as this problem and this debate; and (c) it is possible to reduce the search space in order to improve performance.</p><p>5 0.54629123 <a title="53-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Comparison_of_Vector-based_Representations_for_Semantic_Composition.html">4 emnlp-2012-A Comparison of Vector-based Representations for Semantic Composition</a></p>
<p>Author: William Blacoe ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of modeling compositional meaning for phrases and sentences using distributional methods. We experiment with several possible combinations of representation and composition, exhibiting varying degrees of sophistication. Some are shallow while others operate over syntactic structure, rely on parameter learning, or require access to very large corpora. We find that shallow approaches are as good as more computationally intensive alternatives with regards to two particular tests: (1) phrase similarity and (2) paraphrase detection. The sizes of the involved training corpora and the generated vectors are not as important as the fit between the meaning representation and compositional method.</p><p>6 0.53206521 <a title="53-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Semantic_Compositionality_through_Recursive_Matrix-Vector_Spaces.html">116 emnlp-2012-Semantic Compositionality through Recursive Matrix-Vector Spaces</a></p>

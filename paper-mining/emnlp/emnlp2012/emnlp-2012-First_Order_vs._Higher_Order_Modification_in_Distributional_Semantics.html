</p><p>2 Abstract Adjectival modification, particularly by expressions that have been treated as higherorder modifiers in the formal semantics tradition, raises interesting challenges for semantic composition in distributional semantic models. [sent-8, score-0.461]
</p><p>3 Higher-order modification (that is, modification that cannot obviously be modeled as property intersection, in contrast to firstorder modification, which can) presents one such challenge, as we will detail in the next section. [sent-20, score-0.367]

</p><p>5 Second, we test how five different composition functions that have been proposed in recent literature fare in predicting the attested properties of nominals modified by each type of adjective. [sent-32, score-0.284]
</p><p>6 Section 4 describes the characteristics of the different types of adjectival modification, and Section 5, the results of the composition operations. [sent-37, score-0.265]
</p><p>7 2  The semantics of adjectival modification  Accounting for inference in language is an important concern of semantic theory. [sent-39, score-0.321]
</p><p>8 Perhaps for this reason, within the formal semantics tradition the most influential classification of adjectives is based on the inferences they license (see (Parsons, 1970) and (Kamp, 1975) for early discussion). [sent-40, score-0.33]
</p><p>9 First, so called intersective adjectives, such as (the literally used) white in white dress, yield the inference that both the property contributed by the adjective and that contributed by the noun hold of the individual described; in other words, a white dress is white and is a dress. [sent-42, score-1.55]
</p><p>10 On the other extreme, intensional adjectives, such as former or alleged in former/alleged criminal, do not license the inference that either of the properties holds of the individual to which the modified nom1224 inal is ascribed. [sent-44, score-0.415]
</p><p>11 Finally, subsective adjectives such as (the nonliterally-used) white in white wine, consitute an intermediate case: they license the inference that the  property denoted by the noun holds of the individual being described, but not the property contributed by the adjective. [sent-51, score-1.108]
</p><p>12 That is, white wine is not white but rather a color that we would probably call some shade of yellow. [sent-52, score-0.814]
</p><p>13 This use of color terms, in general, is distinguished primarily by the fact that color serves as a proxy for another property that is related to color (e. [sent-53, score-1.001]
</p><p>14 type of grape), though the color in question may or may not match the color identified by the adjective on the intersective use (see (G¨ ardenfors, 2000) and (Kennedy and McNally, 2010) for discussion and analysis). [sent-55, score-1.266]
</p><p>15 This use of color terms can be modeled by property intersection in formal semantic models only if the term is previously disambiguated or allowed to depend on context for its precise denotation. [sent-58, score-0.479]
</p><p>16 However, it is easily modeled if the adjective denotes a (higher-order) function from properties (e. [sent-59, score-0.252]
</p><p>17 that denoted by wine) to properties (that denoted by white  wine), since the output of the function denoted by the color term can be made to depend on the input it receives from the noun meaning. [sent-61, score-0.614]
</p><p>18 Nonetheless, there is ample evidence in natural language that a firstorder analysis of the subsective color terms would be preferable, as they share more features with predicative adjectives such as happy than they do with adjectives such as former. [sent-62, score-1.151]
</p><p>19 The trio of intersective color terms, subsective color terms, and intensional adjectives provides fertile ground for exploring the different composition functions that have been proposed for distributional semantic representations. [sent-63, score-2.318]
</p><p>20 Most of these functions start from the assumption that composition takes pairs of vectors (e. [sent-64, score-0.347]
</p><p>21 Such functions, insofar as they yield representations which strengthen distributional features shared by the component vectors, would be expected to model intersective modification. [sent-69, score-0.555]
</p><p>22 Combining the two vectors with an additive or multiplicative operation should rightly yield a vector for white dress which assigns a higher frequency to wedding than to funeral. [sent-76, score-0.55]
</p><p>23 Additive and multiplicative functions might also be expected to handle subsective modification with some success because these operations provide a natural account for how polysemy is resolved in meaning composition. [sent-77, score-0.7]
</p><p>24 Thus, the vector that results from adding or multiplying the vector for white with that for dress should differ in crucial features from the one that results from combining the same vector for white with that for wine. [sent-78, score-0.618]
</p><p>25 In contrast, it is not immedi-  ately obvious how these operations would fare with intensional adjectives such as former. [sent-80, score-0.578]
</p><p>26 In particular, it is not clear what specific distributional features of the adjective would capture the effect that the ad1225 jective has on the meaning of the resulting modified nominal. [sent-81, score-0.292]
</p><p>27 On such models, the distributional properties of observed occurrences of adjective-noun pairs are used to induce the effect of adjectives on nouns. [sent-83, score-0.329]
</p><p>28 There is also no a priori reason to think that it would fare more poorly at modeling the intersective and subsective adjectives than would additive or multiplicative analyses, given its generality. [sent-85, score-1.118]
</p><p>29 3  Method  We built a semantic space and tested the composition functions as specified in what follows. [sent-87, score-0.288]
</p><p>30 2 Vocabulary The core vocabulary of the semantic space consists of the 8K most frequent nouns and the 4K most frequent adjectives from the corpus. [sent-108, score-0.292]
</p><p>31 For each function, we define p as the composition of the adjective vector, u, and the noun vector, v, a nomenclature that follows Mitchell and Lapata (2010). [sent-127, score-0.432]
</p><p>32 Additive (add) AN vectors were obtained by summing the corresponding adjective and noun vectors. [sent-128, score-0.383]
</p><p>33 We also explored the effects of the additive model with normalized component adjective and noun vectors (addn). [sent-129, score-0.458]
</p><p>34 p = u+ v  (2)  Multiplicative (mult) AN vectors were obtained by component-wise multiplication of the adjective and noun vectors in the non-reduced semantic space. [sent-130, score-0.571]
</p><p>35 An AN vector is obtained by multiplying the weight matrix by the concatenation of the adjective and noun vectors, so that each dimension of the generated AN vector is a linear combination of dimensions of the corresponding adjective and noun vectors. [sent-146, score-0.707]
</p><p>36 Coefficient matrix estimation is per-  formed by feeding PLSR a set of input-output examples, where the input is given by concatenated adjective and noun vectors, and the output is the vector of the corresponding AN directly extracted from our 1227 semantic space. [sent-150, score-0.382]
</p><p>37 The linear equation coefficients are estimated again using PLSR, and in the present implementation we use ridge regression generalized cross-validation (GCV) to automatically choose the optimal ridge parameter for each adjective (Golub et al. [sent-155, score-0.263]
</p><p>38 The model is trained on all NAN vector pairs available in the semantic space for each adjective, and range from 100 to over 1K items  across the adjectives we tested. [sent-158, score-0.295]

</p><p>43 7 There were too few instances of idioms (17) for a quantitative analysis of the sort presented here, so these are collapsed with the subsective class in what follows. [sent-196, score-0.395]
</p><p>44 8 The dataset as used here consists of 239 intersective and 130 subsective ANs. [sent-197, score-0.812]
</p><p>45 The intensional dataset contains all ANs in the semantic space with a preselected list of 10 intensional adjectives, manually pruned by one of the authors of the paper to eliminate erroneous examples and to ensure that the adjective was being intensionally used. [sent-199, score-0.918]
</p><p>46 9Alleged, one ofthe most prototypical intensional adjectives, is not considered here because it was not among the 700 most frequent adjectives in the space. [sent-220, score-0.547]

[sent-222, score-0.745]
</p><p>48 4  Observed vectors  We began by exploring the empirically observed vectors for the adjectives (A), nouns (N), and adjective-noun phrases (AN) in the datasets, as they are represented in the semantic space. [sent-223, score-0.546]
</p><p>49 Note that we are working with the AN vectors directly harvested from the corpora (that is, based on the cooccurrence of, say, the phrase white towel with each of the 10K words in the space dimensions), without doing any composition. [sent-224, score-0.371]
</p><p>50 AN vectors obtained by composition will be examined in the following section. [sent-225, score-0.289]
</p><p>51 Figure 1 shows the distribution of the cosines between A, N, and AN vectors with intensional adjectives (I, white box), intersective uses of color terms (IE, lighter gray box), and subsective uses of color terms (S, darker gray box). [sent-227, score-2.414]
</p><p>52 We find significant differences between the three types of adjectives in the similarity between AN and A vectors (middle graph of Figure 1). [sent-231, score-0.309]
</p><p>53 The adjective and adjective-noun phrase vectors are nearer for 10The frequency of the adjectives in the datasets range from 3. [sent-232, score-0.506]
</p><p>54 We report the cosines between the component adjective and noun vectors (cos(A,N)), between the observed AN and adjective vectors (cos(AN,A)), and between the observed AN and noun vectors (cos(AN,N)). [sent-241, score-1.063]
</p><p>55 Each chart contains three boxplots with the distribution of the cosine scores (y-axis) for the intensional (I), intersective (IE), and subsective (S) types of ANs. [sent-242, score-1.187]
</p><p>56 intersective uses than for subsective uses of color terms, a pattern that parallels the difference in the distance between component A and N vectors. [sent-249, score-1.171]
</p><p>57 As for intensional adjectives, the middle graph shows that their AN vectors are quite distant from the corresponding A vectors, in sharp contrast to what we find with both intersective and subsective –  1229 color terms. [sent-252, score-1.588]
</p><p>58 We hypothesize that the results for the intensional adjectives are due to the fact that they cannot plausibly be modeled as first order attributes (i. [sent-253, score-0.545]
</p><p>59 being potential or apparent is not a property in the same sense that being white or yellow is) and thus typically do not restrict the nominal description per se, but rather provide information about whether or when the nominal description applies. [sent-255, score-0.308]
</p><p>60 The result is that intensional adjectives should be even weaker than subsectively used adjectives, in comparison with the nouns with which they combine, in their ability to “pull” the AN vector in their direction. [sent-256, score-0.628]
</p><p>61 An examination of the average distances among the nearest neighbors of the intensional and of the color adjectives in the distributional space supports our hypothesized account of their contrasting behaviors. [sent-259, score-0.996]
</p><p>62 We predict that the nearest neighbors are more dispersed for adjectives that cannot be modeled as first-order properties (i. [sent-260, score-0.298]
</p><p>63 , intensional adjectives), than for those that can (here, the color terms). [sent-262, score-0.656]
</p><p>64 We find that the average cosine distance among the nearest ten neighbors of the intensional adjectives is 0. [sent-263, score-0.596]
</p><p>65 001) than the average similarity among the nearest neighbors of the color adjectives, 0. [sent-266, score-0.38]
</p><p>66 Finally, with respect to the distances between the adjective-noun and head noun vectors (right graph of Figure 1), there is no significant difference for the intersective vs. [sent-269, score-0.603]
</p><p>67 This can be explained by the fact that both kinds of modifiers are subsective, that is, the fact that a white dress is a dress and that white wine is wine. [sent-271, score-0.701]
</p><p>68 In contrast, intensional ANs are closer to their component Ns than are color ANs (the difference is qualitatively quite small, but significant even for the intersective vs. [sent-272, score-1.106]
</p><p>69 intensional ANs according to a  t-test, p-value = 0. [sent-273, score-0.33]
</p><p>70 This effect, the inverse of what we find with the AN-A vectors, can similarly be explained by the fact that intensional adjectives do not restrict the descriptive content of the noun they modify, in contrast to both the intersective and subsective color ANs. [sent-275, score-1.723]
</p><p>71 Finally, note that, contrary to predictions from some approaches in formal semantics, subsective color ANs and intensional ANs do not pattern together: subsective ANs are closer to their component As, and intensional ANs closer to their component Ns. [sent-279, score-1.884]
</p><p>72 5  Composed vectors  Since intersective modification is the point of comparison for both subsective and intensional modification, we first discuss the composed vectors for the intersective vs. [sent-282, score-1.972]
</p><p>73 subsective uses of color terms, and then turn to intersective vs. [sent-283, score-1.138]
</p><p>74 Table 2 provides a summary of the results with  the observed data (obs) and the composition functions discussed in Section 3. [sent-287, score-0.266]
</p><p>75 It is computed by finding the cosine between the composed AN vectors and all rows in the semantic space and then determining the rank in which the observed ANs are found. [sent-290, score-0.27]
</p><p>76 11 The remaining columns report the differences in standardized (z-score) cosines between the vector built with each of the composition functions and the observed AN, A, and N vectors. [sent-291, score-0.377]
</p><p>77 A positive value means that the cosines for intersective uses are higher, while a negative value means that the cosines for subsective uses are higher. [sent-292, score-0.944]
</p><p>78 The first column reports the rank of the observed equivalent (ROE), the rest report the differences (∆) betwen the intersective and subsective uses ofcolor terms when comparing the composed AN with the observed vectors for: AN, adjective (A), noun (N). [sent-296, score-1.326]
</p><p>79 In both cases, we find that these functions yield higher similarities for AN-A for the intersective than for the subsective uses of color terms, and a very slight (though still mildly significant) difference for the distance to the head noun. [sent-303, score-1.196]
</p><p>80 This suggests that, for adjectival modification, providing a vector that is in the middle of the two component vectors (which is what normalized addition does) is a reasonable approximation of the observed vectors. [sent-305, score-0.333]
</p><p>81 The non-normalized version also cannot account for these effects because the adjective vector, being much longer (as color terms are very frequent), totally dominates the AN, which results in no difference across uses when comparing to the adjective or to the noun. [sent-307, score-0.746]
</p><p>82 A possible explanation for the ANA results is that lim learns from such a broad range of AN pairs that the impact of the distance between intersective vs. [sent-310, score-0.478]
</p><p>83 subsective uses of color terms from their component adjectives is dampened. [sent-311, score-0.969]
</p><p>84 All composition functions except for alm find intersective uses easier to model. [sent-313, score-0.798]
</p><p>85 This is shown in the positive values in column ∆:AN, which mean that the similarity between observed and composed AN vectors is greater for intersective than for subsective ANs. [sent-314, score-0.998]
</p><p>86 The subsective uses are specific to the nouns with which the color terms combine, and the exact interpretation of the adjective varies across those nouns. [sent-316, score-1.011]
</p><p>87 In contrast, the interpretation associated with intersective use is consistent across a larger variety of nouns, and in that sense should be predominantly reflected in the adjective’s vector. [sent-317, score-0.442]
</p><p>88 And indeed, alm is the  only function that shows no difference in difficulty (distance) between the predicted and observed AN vectors for intersective vs. [sent-319, score-0.73]
</p><p>89 Both mult and alm seem to account for the observed patterns in color terms. [sent-321, score-0.545]
</p><p>90 However, an examination of the nearest neighbors of the composed ANs suggest that alm captures the semantics of adjective composition in this case to a larger extent than mult. [sent-322, score-0.644]
</p><p>91 For instance, the NN for blue square (intersective) are the following according to mul: blue, red, official colour, traditional colour, blue number, yellow; while alm yields the following: blue square, red square, blue circle, blue triangle, blue pattern, yellow circle. [sent-323, score-0.543]
</p><p>92 Similarly, for green politics (subsective) mul yields: pleasant land, green business, green politics, green issue, green strategy, green product, while alm yields green politics, green movement, political agenda, environmental movement, progressive government, political initiative. [sent-324, score-0.851]
</p><p>93 2 Intensional modification Table 3 contains the results of the composition functions comparing the behavior of intersective color ANs and intensional ANs. [sent-326, score-1.446]
</p><p>94 As noted above, we expect more difficulty in modeling intensional modification vs. [sent-334, score-0.476]
</p><p>95 The difference with the results in the previous subsection is that in this case the alm function does present a higher difficulty in modeling intensional ANs, unlike with the color terms. [sent-337, score-0.81]
</p><p>96 This points to a qualitative difference between subsective and intensional adjectives that could be evidence for a first-order analysis of subsective color terms. [sent-338, score-1.635]
</p><p>97 Again, alm seems to be capturing relevant semantic aspects of composition with intensional adjectives. [sent-344, score-0.689]
</p><p>98 Our results also show that alm performs better than lim, but it is worth observing that it does so at the expense of modeling each adjective as a completely different function. [sent-348, score-0.351]
</p><p>99 However, the linguistic literature and the present results suggest that it might be useful to try a compromise between alm and lim, training one matrix for each subclass of adjectives under analysis. [sent-352, score-0.381]
</p><p>100 Beyond the new data it offers regarding the comparative ability of the different composition functions to account for different kinds of adjectival modification, the study presented here underscores the complexity of modification as a semantic phenomenon. [sent-353, score-0.527]

<p>Author: William Blacoe ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of modeling compositional meaning for phrases and sentences using distributional methods. We experiment with several possible combinations of representation and composition, exhibiting varying degrees of sophistication.

<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Brody Huval ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Single-word vector space models have been very successful at learning lexical information. However, they cannot capture the compositional meaning of longer phrases, preventing them from a deeper understanding of language. We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language.

<p>Author: Mathias Verbeke ; Vincent Van Asch ; Roser Morante ; Paolo Frasconi ; Walter Daelemans ; Luc De Raedt</p><p>Abstract: Evidence-based medicine is an approach whereby clinical decisions are supported by the best available findings gained from scientific research. This requires efficient access to such evidence. To this end, abstracts in evidence-based medicine can be labeled using a set of predefined medical categories, the socalled PICO criteria. This paper presents an approach to automatically annotate sentences in medical abstracts with these labels. Since both structural and sequential information are important for this classification task, we use kLog, a new language for statistical relational learning with kernels. Our results show a clear improvement with respect to state-of-the-art systems.</p><p>6 0.047639858 <a title="53-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Fast_Large-Scale_Approximate_Graph_Construction_for_NLP.html">52 emnlp-2012-Fast Large-Scale Approximate Graph Construction for NLP</a></p>

<p>Author: Wen-tau Yih ; Geoffrey Zweig ; John Platt</p><p>Abstract: Existing vector space models typically map synonyms and antonyms to similar word vectors, and thus fail to represent antonymy. We introduce a new vector space representation where antonyms lie on opposite sides of a sphere: in the word vector space, synonyms have cosine similarities close to one, while antonyms are close to minus one. We derive this representation with the aid of a thesaurus and latent semantic analysis (LSA). Each entry in the thesaurus a word sense along with its synonyms and antonyms is treated as a “document,” and the resulting document collection is subjected to LSA. The key contribution of this work is to show how to assign signs to the entries in the co-occurrence matrix on which LSA operates, so as to induce a subspace with the desired property. – – We evaluate this procedure with the Graduate Record Examination questions of (Mohammed et al., 2008) and find that the method improves on the results of that study. Further improvements result from refining the subspace representation with discriminative training, and augmenting the training data with general newspaper text. Altogether, we improve on the best previous results by 11points absolute in F measure.</p><p>6 0.35617384 <a title="53-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Statistical_Relational_Learning_Approach_to_Identifying_Evidence_Based_Medicine_Categories.html">10 emnlp-2012-A Statistical Relational Learning Approach to Identifying Evidence Based Medicine Categories</a></p>

<p>Author: Bonan Min ; Shuming Shi ; Ralph Grishman ; Chin-Yew Lin</p><p>Abstract: Discovering significant types of relations from the web is challenging because of its open nature. Unsupervised algorithms are developed to extract relations from a corpus without knowing the relations in advance, but most of them rely on tagging arguments of predefined types. Recently, a new algorithm was proposed to jointly extract relations and their argument semantic classes, taking a set of relation instances extracted by an open IE algorithm as input. However, it cannot handle polysemy of relation phrases and fails to group many similar (“synonymous”) relation instances because of the sparseness of features. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised algorithm that provides a more general treatment of the polysemy and synonymy problems. The algorithm incorporates various knowledge sources which we will show to be very effective for unsupervised extraction. Moreover, it explicitly disambiguates polysemous relation phrases and groups synonymous ones. While maintaining approximately the same precision, the algorithm achieves significant improvement on recall compared to the previous method. It is also very efficient. Experiments on a realworld dataset show that it can handle 14.7 million relation instances and extract a very large set of relations from the web.

The web has become a massive potential source of such relations. However, its open nature brings an open-ended set of relation types. To extract these relations, a system should not assume a fixed set of relation types, nor rely on a fixed set of relation argument types. The past decade has seen some promising solutions, unsupervised relation extraction (URE) algorithms that extract relations from a corpus without knowing the relations in advance. However, most algorithms (Hasegawa et al., 2004, Shinyama and Sekine, 2006, Chen et. al, 2005) rely on tagging predefined types of entities as relation arguments, and thus are not well-suited for the open domain. Recently, Kok and Domingos (2008) proposed Semantic Network Extractor (SNE), which generates argument semantic classes and sets of synonymous relation phrases at the same time, thus avoiding the requirement of tagging relation arguments of predefined types. However, SNE has 2 limitations: 1) Following previous URE algorithms, it only uses features from the set of input relation instances for clustering. Empirically we found that it fails to group many relevant relation instances. These features, such as the surface forms of arguments and lexical sequences in between, are very sparse in practice. In contrast, there exist several well-known corpus-level semantic resources that can be automatically derived from a source corpus and are shown to be useful for generating the key elements of a relation: its 2 argument semantic classes and a set of synonymous phrases. For example, semantic classes can be derived from a source corpus with contextual distributional simi1 Introduction Relation extraction aims at discovering semantic larity and web table co-occurrences.

<p>Author: Jayant Krishnamurthy ; Tom Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for training a semantic parser using only a knowledge base and an unlabeled text corpus, without any individually annotated sentences. Our key observation is that multiple forms ofweak supervision can be combined to train an accurate semantic parser: semantic supervision from a knowledge base, and syntactic supervision from dependencyparsed sentences. We apply our approach to train a semantic parser that uses 77 relations from Freebase in its knowledge representation. This semantic parser extracts instances of binary relations with state-of-theart accuracy, while simultaneously recovering much richer semantic structures, such as conjunctions of multiple relations with partially shared arguments. We demonstrate recovery of this richer structure by extracting logical forms from natural language queries against Freebase. On this task, the trained semantic parser achieves 80% precision and 56% recall, despite never having seen an annotated logical form.</p><p>5 0.51403075 <a title="53-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Constructing_Task-Specific_Taxonomies_for_Document_Collection_Browsing.html">30 emnlp-2012-Constructing Task-Specific Taxonomies for Document Collection Browsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Hui Yang</p><p>Abstract: Taxonomies can serve as browsing tools for document collections. However, given an arbitrary collection, pre-constructed taxonomies could not easily adapt to the specific topic/task present in the collection. This paper explores techniques to quickly derive task-specific taxonomies supporting browsing in arbitrary document collections. The supervised approach directly learns semantic distances from users to propose meaningful task-specific taxonomies. The approach aims to produce globally optimized taxonomy structures by incorporating path consistency control and usergenerated task specification into the general learning framework. A comparison to stateof-the-art systems and a user study jointly demonstrate that our techniques are highly effective. .</p><p>6 0.44299564 <a title="53-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-No_Noun_Phrase_Left_Behind%3A_Detecting_and_Typing_Unlinkable_Entities.html">98 emnlp-2012-No Noun Phrase Left Behind: Detecting and Typing Unlinkable Entities</a></p>

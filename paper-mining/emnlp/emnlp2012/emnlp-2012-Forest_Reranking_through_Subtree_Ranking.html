<p>Author: Hao Zhang ; Ryan McDonald</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art graph-based parsers use features over higher-order dependencies that rely on decoding algorithms that are slow and difficult to generalize. On the other hand, transition-based dependency parsers can easily utilize such features without increasing the linear complexity of the shift-reduce system beyond a constant. In this paper, we attempt to address this imbalance for graph-based parsing by generalizing the Eisner (1996) algorithm to handle arbitrary features over higherorder dependencies. The generalization is at the cost of asymptotic efficiency. To account for this, cube pruning for decoding is utilized (Chiang, 2007). For the first time, label tuple and structural features such as valencies can be scored efficiently with third-order features in a graph-based parser. Our parser achieves the state-of-art unlabeled accuracy of 93.06% and labeled accuracy of 91.86% on the standard test set for English, at a faster speed than a reimplementation ofthe third-ordermodel of Koo et al. (2010).</p><p>4 0.11016744 <a title="55-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Inducing_a_Discriminative_Parser_to_Optimize_Machine_Translation_Reordering.html">67 emnlp-2012-Inducing a Discriminative Parser to Optimize Machine Translation Reordering</a></p>
<p>Author: Graham Neubig ; Taro Watanabe ; Shinsuke Mori</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for learning a discriminative parser for machine translation reordering using only aligned parallel text. This is done by treating the parser’s derivation tree as a latent variable in a model that is trained to maximize reordering accuracy. We demonstrate that efficient large-margin training is possible by showing that two measures of reordering accuracy can be factored over the parse tree. Using this model in the pre-ordering framework results in significant gains in translation accuracy over standard phrasebased SMT and previously proposed unsupervised syntax induction methods.</p><p>5 0.099882588 <a title="55-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Transition-Based_System_for_Joint_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_and_Labeled_Non-Projective_Dependency_Parsing.html">12 emnlp-2012-A Transition-Based System for Joint Part-of-Speech Tagging and Labeled Non-Projective Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernd Bohnet ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: Most current dependency parsers presuppose that input words have been morphologically disambiguated using a part-of-speech tagger before parsing begins. We present a transitionbased system for joint part-of-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with nonprojective trees. Experimental evaluation on Chinese, Czech, English and German shows consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy when compared to a pipeline system, which lead to improved state-of-theart results for all languages.</p><p>6 0.095647223 <a title="55-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Left-to-Right_Tree-to-String_Decoding_with_Prediction.html">82 emnlp-2012-Left-to-Right Tree-to-String Decoding with Prediction</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexander Rush ; Roi Reichart ; Michael Collins ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art statistical parsers and POS taggers perform very well when trained with large amounts of in-domain data. When training data is out-of-domain or limited, accuracy degrades. In this paper, we aim to compensate for the lack of available training data by exploiting similarities between test set sentences. We show how to augment sentencelevel models for parsing and POS tagging with inter-sentence consistency constraints. To deal with the resulting global objective, we present an efficient and exact dual decomposition decoding algorithm. In experiments, we add consistency constraints to the MST parser and the Stanford part-of-speech tagger and demonstrate significant error reduction in the domain adaptation and the lightly supervised settings across five languages.</p><p>5 0.35278177 <a title="55-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Spectral_Dependency_Parsing_with_Latent_Variables.html">119 emnlp-2012-Spectral Dependency Parsing with Latent Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Paramveer Dhillon ; Jordan Rodu ; Michael Collins ; Dean Foster ; Lyle Ungar</p><p>Abstract: Recently there has been substantial interest in using spectral methods to learn generative sequence models like HMMs. Spectral methods are attractive as they provide globally consistent estimates of the model parameters and are very fast and scalable, unlike EM methods, which can get stuck in local minima. In this paper, we present a novel extension of this class of spectral methods to learn dependency tree structures. We propose a simple yet powerful latent variable generative model for dependency parsing, and a spectral learning method to efficiently estimate it. As a pilot experimental evaluation, we use the spectral tree probabilities estimated by our model to re-rank the outputs of a near state-of-theart parser. Our approach gives us a moderate reduction in error of up to 4.6% over the baseline re-ranker. .</p><p>6 0.35153943 <a title="55-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Inducing_a_Discriminative_Parser_to_Optimize_Machine_Translation_Reordering.html">67 emnlp-2012-Inducing a Discriminative Parser to Optimize Machine Translation Reordering</a></p>

<p>Author: Lan Du ; Wray Buntine ; Huidong Jin</p><p>Abstract: Topic models are increasingly being used for text analysis tasks, often times replacing earlier semantic techniques such as latent semantic analysis. In this paper, we develop a novel adaptive topic model with the ability to adapt topics from both the previous segment and the parent document. For this proposed model, a Gibbs sampler is developed for doing posterior inference. Experimental results show that with topic adaptation, our model significantly improves over existing approaches in terms of perplexity, and is able to uncover clear sequential structure on, for example, Herman Melville’s book “Moby Dick”.</p><p>3 0.71997923 <a title="55-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Comparison_of_Vector-based_Representations_for_Semantic_Composition.html">4 emnlp-2012-A Comparison of Vector-based Representations for Semantic Composition</a></p>
<p>Author: William Blacoe ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of modeling compositional meaning for phrases and sentences using distributional methods. We experiment with several possible combinations of representation and composition, exhibiting varying degrees of sophistication. Some are shallow while others operate over syntactic structure, rely on parameter learning, or require access to very large corpora. We find that shallow approaches are as good as more computationally intensive alternatives with regards to two particular tests: (1) phrase similarity and (2) paraphrase detection. The sizes of the involved training corpora and the generated vectors are not as important as the fit between the meaning representation and compositional method.</p><p>4 0.59258807 <a title="55-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Parser_Showdown_at_the_Wall_Street_Corral%3A_An_Empirical_Investigation_of_Error_Types_in_Parser_Output.html">105 emnlp-2012-Parser Showdown at the Wall Street Corral: An Empirical Investigation of Error Types in Parser Output</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel Fernandez-Gonzalez ; Carlos Gomez-Rodriguez</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we show that significant improvements in the accuracy of well-known transition-based parsers can be obtained, without sacrificing efficiency, by enriching the parsers with simple transitions that act on buffer nodes. First, we show how adding a specific transition to create either a left or right arc of length one between the first two buffer nodes produces improvements in the accuracy of Nivre’s arc-eager projective parser on a number of datasets from the CoNLL-X shared task. Then, we show that accuracy can also be improved by adding transitions involving the topmost stack node and the second buffer node (allowing a limited form of non-projectivity). None of these transitions has a negative impact on the computational complexity of the algorithm. Although the experiments in this paper use the arc-eager parser, the approach is generic enough to be applicable to any stackbased dependency parser.</p><p>6 0.58681536 <a title="55-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Mixed_Membership_Markov_Models_for_Unsupervised_Conversation_Modeling.html">89 emnlp-2012-Mixed Membership Markov Models for Unsupervised Conversation Modeling</a></p>

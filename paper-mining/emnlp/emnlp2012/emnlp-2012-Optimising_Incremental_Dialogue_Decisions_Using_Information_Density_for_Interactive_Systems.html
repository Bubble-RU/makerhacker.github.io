<p>Author: Aciel Eshky ; Ben Allison ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: User simulation is frequently used to train statistical dialog managers for task-oriented domains. At present, goal-driven simulators (those that have a persistent notion of what they wish to achieve in the dialog) require some task-specific engineering, making them impossible to evaluate intrinsically. Instead, they have been evaluated extrinsically by means of the dialog managers they are intended to train, leading to circularity of argument. In this paper, we propose the first fully generative goal-driven simulator that is fully induced from data, without hand-crafting or goal annotation. Our goals are latent, and take the form of topics in a topic model, clustering together semantically equivalent and phonetically confusable strings, implicitly modelling synonymy and speech recognition noise. We evaluate on two standard dialog resources, the Communicator and Let’s Go datasets, and demonstrate that our model has substantially better fit to held out data than competing approaches. We also show that features derived from our model allow significantly greater improvement over a baseline at distinguishing real from randomly permuted dialogs.</p><p>3 0.14775285 <a title="102-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Framework_of_Automatic_Text_Summarization_Using_Reinforcement_Learning.html">56 emnlp-2012-Framework of Automatic Text Summarization Using Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Seonggi Ryang ; Takeshi Abekawa</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to the problem of automatic text summarization called Automatic Summarization using Reinforcement Learning (ASRL) in this paper, which models the process of constructing a summary within the framework of reinforcement learning and attempts to optimize the given score function with the given feature representation of a summary. We demonstrate that the method of reinforcement learning can be adapted to automatic summarization problems naturally and simply, and other summarizing techniques, such as sentence compression, can be easily adapted as actions of the framework. The experimental results indicated ASRL was superior to the best performing method in DUC2004 and comparable to the state of the art ILP-style method, in terms of ROUGE scores. The results also revealed ASRL can search for sub-optimal solutions efficiently under conditions for effectively selecting features and the score function.</p><p>4 0.13144021 <a title="102-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Word_Salad%3A_Relating_Food_Prices_and_Descriptions.html">139 emnlp-2012-Word Salad: Relating Food Prices and Descriptions</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Chahuneau ; Kevin Gimpel ; Bryan R. Routledge ; Lily Scherlis ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the use of language in food writing, specifically on restaurant menus and in customer reviews. Our approach is to build predictive models of concrete external variables, such as restaurant menu prices. We make use of a dataset of menus and customer reviews for thousands of restaurants in several U.S. cities. By focusing on prediction tasks and doing our analysis at scale, our methodology allows quantitative, objective measurements of the words and phrases used to de- scribe food in restaurants. We also explore interactions in language use between menu prices and sentiment as expressed in user reviews.</p><p>5 0.095153108 <a title="102-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Syntactic_Surprisal_Affects_Spoken_Word_Duration_in_Conversational_Contexts.html">122 emnlp-2012-Syntactic Surprisal Affects Spoken Word Duration in Conversational Contexts</a></p>
<p>Author: Vera Demberg ; Asad Sayeed ; Philip Gorinski ; Nikolaos Engonopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present results of a novel experiment to investigate speech production in conversational data that links speech rate to information density. We provide the first evidence for an association between syntactic surprisal and word duration in recorded speech. Using the AMI corpus which contains transcriptions of focus group meetings with precise word durations, we show that word durations correlate with syntactic surprisal estimated from the incremental Roark parser over and above simpler measures, such as word duration estimated from a state-of-the-art text-to-speech system and word frequencies, and that the syntactic surprisal estimates are better predictors of word durations than a simpler version of surprisal based on trigram probabilities. This result supports the uniform information density (UID) hypothesis and points a way to more realistic artificial speech generation.</p><p>6 0.092392832 <a title="102-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Concurrent_Acquisition_of_Word_Meaning_and_Lexical_Categories.html">29 emnlp-2012-Concurrent Acquisition of Word Meaning and Lexical Categories</a></p>

We introduce a novel corpus of music and lyrics, consisting of 100 songs annotated for emotions. We show that textual and musical features can both be successfully used for emotion recognition in songs. Moreover, through comparative experiments, we show that the joint use of lyrics and music brings significant improvements over each of the individual textual and musical classifiers, with error rate reductions of up to 31%.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.68430263 <a title="102-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2012-Optimising_Incremental_Dialogue_Decisions_Using_Information_Density_for_Interactive_Systems.html">102 emnlp-2012-Optimising Incremental Dialogue Decisions Using Information Density for Interactive Systems</a></p>

Our goals are latent, and take the form of topics in a topic model, clustering together semantically equivalent and phonetically confusable strings, implicitly modelling synonymy and speech recognition noise. We evaluate on two standard dialog resources, the Communicator and Let’s Go datasets, and demonstrate that our model has substantially better fit to held out data than competing approaches. We also show that features derived from our model allow significantly greater improvement over a baseline at distinguishing real from randomly permuted dialogs.</p><p>4 0.42353705 <a title="102-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning-based_Multi-Sieve_Co-reference_Resolution_with_Knowledge.html">76 emnlp-2012-Learning-based Multi-Sieve Co-reference Resolution with Knowledge</a></p>
<p>Author: Lev Ratinov ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We explore the interplay of knowledge and structure in co-reference resolution. To inject knowledge, we use a state-of-the-art system which cross-links (or “grounds”) expressions in free text to Wikipedia. We explore ways of using the resulting grounding to boost the performance of a state-of-the-art co-reference resolution system. To maximize the utility of the injected knowledge, we deploy a learningbased multi-sieve approach and develop novel entity-based features. Our end system outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 2 B3 F1 points on non-transcript portion of the ACE 2004 dataset.</p><p>5 0.41012028 <a title="102-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Exploring_Adaptor_Grammars_for_Native_Language_Identification.html">48 emnlp-2012-Exploring Adaptor Grammars for Native Language Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Sze-Meng Jojo Wong ; Mark Dras ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: The task of inferring the native language of an author based on texts written in a second language has generally been tackled as a classification problem, typically using as features a mix of n-grams over characters and part of speech tags (for small and fixed n) and unigram function words. To capture arbitrarily long n-grams that syntax-based approaches have suggested are useful, adaptor grammars have some promise. In this work we investigate their extension to identifying n-gram collocations of arbitrary length over a mix of PoS tags and words, using both maxent and induced syntactic language model approaches to classification. After presenting a new, simple baseline, we show that learned collocations used as features in a maxent model perform better still, but that the story is more mixed for the syntactic language model.</p><p>6 0.40914637 <a title="102-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Assessment_of_ESL_Learners%27_Syntactic_Competence_Based_on_Similarity_Measures.html">21 emnlp-2012-Assessment of ESL Learners' Syntactic Competence Based on Similarity Measures</a></p>

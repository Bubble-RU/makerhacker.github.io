<p>Author: Bonan Min ; Shuming Shi ; Ralph Grishman ; Chin-Yew Lin</p><p>Abstract: Discovering significant types of relations from the web is challenging because of its open nature. Unsupervised algorithms are developed to extract relations from a corpus without knowing the relations in advance, but most of them rely on tagging arguments of predefined types. Recently, a new algorithm was proposed to jointly extract relations and their argument semantic classes, taking a set of relation instances extracted by an open IE algorithm as input. However, it cannot handle polysemy of relation phrases and fails to group many similar (“synonymous”) relation instances because of the sparseness of features. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised algorithm that provides a more general treatment of the polysemy and synonymy problems. The algorithm incorporates various knowledge sources which we will show to be very effective for unsupervised extraction. Moreover, it explicitly disambiguates polysemous relation phrases and groups synonymous ones. While maintaining approximately the same precision, the algorithm achieves significant improvement on recall compared to the previous method. It is also very efficient. Experiments on a realworld dataset show that it can handle 14.7 million relation instances and extract a very large set of relations from the web.

The web has become a massive potential source of such relations. However, its open nature brings an open-ended set of relation types. To extract these relations, a system should not assume a fixed set of relation types, nor rely on a fixed set of relation argument types. The past decade has seen some promising solutions, unsupervised relation extraction (URE) algorithms that extract relations from a corpus without knowing the relations in advance. However, most algorithms (Hasegawa et al., 2004, Shinyama and Sekine, 2006, Chen et. al, 2005) rely on tagging predefined types of entities as relation arguments, and thus are not well-suited for the open domain. Recently, Kok and Domingos (2008) proposed Semantic Network Extractor (SNE), which generates argument semantic classes and sets of synonymous relation phrases at the same time, thus avoiding the requirement of tagging relation arguments of predefined types. However, SNE has 2 limitations: 1) Following previous URE algorithms, it only uses features from the set of input relation instances for clustering. Empirically we found that it fails to group many relevant relation instances. These features, such as the surface forms of arguments and lexical sequences in between, are very sparse in practice. In contrast, there exist several well-known corpus-level semantic resources that can be automatically derived from a source corpus and are shown to be useful for generating the key elements of a relation: its 2 argument semantic classes and a set of synonymous phrases. For example, semantic classes can be derived from a source corpus with contextual distributional simi1 Introduction Relation extraction aims at discovering semantic larity and web table co-occurrences.

<p>Author: William Blacoe ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of modeling compositional meaning for phrases and sentences using distributional methods. We experiment with several possible combinations of representation and composition, exhibiting varying degrees of sophistication. Some are shallow while others operate over syntactic structure, rely on parameter learning, or require access to very large corpora. We find that shallow approaches are as good as more computationally intensive alternatives with regards to two particular tests: (1) phrase similarity and (2) paraphrase detection. The sizes of the involved training corpora and the generated vectors are not as important as the fit between the meaning representation and compositional method.</p><p>5 0.096004866 <a title="107-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Semantic_Compositionality_through_Recursive_Matrix-Vector_Spaces.html">116 emnlp-2012-Semantic Compositionality through Recursive Matrix-Vector Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Brody Huval ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Single-word vector space models have been very successful at learning lexical information. However, they cannot capture the compositional meaning of longer phrases, preventing them from a deeper understanding of language. We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between nouns using the syntactic path between them.</p><p>6 0.081648916 <a title="107-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Weakly_Supervised_Model_for_Sentence-Level_Semantic_Orientation_Analysis_with_Multiple_Experts.html">14 emnlp-2012-A Weakly Supervised Model for Sentence-Level Semantic Orientation Analysis with Multiple Experts</a></p>

<p>Author: Carina Silberer ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: A popular tradition of studying semantic representation has been driven by the assumption that word meaning can be learned from the linguistic environment, despite ample evidence suggesting that language is grounded in perception and action. In this paper we present a comparative study of models that represent word meaning based on linguistic and perceptual data. Linguistic information is approximated by naturally occurring corpora and sensorimotor experience by feature norms (i.e., attributes native speakers consider important in describing the meaning of a word). The models differ in terms of the mechanisms by which they integrate the two modalities. Experimental results show that a closer correspondence to human data can be obtained by uncovering latent information shared among the textual and perceptual modalities rather than arriving at semantic knowledge by concatenating the two.</p><p>5 0.37748039 <a title="107-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Semantic_Compositionality_through_Recursive_Matrix-Vector_Spaces.html">116 emnlp-2012-Semantic Compositionality through Recursive Matrix-Vector Spaces</a></p>

<p>Author: Wen-tau Yih ; Geoffrey Zweig ; John Platt</p><p>Abstract: Existing vector space models typically map synonyms and antonyms to similar word vectors, and thus fail to represent antonymy. We introduce a new vector space representation where antonyms lie on opposite sides of a sphere: in the word vector space, synonyms have cosine similarities close to one, while antonyms are close to minus one. We derive this representation with the aid of a thesaurus and latent semantic analysis (LSA). Each entry in the thesaurus a word sense along with its synonyms and antonyms is treated as a “document,” and the resulting document collection is subjected to LSA. The key contribution of this work is to show how to assign signs to the entries in the co-occurrence matrix on which LSA operates, so as to induce a subspace with the desired property. – – We evaluate this procedure with the Graduate Record Examination questions of (Mohammed et al., 2008) and find that the method improves on the results of that study. Further improvements result from refining the subspace representation with discriminative training, and augmenting the training data with general newspaper text. Altogether, we improve on the best previous results by 11points absolute in F measure.</p><p>2 0.61086249 <a title="107-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2012-An_%22AI_readability%22_Formula_for_French_as_a_Foreign_Language.html">17 emnlp-2012-An "AI readability" Formula for French as a Foreign Language</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Francois ; Cedrick Fairon</p><p>Abstract: This paper present a new readability formula for French as a foreign language (FFL), which relies on 46 textual features representative of the lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels as well as some of the specificities of the FFL context. We report comparisons between several techniques for feature selection and various learning algorithms. Our best model, based on support vector machines (SVM), significantly outperforms previous FFL formulas. We also found that semantic features behave poorly in our case, in contrast with some previous readability studies on English as a first language.</p><p>3 0.30243197 <a title="107-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Semantic_Compositionality_through_Recursive_Matrix-Vector_Spaces.html">116 emnlp-2012-Semantic Compositionality through Recursive Matrix-Vector Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Brody Huval ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Single-word vector space models have been very successful at learning lexical information. However, they cannot capture the compositional meaning of longer phrases, preventing them from a deeper understanding of language. We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between nouns using the syntactic path between them.</p><p>4 0.29744431 <a title="107-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_Syntactic_Categories_Using_Paradigmatic_Representations_of_Word_Context.html">79 emnlp-2012-Learning Syntactic Categories Using Paradigmatic Representations of Word Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehmet Ali Yatbaz ; Enis Sert ; Deniz Yuret</p><p>Abstract: We investigate paradigmatic representations of word context in the domain of unsupervised syntactic category acquisition. Paradigmatic representations of word context are based on potential substitutes of a word in contrast to syntagmatic representations based on properties of neighboring words. We compare a bigram based baseline model with several paradigmatic models and demonstrate significant gains in accuracy. Our best model based on Euclidean co-occurrence embedding combines the paradigmatic context representation with morphological and orthographic features and achieves 80% many-to-one accuracy on a 45-tag 1M word corpus.</p><p>5 0.2971001 <a title="107-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Fast_Large-Scale_Approximate_Graph_Construction_for_NLP.html">52 emnlp-2012-Fast Large-Scale Approximate Graph Construction for NLP</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Goyal ; Hal Daume III ; Raul Guerra</p><p>Abstract: Many natural language processing problems involve constructing large nearest-neighbor graphs. We propose a system called FLAG to construct such graphs approximately from large data sets. To handle the large amount of data, our algorithm maintains approximate counts based on sketching algorithms. To find the approximate nearest neighbors, our algorithm pairs a new distributed online-PMI algorithm with novel fast approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms (variants of PLEB). These algorithms return the approximate nearest neighbors quickly. We show our system’s efficiency in both intrinsic and extrinsic experiments. We further evaluate our fast search algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively on two NLP applications.</p><p>6 0.29548341 <a title="107-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Detecting_Subgroups_in_Online_Discussions_by_Modeling_Positive_and_Negative_Relations_among_Participants.html">32 emnlp-2012-Detecting Subgroups in Online Discussions by Modeling Positive and Negative Relations among Participants</a></p>

<p>Author: Emily Pitler ; Sampath Kannan ; Mitchell Marcus</p><p>Abstract: We introduce gap inheritance, a new structural property on trees, which provides a way to quantify the degree to which intervals of descendants can be nested. Based on this property, two new classes of trees are derived that provide a closer approximation to the set of plausible natural language dependency trees than some alternative classes of trees: unlike projective trees, a word can have descendants in more than one interval; unlike spanning trees, these intervals cannot be nested in arbitrary ways. The 1-Inherit class of trees has exactly the same empirical coverage of natural language sentences as the class of mildly nonprojective trees, yet the optimal scoring tree can be found in an order of magnitude less time. Gap-minding trees (the second class) have the property that all edges into an interval of descendants come from the same node, and thus an algorithm which uses only single in- tervals can produce trees in which a node has descendants in multiple intervals.</p><p>3 0.14492109 <a title="104-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Improved_Parsing_and_POS_Tagging_Using_Inter-Sentence_Consistency_Constraints.html">64 emnlp-2012-Improved Parsing and POS Tagging Using Inter-Sentence Consistency Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander Rush ; Roi Reichart ; Michael Collins ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art statistical parsers and POS taggers perform very well when trained with large amounts of in-domain data. When training data is out-of-domain or limited, accuracy degrades. In this paper, we aim to compensate for the lack of available training data by exploiting similarities between test set sentences. We show how to augment sentencelevel models for parsing and POS tagging with inter-sentence consistency constraints. To deal with the resulting global objective, we present an efficient and exact dual decomposition decoding algorithm. In experiments, we add consistency constraints to the MST parser and the Stanford part-of-speech tagger and demonstrate significant error reduction in the domain adaptation and the lightly supervised settings across five languages.</p><p>4 0.13948287 <a title="104-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Generalized_Higher-Order_Dependency_Parsing_with_Cube_Pruning.html">57 emnlp-2012-Generalized Higher-Order Dependency Parsing with Cube Pruning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Zhang ; Ryan McDonald</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art graph-based parsers use features over higher-order dependencies that rely on decoding algorithms that are slow and difficult to generalize. On the other hand, transition-based dependency parsers can easily utilize such features without increasing the linear complexity of the shift-reduce system beyond a constant. In this paper, we attempt to address this imbalance for graph-based parsing by generalizing the Eisner (1996) algorithm to handle arbitrary features over higherorder dependencies. The generalization is at the cost of asymptotic efficiency. To account for this, cube pruning for decoding is utilized (Chiang, 2007). For the first time, label tuple and structural features such as valencies can be scored efficiently with third-order features in a graph-based parser. Our parser achieves the state-of-art unlabeled accuracy of 93.06% and labeled accuracy of 91.86% on the standard test set for English, at a faster speed than a reimplementation ofthe third-ordermodel of Koo et al. (2010).</p><p>5 0.12716353 <a title="104-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Word_Salad%3A_Relating_Food_Prices_and_Descriptions.html">139 emnlp-2012-Word Salad: Relating Food Prices and Descriptions</a></p>

<p>Author: Vivek Srikumar ; Gourab Kundu ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of predicting structures in the context of NLP. Typically, in structured prediction, an inference procedure is applied to each example independently of the others. In this paper, we seek to optimize the time complexity of inference over entire datasets, rather than individual examples. By considering the general inference representation provided by integer linear programs, we propose three exact inference theorems which allow us to re-use earlier solutions for certain instances, thereby completely avoiding possibly expensive calls to the inference procedure. We also identify several approximation schemes which can provide further speedup. We instantiate these ideas to the structured prediction task of semantic role labeling and show that we can achieve a speedup of over 2.5 using our approach while retaining the guarantees of exactness and a further speedup of over 3 using approximations that do not degrade performance.</p><p>5 0.460738 <a title="104-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Improved_Parsing_and_POS_Tagging_Using_Inter-Sentence_Consistency_Constraints.html">64 emnlp-2012-Improved Parsing and POS Tagging Using Inter-Sentence Consistency Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Chikara Hashimoto ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Stijn De Saeger ; Jong-Hoon Oh ; Jun'ichi Kazama</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new semantic orientation, Excitation, and its automatic acquisition method. Excitation is a semantic property of predicates that classifies them into excitatory, inhibitory and neutral. We show that Excitation is useful for extracting contradiction pairs (e.g., destroy cancer develop cancer) and causality pairs (cea.ng.c,e rin ⊥cre daesvee lionp c craimnece r⇒) ahnedig chatuensa laintyx pieatyir)s.

Furthermore, by combining these extracted causality and contradiction pairs, we can generate one million plausible causality hypotheses that are not written in any single sentence in our corpus ⊥ with reasonable precision.</p><p>2 0.7686972 <a title="104-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2012-Opinion_Target_Extraction_Using_Word-Based_Translation_Model.html">101 emnlp-2012-Opinion Target Extraction Using Word-Based Translation Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Kang Liu ; Liheng Xu ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to extract opinion targets based on wordbased translation model (WTM). At first, we apply WTM in a monolingual scenario to mine the associations between opinion targets and opinion words. Then, a graphbased algorithm is exploited to extract opinion targets, where candidate opinion relevance estimated from the mined associations, is incorporated with candidate importance to generate a global measure. By using WTM, our method can capture opinion relations more precisely, especially for long-span relations. In particular, compared with previous syntax-based methods, our method can effectively avoid noises from parsing errors when dealing with informal texts in large Web corpora. By using graph-based algorithm, opinion targets are extracted in a global process, which can effectively alleviate the problem of error propagation in traditional bootstrap-based methods, such as Double Propagation. The experimental results on three real world datasets in different sizes and languages show that our approach is more effective and robust than state-of-art methods. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.71928853 <a title="104-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Parse%2C_Price_and_Cut-Delayed_Column_and_Row_Generation_for_Graph_Based_Parsers.html">104 emnlp-2012-Parse, Price and Cut-Delayed Column and Row Generation for Graph Based Parsers</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Riedel ; David Smith ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based dependency parsers suffer from the sheer number of higher order edges they need to (a) score and (b) consider during optimization. Here we show that when working with LP relaxations, large fractions of these edges can be pruned before they are fully scored—without any loss of optimality guarantees and, hence, accuracy. This is achieved by iteratively parsing with a subset of higherorder edges, adding higher-order edges that may improve the score of the current solution, and adding higher-order edges that are implied by the current best first order edges. This amounts to delayed column and row generation in the LP relaxation and is guaranteed to provide the optimal LP solution. For second order grandparent models, our method considers, or scores, no more than 6–13% of the second order edges of the full model. This yields up to an eightfold parsing speedup, while pro- viding the same empirical accuracy and certificates of optimality as working with the full LP relaxation. We also provide a tighter LP formulation for grandparent models that leads to a smaller integrality gap and higher speed.</p><p>4 0.63708937 <a title="104-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Forced_Derivation_Tree_based_Model_Training_to_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">54 emnlp-2012-Forced Derivation Tree based Model Training to Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Duan ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: A forced derivation tree (FDT) of a sentence pair {f, e} denotes a derivation tree that can tpraainrsl {afte, f} idnetono itetss a acc duerraivtea target etrea tnhsaltat cioann e. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages structured knowledge contained in FDTs to train component models for statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. We first describe how to generate different FDTs for each sentence pair in training corpus, and then present how to infer the optimal FDTs based on their derivation and alignment qualities. As the first step in this line of research, we verify the effectiveness of our approach in a BTGbased phrasal system, and propose four FDTbased component models. Experiments are carried out on large scale English-to-Japanese and Chinese-to-English translation tasks, and significant improvements are reported on both translation quality and alignment quality.</p><p>5 0.40942228 <a title="104-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Extracting_Opinion_Expressions_with_semi-Markov_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">51 emnlp-2012-Extracting Opinion Expressions with semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Bishan Yang ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: Extracting opinion expressions from text is usually formulated as a token-level sequence labeling task tackled using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). CRFs, however, do not readily model potentially useful segment-level information like syntactic constituent structure. Thus, we propose a semi-CRF-based approach to the task that can perform sequence labeling at the segment level. We extend the original semi-CRF model (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004) to allow the modeling of arbitrarily long expressions while accounting for their likely syntactic structure when modeling segment boundaries. We evaluate performance on two opinion extraction tasks, and, in contrast to previous sequence labeling approaches to the task, explore the usefulness of segment- level syntactic parse features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both opinion expression tasks.</p><p>6 0.4017134 <a title="104-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Weakly_Supervised_Model_for_Sentence-Level_Semantic_Orientation_Analysis_with_Multiple_Experts.html">14 emnlp-2012-A Weakly Supervised Model for Sentence-Level Semantic Orientation Analysis with Multiple Experts</a></p>

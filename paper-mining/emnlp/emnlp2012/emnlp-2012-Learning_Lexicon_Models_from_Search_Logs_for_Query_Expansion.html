<p>Author: Huizhong Duan ; Yanen Li ; ChengXiang Zhai ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative training in query spelling correction is difficult due to the complex internal structures of the data. Recent work on query spelling correction suggests a two stage approach a noisy channel model that is used to retrieve a number of candidate corrections, followed by discriminatively trained ranker applied to these candidates. The ranker, however, suffers from the fact the low recall of the first, suboptimal, search stage. This paper proposes to directly optimize the search stage with a discriminative model based on latent structural SVM. In this model, we treat query spelling correction as a multiclass classification problem with structured input and output. The latent structural information is used to model the alignment of words in the spelling correction process. Experiment results show that as a standalone speller, our model outperforms all the baseline systems. It also attains a higher recall compared with the noisy channel model, and can therefore serve as a better filtering stage when combined with a ranker.</p><p>3 0.13414016 <a title="78-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Natural_Language_Questions_for_the_Web_of_Data.html">97 emnlp-2012-Natural Language Questions for the Web of Data</a></p>

Exploring this heterogeneous data by structured query languages is tedious and error-prone even for skilled users. To ease the task, this paper presents a methodology for translating natural language questions into structured SPARQL queries over linked-data sources. Our method is based on an integer linear program to solve several disambiguation tasks jointly: the segmentation of questions into phrases; the mapping of phrases to semantic entities, classes, and relations; and the construction of SPARQL triple patterns. Our solution harnesses the rich type system provided by knowledge bases in the web of linked data, to constrain our semantic-coherence objective function.

<p>Author: Alexander Rush ; Roi Reichart ; Michael Collins ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art statistical parsers and POS taggers perform very well when trained with large amounts of in-domain data. When training data is out-of-domain or limited, accuracy degrades. In this paper, we aim to compensate for the lack of available training data by exploiting similarities between test set sentences. We show how to augment sentencelevel models for parsing and POS tagging with inter-sentence consistency constraints. To deal with the resulting global objective, we present an efficient and exact dual decomposition decoding algorithm. In experiments, we add consistency constraints to the MST parser and the Stanford part-of-speech tagger and demonstrate significant error reduction in the domain adaptation and the lightly supervised settings across five languages.</p><p>5 0.12155668 <a title="78-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Collocation_Polarity_Disambiguation_Using_Web-based_Pseudo_Contexts.html">28 emnlp-2012-Collocation Polarity Disambiguation Using Web-based Pseudo Contexts</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanyan Zhao ; Bing Qin ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of collocation polarity disambiguation. The collocation refers to a binary tuple of a polarity word and a target (such as ⟨long, battery life⟩ or ⟨long, ast atratrguep⟩t) (, siunc whh aisch ⟨ ltohneg s,en btatitmeernyt l iofrei⟩en otrat ⟨iolonn gof, tshtaer polarity wwohirdch (“long”) changes along owniothf different targets (“battery life” or “startup”). To disambiguate a collocation’s polarity, previous work always turned to investigate the polarities of its surrounding contexts, and then assigned the majority polarity to the collocation. However, these contexts are limited, thus the resulting polarity is insufficient to be reliable. We therefore propose an unsupervised three-component framework to expand some pseudo contexts from web, to help disambiguate a collocation’s polarity.Without using any additional labeled data, experiments , show that our method is effective.</p><p>6 0.10217341 <a title="78-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Bilingual_Lexicon_Extraction_from_Comparable_Corpora_Using_Label_Propagation.html">25 emnlp-2012-Bilingual Lexicon Extraction from Comparable Corpora Using Label Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ni Lao ; Amarnag Subramanya ; Fernando Pereira ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We study how to extend a large knowledge base (Freebase) by reading relational information from a large Web text corpus. Previous studies on extracting relational knowledge from text show the potential of syntactic patterns for extraction, but they do not exploit background knowledge of other relations in the knowledge base. We describe a distributed, Web-scale implementation of a path-constrained random walk model that learns syntactic-semantic inference rules for binary relations from a graph representation of the parsed text and the knowledge base. Experiments show significant accuracy improvements in binary relation prediction over methods that consider only text, or only the existing knowledge base.</p><p>4 0.46208158 <a title="78-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Natural_Language_Questions_for_the_Web_of_Data.html">97 emnlp-2012-Natural Language Questions for the Web of Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Akihiro Tamura ; Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for lexicon extraction that extracts translation pairs from comparable corpora by using graphbased label propagation. In previous work, it was established that performance drastically decreases when the coverage of a seed lexicon is small. We resolve this problem by utilizing indirect relations with the bilingual seeds together with direct relations, in which each word is represented by a distribution of translated seeds. The seed distributions are propagated over a graph representing relations among words, and translation pairs are extracted by identifying word pairs with a high similarity in the seed distributions. We propose two types of the graphs: a co-occurrence graph, representing co-occurrence relations between words, and a similarity graph, representing context similarities between words. Evaluations using English and Japanese patent comparable corpora show that our proposed graph propagation method outperforms conventional methods. Further, the similarity graph achieved improved performance by clustering synonyms into the same translation.</p><p>6 0.38069704 <a title="78-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Collocation_Polarity_Disambiguation_Using_Web-based_Pseudo_Contexts.html">28 emnlp-2012-Collocation Polarity Disambiguation Using Web-based Pseudo Contexts</a></p>

<p>Author: Su-Youn Yoon ; Suma Bhat</p><p>Abstract: This study presents a novel method that measures English language learners’ syntactic competence towards improving automated speech scoring systems. In contrast to most previous studies which focus on the length of production units such as the mean length of clauses, we focused on capturing the differences in the distribution of morpho-syntactic features or grammatical expressions across proficiency. We estimated the syntactic competence through the use of corpus-based NLP techniques. Assuming that the range and so- phistication of grammatical expressions can be captured by the distribution of Part-ofSpeech (POS) tags, vector space models of POS tags were constructed. We use a large corpus of English learners’ responses that are classified into four proficiency levels by human raters. Our proposed feature measures the similarity of a given response with the most proficient group and is then estimates the learner’s syntactic competence level. Widely outperforming the state-of-the-art measures of syntactic complexity, our method attained a significant correlation with humanrated scores. The correlation between humanrated scores and features based on manual transcription was 0.43 and the same based on ASR-hypothesis was slightly lower, 0.42. An important advantage of our method is its robustness against speech recognition errors not to mention the simplicity of feature generation that captures a reasonable set of learnerspecific syntactic errors. 600 Measures Suma Bhat Beckman Institute, Urbana, IL 61801 . spbhat 2 @ i l l ino i edu s</p><p>3 0.38668329 <a title="78-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Do_Neighbours_Help%3F_An_Exploration_of_Graph-based_Algorithms_for_Cross-domain_Sentiment_Classification.html">34 emnlp-2012-Do Neighbours Help?

In particular, the paper analyses two existing methods: an optimisation problem and a ranking algorithm. We compare these graph-based methods with each other and with the other state-ofthe-art approaches and conclude that graph domain representations offer a competitive solution to the domain adaptation problem. Analysis of the best parameters for graphbased algorithms reveals that there are no optimal values valid for all domain pairs and that these values are dependent on the characteristics of corresponding domains.</p><p>4 0.38504186 <a title="78-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Answering_Opinion_Questions_on_Products_by_Exploiting_Hierarchical_Organization_of_Consumer_Reviews.html">20 emnlp-2012-Answering Opinion Questions on Products by Exploiting Hierarchical Organization of Consumer Reviews</a></p>

The hierarchy organizes product aspects as nodes following their parent-child relations. For each aspect, the reviews and corresponding opinions on this aspect are stored. We develop a new framework for opinion Questions Answering, which enables accurate question analysis and effective answer generation by making use the hierarchy. In particular, we first identify the (explicit/implicit) product aspects asked in the questions and their sub-aspects by referring to the hierarchy. We then retrieve the corresponding review fragments relevant to the aspects from the hierarchy. In order to gener- ate appropriate answers from the review fragments, we develop a multi-criteria optimization approach for answer generation by simultaneously taking into account review salience, coherence, diversity, and parent-child relations among the aspects. We conduct evaluations on 11 popular products in four domains. The evaluated corpus contains 70,359 consumer reviews and 220 questions on these products. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>5 0.38214695 <a title="78-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Collocation_Polarity_Disambiguation_Using_Web-based_Pseudo_Contexts.html">28 emnlp-2012-Collocation Polarity Disambiguation Using Web-based Pseudo Contexts</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanyan Zhao ; Bing Qin ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of collocation polarity disambiguation. The collocation refers to a binary tuple of a polarity word and a target (such as ⟨long, battery life⟩ or ⟨long, ast atratrguep⟩t) (, siunc whh aisch ⟨ ltohneg s,en btatitmeernyt l iofrei⟩en otrat ⟨iolonn gof, tshtaer polarity wwohirdch (“long”) changes along owniothf different targets (“battery life” or “startup”). To disambiguate a collocation’s polarity, previous work always turned to investigate the polarities of its surrounding contexts, and then assigned the majority polarity to the collocation. However, these contexts are limited, thus the resulting polarity is insufficient to be reliable. We therefore propose an unsupervised three-component framework to expand some pseudo contexts from web, to help disambiguate a collocation’s polarity.Without using any additional labeled data, experiments , show that our method is effective.</p><p>6 0.38182023 <a title="78-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Weakly_Supervised_Model_for_Sentence-Level_Semantic_Orientation_Analysis_with_Multiple_Experts.html">14 emnlp-2012-A Weakly Supervised Model for Sentence-Level Semantic Orientation Analysis with Multiple Experts</a></p>

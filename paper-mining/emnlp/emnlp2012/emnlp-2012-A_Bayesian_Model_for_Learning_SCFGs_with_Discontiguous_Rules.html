<p>Author: Shujie Liu ; Chi-Ho Li ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: The training of most syntactic SMT approaches involves two essential components, word alignment and monolingual parser. In the current state of the art these two components are mutually independent, thus causing problems like lack of rule generalization, and violation of syntactic correspondence in translation rules. In this paper, we propose two ways of re-training monolingual parser with the target of maximizing the consistency between parse trees and alignment matrices. One is targeted self-training with a simple evaluation function; the other is based on training data selection from forced alignment of bilingual data. We also propose an auxiliary method for boosting alignment quality, by symmetrizing alignment matrices with respect to parse trees. The best combination of these novel methods achieves 3 Bleu point gain in an IWSLT task and more than 1 Bleu point gain in NIST tasks. 1</p><p>3 0.14366683 <a title="1-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Training_Factored_PCFGs_with_Expectation_Propagation.html">126 emnlp-2012-Training Factored PCFGs with Expectation Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Hall ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: PCFGs can grow exponentially as additional annotations are added to an initially simple base grammar. We present an approach where multiple annotations coexist, but in a factored manner that avoids this combinatorial explosion. Our method works with linguisticallymotivated annotations, induced latent structure, lexicalization, or any mix of the three. We use a structured expectation propagation algorithm that makes use of the factored structure in two ways. First, by partitioning the factors, it speeds up parsing exponentially over the unfactored approach. Second, it minimizes the redundancy of the factors during training, improving accuracy over an independent approach. Using purely latent variable annotations, we can efficiently train and parse with up to 8 latent bits per symbol, achieving F1 scores up to 88.4 on the Penn Treebank while using two orders of magnitudes fewer parameters compared to the na¨ ıve approach. Combining latent, lexicalized, and unlexicalized anno- tations, our best parser gets 89.4 F1 on all sentences from section 23 of the Penn Treebank.</p><p>4 0.13786227 <a title="1-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Forced_Derivation_Tree_based_Model_Training_to_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">54 emnlp-2012-Forced Derivation Tree based Model Training to Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

In this paper, we present an approach that leverages structured knowledge contained in FDTs to train component models for statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. We first describe how to generate different FDTs for each sentence pair in training corpus, and then present how to infer the optimal FDTs based on their derivation and alignment qualities. As the first step in this line of research, we verify the effectiveness of our approach in a BTGbased phrasal system, and propose four FDTbased component models. Experiments are carried out on large scale English-to-Japanese and Chinese-to-English translation tasks, and significant improvements are reported on both translation quality and alignment quality.</p><p>5 0.13344622 <a title="1-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Transforming_Trees_to_Improve_Syntactic_Convergence.html">127 emnlp-2012-Transforming Trees to Improve Syntactic Convergence</a></p>

Using the manually annotated English Chinese Translation Treebank, we show how our method automatically discovers transformations that accommodate differences in English and Chinese syntax. Furthermore, when transformations are learned on automatically generated trees and alignments from the same domain as the training data for a syntactic MT system, the transformed trees achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over baseline trees.</p><p>6 0.1300296 <a title="1-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Left-to-Right_Tree-to-String_Decoding_with_Prediction.html">82 emnlp-2012-Left-to-Right Tree-to-String Decoding with Prediction</a></p>

<p>Author: Ajay Nagesh ; Ganesh Ramakrishnan ; Laura Chiticariu ; Rajasekar Krishnamurthy ; Ankush Dharkar ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Generic rule-based systems for Information Extraction (IE) have been shown to work reasonably well out-of-the-box, and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with further domain customization. However, it is generally recognized that manually building and customizing rules is a complex and labor intensive process. In this paper, we discuss an approach that facilitates the process of building customizable rules for Named-Entity Recognition (NER) tasks via rule induction, in the Annotation Query Language (AQL). Given a set of basic features and an annotated document collection, our goal is to generate an initial set of rules with reasonable accuracy, that are interpretable and thus can be easily refined by a human developer. We present an efficient rule induction process, modeled on a fourstage manual rule development process and present initial promising results with our system. We also propose a simple notion of extractor complexity as a first step to quantify the interpretability of an extractor, and study the effect of induction bias and customization ofbasic features on the accuracy and complexity of induced rules. We demonstrate through experiments that the induced rules have good accuracy and low complexity according to our complexity measure.</p><p>5 0.517286 <a title="1-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Exploring_Adaptor_Grammars_for_Native_Language_Identification.html">48 emnlp-2012-Exploring Adaptor Grammars for Native Language Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Sze-Meng Jojo Wong ; Mark Dras ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: The task of inferring the native language of an author based on texts written in a second language has generally been tackled as a classification problem, typically using as features a mix of n-grams over characters and part of speech tags (for small and fixed n) and unigram function words. To capture arbitrarily long n-grams that syntax-based approaches have suggested are useful, adaptor grammars have some promise. In this work we investigate their extension to identifying n-gram collocations of arbitrary length over a mix of PoS tags and words, using both maxent and induced syntactic language model approaches to classification. After presenting a new, simple baseline, we show that learned collocations used as features in a maxent model perform better still, but that the story is more mixed for the syntactic language model.</p><p>6 0.51262724 <a title="1-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Training_Factored_PCFGs_with_Expectation_Propagation.html">126 emnlp-2012-Training Factored PCFGs with Expectation Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Atsushi Fujita ; Pierre Isabelle ; Roland Kuhn</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a paraphrase acquisition method that uncovers and exploits generalities underlying paraphrases: paraphrase patterns are first induced and then used to collect novel instances. Unlike existing methods, ours uses both bilingual parallel and monolingual corpora. While the former are regarded as a source of high-quality seed paraphrases, the latter are searched for paraphrases that match patterns learned from the seed paraphrases. We show how one can use monolingual corpora, which are far more numerous and larger than bilingual corpora, to obtain paraphrases that rival in quality those derived directly from bilingual corpora. In our experiments, the number of paraphrase pairs obtained in this way from monolingual corpora was a large multiple of the number of seed paraphrases. Human evaluation through a paraphrase substitution test demonstrated that the newly acquired paraphrase pairs are ofreasonable quality. Remaining noise can be further reduced by filtering seed paraphrases.</p><p>3 0.93659067 <a title="1-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Unsupervised_PCFG_Induction_for_Grounded_Language_Learning_with_Highly_Ambiguous_Supervision.html">133 emnlp-2012-Unsupervised PCFG Induction for Grounded Language Learning with Highly Ambiguous Supervision</a></p>
<p>Author: Joohyun Kim ; Raymond Mooney</p><p>Abstract: “Grounded” language learning employs training data in the form of sentences paired with relevant but ambiguous perceptual contexts. B ¨orschinger et al. (201 1) introduced an approach to grounded language learning based on unsupervised PCFG induction. Their approach works well when each sentence potentially refers to one of a small set of possible meanings, such as in the sportscasting task. However, it does not scale to problems with a large set of potential meanings for each sentence, such as the navigation instruction following task studied by Chen and Mooney (201 1). This paper presents an enhancement of the PCFG approach that scales to such problems with highly-ambiguous supervision. Experimental results on the navigation task demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>4 0.92458022 <a title="1-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Exploiting_Reducibility_in_Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing.html">46 emnlp-2012-Exploiting Reducibility in Unsupervised Dependency Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Wang Ling ; Joao Graca ; Isabel Trancoso ; Alan Black</p><p>Abstract: Phrase-based machine translation models have shown to yield better translations than Word-based models, since phrase pairs encode the contextual information that is needed for a more accurate translation. However, many phrase pairs do not encode any relevant context, which means that the translation event encoded in that phrase pair is led by smaller translation events that are independent from each other, and can be found on smaller phrase pairs, with little or no loss in translation accuracy. In this work, we propose a relative entropy model for translation models, that measures how likely a phrase pair encodes a translation event that is derivable using smaller translation events with similar probabilities. This model is then applied to phrase table pruning. Tests show that considerable amounts of phrase pairs can be excluded, without much impact on the transla- . tion quality. In fact, we show that better translations can be obtained using our pruned models, due to the compression of the search space during decoding.</p><p>6 0.78579921 <a title="1-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Systematic_Comparison_of_Phrase_Table_Pruning_Techniques.html">11 emnlp-2012-A Systematic Comparison of Phrase Table Pruning Techniques</a></p>

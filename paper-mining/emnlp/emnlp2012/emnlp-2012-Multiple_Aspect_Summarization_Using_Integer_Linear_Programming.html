<p>Author: Vivek Srikumar ; Gourab Kundu ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of predicting structures in the context of NLP. Typically, in structured prediction, an inference procedure is applied to each example independently of the others. In this paper, we seek to optimize the time complexity of inference over entire datasets, rather than individual examples. By considering the general inference representation provided by integer linear programs, we propose three exact inference theorems which allow us to re-use earlier solutions for certain instances, thereby completely avoiding possibly expensive calls to the inference procedure. We also identify several approximation schemes which can provide further speedup. We instantiate these ideas to the structured prediction task of semantic role labeling and show that we can achieve a speedup of over 2.5 using our approach while retaining the guarantees of exactness and a further speedup of over 3 using approximations that do not degrade performance.</p><p>3 0.13854253 <a title="94-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Framework_of_Automatic_Text_Summarization_Using_Reinforcement_Learning.html">56 emnlp-2012-Framework of Automatic Text Summarization Using Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Seonggi Ryang ; Takeshi Abekawa</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to the problem of automatic text summarization called Automatic Summarization using Reinforcement Learning (ASRL) in this paper, which models the process of constructing a summary within the framework of reinforcement learning and attempts to optimize the given score function with the given feature representation of a summary. We demonstrate that the method of reinforcement learning can be adapted to automatic summarization problems naturally and simply, and other summarizing techniques, such as sentence compression, can be easily adapted as actions of the framework. The experimental results indicated ASRL was superior to the best performing method in DUC2004 and comparable to the state of the art ILP-style method, in terms of ROUGE scores. The results also revealed ASRL can search for sub-optimal solutions efficiently under conditions for effectively selecting features and the score function.</p><p>4 0.1326357 <a title="94-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Generalizing_Sub-sentential_Paraphrase_Acquisition_across_Original_Signal_Type_of_Text_Pairs.html">58 emnlp-2012-Generalizing Sub-sentential Paraphrase Acquisition across Original Signal Type of Text Pairs</a></p>

A corpus of 2,500 annotated sentences in English and French is described, and performance on this corpus is reported for an efficient system combination exploiting a large set of features for paraphrase recognition.

<p>Author: Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick ; David Burkett ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We investigate two aspects of the empirical behavior of paired significance tests for NLP systems. First, when one system appears to outperform another, how does significance level relate in practice to the magnitude of the gain, to the size of the test set, to the similarity of the systems, and so on? Is it true that for each task there is a gain which roughly implies significance? We explore these issues across a range of NLP tasks using both large collections of past systemsâ€™ outputs and variants of single systems. Next, once significance levels are computed, how well does the standard i.i.d. notion of significance hold up in practical settings where future distributions are neither independent nor identically distributed, such as across domains? We explore this question using a range of test set variations for constituency parsing.</p><p>6 0.12909871 <a title="94-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Answering_Opinion_Questions_on_Products_by_Exploiting_Hierarchical_Organization_of_Consumer_Reviews.html">20 emnlp-2012-Answering Opinion Questions on Products by Exploiting Hierarchical Organization of Consumer Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Song Feng ; Ritwik Banerjee ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Much of the writing styles recognized in rhetorical and composition theories involve deep syntactic elements. However, most previous research for computational stylometric analysis has relied on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns. Some very recent work has shown that PCFG models can detect distributional difference in syntactic styles, but without offering much insights into exactly what constitute salient stylistic elements in sentence structure characterizing each authorship. In this paper, we present a comprehensive exploration of syntactic elements in writing styles, with particular emphasis on interpretable characterization of stylistic elements. We present analytic insights with respect to the authorship attribution task in two different domains. ,</p><p>5 0.43197599 <a title="94-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Discovering_Diverse_and_Salient_Threads_in_Document_Collections.html">33 emnlp-2012-Discovering Diverse and Salient Threads in Document Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Gillenwater ; Alex Kulesza ; Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic technique for modeling and extracting salient structure from large document collections. As in clustering and topic modeling, our goal is to provide an organizing perspective into otherwise overwhelming amounts of information. We are particularly interested in revealing and exploiting relationships between documents. To this end, we focus on extracting diverse sets of threadsâ€”singlylinked, coherent chains of important documents. To illustrate, we extract research threads from citation graphs and construct timelines from news articles. Our method is highly scalable, running on a corpus of over 30 million words in about four minutes, more than 75 times faster than a dynamic topic model. Finally, the results from our model more closely resemble human news summaries according to several metrics and are also preferred by human judges.</p><p>6 0.42201367 <a title="94-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-An_Empirical_Investigation_of_Statistical_Significance_in_NLP.html">18 emnlp-2012-An Empirical Investigation of Statistical Significance in NLP</a></p>

<p>Author: Ajay Nagesh ; Ganesh Ramakrishnan ; Laura Chiticariu ; Rajasekar Krishnamurthy ; Ankush Dharkar ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Generic rule-based systems for Information Extraction (IE) have been shown to work reasonably well out-of-the-box, and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with further domain customization. However, it is generally recognized that manually building and customizing rules is a complex and labor intensive process. In this paper, we discuss an approach that facilitates the process of building customizable rules for Named-Entity Recognition (NER) tasks via rule induction, in the Annotation Query Language (AQL). Given a set of basic features and an annotated document collection, our goal is to generate an initial set of rules with reasonable accuracy, that are interpretable and thus can be easily refined by a human developer. We present an efficient rule induction process, modeled on a fourstage manual rule development process and present initial promising results with our system. We also propose a simple notion of extractor complexity as a first step to quantify the interpretability of an extractor, and study the effect of induction bias and customization ofbasic features on the accuracy and complexity of induced rules. We demonstrate through experiments that the induced rules have good accuracy and low complexity according to our complexity measure.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.88939077 <a title="94-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2012-Multiple_Aspect_Summarization_Using_Integer_Linear_Programming.html">94 emnlp-2012-Multiple Aspect Summarization Using Integer Linear Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Valentin I. Spitkovsky ; Hiyan Alshawi ; Daniel Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We present a new family of models for unsupervised parsing, Dependency and Boundary models, that use cues at constituent boundaries to inform head-outward dependency tree generation. We build on three intuitions that are explicit in phrase-structure grammars but only implicit in standard dependency formulations: (i) Distributions of words that occur at sentence boundaries such as English determiners resemble constituent edges. (ii) Punctuation at sentence boundaries further helps distinguish full sentences from fragments like headlines and titles, allowing us to model grammatical differences between complete and incomplete sentences. (iii) Sentence-internal punctuation boundaries help with longer-distance dependencies, since punctuation correlates with constituent edges. Our models induce state-of-the-art dependency grammars for many languages without â€” â€” special knowledge of optimal input sentence lengths or biased, manually-tuned initializers.</p><p>4 0.61973739 <a title="94-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Answering_Opinion_Questions_on_Products_by_Exploiting_Hierarchical_Organization_of_Consumer_Reviews.html">20 emnlp-2012-Answering Opinion Questions on Products by Exploiting Hierarchical Organization of Consumer Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxing Yu ; Zheng-Jun Zha ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes to generate appropriate answers for opinion questions about products by exploiting the hierarchical organization of consumer reviews. The hierarchy organizes product aspects as nodes following their parent-child relations. For each aspect, the reviews and corresponding opinions on this aspect are stored. We develop a new framework for opinion Questions Answering, which enables accurate question analysis and effective answer generation by making use the hierarchy. In particular, we first identify the (explicit/implicit) product aspects asked in the questions and their sub-aspects by referring to the hierarchy. We then retrieve the corresponding review fragments relevant to the aspects from the hierarchy. In order to gener- ate appropriate answers from the review fragments, we develop a multi-criteria optimization approach for answer generation by simultaneously taking into account review salience, coherence, diversity, and parent-child relations among the aspects. We conduct evaluations on 11 popular products in four domains. The evaluated corpus contains 70,359 consumer reviews and 220 questions on these products. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>5 0.55531752 <a title="94-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Framework_of_Automatic_Text_Summarization_Using_Reinforcement_Learning.html">56 emnlp-2012-Framework of Automatic Text Summarization Using Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Seonggi Ryang ; Takeshi Abekawa</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to the problem of automatic text summarization called Automatic Summarization using Reinforcement Learning (ASRL) in this paper, which models the process of constructing a summary within the framework of reinforcement learning and attempts to optimize the given score function with the given feature representation of a summary. We demonstrate that the method of reinforcement learning can be adapted to automatic summarization problems naturally and simply, and other summarizing techniques, such as sentence compression, can be easily adapted as actions of the framework. The experimental results indicated ASRL was superior to the best performing method in DUC2004 and comparable to the state of the art ILP-style method, in terms of ROUGE scores. The results also revealed ASRL can search for sub-optimal solutions efficiently under conditions for effectively selecting features and the score function.</p><p>6 0.51060355 <a title="94-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Detecting_Subgroups_in_Online_Discussions_by_Modeling_Positive_and_Negative_Relations_among_Participants.html">32 emnlp-2012-Detecting Subgroups in Online Discussions by Modeling Positive and Negative Relations among Participants</a></p>

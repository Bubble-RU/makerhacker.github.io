Previous studies on extracting relational knowledge from text show the potential of syntactic patterns for extraction, but they do not exploit background knowledge of other relations in the knowledge base. We describe a distributed, Web-scale implementation of a path-constrained random walk model that learns syntactic-semantic inference rules for binary relations from a graph representation of the parsed text and the knowledge base.

<p>Author: Xianpei Han ; Le Sun</p><p>Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has received considerable attention in recent years. Given many name mentions in a document, the goal of EL is to predict their referent entities in a knowledge base. Traditionally, there have been two distinct directions of EL research: one focusing on the effects of mention’s context compatibility, assuming that “the referent entity of a mention is reflected by its context”; the other dealing with the effects of document’s topic coherence, assuming that “a mention ’s referent entity should be coherent with the document’ ’s main topics”. In this paper, we propose a generative model called entitytopic model, to effectively join the above two complementary directions together. By jointly modeling and exploiting the context compatibility, the topic coherence and the correlation between them, our model can – accurately link all mentions in a document using both the local information (including the words and the mentions in a document) and the global knowledge (including the topic knowledge, the entity context knowledge and the entity name knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. 1</p><p>4 0.13676104 <a title="47-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-No_Noun_Phrase_Left_Behind%3A_Detecting_and_Typing_Unlinkable_Entities.html">98 emnlp-2012-No Noun Phrase Left Behind: Detecting and Typing Unlinkable Entities</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Lin ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Entity linking systems link noun-phrase mentions in text to their corresponding Wikipedia articles. However, NLP applications would gain from the ability to detect and type all entities mentioned in text, including the long tail of entities not prominent enough to have their own Wikipedia articles. In this paper we show that once the Wikipedia entities mentioned in a corpus of textual assertions are linked, this can further enable the detection and fine-grained typing of the unlinkable entities. Our proposed method for detecting unlinkable entities achieves 24% greater accuracy than a Named Entity Recognition baseline, and our method for fine-grained typing is able to propagate over 1,000 types from linked Wikipedia entities to unlinkable entities. Detection and typing of unlinkable entities can increase yield for NLP applications such as typed question answering.</p><p>5 0.13669048 <a title="47-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Linking_Named_Entities_to_Any_Database.html">84 emnlp-2012-Linking Named Entities to Any Database</a></p>
<p>Author: Avirup Sil ; Ernest Cronin ; Penghai Nie ; Yinfei Yang ; Ana-Maria Popescu ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Existing techniques for disambiguating named entities in text mostly focus on Wikipedia as a target catalog of entities. Yet for many types of entities, such as restaurants and cult movies, relational databases exist that contain far more extensive information than Wikipedia. This paper introduces a new task, called Open-Database Named-Entity Disambiguation (Open-DB NED), in which a system must be able to resolve named entities to symbols in an arbitrary database, without requiring labeled data for each new database. We introduce two techniques for Open-DB NED, one based on distant supervision and the other based on domain adaptation. In experiments on two domains, one with poor coverage by Wikipedia and the other with near-perfect coverage, our Open-DB NED strategies outperform a state-of-the-art Wikipedia NED system by over 25% in accuracy.</p><p>6 0.1258928 <a title="47-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Natural_Language_Questions_for_the_Web_of_Data.html">97 emnlp-2012-Natural Language Questions for the Web of Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Vivi Nastase ; Alex Judea ; Katja Markert ; Michael Strube</p><p>Abstract: Computational approaches to metonymy resolution have focused almost exclusively on the local context, especially the constraints placed on a potentially metonymic word by its grammatical collocates. We expand such approaches by taking into account the larger context. Our algorithm is tested on the data from the metonymy resolution task (Task 8) at SemEval 2007. The results show that incorporation of the global context can improve over the use of the local context alone, depending on the types of metonymies addressed. As a second contribution, we move towards unsupervised resolution of metonymies, made feasible by considering ontological relations as possible readings. We show that such an unsupervised approach delivers promising results: it beats the supervised most frequent sense baseline and performs close to a supervised approach using only standard lexico-syntactic features.</p><p>3 0.61452317 <a title="47-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Reading_The_Web_with_Learned_Syntactic-Semantic_Inference_Rules.html">110 emnlp-2012-Reading The Web with Learned Syntactic-Semantic Inference Rules</a></p>

<p>Author: Hui Yang</p><p>Abstract: Taxonomies can serve as browsing tools for document collections. However, given an arbitrary collection, pre-constructed taxonomies could not easily adapt to the specific topic/task present in the collection. This paper explores techniques to quickly derive task-specific taxonomies supporting browsing in arbitrary document collections. The supervised approach directly learns semantic distances from users to propose meaningful task-specific taxonomies. The approach aims to produce globally optimized taxonomy structures by incorporating path consistency control and usergenerated task specification into the general learning framework. A comparison to stateof-the-art systems and a user study jointly demonstrate that our techniques are highly effective. .</p><p>5 0.57732731 <a title="47-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Name_Phylogeny%3A_A_Generative_Model_of_String_Variation.html">96 emnlp-2012-Name Phylogeny: A Generative Model of String Variation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas Andrews ; Jason Eisner ; Mark Dredze</p><p>Abstract: Many linguistic and textual processes involve transduction of strings. We show how to learn a stochastic transducer from an unorganized collection of strings (rather than string pairs). The role of the transducer is to organize the collection. Our generative model explains similarities among the strings by supposing that some strings in the collection were not generated ab initio, but were instead derived by transduction from other, “similar” strings in the collection. Our variational EM learning algorithm alternately reestimates this phylogeny and the transducer parameters. The final learned transducer can quickly link any test name into the final phylogeny, thereby locating variants of the test name. We find that our method can effectively find name variants in a corpus of web strings used to referto persons in Wikipedia, improving over standard untrained distances such as Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein distance.</p><p>6 0.54203206 <a title="47-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-No_Noun_Phrase_Left_Behind%3A_Detecting_and_Typing_Unlinkable_Entities.html">98 emnlp-2012-No Noun Phrase Left Behind: Detecting and Typing Unlinkable Entities</a></p>

<p>Author: Jianxing Yu ; Zheng-Jun Zha ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes to generate appropriate answers for opinion questions about products by exploiting the hierarchical organization of consumer reviews. The hierarchy organizes product aspects as nodes following their parent-child relations. For each aspect, the reviews and corresponding opinions on this aspect are stored. We develop a new framework for opinion Questions Answering, which enables accurate question analysis and effective answer generation by making use the hierarchy. In particular, we first identify the (explicit/implicit) product aspects asked in the questions and their sub-aspects by referring to the hierarchy. We then retrieve the corresponding review fragments relevant to the aspects from the hierarchy. In order to gener- ate appropriate answers from the review fragments, we develop a multi-criteria optimization approach for answer generation by simultaneously taking into account review salience, coherence, diversity, and parent-child relations among the aspects. We conduct evaluations on 11 popular products in four domains. The evaluated corpus contains 70,359 consumer reviews and 220 questions on these products. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>3 0.41632026 <a title="47-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Local_and_Global_Context_for_Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Metonymy_Resolution.html">85 emnlp-2012-Local and Global Context for Supervised and Unsupervised Metonymy Resolution</a></p>

The results show that incorporation of the global context can improve over the use of the local context alone, depending on the types of metonymies addressed. As a second contribution, we move towards unsupervised resolution of metonymies, made feasible by considering ontological relations as possible readings. We show that such an unsupervised approach delivers promising results: it beats the supervised most frequent sense baseline and performs close to a supervised approach using only standard lexico-syntactic features.</p><p>4 0.40643957 <a title="47-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Linking_Named_Entities_to_Any_Database.html">84 emnlp-2012-Linking Named Entities to Any Database</a></p>
<p>Author: Avirup Sil ; Ernest Cronin ; Penghai Nie ; Yinfei Yang ; Ana-Maria Popescu ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Existing techniques for disambiguating named entities in text mostly focus on Wikipedia as a target catalog of entities. Yet for many types of entities, such as restaurants and cult movies, relational databases exist that contain far more extensive information than Wikipedia. This paper introduces a new task, called Open-Database Named-Entity Disambiguation (Open-DB NED), in which a system must be able to resolve named entities to symbols in an arbitrary database, without requiring labeled data for each new database. We introduce two techniques for Open-DB NED, one based on distant supervision and the other based on domain adaptation. In experiments on two domains, one with poor coverage by Wikipedia and the other with near-perfect coverage, our Open-DB NED strategies outperform a state-of-the-art Wikipedia NED system by over 25% in accuracy.</p><p>5 0.40066242 <a title="47-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Reading_The_Web_with_Learned_Syntactic-Semantic_Inference_Rules.html">110 emnlp-2012-Reading The Web with Learned Syntactic-Semantic Inference Rules</a></p>
<p>Author: Ni Lao ; Amarnag Subramanya ; Fernando Pereira ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We study how to extend a large knowledge base (Freebase) by reading relational information from a large Web text corpus. Previous studies on extracting relational knowledge from text show the potential of syntactic patterns for extraction, but they do not exploit background knowledge of other relations in the knowledge base. We describe a distributed, Web-scale implementation of a path-constrained random walk model that learns syntactic-semantic inference rules for binary relations from a graph representation of the parsed text and the knowledge base. Experiments show significant accuracy improvements in binary relation prediction over methods that consider only text, or only the existing knowledge base.</p><p>6 0.3969653 <a title="47-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Constructing_Task-Specific_Taxonomies_for_Document_Collection_Browsing.html">30 emnlp-2012-Constructing Task-Specific Taxonomies for Document Collection Browsing</a></p>

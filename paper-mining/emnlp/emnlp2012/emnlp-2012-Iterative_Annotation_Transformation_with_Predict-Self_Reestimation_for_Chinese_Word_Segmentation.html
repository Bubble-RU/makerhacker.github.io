<p>Author: David Burkett ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We describe a transformation-based learning method for learning a sequence of monolingual tree transformations that improve the agreement between constituent trees and word alignments in bilingual corpora. Using the manually annotated English Chinese Translation Treebank, we show how our method automatically discovers transformations that accommodate differences in English and Chinese syntax. Furthermore, when transformations are learned on automatically generated trees and alignments from the same domain as the training data for a syntactic MT system, the transformed trees achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over baseline trees.</p><p>3 0.22667523 <a title="68-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Chinese_Word_Segmentation%2C_POS_Tagging_and_Parsing.html">70 emnlp-2012-Joint Chinese Word Segmentation, POS Tagging and Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Xian Qian ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel decoding algorithm for discriminative joint Chinese word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and parsing. Previous work often used a pipeline method Chinese word segmentation followed by POS tagging and parsing, which suffers from error propagation and is unable to leverage information in later modules for earlier components. In our approach, we train the three individual models separately during training, and incorporate them together in a unified framework during decoding. We extend the CYK parsing algorithm so that it can deal with word segmentation and POS tagging features. As far as we know, this is the first work on joint Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing. Our experimental results on Chinese Tree Bank 5 corpus show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art pipeline system. –</p><p>4 0.20654853 <a title="68-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Unified_Dependency_Parsing_of_Chinese_Morphological_and_Syntactic_Structures.html">131 emnlp-2012-Unified Dependency Parsing of Chinese Morphological and Syntactic Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongguo Li ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Most previous approaches to syntactic parsing of Chinese rely on a preprocessing step of word segmentation, thereby assuming there was a clearly defined boundary between morphology and syntax in Chinese. We show how this assumption can fail badly, leading to many out-of-vocabulary words and incompatible annotations. Hence in practice the strict separation of morphology and syntax in the Chinese language proves to be untenable. We present a unified dependency parsing approach for Chinese which takes unsegmented sentences as input and outputs both morphological and syntactic structures with a single model and algorithm. By removing the intermediate word segmentation, the unified parser no longer needs separate notions for words and phrases. Evaluation proves the effectiveness of the unified model and algorithm in parsing structures of words, phrases and sen- tences simultaneously. 1</p><p>5 0.14908616 <a title="68-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Part-of-Speech_Tagging_for_Chinese-English_Mixed_Texts_with_Dynamic_Features.html">106 emnlp-2012-Part-of-Speech Tagging for Chinese-English Mixed Texts with Dynamic Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Amit Goyal ; Hal Daume III ; Raul Guerra</p><p>Abstract: Many natural language processing problems involve constructing large nearest-neighbor graphs. We propose a system called FLAG to construct such graphs approximately from large data sets. To handle the large amount of data, our algorithm maintains approximate counts based on sketching algorithms. To find the approximate nearest neighbors, our algorithm pairs a new distributed online-PMI algorithm with novel fast approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms (variants of PLEB). These algorithms return the approximate nearest neighbors quickly. We show our system’s efficiency in both intrinsic and extrinsic experiments. We further evaluate our fast search algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively on two NLP applications.</p><p>3 0.65600908 <a title="68-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Part-of-Speech_Tagging_for_Chinese-English_Mixed_Texts_with_Dynamic_Features.html">106 emnlp-2012-Part-of-Speech Tagging for Chinese-English Mixed Texts with Dynamic Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Brianna Satinoff ; He He ; Hal Daume III</p><p>Abstract: Cost-sensitive classification, where thefeatures used in machine learning tasks have a cost, has been explored as a means of balancing knowledge against the expense of incrementally obtaining new features. We introduce a setting where humans engage in classification with incrementally revealed features: the collegiate trivia circuit. By providing the community with a web-based system to practice, we collected tens of thousands of implicit word-by-word ratings of how useful features are for eliciting correct answers. Observing humans’ classification process, we improve the performance of a state-of-the art classifier. We also use the dataset to evaluate a system to compete in the incremental classification task through a reduction of reinforcement learning to classification. Our system learns when to answer a question, performing better than baselines and most human players.</p><p>5 0.64821148 <a title="68-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Unified_Dependency_Parsing_of_Chinese_Morphological_and_Syntactic_Structures.html">131 emnlp-2012-Unified Dependency Parsing of Chinese Morphological and Syntactic Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongguo Li ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Most previous approaches to syntactic parsing of Chinese rely on a preprocessing step of word segmentation, thereby assuming there was a clearly defined boundary between morphology and syntax in Chinese. We show how this assumption can fail badly, leading to many out-of-vocabulary words and incompatible annotations. Hence in practice the strict separation of morphology and syntax in the Chinese language proves to be untenable. We present a unified dependency parsing approach for Chinese which takes unsegmented sentences as input and outputs both morphological and syntactic structures with a single model and algorithm. By removing the intermediate word segmentation, the unified parser no longer needs separate notions for words and phrases. Evaluation proves the effectiveness of the unified model and algorithm in parsing structures of words, phrases and sen- tences simultaneously. 1</p><p>6 0.64643204 <a title="68-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Building_a_Lightweight_Semantic_Model_for_Unsupervised_Information_Extraction_on_Short_Listings.html">26 emnlp-2012-Building a Lightweight Semantic Model for Unsupervised Information Extraction on Short Listings</a></p>

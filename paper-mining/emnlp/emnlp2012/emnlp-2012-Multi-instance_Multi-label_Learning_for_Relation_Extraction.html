<p>Author: Jayant Krishnamurthy ; Tom Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for training a semantic parser using only a knowledge base and an unlabeled text corpus, without any individually annotated sentences. Our key observation is that multiple forms ofweak supervision can be combined to train an accurate semantic parser: semantic supervision from a knowledge base, and syntactic supervision from dependencyparsed sentences. We apply our approach to train a semantic parser that uses 77 relations from Freebase in its knowledge representation. This semantic parser extracts instances of binary relations with state-of-theart accuracy, while simultaneously recovering much richer semantic structures, such as conjunctions of multiple relations with partially shared arguments. We demonstrate recovery of this richer structure by extracting logical forms from natural language queries against Freebase. On this task, the trained semantic parser achieves 80% precision and 56% recall, despite never having seen an annotated logical form.</p><p>3 0.13492973 <a title="93-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Unambiguity_Regularization_for_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Probabilistic_Grammars.html">130 emnlp-2012-Unambiguity Regularization for Unsupervised Learning of Probabilistic Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Kewei Tu ; Vasant Honavar</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach named unambiguity regularization for unsupervised learning of probabilistic natural language grammars. The approach is based on the observation that natural language is remarkably unambiguous in the sense that only a tiny portion of the large number of possible parses of a natural language sentence are syntactically valid. We incorporate an inductive bias into grammar learning in favor of grammars that lead to unambiguous parses on natural language sentences. The resulting family of algorithms includes the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM) and its variant, Viterbi EM, as well as a so-called softmax-EM algorithm. The softmax-EM algorithm can be implemented with a simple and computationally efficient extension to standard EM. In our experiments of unsupervised dependency grammar learn- ing, we show that unambiguity regularization is beneficial to learning, and in combination with annealing (of the regularization strength) and sparsity priors it leads to improvement over the current state of the art.</p><p>4 0.13333938 <a title="93-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Linking_Named_Entities_to_Any_Database.html">84 emnlp-2012-Linking Named Entities to Any Database</a></p>
<p>Author: Avirup Sil ; Ernest Cronin ; Penghai Nie ; Yinfei Yang ; Ana-Maria Popescu ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Existing techniques for disambiguating named entities in text mostly focus on Wikipedia as a target catalog of entities. Yet for many types of entities, such as restaurants and cult movies, relational databases exist that contain far more extensive information than Wikipedia. This paper introduces a new task, called Open-Database Named-Entity Disambiguation (Open-DB NED), in which a system must be able to resolve named entities to symbols in an arbitrary database, without requiring labeled data for each new database. We introduce two techniques for Open-DB NED, one based on distant supervision and the other based on domain adaptation. In experiments on two domains, one with poor coverage by Wikipedia and the other with near-perfect coverage, our Open-DB NED strategies outperform a state-of-the-art Wikipedia NED system by over 25% in accuracy.</p><p>5 0.1214166 <a title="93-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Name_Phylogeny%3A_A_Generative_Model_of_String_Variation.html">96 emnlp-2012-Name Phylogeny: A Generative Model of String Variation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas Andrews ; Jason Eisner ; Mark Dredze</p><p>Abstract: Many linguistic and textual processes involve transduction of strings. We show how to learn a stochastic transducer from an unorganized collection of strings (rather than string pairs). The role of the transducer is to organize the collection. Our generative model explains similarities among the strings by supposing that some strings in the collection were not generated ab initio, but were instead derived by transduction from other, “similar” strings in the collection. Our variational EM learning algorithm alternately reestimates this phylogeny and the transducer parameters. The final learned transducer can quickly link any test name into the final phylogeny, thereby locating variants of the test name. We find that our method can effectively find name variants in a corpus of web strings used to referto persons in Wikipedia, improving over standard untrained distances such as Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein distance.</p><p>6 0.11158165 <a title="93-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_Constraints_for_Consistent_Timeline_Extraction.html">77 emnlp-2012-Learning Constraints for Consistent Timeline Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Mausam ; Michael Schmitz ; Stephen Soderland ; Robert Bart ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Open Information Extraction (IE) systems extract relational tuples from text, without requiring a pre-specified vocabulary, by identifying relation phrases and associated arguments in arbitrary sentences. However, stateof-the-art Open IE systems such as REVERB and WOE share two important weaknesses (1) they extract only relations that are mediated by verbs, and (2) they ignore context, thus extracting tuples that are not asserted as factual. This paper presents OLLIE, a substantially improved Open IE system that addresses both these limitations. First, OLLIE achieves high yield by extracting relations mediated by nouns, adjectives, and more. Second, a context-analysis step increases precision by including contextual information from the sentence in the extractions. OLLIE obtains 2.7 times the area under precision-yield curve (AUC) compared to REVERB and 1.9 times the AUC of WOEparse. –</p><p>5 0.40465117 <a title="93-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Name_Phylogeny%3A_A_Generative_Model_of_String_Variation.html">96 emnlp-2012-Name Phylogeny: A Generative Model of String Variation</a></p>

<p>Author: Michaela Regneri ; Rui Wang</p><p>Abstract: Previous work on paraphrase extraction using parallel or comparable corpora has generally not considered the documents’ discourse structure as a useful information source. We propose a novel method for collecting paraphrases relying on the sequential event order in the discourse, using multiple sequence alignment with a semantic similarity measure. We show that adding discourse information boosts the performance of sentence-level paraphrase acquisition, which consequently gives a tremendous advantage for extracting phraselevel paraphrase fragments from matched sentences. Our system beats an informed baseline by a margin of 50%.</p><p>3 0.5191018 <a title="93-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Inference_for_Event_Timeline_Construction.html">72 emnlp-2012-Joint Inference for Event Timeline Construction</a></p>
<p>Author: Quang Do ; Wei Lu ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the task of constructing a timeline of events mentioned in a given text. To accomplish that, we present a novel representation of the temporal structure of a news article based on time intervals. We then present an algorithmic approach that jointly optimizes the temporal structure by coupling local classifiers that predict associations and temporal relations between pairs of temporal entities with global constraints. Moreover, we present ways to leverage knowledge provided by event coreference to further improve the system performance. Overall, our experiments show that the joint inference model significantly outperformed the local classifiers by 9.2% of relative improvement in F1. The experiments also suggest that good event coreference could make remarkable contribution to a robust event timeline construction system.</p><p>4 0.51668572 <a title="93-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Linking_Named_Entities_to_Any_Database.html">84 emnlp-2012-Linking Named Entities to Any Database</a></p>

Yet for many types of entities, such as restaurants and cult movies, relational databases exist that contain far more extensive information than Wikipedia. This paper introduces a new task, called Open-Database Named-Entity Disambiguation (Open-DB NED), in which a system must be able to resolve named entities to symbols in an arbitrary database, without requiring labeled data for each new database. We introduce two techniques for Open-DB NED, one based on distant supervision and the other based on domain adaptation. In experiments on two domains, one with poor coverage by Wikipedia and the other with near-perfect coverage, our Open-DB NED strategies outperform a state-of-the-art Wikipedia NED system by over 25% in accuracy.</p><p>5 0.5113458 <a title="93-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Weakly_Supervised_Training_of_Semantic_Parsers.html">136 emnlp-2012-Weakly Supervised Training of Semantic Parsers</a></p>
<p>Author: Jayant Krishnamurthy ; Tom Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for training a semantic parser using only a knowledge base and an unlabeled text corpus, without any individually annotated sentences. Our key observation is that multiple forms ofweak supervision can be combined to train an accurate semantic parser: semantic supervision from a knowledge base, and syntactic supervision from dependencyparsed sentences. We apply our approach to train a semantic parser that uses 77 relations from Freebase in its knowledge representation. This semantic parser extracts instances of binary relations with state-of-theart accuracy, while simultaneously recovering much richer semantic structures, such as conjunctions of multiple relations with partially shared arguments. We demonstrate recovery of this richer structure by extracting logical forms from natural language queries against Freebase. On this task, the trained semantic parser achieves 80% precision and 56% recall, despite never having seen an annotated logical form.</p><p>6 0.51004606 <a title="93-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Detecting_Subgroups_in_Online_Discussions_by_Modeling_Positive_and_Negative_Relations_among_Participants.html">32 emnlp-2012-Detecting Subgroups in Online Discussions by Modeling Positive and Negative Relations among Participants</a></p>

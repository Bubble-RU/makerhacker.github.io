<p>Author: Michael Roth ; Anette Frank</p><p>Abstract: Generating coherent discourse is an important aspect in natural language generation. Our aim is to learn factors that constitute coherent discourse from data, with a focus on how to realize predicate-argument structures in a model that exceeds the sentence level. We present an important subtask for this overall goal, in which we align predicates across comparable texts, admitting partial argument structure correspondence. The contribution of this work is two-fold: We first construct a large corpus resource of comparable texts, including an evaluation set with manual predicate alignments. Secondly, we present a novel approach for aligning predicates across comparable texts using graph-based clustering with Mincuts. Our method significantly outperforms other alignment techniques when applied to this novel alignment task, by a margin of at least 6.5 percentage points in F1-score.</p><p>3 0.12678067 <a title="80-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-N-gram-based_Tense_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">95 emnlp-2012-N-gram-based Tense Models for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Mausam ; Michael Schmitz ; Stephen Soderland ; Robert Bart ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Open Information Extraction (IE) systems extract relational tuples from text, without requiring a pre-specified vocabulary, by identifying relation phrases and associated arguments in arbitrary sentences. However, stateof-the-art Open IE systems such as REVERB and WOE share two important weaknesses (1) they extract only relations that are mediated by verbs, and (2) they ignore context, thus extracting tuples that are not asserted as factual. This paper presents OLLIE, a substantially improved Open IE system that addresses both these limitations. First, OLLIE achieves high yield by extracting relations mediated by nouns, adjectives, and more. Second, a context-analysis step increases precision by including contextual information from the sentence in the extractions. OLLIE obtains 2.7 times the area under precision-yield curve (AUC) compared to REVERB and 1.9 times the AUC of WOEparse. –</p><p>4 0.51123142 <a title="80-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Employing_Compositional_Semantics_and_Discourse_Consistency_in_Chinese_Event_Extraction.html">38 emnlp-2012-Employing Compositional Semantics and Discourse Consistency in Chinese Event Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Peifeng Li ; Guodong Zhou ; Qiaoming Zhu ; Libin Hou</p><p>Abstract: Current Chinese event extraction systems suffer much from two problems in trigger identification: unknown triggers and word segmentation errors to known triggers. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes two novel inference mechanisms to explore special characteristics in Chinese via compositional semantics inside Chinese triggers and discourse consistency between Chinese trigger mentions. Evaluation on the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus justifies the effectiveness of our approach over a strong baseline. 1</p><p>5 0.48858792 <a title="80-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2012-PATTY%3A_A_Taxonomy_of_Relational_Patterns_with_Semantic_Types.html">103 emnlp-2012-PATTY: A Taxonomy of Relational Patterns with Semantic Types</a></p>

The present state-of-the-art system uses gold standard information from previous decisions in its features, which, when removed, results in a large drop in performance. We treat the problem as a sequence labelling task, which allows us to incorporate sequence features without using gold standard information.

We propose a candidate ranking model for this-issue anaphora resolution that explores different issuespecific and general abstract-anaphora features. The model is not restricted to nominal or verbal antecedents; rather, it is able to identify antecedents that are arbitrary spans of text. Our results show that (a) the model outperforms the strong adjacent-sentence baseline; (b) general abstract-anaphora features, as distinguished from issue-specific features, play a crucial role in this-issue anaphora resolution, suggesting that our approach can be generalized for other NPs such as this problem and this debate; and (c) it is possible to reduce the search space in order to improve performance.</p><p>5 0.47776532 <a title="80-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Syntactic_Transfer_Using_a_Bilingual_Lexicon.html">123 emnlp-2012-Syntactic Transfer Using a Bilingual Lexicon</a></p>
<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Adam Pauls ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of using a bilingual dictionary to transfer lexico-syntactic information from a resource-rich source language to a resource-poor target language. In contrast to past work that used bitexts to transfer analyses of specific sentences at the token level, we instead use features to transfer the behavior of words at a type level. In a discriminative dependency parsing framework, our approach produces gains across a range of target languages, using two different lowresource training methodologies (one weakly supervised and one indirectly supervised) and two different dictionary sources (one manually constructed and one automatically constructed).</p><p>6 0.47304922 <a title="80-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Training_Factored_PCFGs_with_Expectation_Propagation.html">126 emnlp-2012-Training Factored PCFGs with Expectation Propagation</a></p>

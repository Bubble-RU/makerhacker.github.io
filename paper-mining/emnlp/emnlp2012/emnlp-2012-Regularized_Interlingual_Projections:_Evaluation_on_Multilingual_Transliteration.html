</p><p>4 We also propose a regularization framework for learning the interlingual representation, which  accounts for language specific phonemic variability, and thus it can find better mappings between languages. [sent-7, score-0.514]
</p><p>5 Experimental results on the name transliteration task in five diverse languages show a maximum improvement of 29% accuracy and an average improvement of 17% accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art baseline system. [sent-8, score-0.704]
</p><p>6 Similarly, bilingual dictionaries and transliteration data sets are more accessible from a language into English than into a different language. [sent-14, score-0.616]
</p><p>7 Previous studies in machine translation (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Paul and Sumita, 2011), transliteration (Khapra et al. [sent-16, score-0.505]
</p><p>8 In this paper, we propose a regularization framework for bridge language approaches and show its effectiveness for name transliteration task. [sent-19, score-0.806]
</p><p>9 Named entity (NE) transliteration involves transliterating a name in one language into another language and is shown to be crucial for machine translation (MT) (Knight and Graehl, 1998; AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002; Hermjakob et al. [sent-26, score-0.614]
</p><p>10 In this paper, we operate in the context of transliteration mining (Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Sproat et al. [sent-37, score-0.505]
</p><p>11 Given a set of l languages, we address the problem of building a transliteration system between every pair of languages. [sent-39, score-0.505]
</p><p>12 A straight forward supervised learning approach would require training data of name pairs between every pair of languages (Knight and Graehl, 1998) or a set of common names transliterated from every language into a pivot language. [sent-40, score-0.293]
</p><p>13 Bridge language approaches overcome the need for common names and build transliteration systems for resource poor languages (Khapra et al. [sent-42, score-0.673]
</p><p>14 However, such approaches still require training data consisting of bilingual name transliterations (orthographic name-to-name mappings). [sent-44, score-0.285]
</p><p>15 In  this paper, we relax the need for name transliterations by using international phonetic alphabet (IPA) in a manner akin to a “bridge language. [sent-45, score-0.272]
</p><p>16 We refer to the set of (word, IPA) pairs as phoneme dictionary in this paper. [sent-49, score-0.327]
</p><p>17 Since we only need a phoneme dictionary in each language, our approach does not require any bilingual resources to build the transliteration system. [sent-54, score-0.887]
</p><p>18 the phoneme dictionaries obtained from Wiktionary contain at least 2000 words in 21 languages and we will see in Sec. [sent-57, score-0.427]
</p><p>19 6 that we can build a decent transliteration system with 2000 words. [sent-58, score-0.505]
</p><p>20 2 Finally, unlike other transliteration approaches, by simply adding a phoneme dictionary of (l + 1)st language we can readily get a transliteration system into any of the existing llanguages and thus avoid the need for all-pairs data or computation. [sent-59, score-1.337]
</p><p>21 Using IPA as the bridge language poses some new challenges such as the language specific phonemic inventory. [sent-60, score-0.509]
</p><p>22 Besides this language specific phonemic inventory, names have different IPA representations in different languages. [sent-65, score-0.389]
</p><p>23 In order to handle this phonemic diversity, our method explicitly models language-specific variability and attempts to minimize this phonemic variabil2In our experiments, we consider languages with small (2000) and big (>30K) phoneme dictionaries. [sent-70, score-1.04]
</p><p>24 At a high level, our approach uses the phoneme dictionaries of each language to learn mapping functions into an interlingual representation (also referred as common subspace). [sent-76, score-0.487]
</p><p>25 Subsequently, given a pair of languages, a query name in one of the languages and a list of candidate transliterations in the other language, we use the mapping functions of those two language to identify the correct name transliteration. [sent-77, score-0.485]
</p><p>26 An important advantage of our approach is that, it extends easily to more than two languages and in fact adding phoneme dictionary from a different, but related, language improves the accuracies of a given language pair. [sent-80, score-0.417]
</p><p>27 Our main contributions are: 1) building a transliteration system using (word, IPA) pairs and hence using only monolingual resources and 2) proposing a regularization framework which is more  general and applies to other bridge language applications such as lexicon mining (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001). [sent-81, score-0.719]
</p><p>28 3  Low Dimensional Projections  Our approach is inspired by the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) (Hotelling, 1936) and its application to transliteration mining (Udupa and Khapra, 2010). [sent-82, score-0.505]
</p><p>29 First, we convert the phoneme dictionary of each language into feature vectors, i. [sent-83, score-0.327]
</p><p>30 ara Fctoerr barnedv tIyP,A w symbol sequences as character and phonemic spaces respectively. [sent-88, score-0.477]
</p><p>31 The character space is specific to each lan-  ××  guage while the phonemic space is shared across all the languages. [sent-89, score-0.454]
</p><p>32 Then), for each language, we find mappings (Ai and Ui) from the character and phonemic spa(ces into a co)mmon k-dimensional subspace such that( the correct )transliterations lie closer to each other in this subspace. [sent-93, score-0.477]
</p><p>33 of fea(tures) o)f the character space of the language and c is( the si)ze of the common phonemic space. [sent-99, score-0.408]
</p><p>34 During the testing stage, given a name xi in the source (ith) language, we find its transliteration in the target (jth) language xj by solving the following decoding problem:  R(c×k)  argxjminL(xi,xj)  R(di ×k)  (1)  Figure 1: A single name (Gandhi) is shown in all the input feature spaces. [sent-105, score-0.785]
</p><p>35 The alignment between the character and phonemic space is indicated with double dimensional arrows. [sent-106, score-0.408]
</p><p>36 Bridge-CCA uses a single mapping function U  from the phonemic space into the common subspace (the 2-dimensional green space at the top), where as our approach uses two mapping functions U1 and U2, one for each language, to map the IPA sequences into the common subspace. [sent-107, score-0.543]
</p><p>37 shows the name Gandhi (represented as point) in the character spaces of English and Hindi, three-dimensional spaces, and its IPA sequences in the phonemic space (the two-  15 dimensional space in the middle). [sent-114, score-0.636]
</p><p>38 Notice that, because of the phonemic variation, the same name is represented by two distinct points in the common phonemic space. [sent-115, score-0.749]
</p><p>39 As a result our approach successfully handles the language specific phonemic variation. [sent-118, score-0.341]
</p><p>40 At the same time we constrain the projection directions such that they behave similarly for the phonemic sounds that are observed in majority of the languages. [sent-119, score-0.482]
</p><p>41 1, our model (called Regularized Projections) finds two different mapping functions U1 and U2, one for each language, from the phonemic space into the common two-dimensional space at the bottom. [sent-121, score-0.426]
</p><p>42 Inspired by the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) (Hotelling, 1936), we find projection directions in the character and phonemic spaces of each language such that, after projection, a word is closer to its aligned IPA sequence. [sent-128, score-0.522]
</p><p>43 Then, we might try to find projection directions ai in each language and u in the common phonemic space such that:  argaim,uin∑i=l1(⟨xi,ai⟩ − ⟨pi,u⟩)2  (3)  where ⟨·, ·⟩ denotes the dot product between two vectors. [sent-133, score-0.485]
</p><p>44 ,T·h⟩is d menoodteesl assumes tphroatd tuhcet projection wdiorection u is same for the phonemic space of all the languages. [sent-134, score-0.397]
</p><p>45 In our model, intuitively, the parameters corresponding to the phonemic sounds that occur in majority of the languages are shared across the languages while the parameters of the language specific sounds are modeled per each language. [sent-137, score-0.667]
</p><p>46 This is achieved by modeling the projection directions of the ith language phonemic space ui ← u + ri. [sent-138, score-0.515]
</p><p>47 The vector u ∈ Rc is common to the phonemic spaces vofe atollr t uhe ∈ languages and thus handles sounds that are observed in multiple languages while ri ∈ Rc, the residual vector, is specific to each language aRnd  accounts for the language specific phonemic variations. [sent-139, score-1.127]
</p><p>48 By enforcing the residual vectors to be small, this formulation encourages the sounds that occur in majority of the languages to be accounted by u and the sounds that are specific to the given language by ri. [sent-142, score-0.38]
</p><p>49 These mappings are used in predicting the transliteration of a name in one language into any other language, which will be described in the following section. [sent-173, score-0.669]
</p><p>50 Formally, given a word xi in ith language we find its transliteration into jth language xj, by solving the optimization problem shown in Eq. [sent-177, score-0.553]
</p><p>51 Similar to the previous case, the closed form solution can be found by computing the first derivative with respect to the unknown phoneme sequence and the target language transliteration and setting it to z(ero. [sent-179, score-0.786]
</p><p>52 2 and then solve for xj, the best transliteration in the jth language, as: Aj(I−UjTCi−j1Uj)AjTxj  = AjUjTC−ij1UiAiTxi  (12)  S(ince Ui and Uj) are not full rank matrices, to increase the numerical stability of the prediction step, we use Cij = UiUiT+UjUjT+0. [sent-182, score-0.505]
</p><p>53 In transliteration, generative approaches aim to generate the target language transliteration of a given source name (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Jung et al. [sent-186, score-0.614]
</p><p>54 , 2004;  Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002) while discriminative approaches assume a list of target language names, obtained from other sources, and try to identify the correct transliteration (Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Sproat et al. [sent-188, score-0.505]
</p><p>55 Nevertheless, all these approaches require either bilingual name pairs or phoneme sequences to learn to transliterate between two languages. [sent-193, score-0.517]
</p><p>56 Thus, if we want to build a transliteration system between every pair of languages in a given set of languages then these approaches need resources between every pair of languages which can be prohibitive. [sent-194, score-0.775]
</p><p>57 , 2010) uses a single mapping function for the phonemic space of all the languages and thus it can not handle language specific variability. [sent-198, score-0.49]
</p><p>58 Approaches that map words in different languages into the common phonemic space have also been well studied. [sent-200, score-0.435]
</p><p>59 Similar to our approach these variants only require soundex mappings of a new language to build transliteration system, but our model does not require explicit mapping between n-gram characters and the IPA symbols instead it learns them automatically using phoneme dictionaries. [sent-206, score-0.911]
</p><p>60 6  Experiments  Our experiments are designed to evaluate the following three aspects of our model, and of our approach to transliteration in general: IPA as bridge: Unlike other phonemic based approaches (Sec. [sent-208, score-0.825]
</p><p>61 5), we do not explicitly model the phoneme modifications between pairs of languages. [sent-209, score-0.281]
</p><p>62 Moreover, the phoneme dictionary in each language is crawled from Wiktionary (Sec. [sent-210, score-0.327]
</p><p>63 Multilinguality: In our method, simply adding a phoneme dictionary of a new language allows us to extend our transliteration system into any of the existing languages. [sent-215, score-0.832]
</p><p>64 We evaluate the effect of data from  a different, but related, languages on a transliteration system between a given pair. [sent-216, score-0.595]
</p><p>65 Complementarity: Using IPA as bridge language allows us to build transliteration system into resource poor languages. [sent-217, score-0.703]
</p><p>66 But we also want to evaluate whether such an approach can help improving a transliteration system trained directly on bilingual name-pairs. [sent-218, score-0.56]
</p><p>67 The phoneme dictionaries (list of words and their IPA representations as shown in Table 1) are obtained from Wiktionary. [sent-221, score-0.337]
</p><p>68 In principle, our method allows us to build transliteration system into any of these language pairs without any additional information. [sent-226, score-0.505]
</p><p>69 Training data is monolingual phoneme dictionaries while development/test sets are bilingual name pairs between English and the respective language. [sent-234, score-0.523]
</p><p>70 Table 3 shows the sizes of phoneme dictionaries used for training the models. [sent-236, score-0.337]
</p><p>71 The phoneme dictionaries of English, Bulgarian, and Russian contain more than 30K (word,IPA) pairs while the remaining two languages have smaller phoneme dictionaries. [sent-237, score-0.708]
</p><p>72 2 Experimental Setup We convert the phoneme dictionaries of each language into feature vectors. [sent-241, score-0.337]
</p><p>73 We use unigram and bigram features in the phonemic space and unigram, bigram and trigram features in the character space. [sent-242, score-0.408]
</p><p>74 The phonemic space is common to all the languages and has 3777 features. [sent-248, score-0.435]
</p><p>75 Though the phonemic features are common to all the languages, as discussed in Sec. [sent-249, score-0.32]

</p><p>77 This indicates  the diversity in the phonemic inventory of different languages. [sent-255, score-0.342]
</p><p>78 We compare our approach against Bridge-CCA, a state-of-the-art bridge language transliteration system which is known to perform competitively with other discriminative approaches (Khapra et al. [sent-256, score-0.695]
</p><p>79 We use the phoneme dictionaries in each language to train our approach, as well as the baseline system. [sent-258, score-0.337]
</p><p>80 The projection directions learnt during the training are used to find the transliteration for a test name as described in Sec. [sent-259, score-0.703]
</p><p>81 We report the performance in terms of the accuracy (exact match) of the top ranked transliteration and the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the correct transliteration. [sent-262, score-0.505]

</p><p>85 Notice that even though our Russian phoneme dictionary has only 1141 (word, IPA) pairs, our approach is able to achieve an accuracy of 63. [sent-348, score-0.327]
</p><p>86 47% and an MRR of 73% indicating that the correct name transliteration is, on an average, at rank 1or 2. [sent-349, score-0.614]
</p><p>87 3 Complementarity In the final experiment, we want to compare the performance of our approach, which uses only monolingual resources, with a transliteration system trained using bilingual name pairs. [sent-359, score-0.691]
</p><p>88 We train a CCA based transliteration system (Udupa and Khapra,  AccE. [sent-360, score-0.505]
</p><p>89 15% and the average string edit distance of the returned transliteration to the true transliteration is about 3. [sent-389, score-1.01]
</p><p>90 These accura-  cies are not directly comparable to the results shown in Table 5 because, presumably, it is a transliteration generation system unlike CCA which is a transliteration mining approach. [sent-391, score-1.01]
</p><p>91 For lack fair comparison, we don’t report the accuracies of the Google transliteration output in Table 5. [sent-392, score-0.505]
</p><p>92 This experiment shows that a transliteration system trained on word and IPA representations can actually augment a system trained on bilingual name pairs lead-  ing to an improved performance. [sent-398, score-0.669]
</p><p>93 7  Conclusion  In this paper we proposed a regularization technique for the bridge language approaches and showed its effectiveness on the name transliteration task. [sent-399, score-0.806]
</p><p>94 Our approach learns interlingual representation using only monolingual resources and hence can be used to build transliteration system between resource poor languages. [sent-400, score-0.651]
</p><p>95 We show that, by accounting the language specific phonemic variation, we can get a significant improvements. [sent-401, score-0.341]
</p><p>96 Our experimental results suggest that a transliteration system built using IPA data can also help improve the accuracy of a transliteration system trained on bilingual name pairs. [sent-402, score-1.174]

<p>Author: Young-Bum Kim ; Benjamin Snyder</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of inducing grapheme-to-phoneme mappings for unknown languages written in a Latin alphabet. First, we collect a data-set of 107 languages with known grapheme-phoneme relationships, along with a short text in each language. We then cast our task in the framework of supervised learning, where each known language serves as a training example, and predictions are made on unknown languages. We induce an undirected graphical model that learns phonotactic regularities, thus relating textual patterns to plausible phonemic interpretations across the entire range of languages.

<p>Author: Nicholas Andrews ; Jason Eisner ; Mark Dredze</p><p>Abstract: Many linguistic and textual processes involve transduction of strings. We show how to learn a stochastic transducer from an unorganized collection of strings (rather than string pairs). The role of the transducer is to organize the collection. Our generative model explains similarities among the strings by supposing that some strings in the collection were not generated ab initio, but were instead derived by transduction from other, “similar” strings in the collection. Our variational EM learning algorithm alternately reestimates this phylogeny and the transducer parameters. The final learned transducer can quickly link any test name into the final phylogeny, thereby locating variants of the test name. We find that our method can effectively find name variants in a corpus of web strings used to referto persons in Wikipedia, improving over standard untrained distances such as Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein distance.</p><p>4 0.071086951 <a title="111-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Explore_Person_Specific_Evidence_in_Web_Person_Name_Disambiguation.html">47 emnlp-2012-Explore Person Specific Evidence in Web Person Name Disambiguation</a></p>

Our approach uses international phonetic alphabet (IPA) to learn the interlingual representation and thus allows us to use any word and its IPA representation as a training example. Thus, our approach requires only monolingual resources: a phoneme dictionary that lists words and their IPA representations.1 By adding a phoneme dictionary of a new language, we can readily build a transliteration system into any of the existing previous languages, without the expense of all-pairs data or computation. We also propose a regularization framework for learning the interlingual representation, which accounts for language specific phonemic variability, and thus it can find better mappings between languages.

<p>Author: Quang Do ; Wei Lu ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the task of constructing a timeline of events mentioned in a given text. To accomplish that, we present a novel representation of the temporal structure of a news article based on time intervals. We then present an algorithmic approach that jointly optimizes the temporal structure by coupling local classifiers that predict associations and temporal relations between pairs of temporal entities with global constraints. Moreover, we present ways to leverage knowledge provided by event coreference to further improve the system performance. Overall, our experiments show that the joint inference model significantly outperformed the local classifiers by 9.2% of relative improvement in F1. The experiments also suggest that good event coreference could make remarkable contribution to a robust event timeline construction system.</p><p>3 0.47598714 <a title="111-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Syntactic_Transfer_Using_a_Bilingual_Lexicon.html">123 emnlp-2012-Syntactic Transfer Using a Bilingual Lexicon</a></p>
<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Adam Pauls ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of using a bilingual dictionary to transfer lexico-syntactic information from a resource-rich source language to a resource-poor target language. In contrast to past work that used bitexts to transfer analyses of specific sentences at the token level, we instead use features to transfer the behavior of words at a type level. In a discriminative dependency parsing framework, our approach produces gains across a range of target languages, using two different lowresource training methodologies (one weakly supervised and one indirectly supervised) and two different dictionary sources (one manually constructed and one automatically constructed).</p><p>4 0.47348604 <a title="111-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Multi-Domain_Learning%3A_When_Do_Domains_Matter%3F.html">92 emnlp-2012-Multi-Domain Learning: When Do Domains Matter?</a></p>
<p>Author: Mahesh Joshi ; Mark Dredze ; William W. Cohen ; Carolyn Rose</p><p>Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of existing multi-domain learning approaches with respect to two questions. First, many multidomain learning algorithms resemble ensemble learning algorithms. (1) Are multi-domain learning improvements the result of ensemble learning effects? Second, these algorithms are traditionally evaluated in a balanced class label setting, although in practice many multidomain settings have domain-specific class label biases. When multi-domain learning is applied to these settings, (2) are multidomain methods improving because they capture domain-specific class biases? An understanding of these two issues presents a clearer idea about where the field has had success in multi-domain learning, and it suggests some important open questions for improving beyond the current state of the art.</p><p>5 0.47293583 <a title="111-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Biased_Representation_Learning_for_Domain_Adaptation.html">24 emnlp-2012-Biased Representation Learning for Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Huang ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Representation learning is a promising technique for discovering features that allow supervised classifiers to generalize from a source domain dataset to arbitrary new domains. We present a novel, formal statement of the representation learning task. We argue that because the task is computationally intractable in general, it is important for a representation learner to be able to incorporate expert knowledge during its search for helpful features. Leveraging the Posterior Regularization framework, we develop an architecture for incorporating biases into representation learning. We investigate three types of biases, and experiments on two domain adaptation tasks show that our biased learners identify significantly better sets of features than unbiased learners, resulting in a relative reduction in error of more than 16% for both tasks, with respect to existing state-of-the-art representation learning techniques.</p><p>6 0.47182998 <a title="111-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-An_Empirical_Investigation_of_Statistical_Significance_in_NLP.html">18 emnlp-2012-An Empirical Investigation of Statistical Significance in NLP</a></p>

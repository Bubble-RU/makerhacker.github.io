<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-83-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1004.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Stella Frank ; Frank Keller ; Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: Frank Keller keller@ inf .ed .ac .uk Sharon Goldwater sgwater@ inf .ed .ac .uk ILCC, School of Informatics University of Edinburgh Edinburgh, EH8 9AB, UK interactions are often (but not necessarily) synergisChildren learn various levels of linguistic structure concurrently, yet most existing models of language acquisition deal with only a single level of structure, implicitly assuming a sequential learning process. Developing models that learn multiple levels simultaneously can provide important insights into how these levels might interact synergistically dur- ing learning. Here, we present a model that jointly induces syntactic categories and morphological segmentations by combining two well-known models for the individual tasks. We test on child-directed utterances in English and Spanish and compare to single-task baselines. In the morphologically poorer language (English), the model improves morphological segmentation, while in the morphologically richer language (Spanish), it leads to better syntactic categorization. These results provide further evidence that joint learning is useful, but also suggest that the benefits may be different for typologically different languages.</p><br/>

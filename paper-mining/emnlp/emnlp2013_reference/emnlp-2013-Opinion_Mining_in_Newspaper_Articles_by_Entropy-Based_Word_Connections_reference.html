<h1>144 emnlp-2013-Opinion Mining in Newspaper Articles by Entropy-Based Word Connections</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-144-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1188.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Thomas Scholz ; Stefan Conrad</p><p>Abstract: A very valuable piece of information in newspaper articles is the tonality of extracted statements. For the analysis of tonality of newspaper articles either a big human effort is needed, when it is carried out by media analysts, or an automated approach which has to be as accurate as possible for a Media Response Analysis (MRA). To this end, we will compare several state-of-the-art approaches for Opinion Mining in newspaper articles in this paper. Furthermore, we will introduce a new technique to extract entropy-based word connections which identifies the word combinations which create a tonality. In the evaluation, we use two different corpora consisting of news articles, by which we show that the new approach achieves better results than the four state-of-the-art methods.</p><br/>

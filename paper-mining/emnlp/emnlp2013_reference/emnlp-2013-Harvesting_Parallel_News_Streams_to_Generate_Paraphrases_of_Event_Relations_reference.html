<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-93-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1183.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Congle Zhang ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: The distributional hypothesis, which states that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings, has inspired several Web mining algorithms for paraphrasing semantically equivalent phrases. Unfortunately, these methods have several drawbacks, such as confusing synonyms with antonyms and causes with effects. This paper introduces three Temporal Correspondence Heuristics, that characterize regularities in parallel news streams, and shows how they may be used to generate high precision paraphrases for event relations. We encode the heuristics in a probabilistic graphical model to create the NEWSSPIKE algorithm for mining news streams. We present experiments demonstrating that NEWSSPIKE significantly outperforms several competitive baselines. In order to spur further research, we provide a large annotated corpus of timestamped news arti- cles as well as the paraphrases produced by NEWSSPIKE.</p><br/>

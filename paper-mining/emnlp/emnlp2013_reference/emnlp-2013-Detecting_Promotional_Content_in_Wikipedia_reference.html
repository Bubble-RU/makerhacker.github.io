<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-61-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1190.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Shruti Bhosale ; Heath Vinicombe ; Raymond Mooney</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach for detecting promotional content in Wikipedia. By incorporating stylometric features, including features based on n-gram and PCFG language models, we demonstrate improved accuracy at identifying promotional articles, compared to using only lexical information and metafeatures.</p><br/>

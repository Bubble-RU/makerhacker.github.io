<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-51-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1136.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Jason Weston ; Antoine Bordes ; Oksana Yakhnenko ; Nicolas Usunier</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for relation extraction from free text which is trained to jointly use information from the text and from existing knowledge. Our model is based on scoring functions that operate by learning low-dimensional embeddings of words, entities and relationships from a knowledge base. We empirically show on New York Times articles aligned with Freebase relations that our approach is able to efficiently use the extra information provided by a large subset of Freebase data (4M entities, 23k relationships) to improve over methods that rely on text features alone.</p><br/>

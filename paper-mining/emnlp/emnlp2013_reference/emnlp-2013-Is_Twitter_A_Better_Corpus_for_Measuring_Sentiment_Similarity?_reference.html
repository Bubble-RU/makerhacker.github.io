<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-109-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1091.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Shi Feng ; Le Zhang ; Binyang Li ; Daling Wang ; Ge Yu ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of the corpus-based method for classifying the word’s sentiment polarity. However, no work is done for comparing different corpora in the polarity classification task. Nowadays, Twitter has aggregated huge amount of data that are full of people’s sentiments. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the performance of different corpora in sentiment similarity measurement, which is the fundamental task for word polarity classification. Experiment results show that the Twitter data can achieve a much better performance than the Google, Web1T and Wikipedia based methods.</p><br/>

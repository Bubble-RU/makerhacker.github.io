<h1>76 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Discourse Analysis for Article-Wide Temporal Classification</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-76-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1002.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Jun-Ping Ng ; Min-Yen Kan ; Ziheng Lin ; Wei Feng ; Bin Chen ; Jian Su ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we classify the temporal relations between pairs of events on an article-wide basis. This is in contrast to much of the existing literature which focuses on just event pairs which are found within the same or adjacent sentences. To achieve this, we leverage on discourse analysis as we believe that it provides more useful semantic information than typical lexico-syntactic features. We propose the use of several discourse analysis frameworks, including 1) Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), 2) PDTB-styled discourse relations, and 3) topical text segmentation. We explain how features derived from these frameworks can be effectively used with support vector machines (SVM) paired with convolution kernels. Experiments show that our proposal is effective in improving on the state-of-the-art significantly by as much as 16% in terms of F1, even if we only adopt less-than-perfect automatic discourse analyzers and parsers. Making use of more accurate discourse analysis can further boost gains to 35%.</p><br/>

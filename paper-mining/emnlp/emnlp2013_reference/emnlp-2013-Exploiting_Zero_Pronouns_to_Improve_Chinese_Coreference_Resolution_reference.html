<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-80-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1028.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Fang Kong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Coreference resolution plays a critical role in discourse analysis. This paper focuses on exploiting zero pronouns to improve Chinese coreference resolution. In particular, a simplified semantic role labeling framework is proposed to identify clauses and to detect zero pronouns effectively, and two effective methods (refining syntactic parser and refining learning example generation) are employed to exploit zero pronouns for Chinese coreference resolution. Evaluation on the CoNLL-2012 shared task data set shows that zero pronouns can significantly improve Chinese coreference resolution.</p><br/>

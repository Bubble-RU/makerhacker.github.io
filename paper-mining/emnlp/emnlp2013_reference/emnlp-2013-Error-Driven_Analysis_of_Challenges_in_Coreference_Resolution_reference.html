<h1>73 emnlp-2013-Error-Driven Analysis of Challenges in Coreference Resolution</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-73-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1027.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Coreference resolution metrics quantify errors but do not analyze them. Here, we consider an automated method of categorizing errors in the output of a coreference system into intuitive underlying error types. Using this tool, we first compare the error distributions across a large set of systems, then analyze common errors across the top ten systems, empirically characterizing the major unsolved challenges of the coreference resolution task.</p><br/>

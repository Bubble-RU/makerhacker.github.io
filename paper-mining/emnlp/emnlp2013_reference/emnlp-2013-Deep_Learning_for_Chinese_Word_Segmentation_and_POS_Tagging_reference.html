<h1>56 emnlp-2013-Deep Learning for Chinese Word Segmentation and POS Tagging</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-56-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1061.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Xiaoqing Zheng ; Hanyang Chen ; Tianyu Xu</p><p>Abstract: This study explores the feasibility of performing Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and POS tagging by deep learning. We try to avoid task-specific feature engineering, and use deep layers of neural networks to discover relevant features to the tasks. We leverage large-scale unlabeled data to improve internal representation of Chinese characters, and use these improved representations to enhance supervised word segmentation and POS tagging models. Our networks achieved close to state-of-theart performance with minimal computational cost. We also describe a perceptron-style algorithm for training the neural networks, as an alternative to maximum-likelihood method, to speed up the training process and make the learning algorithm easier to be implemented.</p><br/>

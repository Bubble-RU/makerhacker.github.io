<h1>57 emnlp-2013-Dependency-Based Decipherment for Resource-Limited Machine Translation</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-57-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1173.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Qing Dou ; Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: We introduce dependency relations into deciphering foreign languages and show that dependency relations help improve the state-ofthe-art deciphering accuracy by over 500%. We learn a translation lexicon from large amounts of genuinely non parallel data with decipherment to improve a phrase-based machine translation system trained with limited parallel data. In experiments, we observe BLEU gains of 1.2 to 1.8 across three different test sets.</p><br/>

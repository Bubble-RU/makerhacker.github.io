Most recent efforts along this line are not scalable (training on the small dev set with features from top ∼100 most frequent wt woridths) f eaantdu overly complicated. oWste f iren-stead present a very simple yet theoretically motivated approach by extending the recent framework of “violation-fixing perceptron”, using forced decoding to compute the target derivations. Extensive phrase-based translation experiments on both Chinese-to-English and Spanish-to-English tasks show substantial gains in BLEU by up to +2.3/+2.0 on dev/test over MERT, thanks to 20M+ sparse features. This is the first successful effort of large-scale online discriminative training for MT. 1Introduction Large-scale discriminative training has witnessed great success in many NLP problems such as parsing (McDonald et al., 2005) and tagging (Collins, 2002), but not yet for machine translation (MT) despite numerous recent efforts. Due to scalability issues, most of these recent methods can only train on a small dev set of about a thousand sentences rather than on the full training set, and only with 2,000–10,000 rather “dense-like” features (either unlexicalized or only considering highest-frequency words), as in MIRA (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008; Chiang, 2012), PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011), and RAMP (Gimpel and Smith, 2012). However, it is well-known that the most important features for NLP are lexicalized, most of which can not ∗ Work done while visiting City University of New York.

Furthermore, these methods often involve complicated loss functions and intricate choices of the “target” derivations to update towards or against (e.g. k-best/forest oracles, or hope/fear derivations), and are thus hard to replicate. As a result, the classical method of MERT (Och, 2003) remains the default training algorithm for MT even though it can only tune a handful of dense features. See also Section 6 for other related work. As a notable exception, Liang et al. (2006) do train a structured perceptron model on the training data with sparse features, but fail to outperform MERT. We argue this is because structured perceptron, like many structured learning algorithms such as CRF and MIRA, assumes exact search, and search errors inevitably break theoretical properties such as convergence (Huang et al., 2012). Empirically, it is now well accepted that standard perceptron performs poorly when search error is severe (Collins and Roark, 2004; Zhang et al., 2013). To address the search error problem we propose a very simple approach based on the recent framework of “violation-fixing perceptron” (Huang et al., 2012) which is designed specifically for inexact search, with a theoretical convergence guarantee and excellent empirical performance on beam search parsing and tagging. The basic idea is to update when search error happens, rather than at the end of the search. To adapt it to MT, we extend this framework to handle latent variables corresponding to the hidden derivations. We update towards “gold-standard” derivations computed by forced decoding so that each derivation leads to the exact reference translation. Forced decoding is also used as a way of data selection, since those reachable sentence pairs are generally more literal and of higher quality, which the training should focus on. When the reachable subset is small for some language pairs, we augment Proce Sdeiantgtlse o,f W thaesh 2i0n1gt3o nC,o UnSfeAre,n 1c8e- o2n1 E Omctpoibriecra 2l0 M13et.h ?oc d2s0 i1n3 N Aastusorcaila Ltiaon g fuoarg Ceo Pmrpoucetastsi on ga,l p Laignegsu 1is1t1ic2s–1 23, it by including reachable prefix-pairs when the full sentence pair is not. We make the following contributions: 1. Our work is the first successful effort to scale online structured learning to a large portion of the training data (as opposed to the dev set). 2. Our work is the first to use a principled learning method customized for inexact search which updates on partial derivations rather than full ones in order to fix search errors. We adapt it to MT using latent variables for derivations. 3. Contrary to the common wisdom, we show that simply updating towards the exact reference translation is helpful, which is much simpler than k-best/forest oracles or loss-augmented (e.g. hope/fear) derivations, avoiding sentencelevel BLEU scores or other loss functions. 4. We present a convincing analysis that it is the search errors and standard perceptron’s inability to deal with them that prevent previous work, esp. Liang et al. (2006), from succeeding. 5. Scaling to the training data enables us to engineer a very rich feature set of sparse, lexicalized, and non-local features, and we propose various ways to alleviate overfitting. For simplicity and efficiency reasons, in this paper we use phrase-based translation, but our method has the potential to be applicable to other translation paradigms. Extensive experiments on both Chineseto-English and Spanish-to-English tasks show statistically significant gains in BLEU by up to +2.3/+2.0 on dev/test over MERT, and up to +1.5/+1.5 over PRO, thanks to 20M+ sparse features. 2 Phrase-Based MT and Forced Decoding We first review the basic phrase-based decoding algorithm (Koehn, 2004), which will be adapted for forced decoding. 2.1 Background: Phrase-based Decoding We will use the following running example from Chinese to English from Mi et al. (2008): 0123456 Figure 1: Standard beam-search phrase-based decoding. B `ush´ ı y uˇ Sh¯ al´ ong j ˇux ´ıng le hu` ıt´ an Bush with Sharon hold -ed meeting ‘Bush held a meeting with Sharon’ Phrase-based decoders generate partial targetlanguage outputs in left-to-right order in the form of hypotheses (or states) (Koehn, 2004). Each hypothesis has a coverage vector capturing the sourcelanguage words translated so far, and can be extended into a longer hypothesis by a phrase-pair translating an uncovered segment. For example, the following is one possible derivation: (• 3(• •() • :1( •s063),:“(Bs)u2s:,h)“(hBs:e1ul(d,s0“ht,aB“hleuk”ls) hdw”t)ailhkrsS1”h)aro2n”)r3 where a • in the coverage vector indicates the source wwoherdre a at •th i ns position aisg e“ vcoecvteorred in”d iacnadte ws thheer seo euarcche si is the score of each state, each adding the rule score and the distortion cost (dc) to the score of the previous state. To compute the distortion cost we also need to maintain the ending position of the last phrase (e.g., the 3 and 6 in the coverage vectors). In phrase-based translation there is also a distortionlimit which prohibits long-distance reorderings. The above states are called −LM states since they do Tnhoet ainbovovleve st language mlleodd −el LcMos tsst.a eTso iandcde a beiygram model, we split each −LM state into a series ogrfa +mL mMo states; ee sapchli t+ eaLcMh −staLtMe h satsa ttehe in ftoor ma (v,a) where a is the last word of the hypothesis.

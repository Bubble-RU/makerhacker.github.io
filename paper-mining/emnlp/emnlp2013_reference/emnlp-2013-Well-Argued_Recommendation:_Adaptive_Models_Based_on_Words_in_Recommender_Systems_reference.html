<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-200-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1200.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Julien Gaillard ; Marc El-Beze ; Eitan Altman ; Emmanuel Ethis</p><p>Abstract: Recommendation systems (RS) take advantage ofproducts and users information in order to propose items to consumers. Collaborative, content-based and a few hybrid RS have been developed in the past. In contrast, we propose a new domain-independent semantic RS. By providing textually well-argued recommendations, we aim to give more responsibility to the end user in his decision. The system includes a new similarity measure keeping up both the accuracy of rating predictions and coverage. We propose an innovative way to apply a fast adaptation scheme at a semantic level, providing recommendations and arguments in phase with the very recent past. We have performed several experiments on films data, providing textually well-argued recommendations.</p><br/>

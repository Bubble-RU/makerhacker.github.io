<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-130-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1085.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Yuhang Guo ; Bing Qin ; Ting Liu ; Sheng Li</p><p>Abstract: Linking name mentions in microblog posts to a knowledge base, namely microblog entity linking, is useful for text mining tasks on microblog. Entity linking in long text has been well studied in previous works. However few work has focused on short text such as microblog post. Microblog posts are short and noisy. Previous method can extract few features from the post context. In this paper we propose to use extra posts for the microblog entity linking task. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves the linking accuracy over traditional methods by 8.3% and 7.5% respectively.</p><br/>

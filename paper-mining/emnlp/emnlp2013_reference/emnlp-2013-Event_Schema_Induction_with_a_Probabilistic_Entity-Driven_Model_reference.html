<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-75-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1185.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Nathanael Chambers</p><p>Abstract: Event schema induction is the task of learning high-level representations of complex events (e.g., a bombing) and their entity roles (e.g., perpetrator and victim) from unlabeled text. Event schemas have important connections to early NLP research on frames and scripts, as well as modern applications like template extraction. Recent research suggests event schemas can be learned from raw text. Inspired by a pipelined learner based on named entity coreference, this paper presents the first generative model for schema induction that integrates coreference chains into learning. Our generative model is conceptually simpler than the pipelined approach and requires far less training data. It also provides an interesting contrast with a recent HMM-based model. We evaluate on a common dataset for template schema extraction. Our generative model matches the pipeline’s performance, and outperforms the HMM by 7 F1 points (20%).</p><br/>

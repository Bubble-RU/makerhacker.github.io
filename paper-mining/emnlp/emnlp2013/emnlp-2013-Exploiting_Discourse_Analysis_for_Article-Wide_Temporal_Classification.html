<p>Author: Gary Patterson ; Andrew Kehler</p><p>Abstract: We present a classification model that predicts the presence or omission of a lexical connective between two clauses, based upon linguistic features of the clauses and the type of discourse relation holding between them. The model is trained on a set of high frequency relations extracted from the Penn Discourse Treebank and achieves an accuracy of 86.6%. Analysis of the results reveals that the most informative features relate to the discourse dependencies between sequences of coherence relations in the text. We also present results of an experiment that provides insight into the nature and difficulty of the task.</p><p>3 0.21909639 <a title="76-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Building_Event_Threads_out_of_Multiple_News_Articles.html">41 emnlp-2013-Building Event Threads out of Multiple News Articles</a></p>
<p>Author: Xavier Tannier ; Veronique Moriceau</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach for building multidocument event threads from a large corpus of newswire articles. An event thread is basically a succession of events belonging to the same story. It helps the reader to contextualize the information contained in a single article, by navigating backward or forward in the thread from this article. A specific effort is also made on the detection of reactions to a particular event. In order to build these event threads, we use a cascade of classifiers and other modules, taking advantage of the redundancy of information in the newswire corpus. We also share interesting comments concerning our manual annotation procedure for building a training and testing set1.</p><p>4 0.20060085 <a title="76-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Event-Based_Time_Label_Propagation_for_Automatic_Dating_of_News_Articles.html">74 emnlp-2013-Event-Based Time Label Propagation for Automatic Dating of News Articles</a></p>
<p>Author: Tao Ge ; Baobao Chang ; Sujian Li ; Zhifang Sui</p><p>Abstract: Since many applications such as timeline summaries and temporal IR involving temporal analysis rely on document timestamps, the task of automatic dating of documents has been increasingly important. Instead of using feature-based methods as conventional models, our method attempts to date documents in a year level by exploiting relative temporal relations between documents and events, which are very effective for dating documents. Based on this intuition, we proposed an eventbased time label propagation model called confidence boosting in which time label information can be propagated between documents and events on a bipartite graph. The experiments show that our event-based propagation model can predict document timestamps in high accuracy and the model combined with a MaxEnt classifier outperforms the state-ofthe-art method for this task especially when the size of the training set is small.</p><p>5 0.19803683 <a title="76-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Single-Document_Summarization_as_a_Tree_Knapsack_Problem.html">174 emnlp-2013-Single-Document Summarization as a Tree Knapsack Problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Tsutomu Hirao ; Yasuhisa Yoshida ; Masaaki Nishino ; Norihito Yasuda ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies on extractive text summarization formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem such as a Knapsack Problem, a Maximum Coverage Problem or a Budgeted Median Problem. These methods successfully improved summarization quality, but they did not consider the rhetorical relations between the textual units of a source document. Thus, summaries generated by these methods may lack logical coherence. This paper proposes a single document summarization method based on the trimming of a discourse tree. This is a two-fold process. First, we propose rules for transforming a rhetorical structure theorybased discourse tree into a dependency-based discourse tree, which allows us to take a tree- . trimming approach to summarization. Second, we formulate the problem of trimming a dependency-based discourse tree as a Tree Knapsack Problem, then solve it with integer linear programming (ILP). Evaluation results showed that our method improved ROUGE scores.</p><p>6 0.16813332 <a title="76-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Harvesting_Parallel_News_Streams_to_Generate_Paraphrases_of_Event_Relations.html">93 emnlp-2013-Harvesting Parallel News Streams to Generate Paraphrases of Event Relations</a></p>

<p>Author: Aju Thalappillil Scaria ; Jonathan Berant ; Mengqiu Wang ; Peter Clark ; Justin Lewis ; Brittany Harding ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Biological processes are complex phenomena involving a series of events that are related to one another through various relationships. Systems that can understand and reason over biological processes would dramatically improve the performance of semantic applications involving inference such as question answering (QA) – specifically “How? ” and “Why? ” questions. In this paper, we present the task of process extraction, in which events within a process and the relations between the events are automatically extracted from text. We represent processes by graphs whose edges describe a set oftemporal, causal and co-reference event-event relations, and characterize the structural properties of these graphs (e.g., the graphs are connected). Then, we present a method for extracting relations between the events, which exploits these structural properties by performing joint in- ference over the set of extracted relations. On a novel dataset containing 148 descriptions of biological processes (released with this paper), we show significant improvement comparing to baselines that disregard process structure.</p><p>6 0.56646389 <a title="76-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Predicting_the_Presence_of_Discourse_Connectives.html">152 emnlp-2013-Predicting the Presence of Discourse Connectives</a></p>

<p>Author: Kai-Wei Chang ; Wen-tau Yih ; Christopher Meek</p><p>Abstract: We present Multi-Relational Latent Semantic Analysis (MRLSA) which generalizes Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). MRLSA provides an elegant approach to combining multiple relations between words by constructing a 3-way tensor. Similar to LSA, a lowrank approximation of the tensor is derived using a tensor decomposition. Each word in the vocabulary is thus represented by a vector in the latent semantic space and each relation is captured by a latent square matrix. The degree of two words having a specific relation can then be measured through simple linear algebraic operations. We demonstrate that by integrating multiple relations from both homogeneous and heterogeneous information sources, MRLSA achieves state- of-the-art performance on existing benchmark datasets for two relations, antonymy and is-a.</p><p>2 0.84233063 <a title="76-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Semi-Markov_Phrase-Based_Monolingual_Alignment.html">167 emnlp-2013-Semi-Markov Phrase-Based Monolingual Alignment</a></p>

This is in contrast to much of the existing literature which focuses on just event pairs which are found within the same or adjacent sentences. To achieve this, we leverage on discourse analysis as we believe that it provides more useful semantic information than typical lexico-syntactic features. We propose the use of several discourse analysis frameworks, including 1) Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), 2) PDTB-styled discourse relations, and 3) topical text segmentation. We explain how features derived from these frameworks can be effectively used with support vector machines (SVM) paired with convolution kernels. Experiments show that our proposal is effective in improving on the state-of-the-art significantly by as much as 16% in terms of F1, even if we only adopt less-than-perfect automatic discourse analyzers and parsers. Making use of more accurate discourse analysis can further boost gains to 35%.</p><p>4 0.75265658 <a title="76-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Unsupervised_Induction_of_Contingent_Event_Pairs_from_Film_Scenes.html">192 emnlp-2013-Unsupervised Induction of Contingent Event Pairs from Film Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhichao Hu ; Elahe Rahimtoroghi ; Larissa Munishkina ; Reid Swanson ; Marilyn A. Walker</p><p>Abstract: Human engagement in narrative is partially driven by reasoning about discourse relations between narrative events, and the expectations about what is likely to happen next that results from such reasoning. Researchers in NLP have tackled modeling such expectations from a range of perspectives, including treating it as the inference of the CONTINGENT discourse relation, or as a type of common-sense causal reasoning. Our approach is to model likelihood between events by drawing on several of these lines of previous work. We implement and evaluate different unsupervised methods for learning event pairs that are likely to be CONTINGENT on one another. We refine event pairs that we learn from a corpus of film scene descriptions utilizing web search counts, and evaluate our results by collecting human judgments ofcontingency. Our results indicate that the use of web search counts increases the av- , erage accuracy of our best method to 85.64% over a baseline of 50%, as compared to an average accuracy of 75. 15% without web search.</p><p>5 0.75179589 <a title="76-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatic_Feature_Engineering_for_Answer_Selection_and_Extraction.html">31 emnlp-2013-Automatic Feature Engineering for Answer Selection and Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Aliaksei Severyn ; Alessandro Moschitti</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for automatically engineering features for two important tasks of question answering: answer sentence selection and answer extraction. We represent question and answer sentence pairs with linguistic structures enriched by semantic information, where the latter is produced by automatic classifiers, e.g., question classifier and Named Entity Recognizer. Tree kernels applied to such structures enable a simple way to generate highly discriminative structural features that combine syntactic and semantic information encoded in the input trees. We conduct experiments on a public benchmark from TREC to compare with previous systems for answer sentence selection and answer extraction. The results show that our models greatly improve on the state of the art, e.g., up to 22% on F1 (relative improvement) for answer extraction, while using no additional resources and no manual feature engineering.</p><p>6 0.75168622 <a title="76-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploring_the_Utility_of_Joint_Morphological_and_Syntactic_Learning_from_Child-directed_Speech.html">83 emnlp-2013-Exploring the Utility of Joint Morphological and Syntactic Learning from Child-directed Speech</a></p>

<p>Author: Victor Chahuneau ; Eva Schlinger ; Noah A. Smith ; Chris Dyer</p><p>Abstract: Translation into morphologically rich languages is an important but recalcitrant problem in MT. We present a simple and effective approach that deals with the problem in two phases. First, a discriminative model is learned to predict inflections of target words from rich source-side annotations. Then, this model is used to create additional sentencespecific word- and phrase-level translations that are added to a standard translation model as “synthetic” phrases. Our approach relies on morphological analysis of the target language, but we show that an unsupervised Bayesian model of morphology can successfully be used in place of a supervised analyzer.

<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Bowen Zhou ; Bing Xiang</p><p>Abstract: Reordering poses one of the greatest challenges in Statistical Machine Translation research as the key contextual information may well be beyond the confine oftranslation units. We present the “Anchor Graph” (AG) model where we use a graph structure to model global contextual information that is crucial for reordering. The key ingredient of our AG model is the edges that capture the relationship between the reordering around a set of selected translation units, which we refer to as anchors. As the edges link anchors that may span multiple translation units at decoding time, our AG model effectively encodes global contextual information that is previously absent. We integrate our proposed model into a state-of-the-art translation system and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal in a largescale Chinese-to-English translation task.</p><p>2 0.94721156 <a title="83-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Dynamic_Feature_Selection_for_Dependency_Parsing.html">66 emnlp-2013-Dynamic Feature Selection for Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: He He ; Hal Daume III ; Jason Eisner</p><p>Abstract: Feature computation and exhaustive search have significantly restricted the speed of graph-based dependency parsing. We propose a faster framework of dynamic feature selection, where features are added sequentially as needed, edges are pruned early, and decisions are made online for each sentence. We model this as a sequential decision-making problem and solve it by imitation learning techniques. We test our method on 7 languages. Our dynamic parser can achieve accuracies comparable or even superior to parsers using a full set of features, while computing fewer than 30% of the feature templates.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.93400812 <a title="83-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploring_the_Utility_of_Joint_Morphological_and_Syntactic_Learning_from_Child-directed_Speech.html">83 emnlp-2013-Exploring the Utility of Joint Morphological and Syntactic Learning from Child-directed Speech</a></p>

<p>Author: Mike Lewis ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: Creating a language-independent meaning representation would benefit many crosslingual NLP tasks. We introduce the first unsupervised approach to this problem, learning clusters of semantically equivalent English and French relations between referring expressions, based on their named-entity arguments in large monolingual corpora. The clusters can be used as language-independent semantic relations, by mapping clustered expressions in different languages onto the same relation. Our approach needs no parallel text for training, but outperforms a baseline that uses machine translation on a cross-lingual question answering task. We also show how to use the semantics to improve the accuracy of machine translation, by using it in a simple reranker.</p><p>5 0.9202286 <a title="83-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatic_Feature_Engineering_for_Answer_Selection_and_Extraction.html">31 emnlp-2013-Automatic Feature Engineering for Answer Selection and Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Aliaksei Severyn ; Alessandro Moschitti</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for automatically engineering features for two important tasks of question answering: answer sentence selection and answer extraction. We represent question and answer sentence pairs with linguistic structures enriched by semantic information, where the latter is produced by automatic classifiers, e.g., question classifier and Named Entity Recognizer. Tree kernels applied to such structures enable a simple way to generate highly discriminative structural features that combine syntactic and semantic information encoded in the input trees. We conduct experiments on a public benchmark from TREC to compare with previous systems for answer sentence selection and answer extraction. The results show that our models greatly improve on the state of the art, e.g., up to 22% on F1 (relative improvement) for answer extraction, while using no additional resources and no manual feature engineering.</p><p>6 0.91797799 <a title="83-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Deep_Models_for_Semantic_Compositionality_Over_a_Sentiment_Treebank.html">158 emnlp-2013-Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank</a></p>

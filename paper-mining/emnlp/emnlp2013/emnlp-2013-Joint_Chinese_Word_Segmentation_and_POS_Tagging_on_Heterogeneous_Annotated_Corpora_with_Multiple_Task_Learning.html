<p>Author: Fan Yang ; Paul Vozila</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we report an empirical study on semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation using co-training. We utilize two segmenters: 1) a word-based segmenter leveraging a word-level language model, and 2) a character-based segmenter using characterlevel features within a CRF-based sequence labeler. These two segmenters are initially trained with a small amount of segmented data, and then iteratively improve each other using the large amount of unlabelled data. Our experimental results show that co-training captures 20% and 31% of the performance improvement achieved by supervised training with an order of magnitude more data for the SIGHAN Bakeoff 2005 PKU and CU corpora respectively.</p><p>4 0.15416741 <a title="111-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploring_Representations_from_Unlabeled_Data_with_Co-training_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation.html">82 emnlp-2013-Exploring Representations from Unlabeled Data with Co-training for Chinese Word Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Longkai Zhang ; Houfeng Wang ; Xu Sun ; Mairgup Mansur</p><p>Abstract: Nowadays supervised sequence labeling models can reach competitive performance on the task of Chinese word segmentation. However, the ability of these models is restricted by the availability of annotated data and the design of features. We propose a scalable semi-supervised feature engineering approach. In contrast to previous works using pre-defined taskspecific features with fixed values, we dynamically extract representations of label distributions from both an in-domain corpus and an out-of-domain corpus. We update the representation values with a semi-supervised approach. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our approach achieve good results and reach an f-score of 0.961. The feature engineering approach proposed here is a general iterative semi-supervised method and not limited to the word segmentation task.</p><p>5 0.11099294 <a title="111-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised_Feature_Transformation_for_Dependency_Parsing.html">168 emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised Feature Transformation for Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenliang Chen ; Min Zhang ; Yue Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In current dependency parsing models, conventional features (i.e. base features) defined over surface words and part-of-speech tags in a relatively high-dimensional feature space may suffer from the data sparseness problem and thus exhibit less discriminative power on unseen data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach to addressing the problem by transforming the base features into high-level features (i.e. meta features) with the help of a large amount of automatically parsed data. The meta features are used together with base features in our final parser. Our studies indicate that our proposed approach is very effective in processing unseen data and features. Experiments on Chinese and English data sets show that the final parser achieves the best-reported accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known parsers on the English data.</p><p>6 0.082412034 <a title="111-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Opinion_Target_Extraction_in_Chinese_Microblogs.html">47 emnlp-2013-Collective Opinion Target Extraction in Chinese Microblogs</a></p>

<p>Author: Jesus Gonzalez-Rubio ; Daniel Ortiz-Martinez ; Jose-Miguel Benedi ; Francisco Casacuberta</p><p>Abstract: Current automatic machine translation systems are not able to generate error-free translations and human intervention is often required to correct their output. Alternatively, an interactive framework that integrates the human knowledge into the translation process has been presented in previous works. Here, we describe a new interactive machine translation approach that is able to work with phrase-based and hierarchical translation models, and integrates error-correction all in a unified statistical framework. In our experiments, our approach outperforms previous interactive translation systems, and achieves estimated effort reductions of as much as 48% relative over a traditional post-edition system.</p><p>3 0.55962384 <a title="111-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Max-Margin_Synchronous_Grammar_Induction_for_Machine_Translation.html">127 emnlp-2013-Max-Margin Synchronous Grammar Induction for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Traditional synchronous grammar induction estimates parameters by maximizing likelihood, which only has a loose relation to translation quality. Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>4 0.55835205 <a title="111-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Document_Summarization_via_Guided_Sentence_Compression.html">65 emnlp-2013-Document Summarization via Guided Sentence Compression</a></p>
<p>Author: Chen Li ; Fei Liu ; Fuliang Weng ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: Joint compression and summarization has been used recently to generate high quality summaries. However, such word-based joint optimization is computationally expensive. In this paper we adopt the ‘sentence compression + sentence selection’ pipeline approach for compressive summarization, but propose to perform summary guided compression, rather than generic sentence-based compression. To create an annotated corpus, the human annotators were asked to compress sentences while explicitly given the important summary words in the sentences. Using this corpus, we train a supervised sentence compression model using a set of word-, syntax-, and documentlevel features. During summarization, we use multiple compressed sentences in the integer linear programming framework to select . salient summary sentences. Our results on the TAC 2008 and 2011 summarization data sets show that by incorporating the guided sentence compression model, our summarization system can yield significant performance gain as compared to the state-of-the-art.</p><p>5 0.55558491 <a title="111-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised_Feature_Transformation_for_Dependency_Parsing.html">168 emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised Feature Transformation for Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenliang Chen ; Min Zhang ; Yue Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In current dependency parsing models, conventional features (i.e. base features) defined over surface words and part-of-speech tags in a relatively high-dimensional feature space may suffer from the data sparseness problem and thus exhibit less discriminative power on unseen data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach to addressing the problem by transforming the base features into high-level features (i.e. meta features) with the help of a large amount of automatically parsed data. The meta features are used together with base features in our final parser. Our studies indicate that our proposed approach is very effective in processing unseen data and features. Experiments on Chinese and English data sets show that the final parser achieves the best-reported accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known parsers on the English data.</p><p>6 0.55076605 <a title="111-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Overcoming_the_Lack_of_Parallel_Data_in_Sentence_Compression.html">149 emnlp-2013-Overcoming the Lack of Parallel Data in Sentence Compression</a></p>

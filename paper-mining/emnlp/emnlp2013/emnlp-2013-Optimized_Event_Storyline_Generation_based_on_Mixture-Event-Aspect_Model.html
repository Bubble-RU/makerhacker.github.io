<p>Author: Shize Xu ; Shanshan Wang ; Yan Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The rapid development of Web2.0 leads to significant information redundancy. Especially for a complex news event, it is difficult to understand its general idea within a single coherent picture. A complex event often contains branches, intertwining narratives and side news which are all called storylines. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to tackle the challenging problem of storylines extraction and reconstruction. Specifically, we first investigate two requisite properties of an ideal storyline. Then a unified algorithm is devised to extract all effective storylines by optimizing these properties at the same time. Finally, we reconstruct all extracted lines and generate the high-quality story map. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method is quite efficient and highly competitive, which can bring about quicker, clearer and deeper comprehension to readers.</p><p>3 0.12897404 <a title="147-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Domain_Knowledge_in_Aspect_Extraction.html">77 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Aspect Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiyuan Chen ; Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu ; Meichun Hsu ; Malu Castellanos ; Riddhiman Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical models have been used for the task. However, such models without any domain knowledge often produce aspects that are not interpretable in applications. To tackle the issue, some knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which allow the user to input some prior domain knowledge to generate coherent aspects. However, existing knowledge-based topic models have several major shortcomings, e.g., little work has been done to incorporate the cannot-link type of knowledge or to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that MCLDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models markedly.</p><p>4 0.10038653 <a title="147-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Unified_Model_for_Topics%2C_Events_and_Users_on_Twitter.html">16 emnlp-2013-A Unified Model for Topics, Events and Users on Twitter</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiming Diao ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of social media, Twitter has become one of the most widely adopted platforms for people to post short and instant message. On the one hand, people tweets about their daily lives, and on the other hand, when major events happen, people also follow and tweet about them. Moreover, people’s posting behaviors on events are often closely tied to their personal interests. In this paper, we try to model topics, events and users on Twitter in a unified way. We propose a model which combines an LDA-like topic model and the Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Process to capture topics and events. We further propose a duration-based regularization component to find bursty events. We also propose to use event-topic affinity vectors to model the asso- . ciation between events and topics. Our experiments shows that our model can accurately identify meaningful events and the event-topic affinity vectors are effective for event recommendation and grouping events by topics.</p><p>5 0.096008085 <a title="147-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Harvesting_Parallel_News_Streams_to_Generate_Paraphrases_of_Event_Relations.html">93 emnlp-2013-Harvesting Parallel News Streams to Generate Paraphrases of Event Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Congle Zhang ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: The distributional hypothesis, which states that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings, has inspired several Web mining algorithms for paraphrasing semantically equivalent phrases. Unfortunately, these methods have several drawbacks, such as confusing synonyms with antonyms and causes with effects. This paper introduces three Temporal Correspondence Heuristics, that characterize regularities in parallel news streams, and shows how they may be used to generate high precision paraphrases for event relations. We encode the heuristics in a probabilistic graphical model to create the NEWSSPIKE algorithm for mining news streams. We present experiments demonstrating that NEWSSPIKE significantly outperforms several competitive baselines. In order to spur further research, we provide a large annotated corpus of timestamped news arti- cles as well as the paraphrases produced by NEWSSPIKE.</p><p>6 0.09203393 <a title="147-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatically_Determining_a_Proper_Length_for_Multi-Document_Summarization%3A_A_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Approach.html">36 emnlp-2013-Automatically Determining a Proper Length for Multi-Document Summarization: A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Tengfei Ma ; Hiroshi Nakagawa</p><p>Abstract: Document summarization is an important task in the area of natural language processing, which aims to extract the most important information from a single document or a cluster of documents. In various summarization tasks, the summary length is manually defined. However, how to find the proper summary length is quite a problem; and keeping all summaries restricted to the same length is not always a good choice. It is obviously improper to generate summaries with the same length for two clusters of documents which contain quite different quantity of information. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model for multidocument summarization in order to automatically determine the proper lengths of summaries. Assuming that an original document can be reconstructed from its summary, we describe the ”reconstruction” by a Bayesian framework which selects sentences to form a good summary. Experimental results on DUC2004 data sets and some expanded data demonstrate the good quality of our summaries and the rationality of the length determination.</p><p>4 0.40507102 <a title="147-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Personal_Profile_Summarization_with_Social_Networks.html">48 emnlp-2013-Collective Personal Profile Summarization with Social Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>5 0.40506873 <a title="147-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Domain_Knowledge_in_Aspect_Extraction.html">77 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Aspect Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Aju Thalappillil Scaria ; Jonathan Berant ; Mengqiu Wang ; Peter Clark ; Justin Lewis ; Brittany Harding ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Biological processes are complex phenomena involving a series of events that are related to one another through various relationships. Systems that can understand and reason over biological processes would dramatically improve the performance of semantic applications involving inference such as question answering (QA) – specifically “How? ” and “Why? ” questions. In this paper, we present the task of process extraction, in which events within a process and the relations between the events are automatically extracted from text. We represent processes by graphs whose edges describe a set oftemporal, causal and co-reference event-event relations, and characterize the structural properties of these graphs (e.g., the graphs are connected). Then, we present a method for extracting relations between the events, which exploits these structural properties by performing joint in- ference over the set of extracted relations. On a novel dataset containing 148 descriptions of biological processes (released with this paper), we show significant improvement comparing to baselines that disregard process structure.</p><p>3 0.57007164 <a title="147-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Implicit_Feature_Detection_via_a_Constrained_Topic_Model_and_SVM.html">99 emnlp-2013-Implicit Feature Detection via a Constrained Topic Model and SVM</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Wang ; Hua Xu ; Xiaoqiu Huang</p><p>Abstract: Implicit feature detection, also known as implicit feature identification, is an essential aspect of feature-specific opinion mining but previous works have often ignored it. We think, based on the explicit sentences, several Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers can be established to do this task. Nevertheless, we believe it is possible to do better by using a constrained topic model instead of traditional attribute selection methods. Experiments show that this method outperforms the traditional attribute selection methods by a large margin and the detection task can be completed better.</p><p>4 0.41351649 <a title="147-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Summarizing_Complex_Events%3A_a_Cross-Modal_Solution_of_Storylines_Extraction_and_Reconstruction.html">179 emnlp-2013-Summarizing Complex Events: a Cross-Modal Solution of Storylines Extraction and Reconstruction</a></p>
<p>Author: Shize Xu ; Shanshan Wang ; Yan Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The rapid development of Web2.0 leads to significant information redundancy. Especially for a complex news event, it is difficult to understand its general idea within a single coherent picture. A complex event often contains branches, intertwining narratives and side news which are all called storylines. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to tackle the challenging problem of storylines extraction and reconstruction. Specifically, we first investigate two requisite properties of an ideal storyline. Then a unified algorithm is devised to extract all effective storylines by optimizing these properties at the same time. Finally, we reconstruct all extracted lines and generate the high-quality story map. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method is quite efficient and highly competitive, which can bring about quicker, clearer and deeper comprehension to readers.</p><p>5 0.38890684 <a title="147-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Left-to-Right_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation_with_Improved_Reordering.html">71 emnlp-2013-Efficient Left-to-Right Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation with Improved Reordering</a></p>
<p>Author: Maryam Siahbani ; Baskaran Sankaran ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: Left-to-right (LR) decoding (Watanabe et al., 2006b) is a promising decoding algorithm for hierarchical phrase-based translation (Hiero). It generates the target sentence by extending the hypotheses only on the right edge. LR decoding has complexity O(n2b) for input of n words and beam size b, compared to O(n3) for the CKY algorithm. It requires a single language model (LM) history for each target hypothesis rather than two LM histories per hypothesis as in CKY. In this paper we present an augmented LR decoding algorithm that builds on the original algorithm in (Watanabe et al., 2006b). Unlike that algorithm, using experiments over multiple language pairs we show two new results: our LR decoding algorithm provides demonstrably more efficient decoding than CKY Hiero, four times faster; and by introducing new distortion and reordering features for LR decoding, it maintains the same translation quality (as in BLEU scores) ob- tained phrase-based and CKY Hiero with the same translation model.</p><p>6 0.38862276 <a title="147-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Personal_Profile_Summarization_with_Social_Networks.html">48 emnlp-2013-Collective Personal Profile Summarization with Social Networks</a></p>

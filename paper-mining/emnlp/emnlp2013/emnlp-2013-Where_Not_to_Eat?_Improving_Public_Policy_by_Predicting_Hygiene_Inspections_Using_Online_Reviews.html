</p><p>5 Our study suggests that public disclosure policy can be improved by mining public opinions from social media to target inspections and to provide alternative forms of disclosure to customers. [sent-8, score-0.615]
</p><p>6 1 Introduction Public health inspection records help customers to be wary of restaurants that have violated health codes. [sent-9, score-1.249]

</p><p>11 However, one practical challenge in the current inspection system is that the department of health has only limited resources to dispatch inspectors, leaving out a large number of restaurants with unknown hygiene grades. [sent-20, score-1.381]
</p><p>12 We postulate that online reviews written by the very citizens who have visited those restaurants can serve as a proxy for predicting the likely outcome of the health inspection of any given restaurant. [sent-21, score-1.303]
</p><p>13 Such a prediction model can complement the current inspection system by enlightening the department of health to make a more informed decision when allocating inspectors, and by guiding customers when choosing restaurants. [sent-22, score-0.578]

</p><p>23 For each restaurant, there are typically several inspection records. [sent-57, score-0.366]
</p><p>24 We defined an “inspection period” of each inspection record as the period of time starting from the day after the previous inspection to the day of the current inspection. [sent-58, score-0.795]
</p><p>25 If there is no previous inspection, then the period stretches to the past 6 months in time. [sent-59, score-0.063]
</p><p>26 Each inspection period corresponds to an instance in the training or test set. [sent-60, score-0.429]
</p><p>27 We merge all reviews within an inspection period into one document when creating the feature vector. [sent-61, score-0.679]
</p><p>28 Note that non-zero penalty scores may not necessarily indicate alarming hygiene issues. [sent-62, score-0.504]
</p><p>29 For example, violating codes such as “proper labeling” or “proper consumer advisorypostedfor raw or undercookedfoods seem relatively minor, and unlikely to be noted and mentioned by reviewers. [sent-63, score-0.094]
</p><p>30 Therefore, we focus on restaurants with severe violations, as they  ”  are exactly the set of restaurants that inspectors and customers need to pay the most attention to. [sent-64, score-1.17]
</p><p>31 To define restaurants with ”severe violations” we experiment with a varying threshold t, such that restaurants with score ≥ t are labeled as  “unhygienic”. [sent-65, score-0.996]
</p><p>32 2  3  Correlates of Inspection Penalty Scores  We examine correlation between penalty scores and several statistics of reviews: I. [sent-66, score-0.183]
</p><p>33 Volume of Reviews: 2For restaurants with “hygienic” labels, we only consider those without violation, as there are enough number of such restaurants to keep balanced distribution between two classes. [sent-67, score-0.96]
</p><p>34 37 Inspection Penalty Score Threshold  Figure 3: Trend of penalty score thresholds & accuracies. [sent-74, score-0.101]
</p><p>35 • •  count of all reviews average length of all reviews  II. [sent-75, score-0.5]
</p><p>36 Sentiment of Reviews: We examine whether the overall sentiment of the customers correlates with the hygiene of the restaurants based on following measures: • •  average review rating count of negative (≤ 3) reviews  III. [sent-76, score-1.438]
</p><p>37 Deceptiveness of Reviews: Restaurants with bad hygiene status are more likely to attract negative reviews, which would then motivate the restaurants to solicit fake reviews. [sent-77, score-0.928]
</p><p>38 But it is also possible that some of the most assiduous restaurants that abide by health codes strictly are also diligent in soliciting fake positive reviews. [sent-78, score-0.689]
</p><p>39 We therefore examine the correlation between hygiene violations and the degree of deception as follows. [sent-79, score-0.634]
</p><p>40 •  bimodal distribution of review ratings The work of Feng et al. [sent-80, score-0.09]
</p><p>41 (2012) has shown that the shape of the distribution of opinions, overtly skewed bimodal distributions in particular, can be a telltale sign of deceptive review-  •  ing activities. [sent-81, score-0.179]
</p><p>42 We approximately measure this by computing the variance of review ratings. [sent-82, score-0.055]
</p><p>43 volume of deceptive reviews based on linguistic patterns We also explore the use of deception classifiers based on linguistic patterns (Ott et al. [sent-83, score-0.49]
</p><p>44 Since no deception corpus is available in the restaurant domain, we collected a set of fake reviews and truthful reviews (250 reviews for each class), following Ott et al. [sent-85, score-1.044]
</p><p>45 3  310 fold cross validation on this dataset yields 79. [sent-87, score-0.023]
</p><p>46 1445  Respective Mean Squared Errors(MSE) & Squared Correlation Coefficients (SCC), np=non-positive Filtering Reviews: When computing above statistics over the set of reviews corresponding to each restaurant, we also consider removing a subset of reviews that might be dubious or just noise. [sent-89, score-0.5]
</p><p>47 In particular, we remove reviews that are too far away (delta ≥ 2) from the average review rating. [sent-90, score-0.305]

</p><p>49 s A thnaott are ciltlears-sified as deceptive by the deception classifier ex-  plained above. [sent-92, score-0.24]
</p><p>50 For brevity, we only show results based on the first filtering rule, as we did not find notable differences in different filtering strategies. [sent-93, score-0.056]
</p><p>51 Results: Fig 1and 2 show Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient with respect to the statistics listed above, with and without filtering, computed at different threshold cutoffs ∈ {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50} of inspection scores. [sent-94, score-0.478]
</p><p>52 w In Fig 1, as expected, average review rating is negatively correlated with the inspection penalty scores. [sent-98, score-0.578]
</p><p>53 Interestingly, all three statistics corresponding to the volume of customer reviews are positively correlated with inspection penalty. [sent-99, score-0.616]
</p><p>54 What is more interesting is that if potentially deceptive reviews are filtered, then the correlation gets stronger, which suggests the existence of deceptive reviews covering up unhappy customers. [sent-100, score-0.832]
</p><p>55 Also notice that correlation is 4Spearman’s coefficient assumes monotonic correlation. [sent-101, score-0.044]
</p><p>56 We suspect that the actual correlation ofthese factors and inspection scores are not entirely monotonic. [sent-102, score-0.41]
</p><p>57 generally stronger when higher cutoffs are used (xaxis), as expected. [sent-103, score-0.032]
</p><p>58 Fig 2 looks at the relation between the deception level and the inspection scores more directly. [sent-104, score-0.462]
</p><p>59 As suspected, restaurants with high  penalty scores show increased level of deceptive reviews. [sent-105, score-0.725]
</p><p>60 Although various correlates of hygiene scores examined so far are insightful, these alone are not informative enough to be used as a predictive tool, hence we explore content-based classification next. [sent-106, score-0.492]
</p><p>61 4  Content-based Prediction  We examine the utility of the following features: Features based on customers’ opinion: 1. [sent-107, score-0.072]
</p><p>62 Inspection History: a boolean feature (“hygienic” or “unhygienic”), a numerical feature (previous penalty score rescaled ∈ [0, 1]), a num(preerivci fuesa tpuernea (average penalty score over aullprevious inspections) 1446  6. [sent-114, score-0.202]
</p><p>63 We filter reviews that are farther than 2 from the average rating. [sent-118, score-0.25]
</p><p>64 Table 1 shows feature ablation at threshold t = 50, and ‘*’ denotes statistically significant (p≤0. [sent-122, score-0.036]
</p><p>65 We find that metadata information of restaurants such as location and cuisine alone show good predictive power, both above 66%, which are significantly higher than the expected accuracy of random guessing (50%). [sent-125, score-0.601]
</p><p>66 Somewhat unexpected outcome is aggregated opinion, which is the average review rating during the corresponding inspection period, as it performs not much better than chance (57. [sent-126, score-0.529]
</p><p>67 This result suggest that the task of hygiene prediction from reviews differs from the task of sentiment classification of reviews. [sent-128, score-0.696]
</p><p>68 Interestingly, the inspection history feature alone is highly informative, reaching accuracy upto 72%, suggesting that the past performance is a good predictor of the future performance. [sent-129, score-0.426]
</p><p>69 Textual content of the reviews (unigram+bigram) turns out to be the most effective features, reaching upto 82. [sent-130, score-0.31]
</p><p>70 1 Insightful Cues Table 2 and 3 shows representative lexical cues for each class with example sentences excerpted from actual reviews when context can be helpful. [sent-135, score-0.283]
</p><p>71 Hygiene: Interestingly, hygiene related words are overwhelmingly negative, e. [sent-136, score-0.403]
</p><p>72 What this suggests is that reviewers do complain when the restaurants are noticeably dirty, but do not seem to feel the need to complement on cleanliness as often. [sent-139, score-0.538]
</p><p>73 Instead, they seem to focus on other positive aspects of their experience, e. [sent-140, score-0.035]
</p><p>74 Service and Atmosphere: Discriminative features reveal that it is not just the hygiene related words that are predictive of the inspection results of restaurants. [sent-143, score-0.825]
</p><p>75 It turns out that there are other qualities of restaurants, such as service and atmosphere, that also correlate with the likely outcome of inspections. [sent-144, score-0.052]
</p><p>76 In contrast, words such as “selection ”, “atmosphere ”, “ambiance ” are predictive of hygienic restaurants, even including those with slightly negative connotation such as “attitude ” or “pretentious ”. [sent-146, score-0.116]
</p><p>77 Whom and When: If reviewers talk about details oftheir social occasions such as “date ”, “husband”, it seems to be a good sign. [sent-147, score-0.037]
</p><p>78 The way food items are described: Another interesting aspect of discriminative words are the way food items are described by reviewers. [sent-148, score-0.104]
</p><p>79 , “noodle ”, “egg ”, “soy” do not seem like a good sign. [sent-151, score-0.035]
</p><p>80 Cuisines: Finally, cuisines have clear correlations with inspection outcome, as shown in Table 2 and 3. [sent-155, score-0.406]
</p><p>81 1447  5  Related Work  There have been several recent studies that probe the viability of public health surveillance by measuring relevant textual signals in social media, in particular, micro-blogs (e. [sent-156, score-0.348]
</p><p>82 , influenza or food-poisoning by paying attention to a relatively small set of keywords that are directly relevant to the corresponding sickness. [sent-169, score-0.06]
</p><p>83 In contrast, we examine all words people use in online reviews, and draw insights on correlating terms and concepts that may not seem immediately relevant to the hygiene status of restaurants, but nonetheless are predictive of the outcome of the inspections. [sent-170, score-0.584]
</p><p>84 Second, our work is the first to examine online reviews in the context of improving public policy, suggesting additional source of information for public policy makers to pay attention to. [sent-171, score-0.536]
</p><p>85 Our work draws from the rich body of research  that studies online reviews for sentiment analysis (e. [sent-172, score-0.317]

<p>Author: Jiwei Li ; Myle Ott ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has developed supervised methods for detecting deceptive opinion spam— fake reviews written to sound authentic and deliberately mislead readers. And whereas past work has focused on identifying individual fake reviews, this paper aims to identify offerings (e.g., hotels) that contain fake reviews. We introduce a semi-supervised manifold ranking algorithm for this task, which relies on a small set of labeled individual reviews for training. Then, in the absence of gold standard labels (at an offering level), we introduce a novel evaluation procedure that ranks artificial instances of real offerings, where each artificial offering contains a known number of injected deceptive reviews. Experiments on a novel dataset of hotel reviews show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-art learning baselines.</p><p>3 0.11107975 <a title="202-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Improvements_to_the_Bayesian_Topic_N-Gram_Models.html">100 emnlp-2013-Improvements to the Bayesian Topic N-Gram Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Hiroshi Noji ; Daichi Mochihashi ; Yusuke Miyao</p><p>Abstract: One of the language phenomena that n-gram language model fails to capture is the topic information of a given situation. We advance the previous study of the Bayesian topic language model by Wallach (2006) in two directions: one, investigating new priors to alleviate the sparseness problem caused by dividing all ngrams into exclusive topics, and two, developing a novel Gibbs sampler that enables moving multiple n-grams across different documents to another topic. Our blocked sampler can efficiently search for higher probability space even with higher order n-grams. In terms of modeling assumption, we found it is effective to assign a topic to only some parts of a document.</p><p>4 0.054109961 <a title="202-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Domain_Knowledge_in_Aspect_Extraction.html">77 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Aspect Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiyuan Chen ; Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu ; Meichun Hsu ; Malu Castellanos ; Riddhiman Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical models have been used for the task. However, such models without any domain knowledge often produce aspects that are not interpretable in applications. To tackle the issue, some knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which allow the user to input some prior domain knowledge to generate coherent aspects. However, existing knowledge-based topic models have several major shortcomings, e.g., little work has been done to incorporate the cannot-link type of knowledge or to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that MCLDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models markedly.</p><p>5 0.052921634 <a title="202-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Open_Domain_Targeted_Sentiment.html">143 emnlp-2013-Open Domain Targeted Sentiment</a></p>
<p>Author: Margaret Mitchell ; Jacqui Aguilar ; Theresa Wilson ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to sentiment analysis for a low resource setting. The intuition behind this work is that sentiment expressed towards an entity, targeted sentiment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment expressed across the entity. This representation allows us to model sentiment detection as a sequence tagging problem, jointly discovering people and organizations along with whether there is sentiment directed towards them. We compare performance in both Spanish and English on microblog data, using only a sentiment lexicon as an external resource. By leveraging linguisticallyinformed features within conditional random fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empirical risk, our best models in Spanish significantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach around 90% accuracy on the combined task of named entity recognition and sentiment prediction. Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.</p><p>6 0.052430041 <a title="202-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatic_Domain_Partitioning_for_Multi-Domain_Learning.html">29 emnlp-2013-Automatic Domain Partitioning for Multi-Domain Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiwei Li ; Myle Ott ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has developed supervised methods for detecting deceptive opinion spam— fake reviews written to sound authentic and deliberately mislead readers. And whereas past work has focused on identifying individual fake reviews, this paper aims to identify offerings (e.g., hotels) that contain fake reviews. We introduce a semi-supervised manifold ranking algorithm for this task, which relies on a small set of labeled individual reviews for training. Then, in the absence of gold standard labels (at an offering level), we introduce a novel evaluation procedure that ranks artificial instances of real offerings, where each artificial offering contains a known number of injected deceptive reviews. Experiments on a novel dataset of hotel reviews show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-art learning baselines.</p><p>3 0.39023092 <a title="202-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-This_Text_Has_the_Scent_of_Starbucks%3A_A_Laplacian_Structured_Sparsity_Model_for_Computational_Branding_Analytics.html">184 emnlp-2013-This Text Has the Scent of Starbucks: A Laplacian Structured Sparsity Model for Computational Branding Analytics</a></p>
<p>Author: William Yang Wang ; Edward Lin ; John Kominek</p><p>Abstract: We propose a Laplacian structured sparsity model to study computational branding analytics. To do this, we collected customer reviews from Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, and other coffee shops across 38 major cities in the Midwest and Northeastern regions of USA. We study the brand related language use through these reviews, with focuses on the brand satisfaction and gender factors. In particular, we perform three tasks: automatic brand identification from raw text, joint brand-satisfaction prediction, and joint brandgender-satisfaction prediction. This work extends previous studies in text classification by incorporating the dependency and interaction among local features in the form of structured sparsity in a log-linear model. Our quantitative evaluation shows that our approach which combines the advantages of graphical modeling and sparsity modeling techniques significantly outperforms various standard and stateof-the-art text classification algorithms. In addition, qualitative analysis of our model reveals important features of the language uses associated with the specific brands.</p><p>4 0.32353076 <a title="202-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Identifying_Multiple_Userids_of_the_Same_Author.html">95 emnlp-2013-Identifying Multiple Userids of the Same Author</a></p>
<p>Author: Tieyun Qian ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of identifying users who use multiple userids to post in social media. Since multiple userids may belong to the same author, it is hard to directly apply supervised learning to solve the problem. This paper proposes a new method, which still uses supervised learning but does not require training documents from the involved userids. Instead, it uses documents from other userids for classifier building. The classifier can be applied to documents of the involved userids. This is possible because we transform the document space to a similarity space and learning is performed in this new space. Our evaluation is done in the online review domain. The experimental results using a large number of userids and their reviews show that the proposed method is highly effective. 1</p><p>5 0.29946837 <a title="202-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Domain_Knowledge_in_Aspect_Extraction.html">77 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Aspect Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiyuan Chen ; Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu ; Meichun Hsu ; Malu Castellanos ; Riddhiman Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical models have been used for the task. However, such models without any domain knowledge often produce aspects that are not interpretable in applications. To tackle the issue, some knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which allow the user to input some prior domain knowledge to generate coherent aspects. However, existing knowledge-based topic models have several major shortcomings, e.g., little work has been done to incorporate the cannot-link type of knowledge or to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that MCLDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models markedly.</p><p>6 0.28888065 <a title="202-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Improvements_to_the_Bayesian_Topic_N-Gram_Models.html">100 emnlp-2013-Improvements to the Bayesian Topic N-Gram Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Gyorgy Szarvas ; Robert Busa-Fekete ; Eyke Hullermeier</p><p>Abstract: The problem to replace a word with a synonym that fits well in its sentential context is known as the lexical substitution task. In this paper, we tackle this task as a supervised ranking problem. Given a dataset of target words, their sentential contexts and the potential substitutions for the target words, the goal is to train a model that accurately ranks the candidate substitutions based on their contextual fitness. As a key contribution, we customize and evaluate several learning-to-rank models to the lexical substitution task, including classification-based and regression-based approaches. On two datasets widely used for lexical substitution, our best models signifi- cantly advance the state-of-the-art.</p><p>5 0.45533392 <a title="202-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Personal_Profile_Summarization_with_Social_Networks.html">48 emnlp-2013-Collective Personal Profile Summarization with Social Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>6 0.45463312 <a title="202-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Opinion_Target_Extraction_in_Chinese_Microblogs.html">47 emnlp-2013-Collective Opinion Target Extraction in Chinese Microblogs</a></p>

<p>Author: Ruihong Huang ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: The goal of our research is to distinguish veterinary message board posts that describe a case involving a specific patient from posts that ask a general question. We create a text classifier that incorporates automatically generated attribute lists for veterinary patients to tackle this problem. Using a small amount of annotated data, we train an information extraction (IE) system to identify veterinary patient attributes. We then apply the IE system to a large collection of unannotated texts to produce a lexicon of veterinary patient attribute terms. Our experimental results show that using the learned attribute lists to encode patient information in the text classifier yields improved performance on this task.</p><p>3 0.1337706 <a title="156-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Language_and_Translation_Modeling_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">113 emnlp-2013-Joint Language and Translation Modeling with Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Auli ; Michel Galley ; Chris Quirk ; Geoffrey Zweig</p><p>Abstract: We present a joint language and translation model based on a recurrent neural network which predicts target words based on an unbounded history of both source and target words. The weaker independence assumptions of this model result in a vastly larger search space compared to related feedforward-based language or translation models. We tackle this issue with a new lattice rescoring algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically. Our joint model builds on a well known recurrent neural network language model (Mikolov, 2012) augmented by a layer of additional inputs from the source language. We show competitive accuracy compared to the traditional channel model features. Our best results improve the output of a system trained on WMT 2012 French-English data by up to 1.5 BLEU, and by 1.1BLEU on average across several test sets.</p><p>4 0.068417393 <a title="156-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Monolingual_Marginal_Matching_for_Translation_Model_Adaptation.html">135 emnlp-2013-Monolingual Marginal Matching for Translation Model Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ann Irvine ; Chris Quirk ; Hal Daume III</p><p>Abstract: When using a machine translation (MT) model trained on OLD-domain parallel data to translate NEW-domain text, one major challenge is the large number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and new-translation-sense words. We present a method to identify new translations of both known and unknown source language words that uses NEW-domain comparable document pairs. Starting with a joint distribution of source-target word pairs derived from the OLD-domain parallel corpus, our method recovers a new joint distribution that matches the marginal distributions of the NEW-domain comparable document pairs, while minimizing the divergence from the OLD-domain distribution. Adding learned translations to our French-English MT model results in gains of about 2 BLEU points over strong baselines.</p><p>5 0.067766093 <a title="156-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Max-Margin_Synchronous_Grammar_Induction_for_Machine_Translation.html">127 emnlp-2013-Max-Margin Synchronous Grammar Induction for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Traditional synchronous grammar induction estimates parameters by maximizing likelihood, which only has a loose relation to translation quality. Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>6 0.06482587 <a title="156-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Improving_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Word_Class_Models.html">104 emnlp-2013-Improving Statistical Machine Translation with Word Class Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Rui Wang ; Masao Utiyama ; Isao Goto ; Eiichro Sumita ; Hai Zhao ; Bao-Liang Lu</p><p>Abstract: Neural network language models, or continuous-space language models (CSLMs), have been shown to improve the performance of statistical machine translation (SMT) when they are used for reranking n-best translations. However, CSLMs have not been used in the first pass decoding of SMT, because using CSLMs in decoding takes a lot of time. In contrast, we propose a method for converting CSLMs into back-off n-gram language models (BNLMs) so that we can use converted CSLMs in decoding. We show that they outperform the original BNLMs and are comparable with the traditional use of CSLMs in reranking.</p><p>5 0.34411636 <a title="156-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Generative_Joint%2C_Additive%2C_Sequential_Model_of_Topics_and_Speech_Acts_in_Patient-Doctor_Communication.html">6 emnlp-2013-A Generative Joint, Additive, Sequential Model of Topics and Speech Acts in Patient-Doctor Communication</a></p>
<p>Author: Byron C. Wallace ; Thomas A Trikalinos ; M. Barton Laws ; Ira B.

Our model expresses both token emission and state transition probabilities as log-linear functions of separate components corresponding to topics and speech acts (and their interactions).

<p>Author: Gary Patterson ; Andrew Kehler</p><p>Abstract: We present a classification model that predicts the presence or omission of a lexical connective between two clauses, based upon linguistic features of the clauses and the type of discourse relation holding between them. The model is trained on a set of high frequency relations extracted from the Penn Discourse Treebank and achieves an accuracy of 86.6%. Analysis of the results reveals that the most informative features relate to the discourse dependencies between sequences of coherence relations in the text. We also present results of an experiment that provides insight into the nature and difficulty of the task.</p><p>2 0.97126406 <a title="156-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Using_Crowdsourcing_to_get_Representations_based_on_Regular_Expressions.html">196 emnlp-2013-Using Crowdsourcing to get Representations based on Regular Expressions</a></p>
<p>Author: Anders Sgaard ; Hector Martinez ; Jakob Elming ; Anders Johannsen</p><p>Abstract: Often the bottleneck in document classification is finding good representations that zoom in on the most important aspects of the documents. Most research uses n-gram representations, but relevant features often occur discontinuously, e.g., not. . . good in sentiment analysis. In this paper we present experiments getting experts to provide regular expressions, as well as crowdsourced annotation tasks from which regular expressions can be derived. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that these crowdsourced feature combinations outperform automatic feature combination methods, as well as expert features, by a very large margin and reduce error by 24-41% over n-gram representations.</p><p>3 0.96924353 <a title="156-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Predicting_the_Resolution_of_Referring_Expressions_from_User_Behavior.html">153 emnlp-2013-Predicting the Resolution of Referring Expressions from User Behavior</a></p>

Manning</p><p>Abstract: NLP models have many and sparse features, and regularization is key for balancing model overfitting versus underfitting. A recently repopularized form of regularization is to generate fake training data by repeatedly adding noise to real data. We reinterpret this noising as an explicit regularizer, and approximate it with a second-order formula that can be used during training without actually generating fake data. We show how to apply this method to structured prediction using multinomial logistic regression and linear-chain CRFs. We tackle the key challenge of developing a dynamic program to compute the gradient of the regularizer efficiently. The regularizer is a sum over inputs, so we can estimate it more accurately via a semi-supervised or transductive extension. Applied to text classification and NER, our method provides a > 1% absolute performance gain over use of standard L2 regularization.</p><p>6 0.93824625 <a title="156-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Growing_Multi-Domain_Glossaries_from_a_Few_Seeds_using_Probabilistic_Topic_Models.html">92 emnlp-2013-Growing Multi-Domain Glossaries from a Few Seeds using Probabilistic Topic Models</a></p>

</p><p>7 Our approach gives the same level of alignment accuracy as IBM Model 2. [sent-7, score-0.129]
</p><p>8 1 Introduction The IBM translation models (Brown et al. [sent-8, score-0.08]
</p><p>9 , 1993) have been tremendously important in statistical ma-  chine translation (SMT). [sent-9, score-0.11]
</p><p>10 The IBM models were the first generation of SMT systems; in recent work, they play a central role in deriving alignments used within many modern SMT approaches, for example phrase-based translation models (Koehn, 2008) and syntax-based translation systems (e. [sent-10, score-0.304]
</p><p>11 Since the original IBM paper, there has been a large amount of research exploring the original IBM models and modern variants (e. [sent-14, score-0.086]
</p><p>12 Excluding IBM Model 1, the IBM translation models, and practically all variants proposed in the literature, have relied on the optimization of likelihood functions or similar functions that are nonconvex. [sent-19, score-0.419]
</p><p>13 Unfortunately, non-convex objective functions have multiple local optima, and finding a global optimum of a non-convex function is typically a computationally intractible problem. [sent-20, score-0.329]
</p><p>14 Typi1574 cally, an EM algorithm is used, which often runs in a reasonable amount of time, but with no guarantees of finding a global optima (or for that matter, even a  ×  near-optimal solution). [sent-21, score-0.178]
</p><p>15 In this paper we make the following contributions: • We introduce a convex relaxation of IBM MWoed einl r2o. [sent-22, score-0.385]
</p><p>16 Aucte a very high level, tthioen nre olafxa ItBioMn is derived by replacing the product t(fj |ei) d(i |j) with a relaxation that is commonly u)se ×d idn( it|hje) wlinitehar a programming tli tser caotmurme (e. [sent-23, score-0.15]

</p><p>18 We describe experiments with the method on sWtaen ddaersdc alignment datasets, showing tthhoatd t ohen EG algorithm converges in only a few passes over the data, and that our method achieves ac-  curacies that are very similar to those of IBM Model 2. [sent-30, score-0.227]
</p><p>19 Framing the unsupervised learning of alignment models as a convex optimization problem, with guaranteed convergence to a global optimum, has several clear advantages. [sent-31, score-0.67]
</p><p>20 First, the method is easier to analyze, as the objective function is being truly maximized. [sent-32, score-0.2]
</p><p>21 Second, there is no need for initialization heuristics with the approach, given that the method will always converge to a global optimum. [sent-33, score-0.192]
</p><p>22 Finally, we expect that our convexitybased approach may facilitate the further development of more convex models. [sent-34, score-0.235]
</p><p>23 In view of these developments, the lack  of convex methods in translation alignment models has been noticeable, and we hope that our work will open up new directions and lead to further progress in this area. [sent-38, score-0.478]
</p><p>24 , 1993) introduced IBM Models 1 through 5, and optimization methods for these models based on the EM algorithm. [sent-48, score-0.188]

</p><p>28 (Och and Ney, 2003) give a systematic  comparison of several alignment models in the literature. [sent-56, score-0.129]
</p><p>29 , 2010) describes a method based on posterior regularization that incorporates additional constraints within the EM algorithm for estimation of IBM models. [sent-59, score-0.1]
</p><p>30 All of these approaches are unsupervised, in that they do not require labeled alignment data; however several authors have considered supervised models (e. [sent-60, score-0.129]
</p><p>31 The focus of the current paper is on unsupervised learning; the unsupervised variants described above all make use of non1575 convex objective functions during training, with the usual problems with multiple local maxima. [sent-66, score-0.474]
</p><p>32 3  The IBM Model 1and Model 2 Optimization Problems  In this section we give a brief review of IBM Models 1 and 2, and the optimization problems arising from  these models. [sent-67, score-0.188]
</p><p>33 The standard approach for optimization within these models is the EM algorithm. [sent-68, score-0.188]
</p><p>34 For each English word e ∈ E, we will assume thaFt D(e) ihs a dictionary specifying wthee sweitl lo fa possible French words that can be translations of e. [sent-89, score-0.051]
</p><p>35 In practice, D(e) can be  derived in various ways; in our experiments we simply define D(e) to include all French words f such that e and f are seen in a translation pair. [sent-91, score-0.08]
</p><p>36 Given these definitions, the IBM model 2 optimization problem is given in Figure 1. [sent-92, score-0.221]
</p><p>37 The parameters in this problem are t(f|e) and d(i|j) . [sent-93, score-0.079]
</p><p>38 The t(f|e) parameters are tlreamns alraeti to(nf parameters specifying t|ehe) probability of English word e being translated as French word f. [sent-94, score-0.143]
</p><p>39 The distortion parameters d(i|j) specify the probability odifs tthoret j’th pFarreanmchet ewrsord d( iin|j a sentence being aligned to the i’th English word. [sent-95, score-0.096]
</p><p>40 We use a variant of IBM Model 2 where the distortion variables are shared across all sentence lengths (similar variants have been used in (Liang et al. [sent-96, score-0.13]
</p><p>41 The objective function is then  the log-likelihood of the training data (see Eq. [sent-98, score-0.2]
</p><p>42 Xi=0  Crucially, while the constraints in the IBM Model 2 optimization problem are linear, the objective function in Eq. [sent-100, score-0.454]
</p><p>43 Therefore, optimization methods for IBM Model 2, in particular the EM algorithm, are typically only guaranteed to reach a local maximum of the objective function. [sent-102, score-0.386]
</p><p>44 For completeness, Figure 2 shows the optimization problem for IBM Model 1. [sent-103, score-0.221]
</p><p>45 In IBM Model 1 the distortion parameters d(i |j) are all fixed to be tthhee dunisiftoorrtmio ndis ptarriabmuteiotenr (i. [sent-104, score-0.096]

</p><p>48 We are not aware of any guarantees for this initialization heuristic, however. [sent-111, score-0.08]
</p><p>49 4  A Convex Relaxation of IBM Model 2  We now introduce a convex optimization problem, the I2CR (IBM 2 Convex Relaxation) problem. [sent-112, score-0.423]
</p><p>50 As its name suggests, this optimization problem is closely related to IBM Model 2, but is convex. [sent-113, score-0.221]
</p><p>51 Because of this it will be relatively easy to derive an optimization algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum. [sent-114, score-0.426]
</p><p>52 Our experiments show that the relaxation gives very similar performance to the original IBM 2 optimization problem, as described in the previous section. [sent-115, score-0.338]
</p><p>53 We first describe an optimization problem, I2CR-1, that illustrates the basic idea behind the convex relaxation. [sent-116, score-0.451]
</p><p>54 ××  1577  The objective function is  1nXnXmklogXlkq(i,j,k) Xk=1 Xj=1  Xi=0  which is similar to the objective function in Figure 1, d(i|j) has been replaced by q(i, j,k). [sent-124, score-0.4]
</p><p>55 13-15, we had the constraint  but where t(fj(k)|ei(k))  q(i,j, k) =  t(fj(k)|ei(k))  d(i|j) ,  (17)  then the I2CR-1 problem would clearly be identical to the IBM Model 2 optimization problem. [sent-127, score-0.26]
</p><p>56 We have used a standard relaxation of the non-linear constraint x = y z where x, y, z are all variables cino tnhster range [0, 1], namely x x x  ≤ ≤ ≥  ,,  y z y+z  −  1. [sent-128, score-0.184]
</p><p>57 These inequalites are a relaxation in the sense that  ×  any (x, y, z) triple that satisfies x = y z also satiasnfyies ( xth,yes,ez )c otrnipsltreati hnatst. [sent-129, score-0.15]
</p><p>58 This is because the task is to maximize the objective with respect to the q variables and the objective is strictly increasing as the q values increase—thus lower bounds on their values are redundant in the I2CR-1 problem. [sent-134, score-0.346]
</p><p>59 It is easily verified that the constraints in the I2CR-1 problem are linear, and that the objective function is convex. [sent-135, score-0.266]
</p><p>60 In Section 5 of this paper we describe an optimization method for the problem. [sent-136, score-0.216]
</p><p>61 Note that because the objective function is being maximized, and the objective increases monotonically as the q values increase, at the global optimum1 1More precisely, at any global optimum: the objective func-  tion may not be strictly convex, in which case there will be multiple global optima. [sent-137, score-0.641]
</p><p>62 The problem is identical to the I2CR-1 problem, but it also includes a term in the objective function that is identical to the IBM Model 1 objective. [sent-139, score-0.311]
</p><p>63 2 The I2CR-2 Problem Figure 4 shows the refined optimization problem, which we call I2CR-2. [sent-144, score-0.188]
</p><p>64 First, we modify the objective function to be  21nXk=n1jXm=k1log0Xi=lk0q(i,j k)  +  21nkX=n1jXm=k1log0Xi=lk0t(f(Lj(k) +|e 1i()k)  1578 Thus the objective function includes a second term that is identical to the objective function for IBM Model 1 (see Figure 2). [sent-146, score-0.639]
</p><p>65 In preliminary experiments with the I2CR-1 optimization problem, we found that the I2CR-1 objective was not sufficiently dependent on the t parameters: intuitively, if the d parameters achieve the min on many training examples, the values for the t variables become unimportant. [sent-147, score-0.424]
</p><p>66 The optimization methods we use are gradient-based methods (or more precisely, subgradient-based methods), and we have found them to be considerably more stable when the  values for gradients do not diverge to infinity. [sent-152, score-0.284]
</p><p>67 5  A Stochastic Exponentiated-Gradient Algorithm for Optimization  We now describe an algorithm for optimizing the I2CR-2 problem in Figure 4. [sent-154, score-0.1]
</p><p>68 The algorithm is closely related to stochastic gradient ascent, but with two modifications: •  •  First, because the t(f|e) and d(i|j) parametFeirrss ,ha bveec simplex cto(fns|et)rai anntsd (see Figure 1), we use exponentiated gradient (EG) updates. [sent-155, score-0.385]
</p><p>69 EG algorithms are gradient-based methods that maintain simplex constraints; see for example: (Kivinen and Warmuth, 1997; Beck and Teboulle, 2003; Collins et al. [sent-156, score-0.054]
</p><p>70 Second, the objective function in the I2CRS2 problem ies convex, e b fuut icst onont idniff theeren It2iaCbRle(the gradient may not exist at all points). [sent-158, score-0.309]
</p><p>71 For this reason we use subgradients in the place of gradients. [sent-159, score-0.15]
</p><p>72 In spite of the non-differentiability  of the objective function, subgradient methods still have strong convergence guarantees when combined with EG updates (e. [sent-160, score-0.36]
</p><p>73 To derive the updates, recall that we are maximizing the following objective function: h(t, d)  = +  2|1T |Xk∈TXjm=k1log0iX=lk0minnt(fj(k)|ei(k) ,d(i|j)o 2|1T |Xk∈TjXm=k1log0iX=lk0t(f(Lj(k +)|e 1i()k) . [sent-163, score-0.156]
</p><p>74 ; w Wee use t and d to refer to the full set of t and d parameters respectively; h(t, d) is the function to be maximized. [sent-171, score-0.09]

</p><p>76 Subgradients are spirmoidlaurc to gradients ftoorr sduifafenrdentiable concave functions, in that gradients satisfy the above property. [sent-174, score-0.163]
</p><p>77 Subgradients can be used in the place of gradients in many optimization algorithms (see for example (Bertsekas, 1999)). [sent-175, score-0.248]
</p><p>78 ,  2We set ∇t(f|e) and ∇d(i|j) objective efutn ∇cttio(fn| ein) Eq. [sent-181, score-0.156]

</p><p>80 Exponentiated-gradient updates then take the following form:  t(f|e) ←Ptf(ft(|fe)|e ×) × ex epx{pγ{γ × × ∇t ∇(ft(|ef)|e})}  (20)  and  d(i|j) ←Pdi(di|(ji)|j ×) × ex epx{pγ{γ × × ∇d ∇(di|(ji|)j})},  (21)  where γ > 0P Pis a constant step size in the algorithm. [sent-184, score-0.056]
</p><p>81 Note that the EG updates make use of subgradients, but maintain the simplex constraints on the t and d variables. [sent-185, score-0.143]
</p><p>82 The method just described is a batch gradient method, where the entire training set T = {1. [sent-186, score-0.123]

</p><p>84 Many results in machine learning and NLP have shown that stochastic gradient methods, where a subset of the training examples is used before each gradient-based update, can converge much more quickly than batch gradient methods. [sent-191, score-0.355]
</p><p>85 The algorithm then performs EG updates using each minibatch T1 . [sent-202, score-0.095]
</p><p>86 As can be seen in Table 3, our experiments show that the algorithm makes very significant progress in the first pass over the data, and takes very few iterations to converge to a good solution even though we initialized with uniform parameter values. [sent-206, score-0.224]
</p><p>87 6  Experiments  In this section we describe experiments using the I2CR-2 optimization problem combined with the  rithm for optimization of I2CR-2. [sent-207, score-0.437]
</p><p>88 1 Data Sets We use data from the bilingual word alignment workshop held at HLT-NAACL 2003 (Michalcea and Pederson, 2003). [sent-212, score-0.129]
</p><p>89 The development and test data have been manually aligned at the word level, annotating alignments between source and target words in the corpus as either “sure” (S) or “possible” (P) alignments, as described in (Och and Ney, 2003). [sent-215, score-0.104]
</p><p>90 For the EG algorithm we use a batch size B = 250 and step size γ = 0. [sent-220, score-0.086]
</p><p>91 If A is the set of alignments produced by an algorithm, S is the set of sure alignments as annotated in test data, and P is the  set of possible alignments, then these quantities are defined as  Recall =|A| ∩S| S|, Precision =|A| ∩A| S|, AER = 1 −|A ∩|A S|| + + | |AS| ∩ P|,  F-Measure =Re. [sent-224, score-0.208]
</p><p>92 Note that we report results in both AER and F-measure; however there is evidence (Fraser and Marcu, 2004) that F-measure is better correlated with translation quality when the alignments are used in a full system. [sent-227, score-0.184]
</p><p>93 For the EG algorithm, we use 10 iterations over the training data for the Hansards data, and 15 iterations on the Romanian-English data (on the latter dataset results  on the trial data showed that the method took slightly longer to converge). [sent-230, score-0.074]
</p><p>94 It can be seen that both I2CR-2 and IBM Model 2 converge to a fairly stable result after 2-3 iterations. [sent-233, score-0.114]
</p><p>95 On the right, Table 3 shows the values of the objective function at each iteration when using the EG algorithm to optimize the I2CR-2 objective. [sent-239, score-0.276]
</p><p>96 The method makes a large amount of progress on the first iteration and then continues to improve. [sent-240, score-0.071]
</p><p>97 Finally, we note that the memory requirements for I2CR-2 and IBM2 are about the same, but that the time for one iteration of I2CR-2 on the Hansards data is approximately one hour, while the time for one iteration of IBM2 was approximately 10 minutes. [sent-241, score-0.074]

<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Traditional synchronous grammar induction estimates parameters by maximizing likelihood, which only has a loose relation to translation quality. Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>4 0.099204078 <a title="2-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Improving_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Word_Class_Models.html">104 emnlp-2013-Improving Statistical Machine Translation with Word Class Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Tian Xia ; Zongcheng Ji ; Shaodan Zhai ; Yidong Chen ; Qun Liu ; Shaojun Wang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization framework which supports heterogeneous information sources to improve alignment in machine translation system combination techniques. In this area, most of techniques usually utilize confusion networks (CN) as their central data structure to compact an exponential number of an potential hypotheses, and because better hypothesis alignment may benefit constructing better quality confusion networks, it is natural to add more useful information to improve alignment results. However, these information may be heterogeneous, so the widely-used Viterbi algorithm for searching the best alignment may not apply here. In the multi-objective optimization framework, each information source is viewed as an independent objective, and a new goal of improving all objectives can be searched by mature algorithms. The solutions from this framework, termed Pareto optimal solutions, are then combined to construct confusion networks. Experiments on two Chinese-to-English translation datasets show significant improvements, 0.97 and 1.06 BLEU points over a strong Indirected Hidden Markov Model-based (IHMM) system, and 4.75 and 3.53 points over the best single machine translation systems.</p><p>3 0.62567472 <a title="2-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Unsupervised_Spectral_Learning_of_WCFG_as_Low-rank_Matrix_Completion.html">195 emnlp-2013-Unsupervised Spectral Learning of WCFG as Low-rank Matrix Completion</a></p>

<p>Author: Michel Galley ; Chris Quirk ; Colin Cherry ; Kristina Toutanova</p><p>Abstract: Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) remains one of the preferred methods for tuning linear parameters in machine translation systems, yet it faces significant issues. First, MERT is an unregularized learner and is therefore prone to overfitting. Second, it is commonly used on a noisy, non-convex loss function that becomes more difficult to optimize as the number of parameters increases. To address these issues, we study the addition of a regularization term to the MERT objective function. Since standard regularizers such as ‘2 are inapplicable to MERT due to the scale invariance of its objective function, we turn to two regularizers—‘0 and a modification of‘2— and present methods for efficiently integrating them during search. To improve search in large parameter spaces, we also present a new direction finding algorithm that uses the gradient of expected BLEU to orient MERT’s exact line searches. Experiments with up to 3600 features show that these extensions of MERT yield results comparable to PRO, a learner often used with large feature sets.</p><p>5 0.545636 <a title="2-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Breaking_Out_of_Local_Optima_with_Count_Transforms_and_Model_Recombination%3A_A_Study_in_Grammar_Induction.html">40 emnlp-2013-Breaking Out of Local Optima with Count Transforms and Model Recombination: A Study in Grammar Induction</a></p>

And whereas past work has focused on identifying individual fake reviews, this paper aims to identify offerings (e.g., hotels) that contain fake reviews. We introduce a semi-supervised manifold ranking algorithm for this task, which relies on a small set of labeled individual reviews for training. Then, in the absence of gold standard labels (at an offering level), we introduce a novel evaluation procedure that ranks artificial instances of real offerings, where each artificial offering contains a known number of injected deceptive reviews.

<p>Author: Margaret Mitchell ; Jacqui Aguilar ; Theresa Wilson ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to sentiment analysis for a low resource setting. The intuition behind this work is that sentiment expressed towards an entity, targeted sentiment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment expressed across the entity. This representation allows us to model sentiment detection as a sequence tagging problem, jointly discovering people and organizations along with whether there is sentiment directed towards them. We compare performance in both Spanish and English on microblog data, using only a sentiment lexicon as an external resource. By leveraging linguisticallyinformed features within conditional random fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empirical risk, our best models in Spanish significantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach around 90% accuracy on the combined task of named entity recognition and sentiment prediction. Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.</p><p>5 0.54111516 <a title="2-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Bilingual_Word_Embeddings_for_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation.html">38 emnlp-2013-Bilingual Word Embeddings for Phrase-Based Machine Translation</a></p>

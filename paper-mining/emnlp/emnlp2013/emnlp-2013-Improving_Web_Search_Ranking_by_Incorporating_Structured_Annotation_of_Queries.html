</p><p>3 In a structured annotation, the original query is split into different units that are associated with semantic attributes in the corresponding domain. [sent-4, score-0.683]
</p><p>4 We evaluate our techniques using real world queries and achieve significant improvement. [sent-5, score-0.256]
</p><p>5 1  Introduction  Search engines are getting more sophisticated by utilizing information from multiple diverse sources. [sent-7, score-0.019]
</p><p>6 One such valuable source of information is structured and semi-structured data, which is not very difficult to access, owing to information extraction (Wong et al. [sent-8, score-0.302]
</p><p>7 , 2008; Zhai and Liu 2006) and semantic web efforts. [sent-10, score-0.053]
</p><p>8 *Work was done when the first author Research Asia  was  visiting Microsoft 468  tliu } @ i . [sent-11, score-0.015]
</p><p>9 com Driving the web search evolution are the user needs. [sent-16, score-0.177]
</p><p>10 Users usually have a template in mind when formulating queries to search for information. [sent-17, score-0.474]
</p><p>11 , (2010) surveyed a search log of 15 million queries from a commercial search engine. [sent-19, score-0.519]
</p><p>12 They found that 90% of queries follow certain templates. [sent-20, score-0.256]
</p><p>13 For example, by issuing the query “taylor swift lyrics falling in love”, the users are actually seeking for the lyrics of the song “Mary's Song (oh my my my)” by artist Taylor Swift. [sent-21, score-2.311]
</p><p>14 The  words “falling in love” are actually part of the lyrics they are searching for. [sent-22, score-0.583]
</p><p>15 However, some top search results are irrelevant to the query, although they contain all the query terms. [sent-23, score-0.506]
</p><p>16 For example, the first top search result shown in Figure 1(a) does not contain the required lyrics. [sent-24, score-0.147]
</p><p>17 It just contains the lyrics of another song of Taylor Swift, rather than the song that users are seeking. [sent-25, score-0.737]
</p><p>18 A possible way to solve the above ranking problem is to understand the underlying query structure. [sent-26, score-0.404]
</p><p>19 For example, after recognizing that “taylor swift” is an artist name and “falling in love” are part of the lyrics, we can improve the ranking by comparing the structured query with the corresponding structured data in documents (shown in Figure 1(b)). [sent-27, score-1.106]
</p><p>20 Some previous studies investigated how to extract structured information from user queries, such as query segmentation (Bergsma and Wang, 2007). [sent-28, score-0.718]
</p><p>21 The task of query segmentation is to separate the query words into  11. [sent-29, score-0.813]
</p><p>22 08] [Growing up and falling in love…  …,  #lyrics, 0. [sent-43, score-0.213]
</p><p>23 Search  results  Query Structured Annotation Generation (d) of query  “taylor  swift  lyrics  falling  [I realize your love is the best …, #lyrics, 0. [sent-47, score-1.689]
</p><p>24 08] Weighted Annotated Tokens (c)  in love” and processing pipeline  disjointed segments so that each segment maps to a semantic unit (Li et al. [sent-48, score-0.151]
</p><p>25 For example, the segmentation of the query “taylor swift lyrics falling in love” can be “taylor swift | lyrics | falling in love”. [sent-50, score-2.727]
</p><p>26 , 2009) proposed the task of structured annotation of queries which aims to detect the structure of the query and assign a specific label to it. [sent-54, score-1.104]
</p><p>27 However, to our knowledge, the previous methods do not exploit an effective approach for improving web search ranking by incorporating structured annotation of queries. [sent-55, score-0.653]
</p><p>28 In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using structured annotation of queries to improve web search ranking. [sent-56, score-0.845]
</p><p>29 Specifically, we propose a greedy algorithm which uses the structured data  (named annotated tokens in Figure 1(b)) extracted from the top search results to annotate the latent structured semantics in web queries. [sent-57, score-0.86]
</p><p>30 We then compute matching scores between the annotated query and the corresponding structured information contained in documents. [sent-58, score-0.695]
</p><p>31 The top search results can be re-ranked according to the matching scores. [sent-59, score-0.167]
</p><p>32 However, it is very difficult to extract structured data from all of the search results. [sent-60, score-0.394]
</p><p>33 469 Hence, we propose a relevance feedback based reranking model. [sent-61, score-0.061]
</p><p>34 We use these structured documents whose matching scores are greater than a threshold as feedback documents, to effectively re-rank other search results to bring more relevant and novel information to the user. [sent-62, score-0.463]
</p><p>35 Experiments on a large web search dataset from a major commercial search engine show that the FMeasure of structured annotation generated by our approach is as high as 91%. [sent-63, score-0.744]
</p><p>36 On this dataset, our reranking model using the structured annotations significantly outperforms two baselines. [sent-64, score-0.309]
</p><p>37 We propose a novel approach to generate structured annotation of queries based on top  search results. [sent-66, score-0.862]
</p><p>38 Although structured annotation of queries has been studied previously, to the best of our knowledge this is the first paper that attempts to improve web search ranking by incorporating structured annotation of queries. [sent-68, score-1.353]
</p><p>39 Section 3 presents our method for generating structured annotation of queries. [sent-71, score-0.442]
</p><p>40 We then propose two novel re-ranking models based on structured annotation in Section 4. [sent-72, score-0.459]
</p><p>41 2  Related Work  There is a great deal of prior research that identifies query structured information. [sent-76, score-0.659]
</p><p>42 1  Structured Annotation of Queries  Recently, a lot of work has been done on understanding query structure (Sarkas et al. [sent-79, score-0.378]
</p><p>43 One important method is structured annotation of queries which aims to detect the structure of the query and assign a specific label to it. [sent-83, score-1.104]
</p><p>44 , (2009) proposed web query tagging and its goal is to assign to each query term a specified category, roughly corresponding to a list of attributes. [sent-85, score-0.796]
</p><p>45 A semi-supervised Conditional Random Field (CRF) is used to capture dependencies between query words and to identify the most likely joint assignment of words to “categories. [sent-86, score-0.359]
</p><p>46 First, we generate structured annotation of queries based on top search results, not some global knowledge base or query logs. [sent-88, score-1.189]
</p><p>47 Second, they mainly focus on the method of generating structured annotation of queries, rather than leverage the generated query structures to improve web search rankings. [sent-89, score-0.985]
</p><p>48 In this paper, we not only offer a novel solution for generating structured annotation of queries, but also propose a re-ranking approach to improve Web search based on structured annotation of queries. [sent-90, score-1.01]
</p><p>49 , (201 1) also used top search results to generate structured annotation of queries. [sent-92, score-0.574]
</p><p>50 However, the annotations in their  definition are capitalization, POS tags, and segmentation indicators, which are different from ours. [sent-93, score-0.137]
</p><p>51 2 Query Template Generation The concept of query template has been discussed in a few recent papers (Agarwal et al. [sent-95, score-0.447]
</p><p>52 A query template is a sequence of terms, where each term could be a word or an attribute. [sent-99, score-0.447]
</p><p>53 For example, <#artist_name lyrics #lyrics> is a query template, “#artist_name” and “#lyrics” are attributes, and “lyrics” is a word. [sent-100, score-0.942]
</p><p>54 Structured annotation of queries is different from query template, as a query template can instantiate multiple queries while a 470 Table 1. [sent-101, score-1.497]
</p><p>55 We aim to automatically annotate query structure based on top search results, and further use these structured annotations to re-rank top search results for improving search performance. [sent-104, score-1.079]
</p><p>56 3 Query Segmentation The task of query segmentation is to separate the query words into disjointed segments so that each segment maps to a semantic unit (Li et al. [sent-106, score-0.964]
</p><p>57 Query segmentation techniques have been well studied in recent literature (Tan and Peng, 2008; Yu and Shi, 2009). [sent-108, score-0.095]
</p><p>58 However, structured annotation of queries cannot only separate the query words into disjoint segments but can also assign each segment a semantic label which can help the search engine to judge whether each part of query segmentation matches the right field of the documents or not. [sent-109, score-1.837]
</p><p>59 4 Entity Search The problem of entity search has received a great deal of attention in recent years (Guo et al. [sent-111, score-0.181]
</p><p>60 The problem of structured annotation of queries is related to entity search because for some queries, structured annotation items are entities or attributes. [sent-116, score-1.257]
</p><p>61 Some existing entity search approaches also exploit knowledge from the structure of webpages (Zhao et al. [sent-117, score-0.19]
</p><p>62 Annotating query structured information differs from entity search in the following aspects. [sent-119, score-0.772]
</p><p>63 First, structured annotation based ranking is applicable for all queries, rather than just entity related queries. [sent-120, score-0.51]
</p><p>64 A token is defined as a sequence of words including space, i. [sent-124, score-0.081]
</p><p>65 As our objective is to find structured annotation of queries in a specific domain, we begin with a definition of domain schema. [sent-128, score-0.803]
</p><p>66 Definition 1 (Domain Schema): For a given domain of interest, the domain schema is the set of attributes. [sent-129, score-0.21]
</p><p>67 , 2010), our definition of domain schema does not need attribute values. [sent-140, score-0.231]
</p><p>68 For the sake of simplicity, this paper assumes that attributes in domain schema are available. [sent-141, score-0.207]
</p><p>69 However, it is not difficult to pre-specify attributes in a specific domain. [sent-142, score-0.096]
</p><p>70 Definition 2 (Annotated Token): An annotated token in a specific domain is a pair [? [sent-143, score-0.211]
</p><p>71 ], where v is a token and a is a corresponding attribute for v in this domain. [sent-145, score-0.123]
</p><p>72 [hey jude, #song_name] is an example of an annotated token for the “lyrics” domain shown in Table 1. [sent-146, score-0.192]
</p><p>73 The words “hey jude” comprise a token, and its corresponding attribute name is #song_name. [sent-147, score-0.074]
</p><p>74 If a token does not have any corresponding attributes, we denote it as free token. [sent-148, score-0.115]
</p><p>75 Definition 3 (Structured Annotation): A structured annotation p is a sequence of terms < ? [sent-149, score-0.427]
</p><p>76 could be a free token or an annotated token, and at least one of the terms is an annotated token, i. [sent-155, score-0.215]
</p><p>77 Given the schema for the domain “lyrics”, <[taylor swift, #artist_name] lyrics [falling in love, #lyrics]> is a possible structured annotation for the query “taylor swift lyrics falling in love”. [sent-162, score-2.663]
</p><p>78 In this annotation, [taylor swift, #artist_name] and [falling in love, #lyrics] are two annotated tokens. [sent-163, score-0.05]
</p><p>79 Intuitively, a structured annotation corresponds to an interpretation of the query as a request for some structured information from documents. [sent-165, score-1.069]
</p><p>80 The set of annotated tokens expresses the information need of the documents that have been requested. [sent-166, score-0.111]
</p><p>81 The free tokens may provide more diverse 471 Algorithm 1: Query Structured Annotation Generation Input: a list of weighted annotated tokens T = {t1, … , tm} ; a query q = “w1, , wn” where wi ∈ W; a pre-defined threshold score ? [sent-167, score-0.522]

<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan</p><p>Abstract: Web search users frequently modify their queries in hope of receiving better results. This process is referred to as “Query Reformulation”. Previous research has mainly focused on proposing query reformulations in the form of suggested queries for users. Some research has studied the problem of predicting whether the current query is a reformulation of the previous query or not. However, this work has been limited to bag-of-words models where the main signals being used are word overlap, character level edit distance and word level edit distance. In this work, we show that relying solely on surface level text similarity results in many false positives where queries with different intents yet similar topics are mistakenly predicted as query reformulations. We propose a new representation for Web search queries based on identifying the concepts in queries and show that we can sig- nificantly improve query reformulation performance using features of query concepts.</p><p>3 0.16287218 <a title="105-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_to_Freestyle%3A_Hip_Hop_Challenge-Response_Induction_via_Transduction_Rule_Segmentation.html">122 emnlp-2013-Learning to Freestyle: Hip Hop Challenge-Response Induction via Transduction Rule Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dekai Wu ; Karteek Addanki ; Markus Saers ; Meriem Beloucif</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel model, Freestyle, that learns to improvise rhyming and fluent responses upon being challenged with a line of hip hop lyrics, by combining both bottomup token based rule induction and top-down rule segmentation strategies to learn a stochastic transduction grammar that simultaneously learns bothphrasing and rhyming associations. In this attack on the woefully under-explored natural language genre of music lyrics, we exploit a strictly unsupervised transduction grammar induction approach. Our task is particularly ambitious in that no use of any a priori linguistic or phonetic information is allowed, even though the domain of hip hop lyrics is particularly noisy and unstructured. We evaluate the performance of the learned model against a model learned only using the more conventional bottom-up token based rule induction, and demonstrate the superiority of our combined token based and rule segmentation induction method toward generating higher quality improvised responses, measured on fluency and rhyming criteria as judged by human evaluators. To highlight some of the inherent challenges in adapting other algorithms to this novel task, we also compare the quality ofthe responses generated by our model to those generated by an out-ofthe-box phrase based SMT system. We tackle the challenge of selecting appropriate training data for our task via a dedicated rhyme scheme detection module, which is also acquired via unsupervised learning and report improved quality of the generated responses. Finally, we report results with Maghrebi French hip hop lyrics indicating that our model performs surprisingly well with no special adaptation to other languages. 102</p><p>4 0.11351606 <a title="105-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Boosting_Cross-Language_Retrieval_by_Learning_Bilingual_Phrase_Associations_from_Relevance_Rankings.html">39 emnlp-2013-Boosting Cross-Language Retrieval by Learning Bilingual Phrase Associations from Relevance Rankings</a></p>
<p>Author: Artem Sokokov ; Laura Jehl ; Felix Hieber ; Stefan Riezler</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to learning bilingual n-gram correspondences from relevance rankings of English documents for Japanese queries. We show that directly optimizing cross-lingual rankings rivals and complements machine translation-based cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). We propose an efficient boosting algorithm that deals with very large cross-product spaces of word correspondences. We show in an experimental evaluation on patent prior art search that our approach, and in particular a consensus-based combination of boosting and translation-based approaches, yields substantial improvements in CLIR performance. Our training and test data are made publicly available.</p><p>5 0.09148483 <a title="105-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Simulating_Early-Termination_Search_for_Verbose_Spoken_Queries.html">173 emnlp-2013-Simulating Early-Termination Search for Verbose Spoken Queries</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiao Ding ; Zhicheng Dou ; Bing Qin ; Ting Liu ; Ji-rong Wen</p><p>Abstract: Web users are increasingly looking for structured data, such as lyrics, job, or recipes, using unstructured queries on the web. However, retrieving relevant results from such data is a challenging problem due to the unstructured language of the web queries. In this paper, we propose a method to improve web search ranking by detecting Structured Annotation of queries based on top search results. In a structured annotation, the original query is split into different units that are associated with semantic attributes in the corresponding domain. We evaluate our techniques using real world queries and achieve significant improvement. . 1</p><p>2 0.88140029 <a title="105-lsi-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Identifying_Web_Search_Query_Reformulation_using_Concept_based_Matching.html">97 emnlp-2013-Identifying Web Search Query Reformulation using Concept based Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan</p><p>Abstract: Web search users frequently modify their queries in hope of receiving better results. This process is referred to as “Query Reformulation”. Previous research has mainly focused on proposing query reformulations in the form of suggested queries for users. Some research has studied the problem of predicting whether the current query is a reformulation of the previous query or not. However, this work has been limited to bag-of-words models where the main signals being used are word overlap, character level edit distance and word level edit distance. In this work, we show that relying solely on surface level text similarity results in many false positives where queries with different intents yet similar topics are mistakenly predicted as query reformulations. We propose a new representation for Web search queries based on identifying the concepts in queries and show that we can sig- nificantly improve query reformulation performance using features of query concepts.</p><p>3 0.56297624 <a title="105-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Simulating_Early-Termination_Search_for_Verbose_Spoken_Queries.html">173 emnlp-2013-Simulating Early-Termination Search for Verbose Spoken Queries</a></p>
<p>Author: Jerome White ; Douglas W. Oard ; Nitendra Rajput ; Marion Zalk</p><p>Abstract: Building search engines that can respond to spoken queries with spoken content requires that the system not just be able to find useful responses, but also that it know when it has heard enough about what the user wants to be able to do so. This paper describes a simulation study with queries spoken by non-native speakers that suggests that indicates that finding relevant content is often possible within a half minute, and that combining features based on automatically recognized words with features designed for automated prediction of query difficulty can serve as a useful basis for predicting when that useful content has been found.</p><p>4 0.53139544 <a title="105-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Open-Domain_Fine-Grained_Class_Extraction_from_Web_Search_Queries.html">142 emnlp-2013-Open-Domain Fine-Grained Class Extraction from Web Search Queries</a></p>

<p>Author: Artem Sokokov ; Laura Jehl ; Felix Hieber ; Stefan Riezler</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to learning bilingual n-gram correspondences from relevance rankings of English documents for Japanese queries. We show that directly optimizing cross-lingual rankings rivals and complements machine translation-based cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). We propose an efficient boosting algorithm that deals with very large cross-product spaces of word correspondences. We show in an experimental evaluation on patent prior art search that our approach, and in particular a consensus-based combination of boosting and translation-based approaches, yields substantial improvements in CLIR performance. Our training and test data are made publicly available.</p><p>6 0.46267283 <a title="105-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_to_Freestyle%3A_Hip_Hop_Challenge-Response_Induction_via_Transduction_Rule_Segmentation.html">122 emnlp-2013-Learning to Freestyle: Hip Hop Challenge-Response Induction via Transduction Rule Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jinpeng Wang ; Wayne Xin Zhao ; Haitian Wei ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Hot trends are likely to bring new business opportunities. For example, “Air Pollution” might lead to a significant increase of the sales of related products, e.g., mouth mask. For ecommerce companies, it is very important to make rapid and correct response to these hot trends in order to improve product sales. In this paper, we take the initiative to study the task of how to identify trend related products. The major novelty of our work is that we automatically learn commercial intents revealed from microblogs. We carefully construct a data collection for this task and present quite a few insightful findings. In order to solve this problem, we further propose a graph based method, which jointly models relevance and associativity. We perform extensive experiments and the results showed that our methods are very effective.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7613008 <a title="105-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Improving_Web_Search_Ranking_by_Incorporating_Structured_Annotation_of_Queries.html">105 emnlp-2013-Improving Web Search Ranking by Incorporating Structured Annotation of Queries</a></p>

<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Classical coreference systems encode various syntactic, discourse, and semantic phenomena explicitly, using heterogenous features computed from hand-crafted heuristics. In contrast, we present a state-of-the-art coreference system that captures such phenomena implicitly, with a small number of homogeneous feature templates examining shallow properties of mentions. Surprisingly, our features are actually more effective than the corresponding hand-engineered ones at modeling these key linguistic phenomena, allowing us to win “easy victories” without crafted heuristics. These features are successful on syntax and discourse; however, they do not model semantic compatibility well, nor do we see gains from experiments with shallow semantic features from the literature, suggesting that this approach to semantics is an “uphill battle.” Nonetheless, our final system1 outperforms the Stanford system (Lee et al. (201 1), the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task) by 3.5% absolute on the CoNLL metric and outperforms the IMS system (Bj o¨rkelund and Farkas (2012), the best publicly available English coreference system) by 1.9% absolute.</p><p>4 0.58067727 <a title="105-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Zero_Pronouns_to_Improve_Chinese_Coreference_Resolution.html">80 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Zero Pronouns to Improve Chinese Coreference Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Fang Kong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Coreference resolution plays a critical role in discourse analysis. This paper focuses on exploiting zero pronouns to improve Chinese coreference resolution. In particular, a simplified semantic role labeling framework is proposed to identify clauses and to detect zero pronouns effectively, and two effective methods (refining syntactic parser and refining learning example generation) are employed to exploit zero pronouns for Chinese coreference resolution. Evaluation on the CoNLL-2012 shared task data set shows that zero pronouns can significantly improve Chinese coreference resolution.</p><p>5 0.57437325 <a title="105-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Error-Driven_Analysis_of_Challenges_in_Coreference_Resolution.html">73 emnlp-2013-Error-Driven Analysis of Challenges in Coreference Resolution</a></p>

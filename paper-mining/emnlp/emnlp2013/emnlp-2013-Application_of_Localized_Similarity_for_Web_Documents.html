<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Bowen Zhou ; Bing Xiang</p><p>Abstract: Reordering poses one of the greatest challenges in Statistical Machine Translation research as the key contextual information may well be beyond the confine oftranslation units. We present the “Anchor Graph” (AG) model where we use a graph structure to model global contextual information that is crucial for reordering. The key ingredient of our AG model is the edges that capture the relationship between the reordering around a set of selected translation units, which we refer to as anchors. As the edges link anchors that may span multiple translation units at decoding time, our AG model effectively encodes global contextual information that is previously absent. We integrate our proposed model into a state-of-the-art translation system and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal in a largescale Chinese-to-English translation task.</p><p>3 0.23848943 <a title="24-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Modeling_Scientific_Impact_with_Topical_Influence_Regression.html">133 emnlp-2013-Modeling Scientific Impact with Topical Influence Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: James Foulds ; Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: When reviewing scientific literature, it would be useful to have automatic tools that identify the most influential scientific articles as well as how ideas propagate between articles. In this context, this paper introduces topical influence, a quantitative measure of the extent to which an article tends to spread its topics to the articles that cite it. Given the text of the articles and their citation graph, we show how to learn a probabilistic model to recover both the degree of topical influence of each article and the influence relationships between articles. Experimental results on corpora from two well-known computer science conferences are used to illustrate and validate the proposed approach.</p><p>4 0.14325769 <a title="24-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Orthonormal_Explicit_Topic_Analysis_for_Cross-Lingual_Document_Matching.html">148 emnlp-2013-Orthonormal Explicit Topic Analysis for Cross-Lingual Document Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: John Philip McCrae ; Philipp Cimiano ; Roman Klinger</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modelling has applications in machine translation, word sense disambiguation and terminology alignment. Multilingual extensions of approaches based on latent (LSI), generative (LDA, PLSI) as well as explicit (ESA) topic modelling can induce an interlingual topic space allowing documents in different languages to be mapped into the same space and thus to be compared across languages. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines latent and explicit topic modelling approaches in the sense that it builds on a set of explicitly defined topics, but then computes latent relations between these. Thus, the method combines the benefits of both explicit and latent topic modelling approaches. We show that on a crosslingual mate retrieval task, our model significantly outperforms LDA, LSI, and ESA, as well as a baseline that translates every word in a document into the target language.</p><p>5 0.13174461 <a title="24-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Collective_Entity_Linking_with_Stacking.html">69 emnlp-2013-Efficient Collective Entity Linking with Stacking</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengyan He ; Shujie Liu ; Yang Song ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Houfeng Wang</p><p>Abstract: Entity disambiguation works by linking ambiguous mentions in text to their corresponding real-world entities in knowledge base. Recent collective disambiguation methods enforce coherence among contextual decisions at the cost of non-trivial inference processes. We propose a fast collective disambiguation approach based on stacking. First, we train a local predictor g0 with learning to rank as base learner, to generate initial ranking list of candidates. Second, top k candidates of related instances are searched for constructing expressive global coherence features. A global predictor g1 is trained in the augmented feature space and stacking is employed to tackle the train/test mismatch problem. The proposed method is fast and easy to implement. Experiments show its effectiveness over various algorithms on several public datasets. By learning a rich semantic relatedness measure be- . tween entity categories and context document, performance is further improved.</p><p>6 0.11566722 <a title="24-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Relational_Inference_for_Wikification.html">160 emnlp-2013-Relational Inference for Wikification</a></p>

<p>Author: Moshe Koppel ; Shachar Seidman</p><p>Abstract: The identification of pseudepigraphic texts texts not written by the authors to which they are attributed – has important historical, forensic and commercial applications. We introduce an unsupervised technique for identifying pseudepigrapha. The idea is to identify textual outliers in a corpus based on the pairwise similarities of all documents in the corpus. The crucial point is that document similarity not be measured in any of the standard ways but rather be based on the output of a recently introduced algorithm for authorship verification. The proposed method strongly outperforms existing techniques in systematic experiments on a blog corpus. 1</p><p>5 0.48762259 <a title="24-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Anchor_Graph%3A_Global_Reordering_Contexts_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">22 emnlp-2013-Anchor Graph: Global Reordering Contexts for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Hao Zhang ; Liang Huang ; Kai Zhao ; Ryan McDonald</p><p>Abstract: Online learning algorithms like the perceptron are widely used for structured prediction tasks. For sequential search problems, like left-to-right tagging and parsing, beam search has been successfully combined with perceptron variants that accommodate search errors (Collins and Roark, 2004; Huang et al., 2012). However, perceptron training with inexact search is less studied for bottom-up parsing and, more generally, inference over hypergraphs. In this paper, we generalize the violation-fixing perceptron of Huang et al. (2012) to hypergraphs and apply it to the cube-pruning parser of Zhang and McDonald (2012). This results in the highest reported scores on WSJ evaluation set (UAS 93.50% and LAS 92.41% respectively) without the aid of additional resources.</p><p>2 0.80522883 <a title="24-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Distributions_over_Logical_Forms_for_Referring_Expression_Generation.html">119 emnlp-2013-Learning Distributions over Logical Forms for Referring Expression Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas FitzGerald ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to referring expression generation, casting it as a density estimation problem where the goal is to learn distributions over logical expressions identifying sets of objects in the world. Despite an extremely large space of possible expressions, we demonstrate effective learning of a globally normalized log-linear distribution. This learning is enabled by a new, multi-stage approximate inference technique that uses a pruning model to construct only the most likely logical forms. We train and evaluate the approach on a new corpus of references to sets of visual objects. Experiments show the approach is able to learn accurate models, which generate over 87% of the expressions people used. Additionally, on the previously studied special case of single object reference, we show a 35% relative error reduction over previous state of the art.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.75270146 <a title="24-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Application_of_Localized_Similarity_for_Web_Documents.html">24 emnlp-2013-Application of Localized Similarity for Web Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexander Rush ; Yin-Wen Chang ; Michael Collins</p><p>Abstract: Beam search is a fast and empirically effective method for translation decoding, but it lacks formal guarantees about search error. We develop a new decoding algorithm that combines the speed of beam search with the optimal certificate property of Lagrangian relaxation, and apply it to phrase- and syntax-based translation decoding. The new method is efficient, utilizes standard MT algorithms, and returns an exact solution on the majority of translation examples in our test data. The algorithm is 3.5 times faster than an optimized incremental constraint-based decoder for phrase-based translation and 4 times faster for syntax-based translation.</p><p>5 0.57648802 <a title="24-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Towards_Situated_Dialogue%3A_Revisiting_Referring_Expression_Generation.html">185 emnlp-2013-Towards Situated Dialogue: Revisiting Referring Expression Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Fang ; Changsong Liu ; Lanbo She ; Joyce Y. Chai</p><p>Abstract: In situated dialogue, humans and agents have mismatched capabilities of perceiving the shared environment. Their representations of the shared world are misaligned. Thus referring expression generation (REG) will need to take this discrepancy into consideration. To address this issue, we developed a hypergraph-based approach to account for group-based spatial relations and uncertainties in perceiving the environment. Our empirical results have shown that this approach outperforms a previous graph-based approach with an absolute gain of 9%. However, while these graph-based approaches perform effectively when the agent has perfect knowledge or perception of the environment (e.g., 84%), they perform rather poorly when the agent has imperfect perception of the environment (e.g., 45%). This big performance gap calls for new solutions to REG that can mediate a shared perceptual basis in situated dialogue.</p><p>6 0.55549431 <a title="24-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Dynamic_Feature_Selection_for_Dependency_Parsing.html">66 emnlp-2013-Dynamic Feature Selection for Dependency Parsing</a></p>

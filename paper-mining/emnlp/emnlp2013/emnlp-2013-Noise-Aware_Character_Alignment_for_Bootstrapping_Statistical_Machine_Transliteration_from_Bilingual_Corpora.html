<p>Author: Sida Wang ; Mengqiu Wang ; Stefan Wager ; Percy Liang ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: NLP models have many and sparse features, and regularization is key for balancing model overfitting versus underfitting. A recently repopularized form of regularization is to generate fake training data by repeatedly adding noise to real data. We reinterpret this noising as an explicit regularizer, and approximate it with a second-order formula that can be used during training without actually generating fake data. We show how to apply this method to structured prediction using multinomial logistic regression and linear-chain CRFs. We tackle the key challenge of developing a dynamic program to compute the gradient of the regularizer efficiently. The regularizer is a sum over inputs, so we can estimate it more accurately via a semi-supervised or transductive extension. Applied to text classification and NER, our method provides a > 1% absolute performance gain over use of standard L2 regularization.</p><p>4 0.10643543 <a title="139-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Boosting_Cross-Language_Retrieval_by_Learning_Bilingual_Phrase_Associations_from_Relevance_Rankings.html">39 emnlp-2013-Boosting Cross-Language Retrieval by Learning Bilingual Phrase Associations from Relevance Rankings</a></p>
<p>Author: Artem Sokokov ; Laura Jehl ; Felix Hieber ; Stefan Riezler</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to learning bilingual n-gram correspondences from relevance rankings of English documents for Japanese queries. We show that directly optimizing cross-lingual rankings rivals and complements machine translation-based cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). We propose an efficient boosting algorithm that deals with very large cross-product spaces of word correspondences. We show in an experimental evaluation on patent prior art search that our approach, and in particular a consensus-based combination of boosting and translation-based approaches, yields substantial improvements in CLIR performance. Our training and test data are made publicly available.</p><p>5 0.086294115 <a title="139-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Paraphrasing_4_Microblog_Normalization.html">151 emnlp-2013-Paraphrasing 4 Microblog Normalization</a></p>
<p>Author: Wang Ling ; Chris Dyer ; Alan W Black ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: Compared to the edited genres that have played a central role in NLP research, microblog texts use a more informal register with nonstandard lexical items, abbreviations, and free orthographic variation. When confronted with such input, conventional text analysis tools often perform poorly. Normalization replacing orthographically or lexically idiosyncratic forms with more standard variants can improve performance. We propose a method for learning normalization rules from machine translations of a parallel corpus of microblog messages. To validate the utility of our approach, we evaluate extrinsically, showing that normalizing English tweets and then translating improves translation quality (compared to translating unnormalized text) using three standard web translation services as well as a phrase-based translation system trained — — on parallel microblog data.</p><p>6 0.08410842 <a title="139-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Improving_Alignment_of_System_Combination_by_Using_Multi-objective_Optimization.html">101 emnlp-2013-Improving Alignment of System Combination by Using Multi-objective Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Tian Xia ; Zongcheng Ji ; Shaodan Zhai ; Yidong Chen ; Qun Liu ; Shaojun Wang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization framework which supports heterogeneous information sources to improve alignment in machine translation system combination techniques. In this area, most of techniques usually utilize confusion networks (CN) as their central data structure to compact an exponential number of an potential hypotheses, and because better hypothesis alignment may benefit constructing better quality confusion networks, it is natural to add more useful information to improve alignment results. However, these information may be heterogeneous, so the widely-used Viterbi algorithm for searching the best alignment may not apply here. In the multi-objective optimization framework, each information source is viewed as an independent objective, and a new goal of improving all objectives can be searched by mature algorithms. The solutions from this framework, termed Pareto optimal solutions, are then combined to construct confusion networks. Experiments on two Chinese-to-English translation datasets show significant improvements, 0.97 and 1.06 BLEU points over a strong Indirected Hidden Markov Model-based (IHMM) system, and 4.75 and 3.53 points over the best single machine translation systems.</p><p>4 0.54763192 <a title="139-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Feature_Noising_for_Log-Linear_Structured_Prediction.html">86 emnlp-2013-Feature Noising for Log-Linear Structured Prediction</a></p>

<p>Author: Joshua K. Hartshorne ; Claire Bonial ; Martha Palmer</p><p>Abstract: This research describes efforts to use crowdsourcing to improve the validity of the semantic predicates in VerbNet, a lexicon of about 6300 English verbs. The current semantic predicates can be thought of semantic primitives, into which the concepts denoted by a verb can be decomposed. For example, the verb spray (of the Spray class), involves the predicates MOTION, NOT, and LOCATION, where the event can be decomposed into an AGENT causing a THEME that was originally not in a particular location to now be in that location. Although VerbNet’s predicates are theoretically well-motivated, systematic empirical data is scarce. This paper describes a recently-launched attempt to address this issue with a series of human judgment tasks, posed to subjects in the form of games.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.71603769 <a title="139-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Noise-Aware_Character_Alignment_for_Bootstrapping_Statistical_Machine_Transliteration_from_Bilingual_Corpora.html">139 emnlp-2013-Noise-Aware Character Alignment for Bootstrapping Statistical Machine Transliteration from Bilingual Corpora</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>4 0.54660487 <a title="139-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Topics_and_Positions_from_Debatepedia.html">121 emnlp-2013-Learning Topics and Positions from Debatepedia</a></p>

We evaluate the resulting representation’s usefulness in attaching opinionated documents to arguments and its consistency with human judgments about positions.</p><p>5 0.54244936 <a title="139-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Deep_Models_for_Semantic_Compositionality_Over_a_Sentiment_Treebank.html">158 emnlp-2013-Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Alex Perelygin ; Jean Wu ; Jason Chuang ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Semantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning of longer phrases in a principled way. Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.</p><p>6 0.54061884 <a title="139-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Open_Domain_Targeted_Sentiment.html">143 emnlp-2013-Open Domain Targeted Sentiment</a></p>

<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Classical coreference systems encode various syntactic, discourse, and semantic phenomena explicitly, using heterogenous features computed from hand-crafted heuristics. In contrast, we present a state-of-the-art coreference system that captures such phenomena implicitly, with a small number of homogeneous feature templates examining shallow properties of mentions. Surprisingly, our features are actually more effective than the corresponding hand-engineered ones at modeling these key linguistic phenomena, allowing us to win “easy victories” without crafted heuristics. These features are successful on syntax and discourse; however, they do not model semantic compatibility well, nor do we see gains from experiments with shallow semantic features from the literature, suggesting that this approach to semantics is an “uphill battle.” Nonetheless, our final system1 outperforms the Stanford system (Lee et al. (201 1), the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task) by 3.5% absolute on the CoNLL metric and outperforms the IMS system (Bj o¨rkelund and Farkas (2012), the best publicly available English coreference system) by 1.9% absolute.</p><p>3 0.31301183 <a title="112-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Error-Driven_Analysis_of_Challenges_in_Coreference_Resolution.html">73 emnlp-2013-Error-Driven Analysis of Challenges in Coreference Resolution</a></p>

In this paper, we describe the Latent Left Linking model (L3M), a novel, principled, and linguistically motivated latent structured prediction approach to coreference resolution. We show that L3M admits efficient inference and can be augmented with knowledge-based constraints; we also present a fast stochastic gradient based learning.

This paper focuses on exploiting zero pronouns to improve Chinese coreference resolution. In particular, a simplified semantic role labeling framework is proposed to identify clauses and to detect zero pronouns effectively, and two effective methods (refining syntactic parser and refining learning example generation) are employed to exploit zero pronouns for Chinese coreference resolution.

In this paper we focus on learning gender differences in the use of subjective language in English, Spanish, and Russian Twitter data, and explore cross-cultural differences in emoticon and hashtag use for male and female users. We show that gender differences in subjective language can effectively be used to improve sentiment analysis, and in particular, polarity classification for Spanish and Russian.

<p>Author: Ruihong Huang ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: The goal of our research is to distinguish veterinary message board posts that describe a case involving a specific patient from posts that ask a general question. We create a text classifier that incorporates automatically generated attribute lists for veterinary patients to tackle this problem. Using a small amount of annotated data, we train an information extraction (IE) system to identify veterinary patient attributes. We then apply the IE system to a large collection of unannotated texts to produce a lexicon of veterinary patient attribute terms. Our experimental results show that using the learned attribute lists to encode patient information in the text classifier yields improved performance on this task.</p><p>4 0.76125342 <a title="112-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Cross-Lingual_Discriminative_Learning_of_Sequence_Models_with_Posterior_Regularization.html">53 emnlp-2013-Cross-Lingual Discriminative Learning of Sequence Models with Posterior Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev ; Dipanjan Das</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for cross-lingual transfer of sequence information from a resource-rich source language to a resourceimpoverished target language that incorporates soft constraints via posterior regularization. To this end, we use automatically word aligned bitext between the source and target language pair, and learn a discriminative conditional random field model on the target side. Our posterior regularization constraints are derived from simple intuitions about the task at hand and from cross-lingual alignment information. We show improvements over strong baselines for two tasks: part-of-speech tagging and namedentity segmentation.</p><p>5 0.67204165 <a title="112-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Open_Domain_Targeted_Sentiment.html">143 emnlp-2013-Open Domain Targeted Sentiment</a></p>
<p>Author: Margaret Mitchell ; Jacqui Aguilar ; Theresa Wilson ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to sentiment analysis for a low resource setting. The intuition behind this work is that sentiment expressed towards an entity, targeted sentiment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment expressed across the entity. This representation allows us to model sentiment detection as a sequence tagging problem, jointly discovering people and organizations along with whether there is sentiment directed towards them. We compare performance in both Spanish and English on microblog data, using only a sentiment lexicon as an external resource. By leveraging linguisticallyinformed features within conditional random fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empirical risk, our best models in Spanish significantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach around 90% accuracy on the combined task of named entity recognition and sentiment prediction. Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.</p><p>6 0.64121926 <a title="112-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Sarcasm_as_Contrast_between_a_Positive_Sentiment_and_Negative_Situation.html">163 emnlp-2013-Sarcasm as Contrast between a Positive Sentiment and Negative Situation</a></p>

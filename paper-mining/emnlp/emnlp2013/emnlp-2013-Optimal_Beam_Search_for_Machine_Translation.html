<p>Author: Hao Zhang ; Liang Huang ; Kai Zhao ; Ryan McDonald</p><p>Abstract: Online learning algorithms like the perceptron are widely used for structured prediction tasks. For sequential search problems, like left-to-right tagging and parsing, beam search has been successfully combined with perceptron variants that accommodate search errors (Collins and Roark, 2004; Huang et al., 2012). However, perceptron training with inexact search is less studied for bottom-up parsing and, more generally, inference over hypergraphs. In this paper, we generalize the violation-fixing perceptron of Huang et al. (2012) to hypergraphs and apply it to the cube-pruning parser of Zhang and McDonald (2012). This results in the highest reported scores on WSJ evaluation set (UAS 93.50% and LAS 92.41% respectively) without the aid of additional resources.</p><p>3 0.18206598 <a title="145-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Optimal_Incremental_Parsing_via_Best-First_Dynamic_Programming.html">146 emnlp-2013-Optimal Incremental Parsing via Best-First Dynamic Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Maryam Siahbani ; Baskaran Sankaran ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: Left-to-right (LR) decoding (Watanabe et al., 2006b) is a promising decoding algorithm for hierarchical phrase-based translation (Hiero). It generates the target sentence by extending the hypotheses only on the right edge. LR decoding has complexity O(n2b) for input of n words and beam size b, compared to O(n3) for the CKY algorithm. It requires a single language model (LM) history for each target hypothesis rather than two LM histories per hypothesis as in CKY. In this paper we present an augmented LR decoding algorithm that builds on the original algorithm in (Watanabe et al., 2006b). Unlike that algorithm, using experiments over multiple language pairs we show two new results: our LR decoding algorithm provides demonstrably more efficient decoding than CKY Hiero, four times faster; and by introducing new distortion and reordering features for LR decoding, it maintains the same translation quality (as in BLEU scores) ob- tained phrase-based and CKY Hiero with the same translation model.</p><p>5 0.16924627 <a title="145-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Max-Margin_Synchronous_Grammar_Induction_for_Machine_Translation.html">127 emnlp-2013-Max-Margin Synchronous Grammar Induction for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Traditional synchronous grammar induction estimates parameters by maximizing likelihood, which only has a loose relation to translation quality. Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>6 0.1473581 <a title="145-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Flexible_and_Efficient_Hypergraph_Interactions_for_Joint_Hierarchical_and_Forest-to-String_Decoding.html">88 emnlp-2013-Flexible and Efficient Hypergraph Interactions for Joint Hierarchical and Forest-to-String Decoding</a></p>

<p>Author: Heng Yu ; Liang Huang ; Haitao Mi ; Kai Zhao</p><p>Abstract: While large-scale discriminative training has triumphed in many NLP problems, its definite success on machine translation has been largely elusive. Most recent efforts along this line are not scalable (training on the small dev set with features from top ∼100 most frequent wt woridths) f eaantdu overly complicated. oWste f iren-stead present a very simple yet theoretically motivated approach by extending the recent framework of “violation-fixing perceptron”, using forced decoding to compute the target derivations. Extensive phrase-based translation experiments on both Chinese-to-English and Spanish-to-English tasks show substantial gains in BLEU by up to +2.3/+2.0 on dev/test over MERT, thanks to 20M+ sparse features. This is the first successful effort of large-scale online discriminative training for MT. 1Introduction Large-scale discriminative training has witnessed great success in many NLP problems such as parsing (McDonald et al., 2005) and tagging (Collins, 2002), but not yet for machine translation (MT) despite numerous recent efforts. Due to scalability issues, most of these recent methods can only train on a small dev set of about a thousand sentences rather than on the full training set, and only with 2,000–10,000 rather “dense-like” features (either unlexicalized or only considering highest-frequency words), as in MIRA (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008; Chiang, 2012), PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011), and RAMP (Gimpel and Smith, 2012). However, it is well-known that the most important features for NLP are lexicalized, most of which can not ∗ Work done while visiting City University of New York. Corresponding author. † 1112 be seen on a small dataset. Furthermore, these methods often involve complicated loss functions and intricate choices of the “target” derivations to update towards or against (e.g. k-best/forest oracles, or hope/fear derivations), and are thus hard to replicate. As a result, the classical method of MERT (Och, 2003) remains the default training algorithm for MT even though it can only tune a handful of dense features. See also Section 6 for other related work. As a notable exception, Liang et al. (2006) do train a structured perceptron model on the training data with sparse features, but fail to outperform MERT. We argue this is because structured perceptron, like many structured learning algorithms such as CRF and MIRA, assumes exact search, and search errors inevitably break theoretical properties such as convergence (Huang et al., 2012). Empirically, it is now well accepted that standard perceptron performs poorly when search error is severe (Collins and Roark, 2004; Zhang et al., 2013). To address the search error problem we propose a very simple approach based on the recent framework of “violation-fixing perceptron” (Huang et al., 2012) which is designed specifically for inexact search, with a theoretical convergence guarantee and excellent empirical performance on beam search parsing and tagging. The basic idea is to update when search error happens, rather than at the end of the search. To adapt it to MT, we extend this framework to handle latent variables corresponding to the hidden derivations. We update towards “gold-standard” derivations computed by forced decoding so that each derivation leads to the exact reference translation. Forced decoding is also used as a way of data selection, since those reachable sentence pairs are generally more literal and of higher quality, which the training should focus on. When the reachable subset is small for some language pairs, we augment Proce Sdeiantgtlse o,f W thaesh 2i0n1gt3o nC,o UnSfeAre,n 1c8e- o2n1 E Omctpoibriecra 2l0 M13et.h ?oc d2s0 i1n3 N Aastusorcaila Ltiaon g fuoarg Ceo Pmrpoucetastsi on ga,l p Laignegsu 1is1t1ic2s–1 23, it by including reachable prefix-pairs when the full sentence pair is not. We make the following contributions: 1. Our work is the first successful effort to scale online structured learning to a large portion of the training data (as opposed to the dev set). 2. Our work is the first to use a principled learning method customized for inexact search which updates on partial derivations rather than full ones in order to fix search errors. We adapt it to MT using latent variables for derivations. 3. Contrary to the common wisdom, we show that simply updating towards the exact reference translation is helpful, which is much simpler than k-best/forest oracles or loss-augmented (e.g. hope/fear) derivations, avoiding sentencelevel BLEU scores or other loss functions. 4. We present a convincing analysis that it is the search errors and standard perceptron’s inability to deal with them that prevent previous work, esp. Liang et al. (2006), from succeeding. 5. Scaling to the training data enables us to engineer a very rich feature set of sparse, lexicalized, and non-local features, and we propose various ways to alleviate overfitting. For simplicity and efficiency reasons, in this paper we use phrase-based translation, but our method has the potential to be applicable to other translation paradigms. Extensive experiments on both Chineseto-English and Spanish-to-English tasks show statistically significant gains in BLEU by up to +2.3/+2.0 on dev/test over MERT, and up to +1.5/+1.5 over PRO, thanks to 20M+ sparse features. 2 Phrase-Based MT and Forced Decoding We first review the basic phrase-based decoding algorithm (Koehn, 2004), which will be adapted for forced decoding. 2.1 Background: Phrase-based Decoding We will use the following running example from Chinese to English from Mi et al.

B `ush´ ı y uˇ Sh¯ al´ ong j ˇux ´ıng le hu` ıt´ an Bush with Sharon hold -ed meeting ‘Bush held a meeting with Sharon’ Phrase-based decoders generate partial targetlanguage outputs in left-to-right order in the form of hypotheses (or states) (Koehn, 2004). Each hypothesis has a coverage vector capturing the sourcelanguage words translated so far, and can be extended into a longer hypothesis by a phrase-pair translating an uncovered segment. For example, the following is one possible derivation: (• 3(• •() • :1( •s063),:“(Bs)u2s:,h)“(hBs:e1ul(d,s0“ht,aB“hleuk”ls) hdw”t)ailhkrsS1”h)aro2n”)r3 where a • in the coverage vector indicates the source wwoherdre a at •th i ns position aisg e“ vcoecvteorred in”d iacnadte ws thheer seo euarcche si is the score of each state, each adding the rule score and the distortion cost (dc) to the score of the previous state. To compute the distortion cost we also need to maintain the ending position of the last phrase (e.g., the 3 and 6 in the coverage vectors). In phrase-based translation there is also a distortionlimit which prohibits long-distance reorderings. The above states are called −LM states since they do Tnhoet ainbovovleve st language mlleodd −el LcMos tsst.a eTso iandcde a beiygram model, we split each −LM state into a series ogrfa +mL mMo states; ee sapchli t+ eaLcMh −staLtMe h satsa ttehe in ftoor ma (v,a) where a is the last word of the hypothesis.

<p>Author: Martin Cmejrek ; Haitao Mi ; Bowen Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Machine translation benefits from system combination. We propose flexible interaction of hypergraphs as a novel technique combining different translation models within one decoder. We introduce features controlling the interactions between the two systems and explore three interaction schemes of hiero and forest-to-string models—specification, generalization, and interchange. The experiments are carried out on large training data with strong baselines utilizing rich sets of dense and sparse features. All three schemes significantly improve results of any single system on four testsets. We find that specification—a more constrained scheme that almost entirely uses forest-to-string rules, but optionally uses hiero rules for shorter spans—comes out as the strongest, yielding improvement up to 0.9 (T -B )/2 points. We also provide a detailed experimental and qualitative analysis of the results.</p><p>6 0.55090874 <a title="145-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Left-to-Right_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation_with_Improved_Reordering.html">71 emnlp-2013-Efficient Left-to-Right Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation with Improved Reordering</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexander Rush ; Yin-Wen Chang ; Michael Collins</p><p>Abstract: Beam search is a fast and empirically effective method for translation decoding, but it lacks formal guarantees about search error. We develop a new decoding algorithm that combines the speed of beam search with the optimal certificate property of Lagrangian relaxation, and apply it to phrase- and syntax-based translation decoding. The new method is efficient, utilizes standard MT algorithms, and returns an exact solution on the majority of translation examples in our test data. The algorithm is 3.5 times faster than an optimized incremental constraint-based decoder for phrase-based translation and 4 times faster for syntax-based translation.</p><p>2 0.69107449 <a title="145-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Converting_Continuous-Space_Language_Models_into_N-Gram_Language_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">52 emnlp-2013-Converting Continuous-Space Language Models into N-Gram Language Models for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Wang ; Masao Utiyama ; Isao Goto ; Eiichro Sumita ; Hai Zhao ; Bao-Liang Lu</p><p>Abstract: Neural network language models, or continuous-space language models (CSLMs), have been shown to improve the performance of statistical machine translation (SMT) when they are used for reranking n-best translations. However, CSLMs have not been used in the first pass decoding of SMT, because using CSLMs in decoding takes a lot of time. In contrast, we propose a method for converting CSLMs into back-off n-gram language models (BNLMs) so that we can use converted CSLMs in decoding. We show that they outperform the original BNLMs and are comparable with the traditional use of CSLMs in reranking.</p><p>3 0.60534561 <a title="145-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised_Feature_Transformation_for_Dependency_Parsing.html">168 emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised Feature Transformation for Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenliang Chen ; Min Zhang ; Yue Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In current dependency parsing models, conventional features (i.e. base features) defined over surface words and part-of-speech tags in a relatively high-dimensional feature space may suffer from the data sparseness problem and thus exhibit less discriminative power on unseen data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach to addressing the problem by transforming the base features into high-level features (i.e. meta features) with the help of a large amount of automatically parsed data. The meta features are used together with base features in our final parser. Our studies indicate that our proposed approach is very effective in processing unseen data and features. Experiments on Chinese and English data sets show that the final parser achieves the best-reported accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known parsers on the English data.</p><p>4 0.50238556 <a title="145-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Dynamic_Feature_Selection_for_Dependency_Parsing.html">66 emnlp-2013-Dynamic Feature Selection for Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: He He ; Hal Daume III ; Jason Eisner</p><p>Abstract: Feature computation and exhaustive search have significantly restricted the speed of graph-based dependency parsing. We propose a faster framework of dynamic feature selection, where features are added sequentially as needed, edges are pruned early, and decisions are made online for each sentence. We model this as a sequential decision-making problem and solve it by imitation learning techniques. We test our method on 7 languages. Our dynamic parser can achieve accuracies comparable or even superior to parsers using a full set of features, while computing fewer than 30% of the feature templates.</p><p>5 0.48973903 <a title="145-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Structured_Penalties_for_Log-Linear_Language_Models.html">176 emnlp-2013-Structured Penalties for Log-Linear Language Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Anil Kumar Nelakanti ; Cedric Archambeau ; Julien Mairal ; Francis Bach ; Guillaume Bouchard</p><p>Abstract: Language models can be formalized as loglinear regression models where the input features represent previously observed contexts up to a certain length m. The complexity of existing algorithms to learn the parameters by maximum likelihood scale linearly in nd, where n is the length of the training corpus and d is the number of observed features. We present a model that grows logarithmically in d, making it possible to efficiently leverage longer contexts. We account for the sequential structure of natural language using treestructured penalized objectives to avoid overfitting and achieve better generalization.</p><p>6 0.48447162 <a title="145-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Application_of_Localized_Similarity_for_Web_Documents.html">24 emnlp-2013-Application of Localized Similarity for Web Documents</a></p>

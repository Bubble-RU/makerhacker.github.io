<p>Author: Shi Feng ; Le Zhang ; Binyang Li ; Daling Wang ; Ge Yu ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of the corpus-based method for classifying the word’s sentiment polarity. However, no work is done for comparing different corpora in the polarity classification task. Nowadays, Twitter has aggregated huge amount of data that are full of people’s sentiments. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the performance of different corpora in sentiment similarity measurement, which is the fundamental task for word polarity classification. Experiment results show that the Twitter data can achieve a much better performance than the Google, Web1T and Wikipedia based methods.</p><p>3 0.33728787 <a title="143-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Deep_Models_for_Semantic_Compositionality_Over_a_Sentiment_Treebank.html">158 emnlp-2013-Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Alex Perelygin ; Jean Wu ; Jason Chuang ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Semantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning of longer phrases in a principled way. Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.</p><p>4 0.33519739 <a title="143-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploring_Demographic_Language_Variations_to_Improve_Multilingual_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Social_Media.html">81 emnlp-2013-Exploring Demographic Language Variations to Improve Multilingual Sentiment Analysis in Social Media</a></p>

<p>Author: Ellen Riloff ; Ashequl Qadir ; Prafulla Surve ; Lalindra De Silva ; Nathan Gilbert ; Ruihong Huang</p><p>Abstract: A common form of sarcasm on Twitter consists of a positive sentiment contrasted with a negative situation. For example, many sarcastic tweets include a positive sentiment, such as “love” or “enjoy”, followed by an expression that describes an undesirable activity or state (e.g., “taking exams” or “being ignored”). We have developed a sarcasm recognizer to identify this type of sarcasm in tweets. We present a novel bootstrapping algorithm that automatically learns lists of positive sentiment phrases and negative situation phrases from sarcastic tweets. We show that identifying contrasting contexts using the phrases learned through bootstrapping yields improved recall for sarcasm recognition.</p><p>6 0.24088137 <a title="143-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Opinion_Target_Extraction_in_Chinese_Microblogs.html">47 emnlp-2013-Collective Opinion Target Extraction in Chinese Microblogs</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Scholz ; Stefan Conrad</p><p>Abstract: A very valuable piece of information in newspaper articles is the tonality of extracted statements. For the analysis of tonality of newspaper articles either a big human effort is needed, when it is carried out by media analysts, or an automated approach which has to be as accurate as possible for a Media Response Analysis (MRA). To this end, we will compare several state-of-the-art approaches for Opinion Mining in newspaper articles in this paper. Furthermore, we will introduce a new technique to extract entropy-based word connections which identifies the word combinations which create a tonality. In the evaluation, we use two different corpora consisting of news articles, by which we show that the new approach achieves better results than the four state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.67720294 <a title="143-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Sentiment_Analysis%3A_How_to_Derive_Prior_Polarities_from_SentiWordNet.html">170 emnlp-2013-Sentiment Analysis: How to Derive Prior Polarities from SentiWordNet</a></p>

<p>Author: Ruihong Huang ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: The goal of our research is to distinguish veterinary message board posts that describe a case involving a specific patient from posts that ask a general question. We create a text classifier that incorporates automatically generated attribute lists for veterinary patients to tackle this problem. Using a small amount of annotated data, we train an information extraction (IE) system to identify veterinary patient attributes. We then apply the IE system to a large collection of unannotated texts to produce a lexicon of veterinary patient attribute terms. Our experimental results show that using the learned attribute lists to encode patient information in the text classifier yields improved performance on this task.</p><p>4 0.76569676 <a title="143-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Cross-Lingual_Discriminative_Learning_of_Sequence_Models_with_Posterior_Regularization.html">53 emnlp-2013-Cross-Lingual Discriminative Learning of Sequence Models with Posterior Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev ; Dipanjan Das</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for cross-lingual transfer of sequence information from a resource-rich source language to a resourceimpoverished target language that incorporates soft constraints via posterior regularization. To this end, we use automatically word aligned bitext between the source and target language pair, and learn a discriminative conditional random field model on the target side. Our posterior regularization constraints are derived from simple intuitions about the task at hand and from cross-lingual alignment information. We show improvements over strong baselines for two tasks: part-of-speech tagging and namedentity segmentation.</p><p>5 0.73370779 <a title="143-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Cascading_Collective_Classification_for_Bridging_Anaphora_Recognition_using_a_Rich_Linguistic_Feature_Set.html">43 emnlp-2013-Cascading Collective Classification for Bridging Anaphora Recognition using a Rich Linguistic Feature Set</a></p>
<p>Author: Yufang Hou ; Katja Markert ; Michael Strube</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing bridging anaphora is difficult due to the wide variation within the phenomenon, the resulting lack of easily identifiable surface markers and their relative rarity. We develop linguistically motivated discourse structure, lexico-semantic and genericity detection features and integrate these into a cascaded minority preference algorithm that models bridging recognition as a subtask of learning finegrained information status (IS). We substantially improve bridging recognition without impairing performance on other IS classes.</p><p>6 0.72315162 <a title="143-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Coreference_Resolution_and_Named-Entity_Linking_with_Multi-Pass_Sieves.html">112 emnlp-2013-Joint Coreference Resolution and Named-Entity Linking with Multi-Pass Sieves</a></p>

<p>Author: Roy Schwartz ; Oren Tsur ; Ari Rappoport ; Moshe Koppel</p><p>Abstract: Work on authorship attribution has traditionally focused on long texts. In this work, we tackle the question of whether the author of a very short text can be successfully identified. We use Twitter as an experimental testbed. We introduce the concept of an author’s unique “signature”, and show that such signatures are typical of many authors when writing very short texts. We also present a new authorship attribution feature (“flexible patterns”) and demonstrate a significant improvement over our baselines. Our results show that the author of a single tweet can be identified with good accuracy in an array of flavors of the authorship attribution task.</p><p>3 0.10188183 <a title="37-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Application_of_Localized_Similarity_for_Web_Documents.html">24 emnlp-2013-Application of Localized Similarity for Web Documents</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Rebersek ; Mateja Verlic</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to automatic creation of anchor texts for hyperlinks in a document pointing to similar documents. Methods used in this approach rank parts of a document based on the similarity to a presumably related document. Ranks are then used to automatically construct the best anchor text for a link inside original document to the compared document. A number of different methods from information retrieval and natural language processing are adapted for this task. Automatically constructed anchor texts are manually evaluated in terms of relatedness to linked documents and compared to baseline consisting of originally inserted anchor texts. Additionally we use crowdsourcing for evaluation of original anchors and au- tomatically constructed anchors. Results show that our best adapted methods rival the precision of the baseline method.</p><p>4 0.090310477 <a title="37-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Orthonormal_Explicit_Topic_Analysis_for_Cross-Lingual_Document_Matching.html">148 emnlp-2013-Orthonormal Explicit Topic Analysis for Cross-Lingual Document Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: John Philip McCrae ; Philipp Cimiano ; Roman Klinger</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modelling has applications in machine translation, word sense disambiguation and terminology alignment. Multilingual extensions of approaches based on latent (LSI), generative (LDA, PLSI) as well as explicit (ESA) topic modelling can induce an interlingual topic space allowing documents in different languages to be mapped into the same space and thus to be compared across languages. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines latent and explicit topic modelling approaches in the sense that it builds on a set of explicitly defined topics, but then computes latent relations between these. Thus, the method combines the benefits of both explicit and latent topic modelling approaches. We show that on a crosslingual mate retrieval task, our model significantly outperforms LDA, LSI, and ESA, as well as a baseline that translates every word in a document into the target language.</p><p>5 0.085744672 <a title="37-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Unsupervised_Induction_of_Cross-Lingual_Semantic_Relations.html">193 emnlp-2013-Unsupervised Induction of Cross-Lingual Semantic Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Mike Lewis ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: Creating a language-independent meaning representation would benefit many crosslingual NLP tasks. We introduce the first unsupervised approach to this problem, learning clusters of semantically equivalent English and French relations between referring expressions, based on their named-entity arguments in large monolingual corpora. The clusters can be used as language-independent semantic relations, by mapping clustered expressions in different languages onto the same relation. Our approach needs no parallel text for training, but outperforms a baseline that uses machine translation on a cross-lingual question answering task. We also show how to use the semantics to improve the accuracy of machine translation, by using it in a simple reranker.</p><p>6 0.07884784 <a title="37-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised_Representation_Learning_for_Cross-Lingual_Text_Classification.html">169 emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised Representation Learning for Cross-Lingual Text Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Tieyun Qian ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of identifying users who use multiple userids to post in social media. Since multiple userids may belong to the same author, it is hard to directly apply supervised learning to solve the problem. This paper proposes a new method, which still uses supervised learning but does not require training documents from the involved userids. Instead, it uses documents from other userids for classifier building. The classifier can be applied to documents of the involved userids. This is possible because we transform the document space to a similarity space and learning is performed in this new space. Our evaluation is done in the online review domain. The experimental results using a large number of userids and their reviews show that the proposed method is highly effective. 1</p><p>3 0.54884893 <a title="37-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Orthonormal_Explicit_Topic_Analysis_for_Cross-Lingual_Document_Matching.html">148 emnlp-2013-Orthonormal Explicit Topic Analysis for Cross-Lingual Document Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Fan Yang ; Paul Vozila</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we report an empirical study on semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation using co-training. We utilize two segmenters: 1) a word-based segmenter leveraging a word-level language model, and 2) a character-based segmenter using characterlevel features within a CRF-based sequence labeler. These two segmenters are initially trained with a small amount of segmented data, and then iteratively improve each other using the large amount of unlabelled data. Our experimental results show that co-training captures 20% and 31% of the performance improvement achieved by supervised training with an order of magnitude more data for the SIGHAN Bakeoff 2005 PKU and CU corpora respectively.</p><p>3 0.96314639 <a title="37-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Systematic_Exploration_of_Diversity_in_Machine_Translation.html">15 emnlp-2013-A Systematic Exploration of Diversity in Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Gimpel ; Dhruv Batra ; Chris Dyer ; Gregory Shakhnarovich</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of producing a diverse set of plausible translations. We present a simple procedure that can be used with any statistical machine translation (MT) system. We explore three ways of using diverse translations: (1) system combination, (2) discriminative reranking with rich features, and (3) a novel post-editing scenario in which multiple translations are presented to users. We find that diversity can improve performance on these tasks, especially for sentences that are difficult for MT.</p><p>4 0.96047562 <a title="37-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Mining_Scientific_Terms_and_their_Definitions%3A_A_Study_of_the_ACL_Anthology.html">132 emnlp-2013-Mining Scientific Terms and their Definitions: A Study of the ACL Anthology</a></p>
<p>Author: Yiping Jin ; Min-Yen Kan ; Jun-Ping Ng ; Xiangnan He</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents DefMiner, a supervised sequence labeling system that identifies scientific terms and their accompanying definitions. DefMiner achieves 85% F1 on a Wikipedia benchmark corpus, significantly improving the previous state-of-the-art by 8%. We exploit DefMiner to process the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (ARC) – a large, real-world digital library of scientific articles in computational linguistics. The resulting automatically-acquired glossary represents the terminology defined over several thousand individual research articles. We highlight several interesting observations: more definitions are introduced for conference and workshop papers over the years and that multiword terms account for slightly less than half of all terms. Obtaining a list of popular , defined terms in a corpus ofcomputational linguistics papers, we find that concepts can often be categorized into one of three categories: resources, methodologies and evaluation metrics.</p><p>5 0.9518652 <a title="37-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Joint_Learning_Model_of_Word_Segmentation%2C_Lexical_Acquisition%2C_and_Phonetic_Variability.html">8 emnlp-2013-A Joint Learning Model of Word Segmentation, Lexical Acquisition, and Phonetic Variability</a></p>
<p>Author: Micha Elsner ; Sharon Goldwater ; Naomi Feldman ; Frank Wood</p><p>Abstract: We present a cognitive model of early lexical acquisition which jointly performs word segmentation and learns an explicit model of phonetic variation. We define the model as a Bayesian noisy channel; we sample segmentations and word forms simultaneously from the posterior, using beam sampling to control the size of the search space. Compared to a pipelined approach in which segmentation is performed first, our model is qualitatively more similar to human learners. On data with vari- able pronunciations, the pipelined approach learns to treat syllables or morphemes as words. In contrast, our joint model, like infant learners, tends to learn multiword collocations. We also conduct analyses of the phonetic variations that the model learns to accept and its patterns of word recognition errors, and relate these to developmental evidence.</p><p>6 0.90935016 <a title="37-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploring_Representations_from_Unlabeled_Data_with_Co-training_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation.html">82 emnlp-2013-Exploring Representations from Unlabeled Data with Co-training for Chinese Word Segmentation</a></p>

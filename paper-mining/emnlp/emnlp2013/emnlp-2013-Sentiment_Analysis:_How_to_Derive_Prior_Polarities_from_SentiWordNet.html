However, no work is done for comparing different corpora in the polarity classification task. Nowadays, Twitter has aggregated huge amount of data that are full of people’s sentiments.

<p>Author: Qi Zhang ; Jin Qian ; Huan Chen ; Jihua Kang ; Xuanjing Huang</p><p>Abstract: Explanatory sentences are employed to clarify reasons, details, facts, and so on. High quality online product reviews usually include not only positive or negative opinions, but also a variety of explanations of why these opinions were given. These explanations can help readers get easily comprehensible information of the discussed products and aspects. Moreover, explanatory relations can also benefit sentiment analysis applications. In this work, we focus on the task of identifying subjective text segments and extracting their corresponding explanations from product reviews in discourse level. We propose a novel joint extraction method using firstorder logic to model rich linguistic features and long distance constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p><p>4 0.20246737 <a title="170-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploring_Demographic_Language_Variations_to_Improve_Multilingual_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Social_Media.html">81 emnlp-2013-Exploring Demographic Language Variations to Improve Multilingual Sentiment Analysis in Social Media</a></p>

We show that gender differences in subjective language can effectively be used to improve sentiment analysis, and in particular, polarity classification for Spanish and Russian.

The intuition behind this work is that sentiment expressed towards an entity, targeted sentiment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment expressed across the entity. This representation allows us to model sentiment detection as a sequence tagging problem, jointly discovering people and organizations along with whether there is sentiment directed towards them. We compare performance in both Spanish and English on microblog data, using only a sentiment lexicon as an external resource. By leveraging linguisticallyinformed features within conditional random fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empirical risk, our best models in Spanish significantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach around 90% accuracy on the combined task of named entity recognition and sentiment prediction. Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.</p><p>6 0.13159387 <a title="170-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Opinion_Mining_in_Newspaper_Articles_by_Entropy-Based_Word_Connections.html">144 emnlp-2013-Opinion Mining in Newspaper Articles by Entropy-Based Word Connections</a></p>

<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev ; Dipanjan Das</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for cross-lingual transfer of sequence information from a resource-rich source language to a resourceimpoverished target language that incorporates soft constraints via posterior regularization. To this end, we use automatically word aligned bitext between the source and target language pair, and learn a discriminative conditional random field model on the target side. Our posterior regularization constraints are derived from simple intuitions about the task at hand and from cross-lingual alignment information. We show improvements over strong baselines for two tasks: part-of-speech tagging and namedentity segmentation.</p><p>4 0.47511649 <a title="170-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Open_Domain_Targeted_Sentiment.html">143 emnlp-2013-Open Domain Targeted Sentiment</a></p>
<p>Author: Margaret Mitchell ; Jacqui Aguilar ; Theresa Wilson ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to sentiment analysis for a low resource setting. The intuition behind this work is that sentiment expressed towards an entity, targeted sentiment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment expressed across the entity. This representation allows us to model sentiment detection as a sequence tagging problem, jointly discovering people and organizations along with whether there is sentiment directed towards them. We compare performance in both Spanish and English on microblog data, using only a sentiment lexicon as an external resource. By leveraging linguisticallyinformed features within conditional random fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empirical risk, our best models in Spanish significantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach around 90% accuracy on the combined task of named entity recognition and sentiment prediction. Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.</p><p>5 0.47275457 <a title="170-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Topics_and_Positions_from_Debatepedia.html">121 emnlp-2013-Learning Topics and Positions from Debatepedia</a></p>
<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Minghui Qiu ; Yanchuan Sim ; Jing Jiang ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We explore Debatepedia, a communityauthored encyclopedia of sociopolitical debates, as evidence for inferring a lowdimensional, human-interpretable representation in the domain of issues and positions. We introduce a generative model positing latent topics and cross-cutting positions that gives special treatment to person mentions and opinion words. We evaluate the resulting representation’s usefulness in attaching opinionated documents to arguments and its consistency with human judgments about positions.</p><p>6 0.47067294 <a title="170-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Sarcasm_as_Contrast_between_a_Positive_Sentiment_and_Negative_Situation.html">163 emnlp-2013-Sarcasm as Contrast between a Positive Sentiment and Negative Situation</a></p>

<p>Author: Mikhail Ageev ; Dmitry Lagun ; Eugene Agichtein</p><p>Abstract: Passage retrieval is a crucial first step of automatic Question Answering (QA). While existing passage retrieval algorithms are effective at selecting document passages most similar to the question, or those that contain the expected answer types, they do not take into account which parts of the document the searchers actually found useful. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful attempt to incorporate searcher examination data into passage retrieval for question answering. Specifically, we exploit detailed examination data, such as mouse cursor movements and scrolling, to infer the parts of the document the searcher found interesting, and then incorporate this signal into passage retrieval for QA. Our extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our method significantly improves passage retrieval, compared to using textual features alone. As an additional contribution, we make available to the research community the code and the search behavior data used in this study, with the hope of encouraging further research in this area.</p><p>3 0.10275164 <a title="33-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Detection_of_Product_Comparisons_-_How_Far_Does_an_Out-of-the-Box_Semantic_Role_Labeling_System_Take_You%3F.html">62 emnlp-2013-Detection of Product Comparisons - How Far Does an Out-of-the-Box Semantic Role Labeling System Take You?</a></p>
<p>Author: Wiltrud Kessler ; Jonas Kuhn</p><p>Abstract: This short paper presents a pilot study investigating the training of a standard Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) system on product reviews for the new task of detecting comparisons. An (opinionated) comparison consists of a comparative “predicate” and up to three “arguments”: the entity evaluated positively, the entity evaluated negatively, and the aspect under which the comparison is made. In user-generated product reviews, the “predicate” and “arguments” are expressed in highly heterogeneous ways; but since the elements are textually annotated in existing datasets, SRL is technically applicable. We address the interesting question how well training an outof-the-box SRL model works for English data. We observe that even without any feature engineering or other major adaptions to our task, the system outperforms a reasonable heuristic baseline in all steps (predicate identification, argument identification and argument classification) and in three different datasets.</p><p>4 0.091246247 <a title="33-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-The_VerbCorner_Project%3A_Toward_an_Empirically-Based_Semantic_Decomposition_of_Verbs.html">183 emnlp-2013-The VerbCorner Project: Toward an Empirically-Based Semantic Decomposition of Verbs</a></p>

A layered methodology to transform text into logic forms is proposed, and semantic features are derived from a logic prover. Experimental results show that incorporating the semantic structure of sentences is beneficial.

In the first stage, we train an SVM classifier to detect contradiction pattern pairs in a large web archive by exploiting the excitation polarity (Hashimoto et al., 2012) of the patterns. In the second stage, we enlarge the first stage classifier’s training data with new contradiction pairs obtained by combining the output of the first stage’s classifier and that of an entailment classifier. We acquired this way 750,000 typed Japanese contradiction pattern pairs with an estimated precision of 80%. We plan to release this resource to the NLP community. 1</p><p>4 0.45347244 <a title="33-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Noise-Aware_Character_Alignment_for_Bootstrapping_Statistical_Machine_Transliteration_from_Bilingual_Corpora.html">139 emnlp-2013-Noise-Aware Character Alignment for Bootstrapping Statistical Machine Transliteration from Bilingual Corpora</a></p>

<p>Author: Tao Ge ; Baobao Chang ; Sujian Li ; Zhifang Sui</p><p>Abstract: Since many applications such as timeline summaries and temporal IR involving temporal analysis rely on document timestamps, the task of automatic dating of documents has been increasingly important. Instead of using feature-based methods as conventional models, our method attempts to date documents in a year level by exploiting relative temporal relations between documents and events, which are very effective for dating documents. Based on this intuition, we proposed an eventbased time label propagation model called confidence boosting in which time label information can be propagated between documents and events on a bipartite graph. The experiments show that our event-based propagation model can predict document timestamps in high accuracy and the model combined with a MaxEnt classifier outperforms the state-ofthe-art method for this task especially when the size of the training set is small.</p><p>3 0.67524672 <a title="33-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Regularized_Minimum_Error_Rate_Training.html">159 emnlp-2013-Regularized Minimum Error Rate Training</a></p>
<p>Author: Michel Galley ; Chris Quirk ; Colin Cherry ; Kristina Toutanova</p><p>Abstract: Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) remains one of the preferred methods for tuning linear parameters in machine translation systems, yet it faces significant issues. First, MERT is an unregularized learner and is therefore prone to overfitting. Second, it is commonly used on a noisy, non-convex loss function that becomes more difficult to optimize as the number of parameters increases. To address these issues, we study the addition of a regularization term to the MERT objective function. Since standard regularizers such as ‘2 are inapplicable to MERT due to the scale invariance of its objective function, we turn to two regularizers—‘0 and a modification of‘2— and present methods for efficiently integrating them during search. To improve search in large parameter spaces, we also present a new direction finding algorithm that uses the gradient of expected BLEU to orient MERT’s exact line searches. Experiments with up to 3600 features show that these extensions of MERT yield results comparable to PRO, a learner often used with large feature sets.</p><p>4 0.59785068 <a title="33-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Russian_Stress_Prediction_using_Maximum_Entropy_Ranking.html">162 emnlp-2013-Russian Stress Prediction using Maximum Entropy Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Keith Hall ; Richard Sproat</p><p>Abstract: We explore a model of stress prediction in Russian using a combination of local contextual features and linguisticallymotivated features associated with the word’s stem and suffix. We frame this as a ranking problem, where the objective is to rank the pronunciation with the correct stress above those with incorrect stress. We train our models using a simple Maximum Entropy ranking framework allowing for efficient prediction. An empirical evaluation shows that a model combining the local contextual features and the linguistically-motivated non-local features performs best in identifying both primary and secondary stress. 1</p><p>5 0.57839954 <a title="33-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Relational_Inference_for_Wikification.html">160 emnlp-2013-Relational Inference for Wikification</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao Cheng ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Wikification, commonly referred to as Disambiguation to Wikipedia (D2W), is the task of identifying concepts and entities in text and disambiguating them into the most specific corresponding Wikipedia pages. Previous approaches to D2W focused on the use of local and global statistics over the given text, Wikipedia articles and its link structures, to evaluate context compatibility among a list of probable candidates. However, these methods fail (often, embarrassingly), when some level of text understanding is needed to support Wikification. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to Wikification by incorporating, along with statistical methods, richer relational analysis of the text. We provide an extensible, efficient and modular Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of Wikification that incorporates the entity-relation inference problem, and show that the ability to identify relations in text helps both candi- date generation and ranking Wikipedia titles considerably. Our results show significant improvements in both Wikification and the TAC Entity Linking task.</p><p>6 0.42359042 <a title="33-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Unified_Model_for_Topics%2C_Events_and_Users_on_Twitter.html">16 emnlp-2013-A Unified Model for Topics, Events and Users on Twitter</a></p>

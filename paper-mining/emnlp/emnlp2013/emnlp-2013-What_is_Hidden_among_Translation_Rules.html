<p>Author: Martin Cmejrek ; Haitao Mi ; Bowen Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Machine translation benefits from system combination. We propose flexible interaction of hypergraphs as a novel technique combining different translation models within one decoder. We introduce features controlling the interactions between the two systems and explore three interaction schemes of hiero and forest-to-string models—specification, generalization, and interchange. The experiments are carried out on large training data with strong baselines utilizing rich sets of dense and sparse features. All three schemes significantly improve results of any single system on four testsets. We find that specification—a more constrained scheme that almost entirely uses forest-to-string rules, but optionally uses hiero rules for shorter spans—comes out as the strongest, yielding improvement up to 0.9 (T -B )/2 points. We also provide a detailed experimental and qualitative analysis of the results.</p><p>3 0.2057517 <a title="201-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Max-Margin_Synchronous_Grammar_Induction_for_Machine_Translation.html">127 emnlp-2013-Max-Margin Synchronous Grammar Induction for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Traditional synchronous grammar induction estimates parameters by maximizing likelihood, which only has a loose relation to translation quality. Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>4 0.17451136 <a title="201-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Cross-Lingual_Discriminative_Learning_of_Sequence_Models_with_Posterior_Regularization.html">53 emnlp-2013-Cross-Lingual Discriminative Learning of Sequence Models with Posterior Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev ; Dipanjan Das</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for cross-lingual transfer of sequence information from a resource-rich source language to a resourceimpoverished target language that incorporates soft constraints via posterior regularization. To this end, we use automatically word aligned bitext between the source and target language pair, and learn a discriminative conditional random field model on the target side. Our posterior regularization constraints are derived from simple intuitions about the task at hand and from cross-lingual alignment information. We show improvements over strong baselines for two tasks: part-of-speech tagging and namedentity segmentation.</p><p>5 0.15909232 <a title="201-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Interactive_Machine_Translation_using_Hierarchical_Translation_Models.html">107 emnlp-2013-Interactive Machine Translation using Hierarchical Translation Models</a></p>

In contrast to traditional approaches that directly introduce syntactic constraints to translation rules by explicitly decorating them with syntactic annotations, which often exacerbate the data sparsity problem and cause other problems, our approach keeps translation rules intact and factorizes the use of syntactic constraints through two separate models: 1) a syntax mismatch model that associates each nonterminal of a translation rule with a distribution of tags that is used to measure the degree of syntactic compatibility of the translation rule on source spans; 2) a syntax-based reordering model that predicts whether a pair of sibling constituents in the constituent parse tree of the source sentence should be reordered or not when translated to the target language. The features produced by both models are used as soft constraints to guide the translation process. Experiments on Chinese-English translation show that the proposed approach significantly improves a strong string-to-dependency translation system on multiple evaluation sets.</p><p>6 0.58515459 <a title="201-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Translation_with_Source_Constituency_and_Dependency_Trees.html">187 emnlp-2013-Translation with Source Constituency and Dependency Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>4 0.69477308 <a title="201-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Opinion_Mining_in_Newspaper_Articles_by_Entropy-Based_Word_Connections.html">144 emnlp-2013-Opinion Mining in Newspaper Articles by Entropy-Based Word Connections</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Scholz ; Stefan Conrad</p><p>Abstract: A very valuable piece of information in newspaper articles is the tonality of extracted statements. For the analysis of tonality of newspaper articles either a big human effort is needed, when it is carried out by media analysts, or an automated approach which has to be as accurate as possible for a Media Response Analysis (MRA). To this end, we will compare several state-of-the-art approaches for Opinion Mining in newspaper articles in this paper. Furthermore, we will introduce a new technique to extract entropy-based word connections which identifies the word combinations which create a tonality. In the evaluation, we use two different corpora consisting of news articles, by which we show that the new approach achieves better results than the four state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.69201338 <a title="201-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Topics_and_Positions_from_Debatepedia.html">121 emnlp-2013-Learning Topics and Positions from Debatepedia</a></p>

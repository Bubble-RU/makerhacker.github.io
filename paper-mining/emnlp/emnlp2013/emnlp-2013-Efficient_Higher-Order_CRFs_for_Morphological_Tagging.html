</p><p>2 We show that our implementation yields fast and accurate morphological taggers across six languages with different morphological properties and that across languages higher-order models give significant improvements over 1st-order models. [sent-5, score-0.513]
</p><p>3 The training and also decoding times thus  depend polynomially on the size of the tagset and exponentially on the order of the CRF. [sent-9, score-0.257]
</p><p>4 This probably explains why CRFs, despite their outstanding accuracy, normally only are applied to tasks with small tagsets such as Named Entity Recognition and Chunking; if they are applied to tasks with bigger tagsets e. [sent-10, score-0.319]

</p><p>6 In this paper, we demonstrate that fast and accurate CRF training and tagging is possible for large tagsets of even thousands of tags by approximating the CRF objective function using coarse-to-fine decoding (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Rush and –  –  322 Petrov, 2012). [sent-13, score-0.432]
</p><p>7 Our pruned CRF (PCRF) model has much smaller runtime than higher-order CRF models and may thus lead to an even broader application of CRFs across NLP tagging tasks. [sent-14, score-0.234]
</p><p>8 We use POS tagging and combined POS and morphological (POS+MORPH) tagging to demonstrate the properties and benefits of our approach. [sent-15, score-0.385]
</p><p>9 POS+MORPH tagging is also a good example of a task where CRFs are rarely applied as the tagsets are often so big that even 1st-order dynamic programming is too expensive. [sent-18, score-0.314]
</p><p>10 A workaround is to restrict the possible tag candidates per position by using either morphological analyzers (MAs), dictionaries or heuristics (Haji ˇc, 2000). [sent-19, score-0.392]

</p><p>13 The tagsets in our experiments range from small sizes of 12 to large sizes of up to 1811. [sent-24, score-0.256]
</p><p>14 For the bigger tagset sizes we can reduce training times from several days to several hours. [sent-26, score-0.293]

</p><p>18 The probability of a tag sequence given a sentence is then given as:  y  x  p(~ y| x~) =expPtZ,iλ(λi~·, φ x~i)( y~,~ x,t) Z(~λ, ~x) = XexpXλi · φi( ~y, x~,t) Xy  Xt,i  Where t and iare token and feature indexes, φi is a feature function, λi is a feature weight and Z is a normalization constant.

</p><p>21 Naively, to later tag with nth-order accuracy we would train a series of n CRFs of increasing order. [sent-46, score-0.19]
</p><p>22 The main idea ofour approach is to create increasingly complex lattices and to filter candidate states at every step to prevent a polynomial increase in lattice size. [sent-51, score-0.274]
</p><p>23 T,th)e resulting reduced lattice is similar to what we would obtain using candidate selection based on an MA. [sent-56, score-0.22]
</p><p>24 We can now create a first order lattice by adding transitions to the pruned lattice and pruning with threshold τ1. [sent-57, score-0.658]
</p><p>25 The only difference to 0-order pruning is that we now have to run forward-backward to calculate the probabilities p(y| ~x, t). [sent-58, score-0.181]
</p><p>26 Note that in theory we eco tuheld parlosoba apply tsh pe( pruning Ntoo ttrean tshaittio inn probabilities of the form p(y, y0| x~, t) ; however, this does not seem to yield more accurate m hoowdeelvse ran, dth i ss less efficient than state pruning. [sent-59, score-0.115]
</p><p>27 The updates, however, are undefined if the gold sequence is pruned  from the lattice. [sent-64, score-0.183]
</p><p>28 A solution would be to simply reinsert the gold sequence, but this yields poor results as the model never learns to keep the gold sequence in the lower-order lattices. [sent-65, score-0.127]
</p><p>29 As an alternative we perform the gradient update with the highest lattice still containing the gold sequence. [sent-66, score-0.315]
</p><p>30 The lattice generation during decoding is identical, except that we always return a lattice of the highest order n. [sent-72, score-0.501]
</p><p>31 , training a maximum entropy model over a tagset of roughly 1800 tags and more than half a million instances is slow as we have to apply 1800 weight vector updates for every token in the training set and every SGD iteration. [sent-75, score-0.388]
</p><p>32 In the integrated model we only have to apply 1800 updates when we lose the gold sequence during filtering. [sent-76, score-0.139]
</p><p>33 Thus, in our implementation training a 0order model for Czech takes roughly twice as long  as training a 1st-order model. [sent-77, score-0.126]
</p><p>34 , the τi depend on the size of the tagset and should be adapted during training as we start the training with a uniform model that becomes more specific. [sent-81, score-0.238]
</p><p>35 We therefore set the τi by specifying µi, the average number of tags per position that should remain in the lattice after pruning. [sent-82, score-0.278]
</p><p>36 This also guarantees stable lattice sizes and thus stable training times. [sent-83, score-0.32]
</p><p>37 We achieve stable average number of tags per position by setting the τi dynamically during training: we measure the real average number of candidates per position µˆi and apply corrections after processing a certain fraction of the sentences of the training set. [sent-84, score-0.18]

</p><p>39 Here the 0-order lattice reduces the number of tags per position from 681 to 4 losing  roughly 15% of the gold sequences of the development set, which means that for 85% of the sentences the correct candidate is still in the lattice. [sent-88, score-0.325]
</p><p>40 To decrease the number of tag candidates in the 0-order model, we decode in two steps by separating the fully specified tag into a coarse-grained part-of-speech (POS) tag and a finegrained MORPH tag containing the morphological features. [sent-93, score-0.827]
</p><p>41 We then first build a lattice over POS candidates and apply our pruning strategy. [sent-94, score-0.415]
</p><p>42 In a second step we expand the remaining POS tags into all the combinations with MORPH tags that were seen in the training set. [sent-95, score-0.158]
</p><p>43 We thus build a sequence of lattices of both increasing order and increasing tag complexity. [sent-96, score-0.243]
</p><p>44 We also use an additional binary feature, which indicates whether the current word has been seen with the current tag or if the word is rare whether the tag is in a set of open tag classes. [sent-106, score-0.468]
</p><p>45 The open tag classes are estimated by 10-fold cross validation on the training set: We first use the folds to estimate how often a tag is seen with an unknown word. [sent-107, score-0.354]
</p><p>46 We then consider tags with a relative frequency ≥ 10−4 as open tag crl taasgsses w. [sent-108, score-0.214]

</p><p>48 For some experiments we also use the output of a morphological analyzer (MA). [sent-110, score-0.16]
</p><p>49 This approach is attractive because it does not require the output of the MA and the an–  –  notation of the treebank to be identical; in fact, it can even be used if treebank annotation and MA use completely different features. [sent-112, score-0.108]
</p><p>50 Because the weight vector dimensionality is high for large tagsets and productive languages, we use a hash kernel (Shi et al. [sent-113, score-0.14]
</p><p>51 (2005) use CRFs for POS+MORPH tagging, but use a morphological analyzer for candidate selection. [sent-116, score-0.16]

</p><p>54 It is unclear if their approach would also work for huge tag sets (> 1000). [sent-123, score-0.156]
</p><p>55 (2010) propose a modified Viterbi algorithm that is still optimal but depending on task and especially for big tag sets might be several orders of magnitude faster. [sent-127, score-0.199]
</p><p>56 4  Experiments  We run POS+MORPH tagging experiments on Arabic (ar), Czech (cs), Spanish (es), German (de) and Hungarian (hu). [sent-129, score-0.197]
</p><p>57 The following table shows the typetoken (T/T) ratio, the average number of tags of every word form that occurs more than once in the training set (A) and the number of tags of the most ambiguous word form  (Aˆ):  ArabicsadSehaseurmi0 Tti. [sent-130, score-0.235]
</p><p>58 Czech is a highly inflecting Slavic language with a large number of morphological features. [sent-136, score-0.123]
</p><p>59 It is also the language with the smallest tagset and the only language in our setup that with a few exceptions does not mark case. [sent-139, score-0.154]
</p><p>60 POS tagging experiments are run on all the languages above and also on English. [sent-146, score-0.273]
</p><p>61 2  Setup  To compare the training and decoding times we run all experiments on the same test machine, which features two Hexa-Core Intel Xeon X5680 CPUs with 3,33 GHz and 6 cores each and 144 GB of memory. [sent-169, score-0.169]
</p><p>62 The baseline tagger and our PCRF implementation are run single threaded. [sent-170, score-0.164]
</p><p>63 2 The taggers are im-  plemented in different programming languages and with different degrees of optimization; still, the run times are indicative of comparative performance to be expected in practice. [sent-171, score-0.142]
</p><p>64 Our Java implementation is always run with 10 SGD iterations and a regularization parameter of 0. [sent-172, score-0.108]
</p><p>65 As shown in Table 1 the tagset sizes range from 12 for Czech and Spanish to 54 and 57 for German and Hungarian, with Arabic (38) and English (45) in between. [sent-186, score-0.212]
</p><p>66 For all languages, training pruned higher-order models is faster than training unpruned 1st-order models and yields more accurate models. [sent-190, score-0.252]
</p><p>67 We can conclude that for small and medium tagset sizes PCRFs give substantial improvements in both training and decoding speed3 and thus allow for higher-order tagging, 2Our tagger might actually use more than one core because the Java garbage collection is run in parallel. [sent-194, score-0.51]
</p><p>68 327 which for all languages leads to significant4 accuracy improvements. [sent-196, score-0.11]
</p><p>69 4 POS+MORPH Oracle Experiments Ideally, for the full POS+MORPH tagset we would also compare our results to an unpruned CRF, but our implementation turned out to be too slow to do the required number of experiments. [sent-198, score-0.261]
</p><p>70 We therefore compare our model against models that perform oracle pruning, which means we perform standard pruning, but always keep the gold candidate in the lattice. [sent-201, score-0.136]
</p><p>71 The oracle pruning is applied during training and testing on the development set. [sent-202, score-0.246]
</p><p>72 The oracle model performance is thus an upper bound for the performance of an unpruned CRF. [sent-203, score-0.154]
</p><p>73 The most interesting pruning step happens at the 0-order level when we reduce from hundreds of candidates to just a couple. [sent-204, score-0.195]
</p><p>74 We can conclude that except for Czech and German losses due to pruning are insignificant. [sent-211, score-0.185]
</p><p>75 In this section, we investigate how big the improvements of higher-order models are. [sent-214, score-0.116]

</p><p>77 An analysis on the development set revealed that for all three languages, case is the morphological feature that benefits most from higher-order models. [sent-243, score-0.123]
</p><p>78 We can also conclude that the improvements for higher-order models are always higher than the loss we estimated in the oracle experiments. [sent-250, score-0.162]
</p><p>79 , Hungarian) we observe a small loss during 0-order pruning but we also have to expect less of an improvement when increasing 328 the order of the model. [sent-253, score-0.115]
</p><p>80 For languages with a high number of word form ambiguities (e. [sent-254, score-0.115]
</p><p>81 Surprisingly, we found that higher-order PCRF models can also avoid the pruning errors of lowerorder models. [sent-257, score-0.115]
</p><p>82 Our interpretation is that the correct nominative reading is pruned from the 0-order lattice. [sent-265, score-0.164]
</p><p>83 The lower weights of order-0 result in a more uniform posterior distribution and the nominative reading is not pruned from the lattice. [sent-267, score-0.164]
</p><p>84 We can see that the improvements due to higher-order models are orthogonal to the improvements due to MAs for all languages. [sent-284, score-0.146]
</p><p>85 For Arabic and German the improvements of higher-order models are bigger than the improvements due to MAs. [sent-286, score-0.185]
</p><p>86 For POS+MORPH tagging, all baselines are trained on the concatenation of POS tag and MORPH tag. [sent-291, score-0.156]
</p><p>87 The feature set is identical to our model except for some restrictions: we only use concatenations with the full tag and we do not use the binary feature that indicates whether a word-tag combination has been observed. [sent-304, score-0.156]
</p><p>88 We also had to restrict the combinations of tag and features to those observed in the training set5. [sent-305, score-0.198]
</p><p>89 Development set results for POS tagging are shown in Table 4. [sent-309, score-0.131]
</p><p>90 For the other languages we see improvements of 0. [sent-312, score-0.149]
</p><p>91 6 The POS+MORPH tagging development set results are presented in Table 6. [sent-317, score-0.131]
</p><p>92 The accuracy improvements of the best PCRF models over the best baseline models range from 0. [sent-322, score-0.107]
</p><p>93 The model is based on coarse-tofine decoding and stochastic gradient descent training with early updating. [sent-330, score-0.189]

</p><p>95 Furthermore, we showed that  training and tagging for approximated trigram and fourgram models is still faster than standard 1storder tagging, but yields significant improvements in accuracy. [sent-332, score-0.29]
</p><p>96 In oracle experiments with POS+MORPH tagsets we demonstrated that the losses due to our approximation depend on the word level ambiguity of the respective language and are moderate (≤ 0. [sent-333, score-0.385]
</p><p>97 We also showed that higher order tagging which is prohibitive for standard CRF implementations yields significant improvements over unpruned 1storder models. [sent-342, score-0.304]
</p><p>98 Analogous to the oracle experiments we observed big improvements for languages with a high level of POS+MORPH ambiguity such as German and smaller improvements for languages with less ambiguity such as Hungarian and Spanish. [sent-343, score-0.494]

Our posterior regularization constraints are derived from simple intuitions about the task at hand and from cross-lingual alignment information.

Developing models that learn multiple levels simultaneously can provide important insights into how these levels might interact synergistically dur- ing learning. Here, we present a model that jointly induces syntactic categories and morphological segmentations by combining two well-known models for the individual tasks. We test on child-directed utterances in English and Spanish and compare to single-task baselines. In the morphologically poorer language (English), the model improves morphological segmentation, while in the morphologically richer language (Spanish), it leads to better syntactic categorization. These results provide further evidence that joint learning is useful, but also suggest that the benefits may be different for typologically different languages.</p><p>5 0.11725771 <a title="70-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Deep_Learning_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_and_POS_Tagging.html">56 emnlp-2013-Deep Learning for Chinese Word Segmentation and POS Tagging</a></p>

We try to avoid task-specific feature engineering, and use deep layers of neural networks to discover relevant features to the tasks. We leverage large-scale unlabeled data to improve internal representation of Chinese characters, and use these improved representations to enhance supervised word segmentation and POS tagging models.

<p>Author: Rebecca Dridan</p><p>Abstract: A precise syntacto-semantic analysis of English requires a large detailed lexicon with the possibility of treating multiple tokens as a single meaning-bearing unit, a word-with-spaces. However parsing with such a lexicon, as included in the English Resource Grammar, can be very slow. We show that we can apply supertagging techniques over an ambiguous token lattice without resorting to previously used heuristics, a process we call ubertagging. Our model achieves an ubertagging accuracy that can lead to a four to eight fold speed up while improving parser accuracy. 1 Introduction and Motivation Over the last decade or so, supertagging has become a standard method for increasing parser efficiency for heavily lexicalised grammar formalisms such as LTAG (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999), CCG (Clark and Curran, 2007) and HPSG (Matsuzaki et al., 2007). In each of these systems, fine-grained lexical categories, known as supertags, are used to prune the parser search space prior to full syntactic parsing, leading to faster parsing at the risk of removing necessary lexical items. Various methods are used to configure the degree of pruning in order to balance this trade-off. The English Resource Grammar (ERG; Flickinger (2000)) is a large hand-written HPSGbased grammar of English that produces finegrained syntacto-semantic analyses. Given the high level of lexical ambiguity in its lexicon, parsing with the ERG should therefore also benefit from supertagging, but while various attempts have shown possibilities (Blunsom, 2007; Dridan et al., 2008; Dridan, 2009), supertagging is still not a standard element in the ERG parsing pipeline. 1201 There are two main reasons for this. The first is that the ERG lexicon does not assign simple atomic categories to words, but instead builds complex structured signs from information about lemmas and lexical rules, and hence the shape and integration of the supertags is not straightforward. Bangalore and Joshi (2010) define a supertag as a primitive structure that contains all the information about a lexical item, including argument structure, and where the arguments should be found. Within the ERG, that information is not all contained in the lexicon, but comes from different places. The choice, therefore, of what information may be predicted prior to parsing and how it should be integrated into parsing is an open question. The second reason that supertagging is not standard with ERG processing is one that is rarely considered when processing English, namely ambiguous segmentation. In most mainstream English parsing, the segmentation of parser input into tokens that will become the leaves of the parse tree is considered a fixed, unambiguous process. While recent work (Dridan and Oepen, 2012) has shown that producing even these tokens is not a solved problem, the issue we focus on here is the ambiguous mapping from these tokens to meaning-bearing units that we might call words. Within the ERG lexicon are many multi-token lexical entries that are sometimes referred to as words-with-spaces. These multi-token entries are added to the lexicon where the grammarian finds that the semantics of a fixed expression is non-compositional and has the distributional properties of other single word entries. Some examples include an adverb-like all of a sudden, a prepositionlike for example and an adjective-like over and done with. Each of these entries create an segmentation ambiguity between treating the whole expression as a single unit, or allowing analyses comprising enProce Sdeiantgtlse o,f W thaesh 2i0n1gt3o nC,o UnSfeAre,n 1c8e- o2n1 E Omctpoibriecra 2l0 M13et.h ?oc d2s0 i1n3 N Aastusorcaila Ltiaon g fuoarg Ceo Pmrpoucetastsi on ga,l p Laignegsu 1is2t0ic1s–1212, tries triggered by the individual tokens. Previous supertagging research using the ERG has either used the gold standard tokenisation, hence making the task artificially easier, or else tagged the individual tokens, using various heuristics to apply multi-token tags to single tokens. Neither approach has been wholly satisfactory. In this work we avoid the heuristic approaches and learn a sequential classification model that can simultaneously determine the most likely segmentation and supertag sequences, a process we dub ubertagging. We also experiment with more fine- grained tag sets than have been previously used, and find that it is possible to achieve a level of ubertagging accuracy that can improve both parser speed and accuracy for a precise semantic parser. 2 Previous Work As stated above, supertagging has become a standard tool for particular parsing paradigms, but the definitions of a supertag, the methods used to learn them, and the way they are used in parsing varies across formalisms. The original supertags were 300 LTAG elementary trees, predicted using a fairly simple trigram tagger that provided a configurable number of tags per token, since the tagger was not accurate enough to make assigning a single tree viable parser input (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999). The C&C; CCG parser uses a more complex Maximum Entropy tagger to assign tags from a set of 425 CCG lexical categories (Clark and Curran, 2007). They also found it necessary to supply more than one tag per token, and hence assign all tags that have a probability within a percentage β of the most likely tag for each token. Their standard parser configuration uses a very restrictive β value initially, relax- ing it when no parse can be found. Matsuzaki et al. (2007) use a supertagger similar to the C&C; tagger alongside a CFG filter to improve the speed of their HPSG parser, feeding sequences of single tags to the parser until a parse is possible. As in the ERG, category and inflectional information are separate in the automatically-extracted ENJU grammar: their supertag set consists of 1361 tags constructed by combining lexical categories and lexical rules. Figure 1 shows examples of supertags from these three tag sets, all describing the simple transitive use of lends. 1202 S NP0↓ VP VNP1↓ lends (a) LTAG (S[dcl]\NP)/NP (b) CCG [NP.nom NP.acc]-singular3rd verb rule (c) ENJU HPSG Figure 1: Examples of supertags from LTAG, CCG and ENJU HPSG, for the word lends. The ALPINO system for parsing Dutch is the closest in spirit to our ERG parsing setup, since it also uses a hand-written HPSG-based grammar, including multi-token entries in its lexicon. Prins and van Noord (2003) use a trigram HMM tagger to calculate the likelihood of up to 2392 supertags, and discard those that are not within τ of the most likely tag. For their multi-token entries, they assign a constructed category to each token, so that instead of assigning prepos it ion to the expression met betrekking tot (“with respect to”), they use ( 1 prepo s it ion ) , ( 2 prepo s it i ) , on ( 3 prepos it ion ) . Without these constructed categories, they would only have 1365 supertags. Most previous supertagging attempts with the ERG have used the grammar’s lexical types, which describe the coarse-grained part of speech, and the subcategorisation of a word, but not the inflection. Hence both lends and lent have a possible lexical type v np*pp* t o le, which indicates a verb, with optional noun phrase and prepositional phrase arguments, where the preposition has the form to. , , , The number of lexical types changes as the grammar grows, and is currently just over 1000. Dridan (2009) and Fares (2013) experimented with other tag types, but both found lexical types to be the optimal balance between predictability and efficiency. Both used a multi-tagging approach dubbed selective tagging to integrate the supertags into the parser. This involved only applying the supertag filter when the tag probability is above a configurable threshold, and not pruning otherwise. For multi-token entries, both Blunsom (2007) and adve rb adve rb adve rb adve rb ditt o ditt o 1 adve rb 2 adve rb 3 adve rb all in all , , , Figure 2: Options for tagging parts of the multitoken adverb all in all separately. Dridan (2009) assigned separate tags to each token, with Blunsom (2007) assigning a special ditto tag all but the initial token of a multi-token entry, while Dridan (2009) just assigned the same tag to each token (leading to example in the expression for example receiving p np i le, a preposition-type cate- gory). Both of these solutions (demonstrated in Figure 2), as well as that of Prins and van Noord (2003), in some ways defeat one of the purposes of treating these expressions as fixed units. The grammarian, by assigning the same category to, for example, all of a sudden and suddenly, is declaring that these two expressions have the same distributional properties, the properties that a sequential classifier is trying to exploit. Separating the tokens loses that information, and introduces extra noise into the sequence model. Ytrestøl (2012) and Fares (2013) treat the multientry tokens as single expressions for tagging, but with no ambiguity. Ytrestøl (2012) manages this by using gold standard tokenisation, which is, as he states, the standard practice for statistical parsing, but is an artificially simplified setup. Fares (2013) is the only work we know about that has tried to predict the final segmentation that the ERG produces. We compare segmentation accuracy between our joint model and his stand-alone tokeniser in Section 6. Looking at other instances of joint segmentation and tagging leads to work in non-whitespace separated languages such as Chinese (Zhang and Clark, 2010) and Japanese (Kudo et al., 2004). While at a high level, this work is solving the same problem, the shape of the problems are quite different from a data point of view. Regular joint morphological analysis and segmentation has much greater ambiguity in terms of possible segmentations but, in most cases, less ambiguity in terms of labelling than our situation. This also holds for other lemmatisation and morphological research, such as Toutanova and Cherry (2009).

Parsing in PET is divided in two stages. The first stage, lexical parsing, covers everything from tokenising the raw input string to populating the base of the parse chart with the appropriate lexical items, ready for the second syntactic parsing stage. In this work, we embed our ubertagging model between the two stages. By this point, the input has been segmented into what we call internal t okens, which broadly means — — splitting at whitespace and hyphens, and making ’s a separate token. These tokens are subject to a morphological analysis component which proposes possible inflectional and derivational rules based on word form, and then are used in retrieving possible lexical entries from the lexicon. The results of applying the appropriate lexical rules, plus affixation rules triggered by punctuation, to the lexical entries form a lexical item object, that for this work we dub a lexitem. Figure 3 shows some examples of lexitems instantiated after the lexical parsing stage when analysing Foreign lending increased as well. The pre-terminal labels on these subtrees are the lexical types that have previously been used as supertags for the ERG. For uninflected words, with no punctuation affixed, the lexical type is the only element in the lexitem, other than the word form (e.g. Foreign, as). In this example, we also see lexitems with inflectional rules (v prp ol r, v pst ol r), derivational rules (v nger-t r dl r) and punctuation affixation rules (w period pl r). These lexitems are put in to a chart, forming a lexical lattice, and it is over this lattice that we apply our ubertagging model, removing unlikely lexitems before they are seen by the syntactic parsing stage. 4 The Data The primary data sets we use in these experiments are from the 1.0 version of DeepBank (Flickinger et al., 2012), an HPSG annotation of the Wall Street Journal text used for the Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al. (1993)). The current version has gold standard annotations for approximately 85% of the first 22 sections. We follow the recommendations of the DeepBank developers in using Sections 00–19 for training, Section 20 (WSJ20) for development and Section 21 (WSJ21) as test data. In addition, we use two further sources of training data: the training portions of the LinGO Redwoods Treebank (Oepen et al., 2004), a steadily growing collection of gold standard HPSG annotations in a variety of domains; and the Wall Street Journal section of the North American News Corpus (NANC), which has been parsed, but not manually annotated. This builds on observations by Prins and van Noord (2003), Dridan (2009) and Ytrestøl (2012) that even uncorrected parser output makes very good train- ing data for a supertagger, since the constraints in the parser lead to viable, if not entirely correct sequences. This allows us to use much larger training sets than would be possible if we required manually annotated data. In final testing, we also include two further data sets to observe how domain affects the contribution of the ubertagging. These are both from the test portion of the Redwoods Treebank: CatB, an essay about open-source software;1 and WeScience13, 1http : / / catb .org/ esr /writ ings / 1204 text from Wikipedia articles about Natural Language Processing from the WeScience project (Ytrestøl et al., 2009). Table 1 summarises the vital statistics of the data we use. With the focus on multi-token lexitems, it is instructive to see just how frequent they are. In terms of type frequency, almost 10% of the approximately 38500 lexical entries in the current ERG lexicon have more than one token in their canonical form.2 However, while this is a significant percentage of the lexicon, they do not account for the same percentage of tokens during parsing. An analysis of WSJ00:19 shows that approximately one third of the sentences had at least one multi-token lexitem in the unpruned lexical lattice, and in just under half of those, the gold standard analysis included a multi-word entry. That gives the multi-token lexitems the awkward property of being rare enough to be difficult for a statistical classifier to accurately detect (just under 1% of the leaves of gold parse trees contain multiple tokens), but too frequent to ignore. In addition, since these multi-token expressions have often been distinguished because they are non-compositional, failing to detect the multi-word usage can lead to a disproportionately adverse effect on the semantic analysis of the text. 5 Ubertagging Model Our ubertagging model is very similar to a standard trigram Hidden Markov Model (HMM), except that the states are not all of the same length. Our states are based on the lexitems in the lexical lattice produced by the lexical parsing stage of PET, and as such, can be partially overlapping. We formalise this be defining each state by its start position, end po- sition, and tag. This turns out to make our model equivalent to a type of Hidden semi-Markov Model called a segmental HMM in Murphy (2002). In a segmental HMM, the states are segments with a tag (t) and a length in frames (l). In our setup, the frames are the ERG internal tokens and the segments are the lexitems, which are the potential candidates cathedral-baz aar / by Eric S. Raymond 2While the parser has mechanisms for handling words unknown to the lexicon, with the current grammar these mechanisms will never propose a multi-token lexitem, and so only the multi-token entries explicitly in the lexicon will be recognised as such.

As indicated above, the majority of segments (over 99%) will be one frame long, but segments of up to four frames are regularly seen in the training data. A standard trigram HMM has a transition proba- bility matrix A, where the elements Aijk represent the probability P(k|ij), and an emission probability tmhaetr pirxo bBa bwilhitoys eP (elke|mije),nt asn Bjo r eemcoisrdsi othne p probabilities P(o|j).

While v still indexes frames, qv now indicates a state that ends with frame v, and we look forwards and backwards to adjacent states, not frames, formally designated in terms of l, the length of the state.

To smooth these probabilities, we use deleted interpolation to calculate a weighted sum of the trigram, bigram and unigram probabilities, since it has been successfully used in effective PoS taggers like the TnT tagger (Brants, 2000). Future work will look more closely at the effects of different smoothing methods. 6 Intrinsic Ubertag Evaluation In order to develop and tune the ubertagging model, we first looked at segmentation and tagging performance in isolation over the development set. We looked at three tag granularities: lexical types (LTYPE) which have previously been shown to be the optimal granularity for supertagging with the ERG, inflected types (INFL) which encompass inflectional and derivational rules applied to the lexical type, and the full lexical item (FULL), which also includes affixation rules used for punctuation handling. Examples of each tag type are shown in Figure 4, along with the number of tags of each type seen in the training data. 4Since the multi-token lexical entries are defined because they have the same properties as the single token variants, there is no reason to think the length of a state should influence the tag sequence probability. 1206 Tag Type Segmentation F1 Sent.

Single sequence results Table 2 shows the results when considering the best path through the lattice. In terms of segmentation, our sentence accuracy is comparable to that of the stand-alone segmentation performance reported by Fares et al. (2013) over similar data.5 In that work, the authors used a binary CRF classifier to label points between objects they called micro-tokens as either SPLIT or NOSPLIT. The CRF classifier used a less informed input (since it was external to the parser), but a much more complex model, to produce a best single path sentence accuracy of 94.06%. Encouragingly, this level of segmentation performance was shown in later work to produce a viable parser input (Fares, 2013). Switching to the tagging results, we see that the F1 numbers are quite good for tag sets of this size.6 The best tag accuracy seen for ERG LTYPE-style tags was 95.55 in Ytrestøl (2012), using gold standard segmentation on a different data set. Dridan (2009) experimented with a tag granularity similar to our INFL (letype+morph) and saw a tag accuracy of 91.51, but with much less training data. From other formalisms, Kummerfeld et al. (2010) 5Fares et al. (2013) used a different section of an earlier version of DeepBank, but with the same style of annotation. 6We need to measure F1 rather than tag accuracy here, since the number of tokens tagged will vary according to the segmentation. report a single tag accuracy of 95.91, with the smaller CCG supertag set. Despite the promising tag F1 numbers however, the sentence level accuracy still indicates a performance level unacceptable for parser input. Comparing between tag types, we see that, possibly surprisingly, the more fine-grained tags are more accurately assigned, although the differences are small. While instinctively a larger tag set should present a more difficult problem, we find that this is mitigated both by the sparse lexical lattice provided by the parser, and by the extra constraints provided by the more informative tags. Multi-tagging results The multi-tagging methods from previous supertagging work becomes more complicated when dealing with ambiguous tokenisation. Where, in other setups, one can compare tag probabilities for all tags for a particular token, that no longer holds directly when tokens can partially overlap. Since ultimately, the parser uses lexitems which encompass segmentation and tagging information, we decided to use a simple integration method, where we remove any lexitem which our model assigns a probability below a certain threshold (ρ). The effect of the different tag granularities is now mediated by the relationship between the states in the ubertagging lattice and the lexitems in the parser’s lattice: for the FULL model, this is a one-to-one relationship, but states from the models that use coarser-grained tags may affect multiple lexitems. To illustrate this point, Figure 5 shows some lexitems for the token forecast,, where there are multiple possible analyses for the comma. A FULL tag of v cp le :v p st olr :w comma pl r will select only lexitem (b), whereas an INFL tag v cp le :v pst ol r will select (b) and (c) and the LTYPE tag v cp le picks out (a), (b) and (c). On the other hand, where there is no ambiguity in inflection or affixation, an LTYPE tag of n - mc le may relate to only a single lexitem ((f) in this case). Since we are using an absolute, rather than relative, threshold, the number needs to be tuned for each model7 and comparisons between models can only be made based on the effects (accuracy or pruning power) of the threshold. Table 3 shows how a selection of threshold values affect the accuracy 7A tag set size of 1028 will lead to higher probabilities in general than a tag set size of 21866. 1207 w comma-nf pl r w comma pl r w comma-n f pl r v pst ol r v pst o l r v cp le v cp le v cp le forecast, (a) w comma pl r forecast, (b) w comma pl r forecast, (c) v p st ol r v pas o l r w comma pl r v np le v np le n - mc le forecast, (d) forecast, (e) forecast, (f) Figure 5: Some of the lexitems triggered by forecast, in Despite the gloomy forecast, profits were up.

The pruning effect is given both as percentage of lexitems retained after pruning, and average number of lexitems per initial token.8 Comparison between the different models can be more easily made by examining Figure 6. Here we see clearly that the LTYPE model provides much less pruning for any given level of lexitem accuracy, while the performance of the other models is almost indistinguishable. Analysis The current state-of-the-art POS tagging accuracy (using the 45 tags in the PTB) is approximately 97.5%. The most restrictive ρ value we report for each model was selected to demonstrate that level of accuracy, which we can see would lead to pruning over 80% of lexitems when using FULL tags, an average of 1.56 tags per token. While this level of accuracy has been sufficient for statistical treebank parsing, previous work (Dridan, 2009) has shown that tag accuracy cannot directly predict parser performance, since errors of different types can have very different effects. This is hard to quantify without parsing, but we made a qualitative analysis at the lexitems that were incorrectly being 8The average number of lexitems per token for the unrestricted parser is 8.03, although the actual assignment is far from uniform, with up to 70 lexitems per token seen for the very ambiguous tokens. 1208 pruned. For all models, the most difficult lexitems to get correct were proper nouns, particular those that are also used as common nouns (e.g. Bank, Airline, Report). While capitalisation provides a clue here, it is not always deterministic, particularly since the treebank incorporates detailed decisions regarding the distinction between a name and a capitalised common noun that require real world knowledge, and are not necessarily always consistent. Almost two thirds of the errors made by the FULL and INFL models are related to these decisions, but only about 40% for the LTYPE model. The other errors are predominately over noun and verb type lexitems, as the open classes, with the only difference between models being that the FULL model seems marginally better at classifying verbs. The next section describes the end-to-end setup and results when parsing the development set. 7 Parsing With encouraging ubertagging results, we now take the next step and evaluate the effect on end-to-end parsing. Apart from the issue of different error types having unpredictable effects, there are two other factors that make the isolated ubertagging results only an approximate indication of parsing performance. The first confounding factor is the statistical parsing disambiguation model. To show the effect of ubertagging in a realistic configuration, we only evaluate the first analysis that the parser returns. That means that when the unrestricted parser does not rank the gold analysis first, errors made by our model may not be visible, because we would never see the gold analysis in any case. On the other hand, it is possible to improve parser accuracy by pruning incorrect lexitems that were in a top ranked, nongold analysis. The second new factor that parser integration brings to the picture is the effect of resource limitations. For reasons of tractability, PET is run with per sentence time and memory limits. For treebank creation, these limits are quite high (up to four minutes), but for these experiments, we set the timeout to a more practical 60 seconds and the memory limit to 2048Mb. Without lexical pruning, this leads to approximately 3% of sentences not receiving an analysis.

Table 4 shows the parsing results at the same threshold values used in Table 3. Accuracy is calculated in terms of F1 both over lexitems, and PARSEVAL-style labelled brackets (Black et al., 1991), while efficiency is represented by average parsing time per sentence. We can see here that an ubertagging F1 of below 98 (cf. Table 3) leads to a drop in parser accuracy, but that an ubertagging performance of between 98 and 99 can improve parser F1 while also achieving speed increases up to 8-fold. From the table we confirm that, contrary to earlier pipeline supertagging configurations, tags of a finer granularity than LTYPE can deliver better performance, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Again, comparing graphically in Figure 7 gives a clearer picture. Here we have graphed labelled bracket F1 against parsing time for the full range of threshold values explored, with the unpruned parsing results indicated by a cross. From this figure, we see that the INFL model, despite being marginally less accurate when measured in isolation, leads to slightly more accurate parse results than the FULL model at all levels of efficiency. Looking at the same graph for different samples of the development set (not shown) shows some 1209 Parser accuracy versus efficiency Time per sentence Figure 7: Labelled bracket F1 versus parsing time per sentence over the development set, for each of the different ubertagging models. The cross indicates unpruned performance, while the circle pinpoints the configuration we chose for the final test runs. variance in which threshold value gives the best F1, but the relative differences and basic curve shape re- mains the same. From these different views, using the guideline of maximum efficiency without harming accuracy we selected our final configuration: the INFL model with a threshold value of 0.001 (marked with a circle in Figure 7). On the development set, this configuration leads to a 1.75 point improvement in F1 in 27% of the parsing time. 8 Final Results Table 5 shows the results obtained when parsing using the configuration selected on the development set, over our three test sets. The first, WSJ21 is from the same domain as the development set. Here we see that the effect over the WSJ21 set fairly closely mirrored that of the development set, with an F1 increase of 1.81 in 29% of the parsing time. The Wikipedia domain of our WeScience13 test set, while very different to the newswire domain of the development set could still be considered in domain for the parsing and ubertagging models, since there is Wikipedia data in the training sets. With an average sentence length of 15.18 (compared to 18.86 in WSJ21), the baseline parsing time is faster than for WSJ21, and the speedup is not quite as large Data Set Baseline F1 Time Pruned F1 Time WSJ2188.126.0689.931.77 WeScience13 CatB 86.25 86.31 4.09 5.00 87.14 87.1 1 1.48 1.78 Table 5: Parsing accuracy in terms of labelled bracket F1 and average time per sentence when parsing the test sets, without pruning, and then with lexical pruning using the INFL model with a threshold of 0.001. but still welcome, at 36% of the baseline time. The increase is accuracy is likewise smaller (due to less issues with resource exhaustion in the baseline), but as our primary goal is to not harm accuracy, the results are pleasing. The CatB test set is the standard out-of-domain test for the parser, and is also out of domain for the ubertagging model. The average sentence length is not much below that of WSJ21, at 18.61, but the baseline parsing speed is still noticeably faster, which appears to be a reflection of greater structural ambiguity in the newswire text. We still achieve a reduction in parsing time to 35% of the baseline, again with a small improvement in accuracy. The across-the-board performance improvement on all our test sets suggests that, while tuning the pruning threshold could help, it is a robust parameter that can provide good performance across a variety of domains. This means that we finally have a robust supertagging setup for use with the ERG that doesn’t require heuristic shortcuts and can be reliably applied in general parsing. 9 Conclusions and Outlook In this work we have demonstrated a lexical disambiguation process dubbed ubertagging that can assign fine-grained supertags over an ambiguous token lattice, a setup previously ignored for English. It is the first completely integrated supertagging setup for use with the English Resource Grammar, which avoids the previously necessary heuristics for dealing with ambiguous tokenisation, and can be robustly configured for improved performance without loss of accuracy. Indeed, by learning a joint segmentation and supertagging model, we have been able to achieve usefully high tagging accuracies for very 1210 fine-grained tags, which leads to potential parser speedups of between 4 and 8 fold. Analysis of the tagging errors still being made have suggested some possibly avoidable inconsistencies in the grammar and treebank, which have been fed back to the developers, hopefully leading to even better results in the future. In future work, we will investigate more advanced smoothing methods to try and boost the ubertagging accuracy. We also intend to more fully explore the domain adaptation potentials of the lexical model that have been seen in other parsing setups (see Rimell and Clark (2008) for example), as well as examine the limits on the effects of more training data. Finally, we would like to explore just how much the statistic properties of our data dictate the success of the model by looking at related problems like morphological analysis of unsegmented languages such as Japanese.

KLC is designed to be a large scale corpus containing over 135 million words and conveying five stylistic genres: literary, publicistic, official, scientific and informal. Along with its primary part KLC comprises such parts as: (i) annotated sub-corpus, containing segmented documents encoded in the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) that marks complete morphological, syntactic, and structural characteristics of texts; (ii) as well as a sub-corpus with the annotated speech data. KLC has a web-based corpus management system that helps to navigate the data and retrieve necessary information.

<p>Author: Jun Seok Kang ; Polina Kuznetsova ; Michael Luca ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: This paper offers an approach for governments to harness the information contained in social media in order to make public inspections and disclosure more efficient. As a case study, we turn to restaurant hygiene inspections which are done for restaurants throughout the United States and in most of the world and are a frequently cited example of public inspections and disclosure. We present the first empirical study that shows the viability of statistical models that learn the mapping between textual signals in restaurant reviews and the hygiene inspection records from the Department of Public Health. The learned model achieves over 82% accuracy in discriminating severe – offenders from places with no violation, and provides insights into salient cues in reviews that are indicative of the restaurant’s sanitary conditions. Our study suggests that public disclosure policy can be improved by mining public opinions from social media to target inspections and to provide alternative forms of disclosure to customers.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7653873 <a title="70-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Higher-Order_CRFs_for_Morphological_Tagging.html">70 emnlp-2013-Efficient Higher-Order CRFs for Morphological Tagging</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Mueller ; Helmut Schmid ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: Training higher-order conditional random fields is prohibitive for huge tag sets. We present an approximated conditional random field using coarse-to-fine decoding and early updating. We show that our implementation yields fast and accurate morphological taggers across six languages with different morphological properties and that across languages higher-order models give significant improvements over 1st-order models.</p><p>3 0.59317517 <a title="70-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-The_Effects_of_Syntactic_Features_in_Automatic_Prediction_of_Morphology.html">181 emnlp-2013-The Effects of Syntactic Features in Automatic Prediction of Morphology</a></p>
<p>Author: Wolfgang Seeker ; Jonas Kuhn</p><p>Abstract: Morphology and syntax interact considerably in many languages and language processing should pay attention to these interdependencies. We analyze the effect of syntactic features when used in automatic morphology prediction on four typologically different languages. We show that predicting morphology for languages with highly ambiguous word forms profits from taking the syntactic context of words into account and results in state-ofthe-art models.</p><p>4 0.57887048 <a title="70-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Opinion_Target_Extraction_in_Chinese_Microblogs.html">47 emnlp-2013-Collective Opinion Target Extraction in Chinese Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinjie Zhou ; Xiaojun Wan ; Jianguo Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Microblog messages pose severe challenges for current sentiment analysis techniques due to some inherent characteristics such as the length limit and informal writing style. In this paper, we study the problem of extracting opinion targets of Chinese microblog messages. Such fine-grained word-level task has not been well investigated in microblogs yet. We propose an unsupervised label propagation algorithm to address the problem. The opinion targets of all messages in a topic are collectively extracted based on the assumption that similar messages may focus on similar opinion targets. Topics in microblogs are identified by hashtags or using clustering algorithms. Experimental results on Chinese microblogs show the effectiveness of our framework and algorithms.</p><p>5 0.57846493 <a title="70-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Deep_Learning_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_and_POS_Tagging.html">56 emnlp-2013-Deep Learning for Chinese Word Segmentation and POS Tagging</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoqing Zheng ; Hanyang Chen ; Tianyu Xu</p><p>Abstract: This study explores the feasibility of performing Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and POS tagging by deep learning. We try to avoid task-specific feature engineering, and use deep layers of neural networks to discover relevant features to the tasks. We leverage large-scale unlabeled data to improve internal representation of Chinese characters, and use these improved representations to enhance supervised word segmentation and POS tagging models. Our networks achieved close to state-of-theart performance with minimal computational cost. We also describe a perceptron-style algorithm for training the neural networks, as an alternative to maximum-likelihood method, to speed up the training process and make the learning algorithm easier to be implemented.</p><p>6 0.57311898 <a title="70-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Cross-Lingual_Discriminative_Learning_of_Sequence_Models_with_Posterior_Regularization.html">53 emnlp-2013-Cross-Lingual Discriminative Learning of Sequence Models with Posterior Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Oier Lopez de Lacalle ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an unsupervised approach to relational information extraction. Our model partitions tuples representing an observed syntactic relationship between two named entities (e.g., “X was born in Y” and “X is from Y”) into clusters corresponding to underlying semantic relation types (e.g., BornIn, Located). Our approach incorporates general domain knowledge which we encode as First Order Logic rules and automatically combine with a topic model developed specifically for the relation extraction task. Evaluation results on the ACE 2007 English Relation Detection and Categorization (RDC) task show that our model outperforms competitive unsupervised approaches by a wide margin and is able to produce clusters shaped by both the data and the rules.</p><p>3 0.067318991 <a title="195-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Fast_Joint_Compression_and_Summarization_via_Graph_Cuts.html">85 emnlp-2013-Fast Joint Compression and Summarization via Graph Cuts</a></p>
<p>Author: Xian Qian ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: Extractive summarization typically uses sentences as summarization units. In contrast, joint compression and summarization can use smaller units such as words and phrases, resulting in summaries containing more information. The goal of compressive summarization is to find a subset of words that maximize the total score of concepts and cutting dependency arcs under the grammar constraints and summary length constraint. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm for fast compressive summarization using graph cuts. Our approach first relaxes the length constraint using Lagrangian relaxation. Then we propose to bound the relaxed objective function by the supermodular binary quadratic programming problem, which can be solved efficiently using graph max-flow/min-cut. Since finding the tightest lower bound suffers from local optimality, we use convex relaxation for initialization. Experimental results on TAC2008 dataset demonstrate our method achieves competitive ROUGE score and has good readability, while is much faster than the integer linear programming (ILP) method.</p><p>4 0.061366115 <a title="195-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Breaking_Out_of_Local_Optima_with_Count_Transforms_and_Model_Recombination%3A_A_Study_in_Grammar_Induction.html">40 emnlp-2013-Breaking Out of Local Optima with Count Transforms and Model Recombination: A Study in Grammar Induction</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin I. Spitkovsky ; Hiyan Alshawi ; Daniel Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: Many statistical learning problems in NLP call for local model search methods. But accuracy tends to suffer with current techniques, which often explore either too narrowly or too broadly: hill-climbers can get stuck in local optima, whereas samplers may be inefficient. We propose to arrange individual local optimizers into organized networks. Our building blocks are operators of two types: (i) transform, which suggests new places to search, via non-random restarts from already-found local optima; and (ii) join, which merges candidate solutions to find better optima. Experiments on grammar induction show that pursuing different transforms (e.g., discarding parts of a learned model or ignoring portions of training data) results in improvements. Groups of locally-optimal solutions can be further perturbed jointly, by constructing mixtures. Using these tools, we designed several modular dependency grammar induction networks of increasing complexity. Our complete sys- tem achieves 48.6% accuracy (directed dependency macro-average over all 19 languages in the 2006/7 CoNLL data) more than 5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art. —</p><p>5 0.056233983 <a title="195-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Adaptor_Grammars_for_Learning_Non-Concatenative_Morphology.html">19 emnlp-2013-Adaptor Grammars for Learning Non-Concatenative Morphology</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan A. Botha ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: This paper contributes an approach for expressing non-concatenative morphological phenomena, such as stem derivation in Semitic languages, in terms of a mildly context-sensitive grammar formalism. This offers a convenient level of modelling abstraction while remaining computationally tractable. The nonparametric Bayesian framework of adaptor grammars is extended to this richer grammar formalism to propose a probabilistic model that can learn word segmentation and morpheme lexicons, including ones with discontiguous strings as elements, from unannotated data. Our experiments on Hebrew and three variants of Arabic data find that the additional expressiveness to capture roots and templates as atomic units improves the quality of concatenative segmentation and stem identification. We obtain 74% accuracy in identifying triliteral Hebrew roots, while performing morphological segmentation with an F1-score of 78. 1.</p><p>6 0.054787472 <a title="195-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Max-Margin_Synchronous_Grammar_Induction_for_Machine_Translation.html">127 emnlp-2013-Max-Margin Synchronous Grammar Induction for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: John Canny ; David Hall ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Constituency parsing with rich grammars remains a computational challenge. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have previously been used to accelerate CKY chart evaluation, but gains over CPU parsers were modest. In this paper, we describe a collection of new techniques that enable chart evaluation at close to the GPU’s practical maximum speed (a Teraflop), or around a half-trillion rule evaluations per second. Net parser performance on a 4-GPU system is over 1 thousand length30 sentences/second (1 trillion rules/sec), and 400 general sentences/second for the Berkeley Parser Grammar. The techniques we introduce include grammar compilation, recursive symbol blocking, and cache-sharing.</p><p>4 0.53861672 <a title="195-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Combining_PCFG-LA_Models_with_Dual_Decomposition%3A_A_Case_Study_with_Function_Labels_and_Binarization.html">50 emnlp-2013-Combining PCFG-LA Models with Dual Decomposition: A Case Study with Function Labels and Binarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Le Roux ; Antoine Rozenknop ; Jennifer Foster</p><p>Abstract: It has recently been shown that different NLP models can be effectively combined using dual decomposition. In this paper we demonstrate that PCFG-LA parsing models are suitable for combination in this way. We experiment with the different models which result from alternative methods of extracting a grammar from a treebank (retaining or discarding function labels, left binarization versus right binarization) and achieve a labeled Parseval F-score of 92.4 on Wall Street Journal Section 23 this represents an absolute improvement of 0.7 and an error reduction rate of 7% over a strong PCFG-LA product-model baseline. Although we experiment only with binarization and function labels in this study, there is much scope for applying this approach to – other grammar extraction strategies.</p><p>5 0.52840281 <a title="195-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Naive_Bayes_Word_Sense_Induction.html">138 emnlp-2013-Naive Bayes Word Sense Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Hongbo Chen ; Ben He</p><p>Abstract: Previous approaches for automated essay scoring (AES) learn a rating model by minimizing either the classification, regression, or pairwise classification loss, depending on the learning algorithm used. In this paper, we argue that the current AES systems can be further improved by taking into account the agreement between human and machine raters. To this end, we propose a rankbased approach that utilizes listwise learning to rank algorithms for learning a rating model, where the agreement between the human and machine raters is directly incorporated into the loss function. Various linguistic and statistical features are utilized to facilitate the learning algorithms. Experiments on the publicly available English essay dataset, Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP), show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, and achieves performance comparable to professional human raters, which suggests the effectiveness of our proposed method for automated essay scoring.</p><p>4 0.53613973 <a title="195-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Connecting_Language_and_Knowledge_Bases_with_Embedding_Models_for_Relation_Extraction.html">51 emnlp-2013-Connecting Language and Knowledge Bases with Embedding Models for Relation Extraction</a></p>

Our model is based on scoring functions that operate by learning low-dimensional embeddings of words, entities and relationships from a knowledge base. We empirically show on New York Times articles aligned with Freebase relations that our approach is able to efficiently use the extra information provided by a large subset of Freebase data (4M entities, 23k relationships) to improve over methods that rely on text features alone.</p><p>5 0.51209164 <a title="195-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Identifying_Multiple_Userids_of_the_Same_Author.html">95 emnlp-2013-Identifying Multiple Userids of the Same Author</a></p>
<p>Author: Tieyun Qian ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of identifying users who use multiple userids to post in social media. Since multiple userids may belong to the same author, it is hard to directly apply supervised learning to solve the problem. This paper proposes a new method, which still uses supervised learning but does not require training documents from the involved userids. Instead, it uses documents from other userids for classifier building. The classifier can be applied to documents of the involved userids. This is possible because we transform the document space to a similarity space and learning is performed in this new space. Our evaluation is done in the online review domain. The experimental results using a large number of userids and their reviews show that the proposed method is highly effective. 1</p><p>6 0.36930382 <a title="195-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Deep_Models_for_Semantic_Compositionality_Over_a_Sentiment_Treebank.html">158 emnlp-2013-Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank</a></p>

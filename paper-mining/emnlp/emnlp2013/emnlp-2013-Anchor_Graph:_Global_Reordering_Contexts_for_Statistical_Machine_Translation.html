<p>Author: Peter Rebersek ; Mateja Verlic</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to automatic creation of anchor texts for hyperlinks in a document pointing to similar documents. Methods used in this approach rank parts of a document based on the similarity to a presumably related document. Ranks are then used to automatically construct the best anchor text for a link inside original document to the compared document. A number of different methods from information retrieval and natural language processing are adapted for this task. Automatically constructed anchor texts are manually evaluated in terms of relatedness to linked documents and compared to baseline consisting of originally inserted anchor texts. Additionally we use crowdsourcing for evaluation of original anchors and au- tomatically constructed anchors. Results show that our best adapted methods rival the precision of the baseline method.</p><p>3 0.30582395 <a title="22-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Factored_Soft_Source_Syntactic_Constraints_for_Hierarchical_Machine_Translation.html">84 emnlp-2013-Factored Soft Source Syntactic Constraints for Hierarchical Machine Translation</a></p>

In contrast to traditional approaches that directly introduce syntactic constraints to translation rules by explicitly decorating them with syntactic annotations, which often exacerbate the data sparsity problem and cause other problems, our approach keeps translation rules intact and factorizes the use of syntactic constraints through two separate models: 1) a syntax mismatch model that associates each nonterminal of a translation rule with a distribution of tags that is used to measure the degree of syntactic compatibility of the translation rule on source spans; 2) a syntax-based reordering model that predicts whether a pair of sibling constituents in the constituent parse tree of the source sentence should be reordered or not when translated to the target language. The features produced by both models are used as soft constraints to guide the translation process. Experiments on Chinese-English translation show that the proposed approach significantly improves a strong string-to-dependency translation system on multiple evaluation sets.</p><p>4 0.22443943 <a title="22-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Autoencoders_for_ITG-Based_Translation.html">157 emnlp-2013-Recursive Autoencoders for ITG-Based Translation</a></p>

Unlike existing preordering models, we train feature-rich discriminative classifiers that directly predict the target-side word order. Our approach combines the strengths of lexical reordering and syntactic preordering models by performing long-distance reorderings using the structure of the parse tree, while utilizing a discriminative model with a rich set of features, including lexical features. We present extensive experiments on 22 language pairs, including preordering into English from 7 other languages.

Our method uses data collected from chat negotiations of the game The Settlers of Catan and exploits the conversation to construct dynamically a partial model of each player’s preferences. This in turn yields equilibrium trading moves via principles from game theory. We compare our method against four baselines and show that tracking how preferences evolve through the dialogue and reasoning about equilibrium moves are both crucial to success.</p><p>5 0.61023831 <a title="22-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Dynamic_Feature_Selection_for_Dependency_Parsing.html">66 emnlp-2013-Dynamic Feature Selection for Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: He He ; Hal Daume III ; Jason Eisner</p><p>Abstract: Feature computation and exhaustive search have significantly restricted the speed of graph-based dependency parsing. We propose a faster framework of dynamic feature selection, where features are added sequentially as needed, edges are pruned early, and decisions are made online for each sentence. We model this as a sequential decision-making problem and solve it by imitation learning techniques. We test our method on 7 languages. Our dynamic parser can achieve accuracies comparable or even superior to parsers using a full set of features, while computing fewer than 30% of the feature templates.</p><p>6 0.53438216 <a title="22-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Learning_and_Inference_for_Grammatical_Error_Correction.html">114 emnlp-2013-Joint Learning and Inference for Grammatical Error Correction</a></p>

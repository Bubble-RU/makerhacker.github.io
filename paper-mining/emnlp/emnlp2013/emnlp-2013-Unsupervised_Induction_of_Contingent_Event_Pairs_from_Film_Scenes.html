<p>Author: Gary Patterson ; Andrew Kehler</p><p>Abstract: We present a classification model that predicts the presence or omission of a lexical connective between two clauses, based upon linguistic features of the clauses and the type of discourse relation holding between them. The model is trained on a set of high frequency relations extracted from the Penn Discourse Treebank and achieves an accuracy of 86.6%. Analysis of the results reveals that the most informative features relate to the discourse dependencies between sequences of coherence relations in the text. We also present results of an experiment that provides insight into the nature and difficulty of the task.</p><p>3 0.12969525 <a title="192-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Discourse_Analysis_for_Article-Wide_Temporal_Classification.html">76 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Discourse Analysis for Article-Wide Temporal Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun-Ping Ng ; Min-Yen Kan ; Ziheng Lin ; Wei Feng ; Bin Chen ; Jian Su ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we classify the temporal relations between pairs of events on an article-wide basis. This is in contrast to much of the existing literature which focuses on just event pairs which are found within the same or adjacent sentences. To achieve this, we leverage on discourse analysis as we believe that it provides more useful semantic information than typical lexico-syntactic features. We propose the use of several discourse analysis frameworks, including 1) Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), 2) PDTB-styled discourse relations, and 3) topical text segmentation. We explain how features derived from these frameworks can be effectively used with support vector machines (SVM) paired with convolution kernels. Experiments show that our proposal is effective in improving on the state-of-the-art significantly by as much as 16% in terms of F1, even if we only adopt less-than-perfect automatic discourse analyzers and parsers. Making use of more accurate discourse analysis can further boost gains to 35%.</p><p>4 0.12206891 <a title="192-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Appropriately_Incorporating_Statistical_Significance_in_PMI.html">25 emnlp-2013-Appropriately Incorporating Statistical Significance in PMI</a></p>
<p>Author: Om P. Damani ; Shweta Ghonge</p><p>Abstract: Two recent measures incorporate the notion of statistical significance in basic PMI formulation. In some tasks, we find that the new measures perform worse than the PMI. Our analysis shows that while the basic ideas in incorporating statistical significance in PMI are reasonable, they have been applied slightly inappropriately. By fixing this, we get new measures that improve performance over not just PMI but on other popular co-occurrence measures as well. In fact, the revised measures perform reasonably well compared with more resource intensive non co-occurrence based methods also.</p><p>5 0.09626697 <a title="192-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Success_with_Style%3A_Using_Writing_Style_to_Predict_the_Success_of_Novels.html">178 emnlp-2013-Success with Style: Using Writing Style to Predict the Success of Novels</a></p>
<p>Author: Vikas Ganjigunte Ashok ; Song Feng ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Predicting the success of literary works is a curious question among publishers and aspiring writers alike. We examine the quantitative connection, if any, between writing style and successful literature. Based on novels over several different genres, we probe the predictive power of statistical stylometry in discriminating successful literary works, and identify characteristic stylistic elements that are more prominent in successful writings. Our study reports for the first time that statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effective in discriminating highly successful literature from less successful counterpart, achieving accuracy up to 84%. Closer analyses lead to several new insights into characteristics ofthe writing style in successful literature, including findings that are contrary to the conventional wisdom with respect to good writing style and readability. ,</p><p>6 0.090506516 <a title="192-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Language_Models_for_Visual_Recognition.html">78 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Language Models for Visual Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Julien Gaillard ; Marc El-Beze ; Eitan Altman ; Emmanuel Ethis</p><p>Abstract: Recommendation systems (RS) take advantage ofproducts and users information in order to propose items to consumers. Collaborative, content-based and a few hybrid RS have been developed in the past. In contrast, we propose a new domain-independent semantic RS. By providing textually well-argued recommendations, we aim to give more responsibility to the end user in his decision. The system includes a new similarity measure keeping up both the accuracy of rating predictions and coverage. We propose an innovative way to apply a fast adaptation scheme at a semantic level, providing recommendations and arguments in phase with the very recent past. We have performed several experiments on films data, providing textually well-argued recommendations.</p><p>5 0.48075479 <a title="192-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Success_with_Style%3A_Using_Writing_Style_to_Predict_the_Success_of_Novels.html">178 emnlp-2013-Success with Style: Using Writing Style to Predict the Success of Novels</a></p>

<p>Author: Sida Wang ; Mengqiu Wang ; Stefan Wager ; Percy Liang ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: NLP models have many and sparse features, and regularization is key for balancing model overfitting versus underfitting. A recently repopularized form of regularization is to generate fake training data by repeatedly adding noise to real data. We reinterpret this noising as an explicit regularizer, and approximate it with a second-order formula that can be used during training without actually generating fake data. We show how to apply this method to structured prediction using multinomial logistic regression and linear-chain CRFs. We tackle the key challenge of developing a dynamic program to compute the gradient of the regularizer efficiently. The regularizer is a sum over inputs, so we can estimate it more accurately via a semi-supervised or transductive extension. Applied to text classification and NER, our method provides a > 1% absolute performance gain over use of standard L2 regularization.</p><p>3 0.71774948 <a title="192-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatic_Feature_Engineering_for_Answer_Selection_and_Extraction.html">31 emnlp-2013-Automatic Feature Engineering for Answer Selection and Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Aliaksei Severyn ; Alessandro Moschitti</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for automatically engineering features for two important tasks of question answering: answer sentence selection and answer extraction. We represent question and answer sentence pairs with linguistic structures enriched by semantic information, where the latter is produced by automatic classifiers, e.g., question classifier and Named Entity Recognizer. Tree kernels applied to such structures enable a simple way to generate highly discriminative structural features that combine syntactic and semantic information encoded in the input trees. We conduct experiments on a public benchmark from TREC to compare with previous systems for answer sentence selection and answer extraction. The results show that our models greatly improve on the state of the art, e.g., up to 22% on F1 (relative improvement) for answer extraction, while using no additional resources and no manual feature engineering.</p><p>4 0.71712738 <a title="192-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Recurrent_Continuous_Translation_Models.html">156 emnlp-2013-Recurrent Continuous Translation Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Nal Kalchbrenner ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a class of probabilistic continuous translation models called Recurrent Continuous Translation Models that are purely based on continuous representations for words, phrases and sentences and do not rely on alignments or phrasal translation units. The models have a generation and a conditioning aspect. The generation of the translation is modelled with a target Recurrent Language Model, whereas the conditioning on the source sentence is modelled with a Convolutional Sentence Model. Through various experiments, we show first that our models obtain a perplexity with respect to gold translations that is > 43% lower than that of stateof-the-art alignment-based translation models. Secondly, we show that they are remarkably sensitive to the word order, syntax, and meaning of the source sentence despite lacking alignments. Finally we show that they match a state-of-the-art system when rescoring n-best lists of translations.</p><p>5 0.71670794 <a title="192-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-The_Answer_is_at_your_Fingertips%3A_Improving_Passage_Retrieval_for_Web_Question_Answering_with_Search_Behavior_Data.html">180 emnlp-2013-The Answer is at your Fingertips: Improving Passage Retrieval for Web Question Answering with Search Behavior Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Mikhail Ageev ; Dmitry Lagun ; Eugene Agichtein</p><p>Abstract: Passage retrieval is a crucial first step of automatic Question Answering (QA). While existing passage retrieval algorithms are effective at selecting document passages most similar to the question, or those that contain the expected answer types, they do not take into account which parts of the document the searchers actually found useful. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful attempt to incorporate searcher examination data into passage retrieval for question answering. Specifically, we exploit detailed examination data, such as mouse cursor movements and scrolling, to infer the parts of the document the searcher found interesting, and then incorporate this signal into passage retrieval for QA. Our extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our method significantly improves passage retrieval, compared to using textual features alone. As an additional contribution, we make available to the research community the code and the search behavior data used in this study, with the hope of encouraging further research in this area.</p><p>6 0.71598864 <a title="192-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Image_Description_using_Visual_Dependency_Representations.html">98 emnlp-2013-Image Description using Visual Dependency Representations</a></p>

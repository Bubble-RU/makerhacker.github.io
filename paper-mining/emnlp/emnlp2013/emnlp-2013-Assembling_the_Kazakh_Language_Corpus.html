<p>Author: Victor Chahuneau ; Eva Schlinger ; Noah A. Smith ; Chris Dyer</p><p>Abstract: Translation into morphologically rich languages is an important but recalcitrant problem in MT. We present a simple and effective approach that deals with the problem in two phases. First, a discriminative model is learned to predict inflections of target words from rich source-side annotations. Then, this model is used to create additional sentencespecific word- and phrase-level translations that are added to a standard translation model as “synthetic” phrases. Our approach relies on morphological analysis of the target language, but we show that an unsupervised Bayesian model of morphology can successfully be used in place of a supervised analyzer. We report significant improvements in translation quality when translating from English to Russian, Hebrew and Swahili.</p><p>4 0.073217943 <a title="26-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploring_Demographic_Language_Variations_to_Improve_Multilingual_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Social_Media.html">81 emnlp-2013-Exploring Demographic Language Variations to Improve Multilingual Sentiment Analysis in Social Media</a></p>

In this paper we focus on learning gender differences in the use of subjective language in English, Spanish, and Russian Twitter data, and explore cross-cultural differences in emoticon and hashtag use for male and female users. We show that gender differences in subjective language can effectively be used to improve sentiment analysis, and in particular, polarity classification for Spanish and Russian. Our results show statistically significant relative F-measure improvement over the gender-independent baseline 1.5% and 1% for Russian, 2% and 0.5% for Spanish, and 2.5% and 5% for English for polarity and subjectivity classification.</p><p>5 0.070913501 <a title="26-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Success_with_Style%3A_Using_Writing_Style_to_Predict_the_Success_of_Novels.html">178 emnlp-2013-Success with Style: Using Writing Style to Predict the Success of Novels</a></p>

We examine the quantitative connection, if any, between writing style and successful literature. Based on novels over several different genres, we probe the predictive power of statistical stylometry in discriminating successful literary works, and identify characteristic stylistic elements that are more prominent in successful writings. Our study reports for the first time that statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effective in discriminating highly successful literature from less successful counterpart, achieving accuracy up to 84%.

<p>Author: Keith Hall ; Richard Sproat</p><p>Abstract: We explore a model of stress prediction in Russian using a combination of local contextual features and linguisticallymotivated features associated with the word’s stem and suffix. We frame this as a ranking problem, where the objective is to rank the pronunciation with the correct stress above those with incorrect stress. We train our models using a simple Maximum Entropy ranking framework allowing for efficient prediction. An empirical evaluation shows that a model combining the local contextual features and the linguistically-motivated non-local features performs best in identifying both primary and secondary stress. 1</p><p>3 0.53071856 <a title="26-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Higher-Order_CRFs_for_Morphological_Tagging.html">70 emnlp-2013-Efficient Higher-Order CRFs for Morphological Tagging</a></p>

<p>Author: Xipeng Qiu ; Jiayi Zhao ; Xuanjing Huang</p><p>Abstract: Chinese word segmentation and part-ofspeech tagging (S&T;) are fundamental steps for more advanced Chinese language processing tasks. Recently, it has attracted more and more research interests to exploit heterogeneous annotation corpora for Chinese S&T.; In this paper, we propose a unified model for Chinese S&T; with heterogeneous annotation corpora. We first automatically construct a loose and uncertain mapping between two representative heterogeneous corpora, Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) and PKU’s People’s Daily (PPD) . Then we regard the Chinese S&T; with heterogeneous corpora as two “related” tasks and train our model on two heterogeneous corpora simultaneously. Experiments show that our method can boost the performances of both of the heterogeneous corpora by using the shared information, and achieves significant im- provements over the state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.43044162 <a title="26-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Automated_Essay_Scoring_by_Maximizing_Human-Machine_Agreement.html">28 emnlp-2013-Automated Essay Scoring by Maximizing Human-Machine Agreement</a></p>

<p>Author: Jinpeng Wang ; Wayne Xin Zhao ; Haitian Wei ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Hot trends are likely to bring new business opportunities. For example, “Air Pollution” might lead to a significant increase of the sales of related products, e.g., mouth mask. For ecommerce companies, it is very important to make rapid and correct response to these hot trends in order to improve product sales. In this paper, we take the initiative to study the task of how to identify trend related products. The major novelty of our work is that we automatically learn commercial intents revealed from microblogs. We carefully construct a data collection for this task and present quite a few insightful findings. In order to solve this problem, we further propose a graph based method, which jointly models relevance and associativity. We perform extensive experiments and the results showed that our methods are very effective.</p><p>2 0.70299047 <a title="26-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Grounding_Strategic_Conversation%3A_Using_Negotiation_Dialogues_to_Predict_Trades_in_a_Win-Lose_Game.html">91 emnlp-2013-Grounding Strategic Conversation: Using Negotiation Dialogues to Predict Trades in a Win-Lose Game</a></p>
<p>Author: Anais Cadilhac ; Nicholas Asher ; Farah Benamara ; Alex Lascarides</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a method that predicts which trades players execute during a winlose game. Our method uses data collected from chat negotiations of the game The Settlers of Catan and exploits the conversation to construct dynamically a partial model of each player’s preferences. This in turn yields equilibrium trading moves via principles from game theory. We compare our method against four baselines and show that tracking how preferences evolve through the dialogue and reasoning about equilibrium moves are both crucial to success.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.67732894 <a title="26-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Assembling_the_Kazakh_Language_Corpus.html">26 emnlp-2013-Assembling the Kazakh Language Corpus</a></p>

Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>5 0.53046459 <a title="26-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Structured_Penalties_for_Log-Linear_Language_Models.html">176 emnlp-2013-Structured Penalties for Log-Linear Language Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Anil Kumar Nelakanti ; Cedric Archambeau ; Julien Mairal ; Francis Bach ; Guillaume Bouchard</p><p>Abstract: Language models can be formalized as loglinear regression models where the input features represent previously observed contexts up to a certain length m. The complexity of existing algorithms to learn the parameters by maximum likelihood scale linearly in nd, where n is the length of the training corpus and d is the number of observed features. We present a model that grows logarithmically in d, making it possible to efficiently leverage longer contexts. We account for the sequential structure of natural language using treestructured penalized objectives to avoid overfitting and achieve better generalization.</p><p>6 0.53008062 <a title="26-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Personal_Profile_Summarization_with_Social_Networks.html">48 emnlp-2013-Collective Personal Profile Summarization with Social Networks</a></p>

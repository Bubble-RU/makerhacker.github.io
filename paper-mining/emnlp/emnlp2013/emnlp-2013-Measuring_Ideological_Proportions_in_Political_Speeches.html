<p>Author: Bowei Zou ; Guodong Zhou ; Qiaoming Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Scope detection is a key task in information extraction. This paper proposes a new approach for tree kernel-based scope detection by using the structured syntactic parse information. In addition, we have explored the way of selecting compatible features for different part-of-speech cues. Experiments on the BioScope corpus show that both constituent and dependency structured syntactic parse features have the advantage in capturing the potential relationships between cues and their scopes. Compared with the state of the art scope detection systems, our system achieves substantial improvement.</p><p>4 0.049910113 <a title="129-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Collective_Entity_Linking_with_Stacking.html">69 emnlp-2013-Efficient Collective Entity Linking with Stacking</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengyan He ; Shujie Liu ; Yang Song ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Houfeng Wang</p><p>Abstract: Entity disambiguation works by linking ambiguous mentions in text to their corresponding real-world entities in knowledge base. Recent collective disambiguation methods enforce coherence among contextual decisions at the cost of non-trivial inference processes. We propose a fast collective disambiguation approach based on stacking. First, we train a local predictor g0 with learning to rank as base learner, to generate initial ranking list of candidates. Second, top k candidates of related instances are searched for constructing expressive global coherence features. A global predictor g1 is trained in the augmented feature space and stacking is employed to tackle the train/test mismatch problem. The proposed method is fast and easy to implement. Experiments show its effectiveness over various algorithms on several public datasets. By learning a rich semantic relatedness measure be- . tween entity categories and context document, performance is further improved.</p><p>5 0.048624199 <a title="129-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Generative_Joint%2C_Additive%2C_Sequential_Model_of_Topics_and_Speech_Acts_in_Patient-Doctor_Communication.html">6 emnlp-2013-A Generative Joint, Additive, Sequential Model of Topics and Speech Acts in Patient-Doctor Communication</a></p>

<p>Author: Silvia Pareti ; Tim O'Keefe ; Ioannis Konstas ; James R. Curran ; Irena Koprinska</p><p>Abstract: Direct quotations are used for opinion mining and information extraction as they have an easy to extract span and they can be attributed to a speaker with high accuracy. However, simply focusing on direct quotations ignores around half of all reported speech, which is in the form of indirect or mixed speech. This work presents the first large-scale experiments in indirect and mixed quotation extraction and attribution. We propose two methods of extracting all quote types from news articles and evaluate them on two large annotated corpora, one of which is a contribution of this work. We further show that direct quotation attribution methods can be successfully applied to indirect and mixed quotation attribution.</p><p>4 0.2980563 <a title="129-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Tree_Kernel-based_Negation_and_Speculation_Scope_Detection_with_Structured_Syntactic_Parse_Features.html">188 emnlp-2013-Tree Kernel-based Negation and Speculation Scope Detection with Structured Syntactic Parse Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Matt Gardner ; Partha Pratim Talukdar ; Bryan Kisiel ; Tom Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: Automatically constructed Knowledge Bases (KBs) are often incomplete and there is a genuine need to improve their coverage. Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) is a recently proposed method which aims to improve KB coverage by performing inference directly over the KB graph. For the first time, we demonstrate that addition of edges labeled with latent features mined from a large dependency parsed corpus of 500 million Web documents can significantly outperform previous PRAbased approaches on the KB inference task. We present extensive experimental results validating this finding.

<p>Author: Fandong Meng ; Jun Xie ; Linfeng Song ; Yajuan Lu ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel translation model, which simultaneously exploits the constituency and dependency trees on the source side, to combine the advantages of two types of trees. We take head-dependents relations of dependency trees as backbone and incorporate phrasal nodes of constituency trees as the source side of our translation rules, and the target side as strings. Our rules hold the property of long distance reorderings and the compatibility with phrases. Large-scale experimental results show that our model achieves significantly improvements over the constituency-to-string (+2.45 BLEU on average) and dependencyto-string (+0.91 BLEU on average) models, which only employ single type of trees, and significantly outperforms the state-of-theart hierarchical phrase-based model (+1.12 BLEU on average), on three Chinese-English NIST test sets.</p><p>4 0.67279476 <a title="129-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Topics_and_Positions_from_Debatepedia.html">121 emnlp-2013-Learning Topics and Positions from Debatepedia</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>6 0.66377711 <a title="129-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Dataset_for_Research_on_Short-Text_Conversations.html">4 emnlp-2013-A Dataset for Research on Short-Text Conversations</a></p>

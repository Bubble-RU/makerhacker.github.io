<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Traditional synchronous grammar induction estimates parameters by maximizing likelihood, which only has a loose relation to translation quality. Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>4 0.16292216 <a title="136-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Monolingual_Marginal_Matching_for_Translation_Model_Adaptation.html">135 emnlp-2013-Monolingual Marginal Matching for Translation Model Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ann Irvine ; Chris Quirk ; Hal Daume III</p><p>Abstract: When using a machine translation (MT) model trained on OLD-domain parallel data to translate NEW-domain text, one major challenge is the large number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and new-translation-sense words. We present a method to identify new translations of both known and unknown source language words that uses NEW-domain comparable document pairs. Starting with a joint distribution of source-target word pairs derived from the OLD-domain parallel corpus, our method recovers a new joint distribution that matches the marginal distributions of the NEW-domain comparable document pairs, while minimizing the divergence from the OLD-domain distribution. Adding learned translations to our French-English MT model results in gains of about 2 BLEU points over strong baselines.</p><p>5 0.16047832 <a title="136-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Latent_Word_Representations_for_Domain_Adaptation_using_Supervised_Word_Clustering.html">120 emnlp-2013-Learning Latent Word Representations for Domain Adaptation using Supervised Word Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Min Xiao ; Feipeng Zhao ; Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation has been popularly studied on exploiting labeled information from a source domain to learn a prediction model in a target domain. In this paper, we develop a novel representation learning approach to address domain adaptation for text classification with automatically induced discriminative latent features, which are generalizable across domains while informative to the prediction task. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical multinomial Naive Bayes model with latent variables to conduct supervised word clustering on labeled documents from both source and target domains, and then use the produced cluster distribution of each word as its latent feature representation for domain adaptation. We train this latent graphical model us- ing a simple expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We empirically evaluate the proposed method with both cross-domain document categorization tasks on Reuters-21578 dataset and cross-domain sentiment classification tasks on Amazon product review dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance compared with alternative methods.</p><p>6 0.15636697 <a title="136-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Decoding_with_Large-Scale_Neural_Language_Models_Improves_Translation.html">55 emnlp-2013-Decoding with Large-Scale Neural Language Models Improves Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kevin Gimpel ; Dhruv Batra ; Chris Dyer ; Gregory Shakhnarovich</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of producing a diverse set of plausible translations. We present a simple procedure that can be used with any statistical machine translation (MT) system. We explore three ways of using diverse translations: (1) system combination, (2) discriminative reranking with rich features, and (3) a novel post-editing scenario in which multiple translations are presented to users. We find that diversity can improve performance on these tasks, especially for sentences that are difficult for MT.</p><p>4 0.69011813 <a title="136-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Building_Specialized_Bilingual_Lexicons_Using_Large_Scale_Background_Knowledge.html">42 emnlp-2013-Building Specialized Bilingual Lexicons Using Large Scale Background Knowledge</a></p>
<p>Author: Dhouha Bouamor ; Adrian Popescu ; Nasredine Semmar ; Pierre Zweigenbaum</p><p>Abstract: Bilingual lexicons are central components of machine translation and cross-lingual information retrieval systems. Their manual construction requires strong expertise in both languages involved and is a costly process. Several automatic methods were proposed as an alternative but they often rely on resources available in a limited number of languages and their performances are still far behind the quality of manual translations. We introduce a novel approach to the creation of specific domain bilingual lexicon that relies on Wikipedia. This massively multilingual encyclopedia makes it possible to create lexicons for a large number of language pairs. Wikipedia is used to extract domains in each language, to link domains between languages and to create generic translation dictionaries. The approach is tested on four specialized domains and is compared to three state of the art approaches using two language pairs: FrenchEnglish and Romanian-English. The newly introduced method compares favorably to existing methods in all configurations tested.</p><p>5 0.68330801 <a title="136-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Monolingual_Marginal_Matching_for_Translation_Model_Adaptation.html">135 emnlp-2013-Monolingual Marginal Matching for Translation Model Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Chia-ying Lee ; Yu Zhang ; James Glass</p><p>Abstract: The creation of a pronunciation lexicon remains the most inefficient process in developing an Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR). In this paper, we propose an unsupervised alternative requiring no language-specific knowledge to the conventional manual approach for creating pronunciation dictionaries. We present a hierarchical Bayesian model, which jointly discovers the phonetic inventory and the Letter-to-Sound (L2S) mapping rules in a language using only transcribed data. When tested on a corpus of spontaneous queries, the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed joint learning scheme over its sequential counterpart, in which the latent phonetic inventory and L2S mappings are learned separately. Furthermore, the recognizers built with the automatically induced lexicon consistently outperform grapheme-based recognizers and even approach the performance of recognition systems trained using – – conventional supervised procedures.</p><p>2 0.78193551 <a title="136-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-This_Text_Has_the_Scent_of_Starbucks%3A_A_Laplacian_Structured_Sparsity_Model_for_Computational_Branding_Analytics.html">184 emnlp-2013-This Text Has the Scent of Starbucks: A Laplacian Structured Sparsity Model for Computational Branding Analytics</a></p>
<p>Author: William Yang Wang ; Edward Lin ; John Kominek</p><p>Abstract: We propose a Laplacian structured sparsity model to study computational branding analytics. To do this, we collected customer reviews from Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, and other coffee shops across 38 major cities in the Midwest and Northeastern regions of USA. We study the brand related language use through these reviews, with focuses on the brand satisfaction and gender factors. In particular, we perform three tasks: automatic brand identification from raw text, joint brand-satisfaction prediction, and joint brandgender-satisfaction prediction. This work extends previous studies in text classification by incorporating the dependency and interaction among local features in the form of structured sparsity in a log-linear model. Our quantitative evaluation shows that our approach which combines the advantages of graphical modeling and sparsity modeling techniques significantly outperforms various standard and stateof-the-art text classification algorithms.

Weld</p><p>Abstract: The distributional hypothesis, which states that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings, has inspired several Web mining algorithms for paraphrasing semantically equivalent phrases. Unfortunately, these methods have several drawbacks, such as confusing synonyms with antonyms and causes with effects. This paper introduces three Temporal Correspondence Heuristics, that characterize regularities in parallel news streams, and shows how they may be used to generate high precision paraphrases for event relations. We encode the heuristics in a probabilistic graphical model to create the NEWSSPIKE algorithm for mining news streams. We present experiments demonstrating that NEWSSPIKE significantly outperforms several competitive baselines. In order to spur further research, we provide a large annotated corpus of timestamped news arti- cles as well as the paraphrases produced by NEWSSPIKE.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.72506088 <a title="136-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Multi-Domain_Adaptation_for_SMT_Using_Multi-Task_Learning.html">136 emnlp-2013-Multi-Domain Adaptation for SMT Using Multi-Task Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Cui ; Xilun Chen ; Dongdong Zhang ; Shujie Liu ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation for SMT usually adapts models to an individual specific domain. However, it often lacks some correlation among different domains where common knowledge could be shared to improve the overall translation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain adaptation approach for SMT using Multi-Task Learning (MTL), with in-domain models tailored for each specific domain and a general-domain model shared by different domains. The parameters of these models are tuned jointly via MTL so that they can learn general knowledge more accurately and exploit domain knowledge better. Our experiments on a largescale English-to-Chinese translation task validate that the MTL-based adaptation approach significantly and consistently improves the translation quality compared to a non-adapted baseline. Furthermore, it also outperforms the individual adaptation of each specific domain.</p><p>5 0.57113087 <a title="136-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Simulating_Early-Termination_Search_for_Verbose_Spoken_Queries.html">173 emnlp-2013-Simulating Early-Termination Search for Verbose Spoken Queries</a></p>
<p>Author: Jerome White ; Douglas W. Oard ; Nitendra Rajput ; Marion Zalk</p><p>Abstract: Building search engines that can respond to spoken queries with spoken content requires that the system not just be able to find useful responses, but also that it know when it has heard enough about what the user wants to be able to do so. This paper describes a simulation study with queries spoken by non-native speakers that suggests that indicates that finding relevant content is often possible within a half minute, and that combining features based on automatically recognized words with features designed for automated prediction of query difficulty can serve as a useful basis for predicting when that useful content has been found.</p><p>6 0.56744635 <a title="136-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Bilingual_Word_Embeddings_for_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation.html">38 emnlp-2013-Bilingual Word Embeddings for Phrase-Based Machine Translation</a></p>

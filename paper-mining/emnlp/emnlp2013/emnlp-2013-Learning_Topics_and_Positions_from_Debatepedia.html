<p>Author: Zhiyuan Chen ; Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu ; Meichun Hsu ; Malu Castellanos ; Riddhiman Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical models have been used for the task. However, such models without any domain knowledge often produce aspects that are not interpretable in applications. To tackle the issue, some knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which allow the user to input some prior domain knowledge to generate coherent aspects. However, existing knowledge-based topic models have several major shortcomings, e.g., little work has been done to incorporate the cannot-link type of knowledge or to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that MCLDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models markedly.</p><p>5 0.10084257 <a title="121-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Opinion_Target_Extraction_in_Chinese_Microblogs.html">47 emnlp-2013-Collective Opinion Target Extraction in Chinese Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinjie Zhou ; Xiaojun Wan ; Jianguo Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Microblog messages pose severe challenges for current sentiment analysis techniques due to some inherent characteristics such as the length limit and informal writing style. In this paper, we study the problem of extracting opinion targets of Chinese microblog messages. Such fine-grained word-level task has not been well investigated in microblogs yet. We propose an unsupervised label propagation algorithm to address the problem. The opinion targets of all messages in a topic are collectively extracted based on the assumption that similar messages may focus on similar opinion targets. Topics in microblogs are identified by hashtags or using clustering algorithms. Experimental results on Chinese microblogs show the effectiveness of our framework and algorithms.</p><p>6 0.10073091 <a title="121-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Is_Twitter_A_Better_Corpus_for_Measuring_Sentiment_Similarity%3F.html">109 emnlp-2013-Is Twitter A Better Corpus for Measuring Sentiment Similarity?</a></p>

<p>Author: James Foulds ; Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: When reviewing scientific literature, it would be useful to have automatic tools that identify the most influential scientific articles as well as how ideas propagate between articles. In this context, this paper introduces topical influence, a quantitative measure of the extent to which an article tends to spread its topics to the articles that cite it. Given the text of the articles and their citation graph, we show how to learn a probabilistic model to recover both the degree of topical influence of each article and the influence relationships between articles. Experimental results on corpora from two well-known computer science conferences are used to illustrate and validate the proposed approach.</p><p>5 0.38618118 <a title="121-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Opinion_Mining_in_Newspaper_Articles_by_Entropy-Based_Word_Connections.html">144 emnlp-2013-Opinion Mining in Newspaper Articles by Entropy-Based Word Connections</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Scholz ; Stefan Conrad</p><p>Abstract: A very valuable piece of information in newspaper articles is the tonality of extracted statements. For the analysis of tonality of newspaper articles either a big human effort is needed, when it is carried out by media analysts, or an automated approach which has to be as accurate as possible for a Media Response Analysis (MRA). To this end, we will compare several state-of-the-art approaches for Opinion Mining in newspaper articles in this paper. Furthermore, we will introduce a new technique to extract entropy-based word connections which identifies the word combinations which create a tonality. In the evaluation, we use two different corpora consisting of news articles, by which we show that the new approach achieves better results than the four state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.37519282 <a title="121-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Opinion_Target_Extraction_in_Chinese_Microblogs.html">47 emnlp-2013-Collective Opinion Target Extraction in Chinese Microblogs</a></p>

<p>Author: Svitlana Volkova ; Theresa Wilson ; David Yarowsky</p><p>Abstract: Theresa Wilson Human Language Technology Center of Excellence Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD t aw@ j hu .edu differences may Different demographics, e.g., gender or age, can demonstrate substantial variation in their language use, particularly in informal contexts such as social media. In this paper we focus on learning gender differences in the use of subjective language in English, Spanish, and Russian Twitter data, and explore cross-cultural differences in emoticon and hashtag use for male and female users. We show that gender differences in subjective language can effectively be used to improve sentiment analysis, and in particular, polarity classification for Spanish and Russian. Our results show statistically significant relative F-measure improvement over the gender-independent baseline 1.5% and 1% for Russian, 2% and 0.5% for Spanish, and 2.5% and 5% for English for polarity and subjectivity classification.</p><p>2 0.92756355 <a title="121-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Classifying_Message_Board_Posts_with_an_Extracted_Lexicon_of_Patient_Attributes.html">46 emnlp-2013-Classifying Message Board Posts with an Extracted Lexicon of Patient Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruihong Huang ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: The goal of our research is to distinguish veterinary message board posts that describe a case involving a specific patient from posts that ask a general question. We create a text classifier that incorporates automatically generated attribute lists for veterinary patients to tackle this problem. Using a small amount of annotated data, we train an information extraction (IE) system to identify veterinary patient attributes. We then apply the IE system to a large collection of unannotated texts to produce a lexicon of veterinary patient attribute terms. Our experimental results show that using the learned attribute lists to encode patient information in the text classifier yields improved performance on this task.</p><p>3 0.89484203 <a title="121-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Cross-Lingual_Discriminative_Learning_of_Sequence_Models_with_Posterior_Regularization.html">53 emnlp-2013-Cross-Lingual Discriminative Learning of Sequence Models with Posterior Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev ; Dipanjan Das</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for cross-lingual transfer of sequence information from a resource-rich source language to a resourceimpoverished target language that incorporates soft constraints via posterior regularization. To this end, we use automatically word aligned bitext between the source and target language pair, and learn a discriminative conditional random field model on the target side. Our posterior regularization constraints are derived from simple intuitions about the task at hand and from cross-lingual alignment information. We show improvements over strong baselines for two tasks: part-of-speech tagging and namedentity segmentation.</p><p>4 0.81797493 <a title="121-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Open_Domain_Targeted_Sentiment.html">143 emnlp-2013-Open Domain Targeted Sentiment</a></p>

Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.80713421 <a title="121-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Topics_and_Positions_from_Debatepedia.html">121 emnlp-2013-Learning Topics and Positions from Debatepedia</a></p>
<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Minghui Qiu ; Yanchuan Sim ; Jing Jiang ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We explore Debatepedia, a communityauthored encyclopedia of sociopolitical debates, as evidence for inferring a lowdimensional, human-interpretable representation in the domain of issues and positions. We introduce a generative model positing latent topics and cross-cutting positions that gives special treatment to person mentions and opinion words. We evaluate the resulting representation’s usefulness in attaching opinionated documents to arguments and its consistency with human judgments about positions.</p><p>6 0.80675852 <a title="121-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Sarcasm_as_Contrast_between_a_Positive_Sentiment_and_Negative_Situation.html">163 emnlp-2013-Sarcasm as Contrast between a Positive Sentiment and Negative Situation</a></p>

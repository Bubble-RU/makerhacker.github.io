<p>Author: Congle Zhang ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: The distributional hypothesis, which states that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings, has inspired several Web mining algorithms for paraphrasing semantically equivalent phrases. Unfortunately, these methods have several drawbacks, such as confusing synonyms with antonyms and causes with effects. This paper introduces three Temporal Correspondence Heuristics, that characterize regularities in parallel news streams, and shows how they may be used to generate high precision paraphrases for event relations. We encode the heuristics in a probabilistic graphical model to create the NEWSSPIKE algorithm for mining news streams. We present experiments demonstrating that NEWSSPIKE significantly outperforms several competitive baselines. In order to spur further research, we provide a large annotated corpus of timestamped news arti- cles as well as the paraphrases produced by NEWSSPIKE.</p><p>3 0.17166443 <a title="64-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Using_Paraphrases_and_Lexical_Semantics_to_Improve_the_Accuracy_and_the_Robustness_of_Supervised_Models_in_Situated_Dialogue_Systems.html">197 emnlp-2013-Using Paraphrases and Lexical Semantics to Improve the Accuracy and the Robustness of Supervised Models in Situated Dialogue Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Xuchen Yao ; Benjamin Van Durme ; Chris Callison-Burch ; Peter Clark</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel discriminative model for phrase-based monolingual alignment using a semi-Markov CRF. Our model achieves stateof-the-art alignment accuracy on two phrasebased alignment datasets (RTE and paraphrase), while doing significantly better than other strong baselines in both non-identical alignment and phrase-only alignment. Additional experiments highlight the potential benefit of our alignment model to RTE, paraphrase identification and question answering, where even a naive application of our modelâ€™s alignment score approaches the state ofthe art.</p><p>5 0.12124078 <a title="64-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Walk-Based_Semantically_Enriched_Tree_Kernel_Over_Distributed_Word_Representations.html">17 emnlp-2013-A Walk-Based Semantically Enriched Tree Kernel Over Distributed Word Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Shashank Srivastava ; Dirk Hovy ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a walk-based graph kernel that generalizes the notion of treekernels to continuous spaces. Our proposed approach subsumes a general framework for word-similarity, and in particular, provides a flexible way to incorporate distributed representations. Using vector representations, such an approach captures both distributional semantic similarities among words as well as the structural relations between them (encoded as the structure of the parse tree). We show an efficient formulation to compute this kernel using simple matrix operations. We present our results on three diverse NLP tasks, showing state-of-the-art results.</p><p>6 0.10758968 <a title="64-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised_Representation_Learning_for_Cross-Lingual_Text_Classification.html">169 emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised Representation Learning for Cross-Lingual Text Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Kai-Wei Chang ; Wen-tau Yih ; Christopher Meek</p><p>Abstract: We present Multi-Relational Latent Semantic Analysis (MRLSA) which generalizes Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). MRLSA provides an elegant approach to combining multiple relations between words by constructing a 3-way tensor. Similar to LSA, a lowrank approximation of the tensor is derived using a tensor decomposition. Each word in the vocabulary is thus represented by a vector in the latent semantic space and each relation is captured by a latent square matrix. The degree of two words having a specific relation can then be measured through simple linear algebraic operations. We demonstrate that by integrating multiple relations from both homogeneous and heterogeneous information sources, MRLSA achieves state- of-the-art performance on existing benchmark datasets for two relations, antonymy and is-a.</p><p>5 0.44861415 <a title="64-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_to_Rank_Lexical_Substitutions.html">123 emnlp-2013-Learning to Rank Lexical Substitutions</a></p>
<p>Author: Gyorgy Szarvas ; Robert Busa-Fekete ; Eyke Hullermeier</p><p>Abstract: The problem to replace a word with a synonym that fits well in its sentential context is known as the lexical substitution task. In this paper, we tackle this task as a supervised ranking problem. Given a dataset of target words, their sentential contexts and the potential substitutions for the target words, the goal is to train a model that accurately ranks the candidate substitutions based on their contextual fitness. As a key contribution, we customize and evaluate several learning-to-rank models to the lexical substitution task, including classification-based and regression-based approaches. On two datasets widely used for lexical substitution, our best models signifi- cantly advance the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.39763939 <a title="64-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Log-Linear_Model_for_Unsupervised_Text_Normalization.html">9 emnlp-2013-A Log-Linear Model for Unsupervised Text Normalization</a></p>

<p>Author: Anil Kumar Nelakanti ; Cedric Archambeau ; Julien Mairal ; Francis Bach ; Guillaume Bouchard</p><p>Abstract: Language models can be formalized as loglinear regression models where the input features represent previously observed contexts up to a certain length m. The complexity of existing algorithms to learn the parameters by maximum likelihood scale linearly in nd, where n is the length of the training corpus and d is the number of observed features. We present a model that grows logarithmically in d, making it possible to efficiently leverage longer contexts.

<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>4 0.56467956 <a title="64-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Max-Margin_Synchronous_Grammar_Induction_for_Machine_Translation.html">127 emnlp-2013-Max-Margin Synchronous Grammar Induction for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Traditional synchronous grammar induction estimates parameters by maximizing likelihood, which only has a loose relation to translation quality. Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>5 0.56369019 <a title="64-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Study_on_Bootstrapping_Bilingual_Vector_Spaces_from_Non-Parallel_Data_%28and_Nothing_Else%29.html">13 emnlp-2013-A Study on Bootstrapping Bilingual Vector Spaces from Non-Parallel Data (and Nothing Else)</a></p>

We test the quality of the induced bilingual vector spaces, and analyze the influence of the different components of the bootstrapping approach in the task of bilingual lexicon extraction (BLE) for two language pairs. Results reveal that, contrary to conclusions from prior work, the seeding of the bootstrapping process has a heavy impact on the quality of the learned lexicons. We also show that our approach outperforms the best performing fully corpus-based BLE methods on these test sets.</p><p>6 0.56274104 <a title="64-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Autoencoders_for_ITG-Based_Translation.html">157 emnlp-2013-Recursive Autoencoders for ITG-Based Translation</a></p>

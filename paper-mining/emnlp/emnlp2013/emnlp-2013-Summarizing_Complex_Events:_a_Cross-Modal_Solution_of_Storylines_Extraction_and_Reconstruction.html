<p>Author: Lifu Huang ; Lian'en Huang</p><p>Abstract: Recently, much research focuses on event storyline generation, which aims to produce a concise, global and temporal event summary from a collection of articles. Generally, each event contains multiple sub-events and the storyline should be composed by the component summaries of all the sub-events. However, different sub-events have different part-whole relationship with the major event, which is important to correspond to users’ interests but seldom considered in previous work. To distinguish different types of sub-events, we propose a mixture-event-aspect model which models different sub-events into local and global aspects. Combining these local/global aspects with summarization requirements together, we utilize an optimization method to generate the component summaries along the timeline. We develop experimental systems on 6 distinctively different datasets. Evaluation and comparison results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p><p>3 0.27922714 <a title="179-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-MCTest%3A_A_Challenge_Dataset_for_the_Open-Domain_Machine_Comprehension_of_Text.html">126 emnlp-2013-MCTest: A Challenge Dataset for the Open-Domain Machine Comprehension of Text</a></p>

Previous work on machine comprehension (e.g., semantic modeling) has made great strides, but primarily focuses either on limited-domain datasets, or on solving a more restricted goal (e.g., open-domain relation extraction). In contrast, MCTest requires machines to answer multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about fictional stories, directly tackling the high-level goal of open-domain machine comprehension. Reading comprehension can test advanced abilities such as causal reasoning and understanding the world, yet, by being multiple-choice, still provide a clear metric. By being fictional, the answer typically can be found only in the story itself. The stories and questions are also carefully limited to those a young child would understand, reducing the world knowledge that is required for the task. We present the scalable crowd-sourcing methods that allow us to cheaply construct a dataset of 500 stories and 2000 questions. By screening workers (with grammar tests) and stories (with grading), we have ensured that the data is the same quality as another set that we manually edited, but at one tenth the editing cost. By being open-domain, yet carefully restricted, we hope MCTest will serve to encourage research and provide a clear metric for advancement on the machine comprehension of text. 1 Reading Comprehension A major goal for NLP is for machines to be able to understand text as well as people. Several research 193 semantic role labeling, and recognizing textual entailment. Yet these techniques are necessarily evaluated individually, rather than by how much they advance us towards the end goal. On the other hand, the goal of semantic parsing is the machine comprehension of text (MCT), yet its evaluation requires adherence to a specific knowledge representation, and it is currently unclear what the best representation is, for open-domain text. We believe that it is useful to directly tackle the top-level task of MCT. For this, we need a way to measure progress. One common method for evaluating someone’s understanding of text is by giving them a multiple-choice reading comprehension test. This has the advantage that it is objectively gradable (vs. essays) yet may test a range of abilities such as causal or counterfactual reasoning, inference among relations, or just basic understanding of the world in which the passage is set. Therefore, we propose a multiple-choice reading comprehension task as a way to evaluate progress on MCT. We have built a reading comprehension dataset containing 500 fictional stories, with 4 multiple choice questions per story. It was built using methods which can easily scale to at least 5000 stories, since the stories were created, and the curation was done, using crowd sourcing almost entirely, at a total of $4.00 per story. We plan to periodically update the dataset to ensure that methods are not overfitting to the existing data. The dataset is open-domain, yet restricted to concepts and words that a 7 year old is expected to understand. This task is still beyond the capability of today’s computers and algorithms.

The multiple choice task avoids ambiguities (such as when the task is to find a sentence that best matches a question, as in some early reading comprehension tasks: see Section 2), and also avoids the need for additional grading, such as is needed in some TREC tasks. The stories were chosen to be fictional to focus work on finding the answer in the story itself, rather than in knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia; the goal is to build technology that actually understands stories and paragraphs on a deep level (as opposed to using information retrieval methods and the redundancy of the web to find the answers). We chose to use crowd sourcing, as opposed to, for example, contracting teachers or paying for existing standardized tests, for three reasons, namely: (1) scalability, both for the sizes of datasets we can provide, and also for the ease of regularly refreshing the data; (2) for the variety in story-telling that having many different authors brings; and (3) for the free availability that can only result from providing non-copyrighted data. The content is freely available at http://research.microsoft.com/mct, and we plan to use that site to track published results and provide other resources, such as labels of various kinds. 2 Previous Work The research goal of mapping text to meaning representations in order to solve particular tasks has a long history. DARPA introduced the Airline Travel Information System (ATIS) in the early 90’s: there the task was to slot-fill flight-related information by modeling the intent of spoken language (see Tur et al., 2010, for a review). This data continues to be a used in the semantic modeling community (see, for example, Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2009). The Geoquery database contains 880 geographical facts about the US and has played a similar role for written (as opposed to spoken) natural language queries against a database (Zelle and Mooney, 1996) and it also continues to spur research (see for example Goldwasser et al., 2011), as does the similar Jobs database, which provides mappings of 640 sentences to a listing of jobs 194 (Tang and Mooney, 2001). More recently, Zweig and Burges (2012) provided a set of 1040 sentences that comprise an SAT-style multiple choice sentence completion task. The idea of using story-based reading comprehension questions to evaluate methods for machine reading itself goes back over a decade, when Hirschmann et al. (1999) showed that a bag of words approach, together with some heuristic linguistic modeling, could achieve 40% accuracy for the task of picking the sentence that best matches the query for “who / what / when / where / why” questions, on a small reading comprehension dataset from Remedia. This dataset spurred several research efforts, for example using reinforcement learning (Grois and Wilkins, 2005), named entity resolution (Harabagiu et al., 2003) and mapping questions and answers to logical form (Wellner et al., 2006). Work on story understanding itself goes back much further, to 1972, when Charniak proposed using a background model to answer questions about children’s stories. Similarly, the TREC (and TAC) Question Answering tracks (e.g., Voorhees and Tice, 1999) aim to evaluate systems on their ability to answer factual questions such as “Where is the Taj Mahal”. The QA4MRE task also aims to evaluate machine reading systems through question answering (e.g., Clark et al., 2012). Earlier work has also aimed at controlling the scope by limiting the text to children’s stories: Breck et al. (2001) collected 75 stories from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s web site for children, and generated 650 questions for them manually, where each question was answered by a sentence in the text. Leidner et al. (2003) both enriched the CBC4kids data by adding several layers of annotation (such as semantic and POS tags), and measured QA performance as a function of question difficulty. For a further compendium of resources related to the story comprehension task, see Mueller (2010). The task proposed here differs from the above work in several ways. Most importantly, the data collection is scalable: if the dataset proves sufficiently useful to others, it would be straightforward to gather an order of magnitude more. Even the dataset size presented here is an order of magnitude larger than the Remedia or the CBC4kids data and many times larger than QA4MRE. Second, the multiple choice task presents less ambiguity (and is consequently easier to collect data for) than the ly from MC500 train set). task of finding the most appropriate sentence, and may be automatically evaluated. Further, our stories are fictional, which means that the information to answer the question is contained only in the story itself (as opposed to being able to directly leverage knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia). 195 This design was chosen to focus the task on the machine understanding of short passages, rather than the ability to match against an existing knowledge base. In addition, while in the CBC4kids data each answer was a sentence from the story, here we required that approximately half of the questions require at least two sentences from the text to answer; being able to control complexity in this way is a further benefit of using multiple choice answers. Finally, as explained in Section 1, the use of free-form input makes the problem open domain (as opposed to the ATIS, Geoquery and Jobs data), leading to the hope that solutions to the task presented here will be easier to apply to novel, unrelated tasks. 3 Generating the Stories and Questions Our aim was to generate a corpus of fictional story that could be scaled with as little expert input as possible. Thus, we designed the process to be gated by cost, and keeping the costs low was a high priority. Crowd-sourcing seemed particularly appropriate, given the nature of the task, so we opted to use Amazon Mechanical Turk2 (AMT). With over 500,000 workers3, it provides the work sets1 force required to both achieve scalability and, equally importantly, to provide diversity in the stories and types of questions. We restricted our task to AMT workers (workers) residing in the United States. The average worker is 36 years old, more educated than the United States population in general (Paolacci et al., 2010), and the majority of workers are female. 3.1 The Story and Questions Workers were instructed to write a short (150-300 words) fictional story, and to write as if for a child in grade school. The choice of 150-300 was made to keep the task an appropriate size for workers while still allowing for complex stories and questions. The workers were free to write about any topic they desired (as long as it was appropriate for a young child), and so there is a wide range, including vacations, animals, school, cars, eating, gardening, fairy tales, spaceships, and cowboys. 1 We use the term “story set” to denote the fictional story together with its multiple choice questions, hypothetical answers, and correct answer labels. 2 http://www.mturk.com 3 https://requester.mturk.com/tour Workers were also asked to provide four reading comprehension questions pertaining to their story and, for each, four multiple-choice answers. Coming up with incorrect alternatives (distractors) is a difficult task (see, e.g., Agarwal, 2011) but workers were requested to provide “reasonable” incorrect answers that at least include words from the story so that their solution is not trivial. For example, for the question “What is the name of the dog?”, if only one of the four answers occurs in the story, then that answer must be the correct one. Finally, workers were asked to design their questions and answers such that at least two of the four questions required multiple sentences from the story to answer them. That is, for those questions it should not be possible to find the answer in any individual sentence. The motivation for this was to ensure that the task could not be fully solved using lexical techniques, such as word matching, alone. Whilst it is still possible that a sophisticated lexical analysis could completely solve the task, requiring that answers be constructed from at least two different sentences in the story makes this much less likely; our hope is that the solution will instead require some inference and some form of limited reasoning. This hope rests in part upon the observation that standardized reading comprehension tests, whose goal after all is to test comprehension, generally avoid questions that can be answered by reading a single sentence. 3.2 Automatic Validation Besides verifying that the story and all of the questions and answers were provided, we performed the following automatic validation before allowing the worker to complete the task: Limited vocabulary: The lowercase words in the story, questions, and answers were stemmed and checked against a vocabulary list of approximately 8000 words that a 7-year old is likely to know (Kuperman et al., 2012). Any words not on the list were highlighted in red as the worker typed, and the task could not be submitted unless all of the words satisfied this vocabulary criterion. To allow the use of arbitrary proper nouns, capitalized words were not checked against the vocabulary list. Multiple-sentence questions: As described earlier, we required that at least two of the questions need multiple sentences to answer. Workers were simply asked to mark whether a question needs one 196 or multiple sentences and we required that at least two are marked as multiple. 3.3 The Workers Workers were required to reside in the United States and to have completed 100 HITs with an over 95% approval The median worker took 22 minutes to complete the task. We paid workers $2.50 per story set and allowed each to do a maximum of 8 tasks (5 in MC500). We did not experiment with paying less, but this rate amounts to $6.82/hour, which is approximately the rate paid by other writing tasks on AMT at the time, though is also significantly higher than the median wage of $1.38 found in 2010 (Horton and Chilton, 2010). Workers could optionally leave feedback on the task, which was overwhelmingly positive – the most frequent non-stopword in the comments was “fun” and the most frequent phrase was “thank you”. The only negative comments (in <1% of submissions) were when the worker felt that a particular word should have been on the allowed vocabulary list. Given the positive feedback, it may be possible to pay less if we collect more data in the future. We did not enforce story length constraints, but some workers interpreted our suggestion that the story be 150-300 words as a hard rate4. constraint, and some asked to be able to write a longer story. The MCTest corpus contains two sets of stories, named MC160 and MC500, and containing 160 and 500 stories respectively. MC160 was gathered first, then some improvements were made before gathering MC500. We give details on the differences between these two sets below. 3.4 MC160: Manually Curated for Quality In addition to the details described above, MC160 workers were given a target elementary grade school level (1-4) and a sample story matching that grade level5. The intent was to produce a set of stories and questions that varied in difficulty so that research work can progress grade-by-grade if needed. However, we found little difference between grades in the corpus.. After gathering the stories, we manually curated the MC160 corpus by reading each story set and 4 The latter two are the default AMT requirements. 5 From http://www.englishforeveryone.org/. correcting errors. The most common mistakes were grammatical, though occasionally questions and/or answers needed to be fixed. 66% of the stories have at least one correction. We provide both the curated and original corpuses in order to allow research on reading comprehension in the presence of grammar, spelling, and other mistakes. 3.5 MC500: Adding a Grammar Test Though the construction of MC160 was successful, it requires a costly curation process which will not scale to larger data sets (although the curation was useful, both for improving the design of MC500, and for assessing the effectiveness of automated curation techniques). To more fully automate the process, we added two more stages: (1) A grammar test that automatically pre-screens workers for writing ability, and (2) a second Mechanical Turk task whereby new workers take the reading comprehension tests and rate their quality. We will discuss stage (2) in the next section. The grammar test consisted of 20 sentences, half of which had one grammatical error (see Figure 2). The incorrect sentences were written using common errors such as you ’re vs. your, using ‘s to indicate plurality, incorrect use of tense, it’ ’s vs. its, 197 NGoGramram mar TreTsets Q(u134a-.52l3i) tyaAn73ib m0o% aults Table 1. Pre-screening workers using a grammar test improves both quality and diversity of stories. Both differences are significant using the two-tailed t-test (p<0.05 for quality and p<0.01 for animals). less vs. fewer, I me, etc. Workers were required vs. to indicate for each sentence whether it was grammatically correct or not, and had to pass with at least 80% accuracy in order to qualify for the task. The 80% threshold was chosen to trade off worker quality with the rate at which the tasks would be completed; initial experiments using a threshold of 90% indicated that collecting 500 stories would take many weeks instead of days. Note that each worker is allowed to write at most 5 stores, so we required at least 100 workers to pass the qualification test. To validate the use of the qualification test, we gathered 30 stories requiring the test (qual) and 30 stories without. We selected a random set of 20 stories (10 from each), hid their origin, and then graded the overall quality of the story and questions from 1-5, meaning do not attempt to fix, bad but rescuable, has non-minor problems, has only minor problems, and has no problems, respectively. Results are shown in Table 1. The difference is statistically significant (p<0.05, using the twotailed t-test). The qual stories were also more diverse, with fewer of them about animals (the most common topic). Additional Modifications: Based on our experience curating MC160, we also made the following modifications to the task. In order to eliminate trivially-answerable questions, we required that each answer be unique, and that either the correct answer did not appear in the story or, if it did appear, that at least two of the incorrect answers also appeared in the story. This is to prevent questions that are trivially answered by checking which answer appears in the story. The condition on whether the correct answer appears is to allow questions such as “How many candies did Susan eat?”, where the total may never appear in the story, even though the information needed to derive it does. An answer is considered to appear in the story if at least half (rounded down) of its non-stopword terms appear in the story (ignoring word endings). This check is done automatically and must be satisfied before the worker is able to complete the task. Workers could also bypass the check if they felt it was incorrect, by adding a special term to their answer. We were also concerned that the sample story might bias the workers when writing the story set, particularly when designing questions that require multiple sentences to answer. So, we removed the sample story and grade level from the task. Finally, in order to encourage more diversity of stories, we added creativity terms, a set of 15 nouns chosen at random from the allowed vocabulary set. Workers were asked to “please consider” using one or more of the terms in their story, but use of the words was strictly optional. On average, workers used 3.9 of the creativity terms in their stories. 4 Rating the Stories and Questions In this section we discuss the crowd-sourced rating of story sets. We wished to ensure story set quality despite the fact that MC500 was only minimally manually curated (see below). Pre-qualifying workers with a grammar test was one step of this process. The second step was to have additional workers on Mechanical Turk both evaluate each story and take its corresponding test. Each story was evaluated in this way by 10 workers, each of whom provided scores for each of ageappropriateness (yes/maybe/no), grammaticality (few/some/many errors), and story clarity (excellent/reasonable/poor). When answering the four reading comprehension questions, workers could also mark a question as “unclear”. Each story set was rated by 10 workers who were each paid $0. 15 per set. Since we know the purportedly correct answer, we can estimate worker quality by measuring what fraction of questions that worker got right. Workers with less than 80% accuracy (ignoring those questions marked as unclear) were removed from the set. This constituted just 4.1% of the raters and 4.2% of the judgments (see Figure 3). Only one rater appeared to be an intentional spammer, answering 1056 questions with only 29% accuracy. The others primarily judged only one story. Only one worker fell between, answering 336 questions with just 75% accuracy. 198 Figure 3. Just 4.1% of raters had an accuracy below 80% (constituting 4.2% of the judgments). For the remaining workers (those who achieved at least 80% accuracy), we measured median story appropriateness, grammar, and clarity. For each category, stories for which less than half of the ratings were the best possible (e.g., excellent story clarity) were inspected and optionally removed from the data set. This required inspecting 40 (<10%) of the stories, only 2 of which were deemed poor enough to be removed (both of which had over half of the ratings all the way at the bot- tom end of the scale, indicating we could potentially have inspected many fewer stories with the same results). We also inspected questions for which at least 5 workers answered incorrectly, or answered “unclear”. In total, 29 questions (<2%) were inspected. 5 were fixed by changing the question, 8 by changing the answers, 2 by changing both, 6 by changing the story, and 8 were left unmodified. Note that while not fully automated, this process of inspecting stories and repairing questions took one person one day, so is still scalable to at least an order of magnitude more stories. 5 Dataset Analysis In Table 2, we present results demonstrating the value of the grammar test and curation process. As expected, manually curating MC160 resulted in increased grammar quality and percent of questions answered correctly by raters. The goal of MC500 was to find a more scalable method to achieve the same quality as the curated MC160. As Table 2 shows, the grammar test improved story grammar quality from 1.70 to 1.77 (both uncurated). The rating and one-day curation process in- TS51a06bet0l cu2r.ateAdvra1 Ag.9e8241aAgpe1 Cp.67la13r57oiptyrae1 Gn.7er8a90s74mǂ, satroy9C 567oc.lr397a eritcy, grammar quality (0-2, with 2 being best), and percent of questions answered correctly by raters, for the original and curated versions of the data.

Curation also improved the percent of questions answered correctly for both MC160 and MC500, but, unlike with grammar, there is no significant difference between the two curated sets. Indeed, the only statis- tically significant difference between the two is in grammar. So, the MC500 grammar test and curation process is a very scalable method for collecting stories of nearly the quality of the costly manual curation of MC160. We also computed correlations between these measures of quality and various factors such as story length and time spent writing the story. On MC500, there is a mild correlation between a worker’s grammar test score and the judged grammar quality of that worker’s story (correlation of 0.24). Interestingly, this relation disappeared once MC500 was curated, likely due to repairing the stories with the worst grammar. On MC160, there is a mild correlation between the clarity and the number of words in the question and answer (0.20 and 0.18). All other correlations were below 0. 15. These factors could be integrated into an estimate for age-appropriateness, clarity, and grammar, potentially reducing the need for raters. Table 3 provides statistics on each corpus. MC160 and MC500 are similar in average number of words per story, question, and answer, as well as the median writing time.

We randomly divided MC160 and MC500 into train, development, and test sets of 70, 30, and 60 stories and 300, 50, and 150 stories, respectively. 6 Baseline System and Results We wrote two baseline systems, both using only simple lexical features. The first system used a sliding window, matching a bag of words constructed from the question and hypothesized answer to the text. Since this ignored long range dependencies, we added a second, word-distance based algorithm. The distance-based score was simply subtracted from the window-based score to arrive at the final score (we tried scaling the distance score before subtraction but this did not improve results on the MC160 train set). The algorithms are summarized in Figure 4. A coin flip is used to break ties. The use of inverse word counts was inspired by TF-IDF. Results for MC160 and MC500 are shown in Table 4 and Table 5. The MC160 train and development sets were used for tuning. The baseline algorithm was authored without seeing any portion of MC500, so both the MC160 test set and all of 200 BRCoaTsmEelbin e d(SW+D)65 M967C. 76219506ǂ 0Test5 6M603C. 685 7320ǂ 0Test Table 6. Percent correct for MC160 and MC500 test sets. The ǂ indicates statistical significance vs. baseline (p<0.01 using the two-tailed paired t-test). MC160 combined vs. baseline has p-value 0.063. MC500 were used for testing (although we nevertheless report results on the train/test split). Note that adding the distance based algorithm improved accuracy by approximately 10% absolute on MC160 and approximately 6% on MC500. Overall, error rates on MC500 are higher than on MC160, which agrees with human performance (see Table 2), suggesting that MC500’s questions are more difficult. 7 Recognizing Textual Entailment Results We also tried using a “recognizing textual entailment” (RTE) system to answer MCTest questions. The goal of RTE (Dagan et al., 2005) is to determine whether a given statement can be inferred from a particular text. We can cast MCTest as an RTE task by converting each question-answer pair into a statement, and then selecting the answer whose statement has the highest likelihood of being entailed by the story. For example, in the sample story given in Figure 1, the second question can be converted into four statements (one for each answer), and the RTE system should select the statement “James pulled pudding off of the shelves in the grocery store” as the most likely one. For converting question-answer pairs to statements, we used the rules employed in a web-based question answering system (Cucerzan and Agichtein, 2005). For RTE, we used BIUTEE (Stern and Dagan, 2011), which performs better than the median system in the past four RTE competitions. We ran BIUTEE both in its default configuration, as well as with its optional additional data sources (FrameNet, ReVerb, DIRT, and others as found on the BIUTEE home page). The default configuration performed better so we present its results here. The results in Table 6 show that the RTE method performed worse than the baseline. We also combined the baseline and RTE system by training BIUTEE on the train set and using the development set to optimize a linear combination of BIUTEE with the baseline; the combined system outperforms either component system on MC500. It is possible that with some tuning, an RTE system will outperform our baseline system. Nevertheless, these RTE results, and the performance of the baseline system, both suggest that the reading comprehension task described here will not be trivially solved by off-the-shelf techniques. 8 Making Data and Results an Ongoing Resource Our goal in constructing this data is to encourage research and innovation in the machine comprehension of text. Thus, we have made both MC160 and MC500 freely available for download at http://research.microsoft.com/mct. To our knowledge, these are the largest copyright-free reading comprehension data sets publicly available. To further encourage research on these data, we will be continually updating the webpage with the bestknown published results to date, along with pointers to those publications. One of the difficulties in making progress on a particular task is implementing previous work in order to apply improvements to it. To mitigate this difficulty, we are encouraging researchers who use the data to (optionally) provide per-answer scores from their system. Doing so has three benefits: (a) a new system can be measured in the context of the errors made by the previous systems, allowing each research effort to incrementally add useful functionality without needing to also re-implement the current state-of-the-art; (b) it allows system performance to be measured using paired statistical testing, which will substantially increase the ability to determine whether small improvements are significant; and (c) it enables researchers to perform error analysis on any of the existing systems, simplifying the process of identifying and tackling common sources of error. We will also periodically ensemble the known systems using standard machine learning techniques and make those results available as well (unless the existing state-of-theart already does such ensembling). The released data contains the stories and questions, as well as the results from workers who rated 201 the stories and took the tests. The latter may be used, for example, to measure machine performance vs. human performance on a per-question basis (i.e., does your algorithm make similar mistakes to humans?), or vs. the judged clarity of each story. The ratings, as well as whether a question needs multiple sentences to answer, should typically only be used in evaluation, since such information is not generally available for most text. We will also provide an anonymized author id for each story, which could allow additional research such as using other works by the same author when understanding a story, or research on authorship attribution (e.g., Stamatatos, 2009). 9 Future Work We plan to use this dataset to evaluate approaches for machine comprehension, but are making it available now so that others may do the same. If MCTest is used we will collect more story sets and will continue to refine the collection process. One interesting research direction is ensuring that the questions are difficult enough to challenge state-ofthe-art techniques as they develop. One idea for this is to apply existing techniques automatically during story set creation to see whether a question is too easily answered by a machine. By requiring authors to create difficult questions, each data set will be made more and more difficult (but still answerable by humans) as the state-of-the-art methods advance. We will also experiment with timing the raters as they answer questions to see if we can find those that are too easy for people to answer. Removing such questions may increase the difficulty for machines as well. Additionally, any divergence between how easily a person answers a question vs. how easily a machine does may point toward new techniques for improving machine comprehension; we plan to conduct research in this direction as well as make any such data available for others. 10 Conclusion We present the MCTest dataset in the hope that it will help spur research into the machine comprehension of text. The metric (the accuracy on the question sets) is clearly defined, and on that metric, lexical baseline algorithms only attain approximately 58% correct on test data (the MC500 set) as opposed to the 100% correct that the majority of crowd-sourced judges attain. A key component of MCTest is the scalable design: we have shown that data whose quality approaches that of expertly cu- rated data can be generated using crowd sourcing coupled with expert correction of worker-identified errors. Should MCTest prove useful to the community, we will continue to gather data, both to increase the corpus size, and to keep the test sets fresh. The data is available at http://research.microsoft.com/mct and any submitted results will be posted there too. Because submissions will be requested to include the score for each test item, researchers will easily be able to compare their systems with those of others, and investigation of ensembles comprised of components from several different teams will be straightforward. MCTest also contains supplementary material that researchers may find useful, such as worker accuracies on a grammar test and crowd-sourced measures of the quality of their stories.

<p>Author: Desmond Elliott ; Frank Keller</p><p>Abstract: Describing the main event of an image involves identifying the objects depicted and predicting the relationships between them. Previous approaches have represented images as unstructured bags of regions, which makes it difficult to accurately predict meaningful relationships between regions. In this paper, we introduce visual dependency representations to capture the relationships between the objects in an image, and hypothesize that this representation can improve image description. We test this hypothesis using a new data set of region-annotated images, associated with visual dependency representations and gold-standard descriptions. We describe two template-based description generation models that operate over visual dependency representations. In an image descrip- tion task, we find that these models outperform approaches that rely on object proximity or corpus information to generate descriptions on both automatic measures and on human judgements.</p><p>5 0.11147287 <a title="179-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Event-Based_Time_Label_Propagation_for_Automatic_Dating_of_News_Articles.html">74 emnlp-2013-Event-Based Time Label Propagation for Automatic Dating of News Articles</a></p>
<p>Author: Tao Ge ; Baobao Chang ; Sujian Li ; Zhifang Sui</p><p>Abstract: Since many applications such as timeline summaries and temporal IR involving temporal analysis rely on document timestamps, the task of automatic dating of documents has been increasingly important. Instead of using feature-based methods as conventional models, our method attempts to date documents in a year level by exploiting relative temporal relations between documents and events, which are very effective for dating documents. Based on this intuition, we proposed an eventbased time label propagation model called confidence boosting in which time label information can be propagated between documents and events on a bipartite graph. The experiments show that our event-based propagation model can predict document timestamps in high accuracy and the model combined with a MaxEnt classifier outperforms the state-ofthe-art method for this task especially when the size of the training set is small.</p><p>6 0.102464 <a title="179-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Multimodal_LDA_Model_integrating_Textual%2C_Cognitive_and_Visual_Modalities.html">11 emnlp-2013-A Multimodal LDA Model integrating Textual, Cognitive and Visual Modalities</a></p>

<p>Author: Shize Xu ; Shanshan Wang ; Yan Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The rapid development of Web2.0 leads to significant information redundancy. Especially for a complex news event, it is difficult to understand its general idea within a single coherent picture. A complex event often contains branches, intertwining narratives and side news which are all called storylines. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to tackle the challenging problem of storylines extraction and reconstruction. Specifically, we first investigate two requisite properties of an ideal storyline. Then a unified algorithm is devised to extract all effective storylines by optimizing these properties at the same time. Finally, we reconstruct all extracted lines and generate the high-quality story map. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method is quite efficient and highly competitive, which can bring about quicker, clearer and deeper comprehension to readers.</p><p>2 0.81820929 <a title="179-lsi-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Optimized_Event_Storyline_Generation_based_on_Mixture-Event-Aspect_Model.html">147 emnlp-2013-Optimized Event Storyline Generation based on Mixture-Event-Aspect Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Lifu Huang ; Lian'en Huang</p><p>Abstract: Recently, much research focuses on event storyline generation, which aims to produce a concise, global and temporal event summary from a collection of articles. Generally, each event contains multiple sub-events and the storyline should be composed by the component summaries of all the sub-events. However, different sub-events have different part-whole relationship with the major event, which is important to correspond to users’ interests but seldom considered in previous work. To distinguish different types of sub-events, we propose a mixture-event-aspect model which models different sub-events into local and global aspects. Combining these local/global aspects with summarization requirements together, we utilize an optimization method to generate the component summaries along the timeline. We develop experimental systems on 6 distinctively different datasets. Evaluation and comparison results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p><p>3 0.4778218 <a title="179-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-MCTest%3A_A_Challenge_Dataset_for_the_Open-Domain_Machine_Comprehension_of_Text.html">126 emnlp-2013-MCTest: A Challenge Dataset for the Open-Domain Machine Comprehension of Text</a></p>

Previous work on machine comprehension (e.g., semantic modeling) has made great strides, but primarily focuses either on limited-domain datasets, or on solving a more restricted goal (e.g., open-domain relation extraction). In contrast, MCTest requires machines to answer multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about fictional stories, directly tackling the high-level goal of open-domain machine comprehension. Reading comprehension can test advanced abilities such as causal reasoning and understanding the world, yet, by being multiple-choice, still provide a clear metric. By being fictional, the answer typically can be found only in the story itself. The stories and questions are also carefully limited to those a young child would understand, reducing the world knowledge that is required for the task. We present the scalable crowd-sourcing methods that allow us to cheaply construct a dataset of 500 stories and 2000 questions. By screening workers (with grammar tests) and stories (with grading), we have ensured that the data is the same quality as another set that we manually edited, but at one tenth the editing cost. By being open-domain, yet carefully restricted, we hope MCTest will serve to encourage research and provide a clear metric for advancement on the machine comprehension of text. 1 Reading Comprehension A major goal for NLP is for machines to be able to understand text as well as people. Several research 193 semantic role labeling, and recognizing textual entailment. Yet these techniques are necessarily evaluated individually, rather than by how much they advance us towards the end goal. On the other hand, the goal of semantic parsing is the machine comprehension of text (MCT), yet its evaluation requires adherence to a specific knowledge representation, and it is currently unclear what the best representation is, for open-domain text. We believe that it is useful to directly tackle the top-level task of MCT. For this, we need a way to measure progress. One common method for evaluating someone’s understanding of text is by giving them a multiple-choice reading comprehension test. This has the advantage that it is objectively gradable (vs. essays) yet may test a range of abilities such as causal or counterfactual reasoning, inference among relations, or just basic understanding of the world in which the passage is set. Therefore, we propose a multiple-choice reading comprehension task as a way to evaluate progress on MCT. We have built a reading comprehension dataset containing 500 fictional stories, with 4 multiple choice questions per story. It was built using methods which can easily scale to at least 5000 stories, since the stories were created, and the curation was done, using crowd sourcing almost entirely, at a total of $4.00 per story. We plan to periodically update the dataset to ensure that methods are not overfitting to the existing data. The dataset is open-domain, yet restricted to concepts and words that a 7 year old is expected to understand. This task is still beyond the capability of today’s computers and algorithms.

The multiple choice task avoids ambiguities (such as when the task is to find a sentence that best matches a question, as in some early reading comprehension tasks: see Section 2), and also avoids the need for additional grading, such as is needed in some TREC tasks. The stories were chosen to be fictional to focus work on finding the answer in the story itself, rather than in knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia; the goal is to build technology that actually understands stories and paragraphs on a deep level (as opposed to using information retrieval methods and the redundancy of the web to find the answers). We chose to use crowd sourcing, as opposed to, for example, contracting teachers or paying for existing standardized tests, for three reasons, namely: (1) scalability, both for the sizes of datasets we can provide, and also for the ease of regularly refreshing the data; (2) for the variety in story-telling that having many different authors brings; and (3) for the free availability that can only result from providing non-copyrighted data. The content is freely available at http://research.microsoft.com/mct, and we plan to use that site to track published results and provide other resources, such as labels of various kinds. 2 Previous Work The research goal of mapping text to meaning representations in order to solve particular tasks has a long history. DARPA introduced the Airline Travel Information System (ATIS) in the early 90’s: there the task was to slot-fill flight-related information by modeling the intent of spoken language (see Tur et al., 2010, for a review). This data continues to be a used in the semantic modeling community (see, for example, Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2009). The Geoquery database contains 880 geographical facts about the US and has played a similar role for written (as opposed to spoken) natural language queries against a database (Zelle and Mooney, 1996) and it also continues to spur research (see for example Goldwasser et al., 2011), as does the similar Jobs database, which provides mappings of 640 sentences to a listing of jobs 194 (Tang and Mooney, 2001). More recently, Zweig and Burges (2012) provided a set of 1040 sentences that comprise an SAT-style multiple choice sentence completion task. The idea of using story-based reading comprehension questions to evaluate methods for machine reading itself goes back over a decade, when Hirschmann et al. (1999) showed that a bag of words approach, together with some heuristic linguistic modeling, could achieve 40% accuracy for the task of picking the sentence that best matches the query for “who / what / when / where / why” questions, on a small reading comprehension dataset from Remedia. This dataset spurred several research efforts, for example using reinforcement learning (Grois and Wilkins, 2005), named entity resolution (Harabagiu et al., 2003) and mapping questions and answers to logical form (Wellner et al., 2006). Work on story understanding itself goes back much further, to 1972, when Charniak proposed using a background model to answer questions about children’s stories. Similarly, the TREC (and TAC) Question Answering tracks (e.g., Voorhees and Tice, 1999) aim to evaluate systems on their ability to answer factual questions such as “Where is the Taj Mahal”. The QA4MRE task also aims to evaluate machine reading systems through question answering (e.g., Clark et al., 2012). Earlier work has also aimed at controlling the scope by limiting the text to children’s stories: Breck et al. (2001) collected 75 stories from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s web site for children, and generated 650 questions for them manually, where each question was answered by a sentence in the text. Leidner et al. (2003) both enriched the CBC4kids data by adding several layers of annotation (such as semantic and POS tags), and measured QA performance as a function of question difficulty. For a further compendium of resources related to the story comprehension task, see Mueller (2010). The task proposed here differs from the above work in several ways. Most importantly, the data collection is scalable: if the dataset proves sufficiently useful to others, it would be straightforward to gather an order of magnitude more. Even the dataset size presented here is an order of magnitude larger than the Remedia or the CBC4kids data and many times larger than QA4MRE. Second, the multiple choice task presents less ambiguity (and is consequently easier to collect data for) than the ly from MC500 train set). task of finding the most appropriate sentence, and may be automatically evaluated. Further, our stories are fictional, which means that the information to answer the question is contained only in the story itself (as opposed to being able to directly leverage knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia). 195 This design was chosen to focus the task on the machine understanding of short passages, rather than the ability to match against an existing knowledge base. In addition, while in the CBC4kids data each answer was a sentence from the story, here we required that approximately half of the questions require at least two sentences from the text to answer; being able to control complexity in this way is a further benefit of using multiple choice answers. Finally, as explained in Section 1, the use of free-form input makes the problem open domain (as opposed to the ATIS, Geoquery and Jobs data), leading to the hope that solutions to the task presented here will be easier to apply to novel, unrelated tasks. 3 Generating the Stories and Questions Our aim was to generate a corpus of fictional story that could be scaled with as little expert input as possible. Thus, we designed the process to be gated by cost, and keeping the costs low was a high priority. Crowd-sourcing seemed particularly appropriate, given the nature of the task, so we opted to use Amazon Mechanical Turk2 (AMT). With over 500,000 workers3, it provides the work sets1 force required to both achieve scalability and, equally importantly, to provide diversity in the stories and types of questions. We restricted our task to AMT workers (workers) residing in the United States. The average worker is 36 years old, more educated than the United States population in general (Paolacci et al., 2010), and the majority of workers are female. 3.1 The Story and Questions Workers were instructed to write a short (150-300 words) fictional story, and to write as if for a child in grade school. The choice of 150-300 was made to keep the task an appropriate size for workers while still allowing for complex stories and questions. The workers were free to write about any topic they desired (as long as it was appropriate for a young child), and so there is a wide range, including vacations, animals, school, cars, eating, gardening, fairy tales, spaceships, and cowboys. 1 We use the term “story set” to denote the fictional story together with its multiple choice questions, hypothetical answers, and correct answer labels. 2 http://www.mturk.com 3 https://requester.mturk.com/tour Workers were also asked to provide four reading comprehension questions pertaining to their story and, for each, four multiple-choice answers. Coming up with incorrect alternatives (distractors) is a difficult task (see, e.g., Agarwal, 2011) but workers were requested to provide “reasonable” incorrect answers that at least include words from the story so that their solution is not trivial. For example, for the question “What is the name of the dog?”, if only one of the four answers occurs in the story, then that answer must be the correct one. Finally, workers were asked to design their questions and answers such that at least two of the four questions required multiple sentences from the story to answer them. That is, for those questions it should not be possible to find the answer in any individual sentence. The motivation for this was to ensure that the task could not be fully solved using lexical techniques, such as word matching, alone. Whilst it is still possible that a sophisticated lexical analysis could completely solve the task, requiring that answers be constructed from at least two different sentences in the story makes this much less likely; our hope is that the solution will instead require some inference and some form of limited reasoning. This hope rests in part upon the observation that standardized reading comprehension tests, whose goal after all is to test comprehension, generally avoid questions that can be answered by reading a single sentence. 3.2 Automatic Validation Besides verifying that the story and all of the questions and answers were provided, we performed the following automatic validation before allowing the worker to complete the task: Limited vocabulary: The lowercase words in the story, questions, and answers were stemmed and checked against a vocabulary list of approximately 8000 words that a 7-year old is likely to know (Kuperman et al., 2012). Any words not on the list were highlighted in red as the worker typed, and the task could not be submitted unless all of the words satisfied this vocabulary criterion. To allow the use of arbitrary proper nouns, capitalized words were not checked against the vocabulary list. Multiple-sentence questions: As described earlier, we required that at least two of the questions need multiple sentences to answer. Workers were simply asked to mark whether a question needs one 196 or multiple sentences and we required that at least two are marked as multiple. 3.3 The Workers Workers were required to reside in the United States and to have completed 100 HITs with an over 95% approval The median worker took 22 minutes to complete the task. We paid workers $2.50 per story set and allowed each to do a maximum of 8 tasks (5 in MC500). We did not experiment with paying less, but this rate amounts to $6.82/hour, which is approximately the rate paid by other writing tasks on AMT at the time, though is also significantly higher than the median wage of $1.38 found in 2010 (Horton and Chilton, 2010). Workers could optionally leave feedback on the task, which was overwhelmingly positive – the most frequent non-stopword in the comments was “fun” and the most frequent phrase was “thank you”. The only negative comments (in <1% of submissions) were when the worker felt that a particular word should have been on the allowed vocabulary list. Given the positive feedback, it may be possible to pay less if we collect more data in the future. We did not enforce story length constraints, but some workers interpreted our suggestion that the story be 150-300 words as a hard rate4. constraint, and some asked to be able to write a longer story. The MCTest corpus contains two sets of stories, named MC160 and MC500, and containing 160 and 500 stories respectively. MC160 was gathered first, then some improvements were made before gathering MC500. We give details on the differences between these two sets below. 3.4 MC160: Manually Curated for Quality In addition to the details described above, MC160 workers were given a target elementary grade school level (1-4) and a sample story matching that grade level5. The intent was to produce a set of stories and questions that varied in difficulty so that research work can progress grade-by-grade if needed. However, we found little difference between grades in the corpus.. After gathering the stories, we manually curated the MC160 corpus by reading each story set and 4 The latter two are the default AMT requirements. 5 From http://www.englishforeveryone.org/. correcting errors. The most common mistakes were grammatical, though occasionally questions and/or answers needed to be fixed. 66% of the stories have at least one correction. We provide both the curated and original corpuses in order to allow research on reading comprehension in the presence of grammar, spelling, and other mistakes. 3.5 MC500: Adding a Grammar Test Though the construction of MC160 was successful, it requires a costly curation process which will not scale to larger data sets (although the curation was useful, both for improving the design of MC500, and for assessing the effectiveness of automated curation techniques). To more fully automate the process, we added two more stages: (1) A grammar test that automatically pre-screens workers for writing ability, and (2) a second Mechanical Turk task whereby new workers take the reading comprehension tests and rate their quality. We will discuss stage (2) in the next section. The grammar test consisted of 20 sentences, half of which had one grammatical error (see Figure 2). The incorrect sentences were written using common errors such as you ’re vs. your, using ‘s to indicate plurality, incorrect use of tense, it’ ’s vs. its, 197 NGoGramram mar TreTsets Q(u134a-.52l3i) tyaAn73ib m0o% aults Table 1. Pre-screening workers using a grammar test improves both quality and diversity of stories. Both differences are significant using the two-tailed t-test (p<0.05 for quality and p<0.01 for animals). less vs. fewer, I me, etc. Workers were required vs. to indicate for each sentence whether it was grammatically correct or not, and had to pass with at least 80% accuracy in order to qualify for the task. The 80% threshold was chosen to trade off worker quality with the rate at which the tasks would be completed; initial experiments using a threshold of 90% indicated that collecting 500 stories would take many weeks instead of days. Note that each worker is allowed to write at most 5 stores, so we required at least 100 workers to pass the qualification test. To validate the use of the qualification test, we gathered 30 stories requiring the test (qual) and 30 stories without. We selected a random set of 20 stories (10 from each), hid their origin, and then graded the overall quality of the story and questions from 1-5, meaning do not attempt to fix, bad but rescuable, has non-minor problems, has only minor problems, and has no problems, respectively. Results are shown in Table 1. The difference is statistically significant (p<0.05, using the twotailed t-test). The qual stories were also more diverse, with fewer of them about animals (the most common topic). Additional Modifications: Based on our experience curating MC160, we also made the following modifications to the task. In order to eliminate trivially-answerable questions, we required that each answer be unique, and that either the correct answer did not appear in the story or, if it did appear, that at least two of the incorrect answers also appeared in the story. This is to prevent questions that are trivially answered by checking which answer appears in the story. The condition on whether the correct answer appears is to allow questions such as “How many candies did Susan eat?”, where the total may never appear in the story, even though the information needed to derive it does. An answer is considered to appear in the story if at least half (rounded down) of its non-stopword terms appear in the story (ignoring word endings). This check is done automatically and must be satisfied before the worker is able to complete the task. Workers could also bypass the check if they felt it was incorrect, by adding a special term to their answer. We were also concerned that the sample story might bias the workers when writing the story set, particularly when designing questions that require multiple sentences to answer. So, we removed the sample story and grade level from the task. Finally, in order to encourage more diversity of stories, we added creativity terms, a set of 15 nouns chosen at random from the allowed vocabulary set. Workers were asked to “please consider” using one or more of the terms in their story, but use of the words was strictly optional. On average, workers used 3.9 of the creativity terms in their stories. 4 Rating the Stories and Questions In this section we discuss the crowd-sourced rating of story sets. We wished to ensure story set quality despite the fact that MC500 was only minimally manually curated (see below). Pre-qualifying workers with a grammar test was one step of this process. The second step was to have additional workers on Mechanical Turk both evaluate each story and take its corresponding test. Each story was evaluated in this way by 10 workers, each of whom provided scores for each of ageappropriateness (yes/maybe/no), grammaticality (few/some/many errors), and story clarity (excellent/reasonable/poor). When answering the four reading comprehension questions, workers could also mark a question as “unclear”. Each story set was rated by 10 workers who were each paid $0. 15 per set. Since we know the purportedly correct answer, we can estimate worker quality by measuring what fraction of questions that worker got right. Workers with less than 80% accuracy (ignoring those questions marked as unclear) were removed from the set. This constituted just 4.1% of the raters and 4.2% of the judgments (see Figure 3). Only one rater appeared to be an intentional spammer, answering 1056 questions with only 29% accuracy. The others primarily judged only one story. Only one worker fell between, answering 336 questions with just 75% accuracy. 198 Figure 3. Just 4.1% of raters had an accuracy below 80% (constituting 4.2% of the judgments). For the remaining workers (those who achieved at least 80% accuracy), we measured median story appropriateness, grammar, and clarity. For each category, stories for which less than half of the ratings were the best possible (e.g., excellent story clarity) were inspected and optionally removed from the data set. This required inspecting 40 (<10%) of the stories, only 2 of which were deemed poor enough to be removed (both of which had over half of the ratings all the way at the bot- tom end of the scale, indicating we could potentially have inspected many fewer stories with the same results). We also inspected questions for which at least 5 workers answered incorrectly, or answered “unclear”. In total, 29 questions (<2%) were inspected. 5 were fixed by changing the question, 8 by changing the answers, 2 by changing both, 6 by changing the story, and 8 were left unmodified. Note that while not fully automated, this process of inspecting stories and repairing questions took one person one day, so is still scalable to at least an order of magnitude more stories. 5 Dataset Analysis In Table 2, we present results demonstrating the value of the grammar test and curation process. As expected, manually curating MC160 resulted in increased grammar quality and percent of questions answered correctly by raters. The goal of MC500 was to find a more scalable method to achieve the same quality as the curated MC160. As Table 2 shows, the grammar test improved story grammar quality from 1.70 to 1.77 (both uncurated). The rating and one-day curation process in- TS51a06bet0l cu2r.ateAdvra1 Ag.9e8241aAgpe1 Cp.67la13r57oiptyrae1 Gn.7er8a90s74mǂ, satroy9C 567oc.lr397a eritcy, grammar quality (0-2, with 2 being best), and percent of questions answered correctly by raters, for the original and curated versions of the data.

Curation also improved the percent of questions answered correctly for both MC160 and MC500, but, unlike with grammar, there is no significant difference between the two curated sets. Indeed, the only statis- tically significant difference between the two is in grammar. So, the MC500 grammar test and curation process is a very scalable method for collecting stories of nearly the quality of the costly manual curation of MC160. We also computed correlations between these measures of quality and various factors such as story length and time spent writing the story. On MC500, there is a mild correlation between a worker’s grammar test score and the judged grammar quality of that worker’s story (correlation of 0.24). Interestingly, this relation disappeared once MC500 was curated, likely due to repairing the stories with the worst grammar. On MC160, there is a mild correlation between the clarity and the number of words in the question and answer (0.20 and 0.18). All other correlations were below 0. 15. These factors could be integrated into an estimate for age-appropriateness, clarity, and grammar, potentially reducing the need for raters. Table 3 provides statistics on each corpus. MC160 and MC500 are similar in average number of words per story, question, and answer, as well as the median writing time.

All differences between SW and SW+D are significant (p<0.01, tested as above). We randomly divided MC160 and MC500 into train, development, and test sets of 70, 30, and 60 stories and 300, 50, and 150 stories, respectively. 6 Baseline System and Results We wrote two baseline systems, both using only simple lexical features. The first system used a sliding window, matching a bag of words constructed from the question and hypothesized answer to the text. Since this ignored long range dependencies, we added a second, word-distance based algorithm. The distance-based score was simply subtracted from the window-based score to arrive at the final score (we tried scaling the distance score before subtraction but this did not improve results on the MC160 train set). The algorithms are summarized in Figure 4. A coin flip is used to break ties. The use of inverse word counts was inspired by TF-IDF. Results for MC160 and MC500 are shown in Table 4 and Table 5. The MC160 train and development sets were used for tuning. The baseline algorithm was authored without seeing any portion of MC500, so both the MC160 test set and all of 200 BRCoaTsmEelbin e d(SW+D)65 M967C. 76219506ǂ 0Test5 6M603C. 685 7320ǂ 0Test Table 6.

MC500 were used for testing (although we nevertheless report results on the train/test split). Note that adding the distance based algorithm improved accuracy by approximately 10% absolute on MC160 and approximately 6% on MC500. Overall, error rates on MC500 are higher than on MC160, which agrees with human performance (see Table 2), suggesting that MC500’s questions are more difficult. 7 Recognizing Textual Entailment Results We also tried using a “recognizing textual entailment” (RTE) system to answer MCTest questions. The goal of RTE (Dagan et al., 2005) is to determine whether a given statement can be inferred from a particular text. We can cast MCTest as an RTE task by converting each question-answer pair into a statement, and then selecting the answer whose statement has the highest likelihood of being entailed by the story. For example, in the sample story given in Figure 1, the second question can be converted into four statements (one for each answer), and the RTE system should select the statement “James pulled pudding off of the shelves in the grocery store” as the most likely one. For converting question-answer pairs to statements, we used the rules employed in a web-based question answering system (Cucerzan and Agichtein, 2005). For RTE, we used BIUTEE (Stern and Dagan, 2011), which performs better than the median system in the past four RTE competitions. We ran BIUTEE both in its default configuration, as well as with its optional additional data sources (FrameNet, ReVerb, DIRT, and others as found on the BIUTEE home page). The default configuration performed better so we present its results here. The results in Table 6 show that the RTE method performed worse than the baseline. We also combined the baseline and RTE system by training BIUTEE on the train set and using the development set to optimize a linear combination of BIUTEE with the baseline; the combined system outperforms either component system on MC500. It is possible that with some tuning, an RTE system will outperform our baseline system. Nevertheless, these RTE results, and the performance of the baseline system, both suggest that the reading comprehension task described here will not be trivially solved by off-the-shelf techniques. 8 Making Data and Results an Ongoing Resource Our goal in constructing this data is to encourage research and innovation in the machine comprehension of text. Thus, we have made both MC160 and MC500 freely available for download at http://research.microsoft.com/mct. To our knowledge, these are the largest copyright-free reading comprehension data sets publicly available. To further encourage research on these data, we will be continually updating the webpage with the bestknown published results to date, along with pointers to those publications. One of the difficulties in making progress on a particular task is implementing previous work in order to apply improvements to it. To mitigate this difficulty, we are encouraging researchers who use the data to (optionally) provide per-answer scores from their system. Doing so has three benefits: (a) a new system can be measured in the context of the errors made by the previous systems, allowing each research effort to incrementally add useful functionality without needing to also re-implement the current state-of-the-art; (b) it allows system performance to be measured using paired statistical testing, which will substantially increase the ability to determine whether small improvements are significant; and (c) it enables researchers to perform error analysis on any of the existing systems, simplifying the process of identifying and tackling common sources of error. We will also periodically ensemble the known systems using standard machine learning techniques and make those results available as well (unless the existing state-of-theart already does such ensembling). The released data contains the stories and questions, as well as the results from workers who rated 201 the stories and took the tests. The latter may be used, for example, to measure machine performance vs. human performance on a per-question basis (i.e., does your algorithm make similar mistakes to humans?), or vs. the judged clarity of each story. The ratings, as well as whether a question needs multiple sentences to answer, should typically only be used in evaluation, since such information is not generally available for most text. We will also provide an anonymized author id for each story, which could allow additional research such as using other works by the same author when understanding a story, or research on authorship attribution (e.g., Stamatatos, 2009). 9 Future Work We plan to use this dataset to evaluate approaches for machine comprehension, but are making it available now so that others may do the same. If MCTest is used we will collect more story sets and will continue to refine the collection process. One interesting research direction is ensuring that the questions are difficult enough to challenge state-ofthe-art techniques as they develop. One idea for this is to apply existing techniques automatically during story set creation to see whether a question is too easily answered by a machine. By requiring authors to create difficult questions, each data set will be made more and more difficult (but still answerable by humans) as the state-of-the-art methods advance. We will also experiment with timing the raters as they answer questions to see if we can find those that are too easy for people to answer. Removing such questions may increase the difficulty for machines as well. Additionally, any divergence between how easily a person answers a question vs. how easily a machine does may point toward new techniques for improving machine comprehension; we plan to conduct research in this direction as well as make any such data available for others. 10 Conclusion We present the MCTest dataset in the hope that it will help spur research into the machine comprehension of text. The metric (the accuracy on the question sets) is clearly defined, and on that metric, lexical baseline algorithms only attain approximately 58% correct on test data (the MC500 set) as opposed to the 100% correct that the majority of crowd-sourced judges attain. A key component of MCTest is the scalable design: we have shown that data whose quality approaches that of expertly cu- rated data can be generated using crowd sourcing coupled with expert correction of worker-identified errors. Should MCTest prove useful to the community, we will continue to gather data, both to increase the corpus size, and to keep the test sets fresh. The data is available at http://research.microsoft.com/mct and any submitted results will be posted there too. Because submissions will be requested to include the score for each test item, researchers will easily be able to compare their systems with those of others, and investigation of ensembles comprised of components from several different teams will be straightforward. MCTest also contains supplementary material that researchers may find useful, such as worker accuracies on a grammar test and crowd-sourced measures of the quality of their stories.

<p>Author: Tengfei Ma ; Hiroshi Nakagawa</p><p>Abstract: Document summarization is an important task in the area of natural language processing, which aims to extract the most important information from a single document or a cluster of documents. In various summarization tasks, the summary length is manually defined. However, how to find the proper summary length is quite a problem; and keeping all summaries restricted to the same length is not always a good choice. It is obviously improper to generate summaries with the same length for two clusters of documents which contain quite different quantity of information. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model for multidocument summarization in order to automatically determine the proper lengths of summaries. Assuming that an original document can be reconstructed from its summary, we describe the ”reconstruction” by a Bayesian framework which selects sentences to form a good summary. Experimental results on DUC2004 data sets and some expanded data demonstrate the good quality of our summaries and the rationality of the length determination.</p><p>5 0.36896679 <a title="179-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Personal_Profile_Summarization_with_Social_Networks.html">48 emnlp-2013-Collective Personal Profile Summarization with Social Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>6 0.33540171 <a title="179-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Discourse-Driven_Content_Model_for_Summarising_Scientific_Articles_Evaluated_in_a_Complex_Question_Answering_Task.html">5 emnlp-2013-A Discourse-Driven Content Model for Summarising Scientific Articles Evaluated in a Complex Question Answering Task</a></p>

<p>Author: Shize Xu ; Shanshan Wang ; Yan Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The rapid development of Web2.0 leads to significant information redundancy. Especially for a complex news event, it is difficult to understand its general idea within a single coherent picture. A complex event often contains branches, intertwining narratives and side news which are all called storylines. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to tackle the challenging problem of storylines extraction and reconstruction. Specifically, we first investigate two requisite properties of an ideal storyline. Then a unified algorithm is devised to extract all effective storylines by optimizing these properties at the same time. Finally, we reconstruct all extracted lines and generate the high-quality story map. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method is quite efficient and highly competitive, which can bring about quicker, clearer and deeper comprehension to readers.</p><p>2 0.68708718 <a title="179-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Elephant%3A_Sequence_Labeling_for_Word_and_Sentence_Segmentation.html">72 emnlp-2013-Elephant: Sequence Labeling for Word and Sentence Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kilian Evang ; Valerio Basile ; Grzegorz Chrupala ; Johan Bos</p><p>Abstract: Tokenization is widely regarded as a solved problem due to the high accuracy that rulebased tokenizers achieve. But rule-based tokenizers are hard to maintain and their rules language specific. We show that highaccuracy word and sentence segmentation can be achieved by using supervised sequence labeling on the character level combined with unsupervised feature learning. We evaluated our method on three languages and obtained error rates of 0.27 ‰ (English), 0.35 ‰ (Dutch) and 0.76 ‰ (Italian) for our best models. 1 An Elephant in the Room Tokenization, the task of segmenting a text into words and sentences, is often regarded as a solved problem in natural language processing (Dridan and . Oepen, 2012), probably because many corpora are already in tokenized format. But like an elephant in the living room, it is a problem that is impossible to overlook whenever new raw datasets need to be processed or when tokenization conventions are reconsidered. It is moreover an important problem, because any errors occurring early in the NLP pipeline affect further analysis negatively. And even though current tokenizers reach high performance, there are three issues that we feel haven’t been addressed satisfactorily so far: • • Most tokenizers are rule-based and therefore hard to maintain and hard to adapt to new domains and new languages (Silla Jr. and Kaestner, 2004); Word and sentence segmentation are often seen as separate tasks, but they obviously inform each other and it could be advantageous to view them as a combined task; 1422 bo s }@ rug .nl † g .chrupal a @ uvt .nl • Most tokenization methods provide no align- ment between raw and tokenized text, which makes mapping the tokenized version back onto the actual source hard or impossible. In short, we believe that regarding tokenization, there is still room for improvement, in particular on the methodological side of the task. We are particularly interested in the following questions: Can we use supervised learning to avoid hand-crafting rules? Can we use unsupervised feature learning to reduce feature engineering effort and boost performance? Can we use the same method across languages? Can we combine word and sentence boundary detection into one task? 2 Related Work Usually the text segmentation task is split into word tokenization and sentence boundary detection. Rulebased systems for finding word and sentence boundaries often are variations on matching hand-coded regular expressions (Grefenstette, 1999; Silla Jr. and Kaestner, 2004; Jurafsky and Martin, 2008; Dridan and Oepen, 2012). Several unsupervised systems have been proposed for sentence boundary detection. Kiss and Strunk (2006) present a language-independent, unsupervised approach and note that abbreviations form a major source of ambiguity in sentence boundary detection and use collocation detection to build a high-accuracy abbreviation detector. The resulting system reaches high accuracy, rivalling handcrafted rule-based and supervised systems. A similar system was proposed earlier by Mikheev (2002). Existing supervised learning approaches for sentence boundary detection use as features tokens preceding and following potential sentence boundary, part of speech, capitalization information and lists of abbreviations. Learning methods employed in Proce Sdeiantgtlse o,f W thaesh 2i0n1gt3o nC,o UnSfeAre,n 1c8e- o2n1 E Omctpoibriecra 2l0 M13et.h ?oc d2s0 i1n3 N Aastusorcaila Ltiaon g fuoarg Ceo Pmrpoucetastsi on ga,l p Laignegsu 1is4t2ic2s–1426, these approaches include maximum entropy models (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) decision trees (Riley, 1989), and neural networks (Palmer and Hearst, 1997). Closest to our work are approaches that present token and sentence splitters using conditional random fields (Tomanek et al., 2007; Fares et al., 2013). However, these previous approaches consider tokens (i.e. character sequences) as basic units for labeling, whereas we consider single characters. As a consequence, labeling is more resource-intensive, but it also gives us more expressive power. In fact, our approach kills two birds with one stone, as it allows us to integrate token and sentence boundaries detection into one task. 3 Method 3.1 IOB Tokenization IOB tagging is widely used in tasks identifying chunks of tokens. We use it to identify chunks of characters. Characters outside of tokens are labeled O, inside of tokens I. For characters at the beginning of tokens, we use S at sentence boundaries, otherwise T (for token). This scheme offers some nice features, like allowing for discontinuous tokens (e.g. hyphenated words at line breaks) and starting a new token in the middle of a typographic word if the tokenization scheme requires it, as e.g. in did|n ’t.

For example, with a context size of 3, in Figure 1, features for the E in Eighty-three with the output label S would be E/S, O/S, /S, i/S, Space/S, Lowercase/S. The intuition is that the 3 1 existing Unicode categories can generalize across similar characters whereas character features can identify specific contexts such as abbreviations or contractions (e.g. didn ’t). The context window sizes we use are 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, centered around the focus character. 3.4 Deep learning of features Automatically learned word embeddings have been successfully used in NLP to reduce reliance on manual feature engineering and boost performance. We adapt this approach to the character level, and thus, in addition to hand-crafted features we use text representations induced in an unsupervised fashion from character strings. A complete discussion of our approach to learning text embeddings can be found in (Chrupała, 2013). Here we provide a brief overview. Our representations correspond to the activation of the hidden layer in a simple recurrent neural (SRN) network (Elman, 1990; Elman, 1991), implemented in a customized version of Mikolov (2010)’s RNNLM toolkit. The network is sequentially presented with a large amount of raw text and learns to predict the next character in the sequence. It uses the units in the hidden layer to store a generalized representation of the recent history. After training the network on large amounts on unlabeled text, we run it on the training and test data, and record the activation of the hidden layer at each position in the string as it tries to predict the next character. The vector of activations of the hidden layer provides additional features used to train and run the CRF. For each of the K = 10 most active units out of total J = 400 hidden units, we create features (f(1) . . . f(K)) defined as f(k) = 1if sj(k) > 0.5 and f(k) = 0 otherwise, where sj (k) returns the activation of the kth most active unit. For training the SRN only raw text is necessary. We trained on the entire GMB 2.0.0 (2.5M characters), the portion of TwNC corresponding to January 2000 (43M characters) and a sample of the PAISA` corpus (39M characters). 4 Results and Evaluation In order to evaluate the quality of the tokenization produced by our models we conducted several experiments with different combinations of features and context sizes. For these tests, the models are trained on an 80% portion of the data sets and tested on a 10% development set. Final results are obtained on a 10% test set. We report both absolute number of errors and error rates per thousand (‰). 4.1 Feature sets We experiment with two kinds of features at the character level, namely Unicode categories (31 dif- ferent ones), Unicode character codes, and a combination of them. Unicode categories are less sparse than the character codes (there are 88, 134, and 502 unique characters for English, Dutch and Italian, respectively), so the combination provide some generalization over just character codes. Table 2: Error rates obtained with different feature sets. Cat stands for Unicode category, Code for Unicode character code, and Cat-Code for a union of these features. Error rates per thousand (‰) Feature setEnglishDutchItalian C ao td-9eC-9ode-94568 ( 0 1. 241950) 1,7 4807243 ( 12 . 685078) 1,65 459872 ( 12 . 162470) 1424 From these results we see that categories alone perform worse than only codes. For English there is no gain from the combination over using only character codes. For Dutch and Italian there is an improvement, although it is only significant for Italian (p = 0.480 and p = 0.005 respectively, binomial exact test). We use this feature combination in the experiments that follow. Note that these models are trained using a symmetrical context of 9 characters (four left and four right of the current character). In the next section we show performance of models with different window sizes. 4.2 Context window We run an experiment to evaluate how the size of the context in the training phase impacts the classification. In Table 4.2 we show the results for symmetrical windows ranging in size from 1to 13. Table 3: Using different context window sizes.

We combined these features with character code and Unicode category features in windows of different sizes. The results of this test are shown in Table 4. The first row shows the performance of SRN features on their own. The following rows show the combination of SRN features with the basic feature sets of varying window size. It can be seen that augmenting the feature sets with SRN features results in large reductions of error rates. The Cat-Code-1SRN setting has error rates comparable to Cat-Code9. The addition of SRN features to the two best previous models, Cat-Code-9 and Cat-Code-13, reduces the error rate by 83% resp. 81% for Dutch, and by 24% resp. 26% for Italian. All these differences are statistically significant according to the binomial test (p < 0.001). For English, there are too few errors to detect a statistically significant effect for Cat-Code-9 (p = 0.07), but for Cat-Code-13 we find p = 0.016.

This resulted in 10 errors (0.27 ‰) for English (GMB corpus), 199 errors (0.35 ‰) for Dutch (TwNC corpus), and 454 errors (0.76 ‰) for Italian (PAISA` corpus). 5 Discussion It is interesting to examine what kind of errors the SRN features help avoid. In the English and Dutch datasets many errors are caused by failure to recognize personal titles and initials or misparsing of numbers. In the Italian data, a large fraction of errors is due to verbs with clitics, which are written as a single word, but treated as separate tokens. Table 5 shows examples of errors made by a simpler model that are fixed by adding SRN features. Table 6 shows the confusion matrices for the Cat-Code-7 and CatCode-7-SRN sets on the Dutch data. The mistake most improved by SRN features is T/I with 89% error reduction (see also Table 5). The is also the most common remaining mistake. A comparison with other approaches is hard because of the difference in datasets and task definition (combined word/sentence segmentation). Here we just compare our results for sentence segmentation (sentence F1 score) with Punkt, a state-of-the1425 Table 5: Positive impact of SRN features.

With its standard distributed models, Punkt achieves 98.51% on our English test set, 98.87% on Dutch and 98.34% on Italian, compared with 100%, 99.54% and 99.51% for our system. Our system benefits here from its ability to adapt to a new domain with relatively little (but annotated) training data. 6 What Elephant? Word and sentence segmentation can be recast as a combined tagging task. This way, tokenization is cast as a supervised learning task, causing a shift of labor from writing rules to manually correcting labels. Learning this task with CRF achieves high accuracy.1 Furthermore, our tagging method does not lose the connection between original text and tokens. In future work, we plan to broaden the scope of this work to other steps in document preparation, 1All software needed to replicate our experiments is available at http : / / gmb . let . rug . nl / e lephant / experiments . php such as normalization of punctuation, and their interaction with segmentation. We further plan to test our method on a wider range of datasets, allowing a more direct comparison with other approaches. Finally, we plan to explore the possibility of a statistical universal segmentation model for mutliple languages and domains. In a famous scene with a live elephant on stage, the comedian Jimmy Durante was asked about it by a policeman and surprisedly answered: “What elephant?” We feel we can say the same now as far as tokenization is concerned.

<p>Author: Uri Lerner ; Slav Petrov</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple and novel classifier-based preordering approach. Unlike existing preordering models, we train feature-rich discriminative classifiers that directly predict the target-side word order. Our approach combines the strengths of lexical reordering and syntactic preordering models by performing long-distance reorderings using the structure of the parse tree, while utilizing a discriminative model with a rich set of features, including lexical features. We present extensive experiments on 22 language pairs, including preordering into English from 7 other languages. We obtain improvements of up to 1.4 BLEU on language pairs in the WMT 2010 shared task. For languages from different families the improvements often exceed 2 BLEU. Many of these gains are also significant in human evaluations.</p><p>4 0.56476521 <a title="179-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Optimized_Event_Storyline_Generation_based_on_Mixture-Event-Aspect_Model.html">147 emnlp-2013-Optimized Event Storyline Generation based on Mixture-Event-Aspect Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Lifu Huang ; Lian'en Huang</p><p>Abstract: Recently, much research focuses on event storyline generation, which aims to produce a concise, global and temporal event summary from a collection of articles. Generally, each event contains multiple sub-events and the storyline should be composed by the component summaries of all the sub-events. However, different sub-events have different part-whole relationship with the major event, which is important to correspond to users’ interests but seldom considered in previous work. To distinguish different types of sub-events, we propose a mixture-event-aspect model which models different sub-events into local and global aspects. Combining these local/global aspects with summarization requirements together, we utilize an optimization method to generate the component summaries along the timeline. We develop experimental systems on 6 distinctively different datasets. Evaluation and comparison results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p><p>5 0.56474525 <a title="179-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Biological_Processes_with_Global_Constraints.html">118 emnlp-2013-Learning Biological Processes with Global Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Aju Thalappillil Scaria ; Jonathan Berant ; Mengqiu Wang ; Peter Clark ; Justin Lewis ; Brittany Harding ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Biological processes are complex phenomena involving a series of events that are related to one another through various relationships. Systems that can understand and reason over biological processes would dramatically improve the performance of semantic applications involving inference such as question answering (QA) – specifically “How? ” and “Why? ” questions. In this paper, we present the task of process extraction, in which events within a process and the relations between the events are automatically extracted from text. We represent processes by graphs whose edges describe a set oftemporal, causal and co-reference event-event relations, and characterize the structural properties of these graphs (e.g., the graphs are connected). Then, we present a method for extracting relations between the events, which exploits these structural properties by performing joint in- ference over the set of extracted relations. On a novel dataset containing 148 descriptions of biological processes (released with this paper), we show significant improvement comparing to baselines that disregard process structure.</p><p>6 0.55889261 <a title="179-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Left-to-Right_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation_with_Improved_Reordering.html">71 emnlp-2013-Efficient Left-to-Right Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation with Improved Reordering</a></p>

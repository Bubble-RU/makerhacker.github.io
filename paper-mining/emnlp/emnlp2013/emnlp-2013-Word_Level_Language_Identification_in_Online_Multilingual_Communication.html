</p><p>4 For our experiments with multilingual online discussions, we first tag the language of individual words using language models and dictionaries. [sent-7, score-0.316]
</p><p>5 Besides word level accuracy, we use two new metrics to evaluate this task. [sent-10, score-0.07]
</p><p>6 1 Introduction There are more multilingual speakers in the world than monolingual speakers (Auer and Wei, 2007). [sent-11, score-0.442]
</p><p>7 Multilingual speakers switch across languages in daily communication (Auer, 1999). [sent-12, score-0.435]
</p><p>8 With the in-  creasing use of social media, multilingual speakers also communicate with each other in online environments (Paolillo, 2011). [sent-13, score-0.417]
</p><p>9 Data from such resources can be used to study code switching patterns and language preferences in online multilingual conversations. [sent-14, score-0.318]
</p><p>10 Although most studies on multilingual online communication rely on manual identification of languages in relatively small datasets (Danet and Herring, 2007; Androutsopoulos, 2007), there is a growing demand for automatic language identification in larger datasets. [sent-15, score-0.817]
</p><p>11 Such a system would also be useful for selecting the right parsers to process multilingual documents and to build language resources for minority languages (King and Abney, 2013). [sent-16, score-0.303]
</p><p>12 In this paper, we identify Dutch (NL) en Turkish (TR) at the word level in a large online forum for Turkish-Dutch speakers living in the Netherlands. [sent-20, score-0.309]
</p><p>13 The users in the forum frequently switch languages within posts, for example:   Sariyi ver     Wel mooi doelpunt    So far, language identification has mostly been modeled as a document classification problem. [sent-21, score-0.534]
</p><p>14 Most approaches rely on character or byte n-grams, by comparing n-gram profiles (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994), or using various machine learning classifiers. [sent-22, score-0.091]
</p><p>15 While McNamee (2005) argues that language identification is a solved problem, classification on a more finegrained level (instead of document level) remains a challenge (Hughes et al. [sent-23, score-0.238]
</p><p>16 Furthermore, language identification is more difficult for short texts (Baldwin and Lui, 2010; Vatanen et al. [sent-25, score-0.16]
</p><p>17 Tagging individual words (without context) has been done using dictionaries, affix statistics and classifiers using character n-grams (Hammarstr o¨m, 2007; Gottron and Lipka, 2010). [sent-29, score-0.086]
</p><p>18 Although Yamaguchi and Tanaka-Ishii (2012) segmented text by language, their data was artificially created by randomly sampling and concatenating text segments (40-160 characters) from monolingual texts. [sent-30, score-0.096]
</p><p>19 Therefore, the language switches do not reflect realistic switches as they occur in natural texts. [sent-31, score-0.22]
</p><p>20 Most related to ours is the work by King and Abney (2013) who labeled  languages of words in multilingual web pages, but evaluated the task only using word level accuracy. [sent-32, score-0.34]
</p><p>21 2 Corpus Our data1 comes from one of the largest online communities in The Netherlands for Turkish-Dutch speakers. [sent-39, score-0.075]
</p><p>22 All posts from May 2006 until October 2012 were crawled. [sent-40, score-0.267]
</p><p>23 Examples 1 and 2 illustrate switches between Dutch and Turkish within the same post. [sent-45, score-0.11]
</p><p>24 Example 1 is a switch at sentence level, example 2 is a switch at word level. [sent-46, score-0.25]

</p><p>29 The following tokens were ignored for language identification: •  • • • •  •  Smileys (as part of the forum markup, as well as tielxetyusal ( smileys fsu tchhe as “:)” ). [sent-61, score-0.248]
</p><p>30 Posts for which all tokens are ignored, are not included in the corpus. [sent-70, score-0.086]
</p><p>31 posts) are short, with on average 18 tokens per document. [sent-76, score-0.086]
</p><p>32 The data represents realistic texts found in online multilingual communication. [sent-77, score-0.277]
</p><p>33 1 Training Corpora We used the following corpora to extract dictionaries and language models. [sent-80, score-0.118]
</p><p>34 Each corpus was chunked into large segments which were then selected randomly until 5M tokens were obtained for each language. [sent-86, score-0.122]
</p><p>35 TextCat is based on the comparison of n-gram profiles and langid. [sent-91, score-0.044]
</p><p>36 Words for which no language could be determined were assigned to Dutch. [sent-94, score-0.038]
</p><p>37 These models were developed to identify the languages of the documents instead of words and we did not retrain them. [sent-95, score-0.101]
</p><p>38 3 Models We start with models that assign languages based on only the current word. [sent-98, score-0.101]
</p><p>39 Words with the highest probability for English were assigned to Dutch for evaluation. [sent-100, score-0.038]
</p><p>40 Dictionary lookup (DICT) We extract dictionaries with word frequencies from the training corpora. [sent-101, score-0.158]
</p><p>41 This approach looks up the words in the dictionaries and chooses the language for which the word has the highest probability. [sent-102, score-0.118]

</p><p>44 Logistic Regression (LR) We use a logistic regression model that incorporates context with the following features: •  •  (Individual word) Label assigned by the (DI InCdiTv+idLuMal model. [sent-114, score-0.125]
</p><p>45 the sequence “ben thuis” (am home) as a whole if ben is the current token). [sent-117, score-0.037]

</p><p>51 5  Evaluation  The assigned labels can be used for computational analysis of multilingual data in different ways. [sent-134, score-0.24]
</p><p>52 For example, these labels can be used to analyze language preferences in multilingual communication or the direction of the switches (from Turkish to Dutch or the other way around). [sent-135, score-0.472]
</p><p>53 The evaluation at word and post levels is done with the following metrics: •  Word classification precision (P), recall (R) and accuracy. [sent-137, score-0.196]

</p><p>55 This evaluates the measured proportion of languages in a post when the actual tags for individual words are not needed. [sent-140, score-0.295]
</p><p>56 For example, such information is useful for analyzing the language preferences of users in the online forum. [sent-141, score-0.149]
</p><p>57 Besides reporting the MAE over all posts, we also separate the performance over monolingual and bilingual posts (BL). [sent-142, score-0.435]

</p><p>59 Our posts are classified as NL, TR or bilingual (BL) if all words are tagged in the particular language or both. [sent-144, score-0.45]
</p><p>60 Significance tests were done by comparing the results of the word and post classification measures using McNemar’s  test, and comparing the MAEs using paired t-tests. [sent-147, score-0.196]
</p><p>61 All runs were significantly different from each other based on these tests (p < 0. [sent-148, score-0.04]
</p><p>62 05), except the MAEs of the D ICT+LM and LR+LAB runs and the MAEs and post classification metrics between the CRFs runs. [sent-149, score-0.269]
</p><p>63 The difficulty of the task is illustrated by examining the coverage of the tokens by the dictionaries. [sent-150, score-0.086]
</p><p>64 6% of the tokens (dev + test set) appear in both dictionaries, 31. [sent-152, score-0.086]
</p><p>65 This confirms that language identification at the word level needs different approaches than identification at the document level. [sent-157, score-0.357]
</p><p>66 The combination of language models and dictionaries is more effective than the individual models. [sent-160, score-0.157]
</p><p>67 The results improve when context was added using a logistic regression model, especially with the probability values as feature values. [sent-161, score-0.087]
</p><p>68 More specifi-  cally, CRFs improve the performance on monolingual posts, especially when a single word is tagged in the wrong language. [sent-163, score-0.093]
</p><p>69 However, when the influence of the context is too high, CRFs reduce the performance in bilingual posts. [sent-164, score-0.108]
</p><p>70 This is also illustrated with the results of the post classification. [sent-165, score-0.155]

</p><p>72 The fraction of Dutch and Turkish in posts varies widely, providing additional challenges to the use of CRFs for this task. [sent-171, score-0.267]
</p><p>73 Classifying posts first as monolingual/bilingual and tagging individual words afterwards for bilingual posts might improve the performance. [sent-172, score-0.681]
</p><p>74 The evaluation metrics highlight different aspects of the task whereas word level accuracy gives a limited view. [sent-173, score-0.07]
</p><p>75 We suggest using multiple metrics to evaluate this task for future research. [sent-174, score-0.033]
</p><p>76 Dictionaries versus Language Models The results reported in Table 2 were obtained by sampling 5M tokens of each language. [sent-175, score-0.086]
</p><p>77 To study the effect of the number of tokens on the performance  of the D ICT and LM runs, we vary the amount of data. [sent-176, score-0.086]
</p><p>78 This is probably due to the highly informal and noisy nature of our data. [sent-179, score-0.065]

</p><p>80 Posts were classified as a particular language if all  words were tagged as belonging to that language, and bilingual otherwise. [sent-185, score-0.183]
</p><p>81 10 classifies posts as TR if at least 90% of the words are classified as TR). [sent-190, score-0.309]
</p><p>82 Allowing a small margin already increases the results of simpler approaches (such as the LR-PROB run, Table 3) by making it more robust against errors. [sent-191, score-0.054]
</p><p>83 However, allowing a margin reduces the performance of the CRF runs. [sent-192, score-0.054]

</p><p>86 For example, the word super in “Seyma, super” is annotated as Turkish since Seyma is also a Turkish word. [sent-211, score-0.042]
</p><p>87 Based on precompiled lists, our system ignores named entities. [sent-213, score-0.032]
</p><p>88 5  Conclusion  We presented experiments on identifying the language of individual words in multilingual conversational data. [sent-217, score-0.291]
</p><p>89 Our results reveal that language models are more robust than dictionaries and adding context improves the performance. [sent-218, score-0.118]
</p><p>90 We evaluate our methods from different perspectives based on how language identification at word level can be used to analyze multilingual data. [sent-219, score-0.399]

<p>Author: Kilian Evang ; Valerio Basile ; Grzegorz Chrupala ; Johan Bos</p><p>Abstract: Tokenization is widely regarded as a solved problem due to the high accuracy that rulebased tokenizers achieve. But rule-based tokenizers are hard to maintain and their rules language specific. We show that highaccuracy word and sentence segmentation can be achieved by using supervised sequence labeling on the character level combined with unsupervised feature learning. We evaluated our method on three languages and obtained error rates of 0.27 ‰ (English), 0.35 ‰ (Dutch) and 0.76 ‰ (Italian) for our best models. 1 An Elephant in the Room Tokenization, the task of segmenting a text into words and sentences, is often regarded as a solved problem in natural language processing (Dridan and . Oepen, 2012), probably because many corpora are already in tokenized format. But like an elephant in the living room, it is a problem that is impossible to overlook whenever new raw datasets need to be processed or when tokenization conventions are reconsidered. It is moreover an important problem, because any errors occurring early in the NLP pipeline affect further analysis negatively. And even though current tokenizers reach high performance, there are three issues that we feel haven’t been addressed satisfactorily so far: • • Most tokenizers are rule-based and therefore hard to maintain and hard to adapt to new domains and new languages (Silla Jr. and Kaestner, 2004); Word and sentence segmentation are often seen as separate tasks, but they obviously inform each other and it could be advantageous to view them as a combined task; 1422 bo s }@ rug .nl † g .chrupal a @ uvt .nl • Most tokenization methods provide no align- ment between raw and tokenized text, which makes mapping the tokenized version back onto the actual source hard or impossible. In short, we believe that regarding tokenization, there is still room for improvement, in particular on the methodological side of the task. We are particularly interested in the following questions: Can we use supervised learning to avoid hand-crafting rules? Can we use unsupervised feature learning to reduce feature engineering effort and boost performance? Can we use the same method across languages? Can we combine word and sentence boundary detection into one task? 2 Related Work Usually the text segmentation task is split into word tokenization and sentence boundary detection. Rulebased systems for finding word and sentence boundaries often are variations on matching hand-coded regular expressions (Grefenstette, 1999; Silla Jr. and Kaestner, 2004; Jurafsky and Martin, 2008; Dridan and Oepen, 2012). Several unsupervised systems have been proposed for sentence boundary detection. Kiss and Strunk (2006) present a language-independent, unsupervised approach and note that abbreviations form a major source of ambiguity in sentence boundary detection and use collocation detection to build a high-accuracy abbreviation detector. The resulting system reaches high accuracy, rivalling handcrafted rule-based and supervised systems. A similar system was proposed earlier by Mikheev (2002). Existing supervised learning approaches for sentence boundary detection use as features tokens preceding and following potential sentence boundary, part of speech, capitalization information and lists of abbreviations. Learning methods employed in Proce Sdeiantgtlse o,f W thaesh 2i0n1gt3o nC,o UnSfeAre,n 1c8e- o2n1 E Omctpoibriecra 2l0 M13et.h ?oc d2s0 i1n3 N Aastusorcaila Ltiaon g fuoarg Ceo Pmrpoucetastsi on ga,l p Laignegsu 1is4t2ic2s–1426, these approaches include maximum entropy models (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) decision trees (Riley, 1989), and neural networks (Palmer and Hearst, 1997). Closest to our work are approaches that present token and sentence splitters using conditional random fields (Tomanek et al., 2007; Fares et al., 2013). However, these previous approaches consider tokens (i.e. character sequences) as basic units for labeling, whereas we consider single characters. As a consequence, labeling is more resource-intensive, but it also gives us more expressive power. In fact, our approach kills two birds with one stone, as it allows us to integrate token and sentence boundaries detection into one task. 3 Method 3.1 IOB Tokenization IOB tagging is widely used in tasks identifying chunks of tokens. We use it to identify chunks of characters. Characters outside of tokens are labeled O, inside of tokens I. For characters at the beginning of tokens, we use S at sentence boundaries, otherwise T (for token). This scheme offers some nice features, like allowing for discontinuous tokens (e.g. hyphenated words at line breaks) and starting a new token in the middle of a typographic word if the tokenization scheme requires it, as e.g. in did|n ’t.

PAISA` Table 1: Datasets characteristics.

For example, with a context size of 3, in Figure 1, features for the E in Eighty-three with the output label S would be E/S, O/S, /S, i/S, Space/S, Lowercase/S. The intuition is that the 3 1 existing Unicode categories can generalize across similar characters whereas character features can identify specific contexts such as abbreviations or contractions (e.g. didn ’t). The context window sizes we use are 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, centered around the focus character. 3.4 Deep learning of features Automatically learned word embeddings have been successfully used in NLP to reduce reliance on manual feature engineering and boost performance. We adapt this approach to the character level, and thus, in addition to hand-crafted features we use text representations induced in an unsupervised fashion from character strings. A complete discussion of our approach to learning text embeddings can be found in (Chrupała, 2013). Here we provide a brief overview. Our representations correspond to the activation of the hidden layer in a simple recurrent neural (SRN) network (Elman, 1990; Elman, 1991), implemented in a customized version of Mikolov (2010)’s RNNLM toolkit. The network is sequentially presented with a large amount of raw text and learns to predict the next character in the sequence. It uses the units in the hidden layer to store a generalized representation of the recent history. After training the network on large amounts on unlabeled text, we run it on the training and test data, and record the activation of the hidden layer at each position in the string as it tries to predict the next character. The vector of activations of the hidden layer provides additional features used to train and run the CRF. For each of the K = 10 most active units out of total J = 400 hidden units, we create features (f(1) . . . f(K)) defined as f(k) = 1if sj(k) > 0.5 and f(k) = 0 otherwise, where sj (k) returns the activation of the kth most active unit. For training the SRN only raw text is necessary. We trained on the entire GMB 2.0.0 (2.5M characters), the portion of TwNC corresponding to January 2000 (43M characters) and a sample of the PAISA` corpus (39M characters). 4 Results and Evaluation In order to evaluate the quality of the tokenization produced by our models we conducted several experiments with different combinations of features and context sizes. For these tests, the models are trained on an 80% portion of the data sets and tested on a 10% development set. Final results are obtained on a 10% test set. We report both absolute number of errors and error rates per thousand (‰). 4.1 Feature sets We experiment with two kinds of features at the character level, namely Unicode categories (31 dif- ferent ones), Unicode character codes, and a combination of them. Unicode categories are less sparse than the character codes (there are 88, 134, and 502 unique characters for English, Dutch and Italian, respectively), so the combination provide some generalization over just character codes. Table 2: Error rates obtained with different feature sets. Cat stands for Unicode category, Code for Unicode character code, and Cat-Code for a union of these features. Error rates per thousand (‰) Feature setEnglishDutchItalian C ao td-9eC-9ode-94568 ( 0 1. 241950) 1,7 4807243 ( 12 . 685078) 1,65 459872 ( 12 . 162470) 1424 From these results we see that categories alone perform worse than only codes. For English there is no gain from the combination over using only character codes. For Dutch and Italian there is an improvement, although it is only significant for Italian (p = 0.480 and p = 0.005 respectively, binomial exact test). We use this feature combination in the experiments that follow. Note that these models are trained using a symmetrical context of 9 characters (four left and four right of the current character). In the next section we show performance of models with different window sizes. 4.2 Context window We run an experiment to evaluate how the size of the context in the training phase impacts the classification. In Table 4.2 we show the results for symmetrical windows ranging in size from 1to 13. Table 3: Using different context window sizes.

We combined these features with character code and Unicode category features in windows of different sizes. The results of this test are shown in Table 4. The first row shows the performance of SRN features on their own. The following rows show the combination of SRN features with the basic feature sets of varying window size. It can be seen that augmenting the feature sets with SRN features results in large reductions of error rates. The Cat-Code-1SRN setting has error rates comparable to Cat-Code9. The addition of SRN features to the two best previous models, Cat-Code-9 and Cat-Code-13, reduces the error rate by 83% resp. 81% for Dutch, and by 24% resp. 26% for Italian. All these differences are statistically significant according to the binomial test (p < 0.001). For English, there are too few errors to detect a statistically significant effect for Cat-Code-9 (p = 0.07), but for Cat-Code-13 we find p = 0.016. Table 4: Results obtained using different context window sizes and addition of SRN features.

This resulted in 10 errors (0.27 ‰) for English (GMB corpus), 199 errors (0.35 ‰) for Dutch (TwNC corpus), and 454 errors (0.76 ‰) for Italian (PAISA` corpus). 5 Discussion It is interesting to examine what kind of errors the SRN features help avoid. In the English and Dutch datasets many errors are caused by failure to recognize personal titles and initials or misparsing of numbers. In the Italian data, a large fraction of errors is due to verbs with clitics, which are written as a single word, but treated as separate tokens. Table 5 shows examples of errors made by a simpler model that are fixed by adding SRN features. Table 6 shows the confusion matrices for the Cat-Code-7 and CatCode-7-SRN sets on the Dutch data. The mistake most improved by SRN features is T/I with 89% error reduction (see also Table 5). The is also the most common remaining mistake. A comparison with other approaches is hard because of the difference in datasets and task definition (combined word/sentence segmentation). Here we just compare our results for sentence segmentation (sentence F1 score) with Punkt, a state-of-the1425 Table 5: Positive impact of SRN features.

With its standard distributed models, Punkt achieves 98.51% on our English test set, 98.87% on Dutch and 98.34% on Italian, compared with 100%, 99.54% and 99.51% for our system. Our system benefits here from its ability to adapt to a new domain with relatively little (but annotated) training data. 6 What Elephant? Word and sentence segmentation can be recast as a combined tagging task. This way, tokenization is cast as a supervised learning task, causing a shift of labor from writing rules to manually correcting labels. Learning this task with CRF achieves high accuracy.1 Furthermore, our tagging method does not lose the connection between original text and tokens. In future work, we plan to broaden the scope of this work to other steps in document preparation, 1All software needed to replicate our experiments is available at http : / / gmb . let . rug . nl / e lephant / experiments . php such as normalization of punctuation, and their interaction with segmentation. We further plan to test our method on a wider range of datasets, allowing a more direct comparison with other approaches. Finally, we plan to explore the possibility of a statistical universal segmentation model for mutliple languages and domains. In a famous scene with a live elephant on stage, the comedian Jimmy Durante was asked about it by a policeman and surprisedly answered: “What elephant?” We feel we can say the same now as far as tokenization is concerned.

<p>Author: Kilian Evang ; Valerio Basile ; Grzegorz Chrupala ; Johan Bos</p><p>Abstract: Tokenization is widely regarded as a solved problem due to the high accuracy that rulebased tokenizers achieve. But rule-based tokenizers are hard to maintain and their rules language specific. We show that highaccuracy word and sentence segmentation can be achieved by using supervised sequence labeling on the character level combined with unsupervised feature learning. We evaluated our method on three languages and obtained error rates of 0.27 ‰ (English), 0.35 ‰ (Dutch) and 0.76 ‰ (Italian) for our best models. 1 An Elephant in the Room Tokenization, the task of segmenting a text into words and sentences, is often regarded as a solved problem in natural language processing (Dridan and . Oepen, 2012), probably because many corpora are already in tokenized format. But like an elephant in the living room, it is a problem that is impossible to overlook whenever new raw datasets need to be processed or when tokenization conventions are reconsidered. It is moreover an important problem, because any errors occurring early in the NLP pipeline affect further analysis negatively. And even though current tokenizers reach high performance, there are three issues that we feel haven’t been addressed satisfactorily so far: • • Most tokenizers are rule-based and therefore hard to maintain and hard to adapt to new domains and new languages (Silla Jr. and Kaestner, 2004); Word and sentence segmentation are often seen as separate tasks, but they obviously inform each other and it could be advantageous to view them as a combined task; 1422 bo s }@ rug .nl † g .chrupal a @ uvt .nl • Most tokenization methods provide no align- ment between raw and tokenized text, which makes mapping the tokenized version back onto the actual source hard or impossible. In short, we believe that regarding tokenization, there is still room for improvement, in particular on the methodological side of the task. We are particularly interested in the following questions: Can we use supervised learning to avoid hand-crafting rules? Can we use unsupervised feature learning to reduce feature engineering effort and boost performance? Can we use the same method across languages? Can we combine word and sentence boundary detection into one task? 2 Related Work Usually the text segmentation task is split into word tokenization and sentence boundary detection. Rulebased systems for finding word and sentence boundaries often are variations on matching hand-coded regular expressions (Grefenstette, 1999; Silla Jr. and Kaestner, 2004; Jurafsky and Martin, 2008; Dridan and Oepen, 2012). Several unsupervised systems have been proposed for sentence boundary detection. Kiss and Strunk (2006) present a language-independent, unsupervised approach and note that abbreviations form a major source of ambiguity in sentence boundary detection and use collocation detection to build a high-accuracy abbreviation detector. The resulting system reaches high accuracy, rivalling handcrafted rule-based and supervised systems. A similar system was proposed earlier by Mikheev (2002). Existing supervised learning approaches for sentence boundary detection use as features tokens preceding and following potential sentence boundary, part of speech, capitalization information and lists of abbreviations. Learning methods employed in Proce Sdeiantgtlse o,f W thaesh 2i0n1gt3o nC,o UnSfeAre,n 1c8e- o2n1 E Omctpoibriecra 2l0 M13et.h ?oc d2s0 i1n3 N Aastusorcaila Ltiaon g fuoarg Ceo Pmrpoucetastsi on ga,l p Laignegsu 1is4t2ic2s–1426, these approaches include maximum entropy models (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) decision trees (Riley, 1989), and neural networks (Palmer and Hearst, 1997). Closest to our work are approaches that present token and sentence splitters using conditional random fields (Tomanek et al., 2007; Fares et al., 2013). However, these previous approaches consider tokens (i.e. character sequences) as basic units for labeling, whereas we consider single characters. As a consequence, labeling is more resource-intensive, but it also gives us more expressive power. In fact, our approach kills two birds with one stone, as it allows us to integrate token and sentence boundaries detection into one task. 3 Method 3.1 IOB Tokenization IOB tagging is widely used in tasks identifying chunks of tokens. We use it to identify chunks of characters. Characters outside of tokens are labeled O, inside of tokens I. For characters at the beginning of tokens, we use S at sentence boundaries, otherwise T (for token). This scheme offers some nice features, like allowing for discontinuous tokens (e.g. hyphenated words at line breaks) and starting a new token in the middle of a typographic word if the tokenization scheme requires it, as e.g. in did|n ’t.

For example, with a context size of 3, in Figure 1, features for the E in Eighty-three with the output label S would be E/S, O/S, /S, i/S, Space/S, Lowercase/S. The intuition is that the 3 1 existing Unicode categories can generalize across similar characters whereas character features can identify specific contexts such as abbreviations or contractions (e.g. didn ’t). The context window sizes we use are 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, centered around the focus character. 3.4 Deep learning of features Automatically learned word embeddings have been successfully used in NLP to reduce reliance on manual feature engineering and boost performance. We adapt this approach to the character level, and thus, in addition to hand-crafted features we use text representations induced in an unsupervised fashion from character strings. A complete discussion of our approach to learning text embeddings can be found in (Chrupała, 2013). Here we provide a brief overview. Our representations correspond to the activation of the hidden layer in a simple recurrent neural (SRN) network (Elman, 1990; Elman, 1991), implemented in a customized version of Mikolov (2010)’s RNNLM toolkit. The network is sequentially presented with a large amount of raw text and learns to predict the next character in the sequence. It uses the units in the hidden layer to store a generalized representation of the recent history. After training the network on large amounts on unlabeled text, we run it on the training and test data, and record the activation of the hidden layer at each position in the string as it tries to predict the next character. The vector of activations of the hidden layer provides additional features used to train and run the CRF. For each of the K = 10 most active units out of total J = 400 hidden units, we create features (f(1) . . . f(K)) defined as f(k) = 1if sj(k) > 0.5 and f(k) = 0 otherwise, where sj (k) returns the activation of the kth most active unit. For training the SRN only raw text is necessary. We trained on the entire GMB 2.0.0 (2.5M characters), the portion of TwNC corresponding to January 2000 (43M characters) and a sample of the PAISA` corpus (39M characters). 4 Results and Evaluation In order to evaluate the quality of the tokenization produced by our models we conducted several experiments with different combinations of features and context sizes. For these tests, the models are trained on an 80% portion of the data sets and tested on a 10% development set. Final results are obtained on a 10% test set. We report both absolute number of errors and error rates per thousand (‰). 4.1 Feature sets We experiment with two kinds of features at the character level, namely Unicode categories (31 dif- ferent ones), Unicode character codes, and a combination of them. Unicode categories are less sparse than the character codes (there are 88, 134, and 502 unique characters for English, Dutch and Italian, respectively), so the combination provide some generalization over just character codes. Table 2: Error rates obtained with different feature sets. Cat stands for Unicode category, Code for Unicode character code, and Cat-Code for a union of these features. Error rates per thousand (‰) Feature setEnglishDutchItalian C ao td-9eC-9ode-94568 ( 0 1. 241950) 1,7 4807243 ( 12 . 685078) 1,65 459872 ( 12 . 162470) 1424 From these results we see that categories alone perform worse than only codes. For English there is no gain from the combination over using only character codes. For Dutch and Italian there is an improvement, although it is only significant for Italian (p = 0.480 and p = 0.005 respectively, binomial exact test). We use this feature combination in the experiments that follow. Note that these models are trained using a symmetrical context of 9 characters (four left and four right of the current character). In the next section we show performance of models with different window sizes. 4.2 Context window We run an experiment to evaluate how the size of the context in the training phase impacts the classification. In Table 4.2 we show the results for symmetrical windows ranging in size from 1to 13. Table 3: Using different context window sizes.

We combined these features with character code and Unicode category features in windows of different sizes. The results of this test are shown in Table 4. The first row shows the performance of SRN features on their own. The following rows show the combination of SRN features with the basic feature sets of varying window size. It can be seen that augmenting the feature sets with SRN features results in large reductions of error rates. The Cat-Code-1SRN setting has error rates comparable to Cat-Code9. The addition of SRN features to the two best previous models, Cat-Code-9 and Cat-Code-13, reduces the error rate by 83% resp. 81% for Dutch, and by 24% resp. 26% for Italian. All these differences are statistically significant according to the binomial test (p < 0.001). For English, there are too few errors to detect a statistically significant effect for Cat-Code-9 (p = 0.07), but for Cat-Code-13 we find p = 0.016. Table 4: Results obtained using different context window sizes and addition of SRN features.

This resulted in 10 errors (0.27 ‰) for English (GMB corpus), 199 errors (0.35 ‰) for Dutch (TwNC corpus), and 454 errors (0.76 ‰) for Italian (PAISA` corpus). 5 Discussion It is interesting to examine what kind of errors the SRN features help avoid. In the English and Dutch datasets many errors are caused by failure to recognize personal titles and initials or misparsing of numbers. In the Italian data, a large fraction of errors is due to verbs with clitics, which are written as a single word, but treated as separate tokens. Table 5 shows examples of errors made by a simpler model that are fixed by adding SRN features. Table 6 shows the confusion matrices for the Cat-Code-7 and CatCode-7-SRN sets on the Dutch data. The mistake most improved by SRN features is T/I with 89% error reduction (see also Table 5). The is also the most common remaining mistake. A comparison with other approaches is hard because of the difference in datasets and task definition (combined word/sentence segmentation). Here we just compare our results for sentence segmentation (sentence F1 score) with Punkt, a state-of-the1425 Table 5: Positive impact of SRN features.

With its standard distributed models, Punkt achieves 98.51% on our English test set, 98.87% on Dutch and 98.34% on Italian, compared with 100%, 99.54% and 99.51% for our system. Our system benefits here from its ability to adapt to a new domain with relatively little (but annotated) training data. 6 What Elephant? Word and sentence segmentation can be recast as a combined tagging task. This way, tokenization is cast as a supervised learning task, causing a shift of labor from writing rules to manually correcting labels. Learning this task with CRF achieves high accuracy.1 Furthermore, our tagging method does not lose the connection between original text and tokens. In future work, we plan to broaden the scope of this work to other steps in document preparation, 1All software needed to replicate our experiments is available at http : / / gmb . let . rug . nl / e lephant / experiments . php such as normalization of punctuation, and their interaction with segmentation. We further plan to test our method on a wider range of datasets, allowing a more direct comparison with other approaches. Finally, we plan to explore the possibility of a statistical universal segmentation model for mutliple languages and domains. In a famous scene with a live elephant on stage, the comedian Jimmy Durante was asked about it by a policeman and surprisedly answered: “What elephant?” We feel we can say the same now as far as tokenization is concerned.

<p>Author: Yi Yang ; Jacob Eisenstein</p><p>Abstract: We present a unified unsupervised statistical model for text normalization. The relationship between standard and non-standard tokens is characterized by a log-linear model, permitting arbitrary features. The weights of these features are trained in a maximumlikelihood framework, employing a novel sequential Monte Carlo training algorithm to overcome the large label space, which would be impractical for traditional dynamic programming solutions. This model is implemented in a normalization system called UNLOL, which achieves the best known results on two normalization datasets, outperforming more complex systems. We use the output of UNLOL to automatically normalize a large corpus of social media text, revealing a set of coherent orthographic styles that underlie online language variation.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.79094827 <a title="204-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Word_Level_Language_Identification_in_Online_Multilingual_Communication.html">204 emnlp-2013-Word Level Language Identification in Online Multilingual Communication</a></p>

Manning</p><p>Abstract: Biological processes are complex phenomena involving a series of events that are related to one another through various relationships. Systems that can understand and reason over biological processes would dramatically improve the performance of semantic applications involving inference such as question answering (QA) – specifically “How? ” and “Why? ” questions. In this paper, we present the task of process extraction, in which events within a process and the relations between the events are automatically extracted from text. We represent processes by graphs whose edges describe a set oftemporal, causal and co-reference event-event relations, and characterize the structural properties of these graphs (e.g., the graphs are connected). Then, we present a method for extracting relations between the events, which exploits these structural properties by performing joint in- ference over the set of extracted relations. On a novel dataset containing 148 descriptions of biological processes (released with this paper), we show significant improvement comparing to baselines that disregard process structure.</p><p>4 0.56235063 <a title="204-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Semantically_Enhanced_Approach_to_Determine_Textual_Similarity.html">12 emnlp-2013-A Semantically Enhanced Approach to Determine Textual Similarity</a></p>

<p>Author: Valentin I. Spitkovsky ; Hiyan Alshawi ; Daniel Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: Many statistical learning problems in NLP call for local model search methods. But accuracy tends to suffer with current techniques, which often explore either too narrowly or too broadly: hill-climbers can get stuck in local optima, whereas samplers may be inefficient. We propose to arrange individual local optimizers into organized networks. Our building blocks are operators of two types: (i) transform, which suggests new places to search, via non-random restarts from already-found local optima; and (ii) join, which merges candidate solutions to find better optima. Experiments on grammar induction show that pursuing different transforms (e.g., discarding parts of a learned model or ignoring portions of training data) results in improvements. Groups of locally-optimal solutions can be further perturbed jointly, by constructing mixtures. Using these tools, we designed several modular dependency grammar induction networks of increasing complexity. Our complete sys- tem achieves 48.6% accuracy (directed dependency macro-average over all 19 languages in the 2006/7 CoNLL data) more than 5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art. —</p><p>4 0.030154433 <a title="54-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Measuring_Ideological_Proportions_in_Political_Speeches.html">129 emnlp-2013-Measuring Ideological Proportions in Political Speeches</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanchuan Sim ; Brice D. L. Acree ; Justin H. Gross ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We seek to measure political candidates’ ideological positioning from their speeches. To accomplish this, we infer ideological cues from a corpus of political writings annotated with known ideologies. We then represent the speeches of U.S. Presidential candidates as sequences of cues and lags (filler distinguished only by its length in words). We apply a domain-informed Bayesian HMM to infer the proportions of ideologies each candidate uses in each campaign. The results are validated against a set of preregistered, domain expertauthored hypotheses.</p><p>5 0.026464349 <a title="54-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Mining_New_Business_Opportunities%3A_Identifying_Trend_related_Products_by_Leveraging_Commercial_Intents_from_Microblogs.html">131 emnlp-2013-Mining New Business Opportunities: Identifying Trend related Products by Leveraging Commercial Intents from Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinpeng Wang ; Wayne Xin Zhao ; Haitian Wei ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Hot trends are likely to bring new business opportunities. For example, “Air Pollution” might lead to a significant increase of the sales of related products, e.g., mouth mask. For ecommerce companies, it is very important to make rapid and correct response to these hot trends in order to improve product sales. In this paper, we take the initiative to study the task of how to identify trend related products. The major novelty of our work is that we automatically learn commercial intents revealed from microblogs. We carefully construct a data collection for this task and present quite a few insightful findings. In order to solve this problem, we further propose a graph based method, which jointly models relevance and associativity. We perform extensive experiments and the results showed that our methods are very effective.</p><p>6 0.024205359 <a title="54-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Bootstrapping_of_Corpus_Annotations_and_Entity_Types.html">110 emnlp-2013-Joint Bootstrapping of Corpus Annotations and Entity Types</a></p>

<p>Author: Ann Irvine ; Chris Quirk ; Hal Daume III</p><p>Abstract: When using a machine translation (MT) model trained on OLD-domain parallel data to translate NEW-domain text, one major challenge is the large number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and new-translation-sense words. We present a method to identify new translations of both known and unknown source language words that uses NEW-domain comparable document pairs. Starting with a joint distribution of source-target word pairs derived from the OLD-domain parallel corpus, our method recovers a new joint distribution that matches the marginal distributions of the NEW-domain comparable document pairs, while minimizing the divergence from the OLD-domain distribution. Adding learned translations to our French-English MT model results in gains of about 2 BLEU points over strong baselines.</p><p>6 0.15350822 <a title="54-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-With_Blinkers_on%3A_Robust_Prediction_of_Eye_Movements_across_Readers.html">203 emnlp-2013-With Blinkers on: Robust Prediction of Eye Movements across Readers</a></p>

<p>Author: Ming Tan ; Tian Xia ; Shaojun Wang ; Bowen Zhou</p><p>Abstract: MIRA based tuning methods have been widely used in statistical machine translation (SMT) system with a large number of features. Since the corpus-level BLEU is not decomposable, these MIRA approaches usually define a variety of heuristic-driven sentencelevel BLEUs in their model losses. Instead, we present a new MIRA method, which employs an exact corpus-level BLEU to compute the model loss. Our method is simpler in implementation. Experiments on Chinese-toEnglish translation show its effectiveness over two state-of-the-art MIRA implementations.</p><p>3 0.53461087 <a title="54-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Detection_of_Product_Comparisons_-_How_Far_Does_an_Out-of-the-Box_Semantic_Role_Labeling_System_Take_You%3F.html">62 emnlp-2013-Detection of Product Comparisons - How Far Does an Out-of-the-Box Semantic Role Labeling System Take You?</a></p>
<p>Author: Wiltrud Kessler ; Jonas Kuhn</p><p>Abstract: This short paper presents a pilot study investigating the training of a standard Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) system on product reviews for the new task of detecting comparisons. An (opinionated) comparison consists of a comparative “predicate” and up to three “arguments”: the entity evaluated positively, the entity evaluated negatively, and the aspect under which the comparison is made. In user-generated product reviews, the “predicate” and “arguments” are expressed in highly heterogeneous ways; but since the elements are textually annotated in existing datasets, SRL is technically applicable. We address the interesting question how well training an outof-the-box SRL model works for English data. We observe that even without any feature engineering or other major adaptions to our task, the system outperforms a reasonable heuristic baseline in all steps (predicate identification, argument identification and argument classification) and in three different datasets.</p><p>4 0.50161463 <a title="54-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Building_Event_Threads_out_of_Multiple_News_Articles.html">41 emnlp-2013-Building Event Threads out of Multiple News Articles</a></p>
<p>Author: Xavier Tannier ; Veronique Moriceau</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach for building multidocument event threads from a large corpus of newswire articles. An event thread is basically a succession of events belonging to the same story. It helps the reader to contextualize the information contained in a single article, by navigating backward or forward in the thread from this article. A specific effort is also made on the detection of reactions to a particular event. In order to build these event threads, we use a cascade of classifiers and other modules, taking advantage of the redundancy of information in the newswire corpus. We also share interesting comments concerning our manual annotation procedure for building a training and testing set1.</p><p>5 0.35171035 <a title="54-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Log-Linear_Model_for_Unsupervised_Text_Normalization.html">9 emnlp-2013-A Log-Linear Model for Unsupervised Text Normalization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Yang ; Jacob Eisenstein</p><p>Abstract: We present a unified unsupervised statistical model for text normalization. The relationship between standard and non-standard tokens is characterized by a log-linear model, permitting arbitrary features. The weights of these features are trained in a maximumlikelihood framework, employing a novel sequential Monte Carlo training algorithm to overcome the large label space, which would be impractical for traditional dynamic programming solutions. This model is implemented in a normalization system called UNLOL, which achieves the best known results on two normalization datasets, outperforming more complex systems. We use the output of UNLOL to automatically normalize a large corpus of social media text, revealing a set of coherent orthographic styles that underlie online language variation.</p><p>6 0.35128486 <a title="54-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Max-Margin_Synchronous_Grammar_Induction_for_Machine_Translation.html">127 emnlp-2013-Max-Margin Synchronous Grammar Induction for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Qiming Diao ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of social media, Twitter has become one of the most widely adopted platforms for people to post short and instant message. On the one hand, people tweets about their daily lives, and on the other hand, when major events happen, people also follow and tweet about them. Moreover, people’s posting behaviors on events are often closely tied to their personal interests. In this paper, we try to model topics, events and users on Twitter in a unified way. We propose a model which combines an LDA-like topic model and the Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Process to capture topics and events. We further propose a duration-based regularization component to find bursty events. We also propose to use event-topic affinity vectors to model the asso- . ciation between events and topics. Our experiments shows that our model can accurately identify meaningful events and the event-topic affinity vectors are effective for event recommendation and grouping events by topics.</p><p>3 0.093703955 <a title="131-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Opinion_Target_Extraction_in_Chinese_Microblogs.html">47 emnlp-2013-Collective Opinion Target Extraction in Chinese Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinjie Zhou ; Xiaojun Wan ; Jianguo Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Microblog messages pose severe challenges for current sentiment analysis techniques due to some inherent characteristics such as the length limit and informal writing style. In this paper, we study the problem of extracting opinion targets of Chinese microblog messages. Such fine-grained word-level task has not been well investigated in microblogs yet. We propose an unsupervised label propagation algorithm to address the problem. The opinion targets of all messages in a topic are collectively extracted based on the assumption that similar messages may focus on similar opinion targets. Topics in microblogs are identified by hashtags or using clustering algorithms. Experimental results on Chinese microblogs show the effectiveness of our framework and algorithms.</p><p>4 0.0907837 <a title="131-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised_Feature_Transformation_for_Dependency_Parsing.html">168 emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised Feature Transformation for Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenliang Chen ; Min Zhang ; Yue Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In current dependency parsing models, conventional features (i.e. base features) defined over surface words and part-of-speech tags in a relatively high-dimensional feature space may suffer from the data sparseness problem and thus exhibit less discriminative power on unseen data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach to addressing the problem by transforming the base features into high-level features (i.e. meta features) with the help of a large amount of automatically parsed data. The meta features are used together with base features in our final parser. Our studies indicate that our proposed approach is very effective in processing unseen data and features. Experiments on Chinese and English data sets show that the final parser achieves the best-reported accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known parsers on the English data.</p><p>5 0.085551016 <a title="131-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Is_Twitter_A_Better_Corpus_for_Measuring_Sentiment_Similarity%3F.html">109 emnlp-2013-Is Twitter A Better Corpus for Measuring Sentiment Similarity?</a></p>
<p>Author: Shi Feng ; Le Zhang ; Binyang Li ; Daling Wang ; Ge Yu ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of the corpus-based method for classifying the word’s sentiment polarity. However, no work is done for comparing different corpora in the polarity classification task. Nowadays, Twitter has aggregated huge amount of data that are full of people’s sentiments. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the performance of different corpora in sentiment similarity measurement, which is the fundamental task for word polarity classification. Experiment results show that the Twitter data can achieve a much better performance than the Google, Web1T and Wikipedia based methods.</p><p>6 0.083586112 <a title="131-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Identifying_Web_Search_Query_Reformulation_using_Concept_based_Matching.html">97 emnlp-2013-Identifying Web Search Query Reformulation using Concept based Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Roy Schwartz ; Oren Tsur ; Ari Rappoport ; Moshe Koppel</p><p>Abstract: Work on authorship attribution has traditionally focused on long texts. In this work, we tackle the question of whether the author of a very short text can be successfully identified. We use Twitter as an experimental testbed. We introduce the concept of an author’s unique “signature”, and show that such signatures are typical of many authors when writing very short texts. We also present a new authorship attribution feature (“flexible patterns”) and demonstrate a significant improvement over our baselines. Our results show that the author of a single tweet can be identified with good accuracy in an array of flavors of the authorship attribution task.</p><p>4 0.42887095 <a title="131-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Simulating_Early-Termination_Search_for_Verbose_Spoken_Queries.html">173 emnlp-2013-Simulating Early-Termination Search for Verbose Spoken Queries</a></p>
<p>Author: Jerome White ; Douglas W. Oard ; Nitendra Rajput ; Marion Zalk</p><p>Abstract: Building search engines that can respond to spoken queries with spoken content requires that the system not just be able to find useful responses, but also that it know when it has heard enough about what the user wants to be able to do so. This paper describes a simulation study with queries spoken by non-native speakers that suggests that indicates that finding relevant content is often possible within a half minute, and that combining features based on automatically recognized words with features designed for automated prediction of query difficulty can serve as a useful basis for predicting when that useful content has been found.</p><p>5 0.40683484 <a title="131-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Rule-Based_Information_Extraction_is_Dead%21_Long_Live_Rule-Based_Information_Extraction_Systems%21.html">161 emnlp-2013-Rule-Based Information Extraction is Dead!

<p>Author: Laura Chiticariu ; Yunyao Li ; Frederick R. Reiss</p><p>Abstract: The rise of “Big Data” analytics over unstructured text has led to renewed interest in information extraction (IE). We surveyed the landscape ofIE technologies and identified a major disconnect between industry and academia: while rule-based IE dominates the commercial world, it is widely regarded as dead-end technology by the academia. We believe the disconnect stems from the way in which the two communities measure the benefits and costs of IE, as well as academia’s perception that rulebased IE is devoid of research challenges. We make a case for the importance of rule-based IE to industry practitioners. We then lay out a research agenda in advancing the state-of-theart in rule-based IE systems which we believe has the potential to bridge the gap between academic research and industry practice.</p><p>6 0.39520064 <a title="131-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Multiple_Sources_for_Open-Domain_Hypernym_Discovery.html">79 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Multiple Sources for Open-Domain Hypernym Discovery</a></p>

<p>Author: Anais Cadilhac ; Nicholas Asher ; Farah Benamara ; Alex Lascarides</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a method that predicts which trades players execute during a winlose game. Our method uses data collected from chat negotiations of the game The Settlers of Catan and exploits the conversation to construct dynamically a partial model of each player’s preferences. This in turn yields equilibrium trading moves via principles from game theory. We compare our method against four baselines and show that tracking how preferences evolve through the dialogue and reasoning about equilibrium moves are both crucial to success.</p><p>3 0.58095133 <a title="131-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Assembling_the_Kazakh_Language_Corpus.html">26 emnlp-2013-Assembling the Kazakh Language Corpus</a></p>
<p>Author: Olzhas Makhambetov ; Aibek Makazhanov ; Zhandos Yessenbayev ; Bakhyt Matkarimov ; Islam Sabyrgaliyev ; Anuar Sharafudinov</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents the Kazakh Language Corpus (KLC), which is one of the first attempts made within a local research community to assemble a Kazakh corpus. KLC is designed to be a large scale corpus containing over 135 million words and conveying five stylistic genres: literary, publicistic, official, scientific and informal. Along with its primary part KLC comprises such parts as: (i) annotated sub-corpus, containing segmented documents encoded in the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) that marks complete morphological, syntactic, and structural characteristics of texts; (ii) as well as a sub-corpus with the annotated speech data. KLC has a web-based corpus management system that helps to navigate the data and retrieve necessary information. KLC is also open for contributors, who are willing to make suggestions, donate texts and help with annotation of existing materials.</p><p>4 0.42912179 <a title="131-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Domain_Knowledge_in_Aspect_Extraction.html">77 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Aspect Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiyuan Chen ; Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu ; Meichun Hsu ; Malu Castellanos ; Riddhiman Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical models have been used for the task. However, such models without any domain knowledge often produce aspects that are not interpretable in applications. To tackle the issue, some knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which allow the user to input some prior domain knowledge to generate coherent aspects. However, existing knowledge-based topic models have several major shortcomings, e.g., little work has been done to incorporate the cannot-link type of knowledge or to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that MCLDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models markedly.</p><p>5 0.42882806 <a title="131-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Personal_Profile_Summarization_with_Social_Networks.html">48 emnlp-2013-Collective Personal Profile Summarization with Social Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>6 0.428267 <a title="131-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Semantic_Parsing_on_Freebase_from_Question-Answer_Pairs.html">166 emnlp-2013-Semantic Parsing on Freebase from Question-Answer Pairs</a></p>

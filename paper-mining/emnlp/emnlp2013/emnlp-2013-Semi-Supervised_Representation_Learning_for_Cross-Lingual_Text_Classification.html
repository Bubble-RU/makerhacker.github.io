<p>Author: Min Xiao ; Feipeng Zhao ; Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation has been popularly studied on exploiting labeled information from a source domain to learn a prediction model in a target domain. In this paper, we develop a novel representation learning approach to address domain adaptation for text classification with automatically induced discriminative latent features, which are generalizable across domains while informative to the prediction task. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical multinomial Naive Bayes model with latent variables to conduct supervised word clustering on labeled documents from both source and target domains, and then use the produced cluster distribution of each word as its latent feature representation for domain adaptation. We train this latent graphical model us- ing a simple expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We empirically evaluate the proposed method with both cross-domain document categorization tasks on Reuters-21578 dataset and cross-domain sentiment classification tasks on Amazon product review dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance compared with alternative methods.</p><p>3 0.19383276 <a title="169-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Open_Domain_Targeted_Sentiment.html">143 emnlp-2013-Open Domain Targeted Sentiment</a></p>
<p>Author: Margaret Mitchell ; Jacqui Aguilar ; Theresa Wilson ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to sentiment analysis for a low resource setting. The intuition behind this work is that sentiment expressed towards an entity, targeted sentiment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment expressed across the entity. This representation allows us to model sentiment detection as a sequence tagging problem, jointly discovering people and organizations along with whether there is sentiment directed towards them. We compare performance in both Spanish and English on microblog data, using only a sentiment lexicon as an external resource. By leveraging linguisticallyinformed features within conditional random fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empirical risk, our best models in Spanish significantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach around 90% accuracy on the combined task of named entity recognition and sentiment prediction. Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.</p><p>4 0.1891059 <a title="169-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Bilingual_Word_Embeddings_for_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation.html">38 emnlp-2013-Bilingual Word Embeddings for Phrase-Based Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Will Y. Zou ; Richard Socher ; Daniel Cer ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We introduce bilingual word embeddings: semantic embeddings associated across two languages in the context of neural language models. We propose a method to learn bilingual embeddings from a large unlabeled corpus, while utilizing MT word alignments to constrain translational equivalence. The new embeddings significantly out-perform baselines in word semantic similarity. A single semantic similarity feature induced with bilingual embeddings adds near half a BLEU point to the results of NIST08 Chinese-English machine translation task.</p><p>5 0.16274484 <a title="169-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Building_Specialized_Bilingual_Lexicons_Using_Large_Scale_Background_Knowledge.html">42 emnlp-2013-Building Specialized Bilingual Lexicons Using Large Scale Background Knowledge</a></p>
<p>Author: Dhouha Bouamor ; Adrian Popescu ; Nasredine Semmar ; Pierre Zweigenbaum</p><p>Abstract: Bilingual lexicons are central components of machine translation and cross-lingual information retrieval systems. Their manual construction requires strong expertise in both languages involved and is a costly process. Several automatic methods were proposed as an alternative but they often rely on resources available in a limited number of languages and their performances are still far behind the quality of manual translations. We introduce a novel approach to the creation of specific domain bilingual lexicon that relies on Wikipedia. This massively multilingual encyclopedia makes it possible to create lexicons for a large number of language pairs. Wikipedia is used to extract domains in each language, to link domains between languages and to create generic translation dictionaries. The approach is tested on four specialized domains and is compared to three state of the art approaches using two language pairs: FrenchEnglish and Romanian-English. The newly introduced method compares favorably to existing methods in all configurations tested.</p><p>6 0.1620595 <a title="169-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Monolingual_Marginal_Matching_for_Translation_Model_Adaptation.html">135 emnlp-2013-Monolingual Marginal Matching for Translation Model Adaptation</a></p>

Multi-Domain learning (MDL) assumes that the domain labels in the dataset are known. However, when there are multiple metadata at- tributes available, it is not always straightforward to select a single best attribute for domain partition, and it is possible that combining more than one metadata attributes (including continuous attributes) can lead to better MDL performance. In this work, we propose an automatic domain partitioning approach that aims at providing better domain identities for MDL. We use a supervised clustering approach that learns the domain distance between data instances , and then cluster the data into better domains for MDL. Our experiment on real multi-domain datasets shows that using our automatically generated domain partition improves over popular MDL methods.</p><p>4 0.68571568 <a title="169-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Multi-Domain_Adaptation_for_SMT_Using_Multi-Task_Learning.html">136 emnlp-2013-Multi-Domain Adaptation for SMT Using Multi-Task Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Cui ; Xilun Chen ; Dongdong Zhang ; Shujie Liu ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation for SMT usually adapts models to an individual specific domain. However, it often lacks some correlation among different domains where common knowledge could be shared to improve the overall translation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain adaptation approach for SMT using Multi-Task Learning (MTL), with in-domain models tailored for each specific domain and a general-domain model shared by different domains. The parameters of these models are tuned jointly via MTL so that they can learn general knowledge more accurately and exploit domain knowledge better. Our experiments on a largescale English-to-Chinese translation task validate that the MTL-based adaptation approach significantly and consistently improves the translation quality compared to a non-adapted baseline. Furthermore, it also outperforms the individual adaptation of each specific domain.</p><p>5 0.67848349 <a title="169-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Building_Specialized_Bilingual_Lexicons_Using_Large_Scale_Background_Knowledge.html">42 emnlp-2013-Building Specialized Bilingual Lexicons Using Large Scale Background Knowledge</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>4 0.71481502 <a title="169-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Max-Margin_Synchronous_Grammar_Induction_for_Machine_Translation.html">127 emnlp-2013-Max-Margin Synchronous Grammar Induction for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Traditional synchronous grammar induction estimates parameters by maximizing likelihood, which only has a loose relation to translation quality. Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>5 0.71317929 <a title="169-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Deep_Models_for_Semantic_Compositionality_Over_a_Sentiment_Treebank.html">158 emnlp-2013-Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Alex Perelygin ; Jean Wu ; Jason Chuang ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Semantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning of longer phrases in a principled way. Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.</p><p>6 0.7119348 <a title="169-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Harvesting_Parallel_News_Streams_to_Generate_Paraphrases_of_Event_Relations.html">93 emnlp-2013-Harvesting Parallel News Streams to Generate Paraphrases of Event Relations</a></p>

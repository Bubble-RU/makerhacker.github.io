</p><p>3 Experiments show the approach is able to learn accurate models, which generate over 87% of the expressions people used. [sent-7, score-0.319]
</p><p>4 We focus on the task of referring expression generation (REG), where the goal is to produce an expression which uniquely identifies a pre-defined object or set of objects in an environment. [sent-11, score-0.932]
</p><p>5 Fig1914 ure 1 shows referring expressions provided by human subjects for a set of objects (Figure 1a), demonstrating variation in utterances (Figure 1b) and their corresponding meaning representations (Figure 1c). [sent-13, score-0.744]
</p><p>6 With these goals in mind, we cast REG as a density estimation problem, where the goal is to learn a distribution over logical forms. [sent-16, score-0.49]
</p><p>7 For a target set of objects, the number of logical forms that can be used to describe it grows combinatorially with the number of observable properties, such as color and shape. [sent-18, score-0.527]
</p><p>8 We use a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, where the key challenge is the need to compute feature expectations over all possible logical forms. [sent-22, score-0.442]

</p><p>11 We extend these techniques by modeling the types of plurality and coordination that are prominent in expressions which refer to sets. [sent-99, score-0.483]
</p><p>12 We also present a new corpus for the task of referring expression generation. [sent-100, score-0.395]
</p><p>13 Experiments demonstrate highly accurate learned models, able to generate over 87% of the expressions people used. [sent-103, score-0.357]
</p><p>14 2  Related Work  Referring expression generation has been extensively studied in the natural language generation community, dating as far back as SHRDLU (Winograd, 1972). [sent-106, score-0.303]
</p><p>15 Most work has built on variations of the Incremental Algorithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995), a deterministic algorithm for naming single objects that constructs conjunctive logical expressions. [sent-107, score-0.65]
</p><p>16 Different approaches have been proposed for generating referring expressions for sets of objects. [sent-111, score-0.577]
</p><p>17 Further work attempted to resolve the unnaturally long expressions which could be generated by this approach (Gardent, 2002; Horacek, 2004; Gatt and van Deemter, 2007). [sent-113, score-0.403]
</p><p>18 Much recent work in REG has identified the importance of modeling the variation observed in human-generated referring expressions (Viethen and Dale, 2010; Viethen et al. [sent-120, score-0.541]
</p><p>19 To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first learned probabilistic model for referring expressions defining sets, and is the first effort to treat REG as a density estimation problem. [sent-127, score-0.634]
</p><p>20 However, most approaches to this problem output bags of con-  cepts, while we construct full logical expressions, 1916 allowing our approach to capture complex relations between attributes. [sent-132, score-0.401]
</p><p>21 Our use of logical forms follows this line of work, while extending it to handle plurality and coordination, as described in Section 4. [sent-138, score-0.454]
</p><p>22 In addition, lambda calculus was shown to enable effective natural language generation from logical forms (White and Rajkumar, 2009; Lu and Ng, 2011). [sent-140, score-0.564]

</p><p>27 These sentences are automatically labelled with logical forms with a learned semantic parser, providing a stand-in for manually labeled data (see Section 7). [sent-174, score-0.439]
</p><p>28 Previous approaches would map this sentence to the same logical expression as the singular “The red cube”, ignoring the semantic distinction encoded by the plural. [sent-185, score-0.703]

</p><p>30 red(x) will be true for all sets which contain only objects for which the value red is true. [sent-192, score-0.368]
</p><p>31 We define semantic plurality in terms of two special collective predicates: sg for singular and plu for plural. [sent-197, score-0.399]

</p><p>34 Finally, the indefinite determiner “a” is modeled with the logical constant A, which picks a singleton set by implicitly introducing an epxiciskste anti sailn quantifier (Artzi alnicdZettlemoyer, 2013b). [sent-213, score-0.44]
</p><p>35 2  Visual Domain  Objects in our scenes are labeled with attribute values for four attribute types: color (7 values, such as red, green), shape (9 values, such as cube, sphere), type (16 values, such as broccoli, apple) and a special ob j ect property, which is true for all objects.

</p><p>39 To avoid this explosion, we limit the type and complexity of the logical expressions that are included in Z. [sent-242, score-0.784]

</p><p>59 Complexity Features We use a single realnumbered feature to account for the complexity of the logical form. [sent-346, score-0.465]
</p><p>60 We define the complexity of a logical form to be the number of logical constants used. [sent-347, score-0.866]
</p><p>61 This feature is only used in the global model, since the pruning model always considers logical expressions of fixed complexity. [sent-349, score-0.898]

</p><p>75 This metric is quite strict; small differences in the estimated probabilities over a large number of logical expressions can result in a large error, even if the relative ordering is quite similar. [sent-453, score-0.72]
</p><p>76 Therefore, we report the percentage of observed logical expressions which the model produces, either giving credit multiple times for duplicates (%dup) or counting each unique logical expression in a scene once (%uniq). [sent-454, score-1.36]
</p><p>77 Put another way, %dup counts logical expression tokens, whereas %uniq counts types. [sent-455, score-0.574]

</p><p>86 The bottom section shows the predicted probability of the three expressions which were not in the top 10 of the predicted distribution. [sent-487, score-0.385]
</p><p>87 Much of the error can be attributed to probability mass assigned to logical expressions which, although not observed in our test data, are reasonable referring expressions. [sent-495, score-0.942]
</p><p>88 This might be due to the fact that our estimate of the empirical distribution comes from a fairly small sample  (20), or other factors which we do not model that make these expressions less likely. [sent-496, score-0.353]
</p><p>89 We demonstrated that we can learn to produce distributions over logical referring expressions using a globally normalized model. [sent-498, score-1.03]

<p>Author: Rui Fang ; Changsong Liu ; Lanbo She ; Joyce Y. Chai</p><p>Abstract: In situated dialogue, humans and agents have mismatched capabilities of perceiving the shared environment. Their representations of the shared world are misaligned. Thus referring expression generation (REG) will need to take this discrepancy into consideration. To address this issue, we developed a hypergraph-based approach to account for group-based spatial relations and uncertainties in perceiving the environment. Our empirical results have shown that this approach outperforms a previous graph-based approach with an absolute gain of 9%. However, while these graph-based approaches perform effectively when the agent has perfect knowledge or perception of the environment (e.g., 84%), they perform rather poorly when the agent has imperfect perception of the environment (e.g., 45%). This big performance gap calls for new solutions to REG that can mediate a shared perceptual basis in situated dialogue.</p><p>3 0.28293455 <a title="119-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Scaling_Semantic_Parsers_with_On-the-Fly_Ontology_Matching.html">164 emnlp-2013-Scaling Semantic Parsers with On-the-Fly Ontology Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Eunsol Choi ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We consider the challenge of learning semantic parsers that scale to large, open-domain problems, such as question answering with Freebase. In such settings, the sentences cover a wide variety of topics and include many phrases whose meaning is difficult to represent in a fixed target ontology. For example, even simple phrases such as ‘daughter’ and ‘number of people living in’ cannot be directly represented in Freebase, whose ontology instead encodes facts about gender, parenthood, and population. In this paper, we introduce a new semantic parsing approach that learns to resolve such ontological mismatches. The parser is learned from question-answer pairs, uses a probabilistic CCG to build linguistically motivated logicalform meaning representations, and includes an ontology matching model that adapts the output logical forms for each target ontology. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark semantic parsing datasets, including a nine point accuracy improvement on a recent Freebase QA corpus.</p><p>4 0.26043057 <a title="119-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Semantic_Parsing_on_Freebase_from_Question-Answer_Pairs.html">166 emnlp-2013-Semantic Parsing on Freebase from Question-Answer Pairs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Andrew Chou ; Roy Frostig ; Percy Liang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we train a semantic parser that scales up to Freebase. Instead of relying on annotated logical forms, which is especially expensive to obtain at large scale, we learn from question-answer pairs. The main challenge in this setting is narrowing down the huge number of possible logical predicates for a given question. We tackle this problem in two ways: First, we build a coarse mapping from phrases to predicates using a knowledge base and a large text corpus. Second, we use a bridging operation to generate additional predicates based on neighboring predicates. On the dataset ofCai and Yates (2013), despite not having annotated logical forms, our system outperforms their state-of-the-art parser. Additionally, we collected a more realistic and challenging dataset of question-answer pairs and improves over a natural baseline.</p><p>5 0.16600871 <a title="119-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Unsupervised_Induction_of_Cross-Lingual_Semantic_Relations.html">193 emnlp-2013-Unsupervised Induction of Cross-Lingual Semantic Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Mike Lewis ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: Creating a language-independent meaning representation would benefit many crosslingual NLP tasks. We introduce the first unsupervised approach to this problem, learning clusters of semantically equivalent English and French relations between referring expressions, based on their named-entity arguments in large monolingual corpora. The clusters can be used as language-independent semantic relations, by mapping clustered expressions in different languages onto the same relation. Our approach needs no parallel text for training, but outperforms a baseline that uses machine translation on a cross-lingual question answering task. We also show how to use the semantics to improve the accuracy of machine translation, by using it in a simple reranker.</p><p>6 0.12796071 <a title="119-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Language_Models_for_Visual_Recognition.html">78 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Language Models for Visual Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicholas FitzGerald ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to referring expression generation, casting it as a density estimation problem where the goal is to learn distributions over logical expressions identifying sets of objects in the world. Despite an extremely large space of possible expressions, we demonstrate effective learning of a globally normalized log-linear distribution. This learning is enabled by a new, multi-stage approximate inference technique that uses a pruning model to construct only the most likely logical forms. We train and evaluate the approach on a new corpus of references to sets of visual objects. Experiments show the approach is able to learn accurate models, which generate over 87% of the expressions people used.

<p>Author: Rui Fang ; Changsong Liu ; Lanbo She ; Joyce Y. Chai</p><p>Abstract: In situated dialogue, humans and agents have mismatched capabilities of perceiving the shared environment. Their representations of the shared world are misaligned. Thus referring expression generation (REG) will need to take this discrepancy into consideration. To address this issue, we developed a hypergraph-based approach to account for group-based spatial relations and uncertainties in perceiving the environment. Our empirical results have shown that this approach outperforms a previous graph-based approach with an absolute gain of 9%. However, while these graph-based approaches perform effectively when the agent has perfect knowledge or perception of the environment (e.g., 84%), they perform rather poorly when the agent has imperfect perception of the environment (e.g., 45%). This big performance gap calls for new solutions to REG that can mediate a shared perceptual basis in situated dialogue.</p><p>3 0.73250884 <a title="119-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Scaling_Semantic_Parsers_with_On-the-Fly_Ontology_Matching.html">164 emnlp-2013-Scaling Semantic Parsers with On-the-Fly Ontology Matching</a></p>

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have previously been used to accelerate CKY chart evaluation, but gains over CPU parsers were modest. In this paper, we describe a collection of new techniques that enable chart evaluation at close to the GPU’s practical maximum speed (a Teraflop), or around a half-trillion rule evaluations per second. Net parser performance on a 4-GPU system is over 1 thousand length30 sentences/second (1 trillion rules/sec), and 400 general sentences/second for the Berkeley Parser Grammar. The techniques we introduce include grammar compilation, recursive symbol blocking, and cache-sharing.</p><p>2 0.83659261 <a title="119-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Animacy_Detection_with_Voting_Models.html">23 emnlp-2013-Animacy Detection with Voting Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiao Cheng ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Wikification, commonly referred to as Disambiguation to Wikipedia (D2W), is the task of identifying concepts and entities in text and disambiguating them into the most specific corresponding Wikipedia pages. Previous approaches to D2W focused on the use of local and global statistics over the given text, Wikipedia articles and its link structures, to evaluate context compatibility among a list of probable candidates. However, these methods fail (often, embarrassingly), when some level of text understanding is needed to support Wikification. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to Wikification by incorporating, along with statistical methods, richer relational analysis of the text. We provide an extensible, efficient and modular Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of Wikification that incorporates the entity-relation inference problem, and show that the ability to identify relations in text helps both candi- date generation and ranking Wikipedia titles considerably. Our results show significant improvements in both Wikification and the TAC Entity Linking task.</p><p>3 0.18571348 <a title="69-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Bootstrapping_of_Corpus_Annotations_and_Entity_Types.html">110 emnlp-2013-Joint Bootstrapping of Corpus Annotations and Entity Types</a></p>
<p>Author: Hrushikesh Mohapatra ; Siddhanth Jain ; Soumen Chakrabarti</p><p>Abstract: Web search can be enhanced in powerful ways if token spans in Web text are annotated with disambiguated entities from large catalogs like Freebase. Entity annotators need to be trained on sample mention snippets. Wikipedia entities and annotated pages offer high-quality labeled data for training and evaluation. Unfortunately, Wikipedia features only one-ninth the number of entities as Freebase, and these are a highly biased sample of well-connected, frequently mentioned “head” entities. To bring hope to “tail” entities, we broaden our goal to a second task: assigning types to entities in Freebase but not Wikipedia. The two tasks are synergistic: knowing the types of unfamiliar entities helps disambiguate mentions, and words in mention contexts help assign types to entities. We present TMI, a bipartite graphical model for joint type-mention inference. TMI attempts no schema integration or entity resolution, but exploits the above-mentioned synergy. In experiments involving 780,000 people in Wikipedia, 2.3 million people in Freebase, 700 million Web pages, and over 20 professional editors, TMI shows considerable annotation accuracy improvement (e.g., 70%) compared to baselines (e.g., 46%), especially for “tail” and emerging entities. We also compare with Google’s recent annotations of the same corpus with Freebase entities, and report considerable improvements within the people domain.</p><p>4 0.15288889 <a title="69-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Microblog_Entity_Linking_by_Leveraging_Extra_Posts.html">130 emnlp-2013-Microblog Entity Linking by Leveraging Extra Posts</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhang Guo ; Bing Qin ; Ting Liu ; Sheng Li</p><p>Abstract: Linking name mentions in microblog posts to a knowledge base, namely microblog entity linking, is useful for text mining tasks on microblog. Entity linking in long text has been well studied in previous works. However few work has focused on short text such as microblog post. Microblog posts are short and noisy. Previous method can extract few features from the post context. In this paper we propose to use extra posts for the microblog entity linking task. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves the linking accuracy over traditional methods by 8.3% and 7.5% respectively.</p><p>5 0.14030714 <a title="69-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Hierarchical_Entity-Based_Approach_to_Structuralize_User_Generated_Content_in_Social_Media%3A_A_Case_of_Yahoo%21_Answers.html">7 emnlp-2013-A Hierarchical Entity-Based Approach to Structuralize User Generated Content in Social Media: A Case of Yahoo!

<p>Author: Baichuan Li ; Jing Liu ; Chin-Yew Lin ; Irwin King ; Michael R. Lyu</p><p>Abstract: Social media like forums and microblogs have accumulated a huge amount of user generated content (UGC) containing human knowledge. Currently, most of UGC is listed as a whole or in pre-defined categories. This “list-based” approach is simple, but hinders users from browsing and learning knowledge of certain topics effectively. To address this problem, we propose a hierarchical entity-based approach for structuralizing UGC in social media. By using a large-scale entity repository, we design a three-step framework to organize UGC in a novel hierarchical structure called “cluster entity tree (CET)”. With Yahoo! Answers as a test case, we conduct experiments and the results show the effectiveness of our framework in constructing CET. We further evaluate the performance of CET on UGC organization in both user and system aspects. From a user aspect, our user study demonstrates that, with CET-based structure, users perform significantly better in knowledge learning than using traditional list-based approach. From a system aspect, CET substantially boosts the performance of two information retrieval models (i.e., vector space model and query likelihood language model).</p><p>6 0.13174461 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Application_of_Localized_Similarity_for_Web_Documents.html">24 emnlp-2013-Application of Localized Similarity for Web Documents</a></p>

<p>Author: Ruiji Fu ; Bing Qin ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: Hypernym discovery aims to extract such noun pairs that one noun is a hypernym of the other. Most previous methods are based on lexical patterns but perform badly on opendomain data. Other work extracts hypernym relations from encyclopedias but has limited coverage. This paper proposes a simple yet effective distant supervision framework for Chinese open-domain hypernym discovery. Given an entity name, we try to discover its hypernyms by leveraging knowledge from multiple sources, i.e., search engine results, encyclopedias, and morphology of the entity name. First, we extract candidate hypernyms from the above sources. Then, we apply a statistical ranking model to select correct hypernyms. A set of novel features is proposed for the rank- ing model. We also present a heuristic strategy to build a large-scale noisy training data for the model without human annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset.</p><p>4 0.82528055 <a title="69-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Bootstrapping_of_Corpus_Annotations_and_Entity_Types.html">110 emnlp-2013-Joint Bootstrapping of Corpus Annotations and Entity Types</a></p>

Here, we consider an automated method of categorizing errors in the output of a coreference system into intuitive underlying error types.

<p>Author: John Canny ; David Hall ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Constituency parsing with rich grammars remains a computational challenge. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have previously been used to accelerate CKY chart evaluation, but gains over CPU parsers were modest. In this paper, we describe a collection of new techniques that enable chart evaluation at close to the GPU’s practical maximum speed (a Teraflop), or around a half-trillion rule evaluations per second. Net parser performance on a 4-GPU system is over 1 thousand length30 sentences/second (1 trillion rules/sec), and 400 general sentences/second for the Berkeley Parser Grammar. The techniques we introduce include grammar compilation, recursive symbol blocking, and cache-sharing.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.89252442 <a title="69-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Collective_Entity_Linking_with_Stacking.html">69 emnlp-2013-Efficient Collective Entity Linking with Stacking</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengyan He ; Shujie Liu ; Yang Song ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Houfeng Wang</p><p>Abstract: Entity disambiguation works by linking ambiguous mentions in text to their corresponding real-world entities in knowledge base. Recent collective disambiguation methods enforce coherence among contextual decisions at the cost of non-trivial inference processes. We propose a fast collective disambiguation approach based on stacking. First, we train a local predictor g0 with learning to rank as base learner, to generate initial ranking list of candidates. Second, top k candidates of related instances are searched for constructing expressive global coherence features. A global predictor g1 is trained in the augmented feature space and stacking is employed to tackle the train/test mismatch problem. The proposed method is fast and easy to implement. Experiments show its effectiveness over various algorithms on several public datasets. By learning a rich semantic relatedness measure be- . tween entity categories and context document, performance is further improved.</p><p>4 0.85451651 <a title="69-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Using_Soft_Constraints_in_Joint_Inference_for_Clinical_Concept_Recognition.html">198 emnlp-2013-Using Soft Constraints in Joint Inference for Clinical Concept Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Prateek Jindal ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces IQPs (Integer Quadratic Programs) as a way to model joint inference for the task of concept recognition in clinical domain. IQPs make it possible to easily incorporate soft constraints in the optimization framework and still support exact global inference. We show that soft constraints give statistically significant performance improvements when compared to hard constraints.</p><p>5 0.77809215 <a title="69-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Zero_Pronouns_to_Improve_Chinese_Coreference_Resolution.html">80 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Zero Pronouns to Improve Chinese Coreference Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Fang Kong ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Coreference resolution plays a critical role in discourse analysis. This paper focuses on exploiting zero pronouns to improve Chinese coreference resolution. In particular, a simplified semantic role labeling framework is proposed to identify clauses and to detect zero pronouns effectively, and two effective methods (refining syntactic parser and refining learning example generation) are employed to exploit zero pronouns for Chinese coreference resolution. Evaluation on the CoNLL-2012 shared task data set shows that zero pronouns can significantly improve Chinese coreference resolution.</p><p>6 0.77677721 <a title="69-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Microblog_Entity_Linking_by_Leveraging_Extra_Posts.html">130 emnlp-2013-Microblog Entity Linking by Leveraging Extra Posts</a></p>

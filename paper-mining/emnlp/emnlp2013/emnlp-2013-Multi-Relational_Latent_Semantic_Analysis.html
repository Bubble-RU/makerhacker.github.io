</p><p>7 The raw data construction in MRLSA is straightforward and similar to the document-term matrix in LSA. [sent-39, score-0.16]
</p><p>8 Each slice corresponds to the document-term matrix in the original LSA design but for a specific relation. [sent-41, score-0.2]
</p><p>9 Analogous to LSA, the whole linear transformation mapping is derived through tensor decomposition, which provides a low-rank approximation of the original tensor. [sent-42, score-0.484]
</p><p>10 As a result, previously unseen relations between two words can be discovered, and the information encoded in other relations can influence the construction of the latent representations, and thus poten-  tially improves the overall quality. [sent-43, score-0.307]

</p><p>13 However, while the words are represented by vectors as well, multiple relations between words are captured separately by matrices. [sent-73, score-0.149]
</p><p>14 For instance, morphological variations discovered from the Google n-gram corpus have been combined with information from thesauri and vector-based word relatedness models for detecting antonyms (Mohammad et al. [sent-78, score-0.188]
</p><p>15 The degree that two words having a particular relation is estimated using the same linear function of the corresponding vectors and matrix. [sent-84, score-0.149]
</p><p>16 Tensor decomposition generalizes matrix factorization and has been applied to several NLP applications recently. [sent-85, score-0.209]
</p><p>17 (2013) represented triples of question title, question content and answer as a tensor and applied 3-mode SVD to derive latent semantic representations for question matching. [sent-91, score-0.636]
</p><p>18 However, our goal of modeling different relations for lexical semantics is very different from the intended usage of tensor decomposition in the existing work. [sent-93, score-0.692]
</p><p>19 Once the matrix is constructed, the second step is to apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to W in order to derive a low-rank approximation. [sent-106, score-0.177]
</p><p>20 For instance, to compare the u-th and v-th words in the vocabulary, one can compute the cosine similarity of the u-th and v-th column vectors of X, the reconstruction matrix of W. [sent-111, score-0.198]
</p><p>21 An alternative view of using LSA is to treat the column vectors of ΣVT as a representation of the words in a new k-dimensional latent space. [sent-114, score-0.145]
</p><p>22 This comes from the observation that the inner product of every two column vectors in X is the inner product of the corresponding column vectors of ΣVT,  joyglfaudlndgsea sdnrs-01 01-0 1-0 10 0 0  Figure 2: The matrix construction of PILSA. [sent-115, score-0.284]

</p><p>24 This is due to the fact that the raw matrix representation only records the occurrences of words in documents without knowing the specific relation between the word and document. [sent-124, score-0.195]
</p><p>25 (2012) proposed a polarity inducing latent semantic analysis model recently, which we introduce next. [sent-126, score-0.146]

</p><p>27 Synonyms and antonyms of the same target word are grouped together as a “document” and a document-term matrix is constructed accordingly as done in LSA. [sent-131, score-0.253]

</p><p>29 When comparing two words using the cosine similarity (or simply inner product) of their corresponding column vectors in the matrix, the score of a synonym pair remains positive, but the score of an antonym pair becomes negative. [sent-135, score-0.263]
</p><p>30 The sign of the cosine score of the column vectors of any two words indicates whether they are close to synonyms or to antonyms and the absolute value reflects the degree of the relation. [sent-138, score-0.38]
</p><p>31 When all the column vectors are normalized to unit vectors, it can also be viewed as synonyms are clustered together and antonyms lie on the opposite sides of a unit sphere. [sent-139, score-0.331]
</p><p>32 Each slice captures a particular relation and is in the format of the document-term matrix in LSA. [sent-142, score-0.257]
</p><p>33 1  Representing Multi-Relational Data in Tensors  A tensor is simply a multi-dimensional array. [sent-150, score-0.449]
</p><p>34 In this work, we use a 3-way tensor W to encode multiple kw,o wrde r ueslaeti aon 3s-. [sent-151, score-0.449]

</p><p>39 Below we use an example to compare this construction to the raw matrix in PILSA, and discuss how it extends LSA. [sent-157, score-0.16]
</p><p>40 The raw tensor in MRLSA would then consist of two slices, W:,:,syn MandR W:,:,ant, utlod e tnhceonde c synonyms aond s antonyms of target words from a knowledge source (e. [sent-159, score-0.776]

</p><p>44 2  Tensor Decomposition  The MRLSA raw tensor encodes relations in one or more data resources, such as thesauri. [sent-172, score-0.628]
</p><p>45 In this section, we derive a low-rank approximation of the tensor to generalize the knowledge. [sent-174, score-0.484]
</p><p>46 Various tensor decomposition methods have been proposed in literature. [sent-176, score-0.56]
</p><p>47 In Tucker decomposition, a d n m tensor W is decomposed into four components G, U, V, TW. [sent-180, score-0.449]
</p><p>48 4(a) illustrates the Tucker tensor decomposition method which factors a 3-way tensor W to tFhigreuer orthogonal matrices, U, V, T, caknedr a core t edenscoorm Gp. [sent-182, score-1.031]
</p><p>49 (  X of W is defined by Wi,j,k ≈ Xi,j,k XR1 XR2  XR3  = X X X Gr1,r2,r3Ui,r1Vj,r2Tk,r3, rX1  X=1 rX2=1 rX3=1  where G is a core tensor with dimensions R1 R2 R3 arned G U, V, rTe are orthogonal mnsaitornicse Rs w×ithR d×imensions d R1, n R2, m R3, respectively. [sent-186, score-0.471]
</p><p>50 d To make the analogy to SVD clear, we rewrite the results of Tucker decomposition by performing a nmode matrix product over the core tensor G with the mmoadtriex m mTat. [sent-192, score-0.648]
</p><p>51 4(b), Then, a straightforward calculation shows that k-th slice of tensor W is approximated by W:,:,k ≈ X:,:,k  = US:,:,kVT. [sent-197, score-0.583]
</p><p>52 (1), one can observe that matrices U and V play similar roles here, and 1607 each slice of the core tensor S is analogous to Σ. [sent-200, score-0.631]
</p><p>53 Aares imn SVD, the column vectors of G:,:,kVT (capture both word and relation information) behave similarly to the column vectors of the original tensor slice W:,:,k. [sent-202, score-0.788]
</p><p>54 3 Measuring the Degrees of Word Relations In principle, the raw information in the input tensor W can be used for computing lexical similarity using th cea nco bsein ues score bc oetmwpeuetni tghe l cxoicluaml sni mveilcatroitrys for two words from the same slice of the tensor. [sent-204, score-0.688]
</p><p>55 The key role of the pivot slice is to expand the lexical coverage of the relation of interest to additional lexical entries and, for this reason, the pivot slice should be chosen to capture the equivalence of the lexical entries. [sent-206, score-0.389]
</p><p>56 In this paper, we use the synonymy relation as our pivot slice. [sent-207, score-0.139]
</p><p>57 First we consider measuring the degree of a relation rel holding between the i-th and j-th words using the raw tensor W, which can be computed as cos This measurement  ? [sent-208, score-0.738]
</p><p>58 Turning to the use of the tensor decomposition, we use a similar derivation to Eq. [sent-214, score-0.449]
</p><p>59 (3), and measure the degree of relation rel between two words by cos  ? [sent-215, score-0.184]
</p><p>60 (6)  For instance, the degree of antonymy between “joy” and “sorrow” is measured by the cosine similarity between the respective fibers cos(X:,“joy”,syn, X:,“sorrow”,ant). [sent-218, score-0.192]
</p><p>61 When encoding two opposite relations from the same source, MRLSA performs comparably to PILSA. [sent-230, score-0.186]
</p><p>62 1 Experimental Setup We construct the raw tensors to encode a particular relation in each slice based on two data sources. [sent-234, score-0.294]
</p><p>63 WordNet We use four types of relations from WordNet: synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy and hyponymy. [sent-239, score-0.144]
</p><p>64 For instance, the WordNet antonym slice contains only 46,945 nonzero entries, while the Encarta antonym slice has 129,733. [sent-242, score-0.432]
</p><p>65 com 1608 We apply a memory-efficient Tucker decomposition algorithm (Kolda and Sun, 2008) implemented in tensor toolbox v2. [sent-245, score-0.591]
</p><p>66 The largest tensor considered in this paper can be decomposed in about 3 hours using less than 4GB of memory with a commodity PC. [sent-248, score-0.449]
</p><p>67 We tune two sets of parameters using the development set: (1) the rank parameter τ in the tensor decomposition and (2) the scaling factors of different slices of the tensor. [sent-258, score-0.656]
</p><p>68 g T fahcet oerl-s ements of each slice are multiplied by the scaling factor before factorization. [sent-263, score-0.165]
</p><p>69 We modify the MATLAB code of tensor toolbox to use the built-in svd function instead of svds. [sent-277, score-0.565]
</p><p>70 RawTensor evaluates the performance of the tensor with 2 slices encoding synonyms and antonyms before decomposition (see Eq. [sent-299, score-0.887]
</p><p>71 MRLSA:Syn+Ant applies Tucker decomposition to the raw tensor and measures the degree of antonymy using Eq. [sent-301, score-0.766]
</p><p>72 MRLSA:4-layers adds hypernyms and hyponyms from WordNet; MRLSA:WordNet+Encarta consists of synonyms/antonyms from Encarta and hypernyms/hyponyms from WordNet, where the target words are aligned using the synonymy relations. [sent-306, score-0.143]
</p><p>73 corpora, Encarta and  The performance  of the MRLSA  raw  tensor is close to that of looking up the thesaurus. [sent-309, score-0.521]

</p><p>75 explicitly  After conducting  is able to  described  in  tensor decomposi-  tion, MRLSA:Syn+Ant achieves similar results to PILSA. [sent-311, score-0.449]
</p><p>76 However, the true power of MRLSA is its ability to incorporate other semantic relations to boost the performance of the target task. [sent-313, score-0.172]
</p><p>77 For example, when we add the hypernymy and hyponymy relations to the tensor, these class-inclusion relations provide a weak signal to help resolve antonymy. [sent-314, score-0.251]
</p><p>78 We suspect that this is due to the fact that antonyms typically share the same properties but only have the opposite meaning on one particular semantic dimension. [sent-315, score-0.23]
</p><p>79 For instance, the antonyms “sadness” and “happiness” are different forms of emotion. [sent-316, score-0.163]
</p><p>80 When two words are hyponyms of a target word, the likelihood that they are antonyms should thus be increased. [sent-317, score-0.228]
</p><p>81 We show that the target relations and these auxiliary semantic relations can be col1609 lected from the same data source (e. [sent-318, score-0.279]
</p><p>82 Moreover, our experiments show that adding the hypernym and hyponym layers from WordNet improves modeling antonym relations based on the Encarta thesaurus. [sent-324, score-0.215]
</p><p>83 To better understand the model, we examine the top antonyms for three question words from the GRE test. [sent-328, score-0.188]
</p><p>84 The lists below show antonyms and their MRLSA scores for each of the GRE question words as determined by the MRLSA:WordNET+Encarta model. [sent-329, score-0.188]
</p><p>85 318)  Table 2: Results of measuring the class-inclusion (is-a) relations in MaxDiff accuracy (see text for detail). [sent-359, score-0.14]
</p><p>86 RawTensor has synonym and hyponym slices and measures the degree of is-a relation using Eq. [sent-360, score-0.223]
</p><p>87 MRLSA:Syn+Hypo factors the raw tensor and judges the relation by Eq. [sent-362, score-0.578]
</p><p>88 only preserves the antonyms in the thesaurus, but also discovers additional ones, such as exacerbate and inflame for “alleviate”. [sent-369, score-0.186]
</p><p>89 Results show that even the raw tensor representation (RawTensor) performs better than WordNet lookup. [sent-391, score-0.521]
</p><p>90 We suspect that this is because the tensor representation can capture the fact that the hyponyms of a word are usually synonymous to each other. [sent-392, score-0.49]
</p><p>91 By performing Tucker decomposition on the raw Tensor, MRLSA achieves better performance. [sent-393, score-0.183]
</p><p>92 MRLSA:4-layers further leverages the information from antonyms and hypernyms and thus improves the model. [sent-394, score-0.191]
</p><p>93 Therefore, it is interesting to check if combining synonyms and antonyms from Encarta helps. [sent-396, score-0.231]
</p><p>94 Having one additional slice to capture the general term co-occurrence relation may help improve the model in this respect. [sent-422, score-0.191]
</p><p>95 MRLSA models multiple word relations by leveraging a 3-way tensor, where each slice captures one particular relation. [sent-424, score-0.241]
</p><p>96 A low-rank approximation of the tensor is then derived using a tensor decomposition. [sent-425, score-0.933]
</p><p>97 Consequently, words in the vocabulary are represented by vectors in the latent semantic space, and each relation is captured by a latent square matrix. [sent-426, score-0.336]
</p><p>98 Given two words, MRLSA not only can measure their degree of having a specific relation, but also can discover unknown relations between them. [sent-427, score-0.157]
</p><p>99 By encoding relations from both homogeneous or heterogeneous data sources, MRLSA achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmark datasets for two relations, antonymy and is-a. [sent-429, score-0.301]
</p><p>100 For instance, the knowledge encoded by MRLSA can be enriched by adding more relations from a variety of linguistic resources, including the co-occurrence relations from large cor1611 pora. [sent-431, score-0.214]

MRLSA provides an elegant approach to combining multiple relations between words by constructing a 3-way tensor. Similar to LSA, a lowrank approximation of the tensor is derived using a tensor decomposition. Each word in the vocabulary is thus represented by a vector in the latent semantic space and each relation is captured by a latent square matrix. The degree of two words having a specific relation can then be measured through simple linear algebraic operations. We demonstrate that by integrating multiple relations from both homogeneous and heterogeneous information sources, MRLSA achieves state- of-the-art performance on existing benchmark datasets for two relations, antonymy and is-a.</p><p>2 0.21276839 <a title="137-tfidf-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Prior_Disambiguation_of_Word_Tensors_for_Constructing_Sentence_Vectors.html">154 emnlp-2013-Prior Disambiguation of Word Tensors for Constructing Sentence Vectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Dimitri Kartsaklis ; Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has shown that compositionaldistributional models using element-wise operations on contextual word vectors benefit from the introduction of a prior disambiguation step. The purpose of this paper is to generalise these ideas to tensor-based models, where relational words such as verbs and adjectives are represented by linear maps (higher order tensors) acting on a number of arguments (vectors). We propose disambiguation algorithms for a number of tensor-based models, which we then test on a variety of tasks. The results show that disambiguation can provide better compositional representation even for the case of tensor-based models. Further- more, we confirm previous findings regarding the positive effect of disambiguation on vector mixture models, and we compare the effectiveness of the two approaches.</p><p>3 0.13750747 <a title="137-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Deep_Models_for_Semantic_Compositionality_Over_a_Sentiment_Treebank.html">158 emnlp-2013-Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank</a></p>

It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.</p><p>4 0.11815025 <a title="137-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Discriminative_Improvements_to_Distributional_Sentence_Similarity.html">64 emnlp-2013-Discriminative Improvements to Distributional Sentence Similarity</a></p>

The key idea is that similarity in the latent space implies semantic relatedness. We describe three ways in which labeled data can improve the accuracy of these approaches on paraphrase classification. First, we design a new discriminative term-weighting metric called TF-KLD, which outperforms TF-IDF. Next, we show that using the latent representation from matrix factorization as features in a classification algorithm substantially improves accuracy. Finally, we combine latent features with fine-grained n-gram overlap features, yielding performance that is 3% more accurate than the prior state-of-the-art.</p><p>5 0.10280725 <a title="137-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Deriving_Adjectival_Scales_from_Continuous_Space_Word_Representations.html">59 emnlp-2013-Deriving Adjectival Scales from Continuous Space Word Representations</a></p>

<p>Author: Kai-Wei Chang ; Wen-tau Yih ; Christopher Meek</p><p>Abstract: We present Multi-Relational Latent Semantic Analysis (MRLSA) which generalizes Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). MRLSA provides an elegant approach to combining multiple relations between words by constructing a 3-way tensor. Similar to LSA, a lowrank approximation of the tensor is derived using a tensor decomposition. Each word in the vocabulary is thus represented by a vector in the latent semantic space and each relation is captured by a latent square matrix. The degree of two words having a specific relation can then be measured through simple linear algebraic operations. We demonstrate that by integrating multiple relations from both homogeneous and heterogeneous information sources, MRLSA achieves state- of-the-art performance on existing benchmark datasets for two relations, antonymy and is-a.</p><p>2 0.7463789 <a title="137-lsi-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Prior_Disambiguation_of_Word_Tensors_for_Constructing_Sentence_Vectors.html">154 emnlp-2013-Prior Disambiguation of Word Tensors for Constructing Sentence Vectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Dimitri Kartsaklis ; Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has shown that compositionaldistributional models using element-wise operations on contextual word vectors benefit from the introduction of a prior disambiguation step. The purpose of this paper is to generalise these ideas to tensor-based models, where relational words such as verbs and adjectives are represented by linear maps (higher order tensors) acting on a number of arguments (vectors). We propose disambiguation algorithms for a number of tensor-based models, which we then test on a variety of tasks. The results show that disambiguation can provide better compositional representation even for the case of tensor-based models. Further- more, we confirm previous findings regarding the positive effect of disambiguation on vector mixture models, and we compare the effectiveness of the two approaches.</p><p>3 0.4651804 <a title="137-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Modeling_and_Learning_Semantic_Co-Compositionality_through_Prototype_Projections_and_Neural_Networks.html">134 emnlp-2013-Modeling and Learning Semantic Co-Compositionality through Prototype Projections and Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Masashi Tsubaki ; Kevin Duh ; Masashi Shimbo ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel vector space model for semantic co-compositionality. Inspired by Generative Lexicon Theory (Pustejovsky, 1995), our goal is a compositional model where both predicate and argument are allowed to modify each others’ meaning representations while generating the overall semantics. This readily addresses some major challenges with current vector space models, notably the polysemy issue and the use of one representation per word type. We implement cocompositionality using prototype projections on predicates/arguments and show that this is effective in adapting their word representations. We further cast the model as a neural network and propose an unsupervised algorithm to jointly train word representations with co-compositionality. The model achieves the best result to date (ρ = 0.47) on the semantic similarity task of transitive verbs (Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011).</p><p>4 0.43473399 <a title="137-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Discriminative_Improvements_to_Distributional_Sentence_Similarity.html">64 emnlp-2013-Discriminative Improvements to Distributional Sentence Similarity</a></p>

<p>Author: Niranjan Balasubramanian ; Stephen Soderland ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) demonstrated that event schemas can be automatically induced from text corpora. However, our analysis of their schemas identifies several weaknesses, e.g., some schemas lack a common topic and distinct roles are incorrectly mixed into a single actor. It is due in part to their pair-wise representation that treats subjectverb independently from verb-object. This often leads to subject-verb-object triples that are not meaningful in the real-world. We present a novel approach to inducing open-domain event schemas that overcomes these limitations. Our approach uses cooccurrence statistics of semantically typed relational triples, which we call Rel-grams (relational n-grams). In a human evaluation, our schemas outperform Chambers’s schemas by wide margins on several evaluation criteria. Both Rel-grams and event schemas are freely available to the research community.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.77712768 <a title="137-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Multi-Relational_Latent_Semantic_Analysis.html">137 emnlp-2013-Multi-Relational Latent Semantic Analysis</a></p>

We find that diversity can improve performance on these tasks, especially for sentences that are difficult for MT.</p><p>4 0.61346573 <a title="137-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Discriminative_Improvements_to_Distributional_Sentence_Similarity.html">64 emnlp-2013-Discriminative Improvements to Distributional Sentence Similarity</a></p>

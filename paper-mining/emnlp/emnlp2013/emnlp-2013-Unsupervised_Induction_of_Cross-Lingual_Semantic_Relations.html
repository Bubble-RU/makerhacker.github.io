<p>Author: Wiltrud Kessler ; Jonas Kuhn</p><p>Abstract: This short paper presents a pilot study investigating the training of a standard Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) system on product reviews for the new task of detecting comparisons. An (opinionated) comparison consists of a comparative “predicate” and up to three “arguments”: the entity evaluated positively, the entity evaluated negatively, and the aspect under which the comparison is made. In user-generated product reviews, the “predicate” and “arguments” are expressed in highly heterogeneous ways; but since the elements are textually annotated in existing datasets, SRL is technically applicable. We address the interesting question how well training an outof-the-box SRL model works for English data. We observe that even without any feature engineering or other major adaptions to our task, the system outperforms a reasonable heuristic baseline in all steps (predicate identification, argument identification and argument classification) and in three different datasets.</p><p>3 0.24373773 <a title="193-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Semantic_Parsing_on_Freebase_from_Question-Answer_Pairs.html">166 emnlp-2013-Semantic Parsing on Freebase from Question-Answer Pairs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Andrew Chou ; Roy Frostig ; Percy Liang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we train a semantic parser that scales up to Freebase. Instead of relying on annotated logical forms, which is especially expensive to obtain at large scale, we learn from question-answer pairs. The main challenge in this setting is narrowing down the huge number of possible logical predicates for a given question. We tackle this problem in two ways: First, we build a coarse mapping from phrases to predicates using a knowledge base and a large text corpus. Second, we use a bridging operation to generate additional predicates based on neighboring predicates. On the dataset ofCai and Yates (2013), despite not having annotated logical forms, our system outperforms their state-of-the-art parser. Additionally, we collected a more realistic and challenging dataset of question-answer pairs and improves over a natural baseline.</p><p>4 0.21574907 <a title="193-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Semantically_Enhanced_Approach_to_Determine_Textual_Similarity.html">12 emnlp-2013-A Semantically Enhanced Approach to Determine Textual Similarity</a></p>

<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Eunsol Choi ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We consider the challenge of learning semantic parsers that scale to large, open-domain problems, such as question answering with Freebase. In such settings, the sentences cover a wide variety of topics and include many phrases whose meaning is difficult to represent in a fixed target ontology. For example, even simple phrases such as ‘daughter’ and ‘number of people living in’ cannot be directly represented in Freebase, whose ontology instead encodes facts about gender, parenthood, and population. In this paper, we introduce a new semantic parsing approach that learns to resolve such ontological mismatches. The parser is learned from question-answer pairs, uses a probabilistic CCG to build linguistically motivated logicalform meaning representations, and includes an ontology matching model that adapts the output logical forms for each target ontology. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark semantic parsing datasets, including a nine point accuracy improvement on a recent Freebase QA corpus.</p><p>6 0.13064685 <a title="193-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Distributions_over_Logical_Forms_for_Referring_Expression_Generation.html">119 emnlp-2013-Learning Distributions over Logical Forms for Referring Expression Generation</a></p>

<p>Author: Joshua K. Hartshorne ; Claire Bonial ; Martha Palmer</p><p>Abstract: This research describes efforts to use crowdsourcing to improve the validity of the semantic predicates in VerbNet, a lexicon of about 6300 English verbs. The current semantic predicates can be thought of semantic primitives, into which the concepts denoted by a verb can be decomposed. For example, the verb spray (of the Spray class), involves the predicates MOTION, NOT, and LOCATION, where the event can be decomposed into an AGENT causing a THEME that was originally not in a particular location to now be in that location. Although VerbNet’s predicates are theoretically well-motivated, systematic empirical data is scarce. This paper describes a recently-launched attempt to address this issue with a series of human judgment tasks, posed to subjects in the form of games.</p><p>6 0.48236167 <a title="193-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Distributions_over_Logical_Forms_for_Referring_Expression_Generation.html">119 emnlp-2013-Learning Distributions over Logical Forms for Referring Expression Generation</a></p>

<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Traditional synchronous grammar induction estimates parameters by maximizing likelihood, which only has a loose relation to translation quality. Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>3 0.65375876 <a title="193-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Learning_and_Inference_for_Grammatical_Error_Correction.html">114 emnlp-2013-Joint Learning and Inference for Grammatical Error Correction</a></p>
<p>Author: Alla Rozovskaya ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art systems for grammatical error correction are based on a collection of independently-trained models for specific errors. Such models ignore linguistic interactions at the sentence level and thus do poorly on mistakes that involve grammatical dependencies among several words. In this paper, we identify linguistic structures with interacting grammatical properties and propose to address such dependencies via joint inference and joint learning. We show that it is possible to identify interactions well enough to facilitate a joint approach and, consequently, that joint methods correct incoherent predictions that independentlytrained classifiers tend to produce. Furthermore, because the joint learning model considers interacting phenomena during training, it is able to identify mistakes that require mak- ing multiple changes simultaneously and that standard approaches miss. Overall, our model significantly outperforms the Illinois system that placed first in the CoNLL-2013 shared task on grammatical error correction.</p><p>4 0.65296924 <a title="193-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Personal_Profile_Summarization_with_Social_Networks.html">48 emnlp-2013-Collective Personal Profile Summarization with Social Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>5 0.65115231 <a title="193-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Deep_Models_for_Semantic_Compositionality_Over_a_Sentiment_Treebank.html">158 emnlp-2013-Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Alex Perelygin ; Jean Wu ; Jason Chuang ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Semantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning of longer phrases in a principled way. Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.</p><p>6 0.65092552 <a title="193-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Study_on_Bootstrapping_Bilingual_Vector_Spaces_from_Non-Parallel_Data_%28and_Nothing_Else%29.html">13 emnlp-2013-A Study on Bootstrapping Bilingual Vector Spaces from Non-Parallel Data (and Nothing Else)</a></p>

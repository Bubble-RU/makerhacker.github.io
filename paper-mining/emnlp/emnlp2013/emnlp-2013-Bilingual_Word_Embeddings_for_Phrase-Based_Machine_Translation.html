<p>Author: Xiaoqing Zheng ; Hanyang Chen ; Tianyu Xu</p><p>Abstract: This study explores the feasibility of performing Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and POS tagging by deep learning. We try to avoid task-specific feature engineering, and use deep layers of neural networks to discover relevant features to the tasks. We leverage large-scale unlabeled data to improve internal representation of Chinese characters, and use these improved representations to enhance supervised word segmentation and POS tagging models. Our networks achieved close to state-of-theart performance with minimal computational cost. We also describe a perceptron-style algorithm for training the neural networks, as an alternative to maximum-likelihood method, to speed up the training process and make the learning algorithm easier to be implemented.</p><p>3 0.19764283 <a title="38-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Connecting_Language_and_Knowledge_Bases_with_Embedding_Models_for_Relation_Extraction.html">51 emnlp-2013-Connecting Language and Knowledge Bases with Embedding Models for Relation Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Weston ; Antoine Bordes ; Oksana Yakhnenko ; Nicolas Usunier</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for relation extraction from free text which is trained to jointly use information from the text and from existing knowledge. Our model is based on scoring functions that operate by learning low-dimensional embeddings of words, entities and relationships from a knowledge base. We empirically show on New York Times articles aligned with Freebase relations that our approach is able to efficiently use the extra information provided by a large subset of Freebase data (4M entities, 23k relationships) to improve over methods that rely on text features alone.</p><p>4 0.1891059 <a title="38-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised_Representation_Learning_for_Cross-Lingual_Text_Classification.html">169 emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised Representation Learning for Cross-Lingual Text Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Min Xiao ; Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual adaptation aims to learn a prediction model in a label-scarce target language by exploiting labeled data from a labelrich source language. An effective crosslingual adaptation system can substantially reduce the manual annotation effort required in many natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose a new cross-lingual adaptation approach for document classification based on learning cross-lingual discriminative distributed representations of words. Specifically, we propose to maximize the loglikelihood of the documents from both language domains under a cross-lingual logbilinear document model, while minimizing the prediction log-losses of labeled documents. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks of Amazon product reviews. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the pro- posed cross-lingual adaptation approach.</p><p>5 0.17638499 <a title="38-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Autoencoders_for_ITG-Based_Translation.html">157 emnlp-2013-Recursive Autoencoders for ITG-Based Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Li ; Yang Liu ; Maosong Sun</p><p>Abstract: While inversion transduction grammar (ITG) is well suited for modeling ordering shifts between languages, how to make applying the two reordering rules (i.e., straight and inverted) dependent on actual blocks being merged remains a challenge. Unlike previous work that only uses boundary words, we propose to use recursive autoencoders to make full use of the entire merging blocks alternatively. The recursive autoencoders are capable of generating vector space representations for variable-sized phrases, which enable predicting orders to exploit syntactic and semantic information from a neural language modeling’s perspective. Experiments on the NIST 2008 dataset show that our system significantly improves over the MaxEnt classifier by 1.07 BLEU points.</p><p>6 0.17264773 <a title="38-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Systematic_Exploration_of_Diversity_in_Machine_Translation.html">15 emnlp-2013-A Systematic Exploration of Diversity in Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ivan Vulic ; Marie-Francine Moens</p><p>Abstract: We present a new language pair agnostic approach to inducing bilingual vector spaces from non-parallel data without any other resource in a bootstrapping fashion. The paper systematically introduces and describes all key elements of the bootstrapping procedure: (1) starting point or seed lexicon, (2) the confidence estimation and selection of new dimensions of the space, and (3) convergence. We test the quality of the induced bilingual vector spaces, and analyze the influence of the different components of the bootstrapping approach in the task of bilingual lexicon extraction (BLE) for two language pairs. Results reveal that, contrary to conclusions from prior work, the seeding of the bootstrapping process has a heavy impact on the quality of the learned lexicons. We also show that our approach outperforms the best performing fully corpus-based BLE methods on these test sets.</p><p>3 0.57568938 <a title="38-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Connecting_Language_and_Knowledge_Bases_with_Embedding_Models_for_Relation_Extraction.html">51 emnlp-2013-Connecting Language and Knowledge Bases with Embedding Models for Relation Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Hiroshi Noji ; Daichi Mochihashi ; Yusuke Miyao</p><p>Abstract: One of the language phenomena that n-gram language model fails to capture is the topic information of a given situation. We advance the previous study of the Bayesian topic language model by Wallach (2006) in two directions: one, investigating new priors to alleviate the sparseness problem caused by dividing all ngrams into exclusive topics, and two, developing a novel Gibbs sampler that enables moving multiple n-grams across different documents to another topic. Our blocked sampler can efficiently search for higher probability space even with higher order n-grams. In terms of modeling assumption, we found it is effective to assign a topic to only some parts of a document.</p><p>2 0.8674289 <a title="38-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Dataset_for_Research_on_Short-Text_Conversations.html">4 emnlp-2013-A Dataset for Research on Short-Text Conversations</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Zhengdong Lu ; Hang Li ; Enhong Chen</p><p>Abstract: Natural language conversation is widely regarded as a highly difficult problem, which is usually attacked with either rule-based or learning-based models. In this paper we propose a retrieval-based automatic response model for short-text conversation, to exploit the vast amount of short conversation instances available on social media. For this purpose we introduce a dataset of short-text conversation based on the real-world instances from Sina Weibo (a popular Chinese microblog service), which will be soon released to public. This dataset provides rich collection of instances for the research on finding natural and relevant short responses to a given short text, and useful for both training and testing of conversation models. This dataset consists of both naturally formed conversations, manually labeled data, and a large repository of candidate responses. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that the simple retrieval-based conversation model performs reasonably well when combined with the rich instances in our dataset.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.83407646 <a title="38-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Bilingual_Word_Embeddings_for_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation.html">38 emnlp-2013-Bilingual Word Embeddings for Phrase-Based Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Stella Frank ; Frank Keller ; Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: Frank Keller keller@ inf .ed .ac .uk Sharon Goldwater sgwater@ inf .ed .ac .uk ILCC, School of Informatics University of Edinburgh Edinburgh, EH8 9AB, UK interactions are often (but not necessarily) synergisChildren learn various levels of linguistic structure concurrently, yet most existing models of language acquisition deal with only a single level of structure, implicitly assuming a sequential learning process. Developing models that learn multiple levels simultaneously can provide important insights into how these levels might interact synergistically dur- ing learning. Here, we present a model that jointly induces syntactic categories and morphological segmentations by combining two well-known models for the individual tasks. We test on child-directed utterances in English and Spanish and compare to single-task baselines. In the morphologically poorer language (English), the model improves morphological segmentation, while in the morphologically richer language (Spanish), it leads to better syntactic categorization. These results provide further evidence that joint learning is useful, but also suggest that the benefits may be different for typologically different languages.</p><p>5 0.79331255 <a title="38-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Open-Domain_Fine-Grained_Class_Extraction_from_Web_Search_Queries.html">142 emnlp-2013-Open-Domain Fine-Grained Class Extraction from Web Search Queries</a></p>

<p>Author: Kai-Wei Chang ; Rajhans Samdani ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Coreference resolution is a well known clustering task in Natural Language Processing. In this paper, we describe the Latent Left Linking model (L3M), a novel, principled, and linguistically motivated latent structured prediction approach to coreference resolution. We show that L3M admits efficient inference and can be augmented with knowledge-based constraints; we also present a fast stochastic gradient based learning. Experiments on ACE and Ontonotes data show that L3M and its constrained version, CL3M, are more accurate than several state-of-the-art approaches as well as some structured prediction models proposed in the literature.</p><p>4 0.094814494 <a title="114-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Relational_Inference_for_Wikification.html">160 emnlp-2013-Relational Inference for Wikification</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao Cheng ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Wikification, commonly referred to as Disambiguation to Wikipedia (D2W), is the task of identifying concepts and entities in text and disambiguating them into the most specific corresponding Wikipedia pages. Previous approaches to D2W focused on the use of local and global statistics over the given text, Wikipedia articles and its link structures, to evaluate context compatibility among a list of probable candidates. However, these methods fail (often, embarrassingly), when some level of text understanding is needed to support Wikification. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to Wikification by incorporating, along with statistical methods, richer relational analysis of the text. We provide an extensible, efficient and modular Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of Wikification that incorporates the entity-relation inference problem, and show that the ability to identify relations in text helps both candi- date generation and ranking Wikipedia titles considerably. Our results show significant improvements in both Wikification and the TAC Entity Linking task.</p><p>5 0.082157873 <a title="114-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Error-Driven_Analysis_of_Challenges_in_Coreference_Resolution.html">73 emnlp-2013-Error-Driven Analysis of Challenges in Coreference Resolution</a></p>

<p>Author: Hongbo Chen ; Ben He</p><p>Abstract: Previous approaches for automated essay scoring (AES) learn a rating model by minimizing either the classification, regression, or pairwise classification loss, depending on the learning algorithm used. In this paper, we argue that the current AES systems can be further improved by taking into account the agreement between human and machine raters. To this end, we propose a rankbased approach that utilizes listwise learning to rank algorithms for learning a rating model, where the agreement between the human and machine raters is directly incorporated into the loss function. Various linguistic and statistical features are utilized to facilitate the learning algorithms. Experiments on the publicly available English essay dataset, Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP), show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, and achieves performance comparable to professional human raters, which suggests the effectiveness of our proposed method for automated essay scoring.</p><p>6 0.47827539 <a title="114-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Two-Stage_Method_for_Large-Scale_Acquisition_of_Contradiction_Pattern_Pairs_using_Entailment.html">189 emnlp-2013-Two-Stage Method for Large-Scale Acquisition of Contradiction Pattern Pairs using Entailment</a></p>

<p>Author: He He ; Hal Daume III ; Jason Eisner</p><p>Abstract: Feature computation and exhaustive search have significantly restricted the speed of graph-based dependency parsing. We propose a faster framework of dynamic feature selection, where features are added sequentially as needed, edges are pruned early, and decisions are made online for each sentence. We model this as a sequential decision-making problem and solve it by imitation learning techniques. We test our method on 7 languages. Our dynamic parser can achieve accuracies comparable or even superior to parsers using a full set of features, while computing fewer than 30% of the feature templates.</p><p>3 0.79193467 <a title="114-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Autoencoders_for_ITG-Based_Translation.html">157 emnlp-2013-Recursive Autoencoders for ITG-Based Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Li ; Yang Liu ; Maosong Sun</p><p>Abstract: While inversion transduction grammar (ITG) is well suited for modeling ordering shifts between languages, how to make applying the two reordering rules (i.e., straight and inverted) dependent on actual blocks being merged remains a challenge. Unlike previous work that only uses boundary words, we propose to use recursive autoencoders to make full use of the entire merging blocks alternatively. The recursive autoencoders are capable of generating vector space representations for variable-sized phrases, which enable predicting orders to exploit syntactic and semantic information from a neural language modeling’s perspective. Experiments on the NIST 2008 dataset show that our system significantly improves over the MaxEnt classifier by 1.07 BLEU points.</p><p>4 0.79164052 <a title="114-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Easy_Victories_and_Uphill_Battles_in_Coreference_Resolution.html">67 emnlp-2013-Easy Victories and Uphill Battles in Coreference Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Classical coreference systems encode various syntactic, discourse, and semantic phenomena explicitly, using heterogenous features computed from hand-crafted heuristics. In contrast, we present a state-of-the-art coreference system that captures such phenomena implicitly, with a small number of homogeneous feature templates examining shallow properties of mentions. Surprisingly, our features are actually more effective than the corresponding hand-engineered ones at modeling these key linguistic phenomena, allowing us to win “easy victories” without crafted heuristics. These features are successful on syntax and discourse; however, they do not model semantic compatibility well, nor do we see gains from experiments with shallow semantic features from the literature, suggesting that this approach to semantics is an “uphill battle.” Nonetheless, our final system1 outperforms the Stanford system (Lee et al. (201 1), the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task) by 3.5% absolute on the CoNLL metric and outperforms the IMS system (Bj o¨rkelund and Farkas (2012), the best publicly available English coreference system) by 1.9% absolute.</p><p>5 0.79091841 <a title="114-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Translation_with_Source_Constituency_and_Dependency_Trees.html">187 emnlp-2013-Translation with Source Constituency and Dependency Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Fandong Meng ; Jun Xie ; Linfeng Song ; Yajuan Lu ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel translation model, which simultaneously exploits the constituency and dependency trees on the source side, to combine the advantages of two types of trees. We take head-dependents relations of dependency trees as backbone and incorporate phrasal nodes of constituency trees as the source side of our translation rules, and the target side as strings. Our rules hold the property of long distance reorderings and the compatibility with phrases. Large-scale experimental results show that our model achieves significantly improvements over the constituency-to-string (+2.45 BLEU on average) and dependencyto-string (+0.91 BLEU on average) models, which only employ single type of trees, and significantly outperforms the state-of-theart hierarchical phrase-based model (+1.12 BLEU on average), on three Chinese-English NIST test sets.</p><p>6 0.79080343 <a title="114-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Anchor_Graph%3A_Global_Reordering_Contexts_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">22 emnlp-2013-Anchor Graph: Global Reordering Contexts for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

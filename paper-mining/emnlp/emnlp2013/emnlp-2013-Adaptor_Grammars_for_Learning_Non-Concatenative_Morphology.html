</p><p>5 1 Introduction Unsupervised learning of morphology is the task of acquiring, from unannotated data, the intra-word building blocks of a language and the rules by which they combine to form words. [sent-10, score-0.255]
</p><p>6 This task is of interest both as a gateway for studying language acquisition in humans and as a way of producing morphological analyses that are of practical use in a variety of natural language processing tasks, including machine translation, parsing and information retrieval. [sent-11, score-0.193]
</p><p>7 A particularly interesting version of the morphology learning problem comes from languages that use templatic morphology, such as Arabic, Hebrew and Amharic. [sent-12, score-0.345]
</p><p>8 uk root morphemes into templatic structures in a nonconcatenative way. [sent-16, score-0.389]
</p><p>9 The practical appeal of unsupervised learning of templatic morphology is that it can overcome these shortcomings. [sent-21, score-0.333]
</p><p>10 Unsupervised learning of concatenative morphology has received extensive attention, partly driven by the MorphoChallenge (Kurimo et al. [sent-22, score-0.299]
</p><p>11 , 2010) in recent years, but that is not the case for root-templatic morphology (Hammarstr o¨m and Borin, 2011). [sent-23, score-0.19]
</p><p>12 In this paper we present a model-based method that learns concatenative and root-templatic morphology in a unified framework. [sent-24, score-0.299]
</p><p>13 We build on two disparate strands of work from the literature: Firstly, we apply simple Range Concatenating Grammars (SRCGs) (Boullier, 2000) to parse contiguous and discontiguous morphemes from an input string. [sent-25, score-0.304]
</p><p>14 These grammars are mildly-context sensitive (Joshi, 1985), a superset of context-free grammars that  retains polynomial parsing time-complexity. [sent-26, score-0.389]
</p><p>15 Secondly, we generalise the nonparametric Bayesian learning framework of adaptor grammars (Johnson et al. [sent-27, score-0.517]
</p><p>16 , 1991), all of which are weaker than (non-simple) range concatenating grammars (Boullier, 2000). [sent-31, score-0.227]
</p><p>17 In addition to unannotated data, our method requires as input a minimal set of high-level grammar rules that encode basic intuitions of the morphology. [sent-38, score-0.199]
</p><p>18 2  A powerful grammar for morphology  Concatenative morphology lends itself well to an analysis in terms of finite-state transducers (FSTs) (Koskenniemi, 1984). [sent-42, score-0.514]
</p><p>19 With some additional effort, FSTs can also encode non-concatenative morphology (Kiraz, 2000; Beesley and Karttunen, 2003; Cohen-Sygal and Wintner, 2006; Gasser, 2009). [sent-43, score-0.19]
</p><p>20 We are not aware of successful attempts at inducing FST-based morphological analysers in an unsupervised way, and believe the challenge lies in the fact that FSTs do not offer a convenient way of expressing prior linguistic intuitions to guide the learning process. [sent-45, score-0.24]
</p><p>21 These shortcomings are overcome for concate-  native morphology by context-free adaptor grammars, which allowed diverse segmentation models to be formulated and investigated within a single framework (Johnson et al. [sent-47, score-0.617]
</p><p>22 In this pursuit, an abstraction that permits discontiguous constituents is a highly useful modelling tool, but requires looking beyond context-free grammars. [sent-51, score-0.195]
</p><p>23 The bold-faced “functions” combine the potentially discontiguous yields of the argument symbols into single contiguous strings, e. [sent-61, score-0.22]
</p><p>24 Taken by themselves, the first two rules are simply a CFG that describes word formation as the concatenation of stems and affixes, a formulation that matches the underlying grammar of Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2007), a well-studied unsupervised model. [sent-64, score-0.363]
</p><p>25 The key aim of our extension is that we want the grammar to capture a discontiguous string like k·t·b as a single oco canpsttuitrueen at d iins a parse tursee s. [sent-65, score-0.363]
</p><p>26 s 3  Simple range concatenating grammars  In this section we define SRCGs formally and illustrate how they can be used to model nonconcatenative morphology. [sent-70, score-0.288]
</p><p>27 SRCGs define languages that are recognisable in polynomial time, yet can capture discontiguous elements of a string under a single category (Boullier, 2000). [sent-71, score-0.241]

</p><p>32 3 This is a daunting proposition for parsing, but we are careful 3The trade-off between arity and rank with respect to parsing complexity has been characterised (Gildea, 2010), and the appropriate refactoring may bring down the complexity for our grammars too. [sent-144, score-0.275]
</p><p>33 to set up our application of SRCGs in such a way that this is not too big an obstacle: Firstly, our grammars are defined over the characters that make up a word, and not over words that make up a sentence. [sent-145, score-0.219]

</p><p>36 The probability P(w, t) of the rQesulting tree t and  terminal string w is the product Qr θr over the sequence of rewrite rules used. [sent-161, score-0.242]
</p><p>37 Adaptor grammars weaken this independence assumption by allowing whole subtrees to be reused during expansion. [sent-166, score-0.212]
</p><p>38 Informally, they act as a cache of tree fragments whose tendency to be reused during expansion is governed by the choice of adaptor function. [sent-167, score-0.469]
</p><p>39 Following earlier applications of adaptor grammars (Johnson et al. [sent-168, score-0.482]
</p><p>40 , 2011), we employ the Pitman-Yor process (Pitman, 1995; Pit-  man and Yor, 1997) as adaptor function. [sent-170, score-0.304]
</p><p>41 The first case denotes the situation where a previously cached tree is reused for this n + 1-th expansion of A; to be clear, this expands A with a fully terminating tree fragment, meaning that none of the nodes descending from A in the tree being generated are subject to further expansion. [sent-185, score-0.331]
</p><p>42 The invariance of SRCGs trees under isomorphism would make the probabilistic model deficient,  but we side-step this issue by requiring that grammar rules are specified in a canonical way that ensures a one-to-one correspondence between the order of nodes in a tree and of terminals in the yield. [sent-190, score-0.29]

</p><p>59 As external baseline model we used Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2007), which performs decently  in morphological segmentation of a variety of languages, but only handles concatenation. [sent-271, score-0.283]
</p><p>60 Collected samples, each of which is a set of parse trees of the input word types, are used in two ways: First, by averaging over the samples we can estimate the joint probability of a word type w and a parse tree t under the adaptor grammar, conditional on the data and the model’s hyperparameters.

</p><p>62 The main result is that all our models capable of 351 forming complex stems obtain a marked improvement in F-scores over the baseline concatenative adaptor grammar, and the margin of improvement grows along with the expressivity of the complexstem models tested. [sent-283, score-0.543]
</p><p>63 This applies across prefix, stem and suffix categories and across our datasets, with the exception of which we elaborate on in §6. [sent-284, score-0.361]

</p><p>72 Two aspects of interest are the segmentation into sequential morphemes and the identification of the root. [sent-352, score-0.204]
</p><p>73 Our intercalating adaptor grammars consistently obtain large gains in segmentation accuracy over the baseline concatenative model, across all our datasets (Table 3). [sent-353, score-0.714]
</p><p>74 Of the two MSA datasets, the vocalised version presents a more difficult segmentation task as its words are on average longer and feature 31k unique contiguous morphemes, compared to the 24k in BW for the same number of words. [sent-355, score-0.227]
</p><p>75 The best triliteral root identification accuracy (on a per-word basis) was found for HEB (74%) and BW (67%). [sent-357, score-0.215]

<p>Author: Jan A. Botha ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: This paper contributes an approach for expressing non-concatenative morphological phenomena, such as stem derivation in Semitic languages, in terms of a mildly context-sensitive grammar formalism. This offers a convenient level of modelling abstraction while remaining computationally tractable.

<p>Author: Michel Galley ; Chris Quirk ; Colin Cherry ; Kristina Toutanova</p><p>Abstract: Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) remains one of the preferred methods for tuning linear parameters in machine translation systems, yet it faces significant issues. First, MERT is an unregularized learner and is therefore prone to overfitting. Second, it is commonly used on a noisy, non-convex loss function that becomes more difficult to optimize as the number of parameters increases. To address these issues, we study the addition of a regularization term to the MERT objective function. Since standard regularizers such as ‘2 are inapplicable to MERT due to the scale invariance of its objective function, we turn to two regularizers—‘0 and a modification of‘2— and present methods for efficiently integrating them during search. To improve search in large parameter spaces, we also present a new direction finding algorithm that uses the gradient of expected BLEU to orient MERT’s exact line searches. Experiments with up to 3600 features show that these extensions of MERT yield results comparable to PRO, a learner often used with large feature sets.</p><p>2 0.89908129 <a title="19-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Language_Models_for_Visual_Recognition.html">78 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Language Models for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Dieu-Thu Le ; Jasper Uijlings ; Raffaella Bernardi</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning language models from large text corpora has been widely studied within the computational linguistic community. However, little is known about the performance of these language models when applied to the computer vision domain. In this work, we compare representative models: a window-based model, a topic model, a distributional memory and a commonsense knowledge database, ConceptNet, in two visual recognition scenarios: human action recognition and object prediction. We examine whether the knowledge extracted from texts through these models are compatible to the knowledge represented in images. We determine the usefulness of different language models in aiding the two visual recognition tasks. The study shows that the language models built from general text corpora can be used instead of expensive annotated images and even outperform the image model when testing on a big general dataset.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.82681608 <a title="19-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Adaptor_Grammars_for_Learning_Non-Concatenative_Morphology.html">19 emnlp-2013-Adaptor Grammars for Learning Non-Concatenative Morphology</a></p>

<p>Author: Desmond Elliott ; Frank Keller</p><p>Abstract: Describing the main event of an image involves identifying the objects depicted and predicting the relationships between them. Previous approaches have represented images as unstructured bags of regions, which makes it difficult to accurately predict meaningful relationships between regions. In this paper, we introduce visual dependency representations to capture the relationships between the objects in an image, and hypothesize that this representation can improve image description. We test this hypothesis using a new data set of region-annotated images, associated with visual dependency representations and gold-standard descriptions. We describe two template-based description generation models that operate over visual dependency representations. In an image descrip- tion task, we find that these models outperform approaches that rely on object proximity or corpus information to generate descriptions on both automatic measures and on human judgements.</p><p>5 0.52545053 <a title="19-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Of_Words%2C_Eyes_and_Brains%3A_Correlating_Image-Based_Distributional_Semantic_Models_with_Neural_Representations_of_Concepts.html">140 emnlp-2013-Of Words, Eyes and Brains: Correlating Image-Based Distributional Semantic Models with Neural Representations of Concepts</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew J. Anderson ; Elia Bruni ; Ulisse Bordignon ; Massimo Poesio ; Marco Baroni</p><p>Abstract: Traditional distributional semantic models extract word meaning representations from cooccurrence patterns of words in text corpora. Recently, the distributional approach has been extended to models that record the cooccurrence of words with visual features in image collections. These image-based models should be complementary to text-based ones, providing a more cognitively plausible view of meaning grounded in visual perception. In this study, we test whether image-based models capture the semantic patterns that emerge from fMRI recordings of the neural signal. Our results indicate that, indeed, there is a significant correlation between image-based and brain-based semantic similarities, and that image-based models complement text-based ones, so that the best correlations are achieved when the two modalities are combined. Despite some unsatisfactory, but explained out- comes (in particular, failure to detect differential association of models with brain areas), the results show, on the one hand, that imagebased distributional semantic models can be a precious new tool to explore semantic representation in the brain, and, on the other, that neural data can be used as the ultimate test set to validate artificial semantic models in terms of their cognitive plausibility.</p><p>6 0.49049115 <a title="19-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Improving_Web_Search_Ranking_by_Incorporating_Structured_Annotation_of_Queries.html">105 emnlp-2013-Improving Web Search Ranking by Incorporating Structured Annotation of Queries</a></p>

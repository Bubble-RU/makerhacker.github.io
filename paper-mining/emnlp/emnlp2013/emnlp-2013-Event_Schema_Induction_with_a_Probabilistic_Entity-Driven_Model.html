<p>Author: Niranjan Balasubramanian ; Stephen Soderland ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) demonstrated that event schemas can be automatically induced from text corpora. However, our analysis of their schemas identifies several weaknesses, e.g., some schemas lack a common topic and distinct roles are incorrectly mixed into a single actor. It is due in part to their pair-wise representation that treats subjectverb independently from verb-object. This often leads to subject-verb-object triples that are not meaningful in the real-world. We present a novel approach to inducing open-domain event schemas that overcomes these limitations. Our approach uses cooccurrence statistics of semantically typed relational triples, which we call Rel-grams (relational n-grams). In a human evaluation, our schemas outperform Chambers’s schemas by wide margins on several evaluation criteria. Both Rel-grams and event schemas are freely available to the research community.</p><p>3 0.13225034 <a title="75-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Detection_of_Product_Comparisons_-_How_Far_Does_an_Out-of-the-Box_Semantic_Role_Labeling_System_Take_You%3F.html">62 emnlp-2013-Detection of Product Comparisons - How Far Does an Out-of-the-Box Semantic Role Labeling System Take You?</a></p>
<p>Author: Wiltrud Kessler ; Jonas Kuhn</p><p>Abstract: This short paper presents a pilot study investigating the training of a standard Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) system on product reviews for the new task of detecting comparisons. An (opinionated) comparison consists of a comparative “predicate” and up to three “arguments”: the entity evaluated positively, the entity evaluated negatively, and the aspect under which the comparison is made. In user-generated product reviews, the “predicate” and “arguments” are expressed in highly heterogeneous ways; but since the elements are textually annotated in existing datasets, SRL is technically applicable. We address the interesting question how well training an outof-the-box SRL model works for English data. We observe that even without any feature engineering or other major adaptions to our task, the system outperforms a reasonable heuristic baseline in all steps (predicate identification, argument identification and argument classification) and in three different datasets.</p><p>4 0.098571025 <a title="75-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Error-Driven_Analysis_of_Challenges_in_Coreference_Resolution.html">73 emnlp-2013-Error-Driven Analysis of Challenges in Coreference Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Coreference resolution metrics quantify errors but do not analyze them. Here, we consider an automated method of categorizing errors in the output of a coreference system into intuitive underlying error types. Using this tool, we first compare the error distributions across a large set of systems, then analyze common errors across the top ten systems, empirically characterizing the major unsolved challenges of the coreference resolution task.</p><p>5 0.08374694 <a title="75-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Easy_Victories_and_Uphill_Battles_in_Coreference_Resolution.html">67 emnlp-2013-Easy Victories and Uphill Battles in Coreference Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Classical coreference systems encode various syntactic, discourse, and semantic phenomena explicitly, using heterogenous features computed from hand-crafted heuristics. In contrast, we present a state-of-the-art coreference system that captures such phenomena implicitly, with a small number of homogeneous feature templates examining shallow properties of mentions. Surprisingly, our features are actually more effective than the corresponding hand-engineered ones at modeling these key linguistic phenomena, allowing us to win “easy victories” without crafted heuristics. These features are successful on syntax and discourse; however, they do not model semantic compatibility well, nor do we see gains from experiments with shallow semantic features from the literature, suggesting that this approach to semantics is an “uphill battle.” Nonetheless, our final system1 outperforms the Stanford system (Lee et al. (201 1), the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task) by 3.5% absolute on the CoNLL metric and outperforms the IMS system (Bj o¨rkelund and Farkas (2012), the best publicly available English coreference system) by 1.9% absolute.</p><p>6 0.082972713 <a title="75-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Improving_Web_Search_Ranking_by_Incorporating_Structured_Annotation_of_Queries.html">105 emnlp-2013-Improving Web Search Ranking by Incorporating Structured Annotation of Queries</a></p>

<p>Author: Oier Lopez de Lacalle ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an unsupervised approach to relational information extraction. Our model partitions tuples representing an observed syntactic relationship between two named entities (e.g., “X was born in Y” and “X is from Y”) into clusters corresponding to underlying semantic relation types (e.g., BornIn, Located). Our approach incorporates general domain knowledge which we encode as First Order Logic rules and automatically combine with a topic model developed specifically for the relation extraction task. Evaluation results on the ACE 2007 English Relation Detection and Categorization (RDC) task show that our model outperforms competitive unsupervised approaches by a wide margin and is able to produce clusters shaped by both the data and the rules.</p><p>4 0.29021651 <a title="75-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Detection_of_Product_Comparisons_-_How_Far_Does_an_Out-of-the-Box_Semantic_Role_Labeling_System_Take_You%3F.html">62 emnlp-2013-Detection of Product Comparisons - How Far Does an Out-of-the-Box Semantic Role Labeling System Take You?</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhichao Hu ; Elahe Rahimtoroghi ; Larissa Munishkina ; Reid Swanson ; Marilyn A. Walker</p><p>Abstract: Human engagement in narrative is partially driven by reasoning about discourse relations between narrative events, and the expectations about what is likely to happen next that results from such reasoning. Researchers in NLP have tackled modeling such expectations from a range of perspectives, including treating it as the inference of the CONTINGENT discourse relation, or as a type of common-sense causal reasoning. Our approach is to model likelihood between events by drawing on several of these lines of previous work. We implement and evaluate different unsupervised methods for learning event pairs that are likely to be CONTINGENT on one another. We refine event pairs that we learn from a corpus of film scene descriptions utilizing web search counts, and evaluate our results by collecting human judgments ofcontingency. Our results indicate that the use of web search counts increases the av- , erage accuracy of our best method to 85.64% over a baseline of 50%, as compared to an average accuracy of 75. 15% without web search.</p><p>6 0.25329158 <a title="75-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatic_Knowledge_Acquisition_for_Case_Alternation_between_the_Passive_and_Active_Voices_in_Japanese.html">33 emnlp-2013-Automatic Knowledge Acquisition for Case Alternation between the Passive and Active Voices in Japanese</a></p>

<p>Author: Joseph Le Roux ; Antoine Rozenknop ; Jennifer Foster</p><p>Abstract: It has recently been shown that different NLP models can be effectively combined using dual decomposition. In this paper we demonstrate that PCFG-LA parsing models are suitable for combination in this way. We experiment with the different models which result from alternative methods of extracting a grammar from a treebank (retaining or discarding function labels, left binarization versus right binarization) and achieve a labeled Parseval F-score of 92.4 on Wall Street Journal Section 23 this represents an absolute improvement of 0.7 and an error reduction rate of 7% over a strong PCFG-LA product-model baseline. Although we experiment only with binarization and function labels in this study, there is much scope for applying this approach to – other grammar extraction strategies.</p><p>3 0.49184 <a title="75-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Hierarchical_Entity-Based_Approach_to_Structuralize_User_Generated_Content_in_Social_Media%3A_A_Case_of_Yahoo%21_Answers.html">7 emnlp-2013-A Hierarchical Entity-Based Approach to Structuralize User Generated Content in Social Media: A Case of Yahoo! Answers</a></p>
<p>Author: Baichuan Li ; Jing Liu ; Chin-Yew Lin ; Irwin King ; Michael R. Lyu</p><p>Abstract: Social media like forums and microblogs have accumulated a huge amount of user generated content (UGC) containing human knowledge. Currently, most of UGC is listed as a whole or in pre-defined categories. This “list-based” approach is simple, but hinders users from browsing and learning knowledge of certain topics effectively. To address this problem, we propose a hierarchical entity-based approach for structuralizing UGC in social media. By using a large-scale entity repository, we design a three-step framework to organize UGC in a novel hierarchical structure called “cluster entity tree (CET)”. With Yahoo! Answers as a test case, we conduct experiments and the results show the effectiveness of our framework in constructing CET. We further evaluate the performance of CET on UGC organization in both user and system aspects. From a user aspect, our user study demonstrates that, with CET-based structure, users perform significantly better in knowledge learning than using traditional list-based approach. From a system aspect, CET substantially boosts the performance of two information retrieval models (i.e., vector space model and query likelihood language model).</p><p>4 0.49085635 <a title="75-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Semantic_Parsing_on_Freebase_from_Question-Answer_Pairs.html">166 emnlp-2013-Semantic Parsing on Freebase from Question-Answer Pairs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Andrew Chou ; Roy Frostig ; Percy Liang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we train a semantic parser that scales up to Freebase. Instead of relying on annotated logical forms, which is especially expensive to obtain at large scale, we learn from question-answer pairs. The main challenge in this setting is narrowing down the huge number of possible logical predicates for a given question. We tackle this problem in two ways: First, we build a coarse mapping from phrases to predicates using a knowledge base and a large text corpus. Second, we use a bridging operation to generate additional predicates based on neighboring predicates. On the dataset ofCai and Yates (2013), despite not having annotated logical forms, our system outperforms their state-of-the-art parser. Additionally, we collected a more realistic and challenging dataset of question-answer pairs and improves over a natural baseline.</p><p>5 0.48863739 <a title="75-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Bootstrapping_of_Corpus_Annotations_and_Entity_Types.html">110 emnlp-2013-Joint Bootstrapping of Corpus Annotations and Entity Types</a></p>
<p>Author: Hrushikesh Mohapatra ; Siddhanth Jain ; Soumen Chakrabarti</p><p>Abstract: Web search can be enhanced in powerful ways if token spans in Web text are annotated with disambiguated entities from large catalogs like Freebase. Entity annotators need to be trained on sample mention snippets. Wikipedia entities and annotated pages offer high-quality labeled data for training and evaluation. Unfortunately, Wikipedia features only one-ninth the number of entities as Freebase, and these are a highly biased sample of well-connected, frequently mentioned “head” entities. To bring hope to “tail” entities, we broaden our goal to a second task: assigning types to entities in Freebase but not Wikipedia. The two tasks are synergistic: knowing the types of unfamiliar entities helps disambiguate mentions, and words in mention contexts help assign types to entities. We present TMI, a bipartite graphical model for joint type-mention inference. TMI attempts no schema integration or entity resolution, but exploits the above-mentioned synergy. In experiments involving 780,000 people in Wikipedia, 2.3 million people in Freebase, 700 million Web pages, and over 20 professional editors, TMI shows considerable annotation accuracy improvement (e.g., 70%) compared to baselines (e.g., 46%), especially for “tail” and emerging entities. We also compare with Google’s recent annotations of the same corpus with Freebase entities, and report considerable improvements within the people domain.</p><p>6 0.48761433 <a title="75-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Scaling_Semantic_Parsers_with_On-the-Fly_Ontology_Matching.html">164 emnlp-2013-Scaling Semantic Parsers with On-the-Fly Ontology Matching</a></p>

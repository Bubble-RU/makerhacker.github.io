</p><p>5 ,  1 Introduction Predicting the success of novels is a curious question among publishers, professional book reviewers, aspiring and even expert writers alike. [sent-6, score-0.519]
</p><p>6 As a result, recognizing successful literary work is a hard task even for experts working in the publication industries. [sent-8, score-0.623]
</p><p>7 1 Perhaps due to its obvious complexity of the problem, there has been little previous work that attempts to build statistical models that predict the success of literary works based on their intrinsic content and quality. [sent-12, score-0.412]
</p><p>8 Some previous studies do touch on the notion of stylistic aspects in successful literature, e. [sent-13, score-0.46]
</p><p>9 , extensive studies in Literature discuss literary styles  of significant authors (e. [sent-15, score-0.322]

</p><p>11 To our knowledge, no prior work has undertaken a systematic quantitative investigation on the overarching characterization of the writing style in successful literature. [sent-21, score-0.691]
</p><p>12 (2003)), it is not even readily clear whether there might be common stylistic elements that help discriminating highly successful ones from less successful counterpart. [sent-27, score-1.02]
</p><p>13 In this work, we present the first study that investigates this unstudied and unexpected connection between stylistic elements and the literary success. [sent-28, score-0.401]

[sent-36, score-0.255]
</p><p>15 Second, we aim to discriminate highly successful novels from less successful, but nonetheless published books written by professional writers, which are undoubtedly of higher quality than average writings. [sent-43, score-1.115]
</p><p>16 It is important to note that the task we tackle here is much harder than discriminating highly successful works from those that have not even passed the scrutinizing eyes of publishers. [sent-44, score-0.563]
</p><p>17 In order to quantify the success of literary works,  and to obtain corresponding gold standard labels, one needs to first define “success ”. [sent-45, score-0.412]
</p><p>18 For practical convenience, we largely rely on the download counts available at Project Gutenberg as a surrogate to quantify the success of novels. [sent-46, score-0.338]
</p><p>19 For a small number of novels however, we also consider award recipients (e. [sent-47, score-0.313]
</p><p>20 We also extend our empirical study to movie scripts, where we quantify the success of movies based on the average review scores at imdb . [sent-50, score-0.352]
</p><p>21 We leave analysis based on other measures of literary success as future research. [sent-52, score-0.412]
</p><p>22 In the case of the corpus obtained from Project Gutenberg, where most of our experiments are conducted, we expect that the download counts are more indicative of success based on the literary  quality (which then may have resulted in popularity) rather than popularity without quality. [sent-55, score-0.647]

[sent-59, score-0.26]
</p><p>24 Our empirical results demonstrate that (1) statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effective in discriminating successful literature, achieving accuracy up to 84%, (2) some elements of successful styles are genre-dependent while others are more universal. [sent-71, score-1.069]
</p><p>25 2  Dataset Construction  For our experiments, we procure novels from project Gutenberg2. [sent-73, score-0.333]
</p><p>26 Project Gutenberg houses over 40, 000 books available for free download in electronic format and provides a catalog containing brief descriptions (title, author, genre, language, download count,  etc. [sent-74, score-0.603]
</p><p>27 We experiment with genres in Table 1, which have sufficient number of books allowing us to construct reasonably sized datasets. [sent-76, score-0.453]
</p><p>28 org/  Figure 1: Differences  in POS tag distribution between more successful and less successful books across different  genres. [sent-79, score-1.274]
</p><p>29 Negative (positive) value indicates higher percentage in less (more) successful class. [sent-80, score-0.463]
</p><p>30 For each genre, we determine a lower bound (τ+) and an upper bound (τ−) of download counts as shown in Table 1 to categorize the available books as more successful and less successful respectively. [sent-82, score-1.332]
</p><p>31 These thresholds are set to obtain at least 50 books for each class, and for each genre. [sent-83, score-0.391]
</p><p>32 To balance the data, for each genre, we construct a dataset of 100 novels (50 per class). [sent-84, score-0.263]
</p><p>33 We make sure that no single author has more than  2 books in the resulting dataset, and in the majority of the cases, only one book has been taken from each author. [sent-85, score-0.361]
</p><p>34 3 Furthermore, we make sure that the books from the same author do not show up in both training and test data. [sent-86, score-0.361]
</p><p>35 These constraints make sure that we learn general linguistic patterns of successful novels, rather than a particular writing style of a few successful authors. [sent-87, score-1.084]
</p><p>36 The first three correspond to the features that have been frequently utilized in previous studies in related tasks, 3The complete list of novels used for each genre in our dataset is available at http : / /www . [sent-89, score-0.384]
</p><p>37 Distribution of Word Categories: Many previous studies have shown that the distribution of part-of-speech (POS) tags alone can reveal surprising insights on genre and authorship (e. [sent-103, score-0.478]
</p><p>38 , Koppel and Schler (2003)), hence we examine their distributions with respect to the success of literary works. [sent-105, score-0.412]
</p><p>39 We experiment with four different encodings of production rules: •  •  •  •  Γ: lexicalized production rules (all production rules, including rthodosuec twiointh r terminals) ΓG: lexicalized production rules prepended wΓith the grandparent node. [sent-112, score-0.33]
</p><p>40 We hypothesize that the distribution of constituents can serve this purpose, and that it will reveal interesting and more interpretable insights into writing styles in highly successful literature. [sent-117, score-0.902]
</p><p>41 In particular, we are interested in examining the distribution of phrasal and/or clausal tags as follows: (i) Phrasal tag percent (PHR) - percentage distribution of phrasal tags. [sent-119, score-0.665]
</p><p>42 4 (ii) Clausal tag percent (CLS) - percentage distribution of clausal tags. [sent-120, score-0.279]
</p><p>43 Distribution of Sentiment and Connotation: Finally, we examine whether the distribution of sentiment and connotation words, and their polarity, has any correlation with respect to the success of literary  works. [sent-122, score-0.672]
</p><p>44 5 4The percentage ofany phrasal tag is the count ofoccurrence of that tag over the sum of counts of all phrasal tags. [sent-128, score-0.436]
</p><p>45 6In our pilot study, we also experimented with the binary classification task of discriminating highly successful ones from those that are not even published (unpublished online novels),  and it was a much easier task as expected. [sent-137, score-0.531]
</p><p>46 Interestingly, less successful books rely on verbs that are explicitly descriptive of actions and emotions (e. [sent-148, score-0.783]
</p><p>47 ), while more successful books favor verbs that describe thought-processing (e. [sent-151, score-0.754]
</p><p>48 Also, more successful books use discourse connectives and prepositions more frequently, while less successful books rely more on topical words that could be almost clich ´e, e. [sent-156, score-1.566]
</p><p>49 2 Distribution of Sentiment & Connotation We also determine the distribution of sentiment and connotation words separately for each class (Table 5) to check if there exists a connection with respect to successful writing styles. [sent-164, score-0.905]
</p><p>50 7 We first compare distribution of sentiment and connotation for the entire words. [sent-165, score-0.26]
</p><p>51 In particular, discriminative unigrams that characterize less successful novels involve significantly more sentiment-laden words. [sent-173, score-0.714]
</p><p>52 It can be seen that prepositions, nouns, pronouns, determiners and adjectives are predictive of highly successful books whereas less successful books are characterized by higher percentage of verbs, adverbs, and foreign words. [sent-176, score-1.617]
</p><p>53 successful books tend to bear closer resemblance to informative articles. [sent-378, score-0.754]
</p><p>54 Therefore, similarly as word categories (POS), we consider the categories of nonterminal nodes of the parse trees, in particular, phrasal and clausal tags, as they represent the gist of constituent structure that goes beyond shallow syntactic information represented by POS. [sent-383, score-0.277]
</p><p>55 Table 8 shows how the distribution of phrasal and clausal tags differ for successful books when computed over all genres. [sent-384, score-1.143]
</p><p>56 Positive (negative) DIFF values indicate that the corresponding tags are favored in more successful (less successful) books when  counted across all genres. [sent-385, score-0.811]
</p><p>57 In terms of phrasal tags, we find that more successful books are composed of higher percentage of PP, NP and wh-noun phrases (WHNP), whereas less successful books are composed of higher percentage of VP, adverb phrases (ADVP), interjections (INTJ) and fragments (FRAG). [sent-387, score-1.756]
</p><p>58 In regard to clausal tags, more successful books involve more clausal tags that are necessary for complex sentence structure and inverted sentence structure (SBAR, SBARQ and SQ) whereas less successful books rely more on simple sentence structure (S). [sent-389, score-1.874]
</p><p>59 Figure 2 shows the visualization of the distribution of these phrasal and clausal tags. [sent-390, score-0.332]
</p><p>60 It is also worth to mention that phrasal and clausal  Figure 2: Difference between phrasal and clausal tag percentage distributions of more successful and less successful books across different genres. [sent-391, score-1.814]
</p><p>61 Specifically, we plot D−–D+, where D+ is the phrasal tag distribution (in %) of more successful books and D−is the phrasal tag distribution (in %) of less successful books. [sent-392, score-1.646]
</p><p>62 In fact, constituent tags deliver the best performance in case of historical fiction genre (Table 2). [sent-401, score-0.353]
</p><p>63 In their work, among the most discriminating features characterizing text with better readability is increased use of verb phrases (VP). [sent-403, score-0.301]
</p><p>64 Interestingly, contrary to the conventional wisdom that readability is of desirable quality of good writings our findings in Table 2 suggest that the increased use of VP correlates strongly with the writing style of the opposite spectrum of highly successful novels. [sent-404, score-1.098]
</p><p>65 As a secondary way of probing the connection be–  –  1759 tween readability and the writing style of successful literature, we also compute two different readability measures that have been used widely in prior literature (e. [sent-405, score-1.218]
</p><p>66 Again, we find that less successful novels have higher readability compared to more successful ones. [sent-411, score-1.28]
</p><p>67 In sum, our analysis reveals an intriguing and unexpected observation on the connection between readability and the literary success that they correlate into the opposite directions. [sent-415, score-0.686]
</p><p>68 We conjecture that the conceptual complexity of highly successful literary work might require syntactic complexity that goes against readability. [sent-463, score-0.662]
</p><p>69 6 Literature beyond Project Gutenberg One might wonder how the prediction algorithms trained on the dataset based on Project Gutenberg might perform on books not included at Gutenberg. [sent-464, score-0.401]
</p><p>70 Due to the limited availability of electronically available books that are free of charge however, we could not procure more than a handful of books. [sent-466, score-0.393]
</p><p>71 1 Highly Successful Books First, we apply the classifiers trained on the Project Gutenberg dataset (all genres merged) on a few extremely successful novels (Pulitzer prize, National Award recipients, etc). [sent-468, score-0.748]
</p><p>72 Table 9 shows the results of  8We report our prediction results on all books beyond Project Gutenberg of which we managed to get electronic copies, i. [sent-469, score-0.401]
</p><p>73 Although KL-divergence based prediction was not part of the classifiers that we explored in the previous sections, we include it here mainly to provide better insights as to which well-known books share closer structural similarity to either more or less successful writing style. [sent-474, score-1.118]
</p><p>74 As a probability model, we use the distributions of phrasal tags, as those can give us insights on deep syntactic structure while suppressing potential noises due to topical variances. [sent-475, score-0.252]
</p><p>75 Table 9 shows symmetrised KL-divergence between each of the previously unseen novels and the collection of books from Gutenberg corresponding to more successful (less successful) labels. [sent-476, score-1.017]
</p><p>76 Of course, considering only the distribution of phrasal tags is significantly less informed than considering numerous other features that have shown substantially better performance, e. [sent-479, score-0.278]
</p><p>77 It turns out unigram features are powerful enough to make correct predictions for all ten books in Table 9. [sent-483, score-0.391]
</p><p>78 , SVM with unigram features, are still able to recognize Hemingway’s writings as those of  highly successful ones. [sent-488, score-0.531]
</p><p>79 2 Less Successful Books In order to obtain less successful books, we consider the Amazon seller’s rank included in the product details of a book. [sent-490, score-0.422]
</p><p>80 The less successful books considered in Table 9 had an Amazon seller’s rank beyond 200k (higher rank indicating less commercial success) except Dan Brown’s The lost symbol, which we included mainly because of negative critiques it had attracted from media despite its commercial success. [sent-491, score-0.812]
</p><p>81 9 This result also supports our earlier assumption on the nature of novels available at Project Gutenberg that they would be more representative of literary success than general popularity (with or without literary quality). [sent-493, score-0.954]
</p><p>82 —  7 Predicting Success of Movie Scripts We have seen successful results in the novel domain, but can stylometry-based prediction work on very different domains, such as screenplays? [sent-494, score-0.433]
</p><p>83 Unlike novels, movie scripts are mostly in dialogues, which 9Most notable pattern based on phrasal tag analysis is a significantly increased use of fragments (FRAG), which associates  strongly with less successful books in our dataset. [sent-495, score-1.112]
</p><p>84 Also, what to keep in mind is that much of the success of movies de-  pends on factors beyond the quality of writing of the scripts, such as the quality of acting, the popularity of actors, budgets, artistic taste of directors and producers, editing and so forth. [sent-559, score-0.613]
</p><p>85 There are 11 genres (“ADVENTURE”, “FANTASY”, “ROMANCE”, “THRILLER”, “ACTION”, “COMEDY”, “CRIME”, “DRAMA”, “HORROR”, “MYSTERY”, “SCIFI”) with 15 movies or more per class, we take 15 movies per class and perform classification tasks with the same experiment setting as Table 2. [sent-568, score-0.312]
</p><p>86 Table 10, we show some of the example genres with relatively successful outcome, reaching as high as 89. [sent-569, score-0.485]
</p><p>87 —  8  Related Work  Predicting success of novels and movies: To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first that provides quantitative insights into the unstudied connection between the writing style and the success of literary works. [sent-574, score-1.374]
</p><p>88 In contrast, our work examines a considerably larger collection of books (800 in total) over eight different sub-genres, providing insights into lexical, syntactic, and discourse patterns that characterize the writing styles commonly shared among the successful  literature. [sent-578, score-1.141]
</p><p>89 Combining the insights from Louis (2012) with our results, we find that the characteristics of text quality explored in Louis (2012), readability of text in particular, do not correspond to the prominent writing style of highly successful literature. [sent-581, score-1.111]
</p><p>90 There have been a number of other work that focused on predicting and measuring readability (e. [sent-582, score-0.238]
</p><p>91 There is an important difference however, in regard to the nature of the selected text for analysis: most studies in readability focus on differentiating good writings from noticeably bad writings, often involving machine generated text or those written  by ESL students. [sent-587, score-0.304]
</p><p>92 After all, all the books that we analyzed are written by expert writers who passed the scrutinizing eyes of publishers, hence it is reasonable to expect that the writing quality of even less successful books is respectful. [sent-589, score-1.428]
</p><p>93 Predicting success among academic papers: In the domain of academic papers, which belongs to the broad genre of non-fiction, the work of Sawyer et al. [sent-590, score-0.303]
</p><p>94 (2008) investigated the stylistic characteristics of award winning papers in marketing journals, and found that the readability plays an important role. [sent-591, score-0.431]
</p><p>95 Combined with our study which focuses on fiction and creative writing, it suggests that the recipe for successful publications can be very different depending on whether it belongs to fiction or nonfiction. [sent-592, score-0.743]
</p><p>96 (2012) is also somewhat relevant to ours in that their work included differentiating the writing styles of workshop papers from major conference papers, where the latter would be generally considered to be more suc-  cessful. [sent-594, score-0.333]
</p><p>97 9  Conclusion  We presented the first quantitative study that learns to predict the success ofliterary works based on their writing styles. [sent-595, score-0.362]
</p><p>98 Our empirical results demonstrated that statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effective in discriminating successful literature, achieving accuracy up to 84% in the novel domain and 89% in the movie domain. [sent-596, score-0.644]

<p>Author: Vikas Ganjigunte Ashok ; Song Feng ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Predicting the success of literary works is a curious question among publishers and aspiring writers alike. We examine the quantitative connection, if any, between writing style and successful literature. Based on novels over several different genres, we probe the predictive power of statistical stylometry in discriminating successful literary works, and identify characteristic stylistic elements that are more prominent in successful writings. Our study reports for the first time that statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effective in discriminating highly successful literature from less successful counterpart, achieving accuracy up to 84%.

In this work, we tackle the question of whether the author of a very short text can be successfully identified. We use Twitter as an experimental testbed. We introduce the concept of an author’s unique “signature”, and show that such signatures are typical of many authors when writing very short texts. We also present a new authorship attribution feature (“flexible patterns”) and demonstrate a significant improvement over our baselines.

<p>Author: Fandong Meng ; Jun Xie ; Linfeng Song ; Yajuan Lu ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel translation model, which simultaneously exploits the constituency and dependency trees on the source side, to combine the advantages of two types of trees. We take head-dependents relations of dependency trees as backbone and incorporate phrasal nodes of constituency trees as the source side of our translation rules, and the target side as strings. Our rules hold the property of long distance reorderings and the compatibility with phrases. Large-scale experimental results show that our model achieves significantly improvements over the constituency-to-string (+2.45 BLEU on average) and dependencyto-string (+0.91 BLEU on average) models, which only employ single type of trees, and significantly outperforms the state-of-theart hierarchical phrase-based model (+1.12 BLEU on average), on three Chinese-English NIST test sets.</p><p>6 0.070795141 <a title="178-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Latent_Word_Representations_for_Domain_Adaptation_using_Supervised_Word_Clustering.html">120 emnlp-2013-Learning Latent Word Representations for Domain Adaptation using Supervised Word Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Vikas Ganjigunte Ashok ; Song Feng ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Predicting the success of literary works is a curious question among publishers and aspiring writers alike. We examine the quantitative connection, if any, between writing style and successful literature. Based on novels over several different genres, we probe the predictive power of statistical stylometry in discriminating successful literary works, and identify characteristic stylistic elements that are more prominent in successful writings. Our study reports for the first time that statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effective in discriminating highly successful literature from less successful counterpart, achieving accuracy up to 84%. Closer analyses lead to several new insights into characteristics ofthe writing style in successful literature, including findings that are contrary to the conventional wisdom with respect to good writing style and readability. ,</p><p>2 0.64149731 <a title="178-lsi-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Authorship_Attribution_of_Micro-Messages.html">27 emnlp-2013-Authorship Attribution of Micro-Messages</a></p>
<p>Author: Roy Schwartz ; Oren Tsur ; Ari Rappoport ; Moshe Koppel</p><p>Abstract: Work on authorship attribution has traditionally focused on long texts. In this work, we tackle the question of whether the author of a very short text can be successfully identified. We use Twitter as an experimental testbed. We introduce the concept of an author’s unique “signature”, and show that such signatures are typical of many authors when writing very short texts. We also present a new authorship attribution feature (“flexible patterns”) and demonstrate a significant improvement over our baselines. Our results show that the author of a single tweet can be identified with good accuracy in an array of flavors of the authorship attribution task.</p><p>3 0.58020055 <a title="178-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatically_Detecting_and_Attributing_Indirect_Quotations.html">35 emnlp-2013-Automatically Detecting and Attributing Indirect Quotations</a></p>
<p>Author: Silvia Pareti ; Tim O'Keefe ; Ioannis Konstas ; James R. Curran ; Irena Koprinska</p><p>Abstract: Direct quotations are used for opinion mining and information extraction as they have an easy to extract span and they can be attributed to a speaker with high accuracy. However, simply focusing on direct quotations ignores around half of all reported speech, which is in the form of indirect or mixed speech. This work presents the first large-scale experiments in indirect and mixed quotation extraction and attribution. We propose two methods of extracting all quote types from news articles and evaluate them on two large annotated corpora, one of which is a contribution of this work. We further show that direct quotation attribution methods can be successfully applied to indirect and mixed quotation attribution.</p><p>4 0.53828704 <a title="178-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Assembling_the_Kazakh_Language_Corpus.html">26 emnlp-2013-Assembling the Kazakh Language Corpus</a></p>
<p>Author: Olzhas Makhambetov ; Aibek Makazhanov ; Zhandos Yessenbayev ; Bakhyt Matkarimov ; Islam Sabyrgaliyev ; Anuar Sharafudinov</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents the Kazakh Language Corpus (KLC), which is one of the first attempts made within a local research community to assemble a Kazakh corpus. KLC is designed to be a large scale corpus containing over 135 million words and conveying five stylistic genres: literary, publicistic, official, scientific and informal. Along with its primary part KLC comprises such parts as: (i) annotated sub-corpus, containing segmented documents encoded in the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) that marks complete morphological, syntactic, and structural characteristics of texts; (ii) as well as a sub-corpus with the annotated speech data. KLC has a web-based corpus management system that helps to navigate the data and retrieve necessary information. KLC is also open for contributors, who are willing to make suggestions, donate texts and help with annotation of existing materials.</p><p>5 0.52387977 <a title="178-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Detecting_Promotional_Content_in_Wikipedia.html">61 emnlp-2013-Detecting Promotional Content in Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Rebersek ; Mateja Verlic</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to automatic creation of anchor texts for hyperlinks in a document pointing to similar documents. Methods used in this approach rank parts of a document based on the similarity to a presumably related document. Ranks are then used to automatically construct the best anchor text for a link inside original document to the compared document. A number of different methods from information retrieval and natural language processing are adapted for this task. Automatically constructed anchor texts are manually evaluated in terms of relatedness to linked documents and compared to baseline consisting of originally inserted anchor texts. Additionally we use crowdsourcing for evaluation of original anchors and au- tomatically constructed anchors. Results show that our best adapted methods rival the precision of the baseline method.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.99767303 <a title="178-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Success_with_Style%3A_Using_Writing_Style_to_Predict_the_Success_of_Novels.html">178 emnlp-2013-Success with Style: Using Writing Style to Predict the Success of Novels</a></p>

<p>Author: Anais Cadilhac ; Nicholas Asher ; Farah Benamara ; Alex Lascarides</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a method that predicts which trades players execute during a winlose game. Our method uses data collected from chat negotiations of the game The Settlers of Catan and exploits the conversation to construct dynamically a partial model of each player’s preferences. This in turn yields equilibrium trading moves via principles from game theory. We compare our method against four baselines and show that tracking how preferences evolve through the dialogue and reasoning about equilibrium moves are both crucial to success.</p><p>4 0.99636048 <a title="178-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatic_Idiom_Identification_in_Wiktionary.html">32 emnlp-2013-Automatic Idiom Identification in Wiktionary</a></p>
<p>Author: Grace Muzny ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Online resources, such as Wiktionary, provide an accurate but incomplete source ofidiomatic phrases. In this paper, we study the problem of automatically identifying idiomatic dictionary entries with such resources. We train an idiom classifier on a newly gathered corpus of over 60,000 Wiktionary multi-word definitions, incorporating features that model whether phrase meanings are constructed compositionally. Experiments demonstrate that the learned classifier can provide high quality idiom labels, more than doubling the number of idiomatic entries from 7,764 to 18,155 at precision levels of over 65%. These gains also translate to idiom detection in sentences, by simply using known word sense disambiguation algorithms to match phrases to their definitions. In a set of Wiktionary definition example sentences, the more complete set of idioms boosts detection recall by over 28 percentage points.</p><p>5 0.99499249 <a title="178-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Identifying_Phrasal_Verbs_Using_Many_Bilingual_Corpora.html">96 emnlp-2013-Identifying Phrasal Verbs Using Many Bilingual Corpora</a></p>

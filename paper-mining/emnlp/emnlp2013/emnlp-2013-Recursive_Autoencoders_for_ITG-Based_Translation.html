In contrast to traditional approaches that directly introduce syntactic constraints to translation rules by explicitly decorating them with syntactic annotations, which often exacerbate the data sparsity problem and cause other problems, our approach keeps translation rules intact and factorizes the use of syntactic constraints through two separate models: 1) a syntax mismatch model that associates each nonterminal of a translation rule with a distribution of tags that is used to measure the degree of syntactic compatibility of the translation rule on source spans; 2) a syntax-based reordering model that predicts whether a pair of sibling constituents in the constituent parse tree of the source sentence should be reordered or not when translated to the target language. The features produced by both models are used as soft constraints to guide the translation process. Experiments on Chinese-English translation show that the proposed approach significantly improves a strong string-to-dependency translation system on multiple evaluation sets.</p><p>3 0.27916801 <a title="157-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Source-Side_Classifier_Preordering_for_Machine_Translation.html">175 emnlp-2013-Source-Side Classifier Preordering for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Uri Lerner ; Slav Petrov</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple and novel classifier-based preordering approach. Unlike existing preordering models, we train feature-rich discriminative classifiers that directly predict the target-side word order. Our approach combines the strengths of lexical reordering and syntactic preordering models by performing long-distance reorderings using the structure of the parse tree, while utilizing a discriminative model with a rich set of features, including lexical features. We present extensive experiments on 22 language pairs, including preordering into English from 7 other languages. We obtain improvements of up to 1.4 BLEU on language pairs in the WMT 2010 shared task. For languages from different families the improvements often exceed 2 BLEU. Many of these gains are also significant in human evaluations.</p><p>4 0.22883964 <a title="157-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Shift-Reduce_Word_Reordering_for_Machine_Translation.html">171 emnlp-2013-Shift-Reduce Word Reordering for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Bowen Zhou ; Bing Xiang</p><p>Abstract: Reordering poses one of the greatest challenges in Statistical Machine Translation research as the key contextual information may well be beyond the confine oftranslation units. We present the “Anchor Graph” (AG) model where we use a graph structure to model global contextual information that is crucial for reordering. The key ingredient of our AG model is the edges that capture the relationship between the reordering around a set of selected translation units, which we refer to as anchors. As the edges link anchors that may span multiple translation units at decoding time, our AG model effectively encodes global contextual information that is previously absent. We integrate our proposed model into a state-of-the-art translation system and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal in a largescale Chinese-to-English translation task.</p><p>6 0.17783004 <a title="157-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Left-to-Right_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation_with_Improved_Reordering.html">71 emnlp-2013-Efficient Left-to-Right Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation with Improved Reordering</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Alex Perelygin ; Jean Wu ; Jason Chuang ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Semantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning of longer phrases in a principled way. Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.</p><p>3 0.84626776 <a title="157-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Factored_Soft_Source_Syntactic_Constraints_for_Hierarchical_Machine_Translation.html">84 emnlp-2013-Factored Soft Source Syntactic Constraints for Hierarchical Machine Translation</a></p>

In contrast to traditional approaches that directly introduce syntactic constraints to translation rules by explicitly decorating them with syntactic annotations, which often exacerbate the data sparsity problem and cause other problems, our approach keeps translation rules intact and factorizes the use of syntactic constraints through two separate models: 1) a syntax mismatch model that associates each nonterminal of a translation rule with a distribution of tags that is used to measure the degree of syntactic compatibility of the translation rule on source spans; 2) a syntax-based reordering model that predicts whether a pair of sibling constituents in the constituent parse tree of the source sentence should be reordered or not when translated to the target language. The features produced by both models are used as soft constraints to guide the translation process. Experiments on Chinese-English translation show that the proposed approach significantly improves a strong string-to-dependency translation system on multiple evaluation sets.</p><p>4 0.8365497 <a title="157-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Shift-Reduce_Word_Reordering_for_Machine_Translation.html">171 emnlp-2013-Shift-Reduce Word Reordering for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Katsuhiko Hayashi ; Katsuhito Sudoh ; Hajime Tsukada ; Jun Suzuki ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel word reordering model that employs a shift-reduce parser for inversion transduction grammars. Our model uses rich syntax parsing features for word reordering and runs in linear time. We apply it to postordering of phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) for Japanese-to-English patent tasks. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a significant improvement of +3.1 BLEU scores against 30.15 BLEU scores of the baseline PBMT system.</p><p>5 0.83604956 <a title="157-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Semantically_Enhanced_Approach_to_Determine_Textual_Similarity.html">12 emnlp-2013-A Semantically Enhanced Approach to Determine Textual Similarity</a></p>
<p>Author: Eduardo Blanco ; Dan Moldovan</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to determine textual similarity. A layered methodology to transform text into logic forms is proposed, and semantic features are derived from a logic prover. Experimental results show that incorporating the semantic structure of sentences is beneficial. When training data is unavailable, scores obtained from the logic prover in an unsupervised manner outperform supervised methods.</p><p>6 0.8341583 <a title="157-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Detecting_Compositionality_of_Multi-Word_Expressions_using_Nearest_Neighbours_in_Vector_Space_Models.html">60 emnlp-2013-Detecting Compositionality of Multi-Word Expressions using Nearest Neighbours in Vector Space Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Karl Pichotta ; John DeNero</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of identifying multiword expressions in a language, focusing on English phrasal verbs. Our polyglot ranking approach integrates frequency statistics from translated corpora in 50 different languages. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that combining statistical evidence from many parallel corpora using a novel ranking-oriented boosting algorithm produces a comprehensive set ofEnglish phrasal verbs, achieving performance comparable to a human-curated set.</p><p>4 0.20880826 <a title="60-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Modeling_and_Learning_Semantic_Co-Compositionality_through_Prototype_Projections_and_Neural_Networks.html">134 emnlp-2013-Modeling and Learning Semantic Co-Compositionality through Prototype Projections and Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Masashi Tsubaki ; Kevin Duh ; Masashi Shimbo ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel vector space model for semantic co-compositionality. Inspired by Generative Lexicon Theory (Pustejovsky, 1995), our goal is a compositional model where both predicate and argument are allowed to modify each others’ meaning representations while generating the overall semantics. This readily addresses some major challenges with current vector space models, notably the polysemy issue and the use of one representation per word type. We implement cocompositionality using prototype projections on predicates/arguments and show that this is effective in adapting their word representations. We further cast the model as a neural network and propose an unsupervised algorithm to jointly train word representations with co-compositionality. The model achieves the best result to date (ρ = 0.47) on the semantic similarity task of transitive verbs (Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011).</p><p>5 0.20690277 <a title="60-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Understanding_and_Quantifying_Creativity_in_Lexical_Composition.html">191 emnlp-2013-Understanding and Quantifying Creativity in Lexical Composition</a></p>

<p>Author: Eva Maria Vecchi ; Roberto Zamparelli ; Marco Baroni</p><p>Abstract: In this study, we use compositional distributional semantic methods to investigate restrictions in adjective ordering. Specifically, we focus on properties distinguishing AdjectiveAdjective-Noun phrases in which there is flexibility in the adjective ordering from those bound to a rigid order. We explore a number of measures extracted from the distributional representation of AAN phrases which may indicate a word order restriction. We find that we are able to distinguish the relevant classes and the correct order based primarily on the degree of modification of the adjectives. Our results offer fresh insight into the semantic properties that determine adjective ordering, building a bridge between syntax and distributional semantics.</p><p>5 0.63546795 <a title="60-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Understanding_and_Quantifying_Creativity_in_Lexical_Composition.html">191 emnlp-2013-Understanding and Quantifying Creativity in Lexical Composition</a></p>

<p>Author: Kazuma Hashimoto ; Makoto Miwa ; Yoshimasa Tsuruoka ; Takashi Chikayama</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a recursive neural network (RNN) model that works on a syntactic tree. Our model differs from previous RNN models in that the model allows for an explicit weighting of important phrases for the target task. We also propose to average parameters in training. Our experimental results on semantic relation classification show that both phrase categories and task-specific weighting significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the model. We also show that averaging the model parameters is effective in stabilizing the learning and improves generalization capacity. The proposed model marks scores competitive with state-of-the-art RNN-based models.</p><p>4 0.61763835 <a title="60-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-The_Effects_of_Syntactic_Features_in_Automatic_Prediction_of_Morphology.html">181 emnlp-2013-The Effects of Syntactic Features in Automatic Prediction of Morphology</a></p>
<p>Author: Wolfgang Seeker ; Jonas Kuhn</p><p>Abstract: Morphology and syntax interact considerably in many languages and language processing should pay attention to these interdependencies. We analyze the effect of syntactic features when used in automatic morphology prediction on four typologically different languages. We show that predicting morphology for languages with highly ambiguous word forms profits from taking the syntactic context of words into account and results in state-ofthe-art models.</p><p>5 0.61553425 <a title="60-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Naive_Bayes_Word_Sense_Induction.html">138 emnlp-2013-Naive Bayes Word Sense Induction</a></p>

The extended model incorporates the idea the words closer to the target word are more relevant in predicting its sense.

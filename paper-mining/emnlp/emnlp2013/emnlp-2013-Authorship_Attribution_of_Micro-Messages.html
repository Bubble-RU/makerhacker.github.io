<p>Author: Qiming Diao ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of social media, Twitter has become one of the most widely adopted platforms for people to post short and instant message. On the one hand, people tweets about their daily lives, and on the other hand, when major events happen, people also follow and tweet about them. Moreover, people’s posting behaviors on events are often closely tied to their personal interests. In this paper, we try to model topics, events and users on Twitter in a unified way. We propose a model which combines an LDA-like topic model and the Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Process to capture topics and events. We further propose a duration-based regularization component to find bursty events. We also propose to use event-topic affinity vectors to model the asso- . ciation between events and topics. Our experiments shows that our model can accurately identify meaningful events and the event-topic affinity vectors are effective for event recommendation and grouping events by topics.</p><p>3 0.24413283 <a title="27-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Sarcasm_as_Contrast_between_a_Positive_Sentiment_and_Negative_Situation.html">163 emnlp-2013-Sarcasm as Contrast between a Positive Sentiment and Negative Situation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ellen Riloff ; Ashequl Qadir ; Prafulla Surve ; Lalindra De Silva ; Nathan Gilbert ; Ruihong Huang</p><p>Abstract: A common form of sarcasm on Twitter consists of a positive sentiment contrasted with a negative situation. For example, many sarcastic tweets include a positive sentiment, such as “love” or “enjoy”, followed by an expression that describes an undesirable activity or state (e.g., “taking exams” or “being ignored”). We have developed a sarcasm recognizer to identify this type of sarcasm in tweets. We present a novel bootstrapping algorithm that automatically learns lists of positive sentiment phrases and negative situation phrases from sarcastic tweets. We show that identifying contrasting contexts using the phrases learned through bootstrapping yields improved recall for sarcasm recognition.</p><p>4 0.21776143 <a title="27-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Is_Twitter_A_Better_Corpus_for_Measuring_Sentiment_Similarity%3F.html">109 emnlp-2013-Is Twitter A Better Corpus for Measuring Sentiment Similarity?</a></p>

<p>Author: Morgane Ciot ; Morgan Sonderegger ; Derek Ruths</p><p>Abstract: While much work has considered the problem of latent attribute inference for users of social media such as Twitter, little has been done on non-English-based content and users. Here, we conduct the first assessment of latent attribute inference in languages beyond English, focusing on gender inference. We find that the gender inference problem in quite diverse languages can be addressed using existing machinery. Further, accuracy gains can be made by taking language-specific features into account. We identify languages with complex orthography, such as Japanese, as difficult for existing methods, suggesting a valuable direction for future research.</p><p>6 0.15935993 <a title="27-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploring_Demographic_Language_Variations_to_Improve_Multilingual_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Social_Media.html">81 emnlp-2013-Exploring Demographic Language Variations to Improve Multilingual Sentiment Analysis in Social Media</a></p>

<p>Author: Jinpeng Wang ; Wayne Xin Zhao ; Haitian Wei ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Hot trends are likely to bring new business opportunities. For example, “Air Pollution” might lead to a significant increase of the sales of related products, e.g., mouth mask. For ecommerce companies, it is very important to make rapid and correct response to these hot trends in order to improve product sales. In this paper, we take the initiative to study the task of how to identify trend related products. The major novelty of our work is that we automatically learn commercial intents revealed from microblogs. We carefully construct a data collection for this task and present quite a few insightful findings. In order to solve this problem, we further propose a graph based method, which jointly models relevance and associativity. We perform extensive experiments and the results showed that our methods are very effective.</p><p>6 0.45382124 <a title="27-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Log-Linear_Model_for_Unsupervised_Text_Normalization.html">9 emnlp-2013-A Log-Linear Model for Unsupervised Text Normalization</a></p>

<p>Author: Oier Lopez de Lacalle ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an unsupervised approach to relational information extraction. Our model partitions tuples representing an observed syntactic relationship between two named entities (e.g., “X was born in Y” and “X is from Y”) into clusters corresponding to underlying semantic relation types (e.g., BornIn, Located). Our approach incorporates general domain knowledge which we encode as First Order Logic rules and automatically combine with a topic model developed specifically for the relation extraction task. Evaluation results on the ACE 2007 English Relation Detection and Categorization (RDC) task show that our model outperforms competitive unsupervised approaches by a wide margin and is able to produce clusters shaped by both the data and the rules.</p><p>3 0.58142418 <a title="27-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Improving_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Word_Class_Models.html">104 emnlp-2013-Improving Statistical Machine Translation with Word Class Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Margaret Mitchell ; Jacqui Aguilar ; Theresa Wilson ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to sentiment analysis for a low resource setting. The intuition behind this work is that sentiment expressed towards an entity, targeted sentiment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment expressed across the entity. This representation allows us to model sentiment detection as a sequence tagging problem, jointly discovering people and organizations along with whether there is sentiment directed towards them. We compare performance in both Spanish and English on microblog data, using only a sentiment lexicon as an external resource. By leveraging linguisticallyinformed features within conditional random fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empirical risk, our best models in Spanish significantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach around 90% accuracy on the combined task of named entity recognition and sentiment prediction. Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.</p><p>6 0.54646832 <a title="27-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Overcoming_the_Lack_of_Parallel_Data_in_Sentence_Compression.html">149 emnlp-2013-Overcoming the Lack of Parallel Data in Sentence Compression</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Auli ; Michel Galley ; Chris Quirk ; Geoffrey Zweig</p><p>Abstract: We present a joint language and translation model based on a recurrent neural network which predicts target words based on an unbounded history of both source and target words. The weaker independence assumptions of this model result in a vastly larger search space compared to related feedforward-based language or translation models. We tackle this issue with a new lattice rescoring algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically. Our joint model builds on a well known recurrent neural network language model (Mikolov, 2012) augmented by a layer of additional inputs from the source language. We show competitive accuracy compared to the traditional channel model features. Our best results improve the output of a system trained on WMT 2012 French-English data by up to 1.5 BLEU, and by 1.1BLEU on average across several test sets.</p><p>3 0.17084129 <a title="59-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatic_Feature_Engineering_for_Answer_Selection_and_Extraction.html">31 emnlp-2013-Automatic Feature Engineering for Answer Selection and Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Aliaksei Severyn ; Alessandro Moschitti</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for automatically engineering features for two important tasks of question answering: answer sentence selection and answer extraction. We represent question and answer sentence pairs with linguistic structures enriched by semantic information, where the latter is produced by automatic classifiers, e.g., question classifier and Named Entity Recognizer. Tree kernels applied to such structures enable a simple way to generate highly discriminative structural features that combine syntactic and semantic information encoded in the input trees. We conduct experiments on a public benchmark from TREC to compare with previous systems for answer sentence selection and answer extraction. The results show that our models greatly improve on the state of the art, e.g., up to 22% on F1 (relative improvement) for answer extraction, while using no additional resources and no manual feature engineering.</p><p>4 0.16586913 <a title="59-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Multi-Relational_Latent_Semantic_Analysis.html">137 emnlp-2013-Multi-Relational Latent Semantic Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai-Wei Chang ; Wen-tau Yih ; Christopher Meek</p><p>Abstract: We present Multi-Relational Latent Semantic Analysis (MRLSA) which generalizes Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). MRLSA provides an elegant approach to combining multiple relations between words by constructing a 3-way tensor. Similar to LSA, a lowrank approximation of the tensor is derived using a tensor decomposition. Each word in the vocabulary is thus represented by a vector in the latent semantic space and each relation is captured by a latent square matrix. The degree of two words having a specific relation can then be measured through simple linear algebraic operations. We demonstrate that by integrating multiple relations from both homogeneous and heterogeneous information sources, MRLSA achieves state- of-the-art performance on existing benchmark datasets for two relations, antonymy and is-a.</p><p>5 0.11855724 <a title="59-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Simple_Customization_of_Recursive_Neural_Networks_for_Semantic_Relation_Classification.html">172 emnlp-2013-Simple Customization of Recursive Neural Networks for Semantic Relation Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Kazuma Hashimoto ; Makoto Miwa ; Yoshimasa Tsuruoka ; Takashi Chikayama</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a recursive neural network (RNN) model that works on a syntactic tree. Our model differs from previous RNN models in that the model allows for an explicit weighting of important phrases for the target task. We also propose to average parameters in training. Our experimental results on semantic relation classification show that both phrase categories and task-specific weighting significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the model. We also show that averaging the model parameters is effective in stabilizing the learning and improves generalization capacity. The proposed model marks scores competitive with state-of-the-art RNN-based models.</p><p>6 0.11016662 <a title="59-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-MCTest%3A_A_Challenge_Dataset_for_the_Open-Domain_Machine_Comprehension_of_Text.html">126 emnlp-2013-MCTest: A Challenge Dataset for the Open-Domain Machine Comprehension of Text</a></p>

<p>Author: Dimitri Kartsaklis ; Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has shown that compositionaldistributional models using element-wise operations on contextual word vectors benefit from the introduction of a prior disambiguation step. The purpose of this paper is to generalise these ideas to tensor-based models, where relational words such as verbs and adjectives are represented by linear maps (higher order tensors) acting on a number of arguments (vectors). We propose disambiguation algorithms for a number of tensor-based models, which we then test on a variety of tasks. The results show that disambiguation can provide better compositional representation even for the case of tensor-based models. Further- more, we confirm previous findings regarding the positive effect of disambiguation on vector mixture models, and we compare the effectiveness of the two approaches.</p><p>6 0.44721296 <a title="59-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Simple_Customization_of_Recursive_Neural_Networks_for_Semantic_Relation_Classification.html">172 emnlp-2013-Simple Customization of Recursive Neural Networks for Semantic Relation Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Alex Perelygin ; Jean Wu ; Jason Chuang ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Semantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning of longer phrases in a principled way. Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.</p><p>3 0.50840366 <a title="59-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploring_the_Utility_of_Joint_Morphological_and_Syntactic_Learning_from_Child-directed_Speech.html">83 emnlp-2013-Exploring the Utility of Joint Morphological and Syntactic Learning from Child-directed Speech</a></p>
<p>Author: Stella Frank ; Frank Keller ; Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: Frank Keller keller@ inf .ed .ac .uk Sharon Goldwater sgwater@ inf .ed .ac .uk ILCC, School of Informatics University of Edinburgh Edinburgh, EH8 9AB, UK interactions are often (but not necessarily) synergisChildren learn various levels of linguistic structure concurrently, yet most existing models of language acquisition deal with only a single level of structure, implicitly assuming a sequential learning process. Developing models that learn multiple levels simultaneously can provide important insights into how these levels might interact synergistically dur- ing learning. Here, we present a model that jointly induces syntactic categories and morphological segmentations by combining two well-known models for the individual tasks. We test on child-directed utterances in English and Spanish and compare to single-task baselines. In the morphologically poorer language (English), the model improves morphological segmentation, while in the morphologically richer language (Spanish), it leads to better syntactic categorization. These results provide further evidence that joint learning is useful, but also suggest that the benefits may be different for typologically different languages.</p><p>4 0.50562936 <a title="59-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Prior_Disambiguation_of_Word_Tensors_for_Constructing_Sentence_Vectors.html">154 emnlp-2013-Prior Disambiguation of Word Tensors for Constructing Sentence Vectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Dimitri Kartsaklis ; Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has shown that compositionaldistributional models using element-wise operations on contextual word vectors benefit from the introduction of a prior disambiguation step. The purpose of this paper is to generalise these ideas to tensor-based models, where relational words such as verbs and adjectives are represented by linear maps (higher order tensors) acting on a number of arguments (vectors). We propose disambiguation algorithms for a number of tensor-based models, which we then test on a variety of tasks. The results show that disambiguation can provide better compositional representation even for the case of tensor-based models. Further- more, we confirm previous findings regarding the positive effect of disambiguation on vector mixture models, and we compare the effectiveness of the two approaches.</p><p>5 0.50383484 <a title="59-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Translating_into_Morphologically_Rich_Languages_with_Synthetic_Phrases.html">186 emnlp-2013-Translating into Morphologically Rich Languages with Synthetic Phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Chahuneau ; Eva Schlinger ; Noah A. Smith ; Chris Dyer</p><p>Abstract: Translation into morphologically rich languages is an important but recalcitrant problem in MT. We present a simple and effective approach that deals with the problem in two phases. First, a discriminative model is learned to predict inflections of target words from rich source-side annotations. Then, this model is used to create additional sentencespecific word- and phrase-level translations that are added to a standard translation model as “synthetic” phrases. Our approach relies on morphological analysis of the target language, but we show that an unsupervised Bayesian model of morphology can successfully be used in place of a supervised analyzer. We report significant improvements in translation quality when translating from English to Russian, Hebrew and Swahili.</p><p>6 0.50180238 <a title="59-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatic_Feature_Engineering_for_Answer_Selection_and_Extraction.html">31 emnlp-2013-Automatic Feature Engineering for Answer Selection and Extraction</a></p>

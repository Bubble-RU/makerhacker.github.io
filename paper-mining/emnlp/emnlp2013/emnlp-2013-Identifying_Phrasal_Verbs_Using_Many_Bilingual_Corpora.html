<p>Author: Xuchen Yao ; Benjamin Van Durme ; Chris Callison-Burch ; Peter Clark</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel discriminative model for phrase-based monolingual alignment using a semi-Markov CRF. Our model achieves stateof-the-art alignment accuracy on two phrasebased alignment datasets (RTE and paraphrase), while doing significantly better than other strong baselines in both non-identical alignment and phrase-only alignment. Additional experiments highlight the potential benefit of our alignment model to RTE, paraphrase identification and question answering, where even a naive application of our model’s alignment score approaches the state ofthe art.</p><p>3 0.27794877 <a title="96-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Translation_with_Source_Constituency_and_Dependency_Trees.html">187 emnlp-2013-Translation with Source Constituency and Dependency Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Fandong Meng ; Jun Xie ; Linfeng Song ; Yajuan Lu ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel translation model, which simultaneously exploits the constituency and dependency trees on the source side, to combine the advantages of two types of trees. We take head-dependents relations of dependency trees as backbone and incorporate phrasal nodes of constituency trees as the source side of our translation rules, and the target side as strings. Our rules hold the property of long distance reorderings and the compatibility with phrases. Large-scale experimental results show that our model achieves significantly improvements over the constituency-to-string (+2.45 BLEU on average) and dependencyto-string (+0.91 BLEU on average) models, which only employ single type of trees, and significantly outperforms the state-of-theart hierarchical phrase-based model (+1.12 BLEU on average), on three Chinese-English NIST test sets.</p><p>4 0.25956523 <a title="96-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatic_Idiom_Identification_in_Wiktionary.html">32 emnlp-2013-Automatic Idiom Identification in Wiktionary</a></p>

<p>Author: Dhouha Bouamor ; Adrian Popescu ; Nasredine Semmar ; Pierre Zweigenbaum</p><p>Abstract: Bilingual lexicons are central components of machine translation and cross-lingual information retrieval systems. Their manual construction requires strong expertise in both languages involved and is a costly process. Several automatic methods were proposed as an alternative but they often rely on resources available in a limited number of languages and their performances are still far behind the quality of manual translations. We introduce a novel approach to the creation of specific domain bilingual lexicon that relies on Wikipedia. This massively multilingual encyclopedia makes it possible to create lexicons for a large number of language pairs. Wikipedia is used to extract domains in each language, to link domains between languages and to create generic translation dictionaries. The approach is tested on four specialized domains and is compared to three state of the art approaches using two language pairs: FrenchEnglish and Romanian-English. The newly introduced method compares favorably to existing methods in all configurations tested.</p><p>3 0.56227064 <a title="96-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Understanding_and_Quantifying_Creativity_in_Lexical_Composition.html">191 emnlp-2013-Understanding and Quantifying Creativity in Lexical Composition</a></p>
<p>Author: Polina Kuznetsova ; Jianfu Chen ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Why do certain combinations of words such as “disadvantageous peace ” or “metal to the petal” appeal to our minds as interesting expressions with a sense of creativity, while other phrases such as “quiet teenager”, or “geometrical base ” not as much? We present statistical explorations to understand the characteristics of lexical compositions that give rise to the perception of being original, interesting, and at times even artistic. We first examine various correlates of perceived creativity based on information theoretic measures and the connotation of words, then present experiments based on supervised learning that give us further insights on how different aspects of lexical composition collectively contribute to the perceived creativity.</p><p>4 0.56096351 <a title="96-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatic_Idiom_Identification_in_Wiktionary.html">32 emnlp-2013-Automatic Idiom Identification in Wiktionary</a></p>

<p>Author: Peng Li ; Yang Liu ; Maosong Sun</p><p>Abstract: While inversion transduction grammar (ITG) is well suited for modeling ordering shifts between languages, how to make applying the two reordering rules (i.e., straight and inverted) dependent on actual blocks being merged remains a challenge. Unlike previous work that only uses boundary words, we propose to use recursive autoencoders to make full use of the entire merging blocks alternatively. The recursive autoencoders are capable of generating vector space representations for variable-sized phrases, which enable predicting orders to exploit syntactic and semantic information from a neural language modeling’s perspective. Experiments on the NIST 2008 dataset show that our system significantly improves over the MaxEnt classifier by 1.07 BLEU points.</p><p>6 0.55966616 <a title="96-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Study_on_Bootstrapping_Bilingual_Vector_Spaces_from_Non-Parallel_Data_%28and_Nothing_Else%29.html">13 emnlp-2013-A Study on Bootstrapping Bilingual Vector Spaces from Non-Parallel Data (and Nothing Else)</a></p>

<p>Author: Min Xiao ; Feipeng Zhao ; Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation has been popularly studied on exploiting labeled information from a source domain to learn a prediction model in a target domain. In this paper, we develop a novel representation learning approach to address domain adaptation for text classification with automatically induced discriminative latent features, which are generalizable across domains while informative to the prediction task. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical multinomial Naive Bayes model with latent variables to conduct supervised word clustering on labeled documents from both source and target domains, and then use the produced cluster distribution of each word as its latent feature representation for domain adaptation. We train this latent graphical model us- ing a simple expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We empirically evaluate the proposed method with both cross-domain document categorization tasks on Reuters-21578 dataset and cross-domain sentiment classification tasks on Amazon product review dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance compared with alternative methods.</p><p>3 0.10720924 <a title="196-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Open_Domain_Targeted_Sentiment.html">143 emnlp-2013-Open Domain Targeted Sentiment</a></p>
<p>Author: Margaret Mitchell ; Jacqui Aguilar ; Theresa Wilson ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to sentiment analysis for a low resource setting. The intuition behind this work is that sentiment expressed towards an entity, targeted sentiment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment expressed across the entity. This representation allows us to model sentiment detection as a sequence tagging problem, jointly discovering people and organizations along with whether there is sentiment directed towards them. We compare performance in both Spanish and English on microblog data, using only a sentiment lexicon as an external resource. By leveraging linguisticallyinformed features within conditional random fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empirical risk, our best models in Spanish significantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach around 90% accuracy on the combined task of named entity recognition and sentiment prediction. Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.</p><p>4 0.086653501 <a title="196-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Deep_Models_for_Semantic_Compositionality_Over_a_Sentiment_Treebank.html">158 emnlp-2013-Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Alex Perelygin ; Jean Wu ; Jason Chuang ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Semantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning of longer phrases in a principled way. Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.</p><p>5 0.073283412 <a title="196-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatic_Feature_Engineering_for_Answer_Selection_and_Extraction.html">31 emnlp-2013-Automatic Feature Engineering for Answer Selection and Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Aliaksei Severyn ; Alessandro Moschitti</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for automatically engineering features for two important tasks of question answering: answer sentence selection and answer extraction. We represent question and answer sentence pairs with linguistic structures enriched by semantic information, where the latter is produced by automatic classifiers, e.g., question classifier and Named Entity Recognizer. Tree kernels applied to such structures enable a simple way to generate highly discriminative structural features that combine syntactic and semantic information encoded in the input trees. We conduct experiments on a public benchmark from TREC to compare with previous systems for answer sentence selection and answer extraction. The results show that our models greatly improve on the state of the art, e.g., up to 22% on F1 (relative improvement) for answer extraction, while using no additional resources and no manual feature engineering.</p><p>6 0.072596997 <a title="196-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Question_Difficulty_Estimation_in_Community_Question_Answering_Services.html">155 emnlp-2013-Question Difficulty Estimation in Community Question Answering Services</a></p>

<p>Author: Sida Wang ; Mengqiu Wang ; Stefan Wager ; Percy Liang ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: NLP models have many and sparse features, and regularization is key for balancing model overfitting versus underfitting. A recently repopularized form of regularization is to generate fake training data by repeatedly adding noise to real data. We reinterpret this noising as an explicit regularizer, and approximate it with a second-order formula that can be used during training without actually generating fake data. We show how to apply this method to structured prediction using multinomial logistic regression and linear-chain CRFs. We tackle the key challenge of developing a dynamic program to compute the gradient of the regularizer efficiently. The regularizer is a sum over inputs, so we can estimate it more accurately via a semi-supervised or transductive extension. Applied to text classification and NER, our method provides a > 1% absolute performance gain over use of standard L2 regularization.</p><p>3 0.49098909 <a title="196-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Open_Domain_Targeted_Sentiment.html">143 emnlp-2013-Open Domain Targeted Sentiment</a></p>

<p>Author: Vikas Ganjigunte Ashok ; Song Feng ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Predicting the success of literary works is a curious question among publishers and aspiring writers alike. We examine the quantitative connection, if any, between writing style and successful literature. Based on novels over several different genres, we probe the predictive power of statistical stylometry in discriminating successful literary works, and identify characteristic stylistic elements that are more prominent in successful writings. Our study reports for the first time that statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effective in discriminating highly successful literature from less successful counterpart, achieving accuracy up to 84%. Closer analyses lead to several new insights into characteristics ofthe writing style in successful literature, including findings that are contrary to the conventional wisdom with respect to good writing style and readability. ,</p><p>6 0.44469625 <a title="196-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Sentiment_Analysis%3A_How_to_Derive_Prior_Polarities_from_SentiWordNet.html">170 emnlp-2013-Sentiment Analysis: How to Derive Prior Polarities from SentiWordNet</a></p>

The model is trained on a set of high frequency relations extracted from the Penn Discourse Treebank and achieves an accuracy of 86.6%. Analysis of the results reveals that the most informative features relate to the discourse dependencies between sequences of coherence relations in the text.

We reinterpret this noising as an explicit regularizer, and approximate it with a second-order formula that can be used during training without actually generating fake data. We show how to apply this method to structured prediction using multinomial logistic regression and linear-chain CRFs. We tackle the key challenge of developing a dynamic program to compute the gradient of the regularizer efficiently. The regularizer is a sum over inputs, so we can estimate it more accurately via a semi-supervised or transductive extension. Applied to text classification and NER, our method provides a > 1% absolute performance gain over use of standard L2 regularization.</p><p>5 0.936171 <a title="196-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Recurrent_Continuous_Translation_Models.html">156 emnlp-2013-Recurrent Continuous Translation Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Nal Kalchbrenner ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a class of probabilistic continuous translation models called Recurrent Continuous Translation Models that are purely based on continuous representations for words, phrases and sentences and do not rely on alignments or phrasal translation units. The models have a generation and a conditioning aspect. The generation of the translation is modelled with a target Recurrent Language Model, whereas the conditioning on the source sentence is modelled with a Convolutional Sentence Model. Through various experiments, we show first that our models obtain a perplexity with respect to gold translations that is > 43% lower than that of stateof-the-art alignment-based translation models. Secondly, we show that they are remarkably sensitive to the word order, syntax, and meaning of the source sentence despite lacking alignments. Finally we show that they match a state-of-the-art system when rescoring n-best lists of translations.</p><p>6 0.92495304 <a title="196-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Growing_Multi-Domain_Glossaries_from_a_Few_Seeds_using_Probabilistic_Topic_Models.html">92 emnlp-2013-Growing Multi-Domain Glossaries from a Few Seeds using Probabilistic Topic Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicholas FitzGerald ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to referring expression generation, casting it as a density estimation problem where the goal is to learn distributions over logical expressions identifying sets of objects in the world. Despite an extremely large space of possible expressions, we demonstrate effective learning of a globally normalized log-linear distribution. This learning is enabled by a new, multi-stage approximate inference technique that uses a pruning model to construct only the most likely logical forms. We train and evaluate the approach on a new corpus of references to sets of visual objects. Experiments show the approach is able to learn accurate models, which generate over 87% of the expressions people used. Additionally, on the previously studied special case of single object reference, we show a 35% relative error reduction over previous state of the art.</p><p>3 0.16856138 <a title="185-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Language_Models_for_Visual_Recognition.html">78 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Language Models for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Dieu-Thu Le ; Jasper Uijlings ; Raffaella Bernardi</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning language models from large text corpora has been widely studied within the computational linguistic community. However, little is known about the performance of these language models when applied to the computer vision domain. In this work, we compare representative models: a window-based model, a topic model, a distributional memory and a commonsense knowledge database, ConceptNet, in two visual recognition scenarios: human action recognition and object prediction. We examine whether the knowledge extracted from texts through these models are compatible to the knowledge represented in images. We determine the usefulness of different language models in aiding the two visual recognition tasks. The study shows that the language models built from general text corpora can be used instead of expensive annotated images and even outperform the image model when testing on a big general dataset.</p><p>4 0.15559126 <a title="185-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Image_Description_using_Visual_Dependency_Representations.html">98 emnlp-2013-Image Description using Visual Dependency Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Desmond Elliott ; Frank Keller</p><p>Abstract: Describing the main event of an image involves identifying the objects depicted and predicting the relationships between them. Previous approaches have represented images as unstructured bags of regions, which makes it difficult to accurately predict meaningful relationships between regions. In this paper, we introduce visual dependency representations to capture the relationships between the objects in an image, and hypothesize that this representation can improve image description. We test this hypothesis using a new data set of region-annotated images, associated with visual dependency representations and gold-standard descriptions. We describe two template-based description generation models that operate over visual dependency representations. In an image descrip- tion task, we find that these models outperform approaches that rely on object proximity or corpus information to generate descriptions on both automatic measures and on human judgements.</p><p>5 0.12424228 <a title="185-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Multimodal_LDA_Model_integrating_Textual%2C_Cognitive_and_Visual_Modalities.html">11 emnlp-2013-A Multimodal LDA Model integrating Textual, Cognitive and Visual Modalities</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Roller ; Sabine Schulte im Walde</p><p>Abstract: Recent investigations into grounded models of language have shown that holistic views of language and perception can provide higher performance than independent views. In this work, we improve a two-dimensional multimodal version of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Andrews et al., 2009) in various ways. (1) We outperform text-only models in two different evaluations, and demonstrate that low-level visual features are directly compatible with the existing model. (2) We present a novel way to integrate visual features into the LDA model using unsupervised clusters of images. The clusters are directly interpretable and improve on our evaluation tasks. (3) We provide two novel ways to extend the bimodal mod- els to support three or more modalities. We find that the three-, four-, and five-dimensional models significantly outperform models using only one or two modalities, and that nontextual modalities each provide separate, disjoint knowledge that cannot be forced into a shared, latent structure.</p><p>6 0.12419114 <a title="185-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Predicting_the_Resolution_of_Referring_Expressions_from_User_Behavior.html">153 emnlp-2013-Predicting the Resolution of Referring Expressions from User Behavior</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiwei Li ; Myle Ott ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has developed supervised methods for detecting deceptive opinion spam— fake reviews written to sound authentic and deliberately mislead readers. And whereas past work has focused on identifying individual fake reviews, this paper aims to identify offerings (e.g., hotels) that contain fake reviews. We introduce a semi-supervised manifold ranking algorithm for this task, which relies on a small set of labeled individual reviews for training. Then, in the absence of gold standard labels (at an offering level), we introduce a novel evaluation procedure that ranks artificial instances of real offerings, where each artificial offering contains a known number of injected deceptive reviews. Experiments on a novel dataset of hotel reviews show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-art learning baselines.</p><p>3 0.60828876 <a title="185-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Orthonormal_Explicit_Topic_Analysis_for_Cross-Lingual_Document_Matching.html">148 emnlp-2013-Orthonormal Explicit Topic Analysis for Cross-Lingual Document Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: John Philip McCrae ; Philipp Cimiano ; Roman Klinger</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modelling has applications in machine translation, word sense disambiguation and terminology alignment. Multilingual extensions of approaches based on latent (LSI), generative (LDA, PLSI) as well as explicit (ESA) topic modelling can induce an interlingual topic space allowing documents in different languages to be mapped into the same space and thus to be compared across languages. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines latent and explicit topic modelling approaches in the sense that it builds on a set of explicitly defined topics, but then computes latent relations between these. Thus, the method combines the benefits of both explicit and latent topic modelling approaches. We show that on a crosslingual mate retrieval task, our model significantly outperforms LDA, LSI, and ESA, as well as a baseline that translates every word in a document into the target language.</p><p>4 0.58604741 <a title="185-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Distributions_over_Logical_Forms_for_Referring_Expression_Generation.html">119 emnlp-2013-Learning Distributions over Logical Forms for Referring Expression Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas FitzGerald ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to referring expression generation, casting it as a density estimation problem where the goal is to learn distributions over logical expressions identifying sets of objects in the world. Despite an extremely large space of possible expressions, we demonstrate effective learning of a globally normalized log-linear distribution. This learning is enabled by a new, multi-stage approximate inference technique that uses a pruning model to construct only the most likely logical forms. We train and evaluate the approach on a new corpus of references to sets of visual objects. Experiments show the approach is able to learn accurate models, which generate over 87% of the expressions people used. Additionally, on the previously studied special case of single object reference, we show a 35% relative error reduction over previous state of the art.</p><p>5 0.55058247 <a title="185-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Application_of_Localized_Similarity_for_Web_Documents.html">24 emnlp-2013-Application of Localized Similarity for Web Documents</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Rebersek ; Mateja Verlic</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to automatic creation of anchor texts for hyperlinks in a document pointing to similar documents. Methods used in this approach rank parts of a document based on the similarity to a presumably related document. Ranks are then used to automatically construct the best anchor text for a link inside original document to the compared document. A number of different methods from information retrieval and natural language processing are adapted for this task. Automatically constructed anchor texts are manually evaluated in terms of relatedness to linked documents and compared to baseline consisting of originally inserted anchor texts. Additionally we use crowdsourcing for evaluation of original anchors and au- tomatically constructed anchors. Results show that our best adapted methods rival the precision of the baseline method.</p><p>6 0.5415532 <a title="185-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Dynamic_Feature_Selection_for_Dependency_Parsing.html">66 emnlp-2013-Dynamic Feature Selection for Dependency Parsing</a></p>

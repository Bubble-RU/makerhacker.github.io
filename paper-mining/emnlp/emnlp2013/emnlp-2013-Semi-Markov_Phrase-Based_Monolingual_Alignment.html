<p>Author: Tian Xia ; Zongcheng Ji ; Shaodan Zhai ; Yidong Chen ; Qun Liu ; Shaojun Wang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization framework which supports heterogeneous information sources to improve alignment in machine translation system combination techniques. In this area, most of techniques usually utilize confusion networks (CN) as their central data structure to compact an exponential number of an potential hypotheses, and because better hypothesis alignment may benefit constructing better quality confusion networks, it is natural to add more useful information to improve alignment results. However, these information may be heterogeneous, so the widely-used Viterbi algorithm for searching the best alignment may not apply here. In the multi-objective optimization framework, each information source is viewed as an independent objective, and a new goal of improving all objectives can be searched by mature algorithms. The solutions from this framework, termed Pareto optimal solutions, are then combined to construct confusion networks. Experiments on two Chinese-to-English translation datasets show significant improvements, 0.97 and 1.06 BLEU points over a strong Indirected Hidden Markov Model-based (IHMM) system, and 4.75 and 3.53 points over the best single machine translation systems.</p><p>4 0.21409082 <a title="167-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Paraphrasing_4_Microblog_Normalization.html">151 emnlp-2013-Paraphrasing 4 Microblog Normalization</a></p>
<p>Author: Wang Ling ; Chris Dyer ; Alan W Black ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: Compared to the edited genres that have played a central role in NLP research, microblog texts use a more informal register with nonstandard lexical items, abbreviations, and free orthographic variation. When confronted with such input, conventional text analysis tools often perform poorly. Normalization replacing orthographically or lexically idiosyncratic forms with more standard variants can improve performance. We propose a method for learning normalization rules from machine translations of a parallel corpus of microblog messages. To validate the utility of our approach, we evaluate extrinsically, showing that normalizing English tweets and then translating improves translation quality (compared to translating unnormalized text) using three standard web translation services as well as a phrase-based translation system trained — — on parallel microblog data.</p><p>5 0.20066544 <a title="167-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Translation_with_Source_Constituency_and_Dependency_Trees.html">187 emnlp-2013-Translation with Source Constituency and Dependency Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Fandong Meng ; Jun Xie ; Linfeng Song ; Yajuan Lu ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel translation model, which simultaneously exploits the constituency and dependency trees on the source side, to combine the advantages of two types of trees. We take head-dependents relations of dependency trees as backbone and incorporate phrasal nodes of constituency trees as the source side of our translation rules, and the target side as strings. Our rules hold the property of long distance reorderings and the compatibility with phrases. Large-scale experimental results show that our model achieves significantly improvements over the constituency-to-string (+2.45 BLEU on average) and dependencyto-string (+0.91 BLEU on average) models, which only employ single type of trees, and significantly outperforms the state-of-theart hierarchical phrase-based model (+1.12 BLEU on average), on three Chinese-English NIST test sets.</p><p>6 0.17516898 <a title="167-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Noise-Aware_Character_Alignment_for_Bootstrapping_Statistical_Machine_Transliteration_from_Bilingual_Corpora.html">139 emnlp-2013-Noise-Aware Character Alignment for Bootstrapping Statistical Machine Transliteration from Bilingual Corpora</a></p>

<p>Author: Kai-Wei Chang ; Wen-tau Yih ; Christopher Meek</p><p>Abstract: We present Multi-Relational Latent Semantic Analysis (MRLSA) which generalizes Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). MRLSA provides an elegant approach to combining multiple relations between words by constructing a 3-way tensor. Similar to LSA, a lowrank approximation of the tensor is derived using a tensor decomposition. Each word in the vocabulary is thus represented by a vector in the latent semantic space and each relation is captured by a latent square matrix. The degree of two words having a specific relation can then be measured through simple linear algebraic operations. We demonstrate that by integrating multiple relations from both homogeneous and heterogeneous information sources, MRLSA achieves state- of-the-art performance on existing benchmark datasets for two relations, antonymy and is-a.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.71613073 <a title="167-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Semi-Markov_Phrase-Based_Monolingual_Alignment.html">167 emnlp-2013-Semi-Markov Phrase-Based Monolingual Alignment</a></p>

<p>Author: Jun-Ping Ng ; Min-Yen Kan ; Ziheng Lin ; Wei Feng ; Bin Chen ; Jian Su ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we classify the temporal relations between pairs of events on an article-wide basis. This is in contrast to much of the existing literature which focuses on just event pairs which are found within the same or adjacent sentences. To achieve this, we leverage on discourse analysis as we believe that it provides more useful semantic information than typical lexico-syntactic features. We propose the use of several discourse analysis frameworks, including 1) Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), 2) PDTB-styled discourse relations, and 3) topical text segmentation. We explain how features derived from these frameworks can be effectively used with support vector machines (SVM) paired with convolution kernels. Experiments show that our proposal is effective in improving on the state-of-the-art significantly by as much as 16% in terms of F1, even if we only adopt less-than-perfect automatic discourse analyzers and parsers. Making use of more accurate discourse analysis can further boost gains to 35%.</p><p>4 0.54326713 <a title="167-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Harvesting_Parallel_News_Streams_to_Generate_Paraphrases_of_Event_Relations.html">93 emnlp-2013-Harvesting Parallel News Streams to Generate Paraphrases of Event Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Congle Zhang ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: The distributional hypothesis, which states that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings, has inspired several Web mining algorithms for paraphrasing semantically equivalent phrases. Unfortunately, these methods have several drawbacks, such as confusing synonyms with antonyms and causes with effects. This paper introduces three Temporal Correspondence Heuristics, that characterize regularities in parallel news streams, and shows how they may be used to generate high precision paraphrases for event relations. We encode the heuristics in a probabilistic graphical model to create the NEWSSPIKE algorithm for mining news streams. We present experiments demonstrating that NEWSSPIKE significantly outperforms several competitive baselines. In order to spur further research, we provide a large annotated corpus of timestamped news arti- cles as well as the paraphrases produced by NEWSSPIKE.</p><p>5 0.53563201 <a title="167-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Personal_Profile_Summarization_with_Social_Networks.html">48 emnlp-2013-Collective Personal Profile Summarization with Social Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>6 0.53430331 <a title="167-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Max-Margin_Synchronous_Grammar_Induction_for_Machine_Translation.html">127 emnlp-2013-Max-Margin Synchronous Grammar Induction for Machine Translation</a></p>

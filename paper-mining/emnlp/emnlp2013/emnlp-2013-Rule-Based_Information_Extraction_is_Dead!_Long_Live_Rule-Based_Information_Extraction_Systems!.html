<p>Author: Andrei Simion ; Michael Collins ; Cliff Stein</p><p>Abstract: The IBM translation models have been hugely influential in statistical machine translation; they are the basis of the alignment models used in modern translation systems. Excluding IBM Model 1, the IBM translation models, and practically all variants proposed in the literature, have relied on the optimization of likelihood functions or similar functions that are non-convex, and hence have multiple local optima. In this paper we introduce a convex relaxation of IBM Model 2, and describe an optimization algorithm for the relaxation based on a subgradient method combined with exponentiated-gradient updates. Our approach gives the same level of alignment accuracy as IBM Model 2.</p><p>3 0.078411549 <a title="161-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Mining_New_Business_Opportunities%3A_Identifying_Trend_related_Products_by_Leveraging_Commercial_Intents_from_Microblogs.html">131 emnlp-2013-Mining New Business Opportunities: Identifying Trend related Products by Leveraging Commercial Intents from Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinpeng Wang ; Wayne Xin Zhao ; Haitian Wei ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Hot trends are likely to bring new business opportunities. For example, “Air Pollution” might lead to a significant increase of the sales of related products, e.g., mouth mask. For ecommerce companies, it is very important to make rapid and correct response to these hot trends in order to improve product sales. In this paper, we take the initiative to study the task of how to identify trend related products. The major novelty of our work is that we automatically learn commercial intents revealed from microblogs. We carefully construct a data collection for this task and present quite a few insightful findings. In order to solve this problem, we further propose a graph based method, which jointly models relevance and associativity. We perform extensive experiments and the results showed that our methods are very effective.</p><p>4 0.069140784 <a title="161-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Unsupervised_Relation_Extraction_with_General_Domain_Knowledge.html">194 emnlp-2013-Unsupervised Relation Extraction with General Domain Knowledge</a></p>
<p>Author: Oier Lopez de Lacalle ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an unsupervised approach to relational information extraction. Our model partitions tuples representing an observed syntactic relationship between two named entities (e.g., “X was born in Y” and “X is from Y”) into clusters corresponding to underlying semantic relation types (e.g., BornIn, Located). Our approach incorporates general domain knowledge which we encode as First Order Logic rules and automatically combine with a topic model developed specifically for the relation extraction task. Evaluation results on the ACE 2007 English Relation Detection and Categorization (RDC) task show that our model outperforms competitive unsupervised approaches by a wide margin and is able to produce clusters shaped by both the data and the rules.</p><p>5 0.061327603 <a title="161-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Open_Domain_Targeted_Sentiment.html">143 emnlp-2013-Open Domain Targeted Sentiment</a></p>
<p>Author: Margaret Mitchell ; Jacqui Aguilar ; Theresa Wilson ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to sentiment analysis for a low resource setting. The intuition behind this work is that sentiment expressed towards an entity, targeted sentiment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment expressed across the entity. This representation allows us to model sentiment detection as a sequence tagging problem, jointly discovering people and organizations along with whether there is sentiment directed towards them. We compare performance in both Spanish and English on microblog data, using only a sentiment lexicon as an external resource. By leveraging linguisticallyinformed features within conditional random fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empirical risk, our best models in Spanish significantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach around 90% accuracy on the combined task of named entity recognition and sentiment prediction. Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.</p><p>6 0.05994409 <a title="161-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Towards_Situated_Dialogue%3A_Revisiting_Referring_Expression_Generation.html">185 emnlp-2013-Towards Situated Dialogue: Revisiting Referring Expression Generation</a></p>

<p>Author: Valentin I. Spitkovsky ; Hiyan Alshawi ; Daniel Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: Many statistical learning problems in NLP call for local model search methods. But accuracy tends to suffer with current techniques, which often explore either too narrowly or too broadly: hill-climbers can get stuck in local optima, whereas samplers may be inefficient. We propose to arrange individual local optimizers into organized networks. Our building blocks are operators of two types: (i) transform, which suggests new places to search, via non-random restarts from already-found local optima; and (ii) join, which merges candidate solutions to find better optima. Experiments on grammar induction show that pursuing different transforms (e.g., discarding parts of a learned model or ignoring portions of training data) results in improvements. Groups of locally-optimal solutions can be further perturbed jointly, by constructing mixtures. Using these tools, we designed several modular dependency grammar induction networks of increasing complexity. Our complete sys- tem achieves 48.6% accuracy (directed dependency macro-average over all 19 languages in the 2006/7 CoNLL data) more than 5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art. —</p><p>5 0.49878833 <a title="161-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-The_Topology_of_Semantic_Knowledge.html">182 emnlp-2013-The Topology of Semantic Knowledge</a></p>
<p>Author: Jimmy Dubuisson ; Jean-Pierre Eckmann ; Christian Scheible ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: Studies of the graph of dictionary definitions (DD) (Picard et al., 2009; Levary et al., 2012) have revealed strong semantic coherence of local topological structures. The techniques used in these papers are simple and the main results are found by understanding the structure of cycles in the directed graph (where words point to definitions). Based on our earlier work (Levary et al., 2012), we study a different class of word definitions, namely those of the Free Association (FA) dataset (Nelson et al., 2004). These are responses by subjects to a cue word, which are then summarized by a directed, free association graph. We find that the structure of this network is quite different from both the Wordnet and the dictionary networks. This difference can be explained by the very nature of free association as compared to the more “logical” construction of dictionaries. It thus sheds some (quantitative) light on the psychology of free association. In NLP, semantic groups or clusters are interesting for various applications such as word sense disambiguation. The FA graph is tighter than the DD graph, because of the large number of triangles. This also makes drift of meaning quite measurable so that FA graphs provide a quantitative measure of the semantic coherence of small groups of words.</p><p>6 0.47091201 <a title="161-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Predicting_the_Resolution_of_Referring_Expressions_from_User_Behavior.html">153 emnlp-2013-Predicting the Resolution of Referring Expressions from User Behavior</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>3 0.4721576 <a title="161-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-What_is_Hidden_among_Translation_Rules.html">201 emnlp-2013-What is Hidden among Translation Rules</a></p>
<p>Author: Libin Shen ; Bowen Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Most of the machine translation systems rely on a large set of translation rules. These rules are treated as discrete and independent events. In this short paper, we propose a novel method to model rules as observed generation output of a compact hidden model, which leads to better generalization capability. We present a preliminary generative model to test this idea. Experimental results show about one point improvement on TER-BLEU over a strong baseline in Chinese-to-English translation.</p><p>4 0.47077847 <a title="161-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Dataset_for_Research_on_Short-Text_Conversations.html">4 emnlp-2013-A Dataset for Research on Short-Text Conversations</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Wang ; Zhengdong Lu ; Hang Li ; Enhong Chen</p><p>Abstract: Natural language conversation is widely regarded as a highly difficult problem, which is usually attacked with either rule-based or learning-based models. In this paper we propose a retrieval-based automatic response model for short-text conversation, to exploit the vast amount of short conversation instances available on social media. For this purpose we introduce a dataset of short-text conversation based on the real-world instances from Sina Weibo (a popular Chinese microblog service), which will be soon released to public. This dataset provides rich collection of instances for the research on finding natural and relevant short responses to a given short text, and useful for both training and testing of conversation models. This dataset consists of both naturally formed conversations, manually labeled data, and a large repository of candidate responses. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that the simple retrieval-based conversation model performs reasonably well when combined with the rich instances in our dataset.</p><p>5 0.47052014 <a title="161-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Max-Margin_Synchronous_Grammar_Induction_for_Machine_Translation.html">127 emnlp-2013-Max-Margin Synchronous Grammar Induction for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Traditional synchronous grammar induction estimates parameters by maximizing likelihood, which only has a loose relation to translation quality. Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>6 0.47019339 <a title="161-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Structured_Penalties_for_Log-Linear_Language_Models.html">176 emnlp-2013-Structured Penalties for Log-Linear Language Models</a></p>

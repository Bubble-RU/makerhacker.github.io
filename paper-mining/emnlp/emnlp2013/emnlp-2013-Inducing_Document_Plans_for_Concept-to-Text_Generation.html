<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Traditional synchronous grammar induction estimates parameters by maximizing likelihood, which only has a loose relation to translation quality. Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>4 0.099165328 <a title="106-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Single-Document_Summarization_as_a_Tree_Knapsack_Problem.html">174 emnlp-2013-Single-Document Summarization as a Tree Knapsack Problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Tsutomu Hirao ; Yasuhisa Yoshida ; Masaaki Nishino ; Norihito Yasuda ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies on extractive text summarization formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem such as a Knapsack Problem, a Maximum Coverage Problem or a Budgeted Median Problem. These methods successfully improved summarization quality, but they did not consider the rhetorical relations between the textual units of a source document. Thus, summaries generated by these methods may lack logical coherence. This paper proposes a single document summarization method based on the trimming of a discourse tree. This is a two-fold process. First, we propose rules for transforming a rhetorical structure theorybased discourse tree into a dependency-based discourse tree, which allows us to take a tree- . trimming approach to summarization. Second, we formulate the problem of trimming a dependency-based discourse tree as a Tree Knapsack Problem, then solve it with integer linear programming (ILP). Evaluation results showed that our method improved ROUGE scores.</p><p>5 0.087038815 <a title="106-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Adaptor_Grammars_for_Learning_Non-Concatenative_Morphology.html">19 emnlp-2013-Adaptor Grammars for Learning Non-Concatenative Morphology</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan A. Botha ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: This paper contributes an approach for expressing non-concatenative morphological phenomena, such as stem derivation in Semitic languages, in terms of a mildly context-sensitive grammar formalism. This offers a convenient level of modelling abstraction while remaining computationally tractable. The nonparametric Bayesian framework of adaptor grammars is extended to this richer grammar formalism to propose a probabilistic model that can learn word segmentation and morpheme lexicons, including ones with discontiguous strings as elements, from unannotated data. Our experiments on Hebrew and three variants of Arabic data find that the additional expressiveness to capture roots and templates as atomic units improves the quality of concatenative segmentation and stem identification. We obtain 74% accuracy in identifying triliteral Hebrew roots, while performing morphological segmentation with an F1-score of 78. 1.</p><p>6 0.080234021 <a title="106-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Semi-Markov_Phrase-Based_Monolingual_Alignment.html">167 emnlp-2013-Semi-Markov Phrase-Based Monolingual Alignment</a></p>

<p>Author: Steven Bethard</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to time normalization (e.g. the day before yesterday⇒20 13-04- 12) based on a synchronous contex⇒t free grammar. Synchronous rules map the source language to formally defined operators for manipulating times (FINDENCLOSED, STARTATENDOF, etc.). Time expressions are then parsed using an extended CYK+ algorithm, and converted to a normalized form by applying the operators recursively. For evaluation, a small set of synchronous rules for English time expressions were developed. Our model outperforms HeidelTime, the best time normalization system in TempEval 2013, on four different time normalization corpora.</p><p>4 0.57579005 <a title="106-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Breaking_Out_of_Local_Optima_with_Count_Transforms_and_Model_Recombination%3A_A_Study_in_Grammar_Induction.html">40 emnlp-2013-Breaking Out of Local Optima with Count Transforms and Model Recombination: A Study in Grammar Induction</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin I. Spitkovsky ; Hiyan Alshawi ; Daniel Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: Many statistical learning problems in NLP call for local model search methods. But accuracy tends to suffer with current techniques, which often explore either too narrowly or too broadly: hill-climbers can get stuck in local optima, whereas samplers may be inefficient. We propose to arrange individual local optimizers into organized networks. Our building blocks are operators of two types: (i) transform, which suggests new places to search, via non-random restarts from already-found local optima; and (ii) join, which merges candidate solutions to find better optima. Experiments on grammar induction show that pursuing different transforms (e.g., discarding parts of a learned model or ignoring portions of training data) results in improvements. Groups of locally-optimal solutions can be further perturbed jointly, by constructing mixtures. Using these tools, we designed several modular dependency grammar induction networks of increasing complexity. Our complete sys- tem achieves 48.6% accuracy (directed dependency macro-average over all 19 languages in the 2006/7 CoNLL data) more than 5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art. —</p><p>5 0.53882086 <a title="106-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Discourse_Analysis_for_Article-Wide_Temporal_Classification.html">76 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Discourse Analysis for Article-Wide Temporal Classification</a></p>

We develop two approaches: the first one is inspired from Rhetorical Structure Theory and represents the document as a tree of discourse relations between database records; the second one requires little linguistic sophistication and uses tree structures to represent global patterns of database record sequences within a document. Experimental evaluation on two domains yields considerable improvements over the state of the art for both approaches.</p><p>3 0.6213128 <a title="106-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Autoencoders_for_ITG-Based_Translation.html">157 emnlp-2013-Recursive Autoencoders for ITG-Based Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Li ; Yang Liu ; Maosong Sun</p><p>Abstract: While inversion transduction grammar (ITG) is well suited for modeling ordering shifts between languages, how to make applying the two reordering rules (i.e., straight and inverted) dependent on actual blocks being merged remains a challenge. Unlike previous work that only uses boundary words, we propose to use recursive autoencoders to make full use of the entire merging blocks alternatively. The recursive autoencoders are capable of generating vector space representations for variable-sized phrases, which enable predicting orders to exploit syntactic and semantic information from a neural language modeling’s perspective. Experiments on the NIST 2008 dataset show that our system significantly improves over the MaxEnt classifier by 1.07 BLEU points.</p><p>4 0.62052095 <a title="106-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Scaling_Semantic_Parsers_with_On-the-Fly_Ontology_Matching.html">164 emnlp-2013-Scaling Semantic Parsers with On-the-Fly Ontology Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Eunsol Choi ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We consider the challenge of learning semantic parsers that scale to large, open-domain problems, such as question answering with Freebase. In such settings, the sentences cover a wide variety of topics and include many phrases whose meaning is difficult to represent in a fixed target ontology. For example, even simple phrases such as ‘daughter’ and ‘number of people living in’ cannot be directly represented in Freebase, whose ontology instead encodes facts about gender, parenthood, and population. In this paper, we introduce a new semantic parsing approach that learns to resolve such ontological mismatches. The parser is learned from question-answer pairs, uses a probabilistic CCG to build linguistically motivated logicalform meaning representations, and includes an ontology matching model that adapts the output logical forms for each target ontology. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark semantic parsing datasets, including a nine point accuracy improvement on a recent Freebase QA corpus.</p><p>5 0.61694306 <a title="106-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Multimodal_LDA_Model_integrating_Textual%2C_Cognitive_and_Visual_Modalities.html">11 emnlp-2013-A Multimodal LDA Model integrating Textual, Cognitive and Visual Modalities</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Roller ; Sabine Schulte im Walde</p><p>Abstract: Recent investigations into grounded models of language have shown that holistic views of language and perception can provide higher performance than independent views. In this work, we improve a two-dimensional multimodal version of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Andrews et al., 2009) in various ways. (1) We outperform text-only models in two different evaluations, and demonstrate that low-level visual features are directly compatible with the existing model. (2) We present a novel way to integrate visual features into the LDA model using unsupervised clusters of images. The clusters are directly interpretable and improve on our evaluation tasks. (3) We provide two novel ways to extend the bimodal mod- els to support three or more modalities. We find that the three-, four-, and five-dimensional models significantly outperform models using only one or two modalities, and that nontextual modalities each provide separate, disjoint knowledge that cannot be forced into a shared, latent structure.</p><p>6 0.61656523 <a title="106-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Semantic_Parsing_on_Freebase_from_Question-Answer_Pairs.html">166 emnlp-2013-Semantic Parsing on Freebase from Question-Answer Pairs</a></p>

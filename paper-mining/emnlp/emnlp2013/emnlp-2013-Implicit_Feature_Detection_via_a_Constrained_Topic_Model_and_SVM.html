<p>Author: Gary Patterson ; Andrew Kehler</p><p>Abstract: We present a classification model that predicts the presence or omission of a lexical connective between two clauses, based upon linguistic features of the clauses and the type of discourse relation holding between them. The model is trained on a set of high frequency relations extracted from the Penn Discourse Treebank and achieves an accuracy of 86.6%. Analysis of the results reveals that the most informative features relate to the discourse dependencies between sequences of coherence relations in the text. We also present results of an experiment that provides insight into the nature and difficulty of the task.</p><p>3 0.13122885 <a title="99-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Dependency_Language_Models_for_Sentence_Completion.html">58 emnlp-2013-Dependency Language Models for Sentence Completion</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Gubbins ; Andreas Vlachos</p><p>Abstract: Sentence completion is a challenging semantic modeling task in which models must choose the most appropriate word from a given set to complete a sentence. Although a variety of language models have been applied to this task in previous work, none of the existing approaches incorporate syntactic information. In this paper we propose to tackle this task using a pair of simple language models in which the probability of a sentence is estimated as the probability of the lexicalisation of a given syntactic dependency tree. We apply our approach to the Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge and show that it improves on n-gram language models by 8.7 percentage points, achieving the highest accuracy reported to date apart from neural language models that are more complex and ex- pensive to train.</p><p>4 0.12280963 <a title="99-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Domain_Knowledge_in_Aspect_Extraction.html">77 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Aspect Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiyuan Chen ; Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu ; Meichun Hsu ; Malu Castellanos ; Riddhiman Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical models have been used for the task. However, such models without any domain knowledge often produce aspects that are not interpretable in applications. To tackle the issue, some knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which allow the user to input some prior domain knowledge to generate coherent aspects. However, existing knowledge-based topic models have several major shortcomings, e.g., little work has been done to incorporate the cannot-link type of knowledge or to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an Extended generalized PÃ³lya urn (E-GPU) model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that MCLDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models markedly.</p><p>5 0.12203435 <a title="99-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Opinion_Target_Extraction_in_Chinese_Microblogs.html">47 emnlp-2013-Collective Opinion Target Extraction in Chinese Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinjie Zhou ; Xiaojun Wan ; Jianguo Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Microblog messages pose severe challenges for current sentiment analysis techniques due to some inherent characteristics such as the length limit and informal writing style. In this paper, we study the problem of extracting opinion targets of Chinese microblog messages. Such fine-grained word-level task has not been well investigated in microblogs yet. We propose an unsupervised label propagation algorithm to address the problem. The opinion targets of all messages in a topic are collectively extracted based on the assumption that similar messages may focus on similar opinion targets. Topics in microblogs are identified by hashtags or using clustering algorithms. Experimental results on Chinese microblogs show the effectiveness of our framework and algorithms.</p><p>6 0.10432944 <a title="99-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Appropriately_Incorporating_Statistical_Significance_in_PMI.html">25 emnlp-2013-Appropriately Incorporating Statistical Significance in PMI</a></p>

<p>Author: Om P. Damani ; Shweta Ghonge</p><p>Abstract: Two recent measures incorporate the notion of statistical significance in basic PMI formulation. In some tasks, we find that the new measures perform worse than the PMI. Our analysis shows that while the basic ideas in incorporating statistical significance in PMI are reasonable, they have been applied slightly inappropriately. By fixing this, we get new measures that improve performance over not just PMI but on other popular co-occurrence measures as well. In fact, the revised measures perform reasonably well compared with more resource intensive non co-occurrence based methods also.</p><p>4 0.48920286 <a title="99-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Dependency_Language_Models_for_Sentence_Completion.html">58 emnlp-2013-Dependency Language Models for Sentence Completion</a></p>

<p>Author: Lifu Huang ; Lian'en Huang</p><p>Abstract: Recently, much research focuses on event storyline generation, which aims to produce a concise, global and temporal event summary from a collection of articles. Generally, each event contains multiple sub-events and the storyline should be composed by the component summaries of all the sub-events. However, different sub-events have different part-whole relationship with the major event, which is important to correspond to usersâ interests but seldom considered in previous work. To distinguish different types of sub-events, we propose a mixture-event-aspect model which models different sub-events into local and global aspects. Combining these local/global aspects with summarization requirements together, we utilize an optimization method to generate the component summaries along the timeline. We develop experimental systems on 6 distinctively different datasets. Evaluation and comparison results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.67613274 <a title="99-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Implicit_Feature_Detection_via_a_Constrained_Topic_Model_and_SVM.html">99 emnlp-2013-Implicit Feature Detection via a Constrained Topic Model and SVM</a></p>

<p>Author: Aju Thalappillil Scaria ; Jonathan Berant ; Mengqiu Wang ; Peter Clark ; Justin Lewis ; Brittany Harding ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Biological processes are complex phenomena involving a series of events that are related to one another through various relationships. Systems that can understand and reason over biological processes would dramatically improve the performance of semantic applications involving inference such as question answering (QA) â specifically âHow? â and âWhy? â questions. In this paper, we present the task of process extraction, in which events within a process and the relations between the events are automatically extracted from text. We represent processes by graphs whose edges describe a set oftemporal, causal and co-reference event-event relations, and characterize the structural properties of these graphs (e.g., the graphs are connected). Then, we present a method for extracting relations between the events, which exploits these structural properties by performing joint in- ference over the set of extracted relations. On a novel dataset containing 148 descriptions of biological processes (released with this paper), we show significant improvement comparing to baselines that disregard process structure.</p><p>4 0.51025778 <a title="99-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Studying_the_Recursive_Behaviour_of_Adjectival_Modification_with_Compositional_Distributional_Semantics.html">177 emnlp-2013-Studying the Recursive Behaviour of Adjectival Modification with Compositional Distributional Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Eva Maria Vecchi ; Roberto Zamparelli ; Marco Baroni</p><p>Abstract: In this study, we use compositional distributional semantic methods to investigate restrictions in adjective ordering. Specifically, we focus on properties distinguishing AdjectiveAdjective-Noun phrases in which there is flexibility in the adjective ordering from those bound to a rigid order. We explore a number of measures extracted from the distributional representation of AAN phrases which may indicate a word order restriction. We find that we are able to distinguish the relevant classes and the correct order based primarily on the degree of modification of the adjectives. Our results offer fresh insight into the semantic properties that determine adjective ordering, building a bridge between syntax and distributional semantics.</p><p>5 0.50873744 <a title="99-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Deep_Models_for_Semantic_Compositionality_Over_a_Sentiment_Treebank.html">158 emnlp-2013-Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Alex Perelygin ; Jean Wu ; Jason Chuang ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Semantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning of longer phrases in a principled way. Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.</p><p>6 0.50793767 <a title="99-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Summarizing_Complex_Events%3A_a_Cross-Modal_Solution_of_Storylines_Extraction_and_Reconstruction.html">179 emnlp-2013-Summarizing Complex Events: a Cross-Modal Solution of Storylines Extraction and Reconstruction</a></p>

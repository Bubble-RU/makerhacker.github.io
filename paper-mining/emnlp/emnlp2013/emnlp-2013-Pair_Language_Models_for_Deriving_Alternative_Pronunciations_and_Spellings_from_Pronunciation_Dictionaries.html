</p><p>7 Pronunciation dictionaries provide natural parallel corpora, with strings of characters paired to strings of phones. [sent-20, score-0.299]
</p><p>8 Further, other algorithms using such dictionaries also use translation phrase tables, but not for translation tasks. [sent-24, score-0.164]
</p><p>9 For example, data-driven paraphrasing methods (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) use translation phrase-tables as a “pivot” to learn sets of phrases which translated to the same target phrase. [sent-25, score-0.095]
</p><p>10 In a similar manner, with a pronunciation dictionary instead of a phrsetable, pivoting can be used to learn alternative pronunciations (Karanasou and Lamel, 2010), i. [sent-26, score-1.02]

</p><p>13 In this study, we explore dictionary-derived models to find either alternative pronunciations or alternative spellings, using either direct (p2p or g2g) or round-trip algorithms (p2g2p or g2p2g). [sent-32, score-0.859]
</p><p>14 Our main interest is to evaluate Karanasou and Lamel (2010) methods shown to be useful for deriving alternative pronunciations for deriving alternative spellings, and thus to determine the relative difficulty of these two tasks. [sent-34, score-0.869]
</p><p>15 We also examine when, if ever, round-trip processing yields benefits over direct transduction. [sent-35, score-0.127]
</p><p>16 Our results indicate that real alternative pronunciations are substantially easier to find than real alternative spellings, partic–  –  Proce Sdeiantgtlse o,f W thaesh 2i0n1gt3o nC,o UnSfeAre,n 1c8e- o2n1 E Omctpoibriecra 2l0 M13et. [sent-36, score-0.789]

</p><p>18 Second, round trip translation yields no gain (and some loss) over direct transduction for finding alternative pronunciations, yet yields some modest gains for finding alternative spellings. [sent-39, score-0.788]
</p><p>19 The primary contribution of this work is to introduce a competitive method of building and using pair language model WFSTs for generating alternative spellings and pronunciations which reflect real-world variability. [sent-42, score-1.064]
</p><p>20 Similar approaches apply to automatic spelling correction, where Toutanova and Moore (2002) extended the noisy channel spelling correction method of Brill and Moore (2000), by modeling pronunciation alternations to infer from  misspellings to correct spellings. [sent-49, score-0.823]
</p><p>21 Similarly, Li and Liu (2012) extended the character-based translation approach to text normalization of Pennell and Liu (201 1), by adding an additional round-trip translation to-and-from pronunciations. [sent-50, score-0.198]
</p><p>22 Karanasou and Lamel (2010) used Moses to generate alternative pronunciations from an English dictionary, using both direct and round-trip methods. [sent-51, score-0.691]
</p><p>23 They validated their systems on a set of words with multiple pronunciations, measuring the degree to which alternative pronunciations are generated from one of the given pronunciations. [sent-52, score-0.621]
</p><p>24 Our task and method of evaluation is similar to theirs, though we also look at alternative spellings. [sent-53, score-0.168]
</p><p>25 3  Methods  To generate alternative spellings and pronunciations, we built phrase-based translation and finite-state 1585 transduction models from a parallel corpus. [sent-54, score-0.794]
</p><p>26 , not direct grapheme-to-grapheme we included conditions with and without vowel stress. [sent-57, score-0.169]
</p><p>27 , sets of multiple spellings sharing the same pronunciation, such as “colonel” and “kernel”. [sent-62, score-0.424]
</p><p>28 , sets of multiple pronunciations all spelled the same, such as potato (/potato/ and /p@teto/). [sent-68, score-0.486]
</p><p>29 We found 8,216 such homograph sets, and randomly selected 1000 for testing; the rest we used for training. [sent-69, score-0.127]
</p><p>30 For round-trip models, the parallel corpus is each grapheme string in the lexicon aligned with its phoneme string, if neither the grapheme string nor phoneme string appear in the test set. [sent-73, score-0.959]
</p><p>31 There are four such corpora, corresponding to these options: stress or no stress, and g2p2g or p2g2p. [sent-74, score-0.232]
</p><p>32 For direct grapheme-to-grapheme training sets, non-homophone words are self-aligned; for homophones, from each homophone set, each possible  pair of spellings are aligned. [sent-76, score-0.573]
</p><p>33 For example, for a pronunciation with four spellings—a, b, c, and d— there would be six alignments: a:b, a:c, a:d, b:c, b:d, c:d. [sent-77, score-0.351]
</p><p>34 Similarly for direct phoneme-to-phoneme training sets, non-homograph words are self-aligned; words from the training homograph sets are pairwise aligned in all pairings. [sent-78, score-0.23]
</p><p>35 2  Phrase-based translation models  As a baseline system, we used the Moses statistical machine translation package (Koehn et al. [sent-81, score-0.124]
</p><p>36 2 These are trained on the parallel corpus resulting from the homophone or homograph sets detailed in 1http://www. [sent-83, score-0.286]
</p><p>37 For this paper, we did not perform round-trip translation with Moses, rather present it as a baseline for the direct approach. [sent-89, score-0.132]
</p><p>38 A trigram model over these x:y strings would use standard ngram modeling to estimate, for example, P(? [sent-99, score-0.109]
</p><p>39 In the first phase we create new corpora by aligning the elements of the parallel corpora outlined above. [sent-107, score-0.117]
</p><p>40 In the second phase we use these corpora of string alignments to build a pair language model. [sent-108, score-0.127]
</p><p>41 As in Brill and Moore (2000), we allow for certain multi-  symbol strings to be substituted with a single cost, e. [sent-112, score-0.109]
</p><p>42 Other substitutions are not permitted, and delete and insertion have cost 10. [sent-116, score-0.144]
</p><p>43 Without vowel stress, no substitutions other than identity are allowed; with vowel stress, substitution cost is 2. [sent-118, score-0.282]
</p><p>44 Other substitutions are not permitted, and, again, delete and insertion have cost 10. [sent-121, score-0.144]
</p><p>45 1586 We begin with a basic substitution table that allows graphemes and their most likely phonemes to align. [sent-123, score-0.136]
</p><p>46 We then re-estimate the substitution costs based on relative frequency estimation (-logP), and also aggregate sequences of consecutively deleted graphemes so that they collectively map to a single phoneme. [sent-124, score-0.136]
</p><p>47 Grapheme strings that appear sufficiently often with a given phoneme will thus accumulate sufficient probability mass to compete. [sent-129, score-0.328]
</p><p>48 Each alignment produced as described above is a string in a training corpus for creating a pair language model. [sent-130, score-0.126]
</p><p>49 , 2012) to build 5-gram language models from the strings of input:output pairs. [sent-137, score-0.109]
</p><p>50 4 Producing k-best output Each tested input string, spelling or pronunciation, is encoded as a cost-free linear chain WFST and composed with a pair language model transducer described in the previous section. [sent-148, score-0.301]
</p><p>51 For direct models (g2g and p2p), the k-best output from this first transduction is our result, ranked according the probability of each path. [sent-154, score-0.232]
</p><p>52 g2p2g), however, we do a second transduction in the other direction. [sent-157, score-0.132]
</p><p>53 For example, for g2p2g, the first transduction would have transduced from a spelling to a set of candidate pronunciations; the second transduction will transduce from pronunciations to spellings. [sent-158, score-0.936]
</p><p>54 Finally, we score each alternative by combining their scores from both transductions. [sent-162, score-0.168]
</p><p>55 Let ¯ p represent a phoneme string, and ¯g a grapheme string. [sent-163, score-0.366]
</p><p>56 If we perform a transduction from p¯ to g¯, the weights from the transducer provide the (negative log) joint probability P(¯ p, ¯g ). [sent-164, score-0.199]
</p><p>57 By performing a soft-max normalization over the k-best list output, we obtain the (negative log) conditional probability P(¯ g | p¯) . [sent-165, score-0.105]

</p><p>59 Xg¯ 4  Experimental results  For evaluation purposes, we reserved a set of 1000 test homophone sets and 1000 test homograph sets, as described in Section 3. [sent-170, score-0.245]
</p><p>60 From each set, we generate alternatives from the longest set member (ties broken alphabetically) and examine the resulting kbest list for presence of other members of the set. [sent-172, score-0.163]
</p><p>61 Results for generating alternative pronunciations are listed in Table 1; those for generating alternative spellings are in Table 2. [sent-175, score-1.18]
</p><p>62 For alternative spellings, we also present results that combine the outputs of direct, round-trip (no stress) and Moses into a single list using a simple ranked voting scheme (simple Borda count). [sent-176, score-0.199]
</p><p>63 A noteworthy result is the apparent usefulness of stress modeling for predicting pronunciation variation using WFSTs with the direct method; this is 1587  seen in the first two data columns of 1. [sent-177, score-0.653]
</p><p>64 This suggests that stress has an effect on phoneme alteration, something we discuss in more detail in Section 5. [sent-178, score-0.451]
</p><p>65 However, while providing a large gain in the p2p condition, pronunciation modeling gives small or negative effects elsewhere. [sent-179, score-0.351]
</p><p>66 In the round trip methods, the effects of stress are lost: stress has little influence of how a particular phoneme is spelled. [sent-180, score-0.72]
</p><p>67 Thus, graphemes do not retain much stress information, hence any pass through the orthographic domain will shed it. [sent-181, score-0.393]
</p><p>68 Recall is higher for alternative pronunciations than for alternative spellings. [sent-182, score-0.789]
</p><p>69 One reason for this is that spellings in our test set average eight letters, whereas the pronunciations average around five phonemes. [sent-183, score-0.844]
</p><p>70 Furthermore, the average Levenshtein distance between original spellings and their target alternatives, is 2. [sent-184, score-0.391]
</p><p>71 ×  The results also show gains resulting from the roundtrip method when applied to finding alternative spellings, but no such gains when roundtrip methods are applied to alternative pronunciations. [sent-189, score-0.643]
</p><p>72 Suppose, when seeking alternatives for some spelling, we alter grapheme g1 to g2. [sent-190, score-0.215]
</p><p>73 The roundtrip method, however, is less constrained: there must exist some phoneme p1 in the training set such that g1 maps to p1, and p1 maps to g2; thus, the set of possible alternations at testing are {g1 → p1} {p1 → g2}. [sent-192, score-0.399]
</p><p>74 These extra possible mappings may be helpful or harmful, depending on how likely they are compared to the possible mappings they displace. [sent-196, score-0.14]
</p><p>75 Why are they helpful for alternative spellings, but not for al-  ternative pronunciations? [sent-197, score-0.168]
</p><p>76 System combination yields solid gains in finding alternative spellings, demonstrating that these different systems are coming up with diverse options. [sent-201, score-0.26]
</p><p>77 Finally, we note that many of the false positive pronunciations given by the WFST system are plausibly correct although they are not included in the CMU dictionary. [sent-202, score-0.453]
</p><p>78 Meanwhile, the p2p WFST system (with stress modeling) produces /æd@kwIt/. [sent-204, score-0.232]
</p><p>79 This suggests that we can learn from CMU dictionary to predict actual pronunciations that CMU dictionary does not itself list. [sent-205, score-0.549]
</p><p>80 5  Discussion and Summary  The experimental results demonstrated the utility of stress modeling for generating alternative pronunciations, which we suggested was due to the impact of stress on phoneme alternation. [sent-206, score-0.851]
</p><p>81 To examine this more closely, we looked at each phoneme, stress class, (ph, s)—e. [sent-207, score-0.259]
</p><p>82 (/@/, primary)—and determined how likely is an occurrence of (ph, s) to have an alternative phoneme in a homograph set. [sent-209, score-0.514]
</p><p>83 A further analysis of the system output might shed more light on relationships between stress and phoneme choice. [sent-216, score-0.509]
</p><p>84 1588 Why are round-trip methods useful for finding alternative spellings but not for finding alternative pronunciations? [sent-217, score-0.785]
</p><p>85 One possible explanation is that the variety of orthographic alternations is greater than that of pronunciation alternations. [sent-218, score-0.5]
</p><p>86 Thus, the training set for spelling may provide less relative coverage of the alternations in its test set than the training set for pronunciation provides for its test set. [sent-219, score-0.602]
</p><p>87 This is supported by the fact that pronunciation recall exceeds spelling recall. [sent-220, score-0.528]
</p><p>88 The roundtrip method allows for finding mappings not seen in training. [sent-221, score-0.205]
</p><p>89 These extra mappings might be no better for spelling than they are for pronunciation, but for spelling, the mappings they replace in the k-best list are worse, so they yield an improvement. [sent-222, score-0.348]
</p><p>90 For pronunciation, the mappings they replace in the k-best list are better, so they yield a loss. [sent-223, score-0.101]
</p><p>91 Ultimately, we would like to apply these methods to the normalization of social media text, especially to find alternative spellings based on alternative pronunciations. [sent-225, score-0.801]
</p><p>92 To apply such methods to, say, Twitter normalization requires a sizable corpus mapping canonical spellings to non-standard spellings. [sent-226, score-0.465]
</p><p>93 To assess domain portability, we applied a model built from the CMU dictionary to just over 100 alternative spellings observed in a small Twitter collection. [sent-227, score-0.607]
</p><p>94 Using the direct g2g method, we generated alternative spellings from the canonical spelling of each term, and measured the recall of the output, i. [sent-228, score-0.806]
</p><p>95 Recall was extremely low (less than 5%), suggesting that the type of orthographic alterations that are found in dictionary pronunciations are very different from the orthographic variations found on Twitter, and that those differences have a profound effect on our ability to recover alternatives. [sent-231, score-0.639]
</p><p>96 In sum, we have presented a small study of the utility of pronunciation dictionaries for finding spelling and pronunciation alternatives, demonstrating key differences between these tasks. [sent-232, score-0.948]

<p>Author: Chia-ying Lee ; Yu Zhang ; James Glass</p><p>Abstract: The creation of a pronunciation lexicon remains the most inefficient process in developing an Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR). In this paper, we propose an unsupervised alternative requiring no language-specific knowledge to the conventional manual approach for creating pronunciation dictionaries. We present a hierarchical Bayesian model, which jointly discovers the phonetic inventory and the Letter-to-Sound (L2S) mapping rules in a language using only transcribed data. When tested on a corpus of spontaneous queries, the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed joint learning scheme over its sequential counterpart, in which the latent phonetic inventory and L2S mappings are learned separately. Furthermore, the recognizers built with the automatically induced lexicon consistently outperform grapheme-based recognizers and even approach the performance of recognition systems trained using – – conventional supervised procedures.</p><p>4 0.10316474 <a title="150-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Joint_Learning_Model_of_Word_Segmentation%2C_Lexical_Acquisition%2C_and_Phonetic_Variability.html">8 emnlp-2013-A Joint Learning Model of Word Segmentation, Lexical Acquisition, and Phonetic Variability</a></p>
<p>Author: Micha Elsner ; Sharon Goldwater ; Naomi Feldman ; Frank Wood</p><p>Abstract: We present a cognitive model of early lexical acquisition which jointly performs word segmentation and learns an explicit model of phonetic variation. We define the model as a Bayesian noisy channel; we sample segmentations and word forms simultaneously from the posterior, using beam sampling to control the size of the search space. Compared to a pipelined approach in which segmentation is performed first, our model is qualitatively more similar to human learners.

We define the model as a Bayesian noisy channel; we sample segmentations and word forms simultaneously from the posterior, using beam sampling to control the size of the search space. Compared to a pipelined approach in which segmentation is performed first, our model is qualitatively more similar to human learners. On data with vari- able pronunciations, the pipelined approach learns to treat syllables or morphemes as words. In contrast, our joint model, like infant learners, tends to learn multiword collocations.

In this paper, we propose a segmentation criterion combining both lexical cohesion and disruption, enabling a trade-off between the two. We provide the mathematical formulation of the criterion and an efficient graph based decoding algorithm for topic segmentation. Experimental results on standard textual data sets and on a more challenging corpus of automatically transcribed broadcast news shows demonstrate the benefit of such a combination. Gains were observed in all conditions, with segments of either regular or varying length and abrupt or smooth topic shifts. Long segments benefit more than short segments. However the algorithm has proven robust on automatic transcripts with short segments and limited vocabulary reoccurrences.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.78864479 <a title="150-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Pair_Language_Models_for_Deriving_Alternative_Pronunciations_and_Spellings_from_Pronunciation_Dictionaries.html">150 emnlp-2013-Pair Language Models for Deriving Alternative Pronunciations and Spellings from Pronunciation Dictionaries</a></p>

Previous work on machine comprehension (e.g., semantic modeling) has made great strides, but primarily focuses either on limited-domain datasets, or on solving a more restricted goal (e.g., open-domain relation extraction). In contrast, MCTest requires machines to answer multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about fictional stories, directly tackling the high-level goal of open-domain machine comprehension. Reading comprehension can test advanced abilities such as causal reasoning and understanding the world, yet, by being multiple-choice, still provide a clear metric. By being fictional, the answer typically can be found only in the story itself. The stories and questions are also carefully limited to those a young child would understand, reducing the world knowledge that is required for the task. We present the scalable crowd-sourcing methods that allow us to cheaply construct a dataset of 500 stories and 2000 questions. By screening workers (with grammar tests) and stories (with grading), we have ensured that the data is the same quality as another set that we manually edited, but at one tenth the editing cost. By being open-domain, yet carefully restricted, we hope MCTest will serve to encourage research and provide a clear metric for advancement on the machine comprehension of text. 1 Reading Comprehension A major goal for NLP is for machines to be able to understand text as well as people. Several research 193 semantic role labeling, and recognizing textual entailment. Yet these techniques are necessarily evaluated individually, rather than by how much they advance us towards the end goal. On the other hand, the goal of semantic parsing is the machine comprehension of text (MCT), yet its evaluation requires adherence to a specific knowledge representation, and it is currently unclear what the best representation is, for open-domain text. We believe that it is useful to directly tackle the top-level task of MCT. For this, we need a way to measure progress. One common method for evaluating someone’s understanding of text is by giving them a multiple-choice reading comprehension test. This has the advantage that it is objectively gradable (vs. essays) yet may test a range of abilities such as causal or counterfactual reasoning, inference among relations, or just basic understanding of the world in which the passage is set. Therefore, we propose a multiple-choice reading comprehension task as a way to evaluate progress on MCT. We have built a reading comprehension dataset containing 500 fictional stories, with 4 multiple choice questions per story. It was built using methods which can easily scale to at least 5000 stories, since the stories were created, and the curation was done, using crowd sourcing almost entirely, at a total of $4.00 per story. We plan to periodically update the dataset to ensure that methods are not overfitting to the existing data. The dataset is open-domain, yet restricted to concepts and words that a 7 year old is expected to understand. This task is still beyond the capability of today’s computers and algorithms.

The multiple choice task avoids ambiguities (such as when the task is to find a sentence that best matches a question, as in some early reading comprehension tasks: see Section 2), and also avoids the need for additional grading, such as is needed in some TREC tasks. The stories were chosen to be fictional to focus work on finding the answer in the story itself, rather than in knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia; the goal is to build technology that actually understands stories and paragraphs on a deep level (as opposed to using information retrieval methods and the redundancy of the web to find the answers). We chose to use crowd sourcing, as opposed to, for example, contracting teachers or paying for existing standardized tests, for three reasons, namely: (1) scalability, both for the sizes of datasets we can provide, and also for the ease of regularly refreshing the data; (2) for the variety in story-telling that having many different authors brings; and (3) for the free availability that can only result from providing non-copyrighted data. The content is freely available at http://research.microsoft.com/mct, and we plan to use that site to track published results and provide other resources, such as labels of various kinds. 2 Previous Work The research goal of mapping text to meaning representations in order to solve particular tasks has a long history. DARPA introduced the Airline Travel Information System (ATIS) in the early 90’s: there the task was to slot-fill flight-related information by modeling the intent of spoken language (see Tur et al., 2010, for a review). This data continues to be a used in the semantic modeling community (see, for example, Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2009). The Geoquery database contains 880 geographical facts about the US and has played a similar role for written (as opposed to spoken) natural language queries against a database (Zelle and Mooney, 1996) and it also continues to spur research (see for example Goldwasser et al., 2011), as does the similar Jobs database, which provides mappings of 640 sentences to a listing of jobs 194 (Tang and Mooney, 2001). More recently, Zweig and Burges (2012) provided a set of 1040 sentences that comprise an SAT-style multiple choice sentence completion task. The idea of using story-based reading comprehension questions to evaluate methods for machine reading itself goes back over a decade, when Hirschmann et al. (1999) showed that a bag of words approach, together with some heuristic linguistic modeling, could achieve 40% accuracy for the task of picking the sentence that best matches the query for “who / what / when / where / why” questions, on a small reading comprehension dataset from Remedia. This dataset spurred several research efforts, for example using reinforcement learning (Grois and Wilkins, 2005), named entity resolution (Harabagiu et al., 2003) and mapping questions and answers to logical form (Wellner et al., 2006). Work on story understanding itself goes back much further, to 1972, when Charniak proposed using a background model to answer questions about children’s stories. Similarly, the TREC (and TAC) Question Answering tracks (e.g., Voorhees and Tice, 1999) aim to evaluate systems on their ability to answer factual questions such as “Where is the Taj Mahal”. The QA4MRE task also aims to evaluate machine reading systems through question answering (e.g., Clark et al., 2012). Earlier work has also aimed at controlling the scope by limiting the text to children’s stories: Breck et al. (2001) collected 75 stories from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s web site for children, and generated 650 questions for them manually, where each question was answered by a sentence in the text. Leidner et al. (2003) both enriched the CBC4kids data by adding several layers of annotation (such as semantic and POS tags), and measured QA performance as a function of question difficulty. For a further compendium of resources related to the story comprehension task, see Mueller (2010). The task proposed here differs from the above work in several ways. Most importantly, the data collection is scalable: if the dataset proves sufficiently useful to others, it would be straightforward to gather an order of magnitude more. Even the dataset size presented here is an order of magnitude larger than the Remedia or the CBC4kids data and many times larger than QA4MRE. Second, the multiple choice task presents less ambiguity (and is consequently easier to collect data for) than the ly from MC500 train set). task of finding the most appropriate sentence, and may be automatically evaluated. Further, our stories are fictional, which means that the information to answer the question is contained only in the story itself (as opposed to being able to directly leverage knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia). 195 This design was chosen to focus the task on the machine understanding of short passages, rather than the ability to match against an existing knowledge base. In addition, while in the CBC4kids data each answer was a sentence from the story, here we required that approximately half of the questions require at least two sentences from the text to answer; being able to control complexity in this way is a further benefit of using multiple choice answers. Finally, as explained in Section 1, the use of free-form input makes the problem open domain (as opposed to the ATIS, Geoquery and Jobs data), leading to the hope that solutions to the task presented here will be easier to apply to novel, unrelated tasks. 3 Generating the Stories and Questions Our aim was to generate a corpus of fictional story that could be scaled with as little expert input as possible. Thus, we designed the process to be gated by cost, and keeping the costs low was a high priority. Crowd-sourcing seemed particularly appropriate, given the nature of the task, so we opted to use Amazon Mechanical Turk2 (AMT). With over 500,000 workers3, it provides the work sets1 force required to both achieve scalability and, equally importantly, to provide diversity in the stories and types of questions. We restricted our task to AMT workers (workers) residing in the United States. The average worker is 36 years old, more educated than the United States population in general (Paolacci et al., 2010), and the majority of workers are female. 3.1 The Story and Questions Workers were instructed to write a short (150-300 words) fictional story, and to write as if for a child in grade school. The choice of 150-300 was made to keep the task an appropriate size for workers while still allowing for complex stories and questions. The workers were free to write about any topic they desired (as long as it was appropriate for a young child), and so there is a wide range, including vacations, animals, school, cars, eating, gardening, fairy tales, spaceships, and cowboys. 1 We use the term “story set” to denote the fictional story together with its multiple choice questions, hypothetical answers, and correct answer labels. 2 http://www.mturk.com 3 https://requester.mturk.com/tour Workers were also asked to provide four reading comprehension questions pertaining to their story and, for each, four multiple-choice answers. Coming up with incorrect alternatives (distractors) is a difficult task (see, e.g., Agarwal, 2011) but workers were requested to provide “reasonable” incorrect answers that at least include words from the story so that their solution is not trivial. For example, for the question “What is the name of the dog?”, if only one of the four answers occurs in the story, then that answer must be the correct one. Finally, workers were asked to design their questions and answers such that at least two of the four questions required multiple sentences from the story to answer them. That is, for those questions it should not be possible to find the answer in any individual sentence. The motivation for this was to ensure that the task could not be fully solved using lexical techniques, such as word matching, alone. Whilst it is still possible that a sophisticated lexical analysis could completely solve the task, requiring that answers be constructed from at least two different sentences in the story makes this much less likely; our hope is that the solution will instead require some inference and some form of limited reasoning. This hope rests in part upon the observation that standardized reading comprehension tests, whose goal after all is to test comprehension, generally avoid questions that can be answered by reading a single sentence. 3.2 Automatic Validation Besides verifying that the story and all of the questions and answers were provided, we performed the following automatic validation before allowing the worker to complete the task: Limited vocabulary: The lowercase words in the story, questions, and answers were stemmed and checked against a vocabulary list of approximately 8000 words that a 7-year old is likely to know (Kuperman et al., 2012). Any words not on the list were highlighted in red as the worker typed, and the task could not be submitted unless all of the words satisfied this vocabulary criterion. To allow the use of arbitrary proper nouns, capitalized words were not checked against the vocabulary list. Multiple-sentence questions: As described earlier, we required that at least two of the questions need multiple sentences to answer. Workers were simply asked to mark whether a question needs one 196 or multiple sentences and we required that at least two are marked as multiple. 3.3 The Workers Workers were required to reside in the United States and to have completed 100 HITs with an over 95% approval The median worker took 22 minutes to complete the task. We paid workers $2.50 per story set and allowed each to do a maximum of 8 tasks (5 in MC500). We did not experiment with paying less, but this rate amounts to $6.82/hour, which is approximately the rate paid by other writing tasks on AMT at the time, though is also significantly higher than the median wage of $1.38 found in 2010 (Horton and Chilton, 2010). Workers could optionally leave feedback on the task, which was overwhelmingly positive – the most frequent non-stopword in the comments was “fun” and the most frequent phrase was “thank you”. The only negative comments (in <1% of submissions) were when the worker felt that a particular word should have been on the allowed vocabulary list. Given the positive feedback, it may be possible to pay less if we collect more data in the future. We did not enforce story length constraints, but some workers interpreted our suggestion that the story be 150-300 words as a hard rate4. constraint, and some asked to be able to write a longer story. The MCTest corpus contains two sets of stories, named MC160 and MC500, and containing 160 and 500 stories respectively. MC160 was gathered first, then some improvements were made before gathering MC500. We give details on the differences between these two sets below. 3.4 MC160: Manually Curated for Quality In addition to the details described above, MC160 workers were given a target elementary grade school level (1-4) and a sample story matching that grade level5. The intent was to produce a set of stories and questions that varied in difficulty so that research work can progress grade-by-grade if needed. However, we found little difference between grades in the corpus.. After gathering the stories, we manually curated the MC160 corpus by reading each story set and 4 The latter two are the default AMT requirements. 5 From http://www.englishforeveryone.org/. correcting errors. The most common mistakes were grammatical, though occasionally questions and/or answers needed to be fixed. 66% of the stories have at least one correction. We provide both the curated and original corpuses in order to allow research on reading comprehension in the presence of grammar, spelling, and other mistakes. 3.5 MC500: Adding a Grammar Test Though the construction of MC160 was successful, it requires a costly curation process which will not scale to larger data sets (although the curation was useful, both for improving the design of MC500, and for assessing the effectiveness of automated curation techniques). To more fully automate the process, we added two more stages: (1) A grammar test that automatically pre-screens workers for writing ability, and (2) a second Mechanical Turk task whereby new workers take the reading comprehension tests and rate their quality. We will discuss stage (2) in the next section. The grammar test consisted of 20 sentences, half of which had one grammatical error (see Figure 2). The incorrect sentences were written using common errors such as you ’re vs. your, using ‘s to indicate plurality, incorrect use of tense, it’ ’s vs. its, 197 NGoGramram mar TreTsets Q(u134a-.52l3i) tyaAn73ib m0o% aults Table 1. Pre-screening workers using a grammar test improves both quality and diversity of stories. Both differences are significant using the two-tailed t-test (p<0.05 for quality and p<0.01 for animals). less vs. fewer, I me, etc. Workers were required vs. to indicate for each sentence whether it was grammatically correct or not, and had to pass with at least 80% accuracy in order to qualify for the task. The 80% threshold was chosen to trade off worker quality with the rate at which the tasks would be completed; initial experiments using a threshold of 90% indicated that collecting 500 stories would take many weeks instead of days. Note that each worker is allowed to write at most 5 stores, so we required at least 100 workers to pass the qualification test. To validate the use of the qualification test, we gathered 30 stories requiring the test (qual) and 30 stories without. We selected a random set of 20 stories (10 from each), hid their origin, and then graded the overall quality of the story and questions from 1-5, meaning do not attempt to fix, bad but rescuable, has non-minor problems, has only minor problems, and has no problems, respectively. Results are shown in Table 1. The difference is statistically significant (p<0.05, using the twotailed t-test). The qual stories were also more diverse, with fewer of them about animals (the most common topic). Additional Modifications: Based on our experience curating MC160, we also made the following modifications to the task. In order to eliminate trivially-answerable questions, we required that each answer be unique, and that either the correct answer did not appear in the story or, if it did appear, that at least two of the incorrect answers also appeared in the story. This is to prevent questions that are trivially answered by checking which answer appears in the story. The condition on whether the correct answer appears is to allow questions such as “How many candies did Susan eat?”, where the total may never appear in the story, even though the information needed to derive it does. An answer is considered to appear in the story if at least half (rounded down) of its non-stopword terms appear in the story (ignoring word endings). This check is done automatically and must be satisfied before the worker is able to complete the task. Workers could also bypass the check if they felt it was incorrect, by adding a special term to their answer. We were also concerned that the sample story might bias the workers when writing the story set, particularly when designing questions that require multiple sentences to answer. So, we removed the sample story and grade level from the task. Finally, in order to encourage more diversity of stories, we added creativity terms, a set of 15 nouns chosen at random from the allowed vocabulary set. Workers were asked to “please consider” using one or more of the terms in their story, but use of the words was strictly optional. On average, workers used 3.9 of the creativity terms in their stories. 4 Rating the Stories and Questions In this section we discuss the crowd-sourced rating of story sets. We wished to ensure story set quality despite the fact that MC500 was only minimally manually curated (see below). Pre-qualifying workers with a grammar test was one step of this process. The second step was to have additional workers on Mechanical Turk both evaluate each story and take its corresponding test. Each story was evaluated in this way by 10 workers, each of whom provided scores for each of ageappropriateness (yes/maybe/no), grammaticality (few/some/many errors), and story clarity (excellent/reasonable/poor). When answering the four reading comprehension questions, workers could also mark a question as “unclear”. Each story set was rated by 10 workers who were each paid $0. 15 per set. Since we know the purportedly correct answer, we can estimate worker quality by measuring what fraction of questions that worker got right. Workers with less than 80% accuracy (ignoring those questions marked as unclear) were removed from the set. This constituted just 4.1% of the raters and 4.2% of the judgments (see Figure 3). Only one rater appeared to be an intentional spammer, answering 1056 questions with only 29% accuracy. The others primarily judged only one story. Only one worker fell between, answering 336 questions with just 75% accuracy. 198 Figure 3. Just 4.1% of raters had an accuracy below 80% (constituting 4.2% of the judgments). For the remaining workers (those who achieved at least 80% accuracy), we measured median story appropriateness, grammar, and clarity. For each category, stories for which less than half of the ratings were the best possible (e.g., excellent story clarity) were inspected and optionally removed from the data set. This required inspecting 40 (<10%) of the stories, only 2 of which were deemed poor enough to be removed (both of which had over half of the ratings all the way at the bot- tom end of the scale, indicating we could potentially have inspected many fewer stories with the same results). We also inspected questions for which at least 5 workers answered incorrectly, or answered “unclear”. In total, 29 questions (<2%) were inspected. 5 were fixed by changing the question, 8 by changing the answers, 2 by changing both, 6 by changing the story, and 8 were left unmodified. Note that while not fully automated, this process of inspecting stories and repairing questions took one person one day, so is still scalable to at least an order of magnitude more stories. 5 Dataset Analysis In Table 2, we present results demonstrating the value of the grammar test and curation process. As expected, manually curating MC160 resulted in increased grammar quality and percent of questions answered correctly by raters. The goal of MC500 was to find a more scalable method to achieve the same quality as the curated MC160. As Table 2 shows, the grammar test improved story grammar quality from 1.70 to 1.77 (both uncurated). The rating and one-day curation process in- TS51a06bet0l cu2r.ateAdvra1 Ag.9e8241aAgpe1 Cp.67la13r57oiptyrae1 Gn.7er8a90s74mǂ, satroy9C 567oc.lr397a eritcy, grammar quality (0-2, with 2 being best), and percent of questions answered correctly by raters, for the original and curated versions of the data.

Curation also improved the percent of questions answered correctly for both MC160 and MC500, but, unlike with grammar, there is no significant difference between the two curated sets. Indeed, the only statis- tically significant difference between the two is in grammar. So, the MC500 grammar test and curation process is a very scalable method for collecting stories of nearly the quality of the costly manual curation of MC160. We also computed correlations between these measures of quality and various factors such as story length and time spent writing the story. On MC500, there is a mild correlation between a worker’s grammar test score and the judged grammar quality of that worker’s story (correlation of 0.24). Interestingly, this relation disappeared once MC500 was curated, likely due to repairing the stories with the worst grammar. On MC160, there is a mild correlation between the clarity and the number of words in the question and answer (0.20 and 0.18). All other correlations were below 0. 15. These factors could be integrated into an estimate for age-appropriateness, clarity, and grammar, potentially reducing the need for raters. Table 3 provides statistics on each corpus. MC160 and MC500 are similar in average number of words per story, question, and answer, as well as the median writing time.

All differences between SW and SW+D are significant (p<0.01, tested as above). We randomly divided MC160 and MC500 into train, development, and test sets of 70, 30, and 60 stories and 300, 50, and 150 stories, respectively. 6 Baseline System and Results We wrote two baseline systems, both using only simple lexical features. The first system used a sliding window, matching a bag of words constructed from the question and hypothesized answer to the text. Since this ignored long range dependencies, we added a second, word-distance based algorithm. The distance-based score was simply subtracted from the window-based score to arrive at the final score (we tried scaling the distance score before subtraction but this did not improve results on the MC160 train set). The algorithms are summarized in Figure 4. A coin flip is used to break ties. The use of inverse word counts was inspired by TF-IDF. Results for MC160 and MC500 are shown in Table 4 and Table 5. The MC160 train and development sets were used for tuning. The baseline algorithm was authored without seeing any portion of MC500, so both the MC160 test set and all of 200 BRCoaTsmEelbin e d(SW+D)65 M967C. 76219506ǂ 0Test5 6M603C. 685 7320ǂ 0Test Table 6. Percent correct for MC160 and MC500 test sets. The ǂ indicates statistical significance vs. baseline (p<0.01 using the two-tailed paired t-test). MC160 combined vs. baseline has p-value 0.063. MC500 were used for testing (although we nevertheless report results on the train/test split). Note that adding the distance based algorithm improved accuracy by approximately 10% absolute on MC160 and approximately 6% on MC500. Overall, error rates on MC500 are higher than on MC160, which agrees with human performance (see Table 2), suggesting that MC500’s questions are more difficult. 7 Recognizing Textual Entailment Results We also tried using a “recognizing textual entailment” (RTE) system to answer MCTest questions. The goal of RTE (Dagan et al., 2005) is to determine whether a given statement can be inferred from a particular text. We can cast MCTest as an RTE task by converting each question-answer pair into a statement, and then selecting the answer whose statement has the highest likelihood of being entailed by the story. For example, in the sample story given in Figure 1, the second question can be converted into four statements (one for each answer), and the RTE system should select the statement “James pulled pudding off of the shelves in the grocery store” as the most likely one. For converting question-answer pairs to statements, we used the rules employed in a web-based question answering system (Cucerzan and Agichtein, 2005). For RTE, we used BIUTEE (Stern and Dagan, 2011), which performs better than the median system in the past four RTE competitions. We ran BIUTEE both in its default configuration, as well as with its optional additional data sources (FrameNet, ReVerb, DIRT, and others as found on the BIUTEE home page). The default configuration performed better so we present its results here. The results in Table 6 show that the RTE method performed worse than the baseline. We also combined the baseline and RTE system by training BIUTEE on the train set and using the development set to optimize a linear combination of BIUTEE with the baseline; the combined system outperforms either component system on MC500. It is possible that with some tuning, an RTE system will outperform our baseline system. Nevertheless, these RTE results, and the performance of the baseline system, both suggest that the reading comprehension task described here will not be trivially solved by off-the-shelf techniques. 8 Making Data and Results an Ongoing Resource Our goal in constructing this data is to encourage research and innovation in the machine comprehension of text. Thus, we have made both MC160 and MC500 freely available for download at http://research.microsoft.com/mct. To our knowledge, these are the largest copyright-free reading comprehension data sets publicly available. To further encourage research on these data, we will be continually updating the webpage with the bestknown published results to date, along with pointers to those publications. One of the difficulties in making progress on a particular task is implementing previous work in order to apply improvements to it. To mitigate this difficulty, we are encouraging researchers who use the data to (optionally) provide per-answer scores from their system. Doing so has three benefits: (a) a new system can be measured in the context of the errors made by the previous systems, allowing each research effort to incrementally add useful functionality without needing to also re-implement the current state-of-the-art; (b) it allows system performance to be measured using paired statistical testing, which will substantially increase the ability to determine whether small improvements are significant; and (c) it enables researchers to perform error analysis on any of the existing systems, simplifying the process of identifying and tackling common sources of error. We will also periodically ensemble the known systems using standard machine learning techniques and make those results available as well (unless the existing state-of-theart already does such ensembling). The released data contains the stories and questions, as well as the results from workers who rated 201 the stories and took the tests. The latter may be used, for example, to measure machine performance vs. human performance on a per-question basis (i.e., does your algorithm make similar mistakes to humans?), or vs. the judged clarity of each story. The ratings, as well as whether a question needs multiple sentences to answer, should typically only be used in evaluation, since such information is not generally available for most text. We will also provide an anonymized author id for each story, which could allow additional research such as using other works by the same author when understanding a story, or research on authorship attribution (e.g., Stamatatos, 2009). 9 Future Work We plan to use this dataset to evaluate approaches for machine comprehension, but are making it available now so that others may do the same. If MCTest is used we will collect more story sets and will continue to refine the collection process. One interesting research direction is ensuring that the questions are difficult enough to challenge state-ofthe-art techniques as they develop. One idea for this is to apply existing techniques automatically during story set creation to see whether a question is too easily answered by a machine. By requiring authors to create difficult questions, each data set will be made more and more difficult (but still answerable by humans) as the state-of-the-art methods advance. We will also experiment with timing the raters as they answer questions to see if we can find those that are too easy for people to answer. Removing such questions may increase the difficulty for machines as well. Additionally, any divergence between how easily a person answers a question vs. how easily a machine does may point toward new techniques for improving machine comprehension; we plan to conduct research in this direction as well as make any such data available for others. 10 Conclusion We present the MCTest dataset in the hope that it will help spur research into the machine comprehension of text. The metric (the accuracy on the question sets) is clearly defined, and on that metric, lexical baseline algorithms only attain approximately 58% correct on test data (the MC500 set) as opposed to the 100% correct that the majority of crowd-sourced judges attain. A key component of MCTest is the scalable design: we have shown that data whose quality approaches that of expertly cu- rated data can be generated using crowd sourcing coupled with expert correction of worker-identified errors. Should MCTest prove useful to the community, we will continue to gather data, both to increase the corpus size, and to keep the test sets fresh. The data is available at http://research.microsoft.com/mct and any submitted results will be posted there too. Because submissions will be requested to include the score for each test item, researchers will easily be able to compare their systems with those of others, and investigation of ensembles comprised of components from several different teams will be straightforward. MCTest also contains supplementary material that researchers may find useful, such as worker accuracies on a grammar test and crowd-sourced measures of the quality of their stories.

<p>Author: Rui Fang ; Changsong Liu ; Lanbo She ; Joyce Y. Chai</p><p>Abstract: In situated dialogue, humans and agents have mismatched capabilities of perceiving the shared environment. Their representations of the shared world are misaligned. Thus referring expression generation (REG) will need to take this discrepancy into consideration. To address this issue, we developed a hypergraph-based approach to account for group-based spatial relations and uncertainties in perceiving the environment. Our empirical results have shown that this approach outperforms a previous graph-based approach with an absolute gain of 9%. However, while these graph-based approaches perform effectively when the agent has perfect knowledge or perception of the environment (e.g., 84%), they perform rather poorly when the agent has imperfect perception of the environment (e.g., 45%). This big performance gap calls for new solutions to REG that can mediate a shared perceptual basis in situated dialogue.</p><p>3 0.081780873 <a title="153-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Distributions_over_Logical_Forms_for_Referring_Expression_Generation.html">119 emnlp-2013-Learning Distributions over Logical Forms for Referring Expression Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas FitzGerald ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to referring expression generation, casting it as a density estimation problem where the goal is to learn distributions over logical expressions identifying sets of objects in the world. Despite an extremely large space of possible expressions, we demonstrate effective learning of a globally normalized log-linear distribution. This learning is enabled by a new, multi-stage approximate inference technique that uses a pruning model to construct only the most likely logical forms. We train and evaluate the approach on a new corpus of references to sets of visual objects. Experiments show the approach is able to learn accurate models, which generate over 87% of the expressions people used. Additionally, on the previously studied special case of single object reference, we show a 35% relative error reduction over previous state of the art.</p><p>4 0.081097119 <a title="153-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Generative_Joint%2C_Additive%2C_Sequential_Model_of_Topics_and_Speech_Acts_in_Patient-Doctor_Communication.html">6 emnlp-2013-A Generative Joint, Additive, Sequential Model of Topics and Speech Acts in Patient-Doctor Communication</a></p>

<p>Author: Dieu-Thu Le ; Jasper Uijlings ; Raffaella Bernardi</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning language models from large text corpora has been widely studied within the computational linguistic community. However, little is known about the performance of these language models when applied to the computer vision domain. In this work, we compare representative models: a window-based model, a topic model, a distributional memory and a commonsense knowledge database, ConceptNet, in two visual recognition scenarios: human action recognition and object prediction. We examine whether the knowledge extracted from texts through these models are compatible to the knowledge represented in images. We determine the usefulness of different language models in aiding the two visual recognition tasks. The study shows that the language models built from general text corpora can be used instead of expensive annotated images and even outperform the image model when testing on a big general dataset.</p><p>6 0.075297549 <a title="153-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Using_Paraphrases_and_Lexical_Semantics_to_Improve_the_Accuracy_and_the_Robustness_of_Supervised_Models_in_Situated_Dialogue_Systems.html">197 emnlp-2013-Using Paraphrases and Lexical Semantics to Improve the Accuracy and the Robustness of Supervised Models in Situated Dialogue Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Anais Cadilhac ; Nicholas Asher ; Farah Benamara ; Alex Lascarides</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a method that predicts which trades players execute during a winlose game. Our method uses data collected from chat negotiations of the game The Settlers of Catan and exploits the conversation to construct dynamically a partial model of each player’s preferences. This in turn yields equilibrium trading moves via principles from game theory. We compare our method against four baselines and show that tracking how preferences evolve through the dialogue and reasoning about equilibrium moves are both crucial to success.</p><p>3 0.68291116 <a title="153-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Towards_Situated_Dialogue%3A_Revisiting_Referring_Expression_Generation.html">185 emnlp-2013-Towards Situated Dialogue: Revisiting Referring Expression Generation</a></p>

The model is trained on a set of high frequency relations extracted from the Penn Discourse Treebank and achieves an accuracy of 86.6%. Analysis of the results reveals that the most informative features relate to the discourse dependencies between sequences of coherence relations in the text.

<p>Author: Anders Sgaard ; Hector Martinez ; Jakob Elming ; Anders Johannsen</p><p>Abstract: Often the bottleneck in document classification is finding good representations that zoom in on the most important aspects of the documents. Most research uses n-gram representations, but relevant features often occur discontinuously, e.g., not. . . good in sentiment analysis. In this paper we present experiments getting experts to provide regular expressions, as well as crowdsourced annotation tasks from which regular expressions can be derived. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that these crowdsourced feature combinations outperform automatic feature combination methods, as well as expert features, by a very large margin and reduce error by 24-41% over n-gram representations.</p><p>4 0.94911283 <a title="153-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Feature_Noising_for_Log-Linear_Structured_Prediction.html">86 emnlp-2013-Feature Noising for Log-Linear Structured Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Sida Wang ; Mengqiu Wang ; Stefan Wager ; Percy Liang ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: NLP models have many and sparse features, and regularization is key for balancing model overfitting versus underfitting. A recently repopularized form of regularization is to generate fake training data by repeatedly adding noise to real data. We reinterpret this noising as an explicit regularizer, and approximate it with a second-order formula that can be used during training without actually generating fake data. We show how to apply this method to structured prediction using multinomial logistic regression and linear-chain CRFs. We tackle the key challenge of developing a dynamic program to compute the gradient of the regularizer efficiently. The regularizer is a sum over inputs, so we can estimate it more accurately via a semi-supervised or transductive extension. Applied to text classification and NER, our method provides a > 1% absolute performance gain over use of standard L2 regularization.</p><p>5 0.94435406 <a title="153-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Recurrent_Continuous_Translation_Models.html">156 emnlp-2013-Recurrent Continuous Translation Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Nal Kalchbrenner ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a class of probabilistic continuous translation models called Recurrent Continuous Translation Models that are purely based on continuous representations for words, phrases and sentences and do not rely on alignments or phrasal translation units. The models have a generation and a conditioning aspect. The generation of the translation is modelled with a target Recurrent Language Model, whereas the conditioning on the source sentence is modelled with a Convolutional Sentence Model. Through various experiments, we show first that our models obtain a perplexity with respect to gold translations that is > 43% lower than that of stateof-the-art alignment-based translation models. Secondly, we show that they are remarkably sensitive to the word order, syntax, and meaning of the source sentence despite lacking alignments. Finally we show that they match a state-of-the-art system when rescoring n-best lists of translations.</p><p>6 0.9352935 <a title="153-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Growing_Multi-Domain_Glossaries_from_a_Few_Seeds_using_Probabilistic_Topic_Models.html">92 emnlp-2013-Growing Multi-Domain Glossaries from a Few Seeds using Probabilistic Topic Models</a></p>

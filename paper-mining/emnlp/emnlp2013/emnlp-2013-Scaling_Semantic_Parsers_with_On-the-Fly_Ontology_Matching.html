<h1>164 emnlp-2013-Scaling Semantic Parsers with On-the-Fly Ontology Matching</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2013-164-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1161.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Eunsol Choi ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We consider the challenge of learning semantic parsers that scale to large, open-domain problems, such as question answering with Freebase. In such settings, the sentences cover a wide variety of topics and include many phrases whose meaning is difficult to represent in a fixed target ontology. For example, even simple phrases such as ‘daughter’ and ‘number of people living in’ cannot be directly represented in Freebase, whose ontology instead encodes facts about gender, parenthood, and population. In this paper, we introduce a new semantic parsing approach that learns to resolve such ontological mismatches. The parser is learned from question-answer pairs, uses a probabilistic CCG to build linguistically motivated logicalform meaning representations, and includes an ontology matching model that adapts the output logical forms for each target ontology. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark semantic parsing datasets, including a nine point accuracy improvement on a recent Freebase QA corpus.</p><p>Reference: <a title="emnlp-2013-164-reference" href="../emnlp2013_reference/emnlp-2013-Scaling_Semantic_Parsers_with_On-the-Fly_Ontology_Matching_reference.html">text</a></p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 For example, even simple phrases such as ‘daughter’ and ‘number of people living in’ cannot be directly represented in Freebase, whose ontology instead encodes facts about gender, parenthood, and population.

</p><p>4 In each case, the parser uses a predefined set of logical constants, or an ontology, to construct meaning representations. [sent-14, score-0.502]

</p><p>10 This two stage approach enables parsing without any domain-dependent lexicon that pairs words with logical constants. [sent-49, score-0.47]
</p><p>11 Instead, word meaning is filled in on-the-fly through ontology matching, enabling the parser to infer the meaning of previously unseen words and more easily transfer across domains. [sent-50, score-0.37]
</p><p>12 The first parsing stage uses a probabilistic combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000; Clark and Curran, 2007) to map sentences to new, underspecified logical-form meaning represen-  tations containing generic logical constants that are not tied to any specific ontology. [sent-52, score-1.334]
</p><p>13 It enables us to incorporate a number of cues, including the target ontology structure and lexical similarity between the names of the domain-independent and dependent constants, to construct the final logical forms. [sent-55, score-0.629]
</p><p>14 During learning, we estimate a linear model over derivations that include all of the CCG parsing decisions and the choices for ontology matching. [sent-56, score-0.323]
</p><p>15 This approach aligns naturally with our two-stage parsing setup, where the final logical expression can be directly used to provide answers. [sent-60, score-0.471]

</p><p>22 The parser then maps this intermediate representation to a logical form that uses constants from O, such as the y seen in Figure 1. [sent-78, score-0.817]
</p><p>23 The lexicon is open domain, using no symbols from the ontology O for K. [sent-95, score-0.223]
</p><p>24 The  burden of learning word meaning is shifted to the second, ontology matching, stage of parsing (Section 5. [sent-98, score-0.311]
</p><p>25 However, these techniques require training data with hand-labeled domain-specific logical expressions. [sent-109, score-0.394]
</p><p>26 This approach was one of the first to scale to Freebase, but required labeled logical forms and did not jointly model semantic parsing and ontological reasoning. [sent-117, score-0.75]
</p><p>27 However, we introduce the idea of learning an open-domain CCG semantic parser; all previous methods suffered, to various degrees, from the ontological mismatch problem that motivates our work. [sent-121, score-0.253]
</p><p>28 The challenge of ontological mismatch has been previously recognized in many settings. [sent-122, score-0.209]
</p><p>29 Hobbs (1985) describes the need for ontological promiscuity in general language understanding. [sent-123, score-0.209]

</p><p>31 4  Background  Semantic Modeling We use the typed lambda calculus to build logical forms that represent the meanings of words, phrases and sentences. [sent-135, score-0.523]
</p><p>32 These are then combined using the set of CCG combinators to build a logical form that captures the meaning of the entire sentence. [sent-155, score-0.525]

</p><p>36 1 Domain Independent Parsing Domain-independent CCG parse trees Π are built using a predefined set of 56 underspecified lexi1548 cal categories, 49 domain-independent lexical items, and the combinatory rules introduced in Section 4. [sent-164, score-0.538]
</p><p>37 An underspecified CCG lexical category has a syntactic category and a logical form containing no constants from the domain ontology O. [sent-165, score-1.499]

</p><p>40 We manually define a set of POS tags for each underspecified lexical category, and use Wiktionary as a tag dictionary to define the possible POS tags for words and phrases. [sent-171, score-0.456]
</p><p>41 We accordingly assign it all underspecified categories for the classes, including: N : λx. [sent-174, score-0.417]
</p><p>42 Figure 3a shows the lexical categories and combinator applications used to construct the underspecified logical form l0. [sent-188, score-0.885]

</p><p>44 2 Ontological Matching The second, domain specific, step M maps the underspecified logical form l0 onto the fully specified logical form y. [sent-191, score-1.342]

</p><p>53 ’ Underspecified constants are labelled with the words from the query that they are associated with for readability. [sent-237, score-0.346]
</p><p>54 Collapses merge a subexpression from l0 to create a new underspecified constant, generating a logical form with fewer constants. [sent-281, score-0.89]
</p><p>55 Expansions split a subexpression from l0 to generate a new logical form containing one extra constant. [sent-282, score-0.473]
</p><p>56 Collapsing Operators The collapsing operator defined in Figure 4a merges all constants in a literal to generate a single constant of the same type. [sent-283, score-0.552]
</p><p>57 Performing collapses on the underspecified logical form allows non-contiguous phrases to be represented in the collapsed form. [sent-293, score-0.911]
</p><p>58 In this example, the logical form representing the phrase ‘how many people visit’ has been merged with the logical form representing the non-adjacent adverb ‘annually. [sent-294, score-0.858]
</p><p>59 ’ This generates a new underspecified constant that can be mapped onto the Freebase relation public library system annual visits that relates to both phrases. [sent-295, score-0.589]
</p><p>60 The collapsing operations preserve semantic type, ensuring that all logical forms generated by the derivation sequence are well typed. [sent-296, score-0.58]
</p><p>61 The size of this set is limited by the number of constants in l0, since each collapse removes at least one constant. [sent-298, score-0.375]
</p><p>62 At each step, the number of possible collapses is polynomial in the number of constants in l0 and exponential in the arity of the most complex type in O. [sent-299, score-0.411]
</p><p>63 Expansion Operators The fully specified logical form y can contain constants relating to multiple words in x. [sent-302, score-0.811]
</p><p>64 It can also use multiple constants to represent the meaning of a single word. [sent-303, score-0.412]
</p><p>65 2 Constant Matching To build an executable logical form y, all underspecified constants must be replaced with constants from O. [sent-311, score-1.538]
</p><p>66 This is done through a sequence of consftroamnt replacement operations, gehac ah osefq qwuehnicche replaces a single underspecified constant with a constant of the same type from O. [sent-312, score-0.662]
</p><p>67 TTwheo output flreo mrep pthlaec lemaste replacement operation is a fully specified logical form. [sent-315, score-0.473]
</p><p>68 However, each logical form (both final and interim) can be constructed with many different derivations, and we only need to find the highest scoring one. [sent-319, score-0.459]
</p><p>69 We use a CKY style chart parser to calculate the k-best logical forms output by parses of x. [sent-321, score-0.49]
</p><p>70 We then store each interim logical form generated by an operator in M once in a hyper-graph chart structure. [sent-322, score-0.52]
</p><p>71 The branching factor of this hypergraph is polynomial in the number of constants in l0 and linear in the size of O. [sent-323, score-0.346]
</p><p>72 Subsequently, there are too many possible logical forms to enumerate explicitly; we prune as follows. [sent-324, score-0.448]
</p><p>73 We allow the top N scoring ontological matches for each original subexpression in l0 and remove matches that differ from score from the maximum scoring match by more than a threshold τ. [sent-325, score-0.313]
</p><p>74 When building derivations, we apply constant matching operators as soon as they are applicable to new underspecified constants created by collapses and expansions. [sent-326, score-1.061]

</p><p>78 1) in M generate new underspecified constants that define the types of constants in the output logical form y. [sent-374, score-1.538]
</p><p>79 These operators are scored using features that indicate the type of each complex-typed constant present in y and the identity of domain-independent functional constants in y. [sent-375, score-0.499]
</p><p>80 The logical form y generated in Figure 3 contains one complex typed constant with type hi, he, tii and no domain-independent tfuanntc wtioitnhal t ycpoens hit,anhtes,. [sent-376, score-0.561]

</p><p>82 The underspecified constant cu is associatefdr owmith O th. [sent-383, score-0.608]
</p><p>83 We assume that each of the constants cO in O is associated with a string label w~ O. [sent-385, score-0.346]
</p><p>84 The feature φnp(cu, cO) signals the replacement of an entity-typed constant cu with entity cO that has label For the second example in Figure 1 this feature indicates the replacement of the underspecified constant associated with the word ‘mozart’ with the Freebase entity mo z art.

</p><p>87 FQ contains 917 questions labeled with logical form meaning representations for querying Freebase. [sent-415, score-0.556]
</p><p>88 We gathered question answer labels by executing the logical forms against Freebase, and manually correcting any inconsistencies. [sent-416, score-0.478]
</p><p>89 We report two different experiments on the FQ data: test results on the existing 642/275 train/test split and domain adaptation results where the data is split three ways, partitioning the topics so that the logical meaning expressions do not share any symbols across folds. [sent-421, score-0.46]
</p><p>90 We initialize weights for φpp and φemp to -1 to favour logical forms that have an interpretation in the knowledge base K. [sent-425, score-0.448]
</p><p>91 CY13 and FUBL report fully correct logical forms, which is a close proxy to our numbers. [sent-442, score-0.394]
</p><p>92 93 approach outperforms the previous state of the art, achieving a nine point improvement in test recall,  while not requiring labeled logical forms in training. [sent-451, score-0.448]

</p><p>94 The first and second examples show parse failures, where the underspecified CCG grammar did not have sufficient coverage. [sent-487, score-0.463]
</p><p>95 The third shows a failed structural match, where all of the correct logical constants are selected, but the argument order is reversed for one of the literals. [sent-488, score-0.74]

<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Eunsol Choi ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We consider the challenge of learning semantic parsers that scale to large, open-domain problems, such as question answering with Freebase. In such settings, the sentences cover a wide variety of topics and include many phrases whose meaning is difficult to represent in a fixed target ontology. For example, even simple phrases such as ‘daughter’ and ‘number of people living in’ cannot be directly represented in Freebase, whose ontology instead encodes facts about gender, parenthood, and population. In this paper, we introduce a new semantic parsing approach that learns to resolve such ontological mismatches. The parser is learned from question-answer pairs, uses a probabilistic CCG to build linguistically motivated logicalform meaning representations, and includes an ontology matching model that adapts the output logical forms for each target ontology. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark semantic parsing datasets, including a nine point accuracy improvement on a recent Freebase QA corpus.</p><p>2 0.37722576 <a title="164-tfidf-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Semantic_Parsing_on_Freebase_from_Question-Answer_Pairs.html">166 emnlp-2013-Semantic Parsing on Freebase from Question-Answer Pairs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Andrew Chou ; Roy Frostig ; Percy Liang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we train a semantic parser that scales up to Freebase. Instead of relying on annotated logical forms, which is especially expensive to obtain at large scale, we learn from question-answer pairs. The main challenge in this setting is narrowing down the huge number of possible logical predicates for a given question. We tackle this problem in two ways: First, we build a coarse mapping from phrases to predicates using a knowledge base and a large text corpus. Second, we use a bridging operation to generate additional predicates based on neighboring predicates. On the dataset ofCai and Yates (2013), despite not having annotated logical forms, our system outperforms their state-of-the-art parser. Additionally, we collected a more realistic and challenging dataset of question-answer pairs and improves over a natural baseline.</p><p>3 0.28293455 <a title="164-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Distributions_over_Logical_Forms_for_Referring_Expression_Generation.html">119 emnlp-2013-Learning Distributions over Logical Forms for Referring Expression Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas FitzGerald ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to referring expression generation, casting it as a density estimation problem where the goal is to learn distributions over logical expressions identifying sets of objects in the world. Despite an extremely large space of possible expressions, we demonstrate effective learning of a globally normalized log-linear distribution. This learning is enabled by a new, multi-stage approximate inference technique that uses a pruning model to construct only the most likely logical forms. We train and evaluate the approach on a new corpus of references to sets of visual objects.

<p>Author: Mike Lewis ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: Creating a language-independent meaning representation would benefit many crosslingual NLP tasks. We introduce the first unsupervised approach to this problem, learning clusters of semantically equivalent English and French relations between referring expressions, based on their named-entity arguments in large monolingual corpora. The clusters can be used as language-independent semantic relations, by mapping clustered expressions in different languages onto the same relation. Our approach needs no parallel text for training, but outperforms a baseline that uses machine translation on a cross-lingual question answering task.

<p>Author: Hrushikesh Mohapatra ; Siddhanth Jain ; Soumen Chakrabarti</p><p>Abstract: Web search can be enhanced in powerful ways if token spans in Web text are annotated with disambiguated entities from large catalogs like Freebase. Entity annotators need to be trained on sample mention snippets. Wikipedia entities and annotated pages offer high-quality labeled data for training and evaluation. Unfortunately, Wikipedia features only one-ninth the number of entities as Freebase, and these are a highly biased sample of well-connected, frequently mentioned “head” entities. To bring hope to “tail” entities, we broaden our goal to a second task: assigning types to entities in Freebase but not Wikipedia. The two tasks are synergistic: knowing the types of unfamiliar entities helps disambiguate mentions, and words in mention contexts help assign types to entities. We present TMI, a bipartite graphical model for joint type-mention inference. TMI attempts no schema integration or entity resolution, but exploits the above-mentioned synergy. In experiments involving 780,000 people in Wikipedia, 2.3 million people in Freebase, 700 million Web pages, and over 20 professional editors, TMI shows considerable annotation accuracy improvement (e.g., 70%) compared to baselines (e.g., 46%), especially for “tail” and emerging entities. We also compare with Google’s recent annotations of the same corpus with Freebase entities, and report considerable improvements within the people domain.</p><p>6 0.10588652 <a title="164-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Connecting_Language_and_Knowledge_Bases_with_Embedding_Models_for_Relation_Extraction.html">51 emnlp-2013-Connecting Language and Knowledge Bases with Embedding Models for Relation Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Eunsol Choi ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We consider the challenge of learning semantic parsers that scale to large, open-domain problems, such as question answering with Freebase. In such settings, the sentences cover a wide variety of topics and include many phrases whose meaning is difficult to represent in a fixed target ontology. For example, even simple phrases such as ‘daughter’ and ‘number of people living in’ cannot be directly represented in Freebase, whose ontology instead encodes facts about gender, parenthood, and population. In this paper, we introduce a new semantic parsing approach that learns to resolve such ontological mismatches. The parser is learned from question-answer pairs, uses a probabilistic CCG to build linguistically motivated logicalform meaning representations, and includes an ontology matching model that adapts the output logical forms for each target ontology. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark semantic parsing datasets, including a nine point accuracy improvement on a recent Freebase QA corpus.</p><p>2 0.84629649 <a title="164-lsi-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Semantic_Parsing_on_Freebase_from_Question-Answer_Pairs.html">166 emnlp-2013-Semantic Parsing on Freebase from Question-Answer Pairs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Berant ; Andrew Chou ; Roy Frostig ; Percy Liang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we train a semantic parser that scales up to Freebase. Instead of relying on annotated logical forms, which is especially expensive to obtain at large scale, we learn from question-answer pairs. The main challenge in this setting is narrowing down the huge number of possible logical predicates for a given question. We tackle this problem in two ways: First, we build a coarse mapping from phrases to predicates using a knowledge base and a large text corpus. Second, we use a bridging operation to generate additional predicates based on neighboring predicates. On the dataset ofCai and Yates (2013), despite not having annotated logical forms, our system outperforms their state-of-the-art parser. Additionally, we collected a more realistic and challenging dataset of question-answer pairs and improves over a natural baseline.</p><p>3 0.74893361 <a title="164-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Distributions_over_Logical_Forms_for_Referring_Expression_Generation.html">119 emnlp-2013-Learning Distributions over Logical Forms for Referring Expression Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas FitzGerald ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We present a new approach to referring expression generation, casting it as a density estimation problem where the goal is to learn distributions over logical expressions identifying sets of objects in the world. Despite an extremely large space of possible expressions, we demonstrate effective learning of a globally normalized log-linear distribution. This learning is enabled by a new, multi-stage approximate inference technique that uses a pruning model to construct only the most likely logical forms. We train and evaluate the approach on a new corpus of references to sets of visual objects. Experiments show the approach is able to learn accurate models, which generate over 87% of the expressions people used. Additionally, on the previously studied special case of single object reference, we show a 35% relative error reduction over previous state of the art.</p><p>4 0.53929329 <a title="164-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Unsupervised_Induction_of_Cross-Lingual_Semantic_Relations.html">193 emnlp-2013-Unsupervised Induction of Cross-Lingual Semantic Relations</a></p>

In this work we combine the output of a discriminative at-least-one learner with that of a generative hierarchical topic model to reduce the noise in distant supervision data. The combination significantly increases the ranking quality of extracted facts and achieves state-of-the-art extraction performance in an end-to-end setting. A simple linear interpolation of the model scores performs better than a parameter-free scheme based on nondominated sorting.</p><p>2 0.97649652 <a title="164-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised_Representation_Learning_for_Cross-Lingual_Text_Classification.html">169 emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised Representation Learning for Cross-Lingual Text Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Min Xiao ; Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual adaptation aims to learn a prediction model in a label-scarce target language by exploiting labeled data from a labelrich source language. An effective crosslingual adaptation system can substantially reduce the manual annotation effort required in many natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose a new cross-lingual adaptation approach for document classification based on learning cross-lingual discriminative distributed representations of words. Specifically, we propose to maximize the loglikelihood of the documents from both language domains under a cross-lingual logbilinear document model, while minimizing the prediction log-losses of labeled documents. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks of Amazon product reviews. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the pro- posed cross-lingual adaptation approach.</p><p>3 0.94375873 <a title="164-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Left-to-Right_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation_with_Improved_Reordering.html">71 emnlp-2013-Efficient Left-to-Right Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation with Improved Reordering</a></p>
<p>Author: Maryam Siahbani ; Baskaran Sankaran ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: Left-to-right (LR) decoding (Watanabe et al., 2006b) is a promising decoding algorithm for hierarchical phrase-based translation (Hiero). It generates the target sentence by extending the hypotheses only on the right edge. LR decoding has complexity O(n2b) for input of n words and beam size b, compared to O(n3) for the CKY algorithm. It requires a single language model (LM) history for each target hypothesis rather than two LM histories per hypothesis as in CKY. In this paper we present an augmented LR decoding algorithm that builds on the original algorithm in (Watanabe et al., 2006b). Unlike that algorithm, using experiments over multiple language pairs we show two new results: our LR decoding algorithm provides demonstrably more efficient decoding than CKY Hiero, four times faster; and by introducing new distortion and reordering features for LR decoding, it maintains the same translation quality (as in BLEU scores) ob- tained phrase-based and CKY Hiero with the same translation model.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.93120873 <a title="164-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Scaling_Semantic_Parsers_with_On-the-Fly_Ontology_Matching.html">164 emnlp-2013-Scaling Semantic Parsers with On-the-Fly Ontology Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Min Xiao ; Feipeng Zhao ; Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation has been popularly studied on exploiting labeled information from a source domain to learn a prediction model in a target domain. In this paper, we develop a novel representation learning approach to address domain adaptation for text classification with automatically induced discriminative latent features, which are generalizable across domains while informative to the prediction task. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical multinomial Naive Bayes model with latent variables to conduct supervised word clustering on labeled documents from both source and target domains, and then use the produced cluster distribution of each word as its latent feature representation for domain adaptation. We train this latent graphical model us- ing a simple expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We empirically evaluate the proposed method with both cross-domain document categorization tasks on Reuters-21578 dataset and cross-domain sentiment classification tasks on Amazon product review dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance compared with alternative methods.</p><p>6 0.87200862 <a title="164-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Connecting_Language_and_Knowledge_Bases_with_Embedding_Models_for_Relation_Extraction.html">51 emnlp-2013-Connecting Language and Knowledge Bases with Embedding Models for Relation Extraction</a></p>

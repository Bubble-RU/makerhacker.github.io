<p>Author: Min Xiao ; Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual adaptation aims to learn a prediction model in a label-scarce target language by exploiting labeled data from a labelrich source language. An effective crosslingual adaptation system can substantially reduce the manual annotation effort required in many natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose a new cross-lingual adaptation approach for document classification based on learning cross-lingual discriminative distributed representations of words. Specifically, we propose to maximize the loglikelihood of the documents from both language domains under a cross-lingual logbilinear document model, while minimizing the prediction log-losses of labeled documents. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks of Amazon product reviews. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the pro- posed cross-lingual adaptation approach.</p><p>3 0.24014908 <a title="120-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatic_Domain_Partitioning_for_Multi-Domain_Learning.html">29 emnlp-2013-Automatic Domain Partitioning for Multi-Domain Learning</a></p>

Multi-Domain learning (MDL) assumes that the domain labels in the dataset are known. However, when there are multiple metadata at- tributes available, it is not always straightforward to select a single best attribute for domain partition, and it is possible that combining more than one metadata attributes (including continuous attributes) can lead to better MDL performance. In this work, we propose an automatic domain partitioning approach that aims at providing better domain identities for MDL. We use a supervised clustering approach that learns the domain distance between data instances , and then cluster the data into better domains for MDL. Our experiment on real multi-domain datasets shows that using our automatically generated domain partition improves over popular MDL methods.</p><p>4 0.20102949 <a title="120-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Open_Domain_Targeted_Sentiment.html">143 emnlp-2013-Open Domain Targeted Sentiment</a></p>
<p>Author: Margaret Mitchell ; Jacqui Aguilar ; Theresa Wilson ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to sentiment analysis for a low resource setting. The intuition behind this work is that sentiment expressed towards an entity, targeted sentiment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment expressed across the entity. This representation allows us to model sentiment detection as a sequence tagging problem, jointly discovering people and organizations along with whether there is sentiment directed towards them. We compare performance in both Spanish and English on microblog data, using only a sentiment lexicon as an external resource. By leveraging linguisticallyinformed features within conditional random fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empirical risk, our best models in Spanish significantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach around 90% accuracy on the combined task of named entity recognition and sentiment prediction. Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.</p><p>5 0.16047832 <a title="120-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Multi-Domain_Adaptation_for_SMT_Using_Multi-Task_Learning.html">136 emnlp-2013-Multi-Domain Adaptation for SMT Using Multi-Task Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Cui ; Xilun Chen ; Dongdong Zhang ; Shujie Liu ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation for SMT usually adapts models to an individual specific domain. However, it often lacks some correlation among different domains where common knowledge could be shared to improve the overall translation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain adaptation approach for SMT using Multi-Task Learning (MTL), with in-domain models tailored for each specific domain and a general-domain model shared by different domains. The parameters of these models are tuned jointly via MTL so that they can learn general knowledge more accurately and exploit domain knowledge better. Our experiments on a largescale English-to-Chinese translation task validate that the MTL-based adaptation approach significantly and consistently improves the translation quality compared to a non-adapted baseline. Furthermore, it also outperforms the individual adaptation of each specific domain.</p><p>6 0.13074942 <a title="120-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Naive_Bayes_Word_Sense_Induction.html">138 emnlp-2013-Naive Bayes Word Sense Induction</a></p>

We train this latent graphical model us- ing a simple expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We empirically evaluate the proposed method with both cross-domain document categorization tasks on Reuters-21578 dataset and cross-domain sentiment classification tasks on Amazon product review dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance compared with alternative methods.</p><p>4 0.68050283 <a title="120-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Recursive_Deep_Models_for_Semantic_Compositionality_Over_a_Sentiment_Treebank.html">158 emnlp-2013-Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Alex Perelygin ; Jean Wu ; Jason Chuang ; Christopher D. Manning ; Andrew Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Semantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning of longer phrases in a principled way. Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.</p><p>5 0.67529172 <a title="120-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Studying_the_Recursive_Behaviour_of_Adjectival_Modification_with_Compositional_Distributional_Semantics.html">177 emnlp-2013-Studying the Recursive Behaviour of Adjectival Modification with Compositional Distributional Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Eva Maria Vecchi ; Roberto Zamparelli ; Marco Baroni</p><p>Abstract: In this study, we use compositional distributional semantic methods to investigate restrictions in adjective ordering. Specifically, we focus on properties distinguishing AdjectiveAdjective-Noun phrases in which there is flexibility in the adjective ordering from those bound to a rigid order. We explore a number of measures extracted from the distributional representation of AAN phrases which may indicate a word order restriction. We find that we are able to distinguish the relevant classes and the correct order based primarily on the degree of modification of the adjectives. Our results offer fresh insight into the semantic properties that determine adjective ordering, building a bridge between syntax and distributional semantics.</p><p>6 0.66954225 <a title="120-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Prior_Disambiguation_of_Word_Tensors_for_Constructing_Sentence_Vectors.html">154 emnlp-2013-Prior Disambiguation of Word Tensors for Constructing Sentence Vectors</a></p>

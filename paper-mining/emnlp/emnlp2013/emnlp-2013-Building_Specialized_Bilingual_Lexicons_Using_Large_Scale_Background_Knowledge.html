<p>Author: Ivan Vulic ; Marie-Francine Moens</p><p>Abstract: We present a new language pair agnostic approach to inducing bilingual vector spaces from non-parallel data without any other resource in a bootstrapping fashion. The paper systematically introduces and describes all key elements of the bootstrapping procedure: (1) starting point or seed lexicon, (2) the confidence estimation and selection of new dimensions of the space, and (3) convergence. We test the quality of the induced bilingual vector spaces, and analyze the influence of the different components of the bootstrapping approach in the task of bilingual lexicon extraction (BLE) for two language pairs. Results reveal that, contrary to conclusions from prior work, the seeding of the bootstrapping process has a heavy impact on the quality of the learned lexicons. We also show that our approach outperforms the best performing fully corpus-based BLE methods on these test sets.</p><p>3 0.1807258 <a title="42-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Monolingual_Marginal_Matching_for_Translation_Model_Adaptation.html">135 emnlp-2013-Monolingual Marginal Matching for Translation Model Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ann Irvine ; Chris Quirk ; Hal Daume III</p><p>Abstract: When using a machine translation (MT) model trained on OLD-domain parallel data to translate NEW-domain text, one major challenge is the large number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and new-translation-sense words. We present a method to identify new translations of both known and unknown source language words that uses NEW-domain comparable document pairs. Starting with a joint distribution of source-target word pairs derived from the OLD-domain parallel corpus, our method recovers a new joint distribution that matches the marginal distributions of the NEW-domain comparable document pairs, while minimizing the divergence from the OLD-domain distribution. Adding learned translations to our French-English MT model results in gains of about 2 BLEU points over strong baselines.</p><p>4 0.16274484 <a title="42-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised_Representation_Learning_for_Cross-Lingual_Text_Classification.html">169 emnlp-2013-Semi-Supervised Representation Learning for Cross-Lingual Text Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Min Xiao ; Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual adaptation aims to learn a prediction model in a label-scarce target language by exploiting labeled data from a labelrich source language. An effective crosslingual adaptation system can substantially reduce the manual annotation effort required in many natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose a new cross-lingual adaptation approach for document classification based on learning cross-lingual discriminative distributed representations of words. Specifically, we propose to maximize the loglikelihood of the documents from both language domains under a cross-lingual logbilinear document model, while minimizing the prediction log-losses of labeled documents. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks of Amazon product reviews. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the pro- posed cross-lingual adaptation approach.</p><p>5 0.15270902 <a title="42-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Multi-Domain_Adaptation_for_SMT_Using_Multi-Task_Learning.html">136 emnlp-2013-Multi-Domain Adaptation for SMT Using Multi-Task Learning</a></p>

However, it often lacks some correlation among different domains where common knowledge could be shared to improve the overall translation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain adaptation approach for SMT using Multi-Task Learning (MTL), with in-domain models tailored for each specific domain and a general-domain model shared by different domains. The parameters of these models are tuned jointly via MTL so that they can learn general knowledge more accurately and exploit domain knowledge better.

Answers</a></p>
<p>Author: Baichuan Li ; Jing Liu ; Chin-Yew Lin ; Irwin King ; Michael R. Lyu</p><p>Abstract: Social media like forums and microblogs have accumulated a huge amount of user generated content (UGC) containing human knowledge. Currently, most of UGC is listed as a whole or in pre-defined categories. This “list-based” approach is simple, but hinders users from browsing and learning knowledge of certain topics effectively. To address this problem, we propose a hierarchical entity-based approach for structuralizing UGC in social media. By using a large-scale entity repository, we design a three-step framework to organize UGC in a novel hierarchical structure called “cluster entity tree (CET)”. With Yahoo! Answers as a test case, we conduct experiments and the results show the effectiveness of our framework in constructing CET. We further evaluate the performance of CET on UGC organization in both user and system aspects. From a user aspect, our user study demonstrates that, with CET-based structure, users perform significantly better in knowledge learning than using traditional list-based approach. From a system aspect, CET substantially boosts the performance of two information retrieval models (i.e., vector space model and query likelihood language model).</p><p>4 0.57228458 <a title="42-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Combining_PCFG-LA_Models_with_Dual_Decomposition%3A_A_Case_Study_with_Function_Labels_and_Binarization.html">50 emnlp-2013-Combining PCFG-LA Models with Dual Decomposition: A Case Study with Function Labels and Binarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Le Roux ; Antoine Rozenknop ; Jennifer Foster</p><p>Abstract: It has recently been shown that different NLP models can be effectively combined using dual decomposition. In this paper we demonstrate that PCFG-LA parsing models are suitable for combination in this way. We experiment with the different models which result from alternative methods of extracting a grammar from a treebank (retaining or discarding function labels, left binarization versus right binarization) and achieve a labeled Parseval F-score of 92.4 on Wall Street Journal Section 23 this represents an absolute improvement of 0.7 and an error reduction rate of 7% over a strong PCFG-LA product-model baseline. Although we experiment only with binarization and function labels in this study, there is much scope for applying this approach to – other grammar extraction strategies.</p><p>5 0.57207078 <a title="42-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Multiple_Sources_for_Open-Domain_Hypernym_Discovery.html">79 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Multiple Sources for Open-Domain Hypernym Discovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruiji Fu ; Bing Qin ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: Hypernym discovery aims to extract such noun pairs that one noun is a hypernym of the other. Most previous methods are based on lexical patterns but perform badly on opendomain data. Other work extracts hypernym relations from encyclopedias but has limited coverage. This paper proposes a simple yet effective distant supervision framework for Chinese open-domain hypernym discovery. Given an entity name, we try to discover its hypernyms by leveraging knowledge from multiple sources, i.e., search engine results, encyclopedias, and morphology of the entity name. First, we extract candidate hypernyms from the above sources. Then, we apply a statistical ranking model to select correct hypernyms. A set of novel features is proposed for the rank- ing model. We also present a heuristic strategy to build a large-scale noisy training data for the model without human annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset.</p><p>6 0.57091659 <a title="42-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Collective_Personal_Profile_Summarization_with_Social_Networks.html">48 emnlp-2013-Collective Personal Profile Summarization with Social Networks</a></p>

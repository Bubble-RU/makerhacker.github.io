</p><p>9 2  The Wikification Approach  A general Wikification decision consists of three computational components: (1) generating a ranked list of title candidates for each mention, (2) ranking candidates globally, and (3) dealing with NIL mentions. [sent-62, score-0.459]

</p><p>19 Most of our discussion addresses the relational analysis and its impact on stage (2) and (3) above. [sent-81, score-0.242]
</p><p>20 We use two types of boolean variables: eik is used to denote whether we disambiguate mi to tik (Γ(mi)  = tik) or not. [sent-85, score-0.416]
</p><p>21 r(ikj,l)  is used to denote if  1789 titles tik and tjl are chosen simultaneously, that is,  r(ikj,l)  = eik ∧ ejl. [sent-86, score-0.53]
</p><p>22 Our mod∧el es determine two types of score for the boolean variables above: sik = Pr(eik) = Pr(Γ(mi) = tik), represents the initial score for the kth candidate title being chosen for mention mi. [sent-87, score-0.453]
</p><p>23 For a pair of titles (tik, tjl), we denote the confidence of  w(ikj,l). [sent-88, score-0.171]
</p><p>24 finding a relation between them by Its value depends on the textual relation type and on how coherent it is with our existing knowledge. [sent-89, score-0.282]
</p><p>25 Our goal is to find the best assignment to variables eik, such that it satisfies some legitimacy (hard) constraints and the soft constraints dictated by the  w(ikj,l)). [sent-90, score-0.12]
</p><p>26 relational constraints (via scores To accomplish that we define our objective function as a Constrained Conditional Model (CCM) (Roth and Yih, 2004; Chang et al. [sent-91, score-0.288]
</p><p>27 , 2012) that is used to reward or penalize a pair of candidates tik, tjl by when  w(ikj,l)  they are chosen in the same document. [sent-92, score-0.182]
</p><p>28 The key challenge in incorporating relational analysis into the Wikification decision is to systematically construct the relational constraints (the solid edges between candidates in Figure 1) and incorpo-  rate them into our inference framework. [sent-97, score-0.646]

</p><p>31 Here,  searching the external KB reveals that Slobodan Milo ˇsevi c´ is the founder of the Socialist Party of Serbia, which can be referred to by the surface Socialist Party; we therefore reward the output containing this pair of candidates. [sent-113, score-0.137]
</p><p>32 idea applies for the relation “Slobodan well as to the  coreference  The same  Milo ˇsevi c´ holds office as President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia”  relation between two mentions  of Slobodan  as  Milo ˇsevi c´. [sent-114, score-0.514]
</p><p>33 We determine the weights by combining type and confidence of the relation extracted from text with the confidence in relations retrieved from an external Knowledge Base (KB) by using the mention pairs as a query. [sent-116, score-0.457]
</p><p>34 1 we describe how we extract relations from text; our goal is to reliably identify arguments  that we hypothesize to be in a relation; we show that this is essential both to our candidate generation, our ranking and the mapping to NIL. [sent-120, score-0.248]
</p><p>35 3 shows how we generate scores for the mentions and relations, as coefficients in the objective function of Sec. [sent-126, score-0.198]
</p><p>36 Unlike the general ACE RDC task, we can restrict relation arguments to be named entities and thus leverage the large number of known relations in  existing databases (e. [sent-132, score-0.388]
</p><p>37 We also consider conference relations that potentially aid mapping different mentions to the same title. [sent-135, score-0.292]
</p><p>38 A purely statistical approach would very likely map the entity [Ministry of Defense]2 to Ministry of Defense (Israel) instead of Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (Iran) because the context is more coherent with concepts related to Israel rather than to Iran. [sent-143, score-0.121]
</p><p>39 Nevertheless, the pre-modifier relation between [Iranian]1 and [Ministry of Defense]2 demands the answer to be tightly related to Iran. [sent-144, score-0.113]
</p><p>40 Even though human readers may not know the correct title needed here, understanding the pre-modifier relation allows them to easily filter through a list of candidates and enforce constraints that are derived jointly from the relation expressed in the text and their background knowledge. [sent-145, score-0.696]
</p><p>41 In our attempt to mimic this general approach, we  employ several high precision classifiers to resolve 1790  a range of local relations that are used to retrieve relevant background knowledge, and consequently integrated into our inference framework. [sent-146, score-0.185]
</p><p>42 In the above example, Iranian Ministry of Defense would be decomposed into Iranian and Ministry of Defense and our relation extraction process hypothesizes a relation between these arguments. [sent-149, score-0.226]
</p><p>43 The following example illustrates the importance of under-  standing co-reference relations in Wikification: Ex. [sent-154, score-0.128]
</p><p>44 Clearly [Goldman]2 refers to the same person and should be mapped to the same entity (or to NIL) rather than popular entities frequently referred to as Goldman, coherent with context or not, such as Goldman Sachs. [sent-164, score-0.177]
</p><p>45 To accomplish that, we cluster named entities that share tokens or are acronyms of each other when there is no ambiguity (e. [sent-165, score-0.128]
</p><p>46 no other longer named entity mentions containing Goldman in the document) and use a voting algorithm (Algorithm 2) to generate candidates locally from within the clusters. [sent-167, score-0.413]
</p><p>47 3 Coreferent Nominal Mentions Document level coreference also provides important relations between named entities and nominal mentions. [sent-171, score-0.384]
</p><p>48 Extracting these relations proved to be very useful for classifying NIL entities, as unfamil-  iar concepts tend to be introduced with these suc1791 cinct appositional nominal mentions. [sent-172, score-0.205]
</p><p>49 That is, it allows us to determine whether the target mention corresponds to a candidate title. [sent-174, score-0.2]

</p><p>52 between Dorothy Byrne and Florida Green Party) to determine whether any candidates of Dorothy Byrne can entail the nominal mention. [sent-182, score-0.203]
</p><p>53 Instead, we make use of relational queries to generate a more likely set of candidates. [sent-186, score-0.21]
</p><p>54 Once mention pairs are generated from text using the syntactico-semantic structures and coreference, we use these to query our KB of relational triples. [sent-187, score-0.387]
</p><p>55 We first indexed all Wikipedia links and DBpedia relations as unordered triples σ = (ti, p, tj), where the arguments ti, tj are tokenized, stemmed and lowercased for best recall. [sent-188, score-0.259]
</p><p>56 Since our baseline system has approximately 80% accuracy at this stage, it is reasonable to assume that at least one of the argument mentions is correctly disambiguated. [sent-190, score-0.164]
</p><p>57 Therefore we prune the search space by making only two queries for each mention pair  (mi, mj) : q0 = (ti∗ , mj) and q1 = (mi, tj∗) where ti∗ , tj∗ are the strings representing the top titles chosen by the current model for mentions mi, mj respectively. [sent-191, score-0.478]
</p><p>58 4, only keeping the arguments that are known to be possible or very likely candidates of the mention, based on the ambiguity that exists in the query result. [sent-194, score-0.223]
</p><p>59 We consider adding new title candidates from two sources, through the coreference module and through the combined DBpedia and Wikipedia inter-page link structures. [sent-198, score-0.478]
</p><p>60 1 Scoring Knowledge Base Relations Our model uses both explicit relations p LINK from DBpedia and Wikipedia hyperlinks p = LINK (implicit relation). [sent-202, score-0.128]
</p><p>61 We want to favor  =  relations with explicit predicate, each weighted as φ implicit relation (we use φ = 5 in our experiments, noting the results are insensitive to slight changes of this parameter). [sent-203, score-0.241]
</p><p>62 Note that we do not check the type of the relation against the textual relation. [sent-207, score-0.169]
</p><p>63 The key reason is that explicit relations are not as robust, especially considering that we restrict one of the arguments in the relation and constraining the other argument’s lexical form. [sent-208, score-0.3]
</p><p>64 Moreover, we back off to restricting the relations to be between known candidates when multiple lexically matched arguments are retrieved with high ambiguity. [sent-209, score-0.312]
</p><p>65 Additionally, most of our relations  1http : / / lucene . [sent-210, score-0.128]
</p><p>66 2 Scoring Coreference Relations For coreference relations, we simply use hard constraints by assigning candidates in the same coreference cluster a high relational weight, which is a cheap approximation to penalizing the output where the coreferent mentions disambiguate to different titles. [sent-220, score-0.923]
</p><p>67 Another important issue here is that the correct coreferent candidate might not exist in the candidate list of the shorter mentions in the cluster. [sent-222, score-0.369]
</p><p>68 For example, if a mention has the surface Richard, the number of potential candidates is so large that any top K list of titles will not be informative. [sent-223, score-0.525]
</p><p>69 We therefore ignore candidates generated from short surface strings and give it the same candidate list as the head mentions in its cluster. [sent-224, score-0.474]
</p><p>70 Figure 2 shows the voting algorithm we use to elect the potential candidates for the cluster. [sent-225, score-0.125]
</p><p>71 The reason for separating the votes of longer and shorter mentions is that shorter mentions are inherently more ambiguous. [sent-226, score-0.328]
</p><p>72 Once a coreferent relation is determined, longer mentions in the cluster should dictate what this cluster should collectively refer to. [sent-227, score-0.409]
</p><p>73 4 Candidate Generation Beyond the algorithmic improvements, the mention and candidate generation stage is aided by a few systematic preprocessing improvement briefly described below. [sent-229, score-0.198]
</p><p>74 1 Mention Segmentation Since named entities may sometimes overlap with each other, we use regular expressions to match longer surface forms that are often incorrectly segmented or ignored by NER 2 due to different annotation standards. [sent-232, score-0.181]
</p><p>75 The regular expression pattern we used for Step 1in Algorithm 1 simply adds mentions formed by any two consecutive capitalized word chunks connected by up to 2 punctuation marks, prepositions, and the tokens “the”, “’s” & “and”. [sent-234, score-0.164]
</p><p>76 These segments are also used as arguments for relation extraction. [sent-235, score-0.172]
</p><p>77 2 Lexical Search We link certain mentions directly to their exact matching titles in Step 3 when there is very low ambiguity. [sent-238, score-0.386]
</p><p>78 Specifically, when no title is known for a mention that is relatively long and fuzzily matches the lexically retrieved title, we perform this aggressive linking. [sent-239, score-0.283]
</p><p>79 We only accept the link if there exists exactly one title in the lexical searching result after pruning. [sent-242, score-0.229]
</p><p>80 , 2011) to initialize the candidates and corresponding priors sik in our objective function. [sent-252, score-0.234]
</p><p>81 The AQUAINT dataset, originally introduced in (Milne and Witten, 2008), resembles the Wikipedia annotation structure in that only the first mention of a title is linked, and is thus less sensitive to coreference capabilities. [sent-257, score-0.407]
</p><p>82 The MSNBC dataset is from (Cucerzan, 2007) and includes many mentions that do not easily map to Wikipedia titles due to rare surface or other idiosyncratic lexicalization (Cucerzan, 2007; Ratinov et al. [sent-258, score-0.428]
</p><p>83 For each document, the gold bag of titles is evaluated against our bag of system output titles requiring exact segmentation match. [sent-266, score-0.342]
</p><p>84 The Coreference performance includes all the inference performed without the KB triples, while the Relational Inference (RI) line represents all aspects of the proposed relational inference. [sent-295, score-0.267]
</p><p>85 Given the TAC Knowledge Base (TKB), which is a subset of the 2009 Wikipedia Dump, the TAC Entity Linking objective is to answer a named entity query string with either a TKB entry ID or a NIL entity ID, where the NIL entity IDs should be clustered across documents. [sent-304, score-0.373]
</p><p>86 Due to the clustering requirement, we also trivially cluster NIL entities that either are mapped to the same out-of-KB Wikipedia URL or have the  same surface form. [sent-308, score-0.222]
</p><p>87 RI is the complete relational inference system described in this paper; as described in the text, RI was not trained on the TAC data, unlike the other top systems. [sent-313, score-0.267]
</p><p>88 We performed two runs on the TAC201 1 data to study the effects of relational inference. [sent-314, score-0.21]
</p><p>89 We can regard this performance as the new baseline that benefited from the fuzzy lexical matching capabilities that we have added, as well as the broader set of surface forms and redirects from the current Wikipedia dump. [sent-320, score-0.142]
</p><p>90 In the second run,  RI, the complete relational inference described in this paper, scored 4. [sent-321, score-0.267]
</p><p>91 This shows the robustness of our methods as well as the general importance of understanding textual relations in the task of Entity Linking and Wikification. [sent-326, score-0.243]
</p><p>92 Later, various global statistical approaches were proposed to emphasize different coherence measures between the titles of the disambiguated mentions in the same doc1795  ument (Cucerzan, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008; Ratinov et al. [sent-328, score-0.335]
</p><p>93 We have demonstrated that, by incorporating textual relations and semantic knowledge as linguistic constraints in an inference framework, it is possible to significantly improve Wikification performance. [sent-331, score-0.285]
</p><p>94 Our system features high modularity since the relations are considered only at inference time; consequently, we can use any underlying Wikification system as long as it outputs a distribution of title candidates for each mention. [sent-334, score-0.488]
</p><p>95 One possibility for future work is to supply this framework with a richer set of relations from the text, such as verbal relations. [sent-335, score-0.128]
</p><p>96 It will also be inter-  esting to incorporate high-level typed relations and relax the relation arguments to be general concepts rather than only named entities. [sent-336, score-0.369]

<p>Author: Xiao Cheng ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Wikification, commonly referred to as Disambiguation to Wikipedia (D2W), is the task of identifying concepts and entities in text and disambiguating them into the most specific corresponding Wikipedia pages. Previous approaches to D2W focused on the use of local and global statistics over the given text, Wikipedia articles and its link structures, to evaluate context compatibility among a list of probable candidates. However, these methods fail (often, embarrassingly), when some level of text understanding is needed to support Wikification. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to Wikification by incorporating, along with statistical methods, richer relational analysis of the text. We provide an extensible, efficient and modular Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of Wikification that incorporates the entity-relation inference problem, and show that the ability to identify relations in text helps both candi- date generation and ranking Wikipedia titles considerably.

Recent collective disambiguation methods enforce coherence among contextual decisions at the cost of non-trivial inference processes. We propose a fast collective disambiguation approach based on stacking. First, we train a local predictor g0 with learning to rank as base learner, to generate initial ranking list of candidates. Second, top k candidates of related instances are searched for constructing expressive global coherence features. A global predictor g1 is trained in the augmented feature space and stacking is employed to tackle the train/test mismatch problem. The proposed method is fast and easy to implement.

<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Classical coreference systems encode various syntactic, discourse, and semantic phenomena explicitly, using heterogenous features computed from hand-crafted heuristics. In contrast, we present a state-of-the-art coreference system that captures such phenomena implicitly, with a small number of homogeneous feature templates examining shallow properties of mentions. Surprisingly, our features are actually more effective than the corresponding hand-engineered ones at modeling these key linguistic phenomena, allowing us to win “easy victories” without crafted heuristics. These features are successful on syntax and discourse; however, they do not model semantic compatibility well, nor do we see gains from experiments with shallow semantic features from the literature, suggesting that this approach to semantics is an “uphill battle.” Nonetheless, our final system1 outperforms the Stanford system (Lee et al. (201 1), the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task) by 3.5% absolute on the CoNLL metric and outperforms the IMS system (Bj o¨rkelund and Farkas (2012), the best publicly available English coreference system) by 1.9% absolute.</p><p>4 0.19401069 <a title="160-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Coreference_Resolution_and_Named-Entity_Linking_with_Multi-Pass_Sieves.html">112 emnlp-2013-Joint Coreference Resolution and Named-Entity Linking with Multi-Pass Sieves</a></p>
<p>Author: Hannaneh Hajishirzi ; Leila Zilles ; Daniel S. Weld ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Many errors in coreference resolution come from semantic mismatches due to inadequate world knowledge. Errors in named-entity linking (NEL), on the other hand, are often caused by superficial modeling of entity context. This paper demonstrates that these two tasks are complementary. We introduce NECO, a new model for named entity linking and coreference resolution, which solves both problems jointly, reducing the errors made on each. NECO extends the Stanford deterministic coreference system by automatically linking mentions to Wikipedia and introducing new NEL-informed mention-merging sieves. Linking improves mention-detection and enables new semantic attributes to be incorporated from Freebase, while coreference provides better context modeling by propagating named-entity links within mention clusters. Experiments show consistent improve- ments across a number of datasets and experimental conditions, including over 11% reduction in MUC coreference error and nearly 21% reduction in F1 NEL error on ACE 2004 newswire data.</p><p>5 0.18865259 <a title="160-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Combining_Generative_and_Discriminative_Model_Scores_for_Distant_Supervision.html">49 emnlp-2013-Combining Generative and Discriminative Model Scores for Distant Supervision</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiao Cheng ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Wikification, commonly referred to as Disambiguation to Wikipedia (D2W), is the task of identifying concepts and entities in text and disambiguating them into the most specific corresponding Wikipedia pages. Previous approaches to D2W focused on the use of local and global statistics over the given text, Wikipedia articles and its link structures, to evaluate context compatibility among a list of probable candidates. However, these methods fail (often, embarrassingly), when some level of text understanding is needed to support Wikification. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to Wikification by incorporating, along with statistical methods, richer relational analysis of the text. We provide an extensible, efficient and modular Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of Wikification that incorporates the entity-relation inference problem, and show that the ability to identify relations in text helps both candi- date generation and ranking Wikipedia titles considerably. Our results show significant improvements in both Wikification and the TAC Entity Linking task.</p><p>2 0.77313471 <a title="160-lsi-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Collective_Entity_Linking_with_Stacking.html">69 emnlp-2013-Efficient Collective Entity Linking with Stacking</a></p>

We introduce an unsupervised technique for identifying pseudepigrapha. The idea is to identify textual outliers in a corpus based on the pairwise similarities of all documents in the corpus. The crucial point is that document similarity not be measured in any of the standard ways but rather be based on the output of a recently introduced algorithm for authorship verification. The proposed method strongly outperforms existing techniques in systematic experiments on a blog corpus. 1</p><p>3 0.72826183 <a title="160-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Collective_Entity_Linking_with_Stacking.html">69 emnlp-2013-Efficient Collective Entity Linking with Stacking</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>5 0.59947002 <a title="160-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Bootstrapping_of_Corpus_Annotations_and_Entity_Types.html">110 emnlp-2013-Joint Bootstrapping of Corpus Annotations and Entity Types</a></p>

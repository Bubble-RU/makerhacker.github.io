<p>Author: Zhengyan He ; Shujie Liu ; Yang Song ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Houfeng Wang</p><p>Abstract: Entity disambiguation works by linking ambiguous mentions in text to their corresponding real-world entities in knowledge base. Recent collective disambiguation methods enforce coherence among contextual decisions at the cost of non-trivial inference processes. We propose a fast collective disambiguation approach based on stacking. First, we train a local predictor g0 with learning to rank as base learner, to generate initial ranking list of candidates. Second, top k candidates of related instances are searched for constructing expressive global coherence features. A global predictor g1 is trained in the augmented feature space and stacking is employed to tackle the train/test mismatch problem. The proposed method is fast and easy to implement. Experiments show its effectiveness over various algorithms on several public datasets. By learning a rich semantic relatedness measure be- . tween entity categories and context document, performance is further improved.</p><p>3 0.20070274 <a title="160-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Easy_Victories_and_Uphill_Battles_in_Coreference_Resolution.html">67 emnlp-2013-Easy Victories and Uphill Battles in Coreference Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Classical coreference systems encode various syntactic, discourse, and semantic phenomena explicitly, using heterogenous features computed from hand-crafted heuristics. In contrast, we present a state-of-the-art coreference system that captures such phenomena implicitly, with a small number of homogeneous feature templates examining shallow properties of mentions. Surprisingly, our features are actually more effective than the corresponding hand-engineered ones at modeling these key linguistic phenomena, allowing us to win “easy victories” without crafted heuristics. These features are successful on syntax and discourse; however, they do not model semantic compatibility well, nor do we see gains from experiments with shallow semantic features from the literature, suggesting that this approach to semantics is an “uphill battle.” Nonetheless, our final system1 outperforms the Stanford system (Lee et al. (201 1), the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task) by 3.5% absolute on the CoNLL metric and outperforms the IMS system (Bj o¨rkelund and Farkas (2012), the best publicly available English coreference system) by 1.9% absolute.</p><p>4 0.19781063 <a title="160-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Constrained_Latent_Variable_Model_for_Coreference_Resolution.html">1 emnlp-2013-A Constrained Latent Variable Model for Coreference Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai-Wei Chang ; Rajhans Samdani ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Coreference resolution is a well known clustering task in Natural Language Processing. In this paper, we describe the Latent Left Linking model (L3M), a novel, principled, and linguistically motivated latent structured prediction approach to coreference resolution. We show that L3M admits efficient inference and can be augmented with knowledge-based constraints; we also present a fast stochastic gradient based learning. Experiments on ACE and Ontonotes data show that L3M and its constrained version, CL3M, are more accurate than several state-of-the-art approaches as well as some structured prediction models proposed in the literature.</p><p>5 0.19079623 <a title="160-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Coreference_Resolution_and_Named-Entity_Linking_with_Multi-Pass_Sieves.html">112 emnlp-2013-Joint Coreference Resolution and Named-Entity Linking with Multi-Pass Sieves</a></p>
<p>Author: Hannaneh Hajishirzi ; Leila Zilles ; Daniel S.

Errors in named-entity linking (NEL), on the other hand, are often caused by superficial modeling of entity context. This paper demonstrates that these two tasks are complementary. We introduce NECO, a new model for named entity linking and coreference resolution, which solves both problems jointly, reducing the errors made on each. NECO extends the Stanford deterministic coreference system by automatically linking mentions to Wikipedia and introducing new NEL-informed mention-merging sieves. Linking improves mention-detection and enables new semantic attributes to be incorporated from Freebase, while coreference provides better context modeling by propagating named-entity links within mention clusters. Experiments show consistent improve- ments across a number of datasets and experimental conditions, including over 11% reduction in MUC coreference error and nearly 21% reduction in F1 NEL error on ACE 2004 newswire data.</p><p>6 0.18206461 <a title="160-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Combining_Generative_and_Discriminative_Model_Scores_for_Distant_Supervision.html">49 emnlp-2013-Combining Generative and Discriminative Model Scores for Distant Supervision</a></p>

<p>Author: Hrushikesh Mohapatra ; Siddhanth Jain ; Soumen Chakrabarti</p><p>Abstract: Web search can be enhanced in powerful ways if token spans in Web text are annotated with disambiguated entities from large catalogs like Freebase. Entity annotators need to be trained on sample mention snippets. Wikipedia entities and annotated pages offer high-quality labeled data for training and evaluation. Unfortunately, Wikipedia features only one-ninth the number of entities as Freebase, and these are a highly biased sample of well-connected, frequently mentioned “head” entities. To bring hope to “tail” entities, we broaden our goal to a second task: assigning types to entities in Freebase but not Wikipedia. The two tasks are synergistic: knowing the types of unfamiliar entities helps disambiguate mentions, and words in mention contexts help assign types to entities. We present TMI, a bipartite graphical model for joint type-mention inference. TMI attempts no schema integration or entity resolution, but exploits the above-mentioned synergy. In experiments involving 780,000 people in Wikipedia, 2.3 million people in Freebase, 700 million Web pages, and over 20 professional editors, TMI shows considerable annotation accuracy improvement (e.g., 70%) compared to baselines (e.g., 46%), especially for “tail” and emerging entities. We also compare with Google’s recent annotations of the same corpus with Freebase entities, and report considerable improvements within the people domain.</p><p>5 0.68342125 <a title="160-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Combining_Generative_and_Discriminative_Model_Scores_for_Distant_Supervision.html">49 emnlp-2013-Combining Generative and Discriminative Model Scores for Distant Supervision</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Roth ; Dietrich Klakow</p><p>Abstract: Distant supervision is a scheme to generate noisy training data for relation extraction by aligning entities of a knowledge base with text. In this work we combine the output of a discriminative at-least-one learner with that of a generative hierarchical topic model to reduce the noise in distant supervision data. The combination significantly increases the ranking quality of extracted facts and achieves state-of-the-art extraction performance in an end-to-end setting. A simple linear interpolation of the model scores performs better than a parameter-free scheme based on nondominated sorting.</p><p>6 0.65618271 <a title="160-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Multiple_Sources_for_Open-Domain_Hypernym_Discovery.html">79 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Multiple Sources for Open-Domain Hypernym Discovery</a></p>

<p>Author: Tao Ge ; Baobao Chang ; Sujian Li ; Zhifang Sui</p><p>Abstract: Since many applications such as timeline summaries and temporal IR involving temporal analysis rely on document timestamps, the task of automatic dating of documents has been increasingly important. Instead of using feature-based methods as conventional models, our method attempts to date documents in a year level by exploiting relative temporal relations between documents and events, which are very effective for dating documents. Based on this intuition, we proposed an eventbased time label propagation model called confidence boosting in which time label information can be propagated between documents and events on a bipartite graph. The experiments show that our event-based propagation model can predict document timestamps in high accuracy and the model combined with a MaxEnt classifier outperforms the state-ofthe-art method for this task especially when the size of the training set is small.</p><p>3 0.77797067 <a title="160-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Regularized_Minimum_Error_Rate_Training.html">159 emnlp-2013-Regularized Minimum Error Rate Training</a></p>

Second, it is commonly used on a noisy, non-convex loss function that becomes more difficult to optimize as the number of parameters increases. To address these issues, we study the addition of a regularization term to the MERT objective function. Since standard regularizers such as ‘2 are inapplicable to MERT due to the scale invariance of its objective function, we turn to two regularizers—‘0 and a modification of‘2— and present methods for efficiently integrating them during search. To improve search in large parameter spaces, we also present a new direction finding algorithm that uses the gradient of expected BLEU to orient MERT’s exact line searches. Experiments with up to 3600 features show that these extensions of MERT yield results comparable to PRO, a learner often used with large feature sets.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.76775253 <a title="160-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Relational_Inference_for_Wikification.html">160 emnlp-2013-Relational Inference for Wikification</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao Cheng ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Wikification, commonly referred to as Disambiguation to Wikipedia (D2W), is the task of identifying concepts and entities in text and disambiguating them into the most specific corresponding Wikipedia pages. Previous approaches to D2W focused on the use of local and global statistics over the given text, Wikipedia articles and its link structures, to evaluate context compatibility among a list of probable candidates. However, these methods fail (often, embarrassingly), when some level of text understanding is needed to support Wikification. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to Wikification by incorporating, along with statistical methods, richer relational analysis of the text. We provide an extensible, efficient and modular Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of Wikification that incorporates the entity-relation inference problem, and show that the ability to identify relations in text helps both candi- date generation and ranking Wikipedia titles considerably. Our results show significant improvements in both Wikification and the TAC Entity Linking task.</p><p>5 0.71480972 <a title="160-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Russian_Stress_Prediction_using_Maximum_Entropy_Ranking.html">162 emnlp-2013-Russian Stress Prediction using Maximum Entropy Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Keith Hall ; Richard Sproat</p><p>Abstract: We explore a model of stress prediction in Russian using a combination of local contextual features and linguisticallymotivated features associated with the word’s stem and suffix. We frame this as a ranking problem, where the objective is to rank the pronunciation with the correct stress above those with incorrect stress. We train our models using a simple Maximum Entropy ranking framework allowing for efficient prediction. An empirical evaluation shows that a model combining the local contextual features and the linguistically-motivated non-local features performs best in identifying both primary and secondary stress. 1</p><p>6 0.60381478 <a title="160-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Biological_Processes_with_Global_Constraints.html">118 emnlp-2013-Learning Biological Processes with Global Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Tengfei Ma ; Hiroshi Nakagawa</p><p>Abstract: Document summarization is an important task in the area of natural language processing, which aims to extract the most important information from a single document or a cluster of documents. In various summarization tasks, the summary length is manually defined. However, how to find the proper summary length is quite a problem; and keeping all summaries restricted to the same length is not always a good choice. It is obviously improper to generate summaries with the same length for two clusters of documents which contain quite different quantity of information. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model for multidocument summarization in order to automatically determine the proper lengths of summaries. Assuming that an original document can be reconstructed from its summary, we describe the ”reconstruction” by a Bayesian framework which selects sentences to form a good summary. Experimental results on DUC2004 data sets and some expanded data demonstrate the good quality of our summaries and the rationality of the length determination.</p><p>3 0.095112346 <a title="48-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Gender_Inference_of_Twitter_Users_in_Non-English_Contexts.html">89 emnlp-2013-Gender Inference of Twitter Users in Non-English Contexts</a></p>
<p>Author: Morgane Ciot ; Morgan Sonderegger ; Derek Ruths</p><p>Abstract: While much work has considered the problem of latent attribute inference for users of social media such as Twitter, little has been done on non-English-based content and users. Here, we conduct the first assessment of latent attribute inference in languages beyond English, focusing on gender inference. We find that the gender inference problem in quite diverse languages can be addressed using existing machinery. Further, accuracy gains can be made by taking language-specific features into account. We identify languages with complex orthography, such as Japanese, as difficult for existing methods, suggesting a valuable direction for future research.</p><p>4 0.068050198 <a title="48-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Log-Linear_Model_for_Unsupervised_Text_Normalization.html">9 emnlp-2013-A Log-Linear Model for Unsupervised Text Normalization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Yang ; Jacob Eisenstein</p><p>Abstract: We present a unified unsupervised statistical model for text normalization. The relationship between standard and non-standard tokens is characterized by a log-linear model, permitting arbitrary features. The weights of these features are trained in a maximumlikelihood framework, employing a novel sequential Monte Carlo training algorithm to overcome the large label space, which would be impractical for traditional dynamic programming solutions. This model is implemented in a normalization system called UNLOL, which achieves the best known results on two normalization datasets, outperforming more complex systems. We use the output of UNLOL to automatically normalize a large corpus of social media text, revealing a set of coherent orthographic styles that underlie online language variation.</p><p>5 0.067494899 <a title="48-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Predicting_the_Presence_of_Discourse_Connectives.html">152 emnlp-2013-Predicting the Presence of Discourse Connectives</a></p>
<p>Author: Gary Patterson ; Andrew Kehler</p><p>Abstract: We present a classification model that predicts the presence or omission of a lexical connective between two clauses, based upon linguistic features of the clauses and the type of discourse relation holding between them. The model is trained on a set of high frequency relations extracted from the Penn Discourse Treebank and achieves an accuracy of 86.6%. Analysis of the results reveals that the most informative features relate to the discourse dependencies between sequences of coherence relations in the text. We also present results of an experiment that provides insight into the nature and difficulty of the task.</p><p>6 0.065518685 <a title="48-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Hierarchical_Entity-Based_Approach_to_Structuralize_User_Generated_Content_in_Social_Media%3A_A_Case_of_Yahoo%21_Answers.html">7 emnlp-2013-A Hierarchical Entity-Based Approach to Structuralize User Generated Content in Social Media: A Case of Yahoo!

<p>Author: Hongbo Chen ; Ben He</p><p>Abstract: Previous approaches for automated essay scoring (AES) learn a rating model by minimizing either the classification, regression, or pairwise classification loss, depending on the learning algorithm used. In this paper, we argue that the current AES systems can be further improved by taking into account the agreement between human and machine raters. To this end, we propose a rankbased approach that utilizes listwise learning to rank algorithms for learning a rating model, where the agreement between the human and machine raters is directly incorporated into the loss function. Various linguistic and statistical features are utilized to facilitate the learning algorithms. Experiments on the publicly available English essay dataset, Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP), show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, and achieves performance comparable to professional human raters, which suggests the effectiveness of our proposed method for automated essay scoring.</p><p>5 0.51308078 <a title="48-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Well-Argued_Recommendation%3A_Adaptive_Models_Based_on_Words_in_Recommender_Systems.html">200 emnlp-2013-Well-Argued Recommendation: Adaptive Models Based on Words in Recommender Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Julien Gaillard ; Marc El-Beze ; Eitan Altman ; Emmanuel Ethis</p><p>Abstract: Recommendation systems (RS) take advantage ofproducts and users information in order to propose items to consumers. Collaborative, content-based and a few hybrid RS have been developed in the past. In contrast, we propose a new domain-independent semantic RS. By providing textually well-argued recommendations, we aim to give more responsibility to the end user in his decision. The system includes a new similarity measure keeping up both the accuracy of rating predictions and coverage. We propose an innovative way to apply a fast adaptation scheme at a semantic level, providing recommendations and arguments in phase with the very recent past. We have performed several experiments on films data, providing textually well-argued recommendations.</p><p>6 0.4470138 <a title="48-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Gender_Inference_of_Twitter_Users_in_Non-English_Contexts.html">89 emnlp-2013-Gender Inference of Twitter Users in Non-English Contexts</a></p>

<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Eunsol Choi ; Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: We consider the challenge of learning semantic parsers that scale to large, open-domain problems, such as question answering with Freebase. In such settings, the sentences cover a wide variety of topics and include many phrases whose meaning is difficult to represent in a fixed target ontology. For example, even simple phrases such as ‘daughter’ and ‘number of people living in’ cannot be directly represented in Freebase, whose ontology instead encodes facts about gender, parenthood, and population. In this paper, we introduce a new semantic parsing approach that learns to resolve such ontological mismatches. The parser is learned from question-answer pairs, uses a probabilistic CCG to build linguistically motivated logicalform meaning representations, and includes an ontology matching model that adapts the output logical forms for each target ontology. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark semantic parsing datasets, including a nine point accuracy improvement on a recent Freebase QA corpus.</p><p>3 0.72078878 <a title="48-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Open_Domain_Targeted_Sentiment.html">143 emnlp-2013-Open Domain Targeted Sentiment</a></p>
<p>Author: Margaret Mitchell ; Jacqui Aguilar ; Theresa Wilson ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to sentiment analysis for a low resource setting. The intuition behind this work is that sentiment expressed towards an entity, targeted sentiment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment expressed across the entity. This representation allows us to model sentiment detection as a sequence tagging problem, jointly discovering people and organizations along with whether there is sentiment directed towards them. We compare performance in both Spanish and English on microblog data, using only a sentiment lexicon as an external resource. By leveraging linguisticallyinformed features within conditional random fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empirical risk, our best models in Spanish significantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach around 90% accuracy on the combined task of named entity recognition and sentiment prediction. Our models in English, trained on a much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically significant against their baselines.</p><p>4 0.72055221 <a title="48-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Learning_Topics_and_Positions_from_Debatepedia.html">121 emnlp-2013-Learning Topics and Positions from Debatepedia</a></p>
<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Minghui Qiu ; Yanchuan Sim ; Jing Jiang ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We explore Debatepedia, a communityauthored encyclopedia of sociopolitical debates, as evidence for inferring a lowdimensional, human-interpretable representation in the domain of issues and positions. We introduce a generative model positing latent topics and cross-cutting positions that gives special treatment to person mentions and opinion words. We evaluate the resulting representation’s usefulness in attaching opinionated documents to arguments and its consistency with human judgments about positions.</p><p>5 0.7175194 <a title="48-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Cross-Lingual_Discriminative_Learning_of_Sequence_Models_with_Posterior_Regularization.html">53 emnlp-2013-Cross-Lingual Discriminative Learning of Sequence Models with Posterior Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev ; Dipanjan Das</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for cross-lingual transfer of sequence information from a resource-rich source language to a resourceimpoverished target language that incorporates soft constraints via posterior regularization. To this end, we use automatically word aligned bitext between the source and target language pair, and learn a discriminative conditional random field model on the target side. Our posterior regularization constraints are derived from simple intuitions about the task at hand and from cross-lingual alignment information. We show improvements over strong baselines for two tasks: part-of-speech tagging and namedentity segmentation.</p><p>6 0.70208019 <a title="48-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Coreference_Resolution_and_Named-Entity_Linking_with_Multi-Pass_Sieves.html">112 emnlp-2013-Joint Coreference Resolution and Named-Entity Linking with Multi-Pass Sieves</a></p>

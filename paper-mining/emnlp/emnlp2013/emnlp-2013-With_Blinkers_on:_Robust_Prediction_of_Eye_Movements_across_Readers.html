<p>Author: Mikhail Ageev ; Dmitry Lagun ; Eugene Agichtein</p><p>Abstract: Passage retrieval is a crucial first step of automatic Question Answering (QA). While existing passage retrieval algorithms are effective at selecting document passages most similar to the question, or those that contain the expected answer types, they do not take into account which parts of the document the searchers actually found useful. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful attempt to incorporate searcher examination data into passage retrieval for question answering. Specifically, we exploit detailed examination data, such as mouse cursor movements and scrolling, to infer the parts of the document the searcher found interesting, and then incorporate this signal into passage retrieval for QA. Our extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our method significantly improves passage retrieval, compared to using textual features alone. As an additional contribution, we make available to the research community the code and the search behavior data used in this study, with the hope of encouraging further research in this area.</p><p>3 0.056858081 <a title="203-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Online_Learning_for_Inexact_Hypergraph_Search.html">141 emnlp-2013-Online Learning for Inexact Hypergraph Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Zhang ; Liang Huang ; Kai Zhao ; Ryan McDonald</p><p>Abstract: Online learning algorithms like the perceptron are widely used for structured prediction tasks. For sequential search problems, like left-to-right tagging and parsing, beam search has been successfully combined with perceptron variants that accommodate search errors (Collins and Roark, 2004; Huang et al., 2012). However, perceptron training with inexact search is less studied for bottom-up parsing and, more generally, inference over hypergraphs. In this paper, we generalize the violation-fixing perceptron of Huang et al. (2012) to hypergraphs and apply it to the cube-pruning parser of Zhang and McDonald (2012). This results in the highest reported scores on WSJ evaluation set (UAS 93.50% and LAS 92.41% respectively) without the aid of additional resources.</p><p>4 0.055857606 <a title="203-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Inducing_Document_Plans_for_Concept-to-Text_Generation.html">106 emnlp-2013-Inducing Document Plans for Concept-to-Text Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Konstas ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In a language generation system, a content planner selects which elements must be included in the output text and the ordering between them. Recent empirical approaches perform content selection without any ordering and have thus no means to ensure that the output is coherent. In this paper we focus on the problem of generating text from a database and present a trainable end-to-end generation system that includes both content selection and ordering. Content plans are represented intuitively by a set of grammar rules that operate on the document level and are acquired automatically from training data. We develop two approaches: the first one is inspired from Rhetorical Structure Theory and represents the document as a tree of discourse relations between database records; the second one requires little linguistic sophistication and uses tree structures to represent global patterns of database record sequences within a document. Experimental evaluation on two domains yields considerable improvements over the state of the art for both approaches.</p><p>5 0.052753497 <a title="203-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Success_with_Style%3A_Using_Writing_Style_to_Predict_the_Success_of_Novels.html">178 emnlp-2013-Success with Style: Using Writing Style to Predict the Success of Novels</a></p>

<p>Author: Heng Yu ; Liang Huang ; Haitao Mi ; Kai Zhao</p><p>Abstract: While large-scale discriminative training has triumphed in many NLP problems, its definite success on machine translation has been largely elusive. Most recent efforts along this line are not scalable (training on the small dev set with features from top ∼100 most frequent wt woridths) f eaantdu overly complicated. oWste f iren-stead present a very simple yet theoretically motivated approach by extending the recent framework of “violation-fixing perceptron”, using forced decoding to compute the target derivations. Extensive phrase-based translation experiments on both Chinese-to-English and Spanish-to-English tasks show substantial gains in BLEU by up to +2.3/+2.0 on dev/test over MERT, thanks to 20M+ sparse features. This is the first successful effort of large-scale online discriminative training for MT. 1Introduction Large-scale discriminative training has witnessed great success in many NLP problems such as parsing (McDonald et al., 2005) and tagging (Collins, 2002), but not yet for machine translation (MT) despite numerous recent efforts. Due to scalability issues, most of these recent methods can only train on a small dev set of about a thousand sentences rather than on the full training set, and only with 2,000–10,000 rather “dense-like” features (either unlexicalized or only considering highest-frequency words), as in MIRA (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008; Chiang, 2012), PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011), and RAMP (Gimpel and Smith, 2012). However, it is well-known that the most important features for NLP are lexicalized, most of which can not ∗ Work done while visiting City University of New York. Corresponding author. † 1112 be seen on a small dataset. Furthermore, these methods often involve complicated loss functions and intricate choices of the “target” derivations to update towards or against (e.g. k-best/forest oracles, or hope/fear derivations), and are thus hard to replicate. As a result, the classical method of MERT (Och, 2003) remains the default training algorithm for MT even though it can only tune a handful of dense features. See also Section 6 for other related work. As a notable exception, Liang et al. (2006) do train a structured perceptron model on the training data with sparse features, but fail to outperform MERT. We argue this is because structured perceptron, like many structured learning algorithms such as CRF and MIRA, assumes exact search, and search errors inevitably break theoretical properties such as convergence (Huang et al., 2012). Empirically, it is now well accepted that standard perceptron performs poorly when search error is severe (Collins and Roark, 2004; Zhang et al., 2013). To address the search error problem we propose a very simple approach based on the recent framework of “violation-fixing perceptron” (Huang et al., 2012) which is designed specifically for inexact search, with a theoretical convergence guarantee and excellent empirical performance on beam search parsing and tagging. The basic idea is to update when search error happens, rather than at the end of the search. To adapt it to MT, we extend this framework to handle latent variables corresponding to the hidden derivations. We update towards “gold-standard” derivations computed by forced decoding so that each derivation leads to the exact reference translation. Forced decoding is also used as a way of data selection, since those reachable sentence pairs are generally more literal and of higher quality, which the training should focus on. When the reachable subset is small for some language pairs, we augment Proce Sdeiantgtlse o,f W thaesh 2i0n1gt3o nC,o UnSfeAre,n 1c8e- o2n1 E Omctpoibriecra 2l0 M13et.h ?oc d2s0 i1n3 N Aastusorcaila Ltiaon g fuoarg Ceo Pmrpoucetastsi on ga,l p Laignegsu 1is1t1ic2s–1 23, it by including reachable prefix-pairs when the full sentence pair is not. We make the following contributions: 1. Our work is the first successful effort to scale online structured learning to a large portion of the training data (as opposed to the dev set). 2. Our work is the first to use a principled learning method customized for inexact search which updates on partial derivations rather than full ones in order to fix search errors. We adapt it to MT using latent variables for derivations. 3. Contrary to the common wisdom, we show that simply updating towards the exact reference translation is helpful, which is much simpler than k-best/forest oracles or loss-augmented (e.g. hope/fear) derivations, avoiding sentencelevel BLEU scores or other loss functions. 4. We present a convincing analysis that it is the search errors and standard perceptron’s inability to deal with them that prevent previous work, esp. Liang et al. (2006), from succeeding. 5. Scaling to the training data enables us to engineer a very rich feature set of sparse, lexicalized, and non-local features, and we propose various ways to alleviate overfitting. For simplicity and efficiency reasons, in this paper we use phrase-based translation, but our method has the potential to be applicable to other translation paradigms. Extensive experiments on both Chineseto-English and Spanish-to-English tasks show statistically significant gains in BLEU by up to +2.3/+2.0 on dev/test over MERT, and up to +1.5/+1.5 over PRO, thanks to 20M+ sparse features. 2 Phrase-Based MT and Forced Decoding We first review the basic phrase-based decoding algorithm (Koehn, 2004), which will be adapted for forced decoding. 2.1 Background: Phrase-based Decoding We will use the following running example from Chinese to English from Mi et al.

B `ush´ ı y uˇ Sh¯ al´ ong j ˇux ´ıng le hu` ıt´ an Bush with Sharon hold -ed meeting ‘Bush held a meeting with Sharon’ Phrase-based decoders generate partial targetlanguage outputs in left-to-right order in the form of hypotheses (or states) (Koehn, 2004). Each hypothesis has a coverage vector capturing the sourcelanguage words translated so far, and can be extended into a longer hypothesis by a phrase-pair translating an uncovered segment. For example, the following is one possible derivation: (• 3(• •() • :1( •s063),:“(Bs)u2s:,h)“(hBs:e1ul(d,s0“ht,aB“hleuk”ls) hdw”t)ailhkrsS1”h)aro2n”)r3 where a • in the coverage vector indicates the source wwoherdre a at •th i ns position aisg e“ vcoecvteorred in”d iacnadte ws thheer seo euarcche si is the score of each state, each adding the rule score and the distortion cost (dc) to the score of the previous state. To compute the distortion cost we also need to maintain the ending position of the last phrase (e.g., the 3 and 6 in the coverage vectors). In phrase-based translation there is also a distortionlimit which prohibits long-distance reorderings. The above states are called −LM states since they do Tnhoet ainbovovleve st language mlleodd −el LcMos tsst.a eTso iandcde a beiygram model, we split each −LM state into a series ogrfa +mL mMo states; ee sapchli t+ eaLcMh −staLtMe h satsa ttehe in ftoor ma (v,a) where a is the last word of the hypothesis.

Our model expresses both token emission and state transition probabilities as log-linear functions of separate components corresponding to topics and speech acts (and their interactions). We apply this model to a dataset comprising annotated patient-physician visits and show that the proposed joint approach outperforms a baseline univariate model.</p><p>3 0.86661124 <a title="203-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Automatically_Determining_a_Proper_Length_for_Multi-Document_Summarization%3A_A_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Approach.html">36 emnlp-2013-Automatically Determining a Proper Length for Multi-Document Summarization: A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Tengfei Ma ; Hiroshi Nakagawa</p><p>Abstract: Document summarization is an important task in the area of natural language processing, which aims to extract the most important information from a single document or a cluster of documents. In various summarization tasks, the summary length is manually defined. However, how to find the proper summary length is quite a problem; and keeping all summaries restricted to the same length is not always a good choice. It is obviously improper to generate summaries with the same length for two clusters of documents which contain quite different quantity of information. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model for multidocument summarization in order to automatically determine the proper lengths of summaries. Assuming that an original document can be reconstructed from its summary, we describe the ”reconstruction” by a Bayesian framework which selects sentences to form a good summary. Experimental results on DUC2004 data sets and some expanded data demonstrate the good quality of our summaries and the rationality of the length determination.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.8555671 <a title="203-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-With_Blinkers_on%3A_Robust_Prediction_of_Eye_Movements_across_Readers.html">203 emnlp-2013-With Blinkers on: Robust Prediction of Eye Movements across Readers</a></p>
<p>Author: Franz Matthies ; Anders Sgaard</p><p>Abstract: Nilsson and Nivre (2009) introduced a treebased model of persons’ eye movements in reading. The individual variation between readers reportedly made application across readers impossible. While a tree-based model seems plausible for eye movements, we show that competitive results can be obtained with a linear CRF model. Increasing the inductive bias also makes learning across readers possible. In fact we observe next-to-no performance drop when evaluating models trained on gaze records of multiple readers on new readers.</p><p>5 0.57163364 <a title="203-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Efficient_Left-to-Right_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation_with_Improved_Reordering.html">71 emnlp-2013-Efficient Left-to-Right Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation with Improved Reordering</a></p>
<p>Author: Maryam Siahbani ; Baskaran Sankaran ; Anoop Sarkar</p><p>Abstract: Left-to-right (LR) decoding (Watanabe et al., 2006b) is a promising decoding algorithm for hierarchical phrase-based translation (Hiero). It generates the target sentence by extending the hypotheses only on the right edge. LR decoding has complexity O(n2b) for input of n words and beam size b, compared to O(n3) for the CKY algorithm. It requires a single language model (LM) history for each target hypothesis rather than two LM histories per hypothesis as in CKY. In this paper we present an augmented LR decoding algorithm that builds on the original algorithm in (Watanabe et al., 2006b). Unlike that algorithm, using experiments over multiple language pairs we show two new results: our LR decoding algorithm provides demonstrably more efficient decoding than CKY Hiero, four times faster; and by introducing new distortion and reordering features for LR decoding, it maintains the same translation quality (as in BLEU scores) ob- tained phrase-based and CKY Hiero with the same translation model.</p><p>6 0.52172363 <a title="203-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Improvements_to_the_Bayesian_Topic_N-Gram_Models.html">100 emnlp-2013-Improvements to the Bayesian Topic N-Gram Models</a></p>

We advance the previous study of the Bayesian topic language model by Wallach (2006) in two directions: one, investigating new priors to alleviate the sparseness problem caused by dividing all ngrams into exclusive topics, and two, developing a novel Gibbs sampler that enables moving multiple n-grams across different documents to another topic. Our blocked sampler can efficiently search for higher probability space even with higher order n-grams. In terms of modeling assumption, we found it is effective to assign a topic to only some parts of a document.</p><p>Reference: <a title="emnlp-2013-100-reference" href="../emnlp2013_reference/emnlp-2013-Improvements_to_the_Bayesian_Topic_N-Gram_Models_reference.html">text</a></p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Our blocked sampler can efficiently search for higher probability space even with higher order n-grams.

</p><p>6 Wallach (2006) is one such model, which generate each word based on local context and global topic information to capture 1180 the difference of lexical usage among different topics. [sent-21, score-0.338]
</p><p>7 When the number of topics is K and vocabulary size is V , n-gram topic model has O(KVn) parameters, which grow exponentially to n, making the local minima problem even more severe. [sent-27, score-0.415]
</p><p>8 Our sampler resolves this problem by moving many customers in the hierarchical Chinese restau-  rant process at a time. [sent-28, score-0.555]
</p><p>9 2  Basic Models  All models presented in this paper are based on the Bayesian n-gram language model, the hierarchical Pitman-Yor process language model (HPYLM). [sent-33, score-0.158]
</p><p>10 In the following, we first introduce the HPYLM, and then discuss the topic model extension of Wallach (2006) with HPYLM. [sent-34, score-0.318]
</p><p>11 The generative story starts with the unigram word distribution Gφ, which is a V -dimensional multinomial where Gφ(w) represents the probability of word w. [sent-39, score-0.153]
</p><p>12 The model first generates this distribution from the PYP as Gφ ∼ PYP(a, b, G0), where G0 is a V -dimensional un∼iform distribution (G0(u) = V1; ∀u ∈ W) and acts as a prior for Gφ and a, b are hyperparameters called discount and concentration, respectively. [sent-40, score-0.182]
</p><p>13 For example, two contexts “he is” and “she is”, which share the suffix “is”, are generated from the same (bigram) distribution Gis, so they would have similar word distributions. [sent-43, score-0.159]
</p><p>14 2 Wallach (2006) with HPYLM Wallach (2006) is a generative model for a document collection that combines the topic model with a Bayesian n-gram language model. [sent-52, score-0.364]
</p><p>15 , 2003) is the most basic topic model, which generates each word in a document based on a unigram word distribution defined by a topic allocated to that word. [sent-54, score-0.796]
</p><p>16 The bigram topic model of Wallach (2006) simply replaces this unigram word distribution (a multinomial) for each topic with a bigram word distribution 1. [sent-55, score-0.836]
</p><p>17 In other words, ordinary LDA generates word conditioning only on the latent topic, whereas the bigram topic model generates conditioning on both the latent topic and the previous word, as in the bigram language model. [sent-56, score-0.844]
</p><p>18 Extending this model with a higher order n-gram is trivial; all we have to do is to replace the bigram language model for each topic with an ngram language model. [sent-57, score-0.332]
</p><p>19 The formal description of the generative story of this n-gram topic model is as follows. [sent-58, score-0.326]

</p><p>25 Roughly speaking, when the number of topics is K and the number of all n-grams in the training corpus is N, a language model of topic k, Ghk is learned using only about O(N/K) instances of the n-grams assigned the topic k, making each Ghk much sparser and unreliable distribution. [sent-72, score-0.657]
</p><p>26 In one model, the HIERARCHICAL model, Gh0 is used as a prior for all other n-gram models, where Gh0 exploits global statistics across all topics {Gkh}. [sent-76, score-0.152]

</p><p>31 This shows us that λ determines the back-off behavior: which probability we should take into account: the shorter context of the same topic Ghk0 or the full context of the global model Gh0. [sent-100, score-0.338]
</p><p>32 We encode this assumption by placing hierarchical Beta distributions on the suffix tree across all topics: λh  ∼  Beta(γλh0, γ(1  −  λh0)) = DP(γ, λh0),  (5)  where DP is the hierarchical Dirichlet process (Teh et al. [sent-108, score-0.327]
</p><p>33 Having generated the topic component of the model, the corpus generating process is the same as the previous model because we only change the generating process of Ghk for k = 1, · · · , K. [sent-111, score-0.349]
</p><p>34 In this model, relationship of Gh0 to the other {Gkh} is flat, not hierarchical: Gh0 is a special topic etrh a{Gt can generate a word. [sent-116, score-0.281]

</p><p>41 We present two different types of sampler: a token-based sampler and a table-based sampler. [sent-136, score-0.215]
</p><p>42 1 Token-based Sampler The token-based sampler is almost identical to the collapsed sampler of the LDA (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004). [sent-140, score-0.471]
</p><p>43 Given the sampled topic zji, we update the language model of topic zji, by adding 1184 customer wji to the restaurant specified by zji and context hji. [sent-142, score-1.252]

[sent-144, score-0.235]
</p><p>45 We need not assign a label to a new table, but rather we always add a customer to the restaurant of λh according to whether the sampled topic is 0 or not. [sent-147, score-0.553]
</p><p>46 2 Table-based Sampler One problem with the token-based sampler is that the seating arrangement of the internal restaurant would never be changed unless a new table is created (or an old table is removed) in its child restaurant. [sent-149, score-0.594]

</p><p>52 Move S to sampled topic, and∼ ad p(dz a |cSu,sStomer to the parent restaurant of the first selected table. [sent-159, score-0.211]
</p><p>53 We continue this process recursively until reaching the leaf nodes, obtaining a block of seating arrangement S. [sent-161, score-0.311]
</p><p>54 After calculating the conditional distribution, we sample new topic assignment for this block. [sent-162, score-0.281]
</p><p>55 Finally, we move this block to the sampled topic, which potentially changes the topic of many words across different documents, which are connected to customers in a block at leaf nodes (this connection is also arbitrary). [sent-163, score-0.605]

</p><p>58 For example, imagine a table in the restaurant of context “hidden” (depth is 2) and some topic, served “unit”. [sent-166, score-0.213]
</p><p>59 This table is connected to tables in its child restaurants corresponding to some 3-grams (e. [sent-167, score-0.202]
</p><p>60 , “of hidden unit” or “train hidden unit”), whereas similar n-grams, such as those of “of hidden units” or “train hidden units” might be gathered in another topic, but collecting these ngrams into the same topic might be difficult under  the token-based sampler. [sent-169, score-0.44]
</p><p>61 The table-based sampler moves those different n-grams having common suffixes jointly into another topic. [sent-170, score-0.215]
</p><p>62 Figure 3 shows a transition of state by the tablebased sampler and Algorithm 4. [sent-171, score-0.215]
</p><p>63 Because this connection cannot be preserved in common data structures for a restaurant described in Teh (2006a) or Blunsom et al. [sent-175, score-0.174]
</p><p>64 This is correct because customers in CRP are exchangerestaurant (Teh, 2006a), we can imagine that customers and tables in S have been added to the restaurants last. [sent-177, score-0.488]

[sent-185, score-0.435]
</p><p>69 HIERARCHICAL We skip tables on restaurants of k = 0, because these tables are all from other topics and we cannot construct a block. [sent-186, score-0.375]
</p><p>70 This problem is the same one addressed by Blunsom and Cohn (201 1), and we follow the same approximation in which, when we calculate the probability, we fractionally add tables and customers recursively. [sent-189, score-0.221]
</p><p>71 3 Inference of Hyperparameters We also place a prior on each hyperparameter and sample value from the posterior distribution for every iteration. [sent-191, score-0.166]

</p><p>85 For all other models, we ran 500 iterations of the Gibbs; HPYTMtoken is trained  only on the token-based sampler, while for other models, the table-based sampler is performed after the token-based sampler. [sent-259, score-0.215]

</p><p>89 The HIERARCHICAL must allocate some (not global) topics to every word in a document, so even the words to which the SWITCHING might allocate the global topic (mainly function words; see below) must be allocated to some other topics, causing a mismatch of allocations of topic.

We advance the previous study of the Bayesian topic language model by Wallach (2006) in two directions: one, investigating new priors to alleviate the sparseness problem caused by dividing all ngrams into exclusive topics, and two, developing a novel Gibbs sampler that enables moving multiple n-grams across different documents to another topic. Our blocked sampler can efficiently search for higher probability space even with higher order n-grams. In terms of modeling assumption, we found it is effective to assign a topic to only some parts of a document.</p><p>2 0.15288669 <a title="100-tfidf-2" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploiting_Domain_Knowledge_in_Aspect_Extraction.html">77 emnlp-2013-Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Aspect Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiyuan Chen ; Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu ; Meichun Hsu ; Malu Castellanos ; Riddhiman Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical models have been used for the task. However, such models without any domain knowledge often produce aspects that are not interpretable in applications. To tackle the issue, some knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which allow the user to input some prior domain knowledge to generate coherent aspects. However, existing knowledge-based topic models have several major shortcomings, e.g., little work has been done to incorporate the cannot-link type of knowledge or to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that MCLDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models markedly.</p><p>3 0.11107975 <a title="100-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Where_Not_to_Eat%3F_Improving_Public_Policy_by_Predicting_Hygiene_Inspections_Using_Online_Reviews.html">202 emnlp-2013-Where Not to Eat? Improving Public Policy by Predicting Hygiene Inspections Using Online Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Seok Kang ; Polina Kuznetsova ; Michael Luca ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: This paper offers an approach for governments to harness the information contained in social media in order to make public inspections and disclosure more efficient. As a case study, we turn to restaurant hygiene inspections which are done for restaurants throughout the United States and in most of the world and are a frequently cited example of public inspections and disclosure. We present the first empirical study that shows the viability of statistical models that learn the mapping between textual signals in restaurant reviews and the hygiene inspection records from the Department of Public Health. The learned model achieves over 82% accuracy in discriminating severe – offenders from places with no violation, and provides insights into salient cues in reviews that are indicative of the restaurant’s sanitary conditions. Our study suggests that public disclosure policy can be improved by mining public opinions from social media to target inspections and to provide alternative forms of disclosure to customers.</p><p>4 0.10861824 <a title="100-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Orthonormal_Explicit_Topic_Analysis_for_Cross-Lingual_Document_Matching.html">148 emnlp-2013-Orthonormal Explicit Topic Analysis for Cross-Lingual Document Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: John Philip McCrae ; Philipp Cimiano ; Roman Klinger</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modelling has applications in machine translation, word sense disambiguation and terminology alignment. Multilingual extensions of approaches based on latent (LSI), generative (LDA, PLSI) as well as explicit (ESA) topic modelling can induce an interlingual topic space allowing documents in different languages to be mapped into the same space and thus to be compared across languages. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines latent and explicit topic modelling approaches in the sense that it builds on a set of explicitly defined topics, but then computes latent relations between these. Thus, the method combines the benefits of both explicit and latent topic modelling approaches. We show that on a crosslingual mate retrieval task, our model significantly outperforms LDA, LSI, and ESA, as well as a baseline that translates every word in a document into the target language.</p><p>5 0.10438029 <a title="100-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Implicit_Feature_Detection_via_a_Constrained_Topic_Model_and_SVM.html">99 emnlp-2013-Implicit Feature Detection via a Constrained Topic Model and SVM</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Wang ; Hua Xu ; Xiaoqiu Huang</p><p>Abstract: Implicit feature detection, also known as implicit feature identification, is an essential aspect of feature-specific opinion mining but previous works have often ignored it. We think, based on the explicit sentences, several Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers can be established to do this task. Nevertheless, we believe it is possible to do better by using a constrained topic model instead of traditional attribute selection methods. Experiments show that this method outperforms the traditional attribute selection methods by a large margin and the detection task can be completed better.</p><p>6 0.100346 <a title="100-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Exploring_the_Utility_of_Joint_Morphological_and_Syntactic_Learning_from_Child-directed_Speech.html">83 emnlp-2013-Exploring the Utility of Joint Morphological and Syntactic Learning from Child-directed Speech</a></p>

<p>Author: James Foulds ; Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: When reviewing scientific literature, it would be useful to have automatic tools that identify the most influential scientific articles as well as how ideas propagate between articles. In this context, this paper introduces topical influence, a quantitative measure of the extent to which an article tends to spread its topics to the articles that cite it. Given the text of the articles and their citation graph, we show how to learn a probabilistic model to recover both the degree of topical influence of each article and the influence relationships between articles. Experimental results on corpora from two well-known computer science conferences are used to illustrate and validate the proposed approach.</p><p>5 0.56819546 <a title="100-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Implicit_Feature_Detection_via_a_Constrained_Topic_Model_and_SVM.html">99 emnlp-2013-Implicit Feature Detection via a Constrained Topic Model and SVM</a></p>

<p>Author: Matt Gardner ; Partha Pratim Talukdar ; Bryan Kisiel ; Tom Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: Automatically constructed Knowledge Bases (KBs) are often incomplete and there is a genuine need to improve their coverage. Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) is a recently proposed method which aims to improve KB coverage by performing inference directly over the KB graph. For the first time, we demonstrate that addition of edges labeled with latent features mined from a large dependency parsed corpus of 500 million Web documents can significantly outperform previous PRAbased approaches on the KB inference task. We present extensive experimental results validating this finding.

<p>Author: Jimmy Dubuisson ; Jean-Pierre Eckmann ; Christian Scheible ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: Studies of the graph of dictionary definitions (DD) (Picard et al., 2009; Levary et al., 2012) have revealed strong semantic coherence of local topological structures. The techniques used in these papers are simple and the main results are found by understanding the structure of cycles in the directed graph (where words point to definitions). Based on our earlier work (Levary et al., 2012), we study a different class of word definitions, namely those of the Free Association (FA) dataset (Nelson et al., 2004). These are responses by subjects to a cue word, which are then summarized by a directed, free association graph. We find that the structure of this network is quite different from both the Wordnet and the dictionary networks. This difference can be explained by the very nature of free association as compared to the more “logical” construction of dictionaries. It thus sheds some (quantitative) light on the psychology of free association. In NLP, semantic groups or clusters are interesting for various applications such as word sense disambiguation. The FA graph is tighter than the DD graph, because of the large number of triangles. This also makes drift of meaning quite measurable so that FA graphs provide a quantitative measure of the semantic coherence of small groups of words.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.77689737 <a title="100-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Improvements_to_the_Bayesian_Topic_N-Gram_Models.html">100 emnlp-2013-Improvements to the Bayesian Topic N-Gram Models</a></p>

Our model is based on scoring functions that operate by learning low-dimensional embeddings of words, entities and relationships from a knowledge base.

<p>Author: He He ; Hal Daume III ; Jason Eisner</p><p>Abstract: Feature computation and exhaustive search have significantly restricted the speed of graph-based dependency parsing. We propose a faster framework of dynamic feature selection, where features are added sequentially as needed, edges are pruned early, and decisions are made online for each sentence. We model this as a sequential decision-making problem and solve it by imitation learning techniques. We test our method on 7 languages. Our dynamic parser can achieve accuracies comparable or even superior to parsers using a full set of features, while computing fewer than 30% of the feature templates.</p><p>6 0.45183375 <a title="100-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Joint_Bootstrapping_of_Corpus_Annotations_and_Entity_Types.html">110 emnlp-2013-Joint Bootstrapping of Corpus Annotations and Entity Types</a></p>

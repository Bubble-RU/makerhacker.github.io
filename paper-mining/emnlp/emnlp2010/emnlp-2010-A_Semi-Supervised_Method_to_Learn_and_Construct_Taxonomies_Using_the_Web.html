<p>Author: Quang Do ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Determining whether two terms in text have an ancestor relation (e.g. Toyota and car) or a sibling relation (e.g. Toyota and Honda) is an essential component of textual inference in NLP applications such as Question Answering, Summarization, and Recognizing Textual Entailment. Significant work has been done on developing stationary knowledge sources that could potentially support these tasks, but these resources often suffer from low coverage, noise, and are inflexible when needed to support terms that are not identical to those placed in them, making their use as general purpose background knowledge resources difficult. In this paper, rather than building a stationary hierarchical structure of terms and relations, we describe a system that, given two terms, determines the taxonomic relation between them using a machine learning-based approach that makes use of existing resources. Moreover, we develop a global constraint opti- mization inference process and use it to leverage an existing knowledge base also to enforce relational constraints among terms and thus improve the classifier predictions. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms other systems built upon existing well-known knowledge sources.</p><p>3 0.24056634 <a title="12-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Function-Based_Question_Classification_for_General_QA.html">51 emnlp-2010-Function-Based Question Classification for General QA</a></p>
<p>Author: Fan Bu ; Xingwei Zhu ; Yu Hao ; Xiaoyan Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In contrast with the booming increase of internet data, state-of-art QA (question answering) systems, otherwise, concerned data from specific domains or resources such as search engine snippets, online forums and Wikipedia in a somewhat isolated way. Users may welcome a more general QA system for its capability to answer questions of various sources, integrated from existed specialized sub-QA engines. In this framework, question classification is the primary task. However, the current paradigms of question classification were focused on some specified type of questions, i.e. factoid questions, which are inappropriate for the general QA. In this paper, we propose a new question classification paradigm, which includes a question taxonomy suitable to the general QA and a question classifier based on MLN (Markov logic network), where rule-based methods and statistical methods are unified into a single framework in a fuzzy discriminative learning approach. Experiments show that our method outperforms traditional question classification approaches.</p><p>4 0.078878507 <a title="12-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Inducing_Word_Senses_to_Improve_Web_Search_Result_Clustering.html">66 emnlp-2010-Inducing Word Senses to Improve Web Search Result Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Roberto Navigli ; Giuseppe Crisafulli</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to Web search result clustering based on the automatic discovery of word senses from raw text, a task referred to as Word Sense Induction (WSI). We first acquire the senses (i.e., meanings) of a query by means of a graphbased clustering algorithm that exploits cycles (triangles and squares) in the co-occurrence graph of the query. Then we cluster the search results based on their semantic similarity to the induced word senses. Our experiments, conducted on datasets of ambiguous queries, show that our approach improves search result clustering in terms of both clustering quality and degree of diversification.</p><p>5 0.049597211 <a title="12-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Mixture_Model_with_Sharing_for_Lexical_Semantics.html">7 emnlp-2010-A Mixture Model with Sharing for Lexical Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Reisinger ; Raymond Mooney</p><p>Abstract: We introduce tiered clustering, a mixture model capable of accounting for varying degrees of shared (context-independent) feature structure, and demonstrate its applicability to inferring distributed representations of word meaning. Common tasks in lexical semantics such as word relatedness or selectional preference can benefit from modeling such structure: Polysemous word usage is often governed by some common background metaphoric usage (e.g. the senses of line or run), and likewise modeling the selectional preference of verbs relies on identifying commonalities shared by their typical arguments. Tiered clustering can also be viewed as a form of soft feature selection, where features that do not contribute meaningfully to the clustering can be excluded. We demonstrate the applicability of tiered clustering, highlighting particular cases where modeling shared structure is beneficial and where it can be detrimental.</p><p>6 0.045176588 <a title="12-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Automatic_Discovery_of_Manner_Relations_and_its_Applications.html">21 emnlp-2010-Automatic Discovery of Manner Relations and its Applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Tara McIntosh</p><p>Abstract: Multi-category bootstrapping algorithms were developed to reduce semantic drift. By extracting multiple semantic lexicons simultaneously, a category’s search space may be restricted. The best results have been achieved through reliance on manually crafted negative categories. Unfortunately, identifying these categories is non-trivial, and their use shifts the unsupervised bootstrapping paradigm towards a supervised framework. We present NEG-FINDER, the first approach for discovering negative categories automatically. NEG-FINDER exploits unsupervised term clustering to generate multiple negative categories during bootstrapping. Our algorithm effectively removes the necessity of manual intervention and formulation of negative categories, with performance closely approaching that obtained using negative categories defined by a domain expert.</p><p>5 0.16379578 <a title="12-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Automatic_Discovery_of_Manner_Relations_and_its_Applications.html">21 emnlp-2010-Automatic Discovery of Manner Relations and its Applications</a></p>
<p>Author: Eduardo Blanco ; Dan Moldovan</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for the automatic discovery of MANNER relations from text. An extended definition of MANNER is proposed, including restrictions on the sorts of concepts that can be part of its domain and range. The connections with other relations and the lexico-syntactic patterns that encode MANNER are analyzed. A new feature set specialized on MANNER detection is depicted and justified. Experimental results show improvement over previous attempts to extract MANNER. Combinations of MANNER with other semantic relations are also discussed.</p><p>6 0.16325669 <a title="12-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Inducing_Word_Senses_to_Improve_Web_Search_Result_Clustering.html">66 emnlp-2010-Inducing Word Senses to Improve Web Search Result Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Dave Golland ; Percy Liang ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Language is sensitive to both semantic and pragmatic effects. To capture both effects, we model language use as a cooperative game between two players: a speaker, who generates an utterance, and a listener, who responds with an action. Specifically, we consider the task of generating spatial references to objects, wherein the listener must accurately identify an object described by the speaker. We show that a speaker model that acts optimally with respect to an explicit, embedded listener model substantially outperforms one that is trained to directly generate spatial descriptions.</p><p>3 0.27928662 <a title="12-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Constraints_Based_Taxonomic_Relation_Classification.html">31 emnlp-2010-Constraints Based Taxonomic Relation Classification</a></p>

Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms other systems built upon existing well-known knowledge sources.</p><p>4 0.20658395 <a title="12-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Simple_Domain-Independent_Probabilistic_Approach_to_Generation.html">13 emnlp-2010-A Simple Domain-Independent Probabilistic Approach to Generation</a></p>

In our approach, we break up the end-to-end generation process into a sequence of local decisions, arranged hierarchically and each trained discriminatively. We deployed our system in three different domains—Robocup sportscasting, technical weather forecasts, and common weather forecasts, obtaining results comparable to state-ofthe-art domain-specific systems both in terms of BLEU scores and human evaluation.</p><p>5 0.20116164 <a title="12-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Learning_the_Relative_Usefulness_of_Questions_in_Community_QA.html">74 emnlp-2010-Learning the Relative Usefulness of Questions in Community QA</a></p>
<p>Author: Razvan Bunescu ; Yunfeng Huang</p><p>Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for the task of ranking previously answered questions in a question repository with respect to their relevance to a new, unanswered reference question. The ranking model is trained on a collection of question groups manually annotated with a partial order relation reflecting the relative utility of questions inside each group. Based on a set of meaning and structure aware features, the new ranking model is able to substantially outperform more straightforward, unsupervised similarity measures.</p><p>6 0.20108463 <a title="12-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Translingual_Document_Representations_from_Discriminative_Projections.html">109 emnlp-2010-Translingual Document Representations from Discriminative Projections</a></p>

The product model is most effective when the individual underlying grammars are most diverse.

<p>Author: Ming-Wei Chang ; Michael Connor ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Problems stemming from domain adaptation continue to plague the statistical natural language processing community. There has been continuing work trying to find general purpose algorithms to alleviate this problem. In this paper we argue that existing general purpose approaches usually only focus on one of two issues related to the difficulties faced by adaptation: 1) difference in base feature statistics or 2) task differences that can be detected with labeled data. We argue that it is necessary to combine these two classes of adaptation algorithms, using evidence collected through theoretical analysis and simulated and real-world data experiments. We find that the combined approach often outperforms the individual adaptation approaches. By combining simple approaches from each class of adaptation algorithm, we achieve state-of-the-art results for both Named Entity Recognition adaptation task and the Preposition Sense Disambiguation adaptation task. Second, we also show that applying an adaptation algorithm that finds shared representation between domains often impacts the choice in adaptation algorithm that makes use of target labeled data.</p><p>4 0.10957305 <a title="81-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation_Grammars_Extracted_from_Alignment_Posterior_Probabilities.html">57 emnlp-2010-Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation Grammars Extracted from Alignment Posterior Probabilities</a></p>
<p>Author: Adria de Gispert ; Juan Pino ; William Byrne</p><p>Abstract: We report on investigations into hierarchical phrase-based translation grammars based on rules extracted from posterior distributions over alignments of the parallel text. Rather than restrict rule extraction to a single alignment, such as Viterbi, we instead extract rules based on posterior distributions provided by the HMM word-to-word alignmentmodel. We define translation grammars progressively by adding classes of rules to a basic phrase-based system. We assess these grammars in terms of their expressive power, measured by their ability to align the parallel text from which their rules are extracted, and the quality of the translations they yield. In Chinese-to-English translation, we find that rule extraction from posteriors gives translation improvements. We also find that grammars with rules with only one nonterminal, when extracted from posteri- ors, can outperform more complex grammars extracted from Viterbi alignments. Finally, we show that the best way to exploit source-totarget and target-to-source alignment models is to build two separate systems and combine their output translation lattices.</p><p>5 0.1050919 <a title="81-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Using_Universal_Linguistic_Knowledge_to_Guide_Grammar_Induction.html">116 emnlp-2010-Using Universal Linguistic Knowledge to Guide Grammar Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Phil Blunsom ; Trevor Cohn</p><p>Abstract: Inducing a grammar directly from text is one of the oldest and most challenging tasks in Computational Linguistics. Significant progress has been made for inducing dependency grammars, however the models employed are overly simplistic, particularly in comparison to supervised parsing models. In this paper we present an approach to dependency grammar induction using tree substitution grammar which is capable of learning large dependency fragments and thereby better modelling the text. We define a hierarchical non-parametric Pitman-Yor Process prior which biases towards a small grammar with simple productions. This approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art, when measured by head attachment accuracy.</p><p>5 0.42015758 <a title="81-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2010-EMNLP_044.html">39 emnlp-2010-EMNLP 044</a></p>
<p>Author: George Foster</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new approach to SMT adaptation that weights out-of-domain phrase pairs according to their relevance to the target domain, determined by both how similar to it they appear to be, and whether they belong to general language or not. This extends previous work on discriminative weighting by using a finer granularity, focusing on the properties of instances rather than corpus components, and using a simpler training procedure. We incorporate instance weighting into a mixture-model framework, and find that it yields consistent improvements over a wide range of baselines.</p><p>6 0.38926062 <a title="81-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Using_Universal_Linguistic_Knowledge_to_Guide_Grammar_Induction.html">116 emnlp-2010-Using Universal Linguistic Knowledge to Guide Grammar Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop multilingual supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (MLSLDA), a probabilistic generative model that allows insights gleaned from one language’s data to inform how the model captures properties of other languages. MLSLDA accomplishes this by jointly modeling two aspects of text: how multilingual concepts are clustered into thematically coherent topics and how topics associated with text connect to an observed regression variable (such as ratings on a sentiment scale). Concepts are represented in a general hierarchical framework that is flexible enough to express semantic ontologies, dictionaries, clustering constraints, and, as a special, degenerate case, conventional topic models. Both the topics and the regression are discovered via posterior inference from corpora. We show MLSLDA can build topics that are consistent across languages, discover sensible bilingual lexical correspondences, and leverage multilingual corpora to better predict sentiment. Sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008) offers the promise of automatically discerning how people feel about a product, person, organization, or issue based on what they write online, which is potentially of great value to businesses and other organizations. However, the vast majority of sentiment resources and algorithms are limited to a single language, usually English (Wilson, 2008; Baccianella and Sebastiani, 2010). Since no single language captures a majority of the content online, adopting such a limited approach in an increasingly global community risks missing important details and trends that might only be available when text in multiple languages is taken into account. 45 Philip Resnik Department of Linguistics and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD re snik@umd .edu Up to this point, multiple languages have been addressed in sentiment analysis primarily by transferring knowledge from a resource-rich language to a less rich language (Banea et al., 2008), or by ignoring differences in languages via translation into English (Denecke, 2008). These approaches are limited to a view of sentiment that takes place through an English-centric lens, and they ignore the potential to share information between languages. Ideally, learning sentiment cues holistically, across languages, would result in a richer and more globally consistent picture. In this paper, we introduce Multilingual Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (MLSLDA), a model for sentiment analysis on a multilingual corpus. MLSLDA discovers a consistent, unified picture of sentiment across multiple languages by learning “topics,” probabilistic partitions of the vocabulary that are consistent in terms of both meaning and relevance to observed sentiment. Our approach makes few assumptions about available resources, requiring neither parallel corpora nor machine translation. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 1, we describe the probabilistic tools that we use to create consistent topics bridging across languages and the MLSLDA model. In Section 2, we present the inference process. We discuss our set of semantic bridges between languages in Section 3, and our experiments in Section 4 demonstrate that this approach functions as an effective multilingual topic model, discovers sentiment-biased topics, and uses multilingual corpora to make better sentiment predictions across languages. Sections 5 and 6 discuss related research and discusses future work, respectively.

Both the topics and the assignments are probabilistic: a topic is represented as a probability distribution over words in the corpus, and each document is assigned a probability distribution over all the topics. Topic models built on the foundations of LDA are appealing for sentiment analysis because the learned topics can cluster together sentimentbearing words, and because topic distributions are a parsimonious way to represent a document.1 LDA has been used to discover latent structure in text (e.g. for discourse segmentation (Purver et al., 2006) and authorship (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004)). MLSLDA extends the approach by ensuring that this latent structure the underlying topics is consistent across languages. We discuss multilingual topic modeling in Section 1. 1, and in Section 1.2 we show how this enables supervised regression regardless of a document’s language. — — 1.1 Capturing Semantic Correlations Topic models posit a straightforward generative process that creates an observed corpus. For each docu- ment d, some distribution θd over unobserved topics is chosen. Then, for each word position in the document, a topic z is selected. Finally, the word for that position is generated by selecting from the topic indexed by z. (Recall that in LDA, a “topic” is a distribution over words). In monolingual topic models, the topic distribution is usually drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Using Dirichlet distributions makes it easy to specify sparse priors, and it also simplifies posterior inference because Dirichlet distributions are conjugate to multinomial distributions. However, drawing topics from Dirichlet distributions will not suffice if our vocabulary includes multiple languages. If we are working with English, German, and Chinese at the same time, a Dirichlet prior has no way to favor distributions z such that p(good|z), p(gut|z), and 1The latter property has also made LDA popular for information retrieval (Wei and Croft, 2006)). 46 p(h aˇo|z) all tend to be high at the same time, or low at hth ˇaeo same lti tmened. tMoo bree generally, et sheam structure oorf our model must encourage topics to be consistent across languages, and Dirichlet distributions cannot encode correlations between elements. One possible solution to this problem is to use the multivariate normal distribution, which can produce correlated multinomials (Blei and Lafferty, 2005), in place of the Dirichlet distribution. This has been done successfully in multilingual settings (Cohen and Smith, 2009). However, such models complicate inference by not being conjugate. Instead, we appeal to tree-based extensions of the Dirichlet distribution, which has been used to induce correlation in semantic ontologies (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007) and to encode clustering constraints (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). The key idea in this approach is to assume the vocabularies of all languages are organized according to some shared semantic structure that can be represented as a tree. For concreteness in this section, we will use WordNet (Miller, 1990) as the representation of this multilingual semantic bridge, since it is well known, offers convenient and intuitive terminology, and demonstrates the full flexibility of our approach. However, the model we describe generalizes to any tree-structured rep- resentation of multilingual knowledge; we discuss some alternatives in Section 3. WordNet organizes a vocabulary into a rooted, directed acyclic graph of nodes called synsets, short for “synonym sets.” A synset is a child of another synset if it satisfies a hyponomy relationship; each child “is a” more specific instantiation of its parent concept (thus, hyponomy is often called an “isa” relationship). For example, a “dog” is a “canine” is an “animal” is a “living thing,” etc. As an approximation, it is not unreasonable to assume that WordNet’s structure of meaning is language independent, i.e. the concept encoded by a synset can be realized using terms in different languages that share the same meaning. In practice, this organization has been used to create many alignments of international WordNets to the original English WordNet (Ordan and Wintner, 2007; Sagot and Fiˇ ser, 2008; Isahara et al., 2008). Using the structure of WordNet, we can now describe a generative process that produces a distribution over a multilingual vocabulary, which encourages correlations between words with similar meanings regardless of what language each word is in. For each synset h, we create a multilingual word distribution for that synset as follows: 1. Draw transition probabilities βh ∼ Dir (τh) 2. Draw stop probabilities ωh ∼ Dir∼ (κ Dhi)r 3. For each language l, draw emission probabilities for that synset φh,l ∼ Dir (πh,l) . For conciseness in the rest of the paper, we will refer to this generative process as multilingual Dirichlet hierarchy, or MULTDIRHIER(τ, κ, π) .2 Each observed token can be viewed as the end result of a sequence of visited synsets λ. At each node in the tree, the path can end at node iwith probability ωi,1, or it can continue to a child synset with probability ωi,0. If the path continues to another child synset, it visits child j with probability βi,j. If the path ends at a synset, it generates word k with probability φi,l,k.3 The probability of a word being emitted from a path with visited synsets r and final synset h in language lis therefore p(w, λ = r, h|l, β, ω, φ) = (iY,j)∈rβi,jωi,0(1 − ωh,1)φh,l,w. Note that the stop probability ωh (1) is independent of language, but the emission φh,l is dependent on the language. This is done to prevent the following scenario: while synset A is highly probable in a topic and words in language 1attached to that synset have high probability, words in language 2 have low probability. If this could happen for many synsets in a topic, an entire language would be effectively silenced, which would lead to inconsistent topics (e.g. 2Variables τh, πh,l, and κh are hyperparameters. Their mean is fixed, but their magnitude is sampled during inference (i.e. Pkτhτ,ih,k is constant, but τh,i is not). For the bushier bridges, (Pe.g. dictionary and flat), their mean is uniform. For GermaNet, we took frequencies from two balanced corpora of German and English: the British National Corpus (University of Oxford, 2006) and the Kern Corpus of the Digitales Wo¨rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache des 20. Jahrhunderts project (Geyken, 2007). We took these frequencies and propagated them through the multilingual hierarchy, following LDAWN’s (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007) formulation of information content (Resnik, 1995) as a Bayesian prior. The variance of the priors was initialized to be 1.0, but could be sampled during inference. 3Note that the language and word are taken as given, but the path through the semantic hierarchy is a latent random variable. 47 Topic 1 is about baseball in English and about travel in German). Separating path from emission helps ensure that topics are consistent across languages. Having defined topic distributions in a way that can preserve cross-language correspondences, we now use this distribution within a larger model that can discover cross-language patterns of use that predict sentiment. 1.2 The MLSLDA Model We will view sentiment analysis as a regression problem: given an input document, we want to predict a real-valued observation y that represents the sentiment of a document. Specifically, we build on supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (SLDA, (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007)), which makes predictions based on the topics expressed in a document; this can be thought of projecting the words in a document to low dimensional space of dimension equal to the number of topics. Blei et al. showed that using this latent topic structure can offer improved predictions over regressions based on words alone, and the approach fits well with our current goals, since word-level cues are unlikely to be identical across languages. In addition to text, SLDA has been successfully applied to other domains such as social networks (Chang and Blei, 2009) and image classification (Wang et al., 2009). The key innovation in this paper is to extend SLDA by creating topics that are globally consistent across languages, using the bridging approach above. We express our model in the form of a probabilistic generative latent-variable model that generates documents in multiple languages and assigns a realvalued score to each document. The score comes from a normal distribution whose sum is the dot product between a regression parameter η that encodes the influence of each topic on the observation and a variance σ2. With this model in hand, we use statistical inference to determine the distribution over latent variables that, given the model, best explains observed data. The generative model is as follows: 1. For each topic i= 1. . . K, draw a topic distribution {βi, ωi, φi} from MULTDIRHIER(τ, κ, π). 2. {Foβr each do}cuf mroemn tM Md = 1. . . M with language ld: (a) CDihro(oαse). a distribution over topics θd ∼ (b) For each word in the document n = 1. . . Nd, choose a topic assignment zd,n ∼ Mult (θd) and a path λd,n ending at word wd,n according to Equation 1using {βzd,n , ωzd,n , φzd,n }. 3. Choose a re?sponse variable from y Norm ?η> z¯, σ2?, where z¯ d ≡ N1 PnN=1 zd,n. ∼ Crucially, note that the topics are not independent of the sentiment task; the regression encourages terms with similar effects on the observation y to be in the same topic. The consistency of topics described above allows the same regression to be done for the entire corpus regardless of the language of the underlying document. 2 Inference Finding the model parameters most likely to explain the data is a problem of statistical inference. We employ stochastic EM (Diebolt and Ip, 1996), using a Gibbs sampler for the E-step to assign words to paths and topics. After randomly initializing the topics, we alternate between sampling the topic and path of a word (zd,n, λd,n) and finding the regression parameters η that maximize the likelihood. We jointly sample the topic and path conditioning on all of the other path and document assignments in the corpus, selecting a path and topic with probability p(zn = k, λn = r|z−n , λ−n, wn , η, σ, Θ) = p(yd|z, η, σ)p(λn = r|zn = k, λ−n, wn, τ, p(zn = k|z−n, α) . κ, π) (2) Each of these three terms reflects a different influence on the topics from the vocabulary structure, the document’s topics, and the response variable. In the next paragraphs, we will expand each of them to derive the full conditional topic distribution. As discussed in Section 1.1, the structure of the topic distribution encourages terms with the same meaning to be in the same topic, even across languages. During inference, we marginalize over possible multinomial distributions β, ω, and φ, using the observed transitions from ito j in topic k; Tk,i,j, stop counts in synset iin topic k, Ok,i,0; continue counts in synsets iin topic k, Ok,i,1 ; and emission counts in synset iin language lin topic k, Fk,i,l.

The conditional topic distribution for SLDA (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007) replaces this term with the standard Multinomial-Dirichlet. However, we believe this is the first published SLDA-style model using MCMC inference, as prior work has used variational inference (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007; Chang and Blei, 2009; Wang et al., 2009). Because the observed response variable depends on the topic assignments of a document, the conditional topic distribution is shifted toward topics that explain the observed response. Topics that move the predicted response yˆd toward the true yd will be favored.

<p>Author: Samidh Chatterjee ; Nicola Cancedda</p><p>Abstract: Minimum Error Rate Training is the algorithm for log-linear model parameter training most used in state-of-the-art Statistical Machine Translation systems. In its original formulation, the algorithm uses N-best lists output by the decoder to grow the Translation Pool that shapes the surface on which the actual optimization is performed. Recent work has been done to extend the algorithm to use the entire translation lattice built by the decoder, instead of N-best lists. We propose here a third, intermediate way, consisting in growing the translation pool using samples randomly drawn from the translation lattice. We empirically measure a systematic im- provement in the BLEU scores compared to training using N-best lists, without suffering the increase in computational complexity associated with operating with the whole lattice.</p><p>5 0.49281034 <a title="81-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Crouching_Dirichlet%2C_Hidden_Markov_Model%3A_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging_with_Context_Local_Tag_Generation.html">34 emnlp-2010-Crouching Dirichlet, Hidden Markov Model: Unsupervised POS Tagging with Context Local Tag Generation</a></p>

This simple modification of the HMM takes advantage of the dichotomy in natural language between content and function words. In contrast, a standard HMM draws all prior distributions once over all states and it is known to perform poorly in unsupervised and semisupervised POS tagging. This modification significantly improves unsupervised POS tagging performance across several measures on five data sets for four languages. We also show that simply using different hyperparameter values for content and function word states in a standard HMM (which we call HMM+) is surprisingly effective.</p><p>6 0.4887453 <a title="81-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Latent-Descriptor_Clustering_for_Unsupervised_POS_Induction.html">71 emnlp-2010-Latent-Descriptor Clustering for Unsupervised POS Induction</a></p>

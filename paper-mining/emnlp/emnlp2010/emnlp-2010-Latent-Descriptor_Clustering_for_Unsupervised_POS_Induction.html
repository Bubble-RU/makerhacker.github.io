<p>Author: Yoong Keok Lee ; Aria Haghighi ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tag distributions are known to exhibit sparsity a word is likely to take a single predominant tag in a corpus. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating this sparsity constraint improves tagging accuracy. However, in existing systems, this expansion come with a steep increase in model complexity. This paper proposes a simple and effective tagging method that directly models tag sparsity and other distributional properties of valid POS tag assignments. In addition, this formulation results in a dramatic reduction in the number of model parameters thereby, enabling unusually rapid training. Our experiments consistently demonstrate that this model architecture yields substantial performance gains over more complex tagging — counterparts.

<p>Author: Christos Christodoulopoulos ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) induction is one of the most popular tasks in research on unsupervised NLP. Many different methods have been proposed, yet comparisons are difficult to make since there is little consensus on evaluation framework, and many papers evaluate against only one or two competitor systems. Here we evaluate seven different POS induction systems spanning nearly 20 years of work, using a variety of measures. We show that some of the oldest (and simplest) systems stand up surprisingly well against more recent approaches. Since most of these systems were developed and tested using data from the WSJ corpus, we compare their generalization abil- ities by testing on both WSJ and the multilingual Multext-East corpus. Finally, we introduce the idea of evaluating systems based on their ability to produce cluster prototypes that are useful as input to a prototype-driven learner. In most cases, the prototype-driven learner outperforms the unsupervised system used to initialize it, yielding state-of-the-art results on WSJ and improvements on nonEnglish corpora.</p><p>4 0.14550993 <a title="71-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Crouching_Dirichlet%2C_Hidden_Markov_Model%3A_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging_with_Context_Local_Tag_Generation.html">34 emnlp-2010-Crouching Dirichlet, Hidden Markov Model: Unsupervised POS Tagging with Context Local Tag Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Taesun Moon ; Katrin Erk ; Jason Baldridge</p><p>Abstract: We define the crouching Dirichlet, hidden Markov model (CDHMM), an HMM for partof-speech tagging which draws state prior distributions for each local document context. This simple modification of the HMM takes advantage of the dichotomy in natural language between content and function words. In contrast, a standard HMM draws all prior distributions once over all states and it is known to perform poorly in unsupervised and semisupervised POS tagging. This modification significantly improves unsupervised POS tagging performance across several measures on five data sets for four languages. We also show that simply using different hyperparameter values for content and function word states in a standard HMM (which we call HMM+) is surprisingly effective.</p><p>5 0.11862928 <a title="71-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based_Stratified_Seed_Sampling_for_Semi-Supervised_Relation_Classification.html">27 emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based Stratified Seed Sampling for Semi-Supervised Relation Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Longhua Qian ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Seed sampling is critical in semi-supervised learning. This paper proposes a clusteringbased stratified seed sampling approach to semi-supervised learning. First, various clustering algorithms are explored to partition the unlabeled instances into different strata with each stratum represented by a center. Then, diversity-motivated intra-stratum sampling is adopted to choose the center and additional instances from each stratum to form the unlabeled seed set for an oracle to annotate. Finally, the labeled seed set is fed into a bootstrapping procedure as the initial labeled data. We systematically evaluate our stratified bootstrapping approach in the semantic relation classification subtask of the ACE RDC (Relation Detection and Classification) task. In particular, we compare various clustering algorithms on the stratified bootstrapping performance. Experimental results on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus show that our clusteringbased stratified bootstrapping approach achieves the best F1-score of 75.9 on the subtask of semantic relation classification, approaching the one with golden clustering.</p><p>6 0.1127435 <a title="71-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Nouns_are_Vectors%2C_Adjectives_are_Matrices%3A_Representing_Adjective-Noun_Constructions_in_Semantic_Space.html">87 emnlp-2010-Nouns are Vectors, Adjectives are Matrices: Representing Adjective-Noun Constructions in Semantic Space</a></p>

<p>Author: Joseph Reisinger ; Raymond Mooney</p><p>Abstract: We introduce tiered clustering, a mixture model capable of accounting for varying degrees of shared (context-independent) feature structure, and demonstrate its applicability to inferring distributed representations of word meaning. Common tasks in lexical semantics such as word relatedness or selectional preference can benefit from modeling such structure: Polysemous word usage is often governed by some common background metaphoric usage (e.g. the senses of line or run), and likewise modeling the selectional preference of verbs relies on identifying commonalities shared by their typical arguments. Tiered clustering can also be viewed as a form of soft feature selection, where features that do not contribute meaningfully to the clustering can be excluded. We demonstrate the applicability of tiered clustering, highlighting particular cases where modeling shared structure is beneficial and where it can be detrimental.</p><p>6 0.51257181 <a title="71-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Training_Continuous_Space_Language_Models%3A_Some_Practical_Issues.html">108 emnlp-2010-Training Continuous Space Language Models: Some Practical Issues</a></p>

<p>Author: Tahira Naseem ; Harr Chen ; Regina Barzilay ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to grammar induction that utilizes syntactic universals to improve dependency parsing across a range of languages. Our method uses a single set of manually-specified language-independent rules that identify syntactic dependencies between pairs of syntactic categories that commonly occur across languages. During inference of the probabilistic model, we use posterior expectation constraints to require that a minimum proportion of the dependencies we infer be instances of these rules. We also automatically refine the syntactic categories given in our coarsely tagged input. Across six languages our approach outperforms state-of-theart unsupervised methods by a significant margin.1</p><p>4 0.6798296 <a title="71-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Latent_Variable_Model_for_Geographic_Lexical_Variation.html">6 emnlp-2010-A Latent Variable Model for Geographic Lexical Variation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob Eisenstein ; Brendan O'Connor ; Noah A. Smith ; Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: The rapid growth of geotagged social media raises new computational possibilities for investigating geographic linguistic variation. In this paper, we present a multi-level generative model that reasons jointly about latent topics and geographical regions. High-level topics such as “sports” or “entertainment” are rendered differently in each geographic region, revealing topic-specific regional distinctions. Applied to a new dataset of geotagged microblogs, our model recovers coherent topics and their regional variants, while identifying geographic areas of linguistic consistency. The model also enables prediction of an author’s geographic location from raw text, outperforming both text regression and supervised topic models.</p><p>5 0.67417109 <a title="71-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Facilitating_Translation_Using_Source_Language_Paraphrase_Lattices.html">50 emnlp-2010-Facilitating Translation Using Source Language Paraphrase Lattices</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinhua Du ; Jie Jiang ; Andy Way</p><p>Abstract: For resource-limited language pairs, coverage of the test set by the parallel corpus is an important factor that affects translation quality in two respects: 1) out of vocabulary words; 2) the same information in an input sentence can be expressed in different ways, while current phrase-based SMT systems cannot automatically select an alternative way to transfer the same information. Therefore, given limited data, in order to facilitate translation from the input side, this paper proposes a novel method to reduce the translation difficulty using source-side lattice-based paraphrases. We utilise the original phrases from the input sentence and the corresponding paraphrases to build a lattice with estimated weights for each edge to improve translation quality. Compared to the baseline system, our method achieves relative improvements of 7.07%, 6.78% and 3.63% in terms of BLEU score on small, medium and large- scale English-to-Chinese translation tasks respectively. The results show that the proposed method is effective not only for resourcelimited language pairs, but also for resourcesufficient pairs to some extent.</p><p>6 0.67037308 <a title="71-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Simple_Type-Level_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging.html">97 emnlp-2010-Simple Type-Level Unsupervised POS Tagging</a></p>

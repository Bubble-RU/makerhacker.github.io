<p>Author: Adria de Gispert ; Juan Pino ; William Byrne</p><p>Abstract: We report on investigations into hierarchical phrase-based translation grammars based on rules extracted from posterior distributions over alignments of the parallel text. Rather than restrict rule extraction to a single alignment, such as Viterbi, we instead extract rules based on posterior distributions provided by the HMM word-to-word alignmentmodel. We define translation grammars progressively by adding classes of rules to a basic phrase-based system. We assess these grammars in terms of their expressive power, measured by their ability to align the parallel text from which their rules are extracted, and the quality of the translations they yield. In Chinese-to-English translation, we find that rule extraction from posteriors gives translation improvements. We also find that grammars with rules with only one nonterminal, when extracted from posteri- ors, can outperform more complex grammars extracted from Viterbi alignments. Finally, we show that the best way to exploit source-totarget and target-to-source alignment models is to build two separate systems and combine their output translation lattices.</p><p>3 0.22649026 <a title="99-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Cross_Language_Text_Classification_by_Model_Translation_and_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">33 emnlp-2010-Cross Language Text Classification by Model Translation and Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Samidh Chatterjee ; Nicola Cancedda</p><p>Abstract: Minimum Error Rate Training is the algorithm for log-linear model parameter training most used in state-of-the-art Statistical Machine Translation systems. In its original formulation, the algorithm uses N-best lists output by the decoder to grow the Translation Pool that shapes the surface on which the actual optimization is performed. Recent work has been done to extend the algorithm to use the entire translation lattice built by the decoder, instead of N-best lists. We propose here a third, intermediate way, consisting in growing the translation pool using samples randomly drawn from the translation lattice. We empirically measure a systematic im- provement in the BLEU scores compared to training using N-best lists, without suffering the increase in computational complexity associated with operating with the whole lattice.</p><p>5 0.18243828 <a title="99-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Improving_Translation_via_Targeted_Paraphrasing.html">63 emnlp-2010-Improving Translation via Targeted Paraphrasing</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip Resnik ; Olivia Buzek ; Chang Hu ; Yakov Kronrod ; Alex Quinn ; Benjamin B. Bederson</p><p>Abstract: Targeted paraphrasing is a new approach to the problem of obtaining cost-effective, reasonable quality translation that makes use of simple and inexpensive human computations by monolingual speakers in combination with machine translation. The key insight behind the process is that it is possible to spot likely translation errors with only monolingual knowledge of the target language, and it is possible to generate alternative ways to say the same thing (i.e. paraphrases) with only monolingual knowledge of the source language. Evaluations demonstrate that this approach can yield substantial improvements in translation quality.</p><p>6 0.17164218 <a title="99-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Non-Isomorphic_Forest_Pair_Translation.html">86 emnlp-2010-Non-Isomorphic Forest Pair Translation</a></p>

Moreover, EM is a loWe study self-training with products of latent variable grammars in this paper. We show that increasing the quality of the automatically parsed data used for self-training gives higher accuracy self-trained grammars. Our generative self-trained grammars reach F scores of 91.6 on the WSJ test set and surpass even discriminative reranking systems without selftraining. Additionally, we show that multiple self-trained grammars can be combined in a product model to achieve even higher accuracy. The product model is most effective when the individual underlying grammars are most diverse. Combining multiple grammars that were self-trained on disjoint sets of unlabeled data results in a final test accuracy of 92.5% on the WSJ test set and 89.6% on our Broadcast News test set.</p><p>4 0.55164725 <a title="99-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Minimum_Error_Rate_Training_by_Sampling_the_Translation_Lattice.html">78 emnlp-2010-Minimum Error Rate Training by Sampling the Translation Lattice</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Lin ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Determining whether a textual phrase denotes a functional relation (i.e., a relation that maps each domain element to a unique range element) is useful for numerous NLP tasks such as synonym resolution and contradiction detection. Previous work on this problem has relied on either counting methods or lexico-syntactic patterns. However, determining whether a relation is functional, by analyzing mentions of the relation in a corpus, is challenging due to ambiguity, synonymy, anaphora, and other linguistic phenomena. We present the LEIBNIZ system that overcomes these challenges by exploiting the synergy between the Web corpus and freelyavailable knowledge resources such as Freebase. It first computes multiple typedfunctionality scores, representing functionality of the relation phrase when its arguments are constrained to specific types. It then aggregates these scores to predict the global functionality for the phrase. LEIBNIZ outperforms previous work, increasing area under the precisionrecall curve from 0.61 to 0.88. We utilize LEIBNIZ to generate the first public repository of automatically-identified functional relations.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.68132555 <a title="99-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2010-Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_a_Factorized_Grammar.html">99 emnlp-2010-Statistical Machine Translation with a Factorized Grammar</a></p>

<p>Author: John Platt ; Kristina Toutanova ; Wen-tau Yih</p><p>Abstract: Representing documents by vectors that are independent of language enhances machine translation and multilingual text categorization. We use discriminative training to create a projection of documents from multiple languages into a single translingual vector space. We explore two variants to create these projections: Oriented Principal Component Analysis (OPCA) and Coupled Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (CPLSA). Both of these variants start with a basic model of documents (PCA and PLSA). Each model is then made discriminative by encouraging comparable document pairs to have similar vector representations. We evaluate these algorithms on two tasks: parallel document retrieval for Wikipedia and Europarl documents, and cross-lingual text classification on Reuters. The two discriminative variants, OPCA and CPLSA, significantly outperform their corre- sponding baselines. The largest differences in performance are observed on the task of retrieval when the documents are only comparable and not parallel. The OPCA method is shown to perform best.</p><p>4 0.45038337 <a title="99-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Positional_Language_Models_for_Clinical_Information_Retrieval.html">90 emnlp-2010-Positional Language Models for Clinical Information Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Florian Boudin ; Jian-Yun Nie ; Martin Dawes</p><p>Abstract: The PECO framework is a knowledge representation for formulating clinical questions. Queries are decomposed into four aspects, which are Patient-Problem (P), Exposure (E), Comparison (C) and Outcome (O). However, no test collection is available to evaluate such framework in information retrieval. In this work, we first present the construction of a large test collection extracted from systematic literature reviews. We then describe an analysis of the distribution of PECO elements throughout the relevant documents and propose a language modeling approach that uses these distributions as a weighting strategy. In our experiments carried out on a collection of 1.5 million documents and 423 queries, our method was found to lead to an improvement of 28% in MAP and 50% in P@5, as com- pared to the state-of-the-art method.</p><p>5 0.42316982 <a title="99-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Discriminative_Word_Alignment_with_a_Function_Word_Reordering_Model.html">36 emnlp-2010-Discriminative Word Alignment with a Function Word Reordering Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Chris Dyer ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: We address the modeling, parameter estimation and search challenges that arise from the introduction of reordering models that capture non-local reordering in alignment modeling. In particular, we introduce several reordering models that utilize (pairs of) function words as contexts for alignment reordering. To address the parameter estimation challenge, we propose to estimate these reordering models from a relatively small amount of manuallyaligned corpora. To address the search challenge, we devise an iterative local search algorithm that stochastically explores reordering possibilities. By capturing non-local reordering phenomena, our proposed alignment model bears a closer resemblance to stateof-the-art translation model. Empirical results show significant improvements in alignment quality as well as in translation performance over baselines in a large-scale ChineseEnglish translation task.</p><p>6 0.41938052 <a title="99-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Joint_Inference_for_Bilingual_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">68 emnlp-2010-Joint Inference for Bilingual Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>

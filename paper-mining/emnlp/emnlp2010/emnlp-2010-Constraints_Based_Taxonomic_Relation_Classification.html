<p>Author: Fan Bu ; Xingwei Zhu ; Yu Hao ; Xiaoyan Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In contrast with the booming increase of internet data, state-of-art QA (question answering) systems, otherwise, concerned data from specific domains or resources such as search engine snippets, online forums and Wikipedia in a somewhat isolated way. Users may welcome a more general QA system for its capability to answer questions of various sources, integrated from existed specialized sub-QA engines. In this framework, question classification is the primary task. However, the current paradigms of question classification were focused on some specified type of questions, i.e. factoid questions, which are inappropriate for the general QA. In this paper, we propose a new question classification paradigm, which includes a question taxonomy suitable to the general QA and a question classifier based on MLN (Markov logic network), where rule-based methods and statistical methods are unified into a single framework in a fuzzy discriminative learning approach. Experiments show that our method outperforms traditional question classification approaches.</p><p>4 0.059341963 <a title="31-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Inducing_Word_Senses_to_Improve_Web_Search_Result_Clustering.html">66 emnlp-2010-Inducing Word Senses to Improve Web Search Result Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Roberto Navigli ; Giuseppe Crisafulli</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to Web search result clustering based on the automatic discovery of word senses from raw text, a task referred to as Word Sense Induction (WSI). We first acquire the senses (i.e., meanings) of a query by means of a graphbased clustering algorithm that exploits cycles (triangles and squares) in the co-occurrence graph of the query. Then we cluster the search results based on their semantic similarity to the induced word senses. Our experiments, conducted on datasets of ambiguous queries, show that our approach improves search result clustering in terms of both clustering quality and degree of diversification.</p><p>5 0.055928595 <a title="31-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Dual_Decomposition_for_Parsing_with_Non-Projective_Head_Automata.html">38 emnlp-2010-Dual Decomposition for Parsing with Non-Projective Head Automata</a></p>
<p>Author: Terry Koo ; Alexander M. Rush ; Michael Collins ; Tommi Jaakkola ; David Sontag</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces algorithms for nonprojective parsing based on dual decomposition. We focus on parsing algorithms for nonprojective head automata, a generalization of head-automata models to non-projective structures. The dual decomposition algorithms are simple and efficient, relying on standard dynamic programming and minimum spanning tree algorithms. They provably solve an LP relaxation of the non-projective parsing problem. Empirically the LP relaxation is very often tight: for many languages, exact solutions are achieved on over 98% of test sentences. The accuracy of our models is higher than previous work on a broad range of datasets.</p><p>6 0.05484201 <a title="31-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Negative_Categories_in_Lexicon_Bootstrapping.html">112 emnlp-2010-Unsupervised Discovery of Negative Categories in Lexicon Bootstrapping</a></p>

<p>Author: Eduardo Blanco ; Dan Moldovan</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for the automatic discovery of MANNER relations from text. An extended definition of MANNER is proposed, including restrictions on the sorts of concepts that can be part of its domain and range. The connections with other relations and the lexico-syntactic patterns that encode MANNER are analyzed. A new feature set specialized on MANNER detection is depicted and justified. Experimental results show improvement over previous attempts to extract MANNER. Combinations of MANNER with other semantic relations are also discussed.</p><p>5 0.20712587 <a title="31-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Negative_Categories_in_Lexicon_Bootstrapping.html">112 emnlp-2010-Unsupervised Discovery of Negative Categories in Lexicon Bootstrapping</a></p>
<p>Author: Tara McIntosh</p><p>Abstract: Multi-category bootstrapping algorithms were developed to reduce semantic drift. By extracting multiple semantic lexicons simultaneously, a categoryâ€™s search space may be restricted. The best results have been achieved through reliance on manually crafted negative categories. Unfortunately, identifying these categories is non-trivial, and their use shifts the unsupervised bootstrapping paradigm towards a supervised framework. We present NEG-FINDER, the first approach for discovering negative categories automatically. NEG-FINDER exploits unsupervised term clustering to generate multiple negative categories during bootstrapping. Our algorithm effectively removes the necessity of manual intervention and formulation of negative categories, with performance closely approaching that obtained using negative categories defined by a domain expert.</p><p>6 0.1869158 <a title="31-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Inducing_Word_Senses_to_Improve_Web_Search_Result_Clustering.html">66 emnlp-2010-Inducing Word Senses to Improve Web Search Result Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Dave Golland ; Percy Liang ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Language is sensitive to both semantic and pragmatic effects. To capture both effects, we model language use as a cooperative game between two players: a speaker, who generates an utterance, and a listener, who responds with an action. Specifically, we consider the task of generating spatial references to objects, wherein the listener must accurately identify an object described by the speaker. We show that a speaker model that acts optimally with respect to an explicit, embedded listener model substantially outperforms one that is trained to directly generate spatial descriptions.</p><p>4 0.41961652 <a title="31-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Learning_First-Order_Horn_Clauses_from_Web_Text.html">72 emnlp-2010-Learning First-Order Horn Clauses from Web Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Schoenmackers ; Jesse Davis ; Oren Etzioni ; Daniel Weld</p><p>Abstract: input. Even the entire Web corpus does not explicitly answer all questions, yet inference can uncover many implicit answers. But where do inference rules come from? This paper investigates the problem of learning inference rules from Web text in an unsupervised, domain-independent manner. The SHERLOCK system, described herein, is a first-order learner that acquires over 30,000 Horn clauses from Web text. SHERLOCK embodies several innovations, including a novel rule scoring function based on Statistical Relevance (Salmon et al., 1971) which is effective on ambiguous, noisy and incomplete Web extractions. Our experiments show that inference over the learned rules discovers three times as many facts (at precision 0.8) as the TEXTRUNNER system which merely extracts facts explicitly stated in Web text.</p><p>5 0.41224116 <a title="31-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Positional_Language_Models_for_Clinical_Information_Retrieval.html">90 emnlp-2010-Positional Language Models for Clinical Information Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Florian Boudin ; Jian-Yun Nie ; Martin Dawes</p><p>Abstract: The PECO framework is a knowledge representation for formulating clinical questions. Queries are decomposed into four aspects, which are Patient-Problem (P), Exposure (E), Comparison (C) and Outcome (O). However, no test collection is available to evaluate such framework in information retrieval. In this work, we first present the construction of a large test collection extracted from systematic literature reviews. We then describe an analysis of the distribution of PECO elements throughout the relevant documents and propose a language modeling approach that uses these distributions as a weighting strategy. In our experiments carried out on a collection of 1.5 million documents and 423 queries, our method was found to lead to an improvement of 28% in MAP and 50% in P@5, as com- pared to the state-of-the-art method.</p><p>6 0.40734667 <a title="31-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Unsupervised_Word_Segmentation_with_Branching_Entropy_and_MDL.html">17 emnlp-2010-An Efficient Algorithm for Unsupervised Word Segmentation with Branching Entropy and MDL</a></p>

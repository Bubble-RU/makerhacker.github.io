<p>Author: Yassine Benajiba ; Imed Zitouni</p><p>Abstract: The research question treated in this paper is centered on the idea of exploiting rich resources of one language to enhance the performance of a mention detection system of another one. We successfully achieve this goal by projecting information from one language to another via a parallel corpus. We examine the potential improvement using various degrees of linguistic information in a statistical framework and we show that the proposed technique is effective even when the target language model has access to a significantly rich feature set. Experimental results show up to 2.4F improvement in performance when the system has access to information obtained by projecting mentions from a resource-richlanguage mention detection system via a parallel corpus.</p><p>3 0.098697409 <a title="62-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-We%27re_Not_in_Kansas_Anymore%3A_Detecting_Domain_Changes_in_Streams.html">119 emnlp-2010-We're Not in Kansas Anymore: Detecting Domain Changes in Streams</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Dredze ; Tim Oates ; Christine Piatko</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation, the problem of adapting a natural language processing system trained in one domain to perform well in a different domain, has received significant attention. This paper addresses an important problem for deployed systems that has received little attention – detecting when such adaptation is needed by a system operating in the wild, i.e., performing classification over a stream of unlabeled examples. Our method uses Aodifst uannlaceb,e a dm eextraicm fpolre detecting tshhoifdts u sine sd Aatastreams, combined with classification margins to detect domain shifts. We empirically show effective domain shift detection on a variety of data sets and shift conditions.</p><p>4 0.09097033 <a title="62-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Handling_Noisy_Queries_in_Cross_Language_FAQ_Retrieval.html">55 emnlp-2010-Handling Noisy Queries in Cross Language FAQ Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Danish Contractor ; Govind Kothari ; Tanveer Faruquie ; L V Subramaniam ; Sumit Negi</p><p>Abstract: Recent times have seen a tremendous growth in mobile based data services that allow people to use Short Message Service (SMS) to access these data services. In a multilingual society it is essential that data services that were developed for a specific language be made accessible through other local languages also. In this paper, we present a service that allows a user to query a FrequentlyAsked-Questions (FAQ) database built in a local language (Hindi) using Noisy SMS English queries. The inherent noise in the SMS queries, along with the language mismatch makes this a challenging problem. We handle these two problems by formulating the query similarity over FAQ questions as a combinatorial search problem where the search space consists of combinations of dictionary variations of the noisy query and its top-N translations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-life dataset.</p><p>5 0.075173967 <a title="62-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Multi-Pass_Sieve_for_Coreference_Resolution.html">8 emnlp-2010-A Multi-Pass Sieve for Coreference Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Karthik Raghunathan ; Heeyoung Lee ; Sudarshan Rangarajan ; Nate Chambers ; Mihai Surdeanu ; Dan Jurafsky ; Christopher Manning</p><p>Abstract: Most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. This approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. Each tier builds on the previous tier’s entity cluster output. Further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. This cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. The framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. In spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. This suggests that sievebased approaches could be applied to other NLP tasks.</p><p>6 0.072746716 <a title="62-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Evaluating_Models_of_Latent_Document_Semantics_in_the_Presence_of_OCR_Errors.html">45 emnlp-2010-Evaluating Models of Latent Document Semantics in the Presence of OCR Errors</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel Walker ; William B. Lund ; Eric K. Ringger</p><p>Abstract: Models of latent document semantics such as the mixture of multinomials model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation have received substantial attention for their ability to discover topical semantics in large collections of text. In an effort to apply such models to noisy optical character recognition (OCR) text output, we endeavor to understand the effect that character-level noise can have on unsupervised topic modeling. We show the effects both with document-level topic analysis (document clustering) and with word-level topic analysis (LDA) on both synthetic and real-world OCR data. As expected, experimental results show that performance declines as word error rates increase. Common techniques for alleviating these problems, such as filtering low-frequency words, are successful in enhancing model quality, but exhibit failure trends similar to models trained on unpro- cessed OCR output in the case of LDA. To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind.</p><p>4 0.35295805 <a title="62-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Handling_Noisy_Queries_in_Cross_Language_FAQ_Retrieval.html">55 emnlp-2010-Handling Noisy Queries in Cross Language FAQ Retrieval</a></p>

We examine the potential improvement using various degrees of linguistic information in a statistical framework and we show that the proposed technique is effective even when the target language model has access to a significantly rich feature set. Experimental results show up to 2.4F improvement in performance when the system has access to information obtained by projecting mentions from a resource-richlanguage mention detection system via a parallel corpus.</p><p>3 0.41513368 <a title="62-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Learning_First-Order_Horn_Clauses_from_Web_Text.html">72 emnlp-2010-Learning First-Order Horn Clauses from Web Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Schoenmackers ; Jesse Davis ; Oren Etzioni ; Daniel Weld</p><p>Abstract: input. Even the entire Web corpus does not explicitly answer all questions, yet inference can uncover many implicit answers. But where do inference rules come from? This paper investigates the problem of learning inference rules from Web text in an unsupervised, domain-independent manner. The SHERLOCK system, described herein, is a first-order learner that acquires over 30,000 Horn clauses from Web text. SHERLOCK embodies several innovations, including a novel rule scoring function based on Statistical Relevance (Salmon et al., 1971) which is effective on ambiguous, noisy and incomplete Web extractions. Our experiments show that inference over the learned rules discovers three times as many facts (at precision 0.8) as the TEXTRUNNER system which merely extracts facts explicitly stated in Web text.</p><p>4 0.4118638 <a title="62-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Soft_Syntactic_Constraints_for_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation_Using_Latent_Syntactic_Distributions.html">98 emnlp-2010-Soft Syntactic Constraints for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation Using Latent Syntactic Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongqiang Huang ; Martin Cmejrek ; Bowen Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to enhance hierarchical phrase-based machine translation systems with linguistically motivated syntactic features. Rather than directly using treebank categories as in previous studies, we learn a set of linguistically-guided latent syntactic categories automatically from a source-side parsed, word-aligned parallel corpus, based on the hierarchical structure among phrase pairs as well as the syntactic structure of the source side. In our model, each X nonterminal in a SCFG rule is decorated with a real-valued feature vector computed based on its distribution of latent syntactic categories. These feature vectors are utilized at decod- ing time to measure the similarity between the syntactic analysis of the source side and the syntax of the SCFG rules that are applied to derive translations. Our approach maintains the advantages of hierarchical phrase-based translation systems while at the same time naturally incorporates soft syntactic constraints.</p><p>5 0.40964487 <a title="62-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Title_Generation_with_Quasi-Synchronous_Grammar.html">105 emnlp-2010-Title Generation with Quasi-Synchronous Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristian Woodsend ; Yansong Feng ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: The task of selecting information and rendering it appropriately appears in multiple contexts in summarization. In this paper we present a model that simultaneously optimizes selection and rendering preferences. The model operates over a phrase-based representation of the source document which we obtain by merging PCFG parse trees and dependency graphs. Selection preferences for individual phrases are learned discriminatively, while a quasi-synchronous grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006) captures rendering preferences such as paraphrases and compressions. Based on an integer linear programming formulation, the model learns to generate summaries that satisfy both types of preferences, while ensuring that length, topic coverage and grammar constraints are met. Experiments on headline and image caption generation show that our method obtains state-of-the-art performance using essentially the same model for both tasks without any major modifications.</p><p>6 0.40892372 <a title="62-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Top-Down_Nearly-Context-Sensitive_Parsing.html">106 emnlp-2010-Top-Down Nearly-Context-Sensitive Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Christos Christodoulopoulos ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) induction is one of the most popular tasks in research on unsupervised NLP. Many different methods have been proposed, yet comparisons are difficult to make since there is little consensus on evaluation framework, and many papers evaluate against only one or two competitor systems. Here we evaluate seven different POS induction systems spanning nearly 20 years of work, using a variety of measures. We show that some of the oldest (and simplest) systems stand up surprisingly well against more recent approaches. Since most of these systems were developed and tested using data from the WSJ corpus, we compare their generalization abil- ities by testing on both WSJ and the multilingual Multext-East corpus. Finally, we introduce the idea of evaluating systems based on their ability to produce cluster prototypes that are useful as input to a prototype-driven learner. In most cases, the prototype-driven learner outperforms the unsupervised system used to initialize it, yielding state-of-the-art results on WSJ and improvements on nonEnglish corpora.</p><p>3 0.18633203 <a title="7-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based_Stratified_Seed_Sampling_for_Semi-Supervised_Relation_Classification.html">27 emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based Stratified Seed Sampling for Semi-Supervised Relation Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Longhua Qian ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Seed sampling is critical in semi-supervised learning. This paper proposes a clusteringbased stratified seed sampling approach to semi-supervised learning. First, various clustering algorithms are explored to partition the unlabeled instances into different strata with each stratum represented by a center. Then, diversity-motivated intra-stratum sampling is adopted to choose the center and additional instances from each stratum to form the unlabeled seed set for an oracle to annotate. Finally, the labeled seed set is fed into a bootstrapping procedure as the initial labeled data. We systematically evaluate our stratified bootstrapping approach in the semantic relation classification subtask of the ACE RDC (Relation Detection and Classification) task. In particular, we compare various clustering algorithms on the stratified bootstrapping performance. Experimental results on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus show that our clusteringbased stratified bootstrapping approach achieves the best F1-score of 75.9 on the subtask of semantic relation classification, approaching the one with golden clustering.</p><p>4 0.14104119 <a title="7-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Inducing_Word_Senses_to_Improve_Web_Search_Result_Clustering.html">66 emnlp-2010-Inducing Word Senses to Improve Web Search Result Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Roberto Navigli ; Giuseppe Crisafulli</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to Web search result clustering based on the automatic discovery of word senses from raw text, a task referred to as Word Sense Induction (WSI). We first acquire the senses (i.e., meanings) of a query by means of a graphbased clustering algorithm that exploits cycles (triangles and squares) in the co-occurrence graph of the query. Then we cluster the search results based on their semantic similarity to the induced word senses. Our experiments, conducted on datasets of ambiguous queries, show that our approach improves search result clustering in terms of both clustering quality and degree of diversification.</p><p>5 0.14095409 <a title="7-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Multi-Pass_Sieve_for_Coreference_Resolution.html">8 emnlp-2010-A Multi-Pass Sieve for Coreference Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Karthik Raghunathan ; Heeyoung Lee ; Sudarshan Rangarajan ; Nate Chambers ; Mihai Surdeanu ; Dan Jurafsky ; Christopher Manning</p><p>Abstract: Most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. This approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. Each tier builds on the previous tier’s entity cluster output. Further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. This cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. The framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. In spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. This suggests that sievebased approaches could be applied to other NLP tasks.</p><p>6 0.13271146 <a title="7-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Measuring_Distributional_Similarity_in_Context.html">77 emnlp-2010-Measuring Distributional Similarity in Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Dredze ; Aren Jansen ; Glen Coppersmith ; Ken Church</p><p>Abstract: There is considerable interest in interdisciplinary combinations of automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine learning, natural language processing, text classification and information retrieval. Many of these boxes, especially ASR, are often based on considerable linguistic resources. We would like to be able to process spoken documents with few (if any) resources. Moreover, connecting black boxes in series tends to multiply errors, especially when the key terms are out-ofvocabulary (OOV). The proposed alternative applies text processing directly to the speech without a dependency on ASR. The method finds long (∼ 1 sec) repetitions in speech, fainndd scl luostnegrs t∼he 1m sinecto) pseudo-terms (roughly phrases). Document clustering and classification work surprisingly well on pseudoterms; performance on a Switchboard task approaches a baseline using gold standard man- ual transcriptions.</p><p>5 0.57107621 <a title="7-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Multi-Pass_Sieve_for_Coreference_Resolution.html">8 emnlp-2010-A Multi-Pass Sieve for Coreference Resolution</a></p>

<p>Author: Dominic Espinosa ; Rajakrishnan Rajkumar ; Michael White ; Shoshana Berleant</p><p>Abstract: We present the first evaluation of the utility of automatic evaluation metrics on surface realizations of Penn Treebank data. Using outputs of the OpenCCG and XLE realizers, along with ranked WordNet synonym substitutions, we collected a corpus of generated surface realizations. These outputs were then rated and post-edited by human annotators. We evaluated the realizations using seven automatic metrics, and analyzed correlations obtained between the human judgments and the automatic scores. In contrast to previous NLG meta-evaluations, we find that several of the metrics correlate moderately well with human judgments of both adequacy and fluency, with the TER family performing best overall. We also find that all of the metrics correctly predict more than half of the significant systemlevel differences, though none are correct in all cases. We conclude with a discussion ofthe implications for the utility of such metrics in evaluating generation in the presence of variation. A further result of our research is a corpus of post-edited realizations, which will be made available to the research community. 1 Introduction and Background In building surface-realization systems for natural language generation, there is a need for reliable automated metrics to evaluate the output. Unlike in parsing, where there is usually a single goldstandard parse for a sentence, in surface realization there are usually many grammatically-acceptable ways to express the same concept. This parallels the task of evaluating machine-translation (MT) systems: for a given segment in the source language, 564 there are usually several acceptable translations into the target language. As human evaluation of translation quality is time-consuming and expensive, a number of automated metrics have been developed to evaluate the quality of MT outputs. In this study, we investigate whether the metrics developed for MT evaluation tasks can be used to reliably evaluate the outputs of surface realizers, and which of these metrics are best suited to this task. A number of surface realizers have been developed using the Penn Treebank (PTB), and BLEU scores are often reported in the evaluations of these systems. But how useful is BLEU in this context? The original BLEU study (Papineni et al., 2001) scored MT outputs, which are of generally lower quality than grammar-based surface realizations. Furthermore, even for MT systems, the usefulness of BLEU has been called into question (Callison-Burch et al., 2006). BLEU is designed to work with multiple reference sentences, but in treebank realization, there is only a single reference sentence available for comparison. A few other studies have investigated the use of such metrics in evaluating the output of NLG systems, notably (Reiter and Belz, 2009) and (Stent et al., 2005). The former examined the performance of BLEU and ROUGE with computer-generated weather reports, finding a moderate correlation with human fluency judgments. The latter study applied several MT metrics to paraphrase data from Barzilay and Lee’s corpus-based system (Barzilay and Lee, 2003), and found moderate correlations with human adequacy judgments, but little correlation with fluency judgments. Cahill (2009) examined the performance of six MT metrics (including BLEU) in evaluating the output of a LFG-based surface realizer for ProceMedITin,g Ms oasfs thaceh 2u0se1t0ts C,o UnSfAer,e n9c-e1 on O Ectmobpeir ic 2a0l1 M0.e ?tc ho2d0s10 in A Nsastoucira tlio Lnan fogru Cagoem Ppruotcaetisosninagl, L pinag eusis 5t6ic4s–574, German, also finding only weak correlations with the human judgments. To study the usefulness of evaluation metrics such as BLEU on the output of grammar-based surface realizers used with the PTB, we assembled a corpus of surface realizations from three different realizers operating on Section 00 of the PTB. Two human judges evaluated the adequacy and fluency of each of the realizations with respect to the reference sentence. The realizations were then scored with a number of automated evaluation metrics developed for machine translation. In order to investigate the correlation of targeted metrics with human evaluations, and gather other acceptable realizations for future evaluations, the judges manually repaired each unacceptable realization during the rating task. In contrast to previous NLG meta-evaluations, we found that several of the metrics correlate moderately well with human judgments of both adequacy and fluency, with the TER family performing best. However, when looking at statistically significant system-level differences in human judgments, we found that some of the metrics get some of the rankings correct, but none get them all correct, with different metrics making different ranking errors. This suggests that multiple metrics should be routinely consulted when comparing realizer systems. Overall, our methodology is similar to that of previous MT meta-evaluations, in that we collected human judgments of system outputs, and compared these scores with those assigned by automatic metrics. A recent alternative approach to paraphrase evaluation is ParaMetric (Callison-Burch et al., 2008); however, it requires a corpus of annotated (aligned) paraphrases (which does not yet exist for PTB data), and is arguably focused more on paraphrase analysis than paraphrase generation. The plan of the paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses the preparation of the corpus of surface realizations. Section 3 describes the human evaluation task and the automated metrics applied. Sections 4 and 5 present and discuss the results of these evaluations. We conclude with some general observations about automatic evaluation of surface realizers, and some directions for further research. 565 2 Data Preparation We collected realizations of the sentences in Section 00 of the WSJ corpus from the following three sources: 1. OpenCCG, a CCG-based chart realizer (White, 2006) 2. The XLE Generator, a LFG-based system developed by Xerox PARC (Crouch et al., 2008) 3. WordNet synonym substitutions, to investigate how differences in lexical choice compare to grammar-based variation.1 Although all three systems used Section 00 of the PTB, they were applied with various parameters (e.g., language models, multiple-output versus single-output) and on different input structures. Accordingly, our study does not compare OpenCCG to XLE, or either of these to the WordNet system. 2.1 OpenCCG realizations OpenCCG is an open source parsing/realization library with multimodal extensions to CCG (Baldridge, 2002). The OpenCCG chart realizer takes logical forms as input and produces strings by combining signs for lexical items. Alternative realizations are scored using integrated n-gram and perceptron models. For robustness, fragments are greedily assembled when necessary. Realizations were generated from 1,895 gold standard logical forms, created by constrained parsing of development-section derivations. The following OpenCCG models (which differ essentially in the way the output is ranked) were used: 1. Baseline 1: Output ranked by a trigram word model 2. Baseline 2: Output ranked using three language models (3-gram words 3-gram words with named entity class replacement factored language model of words, POS tags and CCG supertags) + + 1Not strictly surface realizations, since they do not involve an abstract input specification, but for simplicity we refer to them as realizations throughout. 3. Baseline 3: Perceptron with syntax features and the three LMs mentioned above 4. Perceptron full-model: n-best realizations ranked using perceptron with syntax features and the three n-gram models, as well as discriminative n-grams The perceptron model was trained on sections 0221 of the CCGbank, while a grammar extracted from section 00-21 was used for realization. In addition, oracle supertags were inserted into the chart during realization. The purpose of such a non-blind testing strategy was to evaluate the quality of the output produced by the statistical ranking models in isolation, rather than focusing on grammar coverage, and avoid the problems associated with lexical smoothing, i.e. lexical categories in the development section not being present in the training section. To enrich the variation in the generated realizations, dative-alternation was enforced during realization by ensuring alternate lexical categories of the verb in question, as in the following example: (1) the executives gave [the chefs] [a standing ovation] (2) the executives gave [a standing ovation] [to the chefs] 2.2 XLE realizations The corpus of realizations generated by the XLE system contained 42,527 surface realizations of approximately 1,421 section 00 sentences (an average of 30 per sentence), initially unranked. The LFG f-structures used as input to the XLE generator were derived from automatic parses, as described in (Riezler et al., 2002). The realizations were first tokenized using Penn Treebank conventions, then ranked using perplexities calculated from the same trigram word model used with OpenCCG. For each sentence, the top 4 realizations were selected. The XLE generator provides an interesting point of comparison to OpenCCG as it uses a manuallydeveloped grammar with inputs that are less abstract but potentially noisier, as they are derived from automatic parses rather than gold-standard ones. 566 2.3 WordNet synonymizer To produce an additional source of variation, the nouns and verbs of the sentences in section 00 of the PTB were replaced with all of their WordNet synonyms. Verb forms were generated using verb stems, part-of-speech tags, and the morphg tool.2 These substituted outputs were then filtered using the n-gram data which Google Inc. has made available.3 Those without any 5-gram matches centered on the substituted word (or 3-gram matches, in the case of short sentences) were eliminated. 3 Evaluation From the data sources described in the previous sec- tion, a corpus of realizations to be evaluated by the human judges was constructed by randomly choosing 305 sentences from section 00, then selecting surface realizations of these sentences using the following algorithm: 1. Add OpenCCG’s best-scored realization. 2. Add other OpenCCG realizations until all four models are represented, to a maximum of 4. 3. Add up to 4 realizations from either the XLE system or the WordNet pool, chosen randomly. The intent was to give reasonable coverage of all realizer systems discussed in Section 2 without overloading the human judges. “System” here means any instantiation that emits surface realizations, including various configurations of OpenCCG (using different language models or ranking systems), and these can be multiple-output, such as an n-best list, or single-output (best-only, worst-only, etc.). Accordingly, more realizations were selected from the OpenCCG realizer because 5 different systems were being represented. Realizations were chosen randomly, rather than according to sentence types or other criteria, in order to produce a representative sample of the corpus. In total, 2,114 realizations were selected for evaluation. 2http : //www. informatics . sussex. ac .uk/ re search/ groups / nlp / carro l /morph .html l 3http : //www . ldc . upenn .edu/Catalog/docs/ LDC2 0 0 6T 13 / readme .txt 3.1 Human judgments Two human judges evaluated each surface realization on two criteria: adequacy, which represents the extent to which the output conveys all and only the meaning of the reference sentence; and fluency, the extent to which it is grammatically acceptable. The realizations were presented to the judges in sets containing a reference sentence and the 1-8 outputs selected for that sentence. To aid in the evaluation of adequacy, one sentence each of leading and trailing context were displayed. Judges used the guidelines given in Figure 1, based on the scales developed by the NIST Machine Translation Evaluation Workshop. In addition to rating each realization on the two five-point scales, each judge also repaired each output which he or she did not judge to be fully adequate and fluent. An example is shown in Figure 2. These repairs resulted in new reference sentences for a substantial number of sentences. These repaired realizations were later used to calculate targeted versions of the evaluation metrics, i.e., using the repaired sentence as the reference sentence. Although targeted metrics are not fully automatic, they are of interest because they allow the evaluation algorithm to focus on what is actually wrong with the input, rather than all textual differences. Notably, targeted TER (HTER) has been shown to be more consistent with human judgments than human annotators are with one another (Snover et al., 2006). 3.2 Automatic evaluation The realizations were also evaluated using seven automatic metrics: • IBM’s BLEU, which scores a hypothesis by counting n-gram matches with the reference sentence (Papineni et al., 2001), with smoothing as described in (Lin and Och, 2004) • • • • • • The NIST n-gram evaluation metric, similar to BLEU, but rewarding rarer n-gram matches, and using a different length penalty METEOR, which measures the harmonic mean of unigram precision and recall, with a higher weight for recall (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) 567 TER (Translation Edit Rate), a measure of the number of edits required to transform a hypothesis sentence into the reference sentence (Snover et al., 2006) TERP, an augmented version of TER which performs phrasal substitutions, stemming, and checks for synonyms, among other improvements (Snover et al., 2009) TERPA, an instantiation of TERP with edit weights optimized for correlation with adequacy in MT evaluations GTM (General Text Matcher), a generaliza- tion of the F-measure that rewards contiguous matching spans (Turian et al., 2003) Additionally, targeted versions of BLEU, METEOR, TER, and GTM were computed by using the human-repaired outputs as the reference set. The human repair was different from the reference sentence in 193 cases (about 9% of the total), and we expected this to result in better scores and correlations with the human judgments overall. 4 Results 4.1 Human judgments Table 1 summarizes the dataset, as well as the mean adequacy and fluency scores garnered from the human evaluation. Overall adequacy and fluency judgments were high (4.16, 3.63) for the realizer systems on average, and the best-rated realizer systems achieved mean fluency scores above 4. 4.2 Inter-annotator agreement Inter-annotator agreement was measured using the κ-coefficient, which is commonly used to measure the extent to which annotators agree in category P(1A−)P−(PE()E), judgment tasks. κ is defined as where P(A) is the observed agreement 1 b−etPw(eEe)n annotators and P(E) is the probability of agreement due to chance (Carletta, 1996). Chance agreement for this data is calculated by the method discussed in Carletta’s squib. However, in previous work in MT meta-evaluation, Callison-Burch et al. (2007), assume the less strict criterion of uniform chance agreement, i.e. for a five-point scale. They also 51 Score Adequacy Fluency 5All the meaning of the referencePerfectly grammatical 4 Most of the meaning Awkward or non-native; punctuation errors 3 Much of the meaning Agreement errors or minor syntactic problems 2 Meaning substantially different Major syntactic problems, such as missing words 1 Meaning completely different Completely ungrammatical Figure Ref.

The κ scores of0.60 for adequacy and 0.63 for fluency across the entire dataset represent “substantial” agreement, according to the guidelines discussed in (Landis and Koch, 1977), better than is typically reported for machine translation evaluation tasks; for example, Callison-Burch et al. (2007) reported “fair” agreement, with κ = 0.281 for fluency and κ = 0.307 for adequacy (relative). Assuming the uniform chance agreement that the previously cited work adopts, our inter-annotator agreements (both absolute and relative) are still higher. This is likely due to the generally high quality of the realizations evaluated, leading to easier judgments. 4.3 Correlation with automatic evaluation To determine how well the automatic evaluation methods described in Section 3 correlate with the human judgments, we averaged the human judgments for adequacy and fluency, respectively, for each of the rated realizations, and then computed both Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between these scores and each of the metrics. Spearman’s correlation makes fewer assumptions about the distribu- tion of the data, but may not reflect a linear rela568 tionship that is actually present. Both are frequently reported in the literature. Due to space constraints, we show only Spearman’s correlation, although the TER family scored slightly better on Pearson’s coefficient, relatively. The results for Spearman’s correlation are given in Table 3. Additionally, the average scores for adequacy and fluency were themselves averaged into a single score, following (Snover et al., 2009), and the Spearman’s correlation of each of the automatic metrics with these scores are given in Table 4. All reported correlations are significant at p < 0.001. 4.4 Bootstrap sampling of correlations For each of the sub-corpora shown in Table 1, we computed confidence intervals for the correlations between adequacy and fluency human scores with selected automatic metrics (BLEU, HBLEU, TER, TERP, and HTER) as described in (Koenh, 2004). We sampled each sub-corpus 1000 times with replace- ment, and calculated correlations between the rankings induced by the human scores and those induced by the metrics for each reference sentence. We then used these coefficients to estimate the confidence interval, after excluding the top 25 and bottom 25 coefficients, following (Lin and Och, 2004). The results of this for the BLEU metric are shown in Table 5. We determined which correlations lay within the 95% confidence interval of the best performing metric in each row of Table Table 3; these figures are italicized. 5 Discussion 5.1 Human judgments of systems The results for the four OpenCCG perceptron models mostly confirm those reported in (White and Rajkumar, 2009), with one exception: the B-3 model was below B-2, though the P-B (perceptron-best) model still scored highest. This may have been due to differences in the testing scenario. None of the differences in adequacy scores among the individual systems are significant, with the exception of the WordNet system. In this case, the lack of wordsense disambiguation for the substituted words results in a poor overall adequacy score (e.g., wage floor → wage story). Conversely, it scores highest ffoloro fluency, as substituting a noun or tve srcbo rwesith h a synonym does not usually introduce ungrammaticality. 5.2 Correlations of human judgments with MT metrics Of the non-human-targeted metrics evaluated, BLEU and TER/TERP demonstrate the highest correlations with the human judgments of fluency (r = 0.62, 0.64). The TER family of evaluation metrics have been observed to perform very well in MTevaluation tasks, and although the data evaluated here differs from typical MT data in some important ways, the correlation of TERP with the human judgments is substantial. In contrast with previous MT evaluations where TERP performs considerably better than TER, these scored close to equal on our data, possibly because TERP’s stem, synonym, and paraphrase matching are less useful when most of the variation is syntactic. The correlations with BLEU and METEOR are lower than those reported in (Callison-Burch et al., 2007); in that study, BLEU achieved adequacy and fluency correlations of 0.690 and 0.722, respectively, and METEOR achieved 0.701 and 0.719. The correlations for these metrics might be expected to be lower for our data, since overall quality is higher, making the metrics’ task more difficult as the outputs involve subtler differences between acceptable and unacceptable variation. The human-targeted metrics (represented by the prefixed H in the data tables) correlated even more strongly with the human judgments, compared to the non-targeted versions. HTER demonstrated the best 569 correlation with realizer fluency (r = 0.75). For several kinds of acceptable variation involving the rearrangement of constituents (such as dative shift), TERP gives a more reasonable score than BLEU, due to its ability to directly evaluate phrasal shifts. The following realization was rated 4.5 for fluency, and was more correctly ranked by TERP than BLEU: (3) Ref: The deal also gave Mitsui access to a high-tech medical product. (4) Realiz.: The deal also gave access to a high-tech medical product to Mitsui. For each reference sentence, we compared the ranking of its realizations induced from the human scores to the ranking induced from the TERP score, and counted the rank errors by the latter, informally categorizing them by error type (see Table 7). In the 50 sentences with the highest numbers of rank errors, 17 were affected by punctuation differences, typically involving variation in comma placement. Human fluency judgments of outputs with only punctuation problems were generally high, and many realizations with commas inserted or removed were rated fully fluent by the annotators. However, TERP penalizes such insertions or deletions. Agreement errors are another frequent source of ranking errors for TERP. The human judges tended to harshly penalize sentences with number-agreement or tense errors, whereas TERP applies only a single substitution penalty for each such error. We expect that with suitable optimization of edit weights to avoid over-penalizing punctuation shifts and underpenalizing agreement errors, TERP would exhibit an even stronger correlation with human fluency judgments. None of the evaluation metrics can distinguish an acceptable movement of a word or constituent from an unacceptable movement, with only one reference sentence. A substantial source of error for both TERP and BLEU is variation in adverbial placement, as shown in (7). Similar errors are seen with prepositional phrases and some commonly-occurring temporal adverbs, which typically admit a number of variations in placement. Another important example of acceptable variation which these metrics do not generally rank correctly is dative alternation: Ref. We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it. Realiz. Flu.

When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time , she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave students the answers. The correlations of each of the metrics with the human judgments of fluency for the realizer systems indicate at least a moderate relationship, in contrast with the results reported in (Stent et al., 2005) for paraphrase data, which found an inverse correlation for fluency, and (Cahill, 2009) for the output ofa surface realizer for German, which found only a weak correlation. However, the former study employed a corpus-based paraphrase generation system rather than grammar-driven surface realizers, and the resulting paraphrases exhibited much broader variation. In Cahill’s study, the outputs of the realizer were almost always grammatically correct, and the automated evaluation metrics were ranking markedness instead of grammatical acceptability. 5.3 System-level comparisons In order to investigate the efficacy of the metrics in ranking different realizer systems, or competing realizations from the same system generated using different ranking models, we considered seven different “systems” from the whole dataset of realizations. These consisted of five OpenCCG-based realizations (the best realization from three baseline models, and the best and the worst realization from the full perceptron model), and two XLE-based sys- tems (the best and the worst realization, after ranking the outputs of the XLE realizer with an n-gram model). The mean of the combined adequacy and 570 3 0.103 0.346 fluency scores of each of these seven systems was compared with that of every other system, resulting in 21 pairwise comparisons. Then Tukey’s HSD test was performed to determine the systems which differed significantly in terms of the average adequacy and fluency rating they received.4 The test revealed five pairwise comparisons where the scores were significantly different. Subsequently, for each of these systems, an overall system-level score for each of the MT metrics was calculated. For the five pairwise comparisons where the adequacy-fluency group means differed significantly, we checked whether the metric ranked the systems correctly. Table 8 shows the results of a pairwise comparison between the ranking induced by each evaluation metric, and the ranking induced by the human judgments. Five of the seven non- targeted metrics correctly rank more than half of the systems. NIST, METEOR, and GTM get the most comparisons right, but neither NIST nor GTM correctly rank the OpenCCG-baseline model 1 with respect to the XLE-best model. TER and TERP get two of the five comparisons correct, and they incorrectly rank two of the five OpenCCG model comparisons, as well as the comparison between the XLE-worst and OpenCCG-best systems. For the targeted metrics, HNIST is correct for all five comparisons, while neither HBLEU nor HMETEOR correctly rank all the OpenCCG models. On the other hand, HTER and HGTM incorrectly rank the XLE-best system versus OpenCCG-based models. In summary, some of the metrics get some of the rankings correct, but none of the non-targeted metrics get all of them correct. Moreover, different metrics make different ranking errors. This argues for 4This particular test was chosen since it corrects for multiple post-hoc analyses conducted on the same data-set. the use of multiple metrics in comparing realizer systems. 6 Conclusion Our study suggests that although the task of evaluating the output from realizer systems differs from the task of evaluating machine translations, the automatic metrics used to evaluate MT outputs deliver moderate correlations with combined human fluency and adequacy scores when used on surface realizations. We also found that the MT-evaluation metrics are useful in evaluating different versions of the same realizer system (e.g., the various OpenCCG realization ranking models), and finding cases where a system is performing poorly. As in MT-evaluation tasks, human-targeted metrics have the highest correlations with human judgments overall. These results suggest that the MT-evaluation metrics are useful for developing surface realizers. However, the correlations are lower than those reported for MT data, suggesting that they should be used with caution, especially for cross-system evaluation, where consulting multiple metrics may yield more reliable comparisons. In our study, the targeted version of TERP correlated most strongly with human judgments of fluency. In future work, the performance of the TER family of metrics on this data might be improved by opti- mizing the edit weights used in computing its scores, so as to avoid over-penalizing punctuation movements or under-penalizing agreement errors, both of which were significant sources of ranking errors. Multiple reference sentences may also help mitigate these problems, and the corpus of human-repaired realizations that has resulted from our study is a step in this direction, as it provides multiple references for some cases. We expect the corpus to also prove useful for feature engineering and error analysis in developing better realization models.5 Acknowledgements We thank Aoife Cahill and Tracy King for providing us with the output of the XLE generator.

<p>Author: Georgiana Dinu ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: The computation of meaning similarity as operationalized by vector-based models has found widespread use in many tasks ranging from the acquisition of synonyms and paraphrases to word sense disambiguation and textual entailment. Vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation and thus best suited for measuring similarity out of context. In his paper we propose a probabilistic framework for measuring similarity in context. Central to our approach is the intuition that word meaning is represented as a probability distribution over a set of latent senses and is modulated by context. Experimental results on lexical substitution and word similarity show that our algorithm outperforms previously proposed models.</p><p>4 0.48340696 <a title="7-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Enhancing_Domain_Portability_of_Chinese_Segmentation_Model_Using_Chi-Square_Statistics_and_Bootstrapping.html">43 emnlp-2010-Enhancing Domain Portability of Chinese Segmentation Model Using Chi-Square Statistics and Bootstrapping</a></p>
<p>Author: Baobao Chang ; Dongxu Han</p><p>Abstract: Almost all Chinese language processing tasks involve word segmentation of the language input as their first steps, thus robust and reliable segmentation techniques are always required to make sure those tasks wellperformed. In recent years, machine learning and sequence labeling models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are often used in segmenting Chinese texts. Compared with traditional lexicon-driven models, machine learned models achieve higher F-measure scores. But machine learned models heavily depend on training materials. Although they can effectively process texts from the same domain as the training texts, they perform relatively poorly when texts from new domains are to be processed. In this paper, we propose to use χ2 statistics when training an SVM-HMM based segmentation model to im- prove its ability to recall OOV words and then use bootstrapping strategies to maintain its ability to recall IV words. Experiments show the approach proposed in this paper enhances the domain portability of the Chinese word segmentation model and prevents drastic decline in performance when processing texts across domains.</p><p>5 0.47822127 <a title="7-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Minimum_Error_Rate_Training_by_Sampling_the_Translation_Lattice.html">78 emnlp-2010-Minimum Error Rate Training by Sampling the Translation Lattice</a></p>
<p>Author: Samidh Chatterjee ; Nicola Cancedda</p><p>Abstract: Minimum Error Rate Training is the algorithm for log-linear model parameter training most used in state-of-the-art Statistical Machine Translation systems. In its original formulation, the algorithm uses N-best lists output by the decoder to grow the Translation Pool that shapes the surface on which the actual optimization is performed. Recent work has been done to extend the algorithm to use the entire translation lattice built by the decoder, instead of N-best lists. We propose here a third, intermediate way, consisting in growing the translation pool using samples randomly drawn from the translation lattice. We empirically measure a systematic im- provement in the BLEU scores compared to training using N-best lists, without suffering the increase in computational complexity associated with operating with the whole lattice.</p><p>6 0.47456396 <a title="7-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Holistic_Sentiment_Analysis_Across_Languages%3A_Multilingual_Supervised_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">58 emnlp-2010-Holistic Sentiment Analysis Across Languages: Multilingual Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>

<p>Author: Amarnag Subramanya ; Slav Petrov ; Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new scalable algorithm for semi-supervised training of conditional random fields (CRF) and its application to partof-speech (POS) tagging. The algorithm uses a similarity graph to encourage similar ngrams to have similar POS tags. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a domain adaptation task, where we assume that we have access to large amounts of unlabeled data from the target domain, but no additional labeled data. The similarity graph is used during training to smooth the state posteriors on the target domain. Standard inference can be used at test time. Our approach is able to scale to very large problems and yields significantly improved target domain accuracy.</p><p>4 0.065683737 <a title="11-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Nouns_are_Vectors%2C_Adjectives_are_Matrices%3A_Representing_Adjective-Noun_Constructions_in_Semantic_Space.html">87 emnlp-2010-Nouns are Vectors, Adjectives are Matrices: Representing Adjective-Noun Constructions in Semantic Space</a></p>
<p>Author: Marco Baroni ; Roberto Zamparelli</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to adjective-noun composition (AN) for corpus-based distributional semantics that, building on insights from theoretical linguistics, represents nouns as vectors and adjectives as data-induced (linear) functions (encoded as matrices) over nominal vectors. Our model significantly outperforms the rivals on the task of reconstructing AN vectors not seen in training. A small post-hoc analysis further suggests that, when the model-generated AN vector is not similar to the corpus-observed AN vector, this is due to anomalies in the latter. We show moreover that our approach provides two novel ways to represent adjective meanings, alternative to its representation via corpus-based co-occurrence vectors, both outperforming the latter in an adjective clustering task.</p><p>5 0.065216705 <a title="11-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-The_Necessity_of_Combining_Adaptation_Methods.html">104 emnlp-2010-The Necessity of Combining Adaptation Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming-Wei Chang ; Michael Connor ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Problems stemming from domain adaptation continue to plague the statistical natural language processing community. There has been continuing work trying to find general purpose algorithms to alleviate this problem. In this paper we argue that existing general purpose approaches usually only focus on one of two issues related to the difficulties faced by adaptation: 1) difference in base feature statistics or 2) task differences that can be detected with labeled data. We argue that it is necessary to combine these two classes of adaptation algorithms, using evidence collected through theoretical analysis and simulated and real-world data experiments. We find that the combined approach often outperforms the individual adaptation approaches. By combining simple approaches from each class of adaptation algorithm, we achieve state-of-the-art results for both Named Entity Recognition adaptation task and the Preposition Sense Disambiguation adaptation task. Second, we also show that applying an adaptation algorithm that finds shared representation between domains often impacts the choice in adaptation algorithm that makes use of target labeled data.</p><p>6 0.059432998 <a title="11-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Cross_Language_Text_Classification_by_Model_Translation_and_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">33 emnlp-2010-Cross Language Text Classification by Model Translation and Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

Recently, researchers have begun exploring methods of scoring essays with respect to particular dimensions of quality such as coherence, technical errors, and relevance to prompt, but there is relatively little work on modeling organization. We present a new annotated corpus and propose heuristic-based and learning-based approaches to scoring essays along the organization dimension, utilizing techniques that involve sequence alignment, alignment kernels, and string kernels.</p><p>3 0.33327129 <a title="11-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Incorporating_Content_Structure_into_Text_Analysis_Applications.html">64 emnlp-2010-Incorporating Content Structure into Text Analysis Applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Stefan Schoenmackers ; Jesse Davis ; Oren Etzioni ; Daniel Weld</p><p>Abstract: input. Even the entire Web corpus does not explicitly answer all questions, yet inference can uncover many implicit answers. But where do inference rules come from? This paper investigates the problem of learning inference rules from Web text in an unsupervised, domain-independent manner. The SHERLOCK system, described herein, is a first-order learner that acquires over 30,000 Horn clauses from Web text. SHERLOCK embodies several innovations, including a novel rule scoring function based on Statistical Relevance (Salmon et al., 1971) which is effective on ambiguous, noisy and incomplete Web extractions. Our experiments show that inference over the learned rules discovers three times as many facts (at precision 0.8) as the TEXTRUNNER system which merely extracts facts explicitly stated in Web text.</p><p>3 0.43315926 <a title="11-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Unsupervised_Parse_Selection_for_HPSG.html">114 emnlp-2010-Unsupervised Parse Selection for HPSG</a></p>
<p>Author: Rebecca Dridan ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: Parser disambiguation with precision grammars generally takes place via statistical ranking of the parse yield of the grammar using a supervised parse selection model. In the standard process, the parse selection model is trained over a hand-disambiguated treebank, meaning that without a significant investment of effort to produce the treebank, parse selection is not possible. Furthermore, as treebanking is generally streamlined with parse selection models, creating the initial treebank without a model requires more resources than subsequent treebanks. In this work, we show that, by taking advantage of the constrained nature of these HPSG grammars, we can learn a discriminative parse selection model from raw text in a purely unsupervised fashion. This allows us to bootstrap the treebanking process and provide better parsers faster, and with less resources.</p><p>4 0.42789099 <a title="11-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-What%27s_with_the_Attitude%3F_Identifying_Sentences_with_Attitude_in_Online_Discussions.html">120 emnlp-2010-What's with the Attitude? Identifying Sentences with Attitude in Online Discussions</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Vahed Qazvinian ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: Mining sentiment from user generated content is a very important task in Natural Language Processing. An example of such content is threaded discussions which act as a very important tool for communication and collaboration in the Web. Threaded discussions include e-mails, e-mail lists, bulletin boards, newsgroups, and Internet forums. Most of the work on sentiment analysis has been centered around finding the sentiment toward products or topics. In this work, we present a method to identify the attitude of participants in an online discussion toward one another. This would enable us to build a signed network representation of participant interaction where every edge has a sign that indicates whether the interaction is positive or negative. This is different from most of the research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive links. The method is exper- imentally tested using a manually labeled set of discussion posts. The results show that the proposed method is capable of identifying attitudinal sentences, and their signs, with high accuracy and that it outperforms several other baselines.</p><p>5 0.42732498 <a title="11-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Multi-Pass_Sieve_for_Coreference_Resolution.html">8 emnlp-2010-A Multi-Pass Sieve for Coreference Resolution</a></p>

This approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. Each tier builds on the previous tier’s entity cluster output. Further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. This cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. The framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. In spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. This suggests that sievebased approaches could be applied to other NLP tasks.</p><p>6 0.42664599 <a title="11-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based_Stratified_Seed_Sampling_for_Semi-Supervised_Relation_Classification.html">27 emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based Stratified Seed Sampling for Semi-Supervised Relation Classification</a></p>

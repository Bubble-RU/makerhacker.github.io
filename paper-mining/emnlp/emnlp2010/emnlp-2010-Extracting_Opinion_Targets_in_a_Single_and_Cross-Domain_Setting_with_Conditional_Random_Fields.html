<p>Author: Xin Zhao ; Jing Jiang ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Discovering and summarizing opinions from online reviews is an important and challenging task. A commonly-adopted framework generates structured review summaries with aspects and opinions. Recently topic models have been used to identify meaningful review aspects, but existing topic models do not identify aspect-specific opinion words. In this paper, we propose a MaxEnt-LDA hybrid model to jointly discover both aspects and aspect-specific opinion words. We show that with a relatively small amount of training data, our model can effectively identify aspect and opinion words simultaneously. We also demonstrate the domain adaptability of our model.</p><p>3 0.12338294 <a title="49-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Multi-Level_Structured_Models_for_Document-Level_Sentiment_Classification.html">83 emnlp-2010-Multi-Level Structured Models for Document-Level Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Yisong Yue ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate structured models for document-level sentiment classification. When predicting the sentiment of a subjective document (e.g., as positive or negative), it is well known that not all sentences are equally discriminative or informative. But identifying the useful sentences automatically is itself a difficult learning problem. This paper proposes a joint two-level approach for document-level sentiment classification that simultaneously extracts useful (i.e., subjec- tive) sentences and predicts document-level sentiment based on the extracted sentences. Unlike previous joint learning methods for the task, our approach (1) does not rely on gold standard sentence-level subjectivity annotations (which may be expensive to obtain), and (2) optimizes directly for document-level performance. Empirical evaluations on movie reviews and U.S. Congressional floor debates show improved performance over previous approaches.</p><p>4 0.11413224 <a title="49-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Efficient_Graph-Based_Semi-Supervised_Learning_of_Structured_Tagging_Models.html">41 emnlp-2010-Efficient Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning of Structured Tagging Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Amarnag Subramanya ; Slav Petrov ; Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new scalable algorithm for semi-supervised training of conditional random fields (CRF) and its application to partof-speech (POS) tagging. The algorithm uses a similarity graph to encourage similar ngrams to have similar POS tags. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a domain adaptation task, where we assume that we have access to large amounts of unlabeled data from the target domain, but no additional labeled data. The similarity graph is used during training to smooth the state posteriors on the target domain. Standard inference can be used at test time. Our approach is able to scale to very large problems and yields significantly improved target domain accuracy.</p><p>5 0.11412274 <a title="49-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Incorporating_Content_Structure_into_Text_Analysis_Applications.html">64 emnlp-2010-Incorporating Content Structure into Text Analysis Applications</a></p>

This follows the linguistic intuition that rich contextual information should be useful in these tasks. We present a framework which combines a supervised text analysis application with the induction of latent content structure. Both of these elements are learned jointly using the EM algorithm. The induced content structure is learned from a large unannotated corpus and biased by the underlying text analysis task. We demonstrate that exploiting content structure yields significant improvements over approaches that rely only on local context.1</p><p>6 0.1066861 <a title="49-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-What%27s_with_the_Attitude%3F_Identifying_Sentences_with_Attitude_in_Online_Discussions.html">120 emnlp-2010-What's with the Attitude?

<p>Author: Michael Paul ; ChengXiang Zhai ; Roxana Girju</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a two-stage approach to summarizing multiple contrastive viewpoints in opinionated text. In the first stage, we use an unsupervised probabilistic approach to model and extract multiple viewpoints in text. We experiment with a variety of lexical and syntactic features, yielding significant performance gains over bag-of-words feature sets. In the second stage, we introduce Comparative LexRank, a novel random walk formulation to score sentences and pairs of sentences from opposite viewpoints based on both their representativeness of the collection as well as their contrastiveness with each other. Exper- imental results show that the proposed approach can generate informative summaries of viewpoints in opinionated text.</p><p>4 0.32549554 <a title="49-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2010-What%27s_with_the_Attitude%3F_Identifying_Sentences_with_Attitude_in_Online_Discussions.html">120 emnlp-2010-What's with the Attitude? Identifying Sentences with Attitude in Online Discussions</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Vahed Qazvinian ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: Mining sentiment from user generated content is a very important task in Natural Language Processing. An example of such content is threaded discussions which act as a very important tool for communication and collaboration in the Web. Threaded discussions include e-mails, e-mail lists, bulletin boards, newsgroups, and Internet forums. Most of the work on sentiment analysis has been centered around finding the sentiment toward products or topics. In this work, we present a method to identify the attitude of participants in an online discussion toward one another. This would enable us to build a signed network representation of participant interaction where every edge has a sign that indicates whether the interaction is positive or negative. This is different from most of the research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive links. The method is exper- imentally tested using a manually labeled set of discussion posts. The results show that the proposed method is capable of identifying attitudinal sentences, and their signs, with high accuracy and that it outperforms several other baselines.</p><p>5 0.29520446 <a title="49-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Incorporating_Content_Structure_into_Text_Analysis_Applications.html">64 emnlp-2010-Incorporating Content Structure into Text Analysis Applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Ming-Wei Chang ; Michael Connor ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Problems stemming from domain adaptation continue to plague the statistical natural language processing community. There has been continuing work trying to find general purpose algorithms to alleviate this problem. In this paper we argue that existing general purpose approaches usually only focus on one of two issues related to the difficulties faced by adaptation: 1) difference in base feature statistics or 2) task differences that can be detected with labeled data. We argue that it is necessary to combine these two classes of adaptation algorithms, using evidence collected through theoretical analysis and simulated and real-world data experiments. We find that the combined approach often outperforms the individual adaptation approaches. By combining simple approaches from each class of adaptation algorithm, we achieve state-of-the-art results for both Named Entity Recognition adaptation task and the Preposition Sense Disambiguation adaptation task. Second, we also show that applying an adaptation algorithm that finds shared representation between domains often impacts the choice in adaptation algorithm that makes use of target labeled data.</p><p>3 0.9943608 <a title="49-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Training_Continuous_Space_Language_Models%3A_Some_Practical_Issues.html">108 emnlp-2010-Training Continuous Space Language Models: Some Practical Issues</a></p>
<p>Author: Hai Son Le ; Alexandre Allauzen ; Guillaume Wisniewski ; Francois Yvon</p><p>Abstract: Using multi-layer neural networks to estimate the probabilities of word sequences is a promising research area in statistical language modeling, with applications in speech recognition and statistical machine translation. However, training such models for large vocabulary tasks is computationally challenging which does not scale easily to the huge corpora that are nowadays available. In this work, we study the performance and behavior of two neural statistical language models so as to highlight some important caveats of the classical training algorithms. The induced word embeddings for extreme cases are also analysed, thus providing insight into the convergence issues. A new initialization scheme and new training techniques are then introduced. These methods are shown to greatly reduce the training time and to significantly improve performance, both in terms ofperplexity and on a large-scale translation task.</p><p>4 0.96677977 <a title="49-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Two_Decades_of_Unsupervised_POS_Induction%3A_How_Far_Have_We_Come%3F.html">111 emnlp-2010-Two Decades of Unsupervised POS Induction: How Far Have We Come?</a></p>
<p>Author: Christos Christodoulopoulos ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) induction is one of the most popular tasks in research on unsupervised NLP. Many different methods have been proposed, yet comparisons are difficult to make since there is little consensus on evaluation framework, and many papers evaluate against only one or two competitor systems. Here we evaluate seven different POS induction systems spanning nearly 20 years of work, using a variety of measures. We show that some of the oldest (and simplest) systems stand up surprisingly well against more recent approaches. Since most of these systems were developed and tested using data from the WSJ corpus, we compare their generalization abil- ities by testing on both WSJ and the multilingual Multext-East corpus. Finally, we introduce the idea of evaluating systems based on their ability to produce cluster prototypes that are useful as input to a prototype-driven learner. In most cases, the prototype-driven learner outperforms the unsupervised system used to initialize it, yielding state-of-the-art results on WSJ and improvements on nonEnglish corpora.</p><p>5 0.95604938 <a title="49-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Mining_Name_Translations_from_Entity_Graph_Mapping.html">79 emnlp-2010-Mining Name Translations from Entity Graph Mapping</a></p>
<p>Author: Gae-won You ; Seung-won Hwang ; Young-In Song ; Long Jiang ; Zaiqing Nie</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mining entity translation, specifically, mining English and Chinese name pairs. Existing efforts can be categorized into (a) a transliterationbased approach leveraging phonetic similarity and (b) a corpus-based approach exploiting bilingual co-occurrences, each of which suffers from inaccuracy and scarcity respectively. In clear contrast, we use unleveraged resources of monolingual entity co-occurrences, crawled from entity search engines, represented as two entity-relationship graphs extracted from two language corpora respectively. Our problem is then abstracted as finding correct mappings across two graphs. To achieve this goal, we propose a holistic approach, of exploiting both transliteration similarity and monolingual co-occurrences. This approach, building upon monolingual corpora, complements existing corpus-based work, requiring scarce resources of parallel or compa- rable corpus, while significantly boosting the accuracy of transliteration-based work. We validate our proposed system using real-life datasets.</p><p>6 0.93904734 <a title="49-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Semi-Supervised_Approach_to_Improve_Classification_of_Infrequent_Discourse_Relations_Using_Feature_Vector_Extension.html">11 emnlp-2010-A Semi-Supervised Approach to Improve Classification of Infrequent Discourse Relations Using Feature Vector Extension</a></p>

</p><p>7 However, because the latent variable grammars are not explicitly regularized, EM keeps fit12 cal method, making no promises regarding the final point of convergence when initialized from different random seeds. [sent-20, score-0.87]
</p><p>8 Recently, Petrov (2010) showed that substantial differences between the learned grammars remain, even if the hierarchical splitting reduces the variance across independent runs of EM. [sent-21, score-0.734]
</p><p>9 (2006) introduced a linear smoothing procedure that allows training grammars for 6 splitmerge (SM) rounds without overfitting. [sent-23, score-0.895]
</p><p>10 They showed that self-training latent variable grammars on their own output can mitigate data sparsity issues and improve parsing accuracy. [sent-27, score-0.916]
</p><p>11 Because the capacity of the model can grow with the size of the training data, latent variable grammars are able to benefit from the additional training data, even though it is not perfectly labeled. [sent-28, score-0.87]
</p><p>12 However, variation still remains in their self-trained grammars and they had to use a held-out set for model selection. [sent-30, score-0.704]
</p><p>13 What is perhaps more surprising is that the different latent variable grammars seem to capture complementary aspects of the data. [sent-36, score-0.894]
</p><p>14 Quite serendipitously, these grammars can be combined into an unweighted product model that substantially outperforms the individual grammars. [sent-38, score-1.121]
</p><p>15 The  average over  10 SM6 grammars with the transformation is 90. [sent-78, score-0.714]

</p><p>18 Because the individual models’ mistakes are independent to some extent, multiple grammars can be effectively combined into an unweighted product model of much higher accuracy. [sent-141, score-1.121]
</p><p>19 We build upon this line of work and investigate methods to exploit products of latent variable grammars in the context of self-training. [sent-142, score-1.038]

</p><p>23 The resulting grammars can be either used individually or combined in a product model. [sent-163, score-1.019]
</p><p>24 Finally, the third experiment investigates a method for injecting some additional diversity into the individual grammars to determine whether a product model is most successful when there is more variance among the individual models. [sent-167, score-1.388]
</p><p>25 It is important to construct grammars capable of parsing this type of data accurately and consistently in order to support structured language modeling (e. [sent-170, score-0.73]
</p><p>26 4  Newswire Experiments  In this section, we compare single grammars and their products that are trained in the standard way with gold WSJ training data, as well as the three self-training scenarios discussed in Section 3. [sent-173, score-0.853]

</p><p>29 Note that we use 6th round grammars to produce the automatic parse trees for the self-training experiments. [sent-182, score-0.791]
</p><p>30 Parsing with the product of the 7th round grammars is slow and requires a large amount of memory (32GB). [sent-183, score-1.038]
</p><p>31 The best F score attained by the individual SM6 grammars on the development set is 90. [sent-188, score-0.853]
</p><p>32 The product of grammars achieves a significantly improved accuracy at 92. [sent-191, score-1.034]
</p><p>33 Notice that the individual SM7 grammars perform worse on average (90. [sent-193, score-0.816]
</p><p>34 5) due to overfitting, but their product achieves higher accuracy than the product of the SM6 grammars (92. [sent-196, score-1.328]
</p><p>35 2 ST-Reg Training Given the ten SM6 grammars from the previous subsection, we can investigate the three self-training methods. [sent-202, score-0.745]
</p><p>36 We then train ten grammars from different random seeds, using an equally weighted combination of the WSJ training set with this single set. [sent-205, score-0.787]
</p><p>37 These self-trained grammars are then combined into a product model. [sent-206, score-0.999]
</p><p>38 4  Table 4: Performance of the ST-Prod grammars and their products on the WSJ development set. [sent-215, score-0.859]
</p><p>39 thanks to the use of additional automatically labeled training data, the individual SM6 ST-Reg grammars  perform significantly better than the individual SM6 grammars (91. [sent-216, score-1.572]
</p><p>40 5 on average), and the individual SM7 ST-Reg grammars perform even better, achieving a high F score of 91. [sent-219, score-0.805]
</p><p>41 The product of ST-Reg grammars achieves significantly better performance over the individual grammars, however, the improvement is much smaller than that obtained by the product of regular grammars. [sent-221, score-1.687]
</p><p>42 In fact, the product of ST-Reg grammars performs quite similarly to the product of regular grammars despite the higher average accuracy of the individual grammars. [sent-222, score-2.405]
</p><p>43 We will show in Section 5 that the diversity among the individual grammars is as important as average accuracy for the performance attained by the product model. [sent-224, score-1.317]
</p><p>44 3 ST-Prod Training Since products of latent variable grammars perform significantly better than individual latent variable grammars, it is natural to try using the product model for parsing the unlabeled data. [sent-226, score-1.734]
</p><p>45 To investi-  gate whether the higher accuracy of the automatically labeled data translates into a higher accuracy of the self-trained grammars, we used the product of 6th round grammars to parse the same subset of the unlabeled data as in the previous experiment. [sent-227, score-1.233]
</p><p>46 As can be seen in Table 4, using the product of the regular grammars for labeling the self-training data results in improved individual ST-Prod grammars when compared with the STReg grammars, with 0. [sent-229, score-2.051]
</p><p>47 8  Table 5: Performance of the ST-Prod-Mult grammars and their products on the WSJ development set. [sent-239, score-0.859]
</p><p>48 The product of the SM6 ST-Prod grammars also achieves a 0. [sent-243, score-1.004]
</p><p>49 2 higher F score compared to the product of the SM6 ST-Reg grammars, but the product of the SM7 ST-Prod grammars has the same performance as the product of the SM7 ST-Reg grammars. [sent-244, score-1.585]
</p><p>50 This could be due to the fact that the ST-Prod grammars are no more diverse than the ST-Reg grammars, as we will show in Section 5. [sent-245, score-0.684]
</p><p>51 4 ST-Prod-Mult Training When creating a product model of regular grammars, Petrov (2010) used a different random seed for each model and conjectured that the effectiveness of the product grammars stems from the resulting diversity of the individual grammars. [sent-247, score-1.792]
</p><p>52 Petrov (2010) attempted to use the second method to train individual grammars on either disjoint or overlapping subsets of the treebank, but observed a performance drop in individual grammars resulting from training on less data, as well as in the performance of the product model.

</p><p>55 the third self-training experiment, we use the product of the regular grammars to parse all ten subsets of the unlabeled data and train ten grammars, which we call ST-Prod-Mult grammars, each using a different subset. [sent-255, score-1.556]
</p><p>56 As shown in Table 5, the individual ST-Prod-Mult grammars perform similarly to the individual STProd grammars. [sent-256, score-0.888]
</p><p>57 However, the product of the STProd-Mult grammars achieves significantly higher accuracies than the product of the ST-Prod grammars, with 0. [sent-257, score-1.324]
</p><p>58 Figure 1(a) depicts the difference between the product and the individual SM6 regular grammars on  overall F score, as well as individual constituent F scores. [sent-263, score-1.469]
</p><p>59 As can be observed, there are significant 17 variations among the individual grammars, and the product of the regular grammars improves almost all categories, with a few exceptions (some individual grammars do better on QP and WHNP constituents). [sent-264, score-2.178]
</p><p>60 Figure 1(b) shows the difference between the product of the SM6 regular grammars and the individual SM7 ST-Prod-Mult grammars. [sent-265, score-1.367]
</p><p>61 In most of the categories, some individual ST-Prod-Mult grammars perform comparably or slightly better than the product of SM6 regular grammars used to automatically label the unlabeled training set. [sent-267, score-2.179]
</p><p>62 As more latent variables are introduced through the iterative SM training algorithm, the modeling capacity of the grammars increases, leading to improved per-  formance. [sent-271, score-0.792]
</p><p>63 However, the performance of the regular grammars drops after 6 SM rounds, as also previously observed in (Huang and Harper, 2009; Petrov, 2009), suggesting that the regular SM7 grammars have overfit the relatively small-sized gold training data. [sent-272, score-1.984]
</p><p>64 In contrast, the performance of the self-trained grammars continues to improve in the 7th SM round. [sent-273, score-0.684]
</p><p>65 Although the performance of the individual grammars, both regular and self-trained, varies significantly and the product model consistently helps, there is a non-negligible difference between the improvement achieved by the two product models over their component grammars. [sent-275, score-0.977]
</p><p>66 The regular product model improves upon its individual grammars more than the ST-Prod-Mult product does in the later SM rounds, as illustrated by the relative error reduction curves in figures 2(a) and (b). [sent-276, score-1.686]
</p><p>67 In particular, the product of the SM7 regular grammars gains a remarkable 2. [sent-277, score-1.265]
</p><p>68 1% absolute improvement over the average performance of the individual regular SM7 grammars and  0. [sent-278, score-1.103]
</p><p>69 2% absolute over the product of the regular SM6 grammars, despite the fact that the individual regular SM7 grammars perform worse than the SM6 grammars. [sent-279, score-1.654]
</p><p>70 , 2005), each individual expert learns complementary aspects of the training data and the veto power of product models enforces that the joint prediction of their product has to be licensed by all individual experts. [sent-284, score-0.816]
</p><p>71 One possible explanation of the observation in the previous subsection is that with the addition of more latent variables, the individual grammars become more deeply specialized on certain aspects of the training data. [sent-285, score-0.894]
</p><p>72 Petrov (2010) showed that the individually learned grammars are indeed very diverse by looking at the distribution oflatent annotations across the treebank categories, as well as the variation in over18 all and individual category F scores (see Figure 1). [sent-288, score-0.874]

</p><p>75 This happens for coarser grammars produced in early SM stages when there is more uncertainty about what rules to apply, with the rules remaining  in the parsing chart having low probabilities overall. [sent-297, score-0.73]

</p><p>79 This suggests that there is more diversity among the regular grammars than among the self-trained grammars, and explains the greater improvement obtained by the regular product model. [sent-306, score-1.733]
</p><p>80 Last but not the least, the trend seems to indicate that the variance of the self-trained grammars would continue increasing if EM training was extended by a few more SM rounds, potentially resulting in even better product models. [sent-308, score-1.028]

</p><p>83 In contrast to the newswire models, it appears that the individual ST-Prod-Mult grammars trained on broadcast news always perform comparably to the product of the regular grammars at all SM rounds, including the product of SM7 regular grammars. [sent-327, score-2.904]

The product model is most effective when the individual underlying grammars are most diverse.

<p>Author: Adria de Gispert ; Juan Pino ; William Byrne</p><p>Abstract: We report on investigations into hierarchical phrase-based translation grammars based on rules extracted from posterior distributions over alignments of the parallel text. Rather than restrict rule extraction to a single alignment, such as Viterbi, we instead extract rules based on posterior distributions provided by the HMM word-to-word alignmentmodel. We define translation grammars progressively by adding classes of rules to a basic phrase-based system. We assess these grammars in terms of their expressive power, measured by their ability to align the parallel text from which their rules are extracted, and the quality of the translations they yield. In Chinese-to-English translation, we find that rule extraction from posteriors gives translation improvements. We also find that grammars with rules with only one nonterminal, when extracted from posteri- ors, can outperform more complex grammars extracted from Viterbi alignments. Finally, we show that the best way to exploit source-totarget and target-to-source alignment models is to build two separate systems and combine their output translation lattices.</p><p>3 0.14640318 <a title="96-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Unsupervised_Parse_Selection_for_HPSG.html">114 emnlp-2010-Unsupervised Parse Selection for HPSG</a></p>
<p>Author: Rebecca Dridan ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: Parser disambiguation with precision grammars generally takes place via statistical ranking of the parse yield of the grammar using a supervised parse selection model. In the standard process, the parse selection model is trained over a hand-disambiguated treebank, meaning that without a significant investment of effort to produce the treebank, parse selection is not possible. Furthermore, as treebanking is generally streamlined with parse selection models, creating the initial treebank without a model requires more resources than subsequent treebanks. In this work, we show that, by taking advantage of the constrained nature of these HPSG grammars, we can learn a discriminative parse selection model from raw text in a purely unsupervised fashion. This allows us to bootstrap the treebanking process and provide better parsers faster, and with less resources.</p><p>4 0.14029106 <a title="96-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Uptraining_for_Accurate_Deterministic_Question_Parsing.html">115 emnlp-2010-Uptraining for Accurate Deterministic Question Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Slav Petrov ; Pi-Chuan Chang ; Michael Ringgaard ; Hiyan Alshawi</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that parsing accuracies drop significantly on out-of-domain data. What is less known is that some parsers suffer more from domain shifts than others. We show that dependency parsers have more difficulty parsing questions than constituency parsers. In particular, deterministic shift-reduce dependency parsers, which are of highest interest for practical applications because of their linear running time, drop to 60% labeled accuracy on a question test set. We propose an uptraining procedure in which a deterministic parser is trained on the output of a more accurate, but slower, latent variable constituency parser (converted to dependencies). Uptraining with 100K unlabeled questions achieves results comparable to having 2K labeled questions for training. With 100K unlabeled and 2K labeled questions, uptraining is able to improve parsing accuracy to 84%, closing the gap between in-domain and out-of-domain performance.</p><p>5 0.10829654 <a title="96-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Soft_Syntactic_Constraints_for_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation_Using_Latent_Syntactic_Distributions.html">98 emnlp-2010-Soft Syntactic Constraints for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation Using Latent Syntactic Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongqiang Huang ; Martin Cmejrek ; Bowen Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to enhance hierarchical phrase-based machine translation systems with linguistically motivated syntactic features. Rather than directly using treebank categories as in previous studies, we learn a set of linguistically-guided latent syntactic categories automatically from a source-side parsed, word-aligned parallel corpus, based on the hierarchical structure among phrase pairs as well as the syntactic structure of the source side. In our model, each X nonterminal in a SCFG rule is decorated with a real-valued feature vector computed based on its distribution of latent syntactic categories. These feature vectors are utilized at decod- ing time to measure the similarity between the syntactic analysis of the source side and the syntax of the SCFG rules that are applied to derive translations. Our approach maintains the advantages of hierarchical phrase-based translation systems while at the same time naturally incorporates soft syntactic constraints.</p><p>6 0.098485813 <a title="96-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Unsupervised_Induction_of_Tree_Substitution_Grammars_for_Dependency_Parsing.html">113 emnlp-2010-Unsupervised Induction of Tree Substitution Grammars for Dependency Parsing</a></p>

Additionally, we show that multiple self-trained grammars can be combined in a product model to achieve even higher accuracy. The product model is most effective when the individual underlying grammars are most diverse. Combining multiple grammars that were self-trained on disjoint sets of unlabeled data results in a final test accuracy of 92.5% on the WSJ test set and 89.6% on our Broadcast News test set.</p><p>2 0.56800008 <a title="96-lsi-2" href="./emnlp-2010-Unsupervised_Parse_Selection_for_HPSG.html">114 emnlp-2010-Unsupervised Parse Selection for HPSG</a></p>

<p>Author: Dominic Espinosa ; Rajakrishnan Rajkumar ; Michael White ; Shoshana Berleant</p><p>Abstract: We present the first evaluation of the utility of automatic evaluation metrics on surface realizations of Penn Treebank data. Using outputs of the OpenCCG and XLE realizers, along with ranked WordNet synonym substitutions, we collected a corpus of generated surface realizations. These outputs were then rated and post-edited by human annotators. We evaluated the realizations using seven automatic metrics, and analyzed correlations obtained between the human judgments and the automatic scores. In contrast to previous NLG meta-evaluations, we find that several of the metrics correlate moderately well with human judgments of both adequacy and fluency, with the TER family performing best overall. We also find that all of the metrics correctly predict more than half of the significant systemlevel differences, though none are correct in all cases. We conclude with a discussion ofthe implications for the utility of such metrics in evaluating generation in the presence of variation. A further result of our research is a corpus of post-edited realizations, which will be made available to the research community. 1 Introduction and Background In building surface-realization systems for natural language generation, there is a need for reliable automated metrics to evaluate the output. Unlike in parsing, where there is usually a single goldstandard parse for a sentence, in surface realization there are usually many grammatically-acceptable ways to express the same concept. This parallels the task of evaluating machine-translation (MT) systems: for a given segment in the source language, 564 there are usually several acceptable translations into the target language. As human evaluation of translation quality is time-consuming and expensive, a number of automated metrics have been developed to evaluate the quality of MT outputs. In this study, we investigate whether the metrics developed for MT evaluation tasks can be used to reliably evaluate the outputs of surface realizers, and which of these metrics are best suited to this task. A number of surface realizers have been developed using the Penn Treebank (PTB), and BLEU scores are often reported in the evaluations of these systems. But how useful is BLEU in this context? The original BLEU study (Papineni et al., 2001) scored MT outputs, which are of generally lower quality than grammar-based surface realizations. Furthermore, even for MT systems, the usefulness of BLEU has been called into question (Callison-Burch et al., 2006). BLEU is designed to work with multiple reference sentences, but in treebank realization, there is only a single reference sentence available for comparison. A few other studies have investigated the use of such metrics in evaluating the output of NLG systems, notably (Reiter and Belz, 2009) and (Stent et al., 2005). The former examined the performance of BLEU and ROUGE with computer-generated weather reports, finding a moderate correlation with human fluency judgments. The latter study applied several MT metrics to paraphrase data from Barzilay and Lee’s corpus-based system (Barzilay and Lee, 2003), and found moderate correlations with human adequacy judgments, but little correlation with fluency judgments. Cahill (2009) examined the performance of six MT metrics (including BLEU) in evaluating the output of a LFG-based surface realizer for ProceMedITin,g Ms oasfs thaceh 2u0se1t0ts C,o UnSfAer,e n9c-e1 on O Ectmobpeir ic 2a0l1 M0.e ?tc ho2d0s10 in A Nsastoucira tlio Lnan fogru Cagoem Ppruotcaetisosninagl, L pinag eusis 5t6ic4s–574, German, also finding only weak correlations with the human judgments. To study the usefulness of evaluation metrics such as BLEU on the output of grammar-based surface realizers used with the PTB, we assembled a corpus of surface realizations from three different realizers operating on Section 00 of the PTB. Two human judges evaluated the adequacy and fluency of each of the realizations with respect to the reference sentence. The realizations were then scored with a number of automated evaluation metrics developed for machine translation. In order to investigate the correlation of targeted metrics with human evaluations, and gather other acceptable realizations for future evaluations, the judges manually repaired each unacceptable realization during the rating task. In contrast to previous NLG meta-evaluations, we found that several of the metrics correlate moderately well with human judgments of both adequacy and fluency, with the TER family performing best. However, when looking at statistically significant system-level differences in human judgments, we found that some of the metrics get some of the rankings correct, but none get them all correct, with different metrics making different ranking errors. This suggests that multiple metrics should be routinely consulted when comparing realizer systems. Overall, our methodology is similar to that of previous MT meta-evaluations, in that we collected human judgments of system outputs, and compared these scores with those assigned by automatic metrics. A recent alternative approach to paraphrase evaluation is ParaMetric (Callison-Burch et al., 2008); however, it requires a corpus of annotated (aligned) paraphrases (which does not yet exist for PTB data), and is arguably focused more on paraphrase analysis than paraphrase generation. The plan of the paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses the preparation of the corpus of surface realizations. Section 3 describes the human evaluation task and the automated metrics applied. Sections 4 and 5 present and discuss the results of these evaluations. We conclude with some general observations about automatic evaluation of surface realizers, and some directions for further research. 565 2 Data Preparation We collected realizations of the sentences in Section 00 of the WSJ corpus from the following three sources: 1. OpenCCG, a CCG-based chart realizer (White, 2006) 2. The XLE Generator, a LFG-based system developed by Xerox PARC (Crouch et al., 2008) 3. WordNet synonym substitutions, to investigate how differences in lexical choice compare to grammar-based variation.1 Although all three systems used Section 00 of the PTB, they were applied with various parameters (e.g., language models, multiple-output versus single-output) and on different input structures. Accordingly, our study does not compare OpenCCG to XLE, or either of these to the WordNet system. 2.1 OpenCCG realizations OpenCCG is an open source parsing/realization library with multimodal extensions to CCG (Baldridge, 2002). The OpenCCG chart realizer takes logical forms as input and produces strings by combining signs for lexical items. Alternative realizations are scored using integrated n-gram and perceptron models. For robustness, fragments are greedily assembled when necessary. Realizations were generated from 1,895 gold standard logical forms, created by constrained parsing of development-section derivations. The following OpenCCG models (which differ essentially in the way the output is ranked) were used: 1. Baseline 1: Output ranked by a trigram word model 2. Baseline 2: Output ranked using three language models (3-gram words 3-gram words with named entity class replacement factored language model of words, POS tags and CCG supertags) + + 1Not strictly surface realizations, since they do not involve an abstract input specification, but for simplicity we refer to them as realizations throughout. 3. Baseline 3: Perceptron with syntax features and the three LMs mentioned above 4. Perceptron full-model: n-best realizations ranked using perceptron with syntax features and the three n-gram models, as well as discriminative n-grams The perceptron model was trained on sections 0221 of the CCGbank, while a grammar extracted from section 00-21 was used for realization. In addition, oracle supertags were inserted into the chart during realization. The purpose of such a non-blind testing strategy was to evaluate the quality of the output produced by the statistical ranking models in isolation, rather than focusing on grammar coverage, and avoid the problems associated with lexical smoothing, i.e. lexical categories in the development section not being present in the training section. To enrich the variation in the generated realizations, dative-alternation was enforced during realization by ensuring alternate lexical categories of the verb in question, as in the following example: (1) the executives gave [the chefs] [a standing ovation] (2) the executives gave [a standing ovation] [to the chefs] 2.2 XLE realizations The corpus of realizations generated by the XLE system contained 42,527 surface realizations of approximately 1,421 section 00 sentences (an average of 30 per sentence), initially unranked. The LFG f-structures used as input to the XLE generator were derived from automatic parses, as described in (Riezler et al., 2002). The realizations were first tokenized using Penn Treebank conventions, then ranked using perplexities calculated from the same trigram word model used with OpenCCG. For each sentence, the top 4 realizations were selected. The XLE generator provides an interesting point of comparison to OpenCCG as it uses a manuallydeveloped grammar with inputs that are less abstract but potentially noisier, as they are derived from automatic parses rather than gold-standard ones. 566 2.3 WordNet synonymizer To produce an additional source of variation, the nouns and verbs of the sentences in section 00 of the PTB were replaced with all of their WordNet synonyms. Verb forms were generated using verb stems, part-of-speech tags, and the morphg tool.2 These substituted outputs were then filtered using the n-gram data which Google Inc. has made available.3 Those without any 5-gram matches centered on the substituted word (or 3-gram matches, in the case of short sentences) were eliminated. 3 Evaluation From the data sources described in the previous sec- tion, a corpus of realizations to be evaluated by the human judges was constructed by randomly choosing 305 sentences from section 00, then selecting surface realizations of these sentences using the following algorithm: 1. Add OpenCCG’s best-scored realization. 2. Add other OpenCCG realizations until all four models are represented, to a maximum of 4. 3. Add up to 4 realizations from either the XLE system or the WordNet pool, chosen randomly. The intent was to give reasonable coverage of all realizer systems discussed in Section 2 without overloading the human judges. “System” here means any instantiation that emits surface realizations, including various configurations of OpenCCG (using different language models or ranking systems), and these can be multiple-output, such as an n-best list, or single-output (best-only, worst-only, etc.). Accordingly, more realizations were selected from the OpenCCG realizer because 5 different systems were being represented. Realizations were chosen randomly, rather than according to sentence types or other criteria, in order to produce a representative sample of the corpus. In total, 2,114 realizations were selected for evaluation. 2http : //www. informatics . sussex. ac .uk/ re search/ groups / nlp / carro l /morph .html l 3http : //www . ldc . upenn .edu/Catalog/docs/ LDC2 0 0 6T 13 / readme .txt 3.1 Human judgments Two human judges evaluated each surface realization on two criteria: adequacy, which represents the extent to which the output conveys all and only the meaning of the reference sentence; and fluency, the extent to which it is grammatically acceptable. The realizations were presented to the judges in sets containing a reference sentence and the 1-8 outputs selected for that sentence. To aid in the evaluation of adequacy, one sentence each of leading and trailing context were displayed. Judges used the guidelines given in Figure 1, based on the scales developed by the NIST Machine Translation Evaluation Workshop. In addition to rating each realization on the two five-point scales, each judge also repaired each output which he or she did not judge to be fully adequate and fluent. An example is shown in Figure 2. These repairs resulted in new reference sentences for a substantial number of sentences. These repaired realizations were later used to calculate targeted versions of the evaluation metrics, i.e., using the repaired sentence as the reference sentence. Although targeted metrics are not fully automatic, they are of interest because they allow the evaluation algorithm to focus on what is actually wrong with the input, rather than all textual differences. Notably, targeted TER (HTER) has been shown to be more consistent with human judgments than human annotators are with one another (Snover et al., 2006). 3.2 Automatic evaluation The realizations were also evaluated using seven automatic metrics: • IBM’s BLEU, which scores a hypothesis by counting n-gram matches with the reference sentence (Papineni et al., 2001), with smoothing as described in (Lin and Och, 2004) • • • • • • The NIST n-gram evaluation metric, similar to BLEU, but rewarding rarer n-gram matches, and using a different length penalty METEOR, which measures the harmonic mean of unigram precision and recall, with a higher weight for recall (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) 567 TER (Translation Edit Rate), a measure of the number of edits required to transform a hypothesis sentence into the reference sentence (Snover et al., 2006) TERP, an augmented version of TER which performs phrasal substitutions, stemming, and checks for synonyms, among other improvements (Snover et al., 2009) TERPA, an instantiation of TERP with edit weights optimized for correlation with adequacy in MT evaluations GTM (General Text Matcher), a generaliza- tion of the F-measure that rewards contiguous matching spans (Turian et al., 2003) Additionally, targeted versions of BLEU, METEOR, TER, and GTM were computed by using the human-repaired outputs as the reference set. The human repair was different from the reference sentence in 193 cases (about 9% of the total), and we expected this to result in better scores and correlations with the human judgments overall. 4 Results 4.1 Human judgments Table 1 summarizes the dataset, as well as the mean adequacy and fluency scores garnered from the human evaluation. Overall adequacy and fluency judgments were high (4.16, 3.63) for the realizer systems on average, and the best-rated realizer systems achieved mean fluency scores above 4. 4.2 Inter-annotator agreement Inter-annotator agreement was measured using the κ-coefficient, which is commonly used to measure the extent to which annotators agree in category P(1A−)P−(PE()E), judgment tasks. κ is defined as where P(A) is the observed agreement 1 b−etPw(eEe)n annotators and P(E) is the probability of agreement due to chance (Carletta, 1996). Chance agreement for this data is calculated by the method discussed in Carletta’s squib. However, in previous work in MT meta-evaluation, Callison-Burch et al. (2007), assume the less strict criterion of uniform chance agreement, i.e. for a five-point scale. They also 51 Score Adequacy Fluency 5All the meaning of the referencePerfectly grammatical 4 Most of the meaning Awkward or non-native; punctuation errors 3 Much of the meaning Agreement errors or minor syntactic problems 2 Meaning substantially different Major syntactic problems, such as missing words 1 Meaning completely different Completely ungrammatical Figure Ref.

The κ scores of0.60 for adequacy and 0.63 for fluency across the entire dataset represent “substantial” agreement, according to the guidelines discussed in (Landis and Koch, 1977), better than is typically reported for machine translation evaluation tasks; for example, Callison-Burch et al. (2007) reported “fair” agreement, with κ = 0.281 for fluency and κ = 0.307 for adequacy (relative). Assuming the uniform chance agreement that the previously cited work adopts, our inter-annotator agreements (both absolute and relative) are still higher. This is likely due to the generally high quality of the realizations evaluated, leading to easier judgments. 4.3 Correlation with automatic evaluation To determine how well the automatic evaluation methods described in Section 3 correlate with the human judgments, we averaged the human judgments for adequacy and fluency, respectively, for each of the rated realizations, and then computed both Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between these scores and each of the metrics. Spearman’s correlation makes fewer assumptions about the distribu- tion of the data, but may not reflect a linear rela568 tionship that is actually present. Both are frequently reported in the literature. Due to space constraints, we show only Spearman’s correlation, although the TER family scored slightly better on Pearson’s coefficient, relatively. The results for Spearman’s correlation are given in Table 3. Additionally, the average scores for adequacy and fluency were themselves averaged into a single score, following (Snover et al., 2009), and the Spearman’s correlation of each of the automatic metrics with these scores are given in Table 4. All reported correlations are significant at p < 0.001. 4.4 Bootstrap sampling of correlations For each of the sub-corpora shown in Table 1, we computed confidence intervals for the correlations between adequacy and fluency human scores with selected automatic metrics (BLEU, HBLEU, TER, TERP, and HTER) as described in (Koenh, 2004). We sampled each sub-corpus 1000 times with replace- ment, and calculated correlations between the rankings induced by the human scores and those induced by the metrics for each reference sentence. We then used these coefficients to estimate the confidence interval, after excluding the top 25 and bottom 25 coefficients, following (Lin and Och, 2004). The results of this for the BLEU metric are shown in Table 5. We determined which correlations lay within the 95% confidence interval of the best performing metric in each row of Table Table 3; these figures are italicized. 5 Discussion 5.1 Human judgments of systems The results for the four OpenCCG perceptron models mostly confirm those reported in (White and Rajkumar, 2009), with one exception: the B-3 model was below B-2, though the P-B (perceptron-best) model still scored highest. This may have been due to differences in the testing scenario. None of the differences in adequacy scores among the individual systems are significant, with the exception of the WordNet system. In this case, the lack of wordsense disambiguation for the substituted words results in a poor overall adequacy score (e.g., wage floor → wage story). Conversely, it scores highest ffoloro fluency, as substituting a noun or tve srcbo rwesith h a synonym does not usually introduce ungrammaticality. 5.2 Correlations of human judgments with MT metrics Of the non-human-targeted metrics evaluated, BLEU and TER/TERP demonstrate the highest correlations with the human judgments of fluency (r = 0.62, 0.64). The TER family of evaluation metrics have been observed to perform very well in MTevaluation tasks, and although the data evaluated here differs from typical MT data in some important ways, the correlation of TERP with the human judgments is substantial. In contrast with previous MT evaluations where TERP performs considerably better than TER, these scored close to equal on our data, possibly because TERP’s stem, synonym, and paraphrase matching are less useful when most of the variation is syntactic. The correlations with BLEU and METEOR are lower than those reported in (Callison-Burch et al., 2007); in that study, BLEU achieved adequacy and fluency correlations of 0.690 and 0.722, respectively, and METEOR achieved 0.701 and 0.719. The correlations for these metrics might be expected to be lower for our data, since overall quality is higher, making the metrics’ task more difficult as the outputs involve subtler differences between acceptable and unacceptable variation. The human-targeted metrics (represented by the prefixed H in the data tables) correlated even more strongly with the human judgments, compared to the non-targeted versions. HTER demonstrated the best 569 correlation with realizer fluency (r = 0.75). For several kinds of acceptable variation involving the rearrangement of constituents (such as dative shift), TERP gives a more reasonable score than BLEU, due to its ability to directly evaluate phrasal shifts. The following realization was rated 4.5 for fluency, and was more correctly ranked by TERP than BLEU: (3) Ref: The deal also gave Mitsui access to a high-tech medical product. (4) Realiz.: The deal also gave access to a high-tech medical product to Mitsui. For each reference sentence, we compared the ranking of its realizations induced from the human scores to the ranking induced from the TERP score, and counted the rank errors by the latter, informally categorizing them by error type (see Table 7). In the 50 sentences with the highest numbers of rank errors, 17 were affected by punctuation differences, typically involving variation in comma placement. Human fluency judgments of outputs with only punctuation problems were generally high, and many realizations with commas inserted or removed were rated fully fluent by the annotators. However, TERP penalizes such insertions or deletions. Agreement errors are another frequent source of ranking errors for TERP. The human judges tended to harshly penalize sentences with number-agreement or tense errors, whereas TERP applies only a single substitution penalty for each such error. We expect that with suitable optimization of edit weights to avoid over-penalizing punctuation shifts and underpenalizing agreement errors, TERP would exhibit an even stronger correlation with human fluency judgments. None of the evaluation metrics can distinguish an acceptable movement of a word or constituent from an unacceptable movement, with only one reference sentence. A substantial source of error for both TERP and BLEU is variation in adverbial placement, as shown in (7). Similar errors are seen with prepositional phrases and some commonly-occurring temporal adverbs, which typically admit a number of variations in placement. Another important example of acceptable variation which these metrics do not generally rank correctly is dative alternation: Ref. We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it. Realiz. Flu.

When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time , she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave students the answers. The correlations of each of the metrics with the human judgments of fluency for the realizer systems indicate at least a moderate relationship, in contrast with the results reported in (Stent et al., 2005) for paraphrase data, which found an inverse correlation for fluency, and (Cahill, 2009) for the output ofa surface realizer for German, which found only a weak correlation. However, the former study employed a corpus-based paraphrase generation system rather than grammar-driven surface realizers, and the resulting paraphrases exhibited much broader variation. In Cahill’s study, the outputs of the realizer were almost always grammatically correct, and the automated evaluation metrics were ranking markedness instead of grammatical acceptability. 5.3 System-level comparisons In order to investigate the efficacy of the metrics in ranking different realizer systems, or competing realizations from the same system generated using different ranking models, we considered seven different “systems” from the whole dataset of realizations. These consisted of five OpenCCG-based realizations (the best realization from three baseline models, and the best and the worst realization from the full perceptron model), and two XLE-based sys- tems (the best and the worst realization, after ranking the outputs of the XLE realizer with an n-gram model). The mean of the combined adequacy and 570 3 0.103 0.346 fluency scores of each of these seven systems was compared with that of every other system, resulting in 21 pairwise comparisons. Then Tukey’s HSD test was performed to determine the systems which differed significantly in terms of the average adequacy and fluency rating they received.4 The test revealed five pairwise comparisons where the scores were significantly different. Subsequently, for each of these systems, an overall system-level score for each of the MT metrics was calculated. For the five pairwise comparisons where the adequacy-fluency group means differed significantly, we checked whether the metric ranked the systems correctly. Table 8 shows the results of a pairwise comparison between the ranking induced by each evaluation metric, and the ranking induced by the human judgments. Five of the seven non- targeted metrics correctly rank more than half of the systems. NIST, METEOR, and GTM get the most comparisons right, but neither NIST nor GTM correctly rank the OpenCCG-baseline model 1 with respect to the XLE-best model. TER and TERP get two of the five comparisons correct, and they incorrectly rank two of the five OpenCCG model comparisons, as well as the comparison between the XLE-worst and OpenCCG-best systems. For the targeted metrics, HNIST is correct for all five comparisons, while neither HBLEU nor HMETEOR correctly rank all the OpenCCG models. On the other hand, HTER and HGTM incorrectly rank the XLE-best system versus OpenCCG-based models. In summary, some of the metrics get some of the rankings correct, but none of the non-targeted metrics get all of them correct. Moreover, different metrics make different ranking errors. This argues for 4This particular test was chosen since it corrects for multiple post-hoc analyses conducted on the same data-set. the use of multiple metrics in comparing realizer systems. 6 Conclusion Our study suggests that although the task of evaluating the output from realizer systems differs from the task of evaluating machine translations, the automatic metrics used to evaluate MT outputs deliver moderate correlations with combined human fluency and adequacy scores when used on surface realizations. We also found that the MT-evaluation metrics are useful in evaluating different versions of the same realizer system (e.g., the various OpenCCG realization ranking models), and finding cases where a system is performing poorly. As in MT-evaluation tasks, human-targeted metrics have the highest correlations with human judgments overall. These results suggest that the MT-evaluation metrics are useful for developing surface realizers. However, the correlations are lower than those reported for MT data, suggesting that they should be used with caution, especially for cross-system evaluation, where consulting multiple metrics may yield more reliable comparisons. In our study, the targeted version of TERP correlated most strongly with human judgments of fluency. In future work, the performance of the TER family of metrics on this data might be improved by opti- mizing the edit weights used in computing its scores, so as to avoid over-penalizing punctuation movements or under-penalizing agreement errors, both of which were significant sources of ranking errors. Multiple reference sentences may also help mitigate these problems, and the corpus of human-repaired realizations that has resulted from our study is a step in this direction, as it provides multiple references for some cases. We expect the corpus to also prove useful for feature engineering and error analysis in developing better realization models.5 Acknowledgements We thank Aoife Cahill and Tracy King for providing us with the output of the XLE generator.

Our generative self-trained grammars reach F scores of 91.6 on the WSJ test set and surpass even discriminative reranking systems without selftraining. Additionally, we show that multiple self-trained grammars can be combined in a product model to achieve even higher accuracy. The product model is most effective when the individual underlying grammars are most diverse. Combining multiple grammars that were self-trained on disjoint sets of unlabeled data results in a final test accuracy of 92.5% on the WSJ test set and 89.6% on our Broadcast News test set.</p><p>3 0.9567399 <a title="96-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Measuring_Distributional_Similarity_in_Context.html">77 emnlp-2010-Measuring Distributional Similarity in Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgiana Dinu ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: The computation of meaning similarity as operationalized by vector-based models has found widespread use in many tasks ranging from the acquisition of synonyms and paraphrases to word sense disambiguation and textual entailment. Vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation and thus best suited for measuring similarity out of context. In his paper we propose a probabilistic framework for measuring similarity in context. Central to our approach is the intuition that word meaning is represented as a probability distribution over a set of latent senses and is modulated by context. Experimental results on lexical substitution and word similarity show that our algorithm outperforms previously proposed models.</p><p>4 0.95150203 <a title="96-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Simple_Type-Level_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging.html">97 emnlp-2010-Simple Type-Level Unsupervised POS Tagging</a></p>

Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating this sparsity constraint improves tagging accuracy. However, in existing systems, this expansion come with a steep increase in model complexity. This paper proposes a simple and effective tagging method that directly models tag sparsity and other distributional properties of valid POS tag assignments. In addition, this formulation results in a dramatic reduction in the number of model parameters thereby, enabling unusually rapid training. Our experiments consistently demonstrate that this model architecture yields substantial performance gains over more complex tagging — counterparts. On several languages, we report performance exceeding that of more complex state-of-the art systems.1</p><p>5 0.94610274 <a title="96-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_a_Factorized_Grammar.html">99 emnlp-2010-Statistical Machine Translation with a Factorized Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Libin Shen ; Bing Zhang ; Spyros Matsoukas ; Jinxi Xu ; Ralph Weischedel</p><p>Abstract: In modern machine translation practice, a statistical phrasal or hierarchical translation system usually relies on a huge set of translation rules extracted from bi-lingual training data. This approach not only results in space and efficiency issues, but also suffers from the sparse data problem. In this paper, we propose to use factorized grammars, an idea widely accepted in the field of linguistic grammar construction, to generalize translation rules, so as to solve these two problems. We designed a method to take advantage of the XTAG English Grammar to facilitate the extraction of factorized rules. We experimented on various setups of low-resource language translation, and showed consistent significant improvement in BLEU over state-ofthe-art string-to-dependency baseline systems with 200K words of bi-lingual training data.</p><p>6 0.82213426 <a title="96-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-PEM%3A_A_Paraphrase_Evaluation_Metric_Exploiting_Parallel_Texts.html">89 emnlp-2010-PEM: A Paraphrase Evaluation Metric Exploiting Parallel Texts</a></p>

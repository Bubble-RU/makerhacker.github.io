<p>Author: Xiaohua Liu ; Bo Han ; Kuan Li ; Stephan Hyeonjun Stiller ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop an approach to tackle the problem of verb selection for learners of English as a second language (ESL) by using features from the output of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL). Unlike existing approaches to verb selection that use local features such as n-grams, our approach exploits semantic features which explicitly model the usage context of the verb. The verb choice highly depends on its usage context which is not consistently captured by local features. We then combine these semantic features with other local features under the generalized perceptron learning framework. Experiments on both indomain and out-of-domain corpora show that our approach outperforms the baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance. 1</p><p>3 0.10512988 <a title="54-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-The_Necessity_of_Combining_Adaptation_Methods.html">104 emnlp-2010-The Necessity of Combining Adaptation Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming-Wei Chang ; Michael Connor ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Problems stemming from domain adaptation continue to plague the statistical natural language processing community. There has been continuing work trying to find general purpose algorithms to alleviate this problem. In this paper we argue that existing general purpose approaches usually only focus on one of two issues related to the difficulties faced by adaptation: 1) difference in base feature statistics or 2) task differences that can be detected with labeled data. We argue that it is necessary to combine these two classes of adaptation algorithms, using evidence collected through theoretical analysis and simulated and real-world data experiments. We find that the combined approach often outperforms the individual adaptation approaches. By combining simple approaches from each class of adaptation algorithm, we achieve state-of-the-art results for both Named Entity Recognition adaptation task and the Preposition Sense Disambiguation adaptation task. Second, we also show that applying an adaptation algorithm that finds shared representation between domains often impacts the choice in adaptation algorithm that makes use of target labeled data.</p><p>4 0.10135156 <a title="54-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Game-Theoretic_Approach_to_Generating_Spatial_Descriptions.html">4 emnlp-2010-A Game-Theoretic Approach to Generating Spatial Descriptions</a></p>

Specifically, we consider the task of generating spatial references to objects, wherein the listener must accurately identify an object described by the speaker. We show that a speaker model that acts optimally with respect to an explicit, embedded listener model substantially outperforms one that is trained to directly generate spatial descriptions.</p><p>5 0.080663241 <a title="54-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Automatic_Discovery_of_Manner_Relations_and_its_Applications.html">21 emnlp-2010-Automatic Discovery of Manner Relations and its Applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Aida Khemakhem ; Bilel Gargouri ; Abdelmajid Ben Hamadou</p><p>Abstract: Electronic dictionaries covering all natural language levels are very relevant for the human use as well as for the automatic processing use, namely those constructed with respect to international standards. Such dictionaries are characterized by a complex structure and an important access time when using a querying system. However, the need of a user is generally limited to a part of such a dictionary according to his domain and expertise level which corresponds to a specialized dictionary. Given the importance of managing a unified dictionary and considering the personalized needs of users, we propose an approach for generating personalized views starting from a normalized dictionary with respect to Lexical Markup Framework LMF-ISO 24613 norm. This approach provides the re-use of already defined views for a community of users by managing their profiles information and promoting the materialization of the generated views. It is composed of four main steps: (i) the projection of data categories controlled by a set of constraints (related to the user‟s profiles), (ii) the selection of values with consistency checking, (iii) the automatic generation of the query‟s model and finally, (iv) the refinement of the view. The proposed approach was con- solidated by carrying out an experiment on an LMF normalized Arabic dictionary. 1</p><p>2 0.87214899 <a title="54-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2010-Inducing_Probabilistic_CCG_Grammars_from_Logical_Form_with_Higher-Order_Unification.html">65 emnlp-2010-Inducing Probabilistic CCG Grammars from Logical Form with Higher-Order Unification</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowksi ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning to map sentences to logical form, given training data consisting of natural language sentences paired with logical representations of their meaning. Previous approaches have been designed for particular natural languages or specific meaning representations; here we present a more general method. The approach induces a probabilistic CCG grammar that represents the meaning of individual words and defines how these meanings can be combined to analyze complete sentences. We use higher-order unification to define a hypothesis space containing all grammars consistent with the training data, and develop an online learning algorithm that efficiently searches this space while simultaneously estimating the parameters of a log-linear parsing model. Experiments demonstrate high accuracy on benchmark data sets in four languages with two different meaning representations.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.82127255 <a title="54-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Generating_Confusion_Sets_for_Context-Sensitive_Error_Correction.html">54 emnlp-2010-Generating Confusion Sets for Context-Sensitive Error Correction</a></p>

We find that restricting candidates to those that are ob- served in the non-native data improves both the precision and the recall compared to the approach that views all prepositions as possible candidates. Furthermore, the approach that takes into account the likelihood of each preposition confusion is shown to be the most effective.</p><p>4 0.55780876 <a title="54-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Using_Unknown_Word_Techniques_to_Learn_Known_Words.html">117 emnlp-2010-Using Unknown Word Techniques to Learn Known Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Kostadin Cholakov ; Gertjan van Noord</p><p>Abstract: Unknown words are a hindrance to the performance of hand-crafted computational grammars of natural language. However, words with incomplete and incorrect lexical entries pose an even bigger problem because they can be the cause of a parsing failure despite being listed in the lexicon of the grammar. Such lexical entries are hard to detect and even harder to correct. We employ an error miner to pinpoint words with problematic lexical entries. An automated lexical acquisition technique is then used to learn new entries for those words which allows the grammar to parse previously uncovered sentences successfully. We test our method on a large-scale grammar of Dutch and a set of sentences for which this grammar fails to produce a parse. The application of the method enables the grammar to cover 83.76% of those sentences with an accuracy of 86.15%.</p><p>5 0.4926118 <a title="54-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Simple_Domain-Independent_Probabilistic_Approach_to_Generation.html">13 emnlp-2010-A Simple Domain-Independent Probabilistic Approach to Generation</a></p>

In our approach, we break up the end-to-end generation process into a sequence of local decisions, arranged hierarchically and each trained discriminatively. We deployed our system in three different domains—Robocup sportscasting, technical weather forecasts, and common weather forecasts, obtaining results comparable to state-ofthe-art domain-specific systems both in terms of BLEU scores and human evaluation.</p><p>6 0.48415136 <a title="54-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Practical_Linguistic_Steganography_Using_Contextual_Synonym_Substitution_and_Vertex_Colour_Coding.html">91 emnlp-2010-Practical Linguistic Steganography Using Contextual Synonym Substitution and Vertex Colour Coding</a></p>

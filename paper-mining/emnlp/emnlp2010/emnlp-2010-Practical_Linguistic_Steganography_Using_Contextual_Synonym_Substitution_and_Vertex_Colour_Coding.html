<p>Author: Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop multilingual supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (MLSLDA), a probabilistic generative model that allows insights gleaned from one language’s data to inform how the model captures properties of other languages. MLSLDA accomplishes this by jointly modeling two aspects of text: how multilingual concepts are clustered into thematically coherent topics and how topics associated with text connect to an observed regression variable (such as ratings on a sentiment scale). Concepts are represented in a general hierarchical framework that is flexible enough to express semantic ontologies, dictionaries, clustering constraints, and, as a special, degenerate case, conventional topic models. Both the topics and the regression are discovered via posterior inference from corpora. We show MLSLDA can build topics that are consistent across languages, discover sensible bilingual lexical correspondences, and leverage multilingual corpora to better predict sentiment. Sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008) offers the promise of automatically discerning how people feel about a product, person, organization, or issue based on what they write online, which is potentially of great value to businesses and other organizations. However, the vast majority of sentiment resources and algorithms are limited to a single language, usually English (Wilson, 2008; Baccianella and Sebastiani, 2010). Since no single language captures a majority of the content online, adopting such a limited approach in an increasingly global community risks missing important details and trends that might only be available when text in multiple languages is taken into account. 45 Philip Resnik Department of Linguistics and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD re snik@umd .edu Up to this point, multiple languages have been addressed in sentiment analysis primarily by transferring knowledge from a resource-rich language to a less rich language (Banea et al., 2008), or by ignoring differences in languages via translation into English (Denecke, 2008). These approaches are limited to a view of sentiment that takes place through an English-centric lens, and they ignore the potential to share information between languages. Ideally, learning sentiment cues holistically, across languages, would result in a richer and more globally consistent picture. In this paper, we introduce Multilingual Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (MLSLDA), a model for sentiment analysis on a multilingual corpus. MLSLDA discovers a consistent, unified picture of sentiment across multiple languages by learning “topics,” probabilistic partitions of the vocabulary that are consistent in terms of both meaning and relevance to observed sentiment. Our approach makes few assumptions about available resources, requiring neither parallel corpora nor machine translation. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 1, we describe the probabilistic tools that we use to create consistent topics bridging across languages and the MLSLDA model. In Section 2, we present the inference process. We discuss our set of semantic bridges between languages in Section 3, and our experiments in Section 4 demonstrate that this approach functions as an effective multilingual topic model, discovers sentiment-biased topics, and uses multilingual corpora to make better sentiment predictions across languages. Sections 5 and 6 discuss related research and discusses future work, respectively.

Both the topics and the assignments are probabilistic: a topic is represented as a probability distribution over words in the corpus, and each document is assigned a probability distribution over all the topics. Topic models built on the foundations of LDA are appealing for sentiment analysis because the learned topics can cluster together sentimentbearing words, and because topic distributions are a parsimonious way to represent a document.1 LDA has been used to discover latent structure in text (e.g. for discourse segmentation (Purver et al., 2006) and authorship (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004)). MLSLDA extends the approach by ensuring that this latent structure the underlying topics is consistent across languages. We discuss multilingual topic modeling in Section 1. 1, and in Section 1.2 we show how this enables supervised regression regardless of a document’s language. — — 1.1 Capturing Semantic Correlations Topic models posit a straightforward generative process that creates an observed corpus. For each docu- ment d, some distribution θd over unobserved topics is chosen. Then, for each word position in the document, a topic z is selected. Finally, the word for that position is generated by selecting from the topic indexed by z. (Recall that in LDA, a “topic” is a distribution over words). In monolingual topic models, the topic distribution is usually drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Using Dirichlet distributions makes it easy to specify sparse priors, and it also simplifies posterior inference because Dirichlet distributions are conjugate to multinomial distributions. However, drawing topics from Dirichlet distributions will not suffice if our vocabulary includes multiple languages. If we are working with English, German, and Chinese at the same time, a Dirichlet prior has no way to favor distributions z such that p(good|z), p(gut|z), and 1The latter property has also made LDA popular for information retrieval (Wei and Croft, 2006)). 46 p(h aˇo|z) all tend to be high at the same time, or low at hth ˇaeo same lti tmened. tMoo bree generally, et sheam structure oorf our model must encourage topics to be consistent across languages, and Dirichlet distributions cannot encode correlations between elements. One possible solution to this problem is to use the multivariate normal distribution, which can produce correlated multinomials (Blei and Lafferty, 2005), in place of the Dirichlet distribution. This has been done successfully in multilingual settings (Cohen and Smith, 2009). However, such models complicate inference by not being conjugate. Instead, we appeal to tree-based extensions of the Dirichlet distribution, which has been used to induce correlation in semantic ontologies (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007) and to encode clustering constraints (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). The key idea in this approach is to assume the vocabularies of all languages are organized according to some shared semantic structure that can be represented as a tree. For concreteness in this section, we will use WordNet (Miller, 1990) as the representation of this multilingual semantic bridge, since it is well known, offers convenient and intuitive terminology, and demonstrates the full flexibility of our approach. However, the model we describe generalizes to any tree-structured rep- resentation of multilingual knowledge; we discuss some alternatives in Section 3. WordNet organizes a vocabulary into a rooted, directed acyclic graph of nodes called synsets, short for “synonym sets.” A synset is a child of another synset if it satisfies a hyponomy relationship; each child “is a” more specific instantiation of its parent concept (thus, hyponomy is often called an “isa” relationship). For example, a “dog” is a “canine” is an “animal” is a “living thing,” etc. As an approximation, it is not unreasonable to assume that WordNet’s structure of meaning is language independent, i.e. the concept encoded by a synset can be realized using terms in different languages that share the same meaning. In practice, this organization has been used to create many alignments of international WordNets to the original English WordNet (Ordan and Wintner, 2007; Sagot and Fiˇ ser, 2008; Isahara et al., 2008). Using the structure of WordNet, we can now describe a generative process that produces a distribution over a multilingual vocabulary, which encourages correlations between words with similar meanings regardless of what language each word is in. For each synset h, we create a multilingual word distribution for that synset as follows: 1. Draw transition probabilities βh ∼ Dir (τh) 2. Draw stop probabilities ωh ∼ Dir∼ (κ Dhi)r 3. For each language l, draw emission probabilities for that synset φh,l ∼ Dir (πh,l) . For conciseness in the rest of the paper, we will refer to this generative process as multilingual Dirichlet hierarchy, or MULTDIRHIER(τ, κ, π) .2 Each observed token can be viewed as the end result of a sequence of visited synsets λ. At each node in the tree, the path can end at node iwith probability ωi,1, or it can continue to a child synset with probability ωi,0. If the path continues to another child synset, it visits child j with probability βi,j. If the path ends at a synset, it generates word k with probability φi,l,k.3 The probability of a word being emitted from a path with visited synsets r and final synset h in language lis therefore p(w, λ = r, h|l, β, ω, φ) = (iY,j)∈rβi,jωi,0(1 − ωh,1)φh,l,w. Note that the stop probability ωh (1) is independent of language, but the emission φh,l is dependent on the language. This is done to prevent the following scenario: while synset A is highly probable in a topic and words in language 1attached to that synset have high probability, words in language 2 have low probability. If this could happen for many synsets in a topic, an entire language would be effectively silenced, which would lead to inconsistent topics (e.g. 2Variables τh, πh,l, and κh are hyperparameters. Their mean is fixed, but their magnitude is sampled during inference (i.e. Pkτhτ,ih,k is constant, but τh,i is not). For the bushier bridges, (Pe.g. dictionary and flat), their mean is uniform. For GermaNet, we took frequencies from two balanced corpora of German and English: the British National Corpus (University of Oxford, 2006) and the Kern Corpus of the Digitales Wo¨rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache des 20. Jahrhunderts project (Geyken, 2007). We took these frequencies and propagated them through the multilingual hierarchy, following LDAWN’s (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007) formulation of information content (Resnik, 1995) as a Bayesian prior. The variance of the priors was initialized to be 1.0, but could be sampled during inference. 3Note that the language and word are taken as given, but the path through the semantic hierarchy is a latent random variable. 47 Topic 1 is about baseball in English and about travel in German). Separating path from emission helps ensure that topics are consistent across languages. Having defined topic distributions in a way that can preserve cross-language correspondences, we now use this distribution within a larger model that can discover cross-language patterns of use that predict sentiment. 1.2 The MLSLDA Model We will view sentiment analysis as a regression problem: given an input document, we want to predict a real-valued observation y that represents the sentiment of a document. Specifically, we build on supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (SLDA, (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007)), which makes predictions based on the topics expressed in a document; this can be thought of projecting the words in a document to low dimensional space of dimension equal to the number of topics. Blei et al. showed that using this latent topic structure can offer improved predictions over regressions based on words alone, and the approach fits well with our current goals, since word-level cues are unlikely to be identical across languages. In addition to text, SLDA has been successfully applied to other domains such as social networks (Chang and Blei, 2009) and image classification (Wang et al., 2009). The key innovation in this paper is to extend SLDA by creating topics that are globally consistent across languages, using the bridging approach above. We express our model in the form of a probabilistic generative latent-variable model that generates documents in multiple languages and assigns a realvalued score to each document. The score comes from a normal distribution whose sum is the dot product between a regression parameter η that encodes the influence of each topic on the observation and a variance σ2. With this model in hand, we use statistical inference to determine the distribution over latent variables that, given the model, best explains observed data. The generative model is as follows: 1. For each topic i= 1. . . K, draw a topic distribution {βi, ωi, φi} from MULTDIRHIER(τ, κ, π). 2. {Foβr each do}cuf mroemn tM Md = 1. . . M with language ld: (a) CDihro(oαse). a distribution over topics θd ∼ (b) For each word in the document n = 1. . . Nd, choose a topic assignment zd,n ∼ Mult (θd) and a path λd,n ending at word wd,n according to Equation 1using {βzd,n , ωzd,n , φzd,n }. 3. Choose a re?sponse variable from y Norm ?η> z¯, σ2?, where z¯ d ≡ N1 PnN=1 zd,n. ∼ Crucially, note that the topics are not independent of the sentiment task; the regression encourages terms with similar effects on the observation y to be in the same topic. The consistency of topics described above allows the same regression to be done for the entire corpus regardless of the language of the underlying document. 2 Inference Finding the model parameters most likely to explain the data is a problem of statistical inference. We employ stochastic EM (Diebolt and Ip, 1996), using a Gibbs sampler for the E-step to assign words to paths and topics. After randomly initializing the topics, we alternate between sampling the topic and path of a word (zd,n, λd,n) and finding the regression parameters η that maximize the likelihood. We jointly sample the topic and path conditioning on all of the other path and document assignments in the corpus, selecting a path and topic with probability p(zn = k, λn = r|z−n , λ−n, wn , η, σ, Θ) = p(yd|z, η, σ)p(λn = r|zn = k, λ−n, wn, τ, p(zn = k|z−n, α) . κ, π) (2) Each of these three terms reflects a different influence on the topics from the vocabulary structure, the document’s topics, and the response variable. In the next paragraphs, we will expand each of them to derive the full conditional topic distribution. As discussed in Section 1.1, the structure of the topic distribution encourages terms with the same meaning to be in the same topic, even across languages. During inference, we marginalize over possible multinomial distributions β, ω, and φ, using the observed transitions from ito j in topic k; Tk,i,j, stop counts in synset iin topic k, Ok,i,0; continue counts in synsets iin topic k, Ok,i,1 ; and emission counts in synset iin language lin topic k, Fk,i,l.

The conditional topic distribution for SLDA (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007) replaces this term with the standard Multinomial-Dirichlet. However, we believe this is the first published SLDA-style model using MCMC inference, as prior work has used variational inference (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007; Chang and Blei, 2009; Wang et al., 2009). Because the observed response variable depends on the topic assignments of a document, the conditional topic distribution is shifted toward topics that explain the observed response. Topics that move the predicted response yˆd toward the true yd will be favored.

<p>Author: Raghavendra Udupa ; Shaishav Kumar</p><p>Abstract: We propose two hashing-based solutions to the problem of fast and effective personal names spelling correction in People Search applications. The key idea behind our methods is to learn hash functions that map similar names to similar (and compact) binary codewords. The two methods differ in the data they use for learning the hash functions - the first method uses a set of names in a given language/script whereas the second uses a set of bilingual names. We show that both methods give excellent retrieval performance in comparison to several baselines on two lists of misspelled personal names. More over, the method that uses bilingual data for learning hash functions gives the best performance.</p><p>4 0.058592297 <a title="91-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Measuring_Distributional_Similarity_in_Context.html">77 emnlp-2010-Measuring Distributional Similarity in Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgiana Dinu ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: The computation of meaning similarity as operationalized by vector-based models has found widespread use in many tasks ranging from the acquisition of synonyms and paraphrases to word sense disambiguation and textual entailment. Vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation and thus best suited for measuring similarity out of context. In his paper we propose a probabilistic framework for measuring similarity in context. Central to our approach is the intuition that word meaning is represented as a probability distribution over a set of latent senses and is modulated by context. Experimental results on lexical substitution and word similarity show that our algorithm outperforms previously proposed models.</p><p>5 0.050793171 <a title="91-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-What%27s_with_the_Attitude%3F_Identifying_Sentences_with_Attitude_in_Online_Discussions.html">120 emnlp-2010-What's with the Attitude? Identifying Sentences with Attitude in Online Discussions</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Vahed Qazvinian ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: Mining sentiment from user generated content is a very important task in Natural Language Processing. An example of such content is threaded discussions which act as a very important tool for communication and collaboration in the Web. Threaded discussions include e-mails, e-mail lists, bulletin boards, newsgroups, and Internet forums. Most of the work on sentiment analysis has been centered around finding the sentiment toward products or topics. In this work, we present a method to identify the attitude of participants in an online discussion toward one another. This would enable us to build a signed network representation of participant interaction where every edge has a sign that indicates whether the interaction is positive or negative. This is different from most of the research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive links. The method is exper- imentally tested using a manually labeled set of discussion posts. The results show that the proposed method is capable of identifying attitudinal sentences, and their signs, with high accuracy and that it outperforms several other baselines.</p><p>6 0.049399298 <a title="91-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Identifying_Functional_Relations_in_Web_Text.html">59 emnlp-2010-Identifying Functional Relations in Web Text</a></p>

<p>Author: Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop multilingual supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (MLSLDA), a probabilistic generative model that allows insights gleaned from one language’s data to inform how the model captures properties of other languages. MLSLDA accomplishes this by jointly modeling two aspects of text: how multilingual concepts are clustered into thematically coherent topics and how topics associated with text connect to an observed regression variable (such as ratings on a sentiment scale). Concepts are represented in a general hierarchical framework that is flexible enough to express semantic ontologies, dictionaries, clustering constraints, and, as a special, degenerate case, conventional topic models. Both the topics and the regression are discovered via posterior inference from corpora. We show MLSLDA can build topics that are consistent across languages, discover sensible bilingual lexical correspondences, and leverage multilingual corpora to better predict sentiment. Sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008) offers the promise of automatically discerning how people feel about a product, person, organization, or issue based on what they write online, which is potentially of great value to businesses and other organizations. However, the vast majority of sentiment resources and algorithms are limited to a single language, usually English (Wilson, 2008; Baccianella and Sebastiani, 2010). Since no single language captures a majority of the content online, adopting such a limited approach in an increasingly global community risks missing important details and trends that might only be available when text in multiple languages is taken into account. 45 Philip Resnik Department of Linguistics and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD re snik@umd .edu Up to this point, multiple languages have been addressed in sentiment analysis primarily by transferring knowledge from a resource-rich language to a less rich language (Banea et al., 2008), or by ignoring differences in languages via translation into English (Denecke, 2008). These approaches are limited to a view of sentiment that takes place through an English-centric lens, and they ignore the potential to share information between languages. Ideally, learning sentiment cues holistically, across languages, would result in a richer and more globally consistent picture. In this paper, we introduce Multilingual Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (MLSLDA), a model for sentiment analysis on a multilingual corpus. MLSLDA discovers a consistent, unified picture of sentiment across multiple languages by learning “topics,” probabilistic partitions of the vocabulary that are consistent in terms of both meaning and relevance to observed sentiment. Our approach makes few assumptions about available resources, requiring neither parallel corpora nor machine translation. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 1, we describe the probabilistic tools that we use to create consistent topics bridging across languages and the MLSLDA model. In Section 2, we present the inference process. We discuss our set of semantic bridges between languages in Section 3, and our experiments in Section 4 demonstrate that this approach functions as an effective multilingual topic model, discovers sentiment-biased topics, and uses multilingual corpora to make better sentiment predictions across languages. Sections 5 and 6 discuss related research and discusses future work, respectively.

Both the topics and the assignments are probabilistic: a topic is represented as a probability distribution over words in the corpus, and each document is assigned a probability distribution over all the topics. Topic models built on the foundations of LDA are appealing for sentiment analysis because the learned topics can cluster together sentimentbearing words, and because topic distributions are a parsimonious way to represent a document.1 LDA has been used to discover latent structure in text (e.g. for discourse segmentation (Purver et al., 2006) and authorship (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004)). MLSLDA extends the approach by ensuring that this latent structure the underlying topics is consistent across languages. We discuss multilingual topic modeling in Section 1. 1, and in Section 1.2 we show how this enables supervised regression regardless of a document’s language. — — 1.1 Capturing Semantic Correlations Topic models posit a straightforward generative process that creates an observed corpus. For each docu- ment d, some distribution θd over unobserved topics is chosen. Then, for each word position in the document, a topic z is selected. Finally, the word for that position is generated by selecting from the topic indexed by z. (Recall that in LDA, a “topic” is a distribution over words). In monolingual topic models, the topic distribution is usually drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Using Dirichlet distributions makes it easy to specify sparse priors, and it also simplifies posterior inference because Dirichlet distributions are conjugate to multinomial distributions. However, drawing topics from Dirichlet distributions will not suffice if our vocabulary includes multiple languages. If we are working with English, German, and Chinese at the same time, a Dirichlet prior has no way to favor distributions z such that p(good|z), p(gut|z), and 1The latter property has also made LDA popular for information retrieval (Wei and Croft, 2006)). 46 p(h aˇo|z) all tend to be high at the same time, or low at hth ˇaeo same lti tmened. tMoo bree generally, et sheam structure oorf our model must encourage topics to be consistent across languages, and Dirichlet distributions cannot encode correlations between elements. One possible solution to this problem is to use the multivariate normal distribution, which can produce correlated multinomials (Blei and Lafferty, 2005), in place of the Dirichlet distribution. This has been done successfully in multilingual settings (Cohen and Smith, 2009). However, such models complicate inference by not being conjugate. Instead, we appeal to tree-based extensions of the Dirichlet distribution, which has been used to induce correlation in semantic ontologies (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007) and to encode clustering constraints (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). The key idea in this approach is to assume the vocabularies of all languages are organized according to some shared semantic structure that can be represented as a tree. For concreteness in this section, we will use WordNet (Miller, 1990) as the representation of this multilingual semantic bridge, since it is well known, offers convenient and intuitive terminology, and demonstrates the full flexibility of our approach. However, the model we describe generalizes to any tree-structured rep- resentation of multilingual knowledge; we discuss some alternatives in Section 3. WordNet organizes a vocabulary into a rooted, directed acyclic graph of nodes called synsets, short for “synonym sets.” A synset is a child of another synset if it satisfies a hyponomy relationship; each child “is a” more specific instantiation of its parent concept (thus, hyponomy is often called an “isa” relationship). For example, a “dog” is a “canine” is an “animal” is a “living thing,” etc. As an approximation, it is not unreasonable to assume that WordNet’s structure of meaning is language independent, i.e. the concept encoded by a synset can be realized using terms in different languages that share the same meaning. In practice, this organization has been used to create many alignments of international WordNets to the original English WordNet (Ordan and Wintner, 2007; Sagot and Fiˇ ser, 2008; Isahara et al., 2008). Using the structure of WordNet, we can now describe a generative process that produces a distribution over a multilingual vocabulary, which encourages correlations between words with similar meanings regardless of what language each word is in. For each synset h, we create a multilingual word distribution for that synset as follows: 1. Draw transition probabilities βh ∼ Dir (τh) 2. Draw stop probabilities ωh ∼ Dir∼ (κ Dhi)r 3. For each language l, draw emission probabilities for that synset φh,l ∼ Dir (πh,l) . For conciseness in the rest of the paper, we will refer to this generative process as multilingual Dirichlet hierarchy, or MULTDIRHIER(τ, κ, π) .2 Each observed token can be viewed as the end result of a sequence of visited synsets λ. At each node in the tree, the path can end at node iwith probability ωi,1, or it can continue to a child synset with probability ωi,0. If the path continues to another child synset, it visits child j with probability βi,j. If the path ends at a synset, it generates word k with probability φi,l,k.3 The probability of a word being emitted from a path with visited synsets r and final synset h in language lis therefore p(w, λ = r, h|l, β, ω, φ) = (iY,j)∈rβi,jωi,0(1 − ωh,1)φh,l,w. Note that the stop probability ωh (1) is independent of language, but the emission φh,l is dependent on the language. This is done to prevent the following scenario: while synset A is highly probable in a topic and words in language 1attached to that synset have high probability, words in language 2 have low probability. If this could happen for many synsets in a topic, an entire language would be effectively silenced, which would lead to inconsistent topics (e.g. 2Variables τh, πh,l, and κh are hyperparameters. Their mean is fixed, but their magnitude is sampled during inference (i.e. Pkτhτ,ih,k is constant, but τh,i is not). For the bushier bridges, (Pe.g. dictionary and flat), their mean is uniform. For GermaNet, we took frequencies from two balanced corpora of German and English: the British National Corpus (University of Oxford, 2006) and the Kern Corpus of the Digitales Wo¨rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache des 20. Jahrhunderts project (Geyken, 2007). We took these frequencies and propagated them through the multilingual hierarchy, following LDAWN’s (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007) formulation of information content (Resnik, 1995) as a Bayesian prior. The variance of the priors was initialized to be 1.0, but could be sampled during inference. 3Note that the language and word are taken as given, but the path through the semantic hierarchy is a latent random variable. 47 Topic 1 is about baseball in English and about travel in German). Separating path from emission helps ensure that topics are consistent across languages. Having defined topic distributions in a way that can preserve cross-language correspondences, we now use this distribution within a larger model that can discover cross-language patterns of use that predict sentiment. 1.2 The MLSLDA Model We will view sentiment analysis as a regression problem: given an input document, we want to predict a real-valued observation y that represents the sentiment of a document. Specifically, we build on supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (SLDA, (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007)), which makes predictions based on the topics expressed in a document; this can be thought of projecting the words in a document to low dimensional space of dimension equal to the number of topics. Blei et al. showed that using this latent topic structure can offer improved predictions over regressions based on words alone, and the approach fits well with our current goals, since word-level cues are unlikely to be identical across languages. In addition to text, SLDA has been successfully applied to other domains such as social networks (Chang and Blei, 2009) and image classification (Wang et al., 2009). The key innovation in this paper is to extend SLDA by creating topics that are globally consistent across languages, using the bridging approach above. We express our model in the form of a probabilistic generative latent-variable model that generates documents in multiple languages and assigns a realvalued score to each document. The score comes from a normal distribution whose sum is the dot product between a regression parameter η that encodes the influence of each topic on the observation and a variance σ2. With this model in hand, we use statistical inference to determine the distribution over latent variables that, given the model, best explains observed data. The generative model is as follows: 1. For each topic i= 1. . . K, draw a topic distribution {βi, ωi, φi} from MULTDIRHIER(τ, κ, π). 2. {Foβr each do}cuf mroemn tM Md = 1. . . M with language ld: (a) CDihro(oαse). a distribution over topics θd ∼ (b) For each word in the document n = 1. . . Nd, choose a topic assignment zd,n ∼ Mult (θd) and a path λd,n ending at word wd,n according to Equation 1using {βzd,n , ωzd,n , φzd,n }. 3. Choose a re?sponse variable from y Norm ?η> z¯, σ2?, where z¯ d ≡ N1 PnN=1 zd,n. ∼ Crucially, note that the topics are not independent of the sentiment task; the regression encourages terms with similar effects on the observation y to be in the same topic. The consistency of topics described above allows the same regression to be done for the entire corpus regardless of the language of the underlying document. 2 Inference Finding the model parameters most likely to explain the data is a problem of statistical inference. We employ stochastic EM (Diebolt and Ip, 1996), using a Gibbs sampler for the E-step to assign words to paths and topics. After randomly initializing the topics, we alternate between sampling the topic and path of a word (zd,n, λd,n) and finding the regression parameters η that maximize the likelihood. We jointly sample the topic and path conditioning on all of the other path and document assignments in the corpus, selecting a path and topic with probability p(zn = k, λn = r|z−n , λ−n, wn , η, σ, Θ) = p(yd|z, η, σ)p(λn = r|zn = k, λ−n, wn, τ, p(zn = k|z−n, α) . κ, π) (2) Each of these three terms reflects a different influence on the topics from the vocabulary structure, the document’s topics, and the response variable. In the next paragraphs, we will expand each of them to derive the full conditional topic distribution. As discussed in Section 1.1, the structure of the topic distribution encourages terms with the same meaning to be in the same topic, even across languages. During inference, we marginalize over possible multinomial distributions β, ω, and φ, using the observed transitions from ito j in topic k; Tk,i,j, stop counts in synset iin topic k, Ok,i,0; continue counts in synsets iin topic k, Ok,i,1 ; and emission counts in synset iin language lin topic k, Fk,i,l.

The conditional topic distribution for SLDA (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007) replaces this term with the standard Multinomial-Dirichlet. However, we believe this is the first published SLDA-style model using MCMC inference, as prior work has used variational inference (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007; Chang and Blei, 2009; Wang et al., 2009). Because the observed response variable depends on the topic assignments of a document, the conditional topic distribution is shifted toward topics that explain the observed response. Topics that move the predicted response yˆd toward the true yd will be favored.

<p>Author: Thomas Lin ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Determining whether a textual phrase denotes a functional relation (i.e., a relation that maps each domain element to a unique range element) is useful for numerous NLP tasks such as synonym resolution and contradiction detection. Previous work on this problem has relied on either counting methods or lexico-syntactic patterns. However, determining whether a relation is functional, by analyzing mentions of the relation in a corpus, is challenging due to ambiguity, synonymy, anaphora, and other linguistic phenomena. We present the LEIBNIZ system that overcomes these challenges by exploiting the synergy between the Web corpus and freelyavailable knowledge resources such as Freebase. It first computes multiple typedfunctionality scores, representing functionality of the relation phrase when its arguments are constrained to specific types. It then aggregates these scores to predict the global functionality for the phrase. LEIBNIZ outperforms previous work, increasing area under the precisionrecall curve from 0.61 to 0.88. We utilize LEIBNIZ to generate the first public repository of automatically-identified functional relations.</p><p>4 0.2580362 <a title="91-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Hashing-Based_Approaches_to_Spelling_Correction_of_Personal_Names.html">56 emnlp-2010-Hashing-Based Approaches to Spelling Correction of Personal Names</a></p>

The key idea behind our methods is to learn hash functions that map similar names to similar (and compact) binary codewords. The two methods differ in the data they use for learning the hash functions - the first method uses a set of names in a given language/script whereas the second uses a set of bilingual names. We show that both methods give excellent retrieval performance in comparison to several baselines on two lists of misspelled personal names. More over, the method that uses bilingual data for learning hash functions gives the best performance.</p><p>5 0.18270312 <a title="91-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Measuring_Distributional_Similarity_in_Context.html">77 emnlp-2010-Measuring Distributional Similarity in Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgiana Dinu ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: The computation of meaning similarity as operationalized by vector-based models has found widespread use in many tasks ranging from the acquisition of synonyms and paraphrases to word sense disambiguation and textual entailment. Vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation and thus best suited for measuring similarity out of context. In his paper we propose a probabilistic framework for measuring similarity in context. Central to our approach is the intuition that word meaning is represented as a probability distribution over a set of latent senses and is modulated by context. Experimental results on lexical substitution and word similarity show that our algorithm outperforms previously proposed models.</p><p>6 0.16939384 <a title="91-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Word_Sense_Induction__Disambiguation_Using_Hierarchical_Random_Graphs.html">124 emnlp-2010-Word Sense Induction  Disambiguation Using Hierarchical Random Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Vahed Qazvinian ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: Mining sentiment from user generated content is a very important task in Natural Language Processing. An example of such content is threaded discussions which act as a very important tool for communication and collaboration in the Web. Threaded discussions include e-mails, e-mail lists, bulletin boards, newsgroups, and Internet forums. Most of the work on sentiment analysis has been centered around finding the sentiment toward products or topics. In this work, we present a method to identify the attitude of participants in an online discussion toward one another. This would enable us to build a signed network representation of participant interaction where every edge has a sign that indicates whether the interaction is positive or negative. This is different from most of the research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive links. The method is exper- imentally tested using a manually labeled set of discussion posts. The results show that the proposed method is capable of identifying attitudinal sentences, and their signs, with high accuracy and that it outperforms several other baselines.</p><p>4 0.25390384 <a title="91-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Minimum_Error_Rate_Training_by_Sampling_the_Translation_Lattice.html">78 emnlp-2010-Minimum Error Rate Training by Sampling the Translation Lattice</a></p>
<p>Author: Samidh Chatterjee ; Nicola Cancedda</p><p>Abstract: Minimum Error Rate Training is the algorithm for log-linear model parameter training most used in state-of-the-art Statistical Machine Translation systems. In its original formulation, the algorithm uses N-best lists output by the decoder to grow the Translation Pool that shapes the surface on which the actual optimization is performed. Recent work has been done to extend the algorithm to use the entire translation lattice built by the decoder, instead of N-best lists. We propose here a third, intermediate way, consisting in growing the translation pool using samples randomly drawn from the translation lattice. We empirically measure a systematic im- provement in the BLEU scores compared to training using N-best lists, without suffering the increase in computational complexity associated with operating with the whole lattice.</p><p>5 0.25301409 <a title="91-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-PEM%3A_A_Paraphrase_Evaluation_Metric_Exploiting_Parallel_Texts.html">89 emnlp-2010-PEM: A Paraphrase Evaluation Metric Exploiting Parallel Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Chang Liu ; Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present PEM, the first fully automatic metric to evaluate the quality of paraphrases, and consequently, that of paraphrase generation systems. Our metric is based on three criteria: adequacy, fluency, and lexical dissimilarity. The key component in our metric is a robust and shallow semantic similarity measure based on pivot language N-grams that allows us to approximate adequacy independently of lexical similarity. Human evaluation shows that PEM achieves high correlation with human judgments.</p><p>6 0.25211301 <a title="91-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Assessing_Phrase-Based_Translation_Models_with_Oracle_Decoding.html">18 emnlp-2010-Assessing Phrase-Based Translation Models with Oracle Decoding</a></p>

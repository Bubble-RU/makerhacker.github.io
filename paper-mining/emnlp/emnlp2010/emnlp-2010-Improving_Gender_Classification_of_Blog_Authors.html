<p>Author: Lei Shi ; Rada Mihalcea ; Mingjun Tian</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a method that automatically builds text classifiers in a new language by training on already labeled data in another language. Our method transfers the classification knowledge across languages by translating the model features and by using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm that naturally takes into account the ambiguity associated with the translation of a word. We further exploit the readily available unlabeled data in the target language via semisupervised learning, and adapt the translated model to better fit the data distribution of the target language.</p><p>4 0.078513086 <a title="61-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Joint_Training_and_Decoding_Using_Virtual_Nodes_for_Cascaded_Segmentation_and_Tagging_Tasks.html">69 emnlp-2010-Joint Training and Decoding Using Virtual Nodes for Cascaded Segmentation and Tagging Tasks</a></p>
<p>Author: Xian Qian ; Qi Zhang ; Yaqian Zhou ; Xuanjing Huang ; Lide Wu</p><p>Abstract: Many sequence labeling tasks in NLP require solving a cascade of segmentation and tagging subtasks, such as Chinese POS tagging, named entity recognition, and so on. Traditional pipeline approaches usually suffer from error propagation. Joint training/decoding in the cross-product state space could cause too many parameters and high inference complexity. In this paper, we present a novel method which integrates graph structures of two subtasks into one using virtual nodes, and performs joint training and decoding in the factorized state space. Experimental evaluations on CoNLL 2000 shallow parsing data set and Fourth SIGHAN Bakeoff CTB POS tagging data set demonstrate the superiority of our method over cross-product, pipeline and candidate reranking approaches.</p><p>5 0.072260611 <a title="61-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Simple_Type-Level_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging.html">97 emnlp-2010-Simple Type-Level Unsupervised POS Tagging</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoong Keok Lee ; Aria Haghighi ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tag distributions are known to exhibit sparsity a word is likely to take a single predominant tag in a corpus. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating this sparsity constraint improves tagging accuracy. However, in existing systems, this expansion come with a steep increase in model complexity. This paper proposes a simple and effective tagging method that directly models tag sparsity and other distributional properties of valid POS tag assignments. In addition, this formulation results in a dramatic reduction in the number of model parameters thereby, enabling unusually rapid training. Our experiments consistently demonstrate that this model architecture yields substantial performance gains over more complex tagging — counterparts. On several languages, we report performance exceeding that of more complex state-of-the art systems.1</p><p>6 0.06935554 <a title="61-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Negative_Training_Data_Can_be_Harmful_to_Text_Classification.html">85 emnlp-2010-Negative Training Data Can be Harmful to Text Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Amr Ahmed ; Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: With the proliferation of user-generated articles over the web, it becomes imperative to develop automated methods that are aware of the ideological-bias implicit in a document collection. While there exist methods that can classify the ideological bias of a given document, little has been done toward understanding the nature of this bias on a topical-level. In this paper we address the problem ofmodeling ideological perspective on a topical level using a factored topic model. We develop efficient inference algorithms using Collapsed Gibbs sampling for posterior inference, and give various evaluations and illustrations of the utility of our model on various document collections with promising results. Finally we give a Metropolis-Hasting inference algorithm for a semi-supervised extension with decent results.</p><p>3 0.33008641 <a title="61-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Negative_Training_Data_Can_be_Harmful_to_Text_Classification.html">85 emnlp-2010-Negative Training Data Can be Harmful to Text Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao-Li Li ; Bing Liu ; See-Kiong Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the effects of training data on binary text classification and postulates that negative training data is not needed and may even be harmful for the task. Traditional binary classification involves building a classifier using labeled positive and negative training examples. The classifier is then applied to classify test instances into positive and negative classes. A fundamental assumption is that the training and test data are identically distributed. However, this assumption may not hold in practice. In this paper, we study a particular problem where the positive data is identically distributed but the negative data may or may not be so. Many practical text classification and retrieval applications fit this model. We argue that in this setting negative training data should not be used, and that PU learning can be employed to solve the problem. Empirical evaluation has been con- ducted to support our claim. This result is important as it may fundamentally change the current binary classification paradigm.</p><p>4 0.32614729 <a title="61-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Context_Comparison_of_Bursty_Events_in_Web_Search_and_Online_Media.html">32 emnlp-2010-Context Comparison of Bursty Events in Web Search and Online Media</a></p>

<p>Author: Yue Zhang ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: We show that the standard beam-search algorithm can be used as an efficient decoder for the global linear model of Zhang and Clark (2008) for joint word segmentation and POS-tagging, achieving a significant speed improvement. Such decoding is enabled by: (1) separating full word features from partial word features so that feature templates can be instantiated incrementally, according to whether the current character is separated or appended; (2) deciding the POS-tag of a potential word when its first character is processed. Early-update is used with perceptron training so that the linear model gives a high score to a correct partial candidate as well as a full output. Effective scoring of partial structures allows the decoder to give high accuracy with a small beam-size of 16. In our 10-fold crossvalidation experiments with the Chinese Tree- . bank, our system performed over 10 times as fast as Zhang and Clark (2008) with little accuracy loss. The accuracy of our system on the standard CTB 5 test was competitive with the best in the literature. 1 Introduction and Motivation Several approaches have been proposed to solve word segmentation and POS-tagging jointly, including the reranking approach (Shi and Wang, 2007; Jiang et al., 2008b), the hybrid approach (Nakagawa and Uchimoto, 2007; Jiang et al., 2008a), and the single-model approach (Ng and Low, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Kruengkrai et al., 2009). These methods led to accuracy improvements over the traditional, pipelined segmentation and POS-tagging . . . 843 clark} @ cl cam ac uk baseline by avoiding segmentation error propagation and making use of part-of-speech information to improve segmentation. The single-model approach to joint segmentation and POS-tagging offers consistent training of all in- formation, concerning words, characters and partsof-speech. However, exact inference with dynamic programming can be infeasible if features are defined over a large enough range of the output, such as over a two-word history. In our previous work (Zhang and Clark, 2008), which we refer to as Z&C08; from now on, we used an approximate decoding algorithm that keeps track of a set of partially built structures for each character, which can be seen as a dynamic programming chart which is greatly reduced by pruning. In this paper we follow the line of single-model research, in particular the global linear model of Z&C08.; We show that effective decoding can be achieved with standard beam-search, which gives significant speed improvements compared to the decoding algorithm of Z&C08;, and achieves accuracies that are competitive with the state-of-the-art. Our research is also in line with recent research on improving the speed of NLP systems with little or no accuracy loss (Charniak et al., 2006; Roark and Hollingshead, 2008). Our speed improvement is achieved by the use of a single-beam decoder. Given an input sentence, candidate outputs are built incrementally, one character at a time. When each character is processed, it is combined with existing candidates in all possible ways to generate new candidates, and an agenda is used to keep the N-best candidate outputs from ProceMedITin,g Ms oasfs thaceh 2u0se1t0ts C,o UnSfAer,e n9c-e1 on O Ectmobpeir ic 2a0l1 M0.e ?tc ho2d0s10 in A Nsastoucira tlio Lnan fogru Cagoem Ppruotcaetisosninagl, L pinag eusis 8t4ic3s–852, the begining of the sentence to the current character. Compared to the multiple-beam search algorithm of Z&C08;, the use of a single beam can lead to an order of magnitude faster decoding speed. 1.1 The processing of partial words An important problem that we solve in this paper is the handling of partial words with a single beam decoder for the global model. As we pointed out in Z&C08;, it is very difficult to score partial words properly when they are compared with full words, although such comparison is necessary for incremental decoding with a single-beam. To allow comparisons with full words, partial words can either be treated as full words, or handled differently. We showed in Z&C08; that a naive single-beam decoder which treats partial words in the same way as full words failed to give a competitive accu- racy. An important reason for the low accuracy is over-segmentation during beam-search. Consider the three characters “ 自 来 水 (tap water)”. The first two characters do not make sense when put together as a single word. Rather, when treated as two singlecharacter words, they can make sense in a sentence such as “请 (please) 自 (self) 来 (come) 取 (take)”. Therefore, when using single-beam search to process “ 自 来 水 (tap water)”, the two-character word candidate “ 自 来” is likely to have been thrown off the agenda before the third character “水” is considered, leading to an unrecoverable segmentation error. This problem is even more severe for a joint segmentor and POS-tagger than for a pure word segmentor, since the POS-tags and POS-tag bigram of “ 自 and “来” further supports them being separated when ”来” is considered. The multiple-beam search decoder we proposed in Z&C08; can be seen as a means to ensure that the three characters “ 自 来 水” always have a chance to be considered as a single word. It explores candidate segmentations from the beginning of the sentence until each character, and avoids the problem of processing partial words by considering only full words. However, since it ex- ” plores a larger part of the search space than a singlebeam decoder, its time complexity is correspondingly higher. In this paper, we treat partial words differently from full words, so that in the previous example, 844 the decoder can take the first two characters in “ 自 来 水 (tap water)” as a partial word, and keep it in the beam before the third character is processed. One challenge is the representation of POS-tags for partial words. The POS of a partial word is undefined without the corresponding full word information. Though a partial word can make sense with a particular POS-tag when it is treated as a complete word, this POS-tag is not necessarily the POS of the full word which contains the partial word. Take the three-character sequence “下 雨 天” as an example. The first character “下” represents a singlecharacter word “below”, for which the POS can be LC or VV. The first two characters “下 雨” represent a two-character word “rain”, for which the POS can be VV. Moreover, all three characters when put together make the word “rainy day”, for which the POS is NN. As discussed above, assigning POS tags to partial words as if they were full words leads to low accuracy. An obvious solution to the above problem is not to assign a POS to a partial word until it becomes a full word. However, lack of POS information for partial words makes them less competitive compared to full words in the beam, since the scores of full words are futher supported by POS and POS ngram information. Therefore, not assigning POS to partial words potentially leads to over segmentation. In our experiments, this method did not give comparable accuracies to our Z&C08; system. In this paper, we take a different approach, and assign a POS-tag to a partial word when its first character is separated from the final character of the previous word. When more characters are appended to a partial word, the POS is not changed. The idea is to use the POS of a partial word as the predicted POS of the full word it will become. Possible predictions are made with the first character of the word, and the likely ones will be kept in the beam for the next processing steps. For example, with the three characters “下 雨 天”, we try to keep two partial words (besides full words) in the beam when the first word “下” is processed, with the POS being VV and NN, respectively. The first POS predicts the two-character word “下 雨” ， and the second the three-character word “下 雨 天”. Now when the second character is processed, we still need to maintain the possible POS NN in the agenda, which predicts the three-character word “下 雨 天”. As a main contribution of this paper, we show that the mechanism ofpredicting the POS at the first character gives competitive accuracy. This mechanism can be justified theoretically. Unlike alphabetical languages, each Chinese character represents some specific meanings. Given a character, it is natural for a human speaker to know immediately what types of words it can start. The allows the knowledge of possible POS-tags of words that a character can start, using information about the character from the training data. Moreover, the POS of the previous words to the current word are also useful in deciding possible POS for the word.1 The mechanism of first-character decision of POS also boosts the efficiency, since the enumeration of POS is unecessary when a character is appended to the end of an existing word. As a result, the complexity of each processing step is reduce by half compared to a method without POS prediction. Finally, an intuitive way to represent the status of a partial word is using a flag explicitly, which means an early decision of the segmentation of the next incoming character. We take a simpler alternative approach, and treat every word as a partial word until the next incoming character is separated from the last character of this word. Before a word is confirmed as a full word, we only apply to it features that represent its current partial status, such as character bigrams, its starting character and its part-ofspeech, etc. Full word features, including the first and last characters of a word, are applied immediately after a word is confirmed as complete. An important component for our proposed system is the training process, which needs to ensure that the model scores a partial word with predicted POS properly. We use the averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002) for training, together with the “early update” mechanism of Collins and Roark (2004). Rather than updating the parameters after decoding is com- plete, the modified algorithm updates parameters at any processing step if the correct partial candidate falls out of the beam. In our experiments using the Chinese Treebank 1The next incoming characters are also a useful source of information for predicting the POS. However, our system achieved competitive accuracy with Z&C08; without such character lookahead features. 845 data, our system ran an order of magnitude faster than our Z&C08; system with little loss of accuracy. The accuracy of our system was competitive with other recent models. 2 Model and Feature Templates We use a linear model to score both partial and full candidate outputs. Given an input x, the score of a candidate output y is computed as: Score(y) = Φ(y) · where Φ(y) is the global feature vector extracted from y, and is the parameter vector of the model. Figure 1 shows the feature templates for the model, where templates 1 14 contain only segmentation information and templates 15 29 contain w~ , w~ – – both segmentation and POS information. Each template is instantiated according to the current character in the decoding process. Row “For” shows the conditions for template instantiation, where “s” indicates that the corresponding template is instantiated when the current character starts a new word, and “a” indicates that the corresponding template is instantiated when the current character does not start a new word. In the row for feature templates, w, t and c are used to represent a word, a POS-tag and a character, respectively. The subscripts are based on the current character, where w−1 represents the first word to the left of the current character, and p−2 represents the POS-tag on the second word to the left of the current character, and so on. As an example, feature template 1is instantiated when the current character starts a new word, and the resulting feature value is the word to the left of this character. start(w), end(w) and len(w) represent the first character, the last character and the length of word w, respectively. The length of a word is normalized to 16 if it is larger than 16. cat(c) represents the POS category of character c, which is the set of POS-tags seen on character c, as we used in Z&C08.; Given a partial or complete candidate y, its global feature vector Φ(y) is computed by instantiating all applicable feature templates from Table 1 for each character in y, according to whether or not the character is separated from the previous character. The feature templates are mostly taken from, or inspired by, the feature templates of Z&C08.; Templates 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, Feature templateFor 24, 27 and 29 concern complete word information, and they are used in the model to differentiate correct and incorrect output structures in the same way as our Z&C08; model. Templates 6, 7, 9, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26 and 28 concern partial word information, whose role in the model is to indicate the likelihood that the partial word including the current character will become a correct full word. They act as guidance for the action to take for the cur846 function DECODE(sent, agenda): CLEAR(agenda) ADDITEM(agenda, “”) for index in [0..LEN(sent)]: for cand in agenda: new ← APPEND(cand, sent[index]) ADDITEM(agenda, new) for pos in TAGSET(): new ← SEP(cand, sent[index], pos) ADDITEM(agenda, new) agenda ← N-BEST(agenda) retaugrenn BEST(agenda) Figure 1: The incremental beam-search decoder. rent character according to the context, and are the crucial reason for the effectiveness of the algorithm with a small beam-size. 2.1 Decoding The decoding algorithm builds an output candidate incrementally, one character at a time. Each character can either be attached to the current word or separated as the start a new word. When the current character starts a new word, a POS-tag is assigned to the new word. An agenda is used by the decoder to keep the N-best candidates during the incremental process. Before decoding starts, the agenda is initialized with an empty sentence. When a character is processed, existing candidates are removed from the agenda and extended with the current character in all possible ways, and the N-best newly generated candidates are put back onto the agenda. After all input characters have been processed, the highest-scored candidate from the agenda is taken as the output. Pseudo code for the decoder is shown in Figure 1. CLEAR removes all items from the agenda, ADDITEM adds a new item onto the agenda, N-BEST returns the N highest-scored items from the agenda, and BEST returns the highest-scored item from the agenda. LEN returns the number of characters in a sentence, and sent[i] returns the ith character from the sentence. APPEND appends a character to the last word in a candidate, and SEP joins a character as the start of a new word in a candidate, assigning a POS-tag to the new word. Both our decoding algorithm and the decoding algorithm of Z&C08; run in linear time. However, in order to generate possible candidates for each character, Z&C08; uses an extra loop to search for possible words that end with the current character. A restriction to the maximum word length is applied to limit the number of iterations in this loop, without which the algorithm would have quadratic time complexity. In contrast, our decoder does not search backword for the possible starting character of any word. Segmentation ambiguities are resolved by binary choices between the actions append or separate for each character, and no POS enumeration is required when the character is appended. This improves the speed by a significant factor. 2.2 Training The learning algorithm is based on the generalized perceptron (Collins, 2002), but parameter adjustments can be performed at any character during the decoding process, using the “early update” mechanism of Collins and Roark (2004). The parameter vector of the model is initialized as all zeros before training, and used to decode training examples. Each training example is turned into the raw input format, and processed in the same way as decoding. After each character is processed, partial candidates in the agenda are compared to the corresponding gold-standard output for the same characters. If none of the candidates in the agenda are correct, the decoding is stopped and the parameter vector is updated by adding the global feature vector of the gold-standard partial output and subtracting the global feature vector of the highest-scored partial candidate in the agenda. The training process then moves on to the next example. However, if any item in the agenda is the same as the corresponding gold-standard, the decoding process moves to the next character, without any change to the parameter values. After all characters are processed, the decoder prediction is compared with the training example. If the prediction is correct, the parameter vector is not changed; otherwise it is updated by adding the global feature vector of the training example and subtracting the global feature vector of the decoder prediction, just as the perceptron algorithm does. The same training examples can be used to train the model for multiple iterations. We use 847 the averaged parameter vector (Collins, 2002) as the final model. Pseudocode for the training algorithm is shown in Figure 2. It is based on the decoding algorithm in Figure 1, and the main differences are: (1) the training algorithm takes the gold-standard output and the parameter vector as two additional arguments; (2) the training algorithm does not return a prediction, but modifies the parameter vector when necessary; (3) lines 11to 20 are additional lines of code for parameter updates. Without lines 11 to 16, the training algorithm is exactly the same as the generalized perceptron algorithm. These lines are added to ensure that the agenda contains highly probable candidates during the whole beam-search process, and they are crucial to the high accuracy of the system. As stated earlier, the decoder relies on proper scoring of partial words to maintain a set of high quality candidates in the agenda. Updating the value of the parameter vector for partial outputs can be seen as a means to ensure correct scoring of partial candidates at any character. 2.3 Pruning We follow Z&C08; and use several pruning methods, most of which serve to to improve the accuracy by removing irrelevant candidates from the beam. First, the system records the maximum number of characters that a word with a particular POS-tag can have. For example, from the Chinese Treebank that we used for our experiments, most POS are associated with only with one- or two-character words. The only POS-tags that are seen with words over ten characters long are NN (noun), NR (proper noun) and CD (numbers). The maximum word length information is initialized as all ones, and updated according to each training example before it is processed. Second, a tag dictionary is used to record POStags associated with each word. During decoding, frequent words and words with “closed set” tags2 are only allowed POS-tags according to the tag dictionary, while other words are allowed every POS-tag to make candidate outputs. Whether a word is a frequent word is decided by the number of times it has been seen in the training process. Denoting the num2“Closed set” tags are the set of POS-tags which are only associated with a fixed set of words, according to the Penn Chinese Treebank specifications (Xia, 2000). function TRAIN(sent, agenda, gold-standard, w~ ): 01: CLEAR(agenda) 02: ADDITEM(agenda, “”) 03: for index in [0..LEN(sent)]: 04: 05: 06: 07: 08: 09: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: 17: 18: 19: 20: 21: for cand in agenda: new ← APPEND(cand, sent[index]) ADDITEM(agenda, new) for pos in TAGSET(): new ← SEP(cand, sent[index], pos) ADDITEM(agenda, new) agenda ← N-BEST(agenda) faogre cnadnad ← ←in agenda: if cand = gold-standard[0:index] : CONTINUE w~ ← w~ + Φ(gold-standard[0:index]) ww~~ ← ww~ ~ - Φ(BEST(agenda)) wr~et ←urn w~ if BEST(agenda) gold-standard: w~ ← a ~wg + Φ(gold-standard) ww~~ ← ww~ ~ - Φ(BEST(agenda)) wr~et ←urn w~ return = Figure 2: The incremental learning function. ber of times the most frequent word has been seen with M, a word is a frequent word if it has been seen more than M/5000 5 times. The threshold value is taken from Z&C08;, and we did not adjust it during development. Word frequencies are initialized as zeros and updated according to each training example before it is processed; the tag dictionary is initialized as empty and updated according to each training example before it is processed. Third, we make an additional record of the initial characters for words with “closed set” tags. During decoding, when the current character is added as the start of a new word, “closed set” tags are only assigned to the word if it is consistent with the record. This type of pruning is used in addition to the tag + dictionary to prune invalid partial words, while the tag dictionary is used to prune complete words. The record for initial character and POS is initially empty, and udpated according to each training example before it is processed. Finally, at any decoding step, we group partial 848 candidates that are generated by separating the current character as the start of a new word by the signature p0p−1w−1, and keep only the best among those having the same p0p−1w−1. The signature p0p−1w−1 is decided by the feature templates we use: it can be shown that if two candidates cand1 and cand2 generated at the same step have the same signature, and the score of cand1 is higher than the score of cand2, then at any future step, the highest scored candidate generated from cand1 will always have a higher score than the highest scored candidate generated from cand2. From the above pruning methods, only the third was not used by Z&C08.; It can be seen as an extra mechanism to help keep likely partial words in the agenda and improve the accuracy, but which does not give our system a speed advantage over Z&C08.; 3 Experiments We used the Chinese Treebank (CTB) data to perform one set of development tests and two sets of fi- Training iteration Figure 3: The influence of beam-sizes, and the convergence of the perceptron. nal tests. The CTB 4 was split into two parts, with the CTB 3 being used for a 10-fold cross validation test to compare speed and accuracies with Z&C08;, and the rest being used for development. The CTB 5 was used to perform the additional set of experiments to compare accuracies with other recent work. We use the standard F-measure to evaluate output accuracies. For word segmentation, precision is defined as the number of correctly segmented words divided by the total number of words in the output, and recall is defined as the number of correctly segmented words divided by the total number of words in the gold-standard output. For joint segmentation and POS-tagging, precision is defined as the number of correctly segmented and POS-tagged words divided by the total number of words from the output, and recall is defined as the correctly segmented and POS-tagged words divided by the total number of words in the gold-standard output. All our experiments were performed on a Linux platform, and a single 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 CPU. 3.1 Development tests Our development data consists of 150K words in 4798 sentences. 80% of the data were randomly chosen as the development training data, while the rest were used as the development test data. Our development tests were mainly used to decide the size ofthe beam, the number oftraining iterations, the ef- fect of partial features in beam-search decoding, and the effect of incremental learning (i.e. early update). 849 Figure 3 shows the accuracy curves for joint segmentation and POS-tagging by the number of training iterations, using different beam sizes. With the size of the beam increasing from 1to 32, the accuracies generally increase, while the amount of increase becomes small when the size of the beam becomes 16. After the 10th iteration, a beam size of 32 does not always give better accuracies than a beam size of 16. We therefore chose 16 as the size of the beam for our system. The testing times for each beam size between 1 and 32 are 7.16s, 11.90s, 18.42s, 27.82s, 46.77s and 89.21s, respectively. The corresponding speeds in the number of sentences per second are 111.45, 67.06, 43.32, 28.68, 17.06 and 8.95, respectively. Figure 3 also shows that the accuracy increases with an increased number of training iterations, but the amount of increase becomes small after the 25th iteration. We chose 29 as the number of iterations to train our system. The effect of incremental training: We compare the accuracies by incremental training using early update and normal perceptron training. In the normal perceptron training case, lines 11to 16 are taken out of the training algorithm in Figure 2. The algorithm reached the best performance at the 22nd iteration, with the segmentation F-score being 90.58% and joint F-score being 83.38%. In the incremental training case, the algorithm reached the best accuracy at the 30th training iteration, obtaining a segmentation F-score of 91.14% and a joint F-score of 84.06%. 3.2 Final tests using CTB 3 CTB 3 consists of 150K words in 10364 sentences. We follow Z&C08; and split it into 10 equal-sized parts. In each test, one part is taken as the test data and the other nine are combined together as the training data. We compare the speed and accuracy with the joint segmentor and tagger of Z&C08;, which is publicly available as the ZPar system, version 0.23. The results are shown in Table 2, where each row shows one cross validation test. The column head- ings “sf”, “jf”, “time” and “speed” refer to segmentation F-measure, joint F-measure, testing time (in 3http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/zpar #sZf&C08jftimespeed; tshfis papjefrtimespeed seconds) and testing speed (in the number of sentences per second), respectively. Our system gave a joint segmentation and POStagging F-score of 91.37%, which is only 0.04% lower than that of ZPar 0.2. The speed of our system was over 10 times as fast as ZPar 0.2. 3.3 Final tests using CTB 5 We follow Kruengkrai et al. (2009) and split the CTB 5 into training, development testing and testing sets, as shown in Table 3. We ignored the development test data since our system had been developed in previous experiments. Kruengkrai et al. (2009) made use of character type knowledge for spaces, numerals, symbols, alphabets, Chinese and other characters. In the previous experiments, our system did not use any knowledge beyond the training data. To make the comparison fairer, we included knowledge of English letters and Arabic numbers in this experiment. During both training and decoding, English letters and Arabic numbers are segmented using simple rules, treating consecutive English letters or Arabic numbers as a single word. The results are shown in Table 4, where row “N07” refers to the model of Nakagawa and Uchimoto (2007), rows “J08a” and “b” refer to the models of Jiang et al. (2008a) and Jiang et al. (2008b), and row “K09” refers to the models of Kruengkrai et al. (2009). Columns “sf” and “jf” refer to segmentation and joint accuracies, respectively.

At the very least, the single model approach with a simple decoder achieved competitive accuracies to what has been achieved so far by the reranking (Shi and Wang, 2007; Jiang et al., 2008b) models and an ensemble model using machine-translation techniques (Jiang et al., 2008a). This may shed new light on joint segmentation and POS-tagging methods. Kruengkrai et al. (2009) and Zhang and Clark (2008) are the most similar to our system among related work. Both systems use a discriminatively trained linear model to score candidate outputs. The work of Kruengkrai et al. (2009) is based on Nakagawa and Uchimoto (2007), which separates the processing of known words and unknown words, and uses a set of segmentation tags to represent the segmentation of characters. In contrast, our model is conceptually simpler, and does not differentiate known words and unknown words. Moreover, our model is based on our previous work, in line with Zhang and Clark (2007), which does not treat word segmentation as character sequence labeling. Our learning and decoding algorithms are also different from Kruengkrai et al. (2009). While Kruengkrai et al. (2009) perform dynamic programming and MIRA learning, we use beam-search to perform incremental decoding, and the early-update version of the perceptron algorithm to train the model. Dynamic programming is exact inference, for which the time complexity is decided by the locality of feature templates. In contrast, beam-search is approximate and can run in linear time. The parameter updating for our algorithm is conceptually and computationally simpler than MIRA, though its performance can be slightly lower. However, the earlyupdate mechanism we use is consistent with our incremental approach, and improves the learning of the beam-search process. 5 Conclusion We showed that a simple beam-search decoding algorithm can be effectively applied to the decoding problem for a global linear model for joint word segmentation and POS-tagging. By guiding search with partial word information and performing learning for partial candidates, our system achieved sig- nificantly faster speed with little accuracy loss compared to the system of Z&C08.; The source code of our joint segmentor and POStagger can be found at: www.sourceforge.net/projects/zpar, version 0.4. 851 Acknowledgements We thank Canasai Kruengkrai for discussion on efficiency issues, and the anonymous reviewers for their suggestions.

<p>Author: Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu</p><p>Abstract: The problem of automatically classifying the gender of a blog author has important applications in many commercial domains. Existing systems mainly use features such as words, word classes, and POS (part-ofspeech) n-grams, for classification learning. In this paper, we propose two new techniques to improve the current result. The first technique introduces a new class of features which are variable length POS sequence patterns mined from the training data using a sequence pattern mining algorithm. The second technique is a new feature selection method which is based on an ensemble of several feature selection criteria and approaches. Empirical evaluation using a real-life blog data set shows that these two techniques improve the classification accuracy of the current state-ofthe-art methods significantly.</p><p>2 0.39023948 <a title="61-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2010-Unsupervised_Parse_Selection_for_HPSG.html">114 emnlp-2010-Unsupervised Parse Selection for HPSG</a></p>
<p>Author: Rebecca Dridan ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: Parser disambiguation with precision grammars generally takes place via statistical ranking of the parse yield of the grammar using a supervised parse selection model. In the standard process, the parse selection model is trained over a hand-disambiguated treebank, meaning that without a significant investment of effort to produce the treebank, parse selection is not possible. Furthermore, as treebanking is generally streamlined with parse selection models, creating the initial treebank without a model requires more resources than subsequent treebanks. In this work, we show that, by taking advantage of the constrained nature of these HPSG grammars, we can learn a discriminative parse selection model from raw text in a purely unsupervised fashion. This allows us to bootstrap the treebanking process and provide better parsers faster, and with less resources.</p><p>3 0.25989735 <a title="61-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Automatic_Analysis_of_Rhythmic_Poetry_with_Applications_to_Generation_and_Translation.html">19 emnlp-2010-Automatic Analysis of Rhythmic Poetry with Applications to Generation and Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jordan Boyd-Graber ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop multilingual supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (MLSLDA), a probabilistic generative model that allows insights gleaned from one language’s data to inform how the model captures properties of other languages. MLSLDA accomplishes this by jointly modeling two aspects of text: how multilingual concepts are clustered into thematically coherent topics and how topics associated with text connect to an observed regression variable (such as ratings on a sentiment scale). Concepts are represented in a general hierarchical framework that is flexible enough to express semantic ontologies, dictionaries, clustering constraints, and, as a special, degenerate case, conventional topic models. Both the topics and the regression are discovered via posterior inference from corpora. We show MLSLDA can build topics that are consistent across languages, discover sensible bilingual lexical correspondences, and leverage multilingual corpora to better predict sentiment. Sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008) offers the promise of automatically discerning how people feel about a product, person, organization, or issue based on what they write online, which is potentially of great value to businesses and other organizations. However, the vast majority of sentiment resources and algorithms are limited to a single language, usually English (Wilson, 2008; Baccianella and Sebastiani, 2010). Since no single language captures a majority of the content online, adopting such a limited approach in an increasingly global community risks missing important details and trends that might only be available when text in multiple languages is taken into account. 45 Philip Resnik Department of Linguistics and UMIACS University of Maryland College Park, MD re snik@umd .edu Up to this point, multiple languages have been addressed in sentiment analysis primarily by transferring knowledge from a resource-rich language to a less rich language (Banea et al., 2008), or by ignoring differences in languages via translation into English (Denecke, 2008). These approaches are limited to a view of sentiment that takes place through an English-centric lens, and they ignore the potential to share information between languages. Ideally, learning sentiment cues holistically, across languages, would result in a richer and more globally consistent picture. In this paper, we introduce Multilingual Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (MLSLDA), a model for sentiment analysis on a multilingual corpus. MLSLDA discovers a consistent, unified picture of sentiment across multiple languages by learning “topics,” probabilistic partitions of the vocabulary that are consistent in terms of both meaning and relevance to observed sentiment. Our approach makes few assumptions about available resources, requiring neither parallel corpora nor machine translation. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 1, we describe the probabilistic tools that we use to create consistent topics bridging across languages and the MLSLDA model. In Section 2, we present the inference process. We discuss our set of semantic bridges between languages in Section 3, and our experiments in Section 4 demonstrate that this approach functions as an effective multilingual topic model, discovers sentiment-biased topics, and uses multilingual corpora to make better sentiment predictions across languages. Sections 5 and 6 discuss related research and discusses future work, respectively.

Both the topics and the assignments are probabilistic: a topic is represented as a probability distribution over words in the corpus, and each document is assigned a probability distribution over all the topics. Topic models built on the foundations of LDA are appealing for sentiment analysis because the learned topics can cluster together sentimentbearing words, and because topic distributions are a parsimonious way to represent a document.1 LDA has been used to discover latent structure in text (e.g. for discourse segmentation (Purver et al., 2006) and authorship (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004)). MLSLDA extends the approach by ensuring that this latent structure the underlying topics is consistent across languages. We discuss multilingual topic modeling in Section 1. 1, and in Section 1.2 we show how this enables supervised regression regardless of a document’s language. — — 1.1 Capturing Semantic Correlations Topic models posit a straightforward generative process that creates an observed corpus. For each docu- ment d, some distribution θd over unobserved topics is chosen. Then, for each word position in the document, a topic z is selected. Finally, the word for that position is generated by selecting from the topic indexed by z. (Recall that in LDA, a “topic” is a distribution over words). In monolingual topic models, the topic distribution is usually drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Using Dirichlet distributions makes it easy to specify sparse priors, and it also simplifies posterior inference because Dirichlet distributions are conjugate to multinomial distributions. However, drawing topics from Dirichlet distributions will not suffice if our vocabulary includes multiple languages. If we are working with English, German, and Chinese at the same time, a Dirichlet prior has no way to favor distributions z such that p(good|z), p(gut|z), and 1The latter property has also made LDA popular for information retrieval (Wei and Croft, 2006)). 46 p(h aˇo|z) all tend to be high at the same time, or low at hth ˇaeo same lti tmened. tMoo bree generally, et sheam structure oorf our model must encourage topics to be consistent across languages, and Dirichlet distributions cannot encode correlations between elements. One possible solution to this problem is to use the multivariate normal distribution, which can produce correlated multinomials (Blei and Lafferty, 2005), in place of the Dirichlet distribution. This has been done successfully in multilingual settings (Cohen and Smith, 2009). However, such models complicate inference by not being conjugate. Instead, we appeal to tree-based extensions of the Dirichlet distribution, which has been used to induce correlation in semantic ontologies (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007) and to encode clustering constraints (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). The key idea in this approach is to assume the vocabularies of all languages are organized according to some shared semantic structure that can be represented as a tree. For concreteness in this section, we will use WordNet (Miller, 1990) as the representation of this multilingual semantic bridge, since it is well known, offers convenient and intuitive terminology, and demonstrates the full flexibility of our approach. However, the model we describe generalizes to any tree-structured rep- resentation of multilingual knowledge; we discuss some alternatives in Section 3. WordNet organizes a vocabulary into a rooted, directed acyclic graph of nodes called synsets, short for “synonym sets.” A synset is a child of another synset if it satisfies a hyponomy relationship; each child “is a” more specific instantiation of its parent concept (thus, hyponomy is often called an “isa” relationship). For example, a “dog” is a “canine” is an “animal” is a “living thing,” etc. As an approximation, it is not unreasonable to assume that WordNet’s structure of meaning is language independent, i.e. the concept encoded by a synset can be realized using terms in different languages that share the same meaning. In practice, this organization has been used to create many alignments of international WordNets to the original English WordNet (Ordan and Wintner, 2007; Sagot and Fiˇ ser, 2008; Isahara et al., 2008). Using the structure of WordNet, we can now describe a generative process that produces a distribution over a multilingual vocabulary, which encourages correlations between words with similar meanings regardless of what language each word is in. For each synset h, we create a multilingual word distribution for that synset as follows: 1. Draw transition probabilities βh ∼ Dir (τh) 2. Draw stop probabilities ωh ∼ Dir∼ (κ Dhi)r 3. For each language l, draw emission probabilities for that synset φh,l ∼ Dir (πh,l) . For conciseness in the rest of the paper, we will refer to this generative process as multilingual Dirichlet hierarchy, or MULTDIRHIER(τ, κ, π) .2 Each observed token can be viewed as the end result of a sequence of visited synsets λ. At each node in the tree, the path can end at node iwith probability ωi,1, or it can continue to a child synset with probability ωi,0. If the path continues to another child synset, it visits child j with probability βi,j. If the path ends at a synset, it generates word k with probability φi,l,k.3 The probability of a word being emitted from a path with visited synsets r and final synset h in language lis therefore p(w, λ = r, h|l, β, ω, φ) = (iY,j)∈rβi,jωi,0(1 − ωh,1)φh,l,w. Note that the stop probability ωh (1) is independent of language, but the emission φh,l is dependent on the language. This is done to prevent the following scenario: while synset A is highly probable in a topic and words in language 1attached to that synset have high probability, words in language 2 have low probability. If this could happen for many synsets in a topic, an entire language would be effectively silenced, which would lead to inconsistent topics (e.g. 2Variables τh, πh,l, and κh are hyperparameters. Their mean is fixed, but their magnitude is sampled during inference (i.e. Pkτhτ,ih,k is constant, but τh,i is not). For the bushier bridges, (Pe.g. dictionary and flat), their mean is uniform. For GermaNet, we took frequencies from two balanced corpora of German and English: the British National Corpus (University of Oxford, 2006) and the Kern Corpus of the Digitales Wo¨rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache des 20. Jahrhunderts project (Geyken, 2007). We took these frequencies and propagated them through the multilingual hierarchy, following LDAWN’s (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007) formulation of information content (Resnik, 1995) as a Bayesian prior. The variance of the priors was initialized to be 1.0, but could be sampled during inference. 3Note that the language and word are taken as given, but the path through the semantic hierarchy is a latent random variable. 47 Topic 1 is about baseball in English and about travel in German). Separating path from emission helps ensure that topics are consistent across languages. Having defined topic distributions in a way that can preserve cross-language correspondences, we now use this distribution within a larger model that can discover cross-language patterns of use that predict sentiment. 1.2 The MLSLDA Model We will view sentiment analysis as a regression problem: given an input document, we want to predict a real-valued observation y that represents the sentiment of a document. Specifically, we build on supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (SLDA, (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007)), which makes predictions based on the topics expressed in a document; this can be thought of projecting the words in a document to low dimensional space of dimension equal to the number of topics. Blei et al. showed that using this latent topic structure can offer improved predictions over regressions based on words alone, and the approach fits well with our current goals, since word-level cues are unlikely to be identical across languages. In addition to text, SLDA has been successfully applied to other domains such as social networks (Chang and Blei, 2009) and image classification (Wang et al., 2009). The key innovation in this paper is to extend SLDA by creating topics that are globally consistent across languages, using the bridging approach above. We express our model in the form of a probabilistic generative latent-variable model that generates documents in multiple languages and assigns a realvalued score to each document. The score comes from a normal distribution whose sum is the dot product between a regression parameter η that encodes the influence of each topic on the observation and a variance σ2. With this model in hand, we use statistical inference to determine the distribution over latent variables that, given the model, best explains observed data. The generative model is as follows: 1. For each topic i= 1. . . K, draw a topic distribution {βi, ωi, φi} from MULTDIRHIER(τ, κ, π). 2. {Foβr each do}cuf mroemn tM Md = 1. . . M with language ld: (a) CDihro(oαse). a distribution over topics θd ∼ (b) For each word in the document n = 1. . . Nd, choose a topic assignment zd,n ∼ Mult (θd) and a path λd,n ending at word wd,n according to Equation 1using {βzd,n , ωzd,n , φzd,n }. 3. Choose a re?sponse variable from y Norm ?η> z¯, σ2?, where z¯ d ≡ N1 PnN=1 zd,n. ∼ Crucially, note that the topics are not independent of the sentiment task; the regression encourages terms with similar effects on the observation y to be in the same topic. The consistency of topics described above allows the same regression to be done for the entire corpus regardless of the language of the underlying document. 2 Inference Finding the model parameters most likely to explain the data is a problem of statistical inference. We employ stochastic EM (Diebolt and Ip, 1996), using a Gibbs sampler for the E-step to assign words to paths and topics. After randomly initializing the topics, we alternate between sampling the topic and path of a word (zd,n, λd,n) and finding the regression parameters η that maximize the likelihood. We jointly sample the topic and path conditioning on all of the other path and document assignments in the corpus, selecting a path and topic with probability p(zn = k, λn = r|z−n , λ−n, wn , η, σ, Θ) = p(yd|z, η, σ)p(λn = r|zn = k, λ−n, wn, τ, p(zn = k|z−n, α) . κ, π) (2) Each of these three terms reflects a different influence on the topics from the vocabulary structure, the document’s topics, and the response variable. In the next paragraphs, we will expand each of them to derive the full conditional topic distribution. As discussed in Section 1.1, the structure of the topic distribution encourages terms with the same meaning to be in the same topic, even across languages. During inference, we marginalize over possible multinomial distributions β, ω, and φ, using the observed transitions from ito j in topic k; Tk,i,j, stop counts in synset iin topic k, Ok,i,0; continue counts in synsets iin topic k, Ok,i,1 ; and emission counts in synset iin language lin topic k, Fk,i,l.

The conditional topic distribution for SLDA (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007) replaces this term with the standard Multinomial-Dirichlet. However, we believe this is the first published SLDA-style model using MCMC inference, as prior work has used variational inference (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007; Chang and Blei, 2009; Wang et al., 2009). Because the observed response variable depends on the topic assignments of a document, the conditional topic distribution is shifted toward topics that explain the observed response. Topics that move the predicted response yˆd toward the true yd will be favored.

<p>Author: Aurelien Max</p><p>Abstract: In this article, an original view on how to improve phrase translation estimates is proposed. This proposal is grounded on two main ideas: first, that appropriate examples of a given phrase should participate more in building its translation distribution; second, that paraphrases can be used to better estimate this distribution. Initial experiments provide evidence of the potential of our approach and its implementation for effectively improving translation performance.</p><p>3 0.14096566 <a title="105-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-PEM%3A_A_Paraphrase_Evaluation_Metric_Exploiting_Parallel_Texts.html">89 emnlp-2010-PEM: A Paraphrase Evaluation Metric Exploiting Parallel Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Chang Liu ; Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present PEM, the first fully automatic metric to evaluate the quality of paraphrases, and consequently, that of paraphrase generation systems. Our metric is based on three criteria: adequacy, fluency, and lexical dissimilarity. The key component in our metric is a robust and shallow semantic similarity measure based on pivot language N-grams that allows us to approximate adequacy independently of lexical similarity. Human evaluation shows that PEM achieves high correlation with human judgments.</p><p>4 0.13403225 <a title="105-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Facilitating_Translation_Using_Source_Language_Paraphrase_Lattices.html">50 emnlp-2010-Facilitating Translation Using Source Language Paraphrase Lattices</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinhua Du ; Jie Jiang ; Andy Way</p><p>Abstract: For resource-limited language pairs, coverage of the test set by the parallel corpus is an important factor that affects translation quality in two respects: 1) out of vocabulary words; 2) the same information in an input sentence can be expressed in different ways, while current phrase-based SMT systems cannot automatically select an alternative way to transfer the same information. Therefore, given limited data, in order to facilitate translation from the input side, this paper proposes a novel method to reduce the translation difficulty using source-side lattice-based paraphrases. We utilise the original phrases from the input sentence and the corresponding paraphrases to build a lattice with estimated weights for each edge to improve translation quality. Compared to the baseline system, our method achieves relative improvements of 7.07%, 6.78% and 3.63% in terms of BLEU score on small, medium and large- scale English-to-Chinese translation tasks respectively. The results show that the proposed method is effective not only for resourcelimited language pairs, but also for resourcesufficient pairs to some extent.</p><p>5 0.12962006 <a title="105-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Improving_Translation_via_Targeted_Paraphrasing.html">63 emnlp-2010-Improving Translation via Targeted Paraphrasing</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip Resnik ; Olivia Buzek ; Chang Hu ; Yakov Kronrod ; Alex Quinn ; Benjamin B. Bederson</p><p>Abstract: Targeted paraphrasing is a new approach to the problem of obtaining cost-effective, reasonable quality translation that makes use of simple and inexpensive human computations by monolingual speakers in combination with machine translation. The key insight behind the process is that it is possible to spot likely translation errors with only monolingual knowledge of the target language, and it is possible to generate alternative ways to say the same thing (i.e. paraphrases) with only monolingual knowledge of the source language. Evaluations demonstrate that this approach can yield substantial improvements in translation quality.</p><p>6 0.10185473 <a title="105-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Multi-Document_Summarization_Using_A%2A_Search_and_Discriminative_Learning.html">82 emnlp-2010-Multi-Document Summarization Using A* Search and Discriminative Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Ahmet Aker ; Trevor Cohn ; Robert Gaizauskas</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address two key challenges for extractive multi-document summarization: the search problem of finding the best scoring summary and the training problem of learning the best model parameters. We propose an A* search algorithm to find the best extractive summary up to a given length, which is both optimal and efficient to run. Further, we propose a discriminative training algorithm which directly maximises the quality ofthe best summary, rather than assuming a sentence-level decomposition as in earlier work. Our approach leads to significantly better results than earlier techniques across a number of evaluation metrics.</p><p>3 0.46308088 <a title="105-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2010-PEM%3A_A_Paraphrase_Evaluation_Metric_Exploiting_Parallel_Texts.html">89 emnlp-2010-PEM: A Paraphrase Evaluation Metric Exploiting Parallel Texts</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Paul ; ChengXiang Zhai ; Roxana Girju</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a two-stage approach to summarizing multiple contrastive viewpoints in opinionated text. In the first stage, we use an unsupervised probabilistic approach to model and extract multiple viewpoints in text. We experiment with a variety of lexical and syntactic features, yielding significant performance gains over bag-of-words feature sets. In the second stage, we introduce Comparative LexRank, a novel random walk formulation to score sentences and pairs of sentences from opposite viewpoints based on both their representativeness of the collection as well as their contrastiveness with each other. Exper- imental results show that the proposed approach can generate informative summaries of viewpoints in opinionated text.</p><p>5 0.40100199 <a title="105-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Learning_First-Order_Horn_Clauses_from_Web_Text.html">72 emnlp-2010-Learning First-Order Horn Clauses from Web Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Schoenmackers ; Jesse Davis ; Oren Etzioni ; Daniel Weld</p><p>Abstract: input. Even the entire Web corpus does not explicitly answer all questions, yet inference can uncover many implicit answers. But where do inference rules come from? This paper investigates the problem of learning inference rules from Web text in an unsupervised, domain-independent manner. The SHERLOCK system, described herein, is a first-order learner that acquires over 30,000 Horn clauses from Web text. SHERLOCK embodies several innovations, including a novel rule scoring function based on Statistical Relevance (Salmon et al., 1971) which is effective on ambiguous, noisy and incomplete Web extractions. Our experiments show that inference over the learned rules discovers three times as many facts (at precision 0.8) as the TEXTRUNNER system which merely extracts facts explicitly stated in Web text.</p><p>6 0.37181312 <a title="105-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Using_Universal_Linguistic_Knowledge_to_Guide_Grammar_Induction.html">116 emnlp-2010-Using Universal Linguistic Knowledge to Guide Grammar Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Samuel Brody</p><p>Abstract: We reveal a previously unnoticed connection between dependency parsing and statistical machine translation (SMT), by formulating the dependency parsing task as a problem of word alignment. Furthermore, we show that two well known models for these respective tasks (DMV and the IBM models) share common modeling assumptions. This motivates us to develop an alignment-based framework for unsupervised dependency parsing. The framework (which will be made publicly available) is flexible, modular and easy to extend. Using this framework, we implement several algorithms based on the IBM alignment models, which prove surprisingly effective on the dependency parsing task, and demonstrate the potential of the alignment-based approach.</p><p>3 0.50147176 <a title="105-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Unsupervised_Induction_of_Tree_Substitution_Grammars_for_Dependency_Parsing.html">113 emnlp-2010-Unsupervised Induction of Tree Substitution Grammars for Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Phil Blunsom ; Trevor Cohn</p><p>Abstract: Inducing a grammar directly from text is one of the oldest and most challenging tasks in Computational Linguistics. Significant progress has been made for inducing dependency grammars, however the models employed are overly simplistic, particularly in comparison to supervised parsing models. In this paper we present an approach to dependency grammar induction using tree substitution grammar which is capable of learning large dependency fragments and thereby better modelling the text. We define a hierarchical non-parametric Pitman-Yor Process prior which biases towards a small grammar with simple productions. This approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art, when measured by head attachment accuracy.</p><p>4 0.48350632 <a title="105-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Using_Universal_Linguistic_Knowledge_to_Guide_Grammar_Induction.html">116 emnlp-2010-Using Universal Linguistic Knowledge to Guide Grammar Induction</a></p>
<p>Author: Tahira Naseem ; Harr Chen ; Regina Barzilay ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to grammar induction that utilizes syntactic universals to improve dependency parsing across a range of languages. Our method uses a single set of manually-specified language-independent rules that identify syntactic dependencies between pairs of syntactic categories that commonly occur across languages. During inference of the probabilistic model, we use posterior expectation constraints to require that a minimum proportion of the dependencies we infer be instances of these rules. We also automatically refine the syntactic categories given in our coarsely tagged input. Across six languages our approach outperforms state-of-theart unsupervised methods by a significant margin.1</p><p>5 0.47201958 <a title="105-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Fast_Fertility_Hidden_Markov_Model_for_Word_Alignment_Using_MCMC.html">3 emnlp-2010-A Fast Fertility Hidden Markov Model for Word Alignment Using MCMC</a></p>
<p>Author: Shaojun Zhao ; Daniel Gildea</p><p>Abstract: A word in one language can be translated to zero, one, or several words in other languages. Using word fertility features has been shown to be useful in building word alignment models for statistical machine translation. We built a fertility hidden Markov model by adding fertility to the hidden Markov model. This model not only achieves lower alignment error rate than the hidden Markov model, but also runs faster. It is similar in some ways to IBM Model 4, but is much easier to understand. We use Gibbs sampling for parameter estimation, which is more principled than the neighborhood method used in IBM Model 4.</p><p>6 0.45665497 <a title="105-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Multi-Pass_Sieve_for_Coreference_Resolution.html">8 emnlp-2010-A Multi-Pass Sieve for Coreference Resolution</a></p>

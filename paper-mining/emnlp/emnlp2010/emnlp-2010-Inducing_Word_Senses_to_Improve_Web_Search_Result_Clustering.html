<p>Author: Yunliang Jiang ; Cindy Xide Lin ; Qiaozhu Mei</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we conducted a systematic comparative analysis of language in different contexts of bursty topics, including web search, news media, blogging, and social bookmarking. We analyze (1) the content similarity and predictability between contexts, (2) the coverage of search content by each context, and (3) the intrinsic coherence of information in each context. Our experiments show that social bookmarking is a better predictor to the bursty search queries, but news media and social blogging media have a much more compelling coverage. This comparison provides insights on how the search behaviors and social information sharing behaviors of users are correlated to the professional news media in the context of bursty events.</p><p>4 0.17469418 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based_Stratified_Seed_Sampling_for_Semi-Supervised_Relation_Classification.html">27 emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based Stratified Seed Sampling for Semi-Supervised Relation Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Longhua Qian ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Seed sampling is critical in semi-supervised learning. This paper proposes a clusteringbased stratified seed sampling approach to semi-supervised learning. First, various clustering algorithms are explored to partition the unlabeled instances into different strata with each stratum represented by a center. Then, diversity-motivated intra-stratum sampling is adopted to choose the center and additional instances from each stratum to form the unlabeled seed set for an oracle to annotate. Finally, the labeled seed set is fed into a bootstrapping procedure as the initial labeled data. We systematically evaluate our stratified bootstrapping approach in the semantic relation classification subtask of the ACE RDC (Relation Detection and Classification) task. In particular, we compare various clustering algorithms on the stratified bootstrapping performance. Experimental results on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus show that our clusteringbased stratified bootstrapping approach achieves the best F1-score of 75.9 on the subtask of semantic relation classification, approaching the one with golden clustering.</p><p>5 0.16780898 <a title="66-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Two_Decades_of_Unsupervised_POS_Induction%3A_How_Far_Have_We_Come%3F.html">111 emnlp-2010-Two Decades of Unsupervised POS Induction: How Far Have We Come?</a></p>
<p>Author: Christos Christodoulopoulos ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) induction is one of the most popular tasks in research on unsupervised NLP. Many different methods have been proposed, yet comparisons are difficult to make since there is little consensus on evaluation framework, and many papers evaluate against only one or two competitor systems. Here we evaluate seven different POS induction systems spanning nearly 20 years of work, using a variety of measures. We show that some of the oldest (and simplest) systems stand up surprisingly well against more recent approaches. Since most of these systems were developed and tested using data from the WSJ corpus, we compare their generalization abil- ities by testing on both WSJ and the multilingual Multext-East corpus. Finally, we introduce the idea of evaluating systems based on their ability to produce cluster prototypes that are useful as input to a prototype-driven learner. In most cases, the prototype-driven learner outperforms the unsupervised system used to initialize it, yielding state-of-the-art results on WSJ and improvements on nonEnglish corpora.</p><p>6 0.15941235 <a title="66-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Word_Sense_Induction__Disambiguation_Using_Hierarchical_Random_Graphs.html">124 emnlp-2010-Word Sense Induction  Disambiguation Using Hierarchical Random Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Ioannis Klapaftis ; Suresh Manandhar</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based methods have gained attention in many areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) including Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), text summarization, keyword extraction and others. Most of the work in these areas formulate their problem in a graph-based setting and apply unsupervised graph clustering to obtain a set of clusters. Recent studies suggest that graphs often exhibit a hierarchical structure that goes beyond simple flat clustering. This paper presents an unsupervised method for inferring the hierarchical grouping of the senses of a polysemous word. The inferred hierarchical structures are applied to the problem of word sense disambiguation, where we show that our method performs sig- nificantly better than traditional graph-based methods and agglomerative clustering yielding improvements over state-of-the-art WSD systems based on sense induction.</p><p>5 0.60674208 <a title="66-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based_Stratified_Seed_Sampling_for_Semi-Supervised_Relation_Classification.html">27 emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based Stratified Seed Sampling for Semi-Supervised Relation Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Shane Bergsma ; Aditya Bhargava ; Hua He ; Grzegorz Kondrak</p><p>Abstract: In many applications, replacing a complex word form by its stem can reduce sparsity, revealing connections in the data that would not otherwise be apparent. In this paper, we focus on prefix verbs: verbs formed by adding a prefix to an existing verb stem. A prefix verb is considered compositional if it can be decomposed into a semantically equivalent expression involving its stem. We develop a classifier to predict compositionality via a range of lexical and distributional features, including novel features derived from web-scale Ngram data. Results on a new annotated corpus show that prefix verb compositionality can be predicted with high accuracy. Our system also performs well when trained and tested on conventional morphological segmentations of prefix verbs.</p><p>3 0.35346624 <a title="66-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Learning_Recurrent_Event_Queries_for_Web_Search.html">73 emnlp-2010-Learning Recurrent Event Queries for Web Search</a></p>

Experiments on a commercial Web search engine also show significant gains in overall relevance, and thus overall user experience.</p><p>4 0.35010785 <a title="66-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Efficient_Graph-Based_Semi-Supervised_Learning_of_Structured_Tagging_Models.html">41 emnlp-2010-Efficient Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning of Structured Tagging Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Amarnag Subramanya ; Slav Petrov ; Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new scalable algorithm for semi-supervised training of conditional random fields (CRF) and its application to partof-speech (POS) tagging. The algorithm uses a similarity graph to encourage similar ngrams to have similar POS tags. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a domain adaptation task, where we assume that we have access to large amounts of unlabeled data from the target domain, but no additional labeled data. The similarity graph is used during training to smooth the state posteriors on the target domain. Standard inference can be used at test time. Our approach is able to scale to very large problems and yields significantly improved target domain accuracy.</p><p>5 0.34541422 <a title="66-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Word_Sense_Induction__Disambiguation_Using_Hierarchical_Random_Graphs.html">124 emnlp-2010-Word Sense Induction  Disambiguation Using Hierarchical Random Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Klapaftis ; Suresh Manandhar</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based methods have gained attention in many areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) including Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), text summarization, keyword extraction and others. Most of the work in these areas formulate their problem in a graph-based setting and apply unsupervised graph clustering to obtain a set of clusters. Recent studies suggest that graphs often exhibit a hierarchical structure that goes beyond simple flat clustering. This paper presents an unsupervised method for inferring the hierarchical grouping of the senses of a polysemous word. The inferred hierarchical structures are applied to the problem of word sense disambiguation, where we show that our method performs sig- nificantly better than traditional graph-based methods and agglomerative clustering yielding improvements over state-of-the-art WSD systems based on sense induction.</p><p>6 0.336184 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Nouns_are_Vectors%2C_Adjectives_are_Matrices%3A_Representing_Adjective-Noun_Constructions_in_Semantic_Space.html">87 emnlp-2010-Nouns are Vectors, Adjectives are Matrices: Representing Adjective-Noun Constructions in Semantic Space</a></p>

<p>Author: Dave Golland ; Percy Liang ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Language is sensitive to both semantic and pragmatic effects. To capture both effects, we model language use as a cooperative game between two players: a speaker, who generates an utterance, and a listener, who responds with an action. Specifically, we consider the task of generating spatial references to objects, wherein the listener must accurately identify an object described by the speaker. We show that a speaker model that acts optimally with respect to an explicit, embedded listener model substantially outperforms one that is trained to directly generate spatial descriptions.</p><p>4 0.082912996 <a title="53-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Towards_Conversation_Entailment%3A_An_Empirical_Investigation.html">107 emnlp-2010-Towards Conversation Entailment: An Empirical Investigation</a></p>
<p>Author: Chen Zhang ; Joyce Chai</p><p>Abstract: While a significant amount of research has been devoted to textual entailment, automated entailment from conversational scripts has received less attention. To address this limitation, this paper investigates the problem of conversation entailment: automated inference of hypotheses from conversation scripts. We examine two levels of semantic representations: a basic representation based on syntactic parsing from conversation utterances and an augmented representation taking into consideration of conversation structures. For each of these levels, we further explore two ways of capturing long distance relations between language constituents: implicit modeling based on the length of distance and explicit modeling based on actual patterns of relations. Our empirical findings have shown that the augmented representation with conversation structures is important, which achieves the best performance when combined with explicit modeling of long distance relations.</p><p>5 0.058923855 <a title="53-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Better_Punctuation_Prediction_with_Dynamic_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">25 emnlp-2010-Better Punctuation Prediction with Dynamic Conditional Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Lu ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of inserting punctuation symbols into transcribed conversational speech texts, without relying on prosodic cues. We investigate limitations associated with previous methods, and propose a novel approach based on dynamic conditional random fields. Different from previous work, our proposed approach is designed to jointly perform both sentence boundary and sentence type prediction, and punctuation prediction on speech utterances. We performed evaluations on a transcribed conversational speech domain consisting of both English and Chinese texts. Empirical results show that our method outperforms an approach based on linear-chain conditional random fields and other previous approaches.</p><p>6 0.05539605 <a title="53-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-NLP_on_Spoken_Documents_Without_ASR.html">84 emnlp-2010-NLP on Spoken Documents Without ASR</a></p>

<p>Author: Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a unified framework for zero anaphora resolution, which can be divided into three sub-tasks: zero anaphor detection, anaphoricity determination and antecedent identification. In particular, all the three sub-tasks are addressed using tree kernel-based methods with appropriate syntactic parse tree structures. Experimental results on a Chinese zero anaphora corpus show that the proposed tree kernel-based methods significantly outperform the feature-based ones. This indicates the critical role of the structural information in zero anaphora resolution and the necessity of tree kernel-based methods in modeling such structural information. To our best knowledge, this is the first systematic work dealing with all the three sub-tasks in Chinese zero anaphora resolution via a unified framework. Moreover, we release a Chinese zero anaphora corpus of 100 documents, which adds a layer of annotation to the manu- ally-parsed sentences in the Chinese Treebank (CTB) 6.0.</p><p>5 0.2436647 <a title="53-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Towards_Conversation_Entailment%3A_An_Empirical_Investigation.html">107 emnlp-2010-Towards Conversation Entailment: An Empirical Investigation</a></p>

<p>Author: Adria de Gispert ; Juan Pino ; William Byrne</p><p>Abstract: We report on investigations into hierarchical phrase-based translation grammars based on rules extracted from posterior distributions over alignments of the parallel text. Rather than restrict rule extraction to a single alignment, such as Viterbi, we instead extract rules based on posterior distributions provided by the HMM word-to-word alignmentmodel. We define translation grammars progressively by adding classes of rules to a basic phrase-based system. We assess these grammars in terms of their expressive power, measured by their ability to align the parallel text from which their rules are extracted, and the quality of the translations they yield. In Chinese-to-English translation, we find that rule extraction from posteriors gives translation improvements. We also find that grammars with rules with only one nonterminal, when extracted from posteri- ors, can outperform more complex grammars extracted from Viterbi alignments. Finally, we show that the best way to exploit source-totarget and target-to-source alignment models is to build two separate systems and combine their output translation lattices.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.71462774 <a title="53-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2010-Fusing_Eye_Gaze_with_Speech_Recognition_Hypotheses_to_Resolve_Exophoric_References_in_Situated_Dialogue.html">53 emnlp-2010-Fusing Eye Gaze with Speech Recognition Hypotheses to Resolve Exophoric References in Situated Dialogue</a></p>

<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Chris Dyer ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: We address the modeling, parameter estimation and search challenges that arise from the introduction of reordering models that capture non-local reordering in alignment modeling. In particular, we introduce several reordering models that utilize (pairs of) function words as contexts for alignment reordering. To address the parameter estimation challenge, we propose to estimate these reordering models from a relatively small amount of manuallyaligned corpora. To address the search challenge, we devise an iterative local search algorithm that stochastically explores reordering possibilities. By capturing non-local reordering phenomena, our proposed alignment model bears a closer resemblance to stateof-the-art translation model. Empirical results show significant improvements in alignment quality as well as in translation performance over baselines in a large-scale ChineseEnglish translation task.</p><p>4 0.5884617 <a title="53-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Maximum_Entropy_Based_Phrase_Reordering_for_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation.html">76 emnlp-2010-Maximum Entropy Based Phrase Reordering for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongjun He ; Yao Meng ; Hao Yu</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) translation provides a powerful mechanism to capture both short and long distance phrase reorderings. However, the phrase reorderings lack of contextual information in conventional HPB systems. This paper proposes a contextdependent phrase reordering approach that uses the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to help the HPB decoder select appropriate reordering patterns. We classify translation rules into several reordering patterns, and build a MaxEnt model for each pattern based on various contextual features. We integrate the MaxEnt models into the HPB model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant improvements over a standard HPB system on large-scale translation tasks. On Chinese-to-English translation, , the absolute improvements in BLEU (caseinsensitive) range from 1.2 to 2.1.</p><p>5 0.50588751 <a title="53-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Soft_Syntactic_Constraints_for_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation_Using_Latent_Syntactic_Distributions.html">98 emnlp-2010-Soft Syntactic Constraints for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation Using Latent Syntactic Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongqiang Huang ; Martin Cmejrek ; Bowen Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to enhance hierarchical phrase-based machine translation systems with linguistically motivated syntactic features. Rather than directly using treebank categories as in previous studies, we learn a set of linguistically-guided latent syntactic categories automatically from a source-side parsed, word-aligned parallel corpus, based on the hierarchical structure among phrase pairs as well as the syntactic structure of the source side. In our model, each X nonterminal in a SCFG rule is decorated with a real-valued feature vector computed based on its distribution of latent syntactic categories. These feature vectors are utilized at decod- ing time to measure the similarity between the syntactic analysis of the source side and the syntax of the SCFG rules that are applied to derive translations. Our approach maintains the advantages of hierarchical phrase-based translation systems while at the same time naturally incorporates soft syntactic constraints.</p><p>6 0.45231521 <a title="53-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-SCFG_Decoding_Without_Binarization.html">94 emnlp-2010-SCFG Decoding Without Binarization</a></p>

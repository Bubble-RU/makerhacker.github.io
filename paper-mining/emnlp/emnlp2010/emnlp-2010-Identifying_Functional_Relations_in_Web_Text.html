<p>Author: Stefan Schoenmackers ; Jesse Davis ; Oren Etzioni ; Daniel Weld</p><p>Abstract: input. Even the entire Web corpus does not explicitly answer all questions, yet inference can uncover many implicit answers. But where do inference rules come from? This paper investigates the problem of learning inference rules from Web text in an unsupervised, domain-independent manner. The SHERLOCK system, described herein, is a first-order learner that acquires over 30,000 Horn clauses from Web text. SHERLOCK embodies several innovations, including a novel rule scoring function based on Statistical Relevance (Salmon et al., 1971) which is effective on ambiguous, noisy and incomplete Web extractions. Our experiments show that inference over the learned rules discovers three times as many facts (at precision 0.8) as the TEXTRUNNER system which merely extracts facts explicitly stated in Web text.</p><p>3 0.049399298 <a title="59-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Practical_Linguistic_Steganography_Using_Contextual_Synonym_Substitution_and_Vertex_Colour_Coding.html">91 emnlp-2010-Practical Linguistic Steganography Using Contextual Synonym Substitution and Vertex Colour Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Ching-Yun Chang ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: Linguistic Steganography is concerned with hiding information in natural language text. One of the major transformations used in Linguistic Steganography is synonym substitution. However, few existing studies have studied the practical application of this approach. In this paper we propose two improvements to the use of synonym substitution for encoding hidden bits of information. First, we use the Web 1T Google n-gram corpus for checking the applicability of a synonym in context, and we evaluate this method using data from the SemEval lexical substitution task. Second, we address the problem that arises from words with more than one sense, which creates a potential ambiguity in terms of which bits are encoded by a particular word. We develop a novel method in which words are the vertices in a graph, synonyms are linked by edges, and the bits assigned to a word are determined by a vertex colouring algorithm. This method ensures that each word encodes a unique sequence of bits, without cutting out large number of synonyms, and thus maintaining a reasonable embedding capacity.</p><p>4 0.047699943 <a title="59-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Constraints_Based_Taxonomic_Relation_Classification.html">31 emnlp-2010-Constraints Based Taxonomic Relation Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Quang Do ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Determining whether two terms in text have an ancestor relation (e.g. Toyota and car) or a sibling relation (e.g. Toyota and Honda) is an essential component of textual inference in NLP applications such as Question Answering, Summarization, and Recognizing Textual Entailment. Significant work has been done on developing stationary knowledge sources that could potentially support these tasks, but these resources often suffer from low coverage, noise, and are inflexible when needed to support terms that are not identical to those placed in them, making their use as general purpose background knowledge resources difficult. In this paper, rather than building a stationary hierarchical structure of terms and relations, we describe a system that, given two terms, determines the taxonomic relation between them using a machine learning-based approach that makes use of existing resources. Moreover, we develop a global constraint opti- mization inference process and use it to leverage an existing knowledge base also to enforce relational constraints among terms and thus improve the classifier predictions. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms other systems built upon existing well-known knowledge sources.</p><p>5 0.045520626 <a title="59-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Unified_Framework_for_Scope_Learning_via_Simplified_Shallow_Semantic_Parsing.html">15 emnlp-2010-A Unified Framework for Scope Learning via Simplified Shallow Semantic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiaoming Zhu ; Junhui Li ; Hongling Wang ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: This paper approaches the scope learning problem via simplified shallow semantic parsing. This is done by regarding the cue as the predicate and mapping its scope into several constituents as the arguments of the cue. Evaluation on the BioScope corpus shows that the structural information plays a critical role in capturing the relationship between a cue and its dominated arguments. It also shows that our parsing approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art chunking ones. Although our parsing approach is only evaluated on negation and speculation scope learning here, it is portable to other kinds of scope learning. 1</p><p>6 0.043729831 <a title="59-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Collective_Cross-Document_Relation_Extraction_Without_Labelled_Data.html">28 emnlp-2010-Collective Cross-Document Relation Extraction Without Labelled Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a unified framework for zero anaphora resolution, which can be divided into three sub-tasks: zero anaphor detection, anaphoricity determination and antecedent identification. In particular, all the three sub-tasks are addressed using tree kernel-based methods with appropriate syntactic parse tree structures. Experimental results on a Chinese zero anaphora corpus show that the proposed tree kernel-based methods significantly outperform the feature-based ones. This indicates the critical role of the structural information in zero anaphora resolution and the necessity of tree kernel-based methods in modeling such structural information. To our best knowledge, this is the first systematic work dealing with all the three sub-tasks in Chinese zero anaphora resolution via a unified framework. Moreover, we release a Chinese zero anaphora corpus of 100 documents, which adds a layer of annotation to the manu- ally-parsed sentences in the Chinese Treebank (CTB) 6.0.</p><p>5 0.31738037 <a title="59-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Collective_Cross-Document_Relation_Extraction_Without_Labelled_Data.html">28 emnlp-2010-Collective Cross-Document Relation Extraction Without Labelled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to relation extraction that integrates information across documents, performs global inference and requires no labelled text. In particular, we tackle relation extraction and entity identification jointly. We use distant supervision to train a factor graph model for relation extraction based on an existing knowledge base (Freebase, derived in parts from Wikipedia). For inference we run an efficient Gibbs sampler that leads to linear time joint inference. We evaluate our approach both for an indomain (Wikipedia) and a more realistic outof-domain (New York Times Corpus) setting. For the in-domain setting, our joint model leads to 4% higher precision than an isolated local approach, but has no advantage over a pipeline. For the out-of-domain data, we benefit strongly from joint modelling, and observe improvements in precision of 13% over the pipeline, and 15% over the isolated baseline.</p><p>6 0.23420903 <a title="59-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Fusing_Eye_Gaze_with_Speech_Recognition_Hypotheses_to_Resolve_Exophoric_References_in_Situated_Dialogue.html">53 emnlp-2010-Fusing Eye Gaze with Speech Recognition Hypotheses to Resolve Exophoric References in Situated Dialogue</a></p>

<p>Author: Libin Shen ; Bing Zhang ; Spyros Matsoukas ; Jinxi Xu ; Ralph Weischedel</p><p>Abstract: In modern machine translation practice, a statistical phrasal or hierarchical translation system usually relies on a huge set of translation rules extracted from bi-lingual training data. This approach not only results in space and efficiency issues, but also suffers from the sparse data problem. In this paper, we propose to use factorized grammars, an idea widely accepted in the field of linguistic grammar construction, to generalize translation rules, so as to solve these two problems. We designed a method to take advantage of the XTAG English Grammar to facilitate the extraction of factorized rules. We experimented on various setups of low-resource language translation, and showed consistent significant improvement in BLEU over state-ofthe-art string-to-dependency baseline systems with 200K words of bi-lingual training data.</p><p>3 0.50229216 <a title="59-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Translingual_Document_Representations_from_Discriminative_Projections.html">109 emnlp-2010-Translingual Document Representations from Discriminative Projections</a></p>

We explore two variants to create these projections: Oriented Principal Component Analysis (OPCA) and Coupled Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (CPLSA). Both of these variants start with a basic model of documents (PCA and PLSA). Each model is then made discriminative by encouraging comparable document pairs to have similar vector representations. We evaluate these algorithms on two tasks: parallel document retrieval for Wikipedia and Europarl documents, and cross-lingual text classification on Reuters. The two discriminative variants, OPCA and CPLSA, significantly outperform their corre- sponding baselines. The largest differences in performance are observed on the task of retrieval when the documents are only comparable and not parallel. The OPCA method is shown to perform best.</p><p>4 0.28340268 <a title="59-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Positional_Language_Models_for_Clinical_Information_Retrieval.html">90 emnlp-2010-Positional Language Models for Clinical Information Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Florian Boudin ; Jian-Yun Nie ; Martin Dawes</p><p>Abstract: The PECO framework is a knowledge representation for formulating clinical questions. Queries are decomposed into four aspects, which are Patient-Problem (P), Exposure (E), Comparison (C) and Outcome (O). However, no test collection is available to evaluate such framework in information retrieval. In this work, we first present the construction of a large test collection extracted from systematic literature reviews. We then describe an analysis of the distribution of PECO elements throughout the relevant documents and propose a language modeling approach that uses these distributions as a weighting strategy. In our experiments carried out on a collection of 1.5 million documents and 423 queries, our method was found to lead to an improvement of 28% in MAP and 50% in P@5, as com- pared to the state-of-the-art method.</p><p>5 0.24449238 <a title="59-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Joint_Inference_for_Bilingual_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">68 emnlp-2010-Joint Inference for Bilingual Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Tao Zhuang ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: We show that jointly performing semantic role labeling (SRL) on bitext can improve SRL results on both sides. In our approach, we use monolingual SRL systems to produce argument candidates for predicates in bitext at first. Then, we simultaneously generate SRL results for two sides of bitext using our joint inference model. Our model prefers the bilingual SRL result that is not only reasonable on each side of bitext, but also has more consistent argument structures between two sides. To evaluate the consistency between two argument structures, we also formulate a log-linear model to compute the probability of aligning two arguments. We have experimented with our model on Chinese-English parallel PropBank data. Using our joint inference model, F1 scores of SRL results on Chinese and English text achieve 79.53% and 77.87% respectively, which are 1.52 and 1.74 points higher than the results of baseline monolingual SRL combination systems respectively.</p><p>6 0.24037786 <a title="59-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Learning_First-Order_Horn_Clauses_from_Web_Text.html">72 emnlp-2010-Learning First-Order Horn Clauses from Web Text</a></p>

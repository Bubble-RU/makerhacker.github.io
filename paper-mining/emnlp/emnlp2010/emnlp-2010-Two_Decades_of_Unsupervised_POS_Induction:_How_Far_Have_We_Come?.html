</p><p>6 uk the relative performance of unsupervised POS tagging systems because of differences in evaluation measures, and the fact that no paper includes direct comparisons against more than a few other systems. [sent-20, score-0.253]
</p><p>7 In this paper, we attempt to remedy that situation by providing a comprehensive evaluation of seven different POS induction systems spanning nearly 20 years of research. [sent-21, score-0.282]
</p><p>8 We focus specifically on POS induction systems, where no prior knowledge is available, in contrast to POS disambiguation systems (Merialdo, 1994; Toutanova and Johnson, 2007; Naseem et al. [sent-22, score-0.247]
</p><p>9 , 2009; Ravi and Knight, 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2005), which use a dictionary to provide possible tags for some or all of the words in the corpus, or prototype-driven systems (Haghighi and Klein, 2006), which use a small set of prototypes for each tag class, but no dictionary. [sent-23, score-0.631]
</p><p>10 Our motivation stems from another part of our own research, in which we are trying to use NLP systems on over 50 low-density languages (some of them dead) where both tagged corpora and language speakers are mostly unavailable. [sent-24, score-0.154]
</p><p>11 Nevertheless, most recent papers have used mapping-based performance measures (either oneto-one or many-to-one accuracy). [sent-27, score-0.164]
</p><p>12 Using V-Measure along with several other evaluation measures, we compare the performance of the different induction systems on both WSJ (the data on which most systems were developed and tested) and Multext East, a corpus of parallel texts in eight different languages. [sent-31, score-0.362]
</p><p>13 We find that for virtually all measures and datasets, older systems using relatively  simple models and algorithms (Brown et al. [sent-32, score-0.281]
</p><p>14 , 1992; Clark, 2003) work as well or better than systems using newer and often far more sophisticated and time-consuming machine learning methods (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007; Graca et al. [sent-33, score-0.221]
</p><p>15 Thus, although these newer methods have introduced potentially useful machine learning techniques, they should not be assumed to provide the best performance for unsupervised POS induction. [sent-36, score-0.218]
</p><p>16 In addition to our review and comparison, we introduce a new way to both evaluate and potentially improve a POS induction system. [sent-37, score-0.167]
</p><p>17 Our method is based on the prototype-driven learning system of Haghighi and Klein (2006), which achieves very good performance by using a hand-selected list of prototypes for each syntactic cluster. [sent-38, score-0.482]
</p><p>18 We instead use the existing POS induction systems to induce prototypes automatically, and evaluate the systems based on the quality of their prototypes. [sent-39, score-0.794]
</p><p>19 We find that the oldest system tested (Brown et al. [sent-40, score-0.177]
</p><p>20 , 1992) produces the best prototypes, and that using these prototypes as input to Haghighi and Klein’s system yields stateof-the-art performance on WSJ and improvements on seven of the eight non-English corpora. [sent-41, score-0.552]
</p><p>21 Each system outputs a set of syntactic clusters C; except where noted, the target number of clusters |C| must be specified as an input parameter. [sent-43, score-0.549]
</p><p>22 This is the oldest and one of the simplest systems we tested. [sent-47, score-0.197]
</p><p>23 This system uses a similar model to the previous one, and also clusters word types (rather than tokens, as the rest of the systems do). [sent-55, score-0.378]
</p><p>24 The main differences between the systems are that clark uses a slightly different approximate search procedure, and that he augments the probabilistic model with a prior that prefers clusterings where morphologically similar words are clustered together. [sent-56, score-0.348]
</p><p>25 The first clusters the most frequent 10,000 words (target words) based on their context statistics, with contexts formed from the most frequent 150-250 words (feature words) that appear ei1Implementations  were  obtained from:  brown: http : / /www . [sent-62, score-0.251]
</p><p>26 The final clustering is  of the clusters obtained in the two  While the number of target words, feature  words, and window size are in principle parameters of the algorithm, they are hard-coded in the implementation we used and we did not change them. [sent-86, score-0.322]
</p><p>27 The Dirichlet hyperparameters α (which controls the sparsity of the transition probabilities) and β (which controls the sparsity of the emission probabilities) can be fixed or inferred. [sent-90, score-0.199]
</p><p>28 This system, while utilizing the same bigram HMM, encourages sparsity directly by constraining the posterior distributions using the posterior regularization framework (Ganchev et al. [sent-100, score-0.155]
</p><p>29 3  Evaluation Measures  One difficulty in comparing POS induction methods is in finding an appropriate evaluation measure. [sent-111, score-0.167]
</p><p>30 In addition, some measures with supposed theoretical advantages, such as Variation ofInformation (VI) (Meil ˇa, 2003) have had little empirical analysis. [sent-113, score-0.165]
</p><p>31 Our goal in this section is to determine which  of these measures is most sensible for evaluating the systems presented above. [sent-114, score-0.25]
</p><p>32 Except for VI, all measures range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better performance. [sent-116, score-0.174]
</p><p>33 [many-to-1]: Many-to-one mapping accuracy (also known as cluster purity) maps each cluster to the gold standard tag that is most common for the words in that cluster (henceforth, the preferred tag), and then computes the proportion of words tagged correctly. [sent-117, score-0.591]
</p><p>34 More than one cluster may be mapped to the same gold standard tag. [sent-118, score-0.271]
</p><p>35 In this measure, the first half of the corpus is used to obtain the many-to-one mapping of clusters to tags,  and this mapping is used to compute the accuracy of the clustering on the second half of the corpus. [sent-122, score-0.396]
</p><p>36 [1-to-1]: One-to-one mapping accuracy (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) constrains the mapping from clusters to tags, so that at most one cluster can be mapped to any tag. [sent-123, score-0.447]
</p><p>37 In general, as the number of clusters increases, fewer clusters will be mapped to their preferred tag and scores will decrease (especially if the number of clusters is larger than the number of tags, so that some clusters are unassigned and receive zero credit). [sent-125, score-1.088]
</p><p>38 [vi]: Variation of Information (Meil ˇa, 2003) is an information-theoretic measure that regards the system output C and the gold standard tags T as two separate clusterings, and evaluates the amount of information lost in going from C to T and the amount of information gained, i. [sent-127, score-0.273]
</p><p>39 VI and other entropy-based measures have  been argued to be superior to accuracy-based measures such as those above, because they consider not only the majority tag in each cluster, but also whether the remainder of the cluster is more or less homogeneous. [sent-134, score-0.419]
</p><p>40 Unlike the other measures we consider, lower scores are better (since VI measures the difference between clusterings in bits). [sent-135, score-0.387]
</p><p>41 They noted that  V-Measure favors clusterings where the number of clusters |C| is larger than the number of POS tags |cTlu| . [sent-139, score-0.412]
</p><p>42 One potential issue with all ofthe above measures is that they require a gold standard tagging to compute. [sent-144, score-0.326]
</p><p>43 This is normally available during development of a system, but if the system is deployed on a novel language a gold standard may not be available. [sent-145, score-0.196]
</p><p>44 578 In addition, there is the question of whether the gold standard itself is “correct”. [sent-146, score-0.149]
</p><p>45 (2009) proposed this novel evaluation measure that requires no gold standard, instead using the concept of substitutability to evaluate performance. [sent-148, score-0.16]
</p><p>46 Instead of comparing the system’s clusters C to gold standard clusters T, they are compared to a set of clusters S created from substitutable frames, i. [sent-149, score-1.019]
</p><p>47 , clusters of words that occur in the same syntactic environment. [sent-151, score-0.251]
</p><p>48 First, we examine the effects of varying |C| on mthes b Feihrsavt,io wre o exf atmhei neev athluea etifofnec measures, wgh |iCle| keeping the number of gold standard tags the same  (|T|  =  45). [sent-164, score-0.226]

</p><p>50 One might hope that the peak in performance would occur when the number of clusters is approximately equal to the number of gold standard tags; however, the best performance for both 1-to-1 and vi occurs with approximately 25-30 clusters, many fewer than the gold standard 45. [sent-197, score-0.659]
</p><p>51 Interestingly, although vmb was proposed as a way to correct for the supposed tendency of vm to increase with increasing |C|, we find that vm is actually more stable than ivnmgb |C over edi ffinfedre thnat tv vamlue iss oacft |uCal|l . [sent-199, score-0.487]
</p><p>52 dTi fhfeurse,n itf n thume gbeorasl  of clusters (especially important for systems that induce the number of clusters), then vm seems more appropriate than any of the above measures, which are more standard in the literature. [sent-201, score-0.583]
</p><p>53 oIts assigns a tlo vwaleure score Cto| tahfete supervised system than to brown, indicating that words in the supervised clusters (which are very close to the gold standard) are actually less substitutable than words in the unsupervised clusters. [sent-204, score-0.641]
</p><p>54 This is probably due to the fact that the gold standard encodes “pure” syntactic classes, while substitutability also depends on semantic characteristics (which tend to be picked up by unsupervised clustering systems as well). [sent-205, score-0.424]
</p><p>55 If a gold –  standard is available, then many-to-1 and 1-to-1 are the most intuitive measures, but should not be used when |C| is variable, and do not account for differences |inC t|h ies errors lme,ad aned. [sent-208, score-0.149]
</p><p>56 Overall, vm seems to pbae tahbei bityest a general-purpose measure lt,h vamt co semebmins teos an entropy-based score with an intuitive 0-1 scale and stability over a wide range of |C| . [sent-210, score-0.184]
</p><p>57 This is a particularly pertinent question since a primary argument in favor of unsupervised systems is that they are easier to port to a new language  or domain than supervised systems. [sent-214, score-0.157]
</p><p>58 Based on our assessment of evaluation 580  Figure 2: Performance of the different systems on WSJ, using three different measures [|C| :45, |T| :45]  vbsyrhclomftaewp knre14u0nhmt irs. [sent-217, score-0.209]
</p><p>59 v measures above, we report VM scores as the most reliable measure across different systems and cluster set sizes; to facilitate comparisons with previous papers, we also report many-to-one and one-to-one accuracy. [sent-221, score-0.424]
</p><p>60 Even the oldest and perhaps simplest method (brown) outperforms the two BHMMs and posterior regularization on all measures. [sent-226, score-0.155]
</p><p>61 The cw system returns a total of 568 clusters on this data set, so the many-to-one and one-to-one measures are not strictly comparable to the other systems; on VM this system achieves middling performance. [sent-234, score-0.53]
</p><p>62 We note that the two best-performing systems, clark and feat, are also the only two to use morphological information. [sent-235, score-0.243]
</p><p>63 Since the clustering algorithms used by brown and clark are quite similar, the difference in performance between the two can probably be attributed to the extra information provided by the morphology. [sent-236, score-0.407]
</p><p>64 2 Results on other corpora We now examine whether either the relative or absolute performance of the different systems holds up when tested on a variety of different languages. [sent-239, score-0.168]
</p><p>65 For the WSJ corpora we experimented with two standardly used tagsets: the orig-  inal PTB 45-tag gold standard and a coarser set of 17 tags previously used by several researchers working on unsupervised POS tagging (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007). [sent-242, score-0.393]
</p><p>66 , controlling as much as possible for corpus size and number of gold standard tags), we see that despite being developed on WSJ, the systems actually perform better on Multext-East. [sent-248, score-0.265]
</p><p>67 6We tried to make the meanings of the tags as similar as possible between the two corpora; we had to create 13 rather than 14 WSJ tags for this reason. [sent-257, score-0.154]
</p><p>68 , between different types of punctuation) are collapsed in the gold standard. [sent-265, score-0.151]
</p><p>69 One might expect that the two systems with morphological features (clark and feat) would show less difference between English and some of the other languages (all of which have complex morphology) than the other systems. [sent-268, score-0.171]
</p><p>70 However, although clark and feat (along with Brown) are the best performing systems overall, they don’t show any particular  benefit for the morphologically complex languages. [sent-269, score-0.525]
</p><p>71 8 One difference between the Multext-East results and the WSJ results is that on Multext-East, clark clearly outperforms all the other systems. [sent-270, score-0.184]
</p><p>72 This is true for both the English and non-English corpora, despite the similar performance of clark and feat on (English) WSJ. [sent-271, score-0.445]
</p><p>73 This suggests that feat benefits more from the larger corpus size of WSJ. [sent-272, score-0.261]
</p><p>74 For the other languages clark may be benefiting from somewhat more general morphological features; feat currently contains suffix features but no prefix features (although these could be added). [sent-273, score-0.536]
</p><p>75 Overall, our experiments on multiple languages support our earlier claim that many of the newer POS induction systems are not as successful as the older methods. [sent-274, score-0.492]
</p><p>76 Moreover, these experiments underscore the importance of testing unsupervised systems on multiple languages and domains, since both the absolute and relative performance of systems may change on different data sets. [sent-275, score-0.269]
</p><p>77 5  Learning from induced prototypes  We now introduce a final novel method of evaluating POS induction systems and potentially improving their performance as well. [sent-277, score-0.762]
</p><p>78 This model is unsupervised, but requires as input a handful of prototypes (canonical examples) for each word class. [sent-282, score-0.435]
</p><p>79 Using the most frequent words in each gold standard class as prototypes, the authors report 80. [sent-284, score-0.149]
</p><p>80 5% accuracy (both many-to-one and one-to-one) on WSJ, considerably higher than any of the induction systems seen here. [sent-285, score-0.247]
</p><p>81 This raises two questions: If we wish to induce prototypes without a tagged corpus or language-specific knowledge,  which induction system will provide the best prototypes (i. [sent-286, score-1.116]
</p><p>82 And, can we use the induced prototypes as input to the prototype-driven model (h&k;) to achieve better performance than the system the prototypes were extracted from? [sent-289, score-0.956]
</p><p>83 For each cluster ci ∈ C, we retain as candidate prototypes the words∈ ∈w Cho,se w frequency si cna ci iisat least 90% as high as the word with the highest frequency (in ci). [sent-291, score-0.679]

</p><p>86 Results in Table 3 show that the brown system produces the best prototypes. [sent-304, score-0.199]
</p><p>87 Although not as good as using prototypes from the gold standard (h&k;),  duction system, with prototypes extracted from each of the existing systems [|C| :45,|T| :45]. [sent-305, score-1.099]
</p><p>88 In fact, the brown+proto scores are, to our knowledge, the best reported results for an unsupervised POS induction system on WSJ. [sent-313, score-0.336]
</p><p>89 We see that brown again yields the best prototypes, and again yields improvements when used as brown+proto (although the improvements are not as large as those on WSJ). [sent-315, score-0.152]
</p><p>90 Interestingly, clark+proto actually performs worse than clark on the multilingual data, showing that although induced prototypes can in principle improve the performance of a system, not all systems will benefit in all situations. [sent-316, score-0.813]
</p><p>91 This suggests a need for additional investigation to determine what properties of an existing 583 induction system allow it to produce useful prototypes with the current method and/or to develop a specialized system specifically targeted towards inducing useful prototypes. [sent-317, score-0.696]
</p><p>92 6  Conclusion  In this paper, we have attempted to provide a more comprehensive review and comparison of evaluation measures and systems for POS induction than has been done before. [sent-318, score-0.376]
</p><p>93 We pointed out that most of the commonly used evaluation measures are sensitive to the number of induced clusters, and suggested that  V-measure (which is less sensitive) should be used as an alternative or in conjunction with the standard measures. [sent-319, score-0.204]
</p><p>94 With regard to the systems themselves, we found that many of the newer approaches actually perform worse than older methods that are both simpler and faster. [sent-320, score-0.329]
</p><p>95 The newer systems have introduced potentially important machine learning tools, but are not necessarily better suited to the POS induction task specifically. [sent-321, score-0.388]
</p><p>96 Since portability is a distinguishing feature for unsupervised models, we have stressed the importance of testing the systems on corpora that were not used in their development, and especially on different languages. [sent-322, score-0.199]
</p><p>97 Finally, we introduced the idea of evaluating induction systems based on their ability to produce useful cluster prototypes. [sent-324, score-0.41]
</p><p>98 , 1992) yielded the best prototypes, and that using these prototypes gave state-of-the-art performance on WSJ, as well as improvements on nearly all of the non-English corpora. [sent-326, score-0.435]
</p><p>99 These promising results suggest a new direction for future research: improving POS induction by developing methods targeted towards extracting better  prototypes, rather than focusing on improving clustering of the entire data set. [sent-327, score-0.238]

<p>Author: Christos Christodoulopoulos ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) induction is one of the most popular tasks in research on unsupervised NLP. Many different methods have been proposed, yet comparisons are difficult to make since there is little consensus on evaluation framework, and many papers evaluate against only one or two competitor systems. Here we evaluate seven different POS induction systems spanning nearly 20 years of work, using a variety of measures. We show that some of the oldest (and simplest) systems stand up surprisingly well against more recent approaches. Since most of these systems were developed and tested using data from the WSJ corpus, we compare their generalization abil- ities by testing on both WSJ and the multilingual Multext-East corpus. Finally, we introduce the idea of evaluating systems based on their ability to produce cluster prototypes that are useful as input to a prototype-driven learner. In most cases, the prototype-driven learner outperforms the unsupervised system used to initialize it, yielding state-of-the-art results on WSJ and improvements on nonEnglish corpora.</p><p>2 0.18958651 <a title="111-tfidf-2" href="./emnlp-2010-Simple_Type-Level_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging.html">97 emnlp-2010-Simple Type-Level Unsupervised POS Tagging</a></p>

<p>Author: Lei Shi ; Rada Mihalcea ; Mingjun Tian</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a method that automatically builds text classifiers in a new language by training on already labeled data in another language. Our method transfers the classification knowledge across languages by translating the model features and by using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm that naturally takes into account the ambiguity associated with the translation of a word. We further exploit the readily available unlabeled data in the target language via semisupervised learning, and adapt the translated model to better fit the data distribution of the target language.</p><p>2 0.99591184 <a title="111-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2010-Practical_Linguistic_Steganography_Using_Contextual_Synonym_Substitution_and_Vertex_Colour_Coding.html">91 emnlp-2010-Practical Linguistic Steganography Using Contextual Synonym Substitution and Vertex Colour Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Ching-Yun Chang ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: Linguistic Steganography is concerned with hiding information in natural language text. One of the major transformations used in Linguistic Steganography is synonym substitution. However, few existing studies have studied the practical application of this approach. In this paper we propose two improvements to the use of synonym substitution for encoding hidden bits of information. First, we use the Web 1T Google n-gram corpus for checking the applicability of a synonym in context, and we evaluate this method using data from the SemEval lexical substitution task. Second, we address the problem that arises from words with more than one sense, which creates a potential ambiguity in terms of which bits are encoded by a particular word. We develop a novel method in which words are the vertices in a graph, synonyms are linked by edges, and the bits assigned to a word are determined by a vertex colouring algorithm. This method ensures that each word encodes a unique sequence of bits, without cutting out large number of synonyms, and thus maintaining a reasonable embedding capacity.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.99305922 <a title="111-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Two_Decades_of_Unsupervised_POS_Induction%3A_How_Far_Have_We_Come%3F.html">111 emnlp-2010-Two Decades of Unsupervised POS Induction: How Far Have We Come?</a></p>

<p>Author: Xin Zhao ; Jing Jiang ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Discovering and summarizing opinions from online reviews is an important and challenging task. A commonly-adopted framework generates structured review summaries with aspects and opinions. Recently topic models have been used to identify meaningful review aspects, but existing topic models do not identify aspect-specific opinion words. In this paper, we propose a MaxEnt-LDA hybrid model to jointly discover both aspects and aspect-specific opinion words. We show that with a relatively small amount of training data, our model can effectively identify aspect and opinion words simultaneously. We also demonstrate the domain adaptability of our model.</p><p>5 0.98974204 <a title="111-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Probabilistic_Morphological_Analyzer_for_Syriac.html">10 emnlp-2010-A Probabilistic Morphological Analyzer for Syriac</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter McClanahan ; George Busby ; Robbie Haertel ; Kristian Heal ; Deryle Lonsdale ; Kevin Seppi ; Eric Ringger</p><p>Abstract: We define a probabilistic morphological analyzer using a data-driven approach for Syriac in order to facilitate the creation of an annotated corpus. Syriac is an under-resourced Semitic language for which there are no available language tools such as morphological analyzers. We introduce novel probabilistic models for segmentation, dictionary linkage, and morphological tagging and connect them in a pipeline to create a probabilistic morphological analyzer requiring only labeled data. We explore the performance of models with varying amounts of training data and find that with about 34,500 labeled tokens, we can outperform a reasonable baseline trained on over 99,000 tokens and achieve an accuracy of just over 80%. When trained on all available training data, our joint model achieves 86.47% accuracy, a 29.7% reduction in error rate over the baseline.</p><p>6 0.92133898 <a title="111-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-The_Necessity_of_Combining_Adaptation_Methods.html">104 emnlp-2010-The Necessity of Combining Adaptation Methods</a></p>

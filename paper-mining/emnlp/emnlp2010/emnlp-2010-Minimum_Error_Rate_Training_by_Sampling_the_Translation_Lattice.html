<p>Author: Sankaranarayanan Ananthakrishnan ; Rohit Prasad ; David Stallard ; Prem Natarajan</p><p>Abstract: Production of parallel training corpora for the development of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems for resource-poor languages usually requires extensive manual effort. Active sample selection aims to reduce the labor, time, and expense incurred in producing such resources, attaining a given performance benchmark with the smallest possible training corpus by choosing informative, nonredundant source sentences from an available candidate pool for manual translation. We present a novel, discriminative sample selection strategy that preferentially selects batches of candidate sentences with constructs that lead to erroneous translations on a held-out development set. The proposed strategy supports a built-in diversity mechanism that reduces redundancy in the selected batches.

Our method transfers the classification knowledge across languages by translating the model features and by using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm that naturally takes into account the ambiguity associated with the translation of a word. We further exploit the readily available unlabeled data in the target language via semisupervised learning, and adapt the translated model to better fit the data distribution of the target language.</p><p>4 0.27918747 <a title="78-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Example-Based_Paraphrasing_for_Improved_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">47 emnlp-2010-Example-Based Paraphrasing for Improved Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

Bederson</p><p>Abstract: Targeted paraphrasing is a new approach to the problem of obtaining cost-effective, reasonable quality translation that makes use of simple and inexpensive human computations by monolingual speakers in combination with machine translation. The key insight behind the process is that it is possible to spot likely translation errors with only monolingual knowledge of the target language, and it is possible to generate alternative ways to say the same thing (i.e. paraphrases) with only monolingual knowledge of the source language. Evaluations demonstrate that this approach can yield substantial improvements in translation quality.</p><p>6 0.24815993 <a title="78-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Facilitating_Translation_Using_Source_Language_Paraphrase_Lattices.html">50 emnlp-2010-Facilitating Translation Using Source Language Paraphrase Lattices</a></p>

<p>Author: Guillaume Wisniewski ; Alexandre Allauzen ; Francois Yvon</p><p>Abstract: Extant Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems are very complex softwares, which embed multiple layers of heuristics and embark very large numbers of numerical parameters. As a result, it is difficult to analyze output translations and there is a real need for tools that could help developers to better understand the various causes of errors. In this study, we make a step in that direction and present an attempt to evaluate the quality of the phrase-based translation model. In order to identify those translation errors that stem from deficiencies in the phrase table (PT), we propose to compute the oracle BLEU-4 score, that is the best score that a system based on this PT can achieve on a reference corpus. By casting the computation of the oracle BLEU-1 as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, we show that it is possible to efficiently compute accurate lower-bounds of this score, and report measures performed on several standard benchmarks. Various other applications of these oracle decoding techniques are also reported and discussed. 1 Phrase-Based Machine Translation 1.1 Principle A Phrase-Based Translation System (PBTS) consists of a ruleset and a scoring function (Lopez, 2009). The ruleset, represented in the phrase table, is a set of phrase1pairs {(f, e) }, each pair expressing that the source phrase f can ,bee) r}e,w earicthten p (atirra enxslparteedss)i inngto t a target phrase e. Trarsaens flation hypotheses are generated by iteratively rewriting portions of the source sentence as prescribed by the ruleset, until each source word has been consumed by exactly one rule. The order of target words in an hypothesis is uniquely determined by the order in which the rewrite operation are performed. The search space ofthe translation model corresponds to the set of all possible sequences of 1Following the usage in statistical machine translation literature, use “phrase” to denote a subsequence of consecutive words. we 933 rules applications. The scoring function aims to rank all possible translation hypotheses in such a way that the best one has the highest score. A PBTS is learned from a parallel corpus in two independent steps. In a first step, the corpus is aligned at the word level, by using alignment tools such as Gi z a++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and some symmetrisation heuristics; phrases are then extracted by other heuristics (Koehn et al., 2003) and assigned numerical weights. In the second step, the parameters of the scoring function are estimated, typically through Minimum Error Rate training (Och, 2003). Translating a sentence amounts to finding the best scoring translation hypothesis in the search space. Because of the combinatorial nature of this problem, translation has to rely on heuristic search techniques such as greedy hill-climbing (Germann, 2003) or variants of best-first search like multi-stack decoding (Koehn, 2004). Moreover, to reduce the overall complexity of decoding, the search space is typically pruned using simple heuristics. For instance, the state-of-the-art phrase-based decoder Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) considers only a restricted number of translations for each source sequence2 and enforces a distortion limit3 over which phrases can be reordered. As a consequence, the best translation hypothesis returned by the decoder is not always the one with the highest score. 1.2 Typology of PBTS Errors Analyzing the errors of a SMT system is not an easy task, because of the number of models that are combined, the size of these models, and the high complexity of the various decision making processes. For a SMT system, three different kinds of errors can be distinguished (Germann et al., 2004; Auli et al., 2009): search errors, induction errors and model errors. The former corresponds to cases where the hypothesis with the best score is missed by the search procedure, either because of the use of an ap2the 3the option of Moses, defaulting to 20. dl option of Moses, whose default value is 7. tt l ProceMedITin,g Ms oasfs thaceh 2u0se1t0ts C,o UnSfAer,e n9c-e11 on O Ectmobpeir ic 2a0l1 M0.e ?tc ho2d0s10 in A Nsastouciraatlio Lnan fogru Cagoem Ppruotcaetisosninagl, L pinaggeusis 9t3ic3s–943, proximate search method or because of the restrictions of the search space. Induction errors correspond to cases where, given the model, the search space does not contain the reference. Finally, model errors correspond to cases where the hypothesis with the highest score is not the best translation according to the evaluation metric. Model errors encompass several types oferrors that occur during learning (Bottou and Bousquet, 2008)4. Approximation errors are errors caused by the use of a restricted and oversimplistic class of functions (here, finitestate transducers to model the generation of hypotheses and a linear scoring function to discriminate them) to model the translation process. Estimation errors correspond to the use of sub-optimal values for both the phrase pairs weights and the parameters of the scoring function. The reasons behind these errors are twofold: first, training only considers a finite sample of data; second, it relies on error prone alignments. As a result, some “good” phrases are extracted with a small weight, or, in the limit, are not extracted at all; and conversely that some “poor” phrases are inserted into the phrase table, sometimes with a really optimistic score. Sorting out and assessing the impact of these various causes of errors is of primary interest for SMT system developers: for lack of such diagnoses, it is difficult to figure out which components of the system require the most urgent attention. Diagnoses are however, given the tight intertwining among the various component of a system, very difficult to obtain: most evaluations are limited to the computation of global scores and usually do not imply any kind of failure analysis. 1.3 Contribution and organization To systematically assess the impact of the multiple heuristic decisions made during training and decoding, we propose, following (Dreyer et al., 2007; Auli et al., 2009), to work out oracle scores, that is to evaluate the best achievable performances of a PBTS. We aim at both studying the expressive power of PBTS and at providing tools for identifying and quantifying causes of failure. Under standard metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), oracle scores are difficult (if not impossible) to compute, but, by casting the computation of the oracle unigram recall and precision as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, we show that it is possible to efficiently compute accurate lower-bounds of the oracle BLEU-4 scores and report measurements performed on several standard benchmarks. The main contributions of this paper are twofold. We first introduce an ILP program able to efficiently find the best hypothesis a PBTS can achieve. This program can be easily extended to test various improvements to 4We omit here optimization errors. 934 phrase-base systems or to evaluate the impact of different parameter settings. Second, we present a number of complementary results illustrating the usage of our oracle decoder for identifying and analyzing PBTS errors. Our experimental results confirm the main conclusions of (Turchi et al., 2008), showing that extant PBTs have the potential to generate hypotheses having very high BLEU4 score and that their main bottleneck is their scoring function. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we introduce and formalize the oracle decoding problem, and present a series of ILP problems of increasing complexity designed so as to deliver accurate lowerbounds of oracle score. This section closes with various extensions allowing to model supplementary constraints, most notably reordering constraints (Section 2.5). Our experiments are reported in Section 3, where we first introduce the training and test corpora, along with a description of our system building pipeline (Section 3. 1). We then discuss the baseline oracle BLEU scores (Section 3.2), analyze the non-reachable parts of the reference translations, and comment several complementary results which allow to identify causes of failures. Section 4 discuss our approach and findings with respect to the existing literature on error analysis and oracle decoding. We conclude and discuss further prospects in Section 5. 2 Oracle Decoder 2.1 The Oracle Decoding Problem Definition To get some insights on the errors of phrasebased systems and better understand their limits, we propose to consider the oracle decoding problem defined as follows: given a source sentence, its reference translation5 and a phrase table, what is the “best” translation hypothesis a system can generate? As usual, the quality of an hypothesis is evaluated by the similarity between the reference and the hypothesis. Note that in the oracle decoding problem, we are only assessing the ability of PBT systems to generate good candidate translations, irrespective of their ability to score them properly. We believe that studying this problem is interesting for various reasons. First, as described in Section 3.4, comparing the best hypothesis a system could have generated and the hypothesis it actually generates allows us to carry on both quantitative and qualitative failure analysis. The oracle decoding problem can also be used to assess the expressive power of phrase-based systems (Auli et al., 2009). Other applications include computing acceptable pseudo-references for discriminative training (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Liang et al., 2006; Arun and 5The oracle decoding problem can be extended to the case of multiple references. For the sake of simplicity, we only describe the case of a single reference. Koehn, 2007) or combining machine translation systems in a multi-source setting (Li and Khudanpur, 2009). We have also used oracle decoding to identify erroneous or difficult to translate references (Section 3.3). Evaluation Measure To fully define the oracle decoding problem, a measure of the similarity between a translation hypothesis and its reference translation has to be chosen. The most obvious choice is the BLEU-4 score (Papineni et al., 2002) used in most machine translation evaluations. However, using this metric in the oracle decoding problem raises several issues. First, BLEU-4 is a metric defined at the corpus level and is hard to interpret at the sentence level. More importantly, BLEU-4 is not decomposable6: as it relies on 4-grams statistics, the contribution of each phrase pair to the global score depends on the translation of the previous and following phrases and can not be evaluated in isolation. Because of its nondecomposability, maximizing BLEU-4 is hard; in particular, the phrase-level decomposability of the evaluation × metric is necessary in our approach. To circumvent this difficulty, we propose to evaluate the similarity between a translation hypothesis and a reference by the number of their common words. This amounts to evaluating translation quality in terms of unigram precision and recall, which are highly correlated with human judgements (Lavie et al., ). This measure is closely related to the BLEU-1 evaluation metric and the Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) metric (when it is evaluated without considering near-matches and the distortion penalty). We also believe that hypotheses that maximize the unigram precision and recall at the sentence level yield corpus level BLEU-4 scores close the maximal achievable. Indeed, in the setting we will introduce in the next section, BLEU-1 and BLEU-4 are highly correlated: as all correct words of the hypothesis will be compelled to be at their correct position, any hypothesis with a high 1-gram precision is also bound to have a high 2-gram precision, etc. 2.2 Formalizing the Oracle Decoding Problem The oracle decoding problem has already been considered in the case of word-based models, in which all translation units are bound to contain only one word. The problem can then be solved by a bipartite graph matching algorithm (Leusch et al., 2008): given a n m binary matarligxo describing possible t 2r0an08sl)a:ti goinv elinn aks n b×emtw beeinna source words and target words7, this algorithm finds the subset of links maximizing the number of words of the reference that have been translated, while ensuring that each word 6Neither at the sentence (Chiang et al., 2008), nor at the phrase level. 7The (i, j) entry of the matrix is 1if the ith word of the source can be translated by the jth word of the reference, 0 otherwise. 935 is translated only once. Generalizing this approach to phrase-based systems amounts to solving the following problem: given a set of possible translation links between potential phrases of the source and of the target, find the subset of links so that the unigram precision and recall are the highest possible. The corresponding oracle hypothesis can then be easily generated by selecting the target phrases that are aligned with one source phrase, disregarding the others. In addition, to mimic the way OOVs are usually handled, we match identical OOV tokens appearing both in the source and target sentences. In this approach, the unigram precision is always one (every word generated in the oracle hypothesis matches exactly one word in the reference). As a consequence, to find the oracle hypothesis, we just have to maximize the recall, that is the number of words appearing both in the hypothesis and in the reference. Considering phrases instead of isolated words has a major impact on the computational complexity: in this new setting, the optimal segmentations in phrases of both the source and of the target have to be worked out in addition to links selection. Moreover, constraints have to be taken into account so as to enforce a proper segmentation of the source and target sentences. These constraints make it impossible to use the approach of (Leusch et al., 2008) and concur in making the oracle decoding problem for phrase-based models more complex than it is for word-based models: it can be proven, using arguments borrowed from (De Nero and Klein, 2008), that this problem is NP-hard even for the simple unigram precision measure. 2.3 An Integer Program for Oracle Decoding To solve the combinatorial problem introduced in the previous section, we propose to cast it into an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, for which many generic solvers exist. ILP has already been used in SMT to find the optimal translation for word-based (Germann et al., 2001) and to study the complexity of learning phrase alignments (De Nero and Klein, 2008) models. Following the latter reference, we introduce the following variables: fi,j (resp. ek,l) is a binary indicator variable that is true when the phrase contains all spans from betweenword position i to j (resp. k to l) of the source (resp. target) sentence. We also introduce a binary variable, denoted ai,j,k,l, to describe a possible link between source phrase fi,j and target phrase ek,l. These variables are built from the entries of the phrase table according to selection strategies introduced in Section 2.4. In the following, index variables are so that: 0 ≤ i< j ≤ n, in the source sentence and 0 ≤ k < l ≤ m, in the target sentence, where n (resp. m) is the length of the source (resp. target) sentence. Solving the oracle decoding problem then amounts to optimizing the following objective function: mi,j,akx,li,Xj,k,lai,j,k,l· (l − k), (1) under the constraints: X ∀x ∈ J1,mK : ek,l ≤ 1 (2) = (3) 1∀,kn,lK : Xai,j,k,l = fk,l (4) ∀i,j : Xai,j,k,l (5) k,l s.tX. Xk≤x≤l ∀∀xy ∈∈ J11,,mnKK : X i,j s.tX. Xi≤y≤j fi,j 1 Xi,j = ei,j Xk,l The objective function (1) corresponds to the number of target words that are generated. The first set of constraints (2) ensures that each word in the reference e ap- pears in no more than one phrase. Maximizing the objective under these constraints amounts to maximizing the unigram recall. The second set of constraints (3) ensures that each word in the source f is translated exactly once, which guarantees that the search space of the ILP problem is the same as the search space of a phrase-based system. Constraints (4) bind the fk,l and ai,j,k,l variables, ensuring that whenever a link ai,j,k,l is active, the corresponding phrase fk,l is also active. Constraints (5) play a similar role for the reference. The Relaxed Problem Even though it accurately models the search space of a phrase-based decoder, this programs is not really useful as is: due to out-ofvocabulary words or missing entries in the phrase table, the constraint that all source words should be translated yields infeasible problems8. We propose to relax this problem and allow some source words to remain untranslated. This is done by replacing constraints (3) by: ∀y ∈ J1,nK : X i,j s.tX. Xi≤y≤j fi,j ≤ 1 To better ref∀lyec ∈t th J1e, bneKh :avior of phrase-based decoders, which attempt to translate all source words, we also need to modify the objective function as follows: X i,Xj,k,l ai,j,k,l · (l − k) +Xfi,j · (j − i) Xi,j (6) The second term in this new objective ensures that optimal solutions translate as many source words as possible. 8An ILP problem is said to be infeasible when tion violates at least one constraint. every possible solu- 936 The Relaxed-Distortion Problem A last caveat with the Relaxed optimization program is caused by frequently occurring source tokens, such as function words or punctuation signs, which can often align with more than one target word. For lack of taking distortion information into account in our objective function, all these alignments are deemed equivalent, even if some of them are clearly more satisfactory than others. This situation is illustrated on Figure 1. le chat et the cat and le the chien dog Figure 1: Equivalent alignments between “le” and “the”. The dashed lines corresponds to a less interpretable solution. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a last change to the objective function: X i,Xj,k,l ai,j,k,l · (l − k) +Xfi,j · (j − i) X ai,j,k,l|k − i| Xi,j −α (7) i Xk ,l X,j, Compared to the objective function of the relaxed problem (6), we introduce here a supplementary penalty factor which favors monotonous alignments. For each phrase pair, the higher the difference between source and target positions, the higher this penalty. If α is small enough, this extra term allows us to select, among all the optimal alignments of the re l axed problem, the one with the lowest distortion. In our experiments, we set α to min {n, m} to ensure that the penalty factor is always smminall{enr, ,tmha}n tthoe e rneswuarred t fhoart aligning atwltyo single iwso ardlwsa. 2.4 Selecting Indicator Variables In the approach introduced in the previous sections, the oracle decoding problem is solved by selecting, among a set of possible translation links, the ones that yield the solution with the highest unigram recall. We propose two strategies to build this set of possible translation links. In the first one, denoted exact match, an indicator ai,j,k,l is created if there is an entry (f, e) so that f spans from word position ito j in the source and e from word position k to l in the target. In this strategy, the ILP program considers exactly the same ruleset as conventional phrase-based decoders. We also consider an alternative strategy, which could help us to identify errors made during the phrase extraction process. In this strategy, denoted inside match, an indicator ai,j,k,l is created when the following three criteria are met: i) f spans from position ito j of the source; ii) a substring of e, denoted e, spans from position k to l of the reference; iii) (f, e¯) is not an entry of the phrase table. The resulting set of indicator variables thus contains, at least, all the variables used in the exact match strategy. In addition, we license here the use of phrases containing words that do not occur in the reference. In fact, using such solutions can yield higher BLEU scores when the reward for additional correct matches exceeds the cost incurred by wrong predictions. These cases are symptoms of situations where the extraction heuristic failed to extract potentially useful subphrases. 2.5 Oracle Decoding with Reordering Constraints The ILP problem introduced in the previous section can be extended in several ways to describe and test various improvements to phrase-based systems or to evaluate the impact of different parameter settings. This flexibility mainly stems from the possibility offered by our framework to express arbitrary constraints over variables. In this section, we illustrate these possibilities by describing how reordering constraints can easily be considered. As a first example, the Moses decoder uses a distortion limit to constrain the set of possible reorderings. This constraint “enforces (...) that the last word of a phrase chosen for translation cannot be more than d9 words from the leftmost untranslated word in the source” (Lopez, 2009) and is expressed as: ∀aijkl , ai0j0k0l0 s.t. k > k0, aijkl · ai0j0k0l0 · |j − i0 + 1| ≤ d, The maximum distortion limit strategy (Lopez, 2009) is also easily expressed and take the following form (assuming this constraint is parameterized by d): ∀l < m − 1, ai,j,k,l·ai0,j0,l+1,l0 · |i0 − j − 1| 71is%t e6hs.a distortion greater that Moses default distortion limit. alignment decisions enabled by the use of larger training corpora and phrase table. To evaluate the impact ofthe second heuristic, we computed the number of phrases discarded by Moses (be- cause of the default ttl limit) but used in the oracle hypotheses. In the English to French NEWSCO setting, they account for 34.11% of the total number of phrases used in the oracle hypotheses. When the oracle decoder is constrained to use the same phrase table as Moses, its BLEU-4 score drops to 42.78. This shows that filtering the phrase table prior to decoding discards many useful phrase pairs and is seriously limiting the best achievable performance, a conclusion shared with (Auli et al., 2009). Search Errors Search errors can be identified by comparing the score of the best hypothesis found by Moses and the score of the oracle hypothesis. If the score of the oracle hypothesis is higher, then there has been a search error; on the contrary, there has been an estimation error when the score of the oracle hypothesis is lower than the score of the best hypothesis found by Moses. 940 Based on the comparison of the score of Moses hypotheses and of oracle hypotheses for the English to French NEWSCO setting, our preliminary conclusion is that the number of search errors is quite limited: only about 5% of the hypotheses of our oracle decoder are actually getting a better score than Moses solutions. Again, this shows that the scoring function (model error) is one of the main bottleneck of current PBTS. Comparing these hypotheses is nonetheless quite revealing: while Moses mostly selects phrase pairs with high translation scores and generates monotonous alignments, our ILP decoder uses larger reorderings and less probable phrases to achieve better solutions: on average, the reordering score of oracle solutions is −5.74, compared to −76.78 fscoro rMeo osfe osr outputs. iGonivsen is −the5 weight assigned through MERT training to the distortion score, no wonder that these hypotheses are severely penalized. The Impact of Phrase Length The observed outputs do not only depend on decisions made during the search, but also on decisions made during training. One such decision is the specification of maximal length for the source and target phrases. In our framework, evaluating the impact of this decision is simple: it suffices to change the definition of indicator variables so as to consider only alignments between phrases of a given length. In the English-French NEWSCO setting, the most restrictive choice, when only alignments between single words are authorized, yields an oracle BLEU-4 of 48.68; however, authorizing phrases up to length 2 allows to achieve an oracle value of 66.57, very close to the score achieved when considering all extracted phrases (67.77). This is corroborated with a further analysis of our oracle alignments, which use phrases whose average source length is 1.21 words (respectively 1.31 for target words). If many studies have already acknowledged the predomi- nance of “small” phrases in actual translations, our oracle scores suggest that, for this language pair, increasing the phrase length limit beyond 2 or 3 might be a waste of computational resources. 4 Related Work To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few works that try to study the expressive power ofphrase-based machine translation systems or to provide tools for analyzing potential causes of failure. The approach described in (Auli et al., 2009) is very similar to ours: in this study, the authors propose to find and analyze the limits of machine translation systems by studying the reference reachability. A reference is reachable for a given system if it can be exactly generated by this system. Reference reachability is assessed using Moses in forced decoding mode: during search, all hypotheses that deviate from the reference are simply discarded. Even though the main goal of this study was to compare the search space of phrase-based and hierarchical systems, it also provides some insights on the impact of various search parameters in Moses, delivering conclusions that are consistent with our main results. As described in Section 1.2, these authors also propose a typology of the errors of a statistical translation systems, but do not attempt to provide methods for identifying them. The authors of (Turchi et al., 2008) study the learn- ing capabilities of Moses by extensively analyzing learning curves representing the translation performances as a function of the number of examples, and by corrupting the model parameters. Even though their focus is more on assessing the scoring function, they reach conclusions similar to ours: the current bottleneck of translation performances is not the representation power of the PBTS but rather in their scoring functions. Oracle decoding is useful to compute reachable pseudo-references in the context of discriminative training. This is the main motivation of (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006), where the authors compute high BLEU hypotheses by running a conventional decoder so as to maximize a per-sentence approximation of BLEU-4, under a simple (local) reordering model. Oracle decoding has also been used to assess the limitations induced by various reordering constraints in (Dreyer et al., 2007). To this end, the authors propose to use a beam-search based oracle decoder, which computes lower bounds of the best achievable BLEU-4 using dynamic programming techniques over finite-state (for so-called local and IBM constraints) or hierarchically structured (for ITG constraints) sets of hypotheses. Even 941 though the numbers reported in this study are not directly comparable with ours17, it seems that our decoder is not only conceptually much simpler, but also achieves much more optimistic lower-bounds of the oracle BLEU score. The approach described in (Li and Khudanpur, 2009) employs a similar technique, which is to guide a heuristic search in an hypergraph representing possible translation hypotheses with n-gram counts matches, which amounts to decoding with a n-gram model trained on the sole reference translation. Additional tricks are presented in this article to speed-up decoding. Computing oracle BLEU scores is also the subject of (Zens and Ney, 2005; Leusch et al., 2008), yet with a different emphasis. These studies are concerned with finding the best hypotheses in a word graph or in a consensus network, a problem that has various implications for multi-pass decoding and/or system combination techniques. The former reference describes an exponential approximate algorithm, while the latter proves the NPcompleteness of this problem and discuss various heuristic approaches. Our problem is somewhat more complex and using their techniques would require us to built word graphs containing all the translations induced by arbitrary segmentations and permutations of the source sentence. 5 Conclusions In this paper, we have presented a methodology for analyzing the errors of PBTS, based on the computation of an approximation of the BLEU-4 oracle score. We have shown that this approximation could be computed fairly accurately and efficiently using Integer Linear Programming techniques. Our main result is a confirmation of the fact that extant PBTS systems are expressive enough to achieve very high translation performance with respect to conventional quality measurements. The main efforts should therefore strive to improve on the way phrases and hypotheses are scored during training. This gives further support to attempts aimed at designing context-dependent scoring functions as in (Stroppa et al., 2007; Gimpel and Smith, 2008), or at attempts to perform discriminative training of feature-rich models. (Bangalore et al., 2007). We have shown that the examination of difficult-totranslate sentences was an effective way to detect errors or inconsistencies in the reference translations, making our approach a potential aid for controlling the quality or assessing the difficulty of test data. Our experiments have also highlighted the impact of various parameters. Various extensions of the baseline ILP program have been suggested and/or evaluated. In particular, the ILP formalism lends itself well to expressing various constraints that are typically used in conventional PBTS. In 17The best BLEU-4 oracle they achieve on Europarl German to English is approximately 48; but they considered a smaller version of the training corpus and the WMT’06 test set. our future work, we aim at using this ILP framework to systematically assess various search configurations. We plan to explore how replacing non-reachable references with high-score pseudo-references can improve discrim- inative training of PBTS. We are also concerned by determining how tight is our approximation of the BLEU4 score is: to this end, we intend to compute the best BLEU-4 score within the n-best solutions of the oracle decoding problem.

<p>Author: Samidh Chatterjee ; Nicola Cancedda</p><p>Abstract: Minimum Error Rate Training is the algorithm for log-linear model parameter training most used in state-of-the-art Statistical Machine Translation systems. In its original formulation, the algorithm uses N-best lists output by the decoder to grow the Translation Pool that shapes the surface on which the actual optimization is performed. Recent work has been done to extend the algorithm to use the entire translation lattice built by the decoder, instead of N-best lists. We propose here a third, intermediate way, consisting in growing the translation pool using samples randomly drawn from the translation lattice. We empirically measure a systematic im- provement in the BLEU scores compared to training using N-best lists, without suffering the increase in computational complexity associated with operating with the whole lattice.</p><p>2 0.77513295 <a title="78-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2010-Further_Meta-Evaluation_of_Broad-Coverage_Surface_Realization.html">52 emnlp-2010-Further Meta-Evaluation of Broad-Coverage Surface Realization</a></p>
<p>Author: Dominic Espinosa ; Rajakrishnan Rajkumar ; Michael White ; Shoshana Berleant</p><p>Abstract: We present the first evaluation of the utility of automatic evaluation metrics on surface realizations of Penn Treebank data. Using outputs of the OpenCCG and XLE realizers, along with ranked WordNet synonym substitutions, we collected a corpus of generated surface realizations. These outputs were then rated and post-edited by human annotators. We evaluated the realizations using seven automatic metrics, and analyzed correlations obtained between the human judgments and the automatic scores. In contrast to previous NLG meta-evaluations, we find that several of the metrics correlate moderately well with human judgments of both adequacy and fluency, with the TER family performing best overall. We also find that all of the metrics correctly predict more than half of the significant systemlevel differences, though none are correct in all cases. We conclude with a discussion ofthe implications for the utility of such metrics in evaluating generation in the presence of variation. A further result of our research is a corpus of post-edited realizations, which will be made available to the research community. 1 Introduction and Background In building surface-realization systems for natural language generation, there is a need for reliable automated metrics to evaluate the output. Unlike in parsing, where there is usually a single goldstandard parse for a sentence, in surface realization there are usually many grammatically-acceptable ways to express the same concept. This parallels the task of evaluating machine-translation (MT) systems: for a given segment in the source language, 564 there are usually several acceptable translations into the target language. As human evaluation of translation quality is time-consuming and expensive, a number of automated metrics have been developed to evaluate the quality of MT outputs. In this study, we investigate whether the metrics developed for MT evaluation tasks can be used to reliably evaluate the outputs of surface realizers, and which of these metrics are best suited to this task. A number of surface realizers have been developed using the Penn Treebank (PTB), and BLEU scores are often reported in the evaluations of these systems. But how useful is BLEU in this context? The original BLEU study (Papineni et al., 2001) scored MT outputs, which are of generally lower quality than grammar-based surface realizations. Furthermore, even for MT systems, the usefulness of BLEU has been called into question (Callison-Burch et al., 2006). BLEU is designed to work with multiple reference sentences, but in treebank realization, there is only a single reference sentence available for comparison. A few other studies have investigated the use of such metrics in evaluating the output of NLG systems, notably (Reiter and Belz, 2009) and (Stent et al., 2005). The former examined the performance of BLEU and ROUGE with computer-generated weather reports, finding a moderate correlation with human fluency judgments. The latter study applied several MT metrics to paraphrase data from Barzilay and Lee’s corpus-based system (Barzilay and Lee, 2003), and found moderate correlations with human adequacy judgments, but little correlation with fluency judgments. Cahill (2009) examined the performance of six MT metrics (including BLEU) in evaluating the output of a LFG-based surface realizer for ProceMedITin,g Ms oasfs thaceh 2u0se1t0ts C,o UnSfAer,e n9c-e1 on O Ectmobpeir ic 2a0l1 M0.e ?tc ho2d0s10 in A Nsastoucira tlio Lnan fogru Cagoem Ppruotcaetisosninagl, L pinag eusis 5t6ic4s–574, German, also finding only weak correlations with the human judgments. To study the usefulness of evaluation metrics such as BLEU on the output of grammar-based surface realizers used with the PTB, we assembled a corpus of surface realizations from three different realizers operating on Section 00 of the PTB. Two human judges evaluated the adequacy and fluency of each of the realizations with respect to the reference sentence. The realizations were then scored with a number of automated evaluation metrics developed for machine translation. In order to investigate the correlation of targeted metrics with human evaluations, and gather other acceptable realizations for future evaluations, the judges manually repaired each unacceptable realization during the rating task. In contrast to previous NLG meta-evaluations, we found that several of the metrics correlate moderately well with human judgments of both adequacy and fluency, with the TER family performing best. However, when looking at statistically significant system-level differences in human judgments, we found that some of the metrics get some of the rankings correct, but none get them all correct, with different metrics making different ranking errors. This suggests that multiple metrics should be routinely consulted when comparing realizer systems. Overall, our methodology is similar to that of previous MT meta-evaluations, in that we collected human judgments of system outputs, and compared these scores with those assigned by automatic metrics. A recent alternative approach to paraphrase evaluation is ParaMetric (Callison-Burch et al., 2008); however, it requires a corpus of annotated (aligned) paraphrases (which does not yet exist for PTB data), and is arguably focused more on paraphrase analysis than paraphrase generation. The plan of the paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses the preparation of the corpus of surface realizations. Section 3 describes the human evaluation task and the automated metrics applied. Sections 4 and 5 present and discuss the results of these evaluations. We conclude with some general observations about automatic evaluation of surface realizers, and some directions for further research. 565 2 Data Preparation We collected realizations of the sentences in Section 00 of the WSJ corpus from the following three sources: 1. OpenCCG, a CCG-based chart realizer (White, 2006) 2. The XLE Generator, a LFG-based system developed by Xerox PARC (Crouch et al., 2008) 3. WordNet synonym substitutions, to investigate how differences in lexical choice compare to grammar-based variation.1 Although all three systems used Section 00 of the PTB, they were applied with various parameters (e.g., language models, multiple-output versus single-output) and on different input structures. Accordingly, our study does not compare OpenCCG to XLE, or either of these to the WordNet system. 2.1 OpenCCG realizations OpenCCG is an open source parsing/realization library with multimodal extensions to CCG (Baldridge, 2002). The OpenCCG chart realizer takes logical forms as input and produces strings by combining signs for lexical items. Alternative realizations are scored using integrated n-gram and perceptron models. For robustness, fragments are greedily assembled when necessary. Realizations were generated from 1,895 gold standard logical forms, created by constrained parsing of development-section derivations. The following OpenCCG models (which differ essentially in the way the output is ranked) were used: 1. Baseline 1: Output ranked by a trigram word model 2. Baseline 2: Output ranked using three language models (3-gram words 3-gram words with named entity class replacement factored language model of words, POS tags and CCG supertags) + + 1Not strictly surface realizations, since they do not involve an abstract input specification, but for simplicity we refer to them as realizations throughout. 3. Baseline 3: Perceptron with syntax features and the three LMs mentioned above 4. Perceptron full-model: n-best realizations ranked using perceptron with syntax features and the three n-gram models, as well as discriminative n-grams The perceptron model was trained on sections 0221 of the CCGbank, while a grammar extracted from section 00-21 was used for realization. In addition, oracle supertags were inserted into the chart during realization. The purpose of such a non-blind testing strategy was to evaluate the quality of the output produced by the statistical ranking models in isolation, rather than focusing on grammar coverage, and avoid the problems associated with lexical smoothing, i.e. lexical categories in the development section not being present in the training section. To enrich the variation in the generated realizations, dative-alternation was enforced during realization by ensuring alternate lexical categories of the verb in question, as in the following example: (1) the executives gave [the chefs] [a standing ovation] (2) the executives gave [a standing ovation] [to the chefs] 2.2 XLE realizations The corpus of realizations generated by the XLE system contained 42,527 surface realizations of approximately 1,421 section 00 sentences (an average of 30 per sentence), initially unranked. The LFG f-structures used as input to the XLE generator were derived from automatic parses, as described in (Riezler et al., 2002). The realizations were first tokenized using Penn Treebank conventions, then ranked using perplexities calculated from the same trigram word model used with OpenCCG. For each sentence, the top 4 realizations were selected. The XLE generator provides an interesting point of comparison to OpenCCG as it uses a manuallydeveloped grammar with inputs that are less abstract but potentially noisier, as they are derived from automatic parses rather than gold-standard ones. 566 2.3 WordNet synonymizer To produce an additional source of variation, the nouns and verbs of the sentences in section 00 of the PTB were replaced with all of their WordNet synonyms. Verb forms were generated using verb stems, part-of-speech tags, and the morphg tool.2 These substituted outputs were then filtered using the n-gram data which Google Inc. has made available.3 Those without any 5-gram matches centered on the substituted word (or 3-gram matches, in the case of short sentences) were eliminated. 3 Evaluation From the data sources described in the previous sec- tion, a corpus of realizations to be evaluated by the human judges was constructed by randomly choosing 305 sentences from section 00, then selecting surface realizations of these sentences using the following algorithm: 1. Add OpenCCG’s best-scored realization. 2. Add other OpenCCG realizations until all four models are represented, to a maximum of 4. 3. Add up to 4 realizations from either the XLE system or the WordNet pool, chosen randomly. The intent was to give reasonable coverage of all realizer systems discussed in Section 2 without overloading the human judges. “System” here means any instantiation that emits surface realizations, including various configurations of OpenCCG (using different language models or ranking systems), and these can be multiple-output, such as an n-best list, or single-output (best-only, worst-only, etc.). Accordingly, more realizations were selected from the OpenCCG realizer because 5 different systems were being represented. Realizations were chosen randomly, rather than according to sentence types or other criteria, in order to produce a representative sample of the corpus. In total, 2,114 realizations were selected for evaluation. 2http : //www. informatics . sussex. ac .uk/ re search/ groups / nlp / carro l /morph .html l 3http : //www . ldc . upenn .edu/Catalog/docs/ LDC2 0 0 6T 13 / readme .txt 3.1 Human judgments Two human judges evaluated each surface realization on two criteria: adequacy, which represents the extent to which the output conveys all and only the meaning of the reference sentence; and fluency, the extent to which it is grammatically acceptable. The realizations were presented to the judges in sets containing a reference sentence and the 1-8 outputs selected for that sentence. To aid in the evaluation of adequacy, one sentence each of leading and trailing context were displayed. Judges used the guidelines given in Figure 1, based on the scales developed by the NIST Machine Translation Evaluation Workshop. In addition to rating each realization on the two five-point scales, each judge also repaired each output which he or she did not judge to be fully adequate and fluent. An example is shown in Figure 2. These repairs resulted in new reference sentences for a substantial number of sentences. These repaired realizations were later used to calculate targeted versions of the evaluation metrics, i.e., using the repaired sentence as the reference sentence. Although targeted metrics are not fully automatic, they are of interest because they allow the evaluation algorithm to focus on what is actually wrong with the input, rather than all textual differences. Notably, targeted TER (HTER) has been shown to be more consistent with human judgments than human annotators are with one another (Snover et al., 2006). 3.2 Automatic evaluation The realizations were also evaluated using seven automatic metrics: • IBM’s BLEU, which scores a hypothesis by counting n-gram matches with the reference sentence (Papineni et al., 2001), with smoothing as described in (Lin and Och, 2004) • • • • • • The NIST n-gram evaluation metric, similar to BLEU, but rewarding rarer n-gram matches, and using a different length penalty METEOR, which measures the harmonic mean of unigram precision and recall, with a higher weight for recall (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) 567 TER (Translation Edit Rate), a measure of the number of edits required to transform a hypothesis sentence into the reference sentence (Snover et al., 2006) TERP, an augmented version of TER which performs phrasal substitutions, stemming, and checks for synonyms, among other improvements (Snover et al., 2009) TERPA, an instantiation of TERP with edit weights optimized for correlation with adequacy in MT evaluations GTM (General Text Matcher), a generaliza- tion of the F-measure that rewards contiguous matching spans (Turian et al., 2003) Additionally, targeted versions of BLEU, METEOR, TER, and GTM were computed by using the human-repaired outputs as the reference set. The human repair was different from the reference sentence in 193 cases (about 9% of the total), and we expected this to result in better scores and correlations with the human judgments overall. 4 Results 4.1 Human judgments Table 1 summarizes the dataset, as well as the mean adequacy and fluency scores garnered from the human evaluation. Overall adequacy and fluency judgments were high (4.16, 3.63) for the realizer systems on average, and the best-rated realizer systems achieved mean fluency scores above 4. 4.2 Inter-annotator agreement Inter-annotator agreement was measured using the κ-coefficient, which is commonly used to measure the extent to which annotators agree in category P(1A−)P−(PE()E), judgment tasks. κ is defined as where P(A) is the observed agreement 1 b−etPw(eEe)n annotators and P(E) is the probability of agreement due to chance (Carletta, 1996). Chance agreement for this data is calculated by the method discussed in Carletta’s squib. However, in previous work in MT meta-evaluation, Callison-Burch et al. (2007), assume the less strict criterion of uniform chance agreement, i.e. for a five-point scale. They also 51 Score Adequacy Fluency 5All the meaning of the referencePerfectly grammatical 4 Most of the meaning Awkward or non-native; punctuation errors 3 Much of the meaning Agreement errors or minor syntactic problems 2 Meaning substantially different Major syntactic problems, such as missing words 1 Meaning completely different Completely ungrammatical Figure Ref.

The κ scores of0.60 for adequacy and 0.63 for fluency across the entire dataset represent “substantial” agreement, according to the guidelines discussed in (Landis and Koch, 1977), better than is typically reported for machine translation evaluation tasks; for example, Callison-Burch et al. (2007) reported “fair” agreement, with κ = 0.281 for fluency and κ = 0.307 for adequacy (relative). Assuming the uniform chance agreement that the previously cited work adopts, our inter-annotator agreements (both absolute and relative) are still higher. This is likely due to the generally high quality of the realizations evaluated, leading to easier judgments. 4.3 Correlation with automatic evaluation To determine how well the automatic evaluation methods described in Section 3 correlate with the human judgments, we averaged the human judgments for adequacy and fluency, respectively, for each of the rated realizations, and then computed both Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between these scores and each of the metrics. Spearman’s correlation makes fewer assumptions about the distribu- tion of the data, but may not reflect a linear rela568 tionship that is actually present. Both are frequently reported in the literature. Due to space constraints, we show only Spearman’s correlation, although the TER family scored slightly better on Pearson’s coefficient, relatively. The results for Spearman’s correlation are given in Table 3. Additionally, the average scores for adequacy and fluency were themselves averaged into a single score, following (Snover et al., 2009), and the Spearman’s correlation of each of the automatic metrics with these scores are given in Table 4. All reported correlations are significant at p < 0.001. 4.4 Bootstrap sampling of correlations For each of the sub-corpora shown in Table 1, we computed confidence intervals for the correlations between adequacy and fluency human scores with selected automatic metrics (BLEU, HBLEU, TER, TERP, and HTER) as described in (Koenh, 2004). We sampled each sub-corpus 1000 times with replace- ment, and calculated correlations between the rankings induced by the human scores and those induced by the metrics for each reference sentence. We then used these coefficients to estimate the confidence interval, after excluding the top 25 and bottom 25 coefficients, following (Lin and Och, 2004). The results of this for the BLEU metric are shown in Table 5. We determined which correlations lay within the 95% confidence interval of the best performing metric in each row of Table Table 3; these figures are italicized. 5 Discussion 5.1 Human judgments of systems The results for the four OpenCCG perceptron models mostly confirm those reported in (White and Rajkumar, 2009), with one exception: the B-3 model was below B-2, though the P-B (perceptron-best) model still scored highest. This may have been due to differences in the testing scenario. None of the differences in adequacy scores among the individual systems are significant, with the exception of the WordNet system. In this case, the lack of wordsense disambiguation for the substituted words results in a poor overall adequacy score (e.g., wage floor → wage story). Conversely, it scores highest ffoloro fluency, as substituting a noun or tve srcbo rwesith h a synonym does not usually introduce ungrammaticality. 5.2 Correlations of human judgments with MT metrics Of the non-human-targeted metrics evaluated, BLEU and TER/TERP demonstrate the highest correlations with the human judgments of fluency (r = 0.62, 0.64). The TER family of evaluation metrics have been observed to perform very well in MTevaluation tasks, and although the data evaluated here differs from typical MT data in some important ways, the correlation of TERP with the human judgments is substantial. In contrast with previous MT evaluations where TERP performs considerably better than TER, these scored close to equal on our data, possibly because TERP’s stem, synonym, and paraphrase matching are less useful when most of the variation is syntactic. The correlations with BLEU and METEOR are lower than those reported in (Callison-Burch et al., 2007); in that study, BLEU achieved adequacy and fluency correlations of 0.690 and 0.722, respectively, and METEOR achieved 0.701 and 0.719. The correlations for these metrics might be expected to be lower for our data, since overall quality is higher, making the metrics’ task more difficult as the outputs involve subtler differences between acceptable and unacceptable variation. The human-targeted metrics (represented by the prefixed H in the data tables) correlated even more strongly with the human judgments, compared to the non-targeted versions. HTER demonstrated the best 569 correlation with realizer fluency (r = 0.75). For several kinds of acceptable variation involving the rearrangement of constituents (such as dative shift), TERP gives a more reasonable score than BLEU, due to its ability to directly evaluate phrasal shifts. The following realization was rated 4.5 for fluency, and was more correctly ranked by TERP than BLEU: (3) Ref: The deal also gave Mitsui access to a high-tech medical product. (4) Realiz.: The deal also gave access to a high-tech medical product to Mitsui. For each reference sentence, we compared the ranking of its realizations induced from the human scores to the ranking induced from the TERP score, and counted the rank errors by the latter, informally categorizing them by error type (see Table 7). In the 50 sentences with the highest numbers of rank errors, 17 were affected by punctuation differences, typically involving variation in comma placement. Human fluency judgments of outputs with only punctuation problems were generally high, and many realizations with commas inserted or removed were rated fully fluent by the annotators. However, TERP penalizes such insertions or deletions. Agreement errors are another frequent source of ranking errors for TERP. The human judges tended to harshly penalize sentences with number-agreement or tense errors, whereas TERP applies only a single substitution penalty for each such error. We expect that with suitable optimization of edit weights to avoid over-penalizing punctuation shifts and underpenalizing agreement errors, TERP would exhibit an even stronger correlation with human fluency judgments. None of the evaluation metrics can distinguish an acceptable movement of a word or constituent from an unacceptable movement, with only one reference sentence. A substantial source of error for both TERP and BLEU is variation in adverbial placement, as shown in (7). Similar errors are seen with prepositional phrases and some commonly-occurring temporal adverbs, which typically admit a number of variations in placement. Another important example of acceptable variation which these metrics do not generally rank correctly is dative alternation: Ref. We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it. Realiz. Flu.

When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time , she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave students the answers. The correlations of each of the metrics with the human judgments of fluency for the realizer systems indicate at least a moderate relationship, in contrast with the results reported in (Stent et al., 2005) for paraphrase data, which found an inverse correlation for fluency, and (Cahill, 2009) for the output ofa surface realizer for German, which found only a weak correlation. However, the former study employed a corpus-based paraphrase generation system rather than grammar-driven surface realizers, and the resulting paraphrases exhibited much broader variation. In Cahill’s study, the outputs of the realizer were almost always grammatically correct, and the automated evaluation metrics were ranking markedness instead of grammatical acceptability. 5.3 System-level comparisons In order to investigate the efficacy of the metrics in ranking different realizer systems, or competing realizations from the same system generated using different ranking models, we considered seven different “systems” from the whole dataset of realizations. These consisted of five OpenCCG-based realizations (the best realization from three baseline models, and the best and the worst realization from the full perceptron model), and two XLE-based sys- tems (the best and the worst realization, after ranking the outputs of the XLE realizer with an n-gram model). The mean of the combined adequacy and 570 3 0.103 0.346 fluency scores of each of these seven systems was compared with that of every other system, resulting in 21 pairwise comparisons. Then Tukey’s HSD test was performed to determine the systems which differed significantly in terms of the average adequacy and fluency rating they received.4 The test revealed five pairwise comparisons where the scores were significantly different. Subsequently, for each of these systems, an overall system-level score for each of the MT metrics was calculated. For the five pairwise comparisons where the adequacy-fluency group means differed significantly, we checked whether the metric ranked the systems correctly. Table 8 shows the results of a pairwise comparison between the ranking induced by each evaluation metric, and the ranking induced by the human judgments. Five of the seven non- targeted metrics correctly rank more than half of the systems. NIST, METEOR, and GTM get the most comparisons right, but neither NIST nor GTM correctly rank the OpenCCG-baseline model 1 with respect to the XLE-best model. TER and TERP get two of the five comparisons correct, and they incorrectly rank two of the five OpenCCG model comparisons, as well as the comparison between the XLE-worst and OpenCCG-best systems. For the targeted metrics, HNIST is correct for all five comparisons, while neither HBLEU nor HMETEOR correctly rank all the OpenCCG models. On the other hand, HTER and HGTM incorrectly rank the XLE-best system versus OpenCCG-based models. In summary, some of the metrics get some of the rankings correct, but none of the non-targeted metrics get all of them correct. Moreover, different metrics make different ranking errors. This argues for 4This particular test was chosen since it corrects for multiple post-hoc analyses conducted on the same data-set. the use of multiple metrics in comparing realizer systems. 6 Conclusion Our study suggests that although the task of evaluating the output from realizer systems differs from the task of evaluating machine translations, the automatic metrics used to evaluate MT outputs deliver moderate correlations with combined human fluency and adequacy scores when used on surface realizations. We also found that the MT-evaluation metrics are useful in evaluating different versions of the same realizer system (e.g., the various OpenCCG realization ranking models), and finding cases where a system is performing poorly. As in MT-evaluation tasks, human-targeted metrics have the highest correlations with human judgments overall. These results suggest that the MT-evaluation metrics are useful for developing surface realizers. However, the correlations are lower than those reported for MT data, suggesting that they should be used with caution, especially for cross-system evaluation, where consulting multiple metrics may yield more reliable comparisons. In our study, the targeted version of TERP correlated most strongly with human judgments of fluency. In future work, the performance of the TER family of metrics on this data might be improved by opti- mizing the edit weights used in computing its scores, so as to avoid over-penalizing punctuation movements or under-penalizing agreement errors, both of which were significant sources of ranking errors. Multiple reference sentences may also help mitigate these problems, and the corpus of human-repaired realizations that has resulted from our study is a step in this direction, as it provides multiple references for some cases. We expect the corpus to also prove useful for feature engineering and error analysis in developing better realization models.5 Acknowledgements We thank Aoife Cahill and Tracy King for providing us with the output of the XLE generator.

<p>Author: Guillaume Wisniewski ; Alexandre Allauzen ; Francois Yvon</p><p>Abstract: Extant Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems are very complex softwares, which embed multiple layers of heuristics and embark very large numbers of numerical parameters. As a result, it is difficult to analyze output translations and there is a real need for tools that could help developers to better understand the various causes of errors. In this study, we make a step in that direction and present an attempt to evaluate the quality of the phrase-based translation model. In order to identify those translation errors that stem from deficiencies in the phrase table (PT), we propose to compute the oracle BLEU-4 score, that is the best score that a system based on this PT can achieve on a reference corpus. By casting the computation of the oracle BLEU-1 as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, we show that it is possible to efficiently compute accurate lower-bounds of this score, and report measures performed on several standard benchmarks. Various other applications of these oracle decoding techniques are also reported and discussed. 1 Phrase-Based Machine Translation 1.1 Principle A Phrase-Based Translation System (PBTS) consists of a ruleset and a scoring function (Lopez, 2009). The ruleset, represented in the phrase table, is a set of phrase1pairs {(f, e) }, each pair expressing that the source phrase f can ,bee) r}e,w earicthten p (atirra enxslparteedss)i inngto t a target phrase e. Trarsaens flation hypotheses are generated by iteratively rewriting portions of the source sentence as prescribed by the ruleset, until each source word has been consumed by exactly one rule. The order of target words in an hypothesis is uniquely determined by the order in which the rewrite operation are performed. The search space ofthe translation model corresponds to the set of all possible sequences of 1Following the usage in statistical machine translation literature, use “phrase” to denote a subsequence of consecutive words. we 933 rules applications. The scoring function aims to rank all possible translation hypotheses in such a way that the best one has the highest score. A PBTS is learned from a parallel corpus in two independent steps. In a first step, the corpus is aligned at the word level, by using alignment tools such as Gi z a++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and some symmetrisation heuristics; phrases are then extracted by other heuristics (Koehn et al., 2003) and assigned numerical weights. In the second step, the parameters of the scoring function are estimated, typically through Minimum Error Rate training (Och, 2003). Translating a sentence amounts to finding the best scoring translation hypothesis in the search space. Because of the combinatorial nature of this problem, translation has to rely on heuristic search techniques such as greedy hill-climbing (Germann, 2003) or variants of best-first search like multi-stack decoding (Koehn, 2004). Moreover, to reduce the overall complexity of decoding, the search space is typically pruned using simple heuristics. For instance, the state-of-the-art phrase-based decoder Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) considers only a restricted number of translations for each source sequence2 and enforces a distortion limit3 over which phrases can be reordered. As a consequence, the best translation hypothesis returned by the decoder is not always the one with the highest score. 1.2 Typology of PBTS Errors Analyzing the errors of a SMT system is not an easy task, because of the number of models that are combined, the size of these models, and the high complexity of the various decision making processes. For a SMT system, three different kinds of errors can be distinguished (Germann et al., 2004; Auli et al., 2009): search errors, induction errors and model errors. The former corresponds to cases where the hypothesis with the best score is missed by the search procedure, either because of the use of an ap2the 3the option of Moses, defaulting to 20. dl option of Moses, whose default value is 7. tt l ProceMedITin,g Ms oasfs thaceh 2u0se1t0ts C,o UnSfAer,e n9c-e11 on O Ectmobpeir ic 2a0l1 M0.e ?tc ho2d0s10 in A Nsastouciraatlio Lnan fogru Cagoem Ppruotcaetisosninagl, L pinaggeusis 9t3ic3s–943, proximate search method or because of the restrictions of the search space. Induction errors correspond to cases where, given the model, the search space does not contain the reference. Finally, model errors correspond to cases where the hypothesis with the highest score is not the best translation according to the evaluation metric. Model errors encompass several types oferrors that occur during learning (Bottou and Bousquet, 2008)4. Approximation errors are errors caused by the use of a restricted and oversimplistic class of functions (here, finitestate transducers to model the generation of hypotheses and a linear scoring function to discriminate them) to model the translation process. Estimation errors correspond to the use of sub-optimal values for both the phrase pairs weights and the parameters of the scoring function. The reasons behind these errors are twofold: first, training only considers a finite sample of data; second, it relies on error prone alignments. As a result, some “good” phrases are extracted with a small weight, or, in the limit, are not extracted at all; and conversely that some “poor” phrases are inserted into the phrase table, sometimes with a really optimistic score. Sorting out and assessing the impact of these various causes of errors is of primary interest for SMT system developers: for lack of such diagnoses, it is difficult to figure out which components of the system require the most urgent attention. Diagnoses are however, given the tight intertwining among the various component of a system, very difficult to obtain: most evaluations are limited to the computation of global scores and usually do not imply any kind of failure analysis. 1.3 Contribution and organization To systematically assess the impact of the multiple heuristic decisions made during training and decoding, we propose, following (Dreyer et al., 2007; Auli et al., 2009), to work out oracle scores, that is to evaluate the best achievable performances of a PBTS. We aim at both studying the expressive power of PBTS and at providing tools for identifying and quantifying causes of failure. Under standard metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), oracle scores are difficult (if not impossible) to compute, but, by casting the computation of the oracle unigram recall and precision as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, we show that it is possible to efficiently compute accurate lower-bounds of the oracle BLEU-4 scores and report measurements performed on several standard benchmarks. The main contributions of this paper are twofold. We first introduce an ILP program able to efficiently find the best hypothesis a PBTS can achieve. This program can be easily extended to test various improvements to 4We omit here optimization errors. 934 phrase-base systems or to evaluate the impact of different parameter settings. Second, we present a number of complementary results illustrating the usage of our oracle decoder for identifying and analyzing PBTS errors. Our experimental results confirm the main conclusions of (Turchi et al., 2008), showing that extant PBTs have the potential to generate hypotheses having very high BLEU4 score and that their main bottleneck is their scoring function. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we introduce and formalize the oracle decoding problem, and present a series of ILP problems of increasing complexity designed so as to deliver accurate lowerbounds of oracle score. This section closes with various extensions allowing to model supplementary constraints, most notably reordering constraints (Section 2.5). Our experiments are reported in Section 3, where we first introduce the training and test corpora, along with a description of our system building pipeline (Section 3. 1). We then discuss the baseline oracle BLEU scores (Section 3.2), analyze the non-reachable parts of the reference translations, and comment several complementary results which allow to identify causes of failures. Section 4 discuss our approach and findings with respect to the existing literature on error analysis and oracle decoding. We conclude and discuss further prospects in Section 5. 2 Oracle Decoder 2.1 The Oracle Decoding Problem Definition To get some insights on the errors of phrasebased systems and better understand their limits, we propose to consider the oracle decoding problem defined as follows: given a source sentence, its reference translation5 and a phrase table, what is the “best” translation hypothesis a system can generate? As usual, the quality of an hypothesis is evaluated by the similarity between the reference and the hypothesis. Note that in the oracle decoding problem, we are only assessing the ability of PBT systems to generate good candidate translations, irrespective of their ability to score them properly. We believe that studying this problem is interesting for various reasons. First, as described in Section 3.4, comparing the best hypothesis a system could have generated and the hypothesis it actually generates allows us to carry on both quantitative and qualitative failure analysis. The oracle decoding problem can also be used to assess the expressive power of phrase-based systems (Auli et al., 2009). Other applications include computing acceptable pseudo-references for discriminative training (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Liang et al., 2006; Arun and 5The oracle decoding problem can be extended to the case of multiple references. For the sake of simplicity, we only describe the case of a single reference. Koehn, 2007) or combining machine translation systems in a multi-source setting (Li and Khudanpur, 2009). We have also used oracle decoding to identify erroneous or difficult to translate references (Section 3.3). Evaluation Measure To fully define the oracle decoding problem, a measure of the similarity between a translation hypothesis and its reference translation has to be chosen. The most obvious choice is the BLEU-4 score (Papineni et al., 2002) used in most machine translation evaluations. However, using this metric in the oracle decoding problem raises several issues. First, BLEU-4 is a metric defined at the corpus level and is hard to interpret at the sentence level. More importantly, BLEU-4 is not decomposable6: as it relies on 4-grams statistics, the contribution of each phrase pair to the global score depends on the translation of the previous and following phrases and can not be evaluated in isolation. Because of its nondecomposability, maximizing BLEU-4 is hard; in particular, the phrase-level decomposability of the evaluation × metric is necessary in our approach. To circumvent this difficulty, we propose to evaluate the similarity between a translation hypothesis and a reference by the number of their common words. This amounts to evaluating translation quality in terms of unigram precision and recall, which are highly correlated with human judgements (Lavie et al., ). This measure is closely related to the BLEU-1 evaluation metric and the Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) metric (when it is evaluated without considering near-matches and the distortion penalty). We also believe that hypotheses that maximize the unigram precision and recall at the sentence level yield corpus level BLEU-4 scores close the maximal achievable. Indeed, in the setting we will introduce in the next section, BLEU-1 and BLEU-4 are highly correlated: as all correct words of the hypothesis will be compelled to be at their correct position, any hypothesis with a high 1-gram precision is also bound to have a high 2-gram precision, etc. 2.2 Formalizing the Oracle Decoding Problem The oracle decoding problem has already been considered in the case of word-based models, in which all translation units are bound to contain only one word. The problem can then be solved by a bipartite graph matching algorithm (Leusch et al., 2008): given a n m binary matarligxo describing possible t 2r0an08sl)a:ti goinv elinn aks n b×emtw beeinna source words and target words7, this algorithm finds the subset of links maximizing the number of words of the reference that have been translated, while ensuring that each word 6Neither at the sentence (Chiang et al., 2008), nor at the phrase level. 7The (i, j) entry of the matrix is 1if the ith word of the source can be translated by the jth word of the reference, 0 otherwise. 935 is translated only once. Generalizing this approach to phrase-based systems amounts to solving the following problem: given a set of possible translation links between potential phrases of the source and of the target, find the subset of links so that the unigram precision and recall are the highest possible. The corresponding oracle hypothesis can then be easily generated by selecting the target phrases that are aligned with one source phrase, disregarding the others. In addition, to mimic the way OOVs are usually handled, we match identical OOV tokens appearing both in the source and target sentences. In this approach, the unigram precision is always one (every word generated in the oracle hypothesis matches exactly one word in the reference). As a consequence, to find the oracle hypothesis, we just have to maximize the recall, that is the number of words appearing both in the hypothesis and in the reference. Considering phrases instead of isolated words has a major impact on the computational complexity: in this new setting, the optimal segmentations in phrases of both the source and of the target have to be worked out in addition to links selection. Moreover, constraints have to be taken into account so as to enforce a proper segmentation of the source and target sentences. These constraints make it impossible to use the approach of (Leusch et al., 2008) and concur in making the oracle decoding problem for phrase-based models more complex than it is for word-based models: it can be proven, using arguments borrowed from (De Nero and Klein, 2008), that this problem is NP-hard even for the simple unigram precision measure. 2.3 An Integer Program for Oracle Decoding To solve the combinatorial problem introduced in the previous section, we propose to cast it into an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, for which many generic solvers exist. ILP has already been used in SMT to find the optimal translation for word-based (Germann et al., 2001) and to study the complexity of learning phrase alignments (De Nero and Klein, 2008) models. Following the latter reference, we introduce the following variables: fi,j (resp. ek,l) is a binary indicator variable that is true when the phrase contains all spans from betweenword position i to j (resp. k to l) of the source (resp. target) sentence. We also introduce a binary variable, denoted ai,j,k,l, to describe a possible link between source phrase fi,j and target phrase ek,l. These variables are built from the entries of the phrase table according to selection strategies introduced in Section 2.4. In the following, index variables are so that: 0 ≤ i< j ≤ n, in the source sentence and 0 ≤ k < l ≤ m, in the target sentence, where n (resp. m) is the length of the source (resp. target) sentence. Solving the oracle decoding problem then amounts to optimizing the following objective function: mi,j,akx,li,Xj,k,lai,j,k,l· (l − k), (1) under the constraints: X ∀x ∈ J1,mK : ek,l ≤ 1 (2) = (3) 1∀,kn,lK : Xai,j,k,l = fk,l (4) ∀i,j : Xai,j,k,l (5) k,l s.tX. Xk≤x≤l ∀∀xy ∈∈ J11,,mnKK : X i,j s.tX. Xi≤y≤j fi,j 1 Xi,j = ei,j Xk,l The objective function (1) corresponds to the number of target words that are generated. The first set of constraints (2) ensures that each word in the reference e ap- pears in no more than one phrase. Maximizing the objective under these constraints amounts to maximizing the unigram recall. The second set of constraints (3) ensures that each word in the source f is translated exactly once, which guarantees that the search space of the ILP problem is the same as the search space of a phrase-based system. Constraints (4) bind the fk,l and ai,j,k,l variables, ensuring that whenever a link ai,j,k,l is active, the corresponding phrase fk,l is also active. Constraints (5) play a similar role for the reference. The Relaxed Problem Even though it accurately models the search space of a phrase-based decoder, this programs is not really useful as is: due to out-ofvocabulary words or missing entries in the phrase table, the constraint that all source words should be translated yields infeasible problems8. We propose to relax this problem and allow some source words to remain untranslated. This is done by replacing constraints (3) by: ∀y ∈ J1,nK : X i,j s.tX. Xi≤y≤j fi,j ≤ 1 To better ref∀lyec ∈t th J1e, bneKh :avior of phrase-based decoders, which attempt to translate all source words, we also need to modify the objective function as follows: X i,Xj,k,l ai,j,k,l · (l − k) +Xfi,j · (j − i) Xi,j (6) The second term in this new objective ensures that optimal solutions translate as many source words as possible. 8An ILP problem is said to be infeasible when tion violates at least one constraint. every possible solu- 936 The Relaxed-Distortion Problem A last caveat with the Relaxed optimization program is caused by frequently occurring source tokens, such as function words or punctuation signs, which can often align with more than one target word. For lack of taking distortion information into account in our objective function, all these alignments are deemed equivalent, even if some of them are clearly more satisfactory than others. This situation is illustrated on Figure 1. le chat et the cat and le the chien dog Figure 1: Equivalent alignments between “le” and “the”. The dashed lines corresponds to a less interpretable solution. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a last change to the objective function: X i,Xj,k,l ai,j,k,l · (l − k) +Xfi,j · (j − i) X ai,j,k,l|k − i| Xi,j −α (7) i Xk ,l X,j, Compared to the objective function of the relaxed problem (6), we introduce here a supplementary penalty factor which favors monotonous alignments. For each phrase pair, the higher the difference between source and target positions, the higher this penalty. If α is small enough, this extra term allows us to select, among all the optimal alignments of the re l axed problem, the one with the lowest distortion. In our experiments, we set α to min {n, m} to ensure that the penalty factor is always smminall{enr, ,tmha}n tthoe e rneswuarred t fhoart aligning atwltyo single iwso ardlwsa. 2.4 Selecting Indicator Variables In the approach introduced in the previous sections, the oracle decoding problem is solved by selecting, among a set of possible translation links, the ones that yield the solution with the highest unigram recall. We propose two strategies to build this set of possible translation links. In the first one, denoted exact match, an indicator ai,j,k,l is created if there is an entry (f, e) so that f spans from word position ito j in the source and e from word position k to l in the target. In this strategy, the ILP program considers exactly the same ruleset as conventional phrase-based decoders. We also consider an alternative strategy, which could help us to identify errors made during the phrase extraction process. In this strategy, denoted inside match, an indicator ai,j,k,l is created when the following three criteria are met: i) f spans from position ito j of the source; ii) a substring of e, denoted e, spans from position k to l of the reference; iii) (f, e¯) is not an entry of the phrase table. The resulting set of indicator variables thus contains, at least, all the variables used in the exact match strategy. In addition, we license here the use of phrases containing words that do not occur in the reference. In fact, using such solutions can yield higher BLEU scores when the reward for additional correct matches exceeds the cost incurred by wrong predictions. These cases are symptoms of situations where the extraction heuristic failed to extract potentially useful subphrases. 2.5 Oracle Decoding with Reordering Constraints The ILP problem introduced in the previous section can be extended in several ways to describe and test various improvements to phrase-based systems or to evaluate the impact of different parameter settings. This flexibility mainly stems from the possibility offered by our framework to express arbitrary constraints over variables. In this section, we illustrate these possibilities by describing how reordering constraints can easily be considered. As a first example, the Moses decoder uses a distortion limit to constrain the set of possible reorderings. This constraint “enforces (...) that the last word of a phrase chosen for translation cannot be more than d9 words from the leftmost untranslated word in the source” (Lopez, 2009) and is expressed as: ∀aijkl , ai0j0k0l0 s.t. k > k0, aijkl · ai0j0k0l0 · |j − i0 + 1| ≤ d, The maximum distortion limit strategy (Lopez, 2009) is also easily expressed and take the following form (assuming this constraint is parameterized by d): ∀l < m − 1, ai,j,k,l·ai0,j0,l+1,l0 · |i0 − j − 1| 71is%t e6hs.a distortion greater that Moses default distortion limit. alignment decisions enabled by the use of larger training corpora and phrase table. To evaluate the impact ofthe second heuristic, we computed the number of phrases discarded by Moses (be- cause of the default ttl limit) but used in the oracle hypotheses. In the English to French NEWSCO setting, they account for 34.11% of the total number of phrases used in the oracle hypotheses. When the oracle decoder is constrained to use the same phrase table as Moses, its BLEU-4 score drops to 42.78. This shows that filtering the phrase table prior to decoding discards many useful phrase pairs and is seriously limiting the best achievable performance, a conclusion shared with (Auli et al., 2009). Search Errors Search errors can be identified by comparing the score of the best hypothesis found by Moses and the score of the oracle hypothesis. If the score of the oracle hypothesis is higher, then there has been a search error; on the contrary, there has been an estimation error when the score of the oracle hypothesis is lower than the score of the best hypothesis found by Moses. 940 Based on the comparison of the score of Moses hypotheses and of oracle hypotheses for the English to French NEWSCO setting, our preliminary conclusion is that the number of search errors is quite limited: only about 5% of the hypotheses of our oracle decoder are actually getting a better score than Moses solutions. Again, this shows that the scoring function (model error) is one of the main bottleneck of current PBTS. Comparing these hypotheses is nonetheless quite revealing: while Moses mostly selects phrase pairs with high translation scores and generates monotonous alignments, our ILP decoder uses larger reorderings and less probable phrases to achieve better solutions: on average, the reordering score of oracle solutions is −5.74, compared to −76.78 fscoro rMeo osfe osr outputs. iGonivsen is −the5 weight assigned through MERT training to the distortion score, no wonder that these hypotheses are severely penalized. The Impact of Phrase Length The observed outputs do not only depend on decisions made during the search, but also on decisions made during training. One such decision is the specification of maximal length for the source and target phrases. In our framework, evaluating the impact of this decision is simple: it suffices to change the definition of indicator variables so as to consider only alignments between phrases of a given length. In the English-French NEWSCO setting, the most restrictive choice, when only alignments between single words are authorized, yields an oracle BLEU-4 of 48.68; however, authorizing phrases up to length 2 allows to achieve an oracle value of 66.57, very close to the score achieved when considering all extracted phrases (67.77). This is corroborated with a further analysis of our oracle alignments, which use phrases whose average source length is 1.21 words (respectively 1.31 for target words). If many studies have already acknowledged the predomi- nance of “small” phrases in actual translations, our oracle scores suggest that, for this language pair, increasing the phrase length limit beyond 2 or 3 might be a waste of computational resources. 4 Related Work To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few works that try to study the expressive power ofphrase-based machine translation systems or to provide tools for analyzing potential causes of failure. The approach described in (Auli et al., 2009) is very similar to ours: in this study, the authors propose to find and analyze the limits of machine translation systems by studying the reference reachability. A reference is reachable for a given system if it can be exactly generated by this system. Reference reachability is assessed using Moses in forced decoding mode: during search, all hypotheses that deviate from the reference are simply discarded. Even though the main goal of this study was to compare the search space of phrase-based and hierarchical systems, it also provides some insights on the impact of various search parameters in Moses, delivering conclusions that are consistent with our main results. As described in Section 1.2, these authors also propose a typology of the errors of a statistical translation systems, but do not attempt to provide methods for identifying them. The authors of (Turchi et al., 2008) study the learn- ing capabilities of Moses by extensively analyzing learning curves representing the translation performances as a function of the number of examples, and by corrupting the model parameters. Even though their focus is more on assessing the scoring function, they reach conclusions similar to ours: the current bottleneck of translation performances is not the representation power of the PBTS but rather in their scoring functions. Oracle decoding is useful to compute reachable pseudo-references in the context of discriminative training. This is the main motivation of (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006), where the authors compute high BLEU hypotheses by running a conventional decoder so as to maximize a per-sentence approximation of BLEU-4, under a simple (local) reordering model. Oracle decoding has also been used to assess the limitations induced by various reordering constraints in (Dreyer et al., 2007). To this end, the authors propose to use a beam-search based oracle decoder, which computes lower bounds of the best achievable BLEU-4 using dynamic programming techniques over finite-state (for so-called local and IBM constraints) or hierarchically structured (for ITG constraints) sets of hypotheses. Even 941 though the numbers reported in this study are not directly comparable with ours17, it seems that our decoder is not only conceptually much simpler, but also achieves much more optimistic lower-bounds of the oracle BLEU score. The approach described in (Li and Khudanpur, 2009) employs a similar technique, which is to guide a heuristic search in an hypergraph representing possible translation hypotheses with n-gram counts matches, which amounts to decoding with a n-gram model trained on the sole reference translation. Additional tricks are presented in this article to speed-up decoding. Computing oracle BLEU scores is also the subject of (Zens and Ney, 2005; Leusch et al., 2008), yet with a different emphasis. These studies are concerned with finding the best hypotheses in a word graph or in a consensus network, a problem that has various implications for multi-pass decoding and/or system combination techniques. The former reference describes an exponential approximate algorithm, while the latter proves the NPcompleteness of this problem and discuss various heuristic approaches. Our problem is somewhat more complex and using their techniques would require us to built word graphs containing all the translations induced by arbitrary segmentations and permutations of the source sentence. 5 Conclusions In this paper, we have presented a methodology for analyzing the errors of PBTS, based on the computation of an approximation of the BLEU-4 oracle score. We have shown that this approximation could be computed fairly accurately and efficiently using Integer Linear Programming techniques. Our main result is a confirmation of the fact that extant PBTS systems are expressive enough to achieve very high translation performance with respect to conventional quality measurements. The main efforts should therefore strive to improve on the way phrases and hypotheses are scored during training. This gives further support to attempts aimed at designing context-dependent scoring functions as in (Stroppa et al., 2007; Gimpel and Smith, 2008), or at attempts to perform discriminative training of feature-rich models. (Bangalore et al., 2007). We have shown that the examination of difficult-totranslate sentences was an effective way to detect errors or inconsistencies in the reference translations, making our approach a potential aid for controlling the quality or assessing the difficulty of test data. Our experiments have also highlighted the impact of various parameters. Various extensions of the baseline ILP program have been suggested and/or evaluated. In particular, the ILP formalism lends itself well to expressing various constraints that are typically used in conventional PBTS. In 17The best BLEU-4 oracle they achieve on Europarl German to English is approximately 48; but they considered a smaller version of the training corpus and the WMT’06 test set. our future work, we aim at using this ILP framework to systematically assess various search configurations. We plan to explore how replacing non-reachable references with high-score pseudo-references can improve discrim- inative training of PBTS. We are also concerned by determining how tight is our approximation of the BLEU4 score is: to this end, we intend to compute the best BLEU-4 score within the n-best solutions of the oracle decoding problem.

<p>Author: Chang Liu ; Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present PEM, the first fully automatic metric to evaluate the quality of paraphrases, and consequently, that of paraphrase generation systems. Our metric is based on three criteria: adequacy, fluency, and lexical dissimilarity. The key component in our metric is a robust and shallow semantic similarity measure based on pivot language N-grams that allows us to approximate adequacy independently of lexical similarity. Human evaluation shows that PEM achieves high correlation with human judgments.</p><p>5 0.75534171 <a title="78-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Fusing_Eye_Gaze_with_Speech_Recognition_Hypotheses_to_Resolve_Exophoric_References_in_Situated_Dialogue.html">53 emnlp-2010-Fusing Eye Gaze with Speech Recognition Hypotheses to Resolve Exophoric References in Situated Dialogue</a></p>
<p>Author: Zahar Prasov ; Joyce Y. Chai</p><p>Abstract: In situated dialogue humans often utter linguistic expressions that refer to extralinguistic entities in the environment. Correctly resolving these references is critical yet challenging for artificial agents partly due to their limited speech recognition and language understanding capabilities. Motivated by psycholinguistic studies demonstrating a tight link between language production and human eye gaze, we have developed approaches that integrate naturally occurring human eye gaze with speech recognition hypotheses to resolve exophoric references in situated dialogue in a virtual world. In addition to incorporating eye gaze with the best recognized spoken hypothesis, we developed an algorithm to also handle multiple hypotheses modeled as word confusion networks. Our empirical results demonstrate that incorporating eye gaze with recognition hypotheses consistently outperforms the results obtained from processing recognition hypotheses alone. Incorporating eye gaze with word confusion networks further improves performance.</p><p>6 0.7498824 <a title="78-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Discriminative_Word_Alignment_with_a_Function_Word_Reordering_Model.html">36 emnlp-2010-Discriminative Word Alignment with a Function Word Reordering Model</a></p>

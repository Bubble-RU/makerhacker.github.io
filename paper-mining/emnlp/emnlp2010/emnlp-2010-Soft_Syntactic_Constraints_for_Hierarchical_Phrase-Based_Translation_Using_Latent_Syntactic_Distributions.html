<p>Author: Adria de Gispert ; Juan Pino ; William Byrne</p><p>Abstract: We report on investigations into hierarchical phrase-based translation grammars based on rules extracted from posterior distributions over alignments of the parallel text. Rather than restrict rule extraction to a single alignment, such as Viterbi, we instead extract rules based on posterior distributions provided by the HMM word-to-word alignmentmodel. We define translation grammars progressively by adding classes of rules to a basic phrase-based system. We assess these grammars in terms of their expressive power, measured by their ability to align the parallel text from which their rules are extracted, and the quality of the translations they yield. In Chinese-to-English translation, we find that rule extraction from posteriors gives translation improvements. We also find that grammars with rules with only one nonterminal, when extracted from posteri- ors, can outperform more complex grammars extracted from Viterbi alignments. Finally, we show that the best way to exploit source-totarget and target-to-source alignment models is to build two separate systems and combine their output translation lattices.</p><p>3 0.30304375 <a title="98-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Non-Isomorphic_Forest_Pair_Translation.html">86 emnlp-2010-Non-Isomorphic Forest Pair Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Hui Zhang ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li ; Eng Siong Chng</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies two issues, non-isomorphic structure translation and target syntactic structure usage, for statistical machine translation in the context of forest-based tree to tree sequence translation. For the first issue, we propose a novel non-isomorphic translation framework to capture more non-isomorphic structure mappings than traditional tree-based and tree-sequence-based translation methods. For the second issue, we propose a parallel space searching method to generate hypothesis using tree-to-string model and evaluate its syntactic goodness using tree-to-tree/tree sequence model. This not only reduces the search complexity by merging spurious-ambiguity translation paths and solves the data sparseness issue in training, but also serves as a syntax-based target language model for better grammatical generation. Experiment results on the benchmark data show our proposed two solutions are very effective, achieving significant performance improvement over baselines when applying to different translation models.</p><p>4 0.17373736 <a title="98-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-SCFG_Decoding_Without_Binarization.html">94 emnlp-2010-SCFG Decoding Without Binarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Hopkins ; Greg Langmead</p><p>Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) must be converted to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) to ensure cubic time decoding. For arbitrary SCFGs, this is typically accomplished via the synchronous binarization technique of (Zhang et al., 2006). A drawback to this approach is that it inflates the constant factors associated with decoding, and thus the practical running time. (DeNero et al., 2009) tackle this problem by defining a superset of CNF called Lexical Normal Form (LNF), which also supports cubic time decoding under certain implicit assumptions. In this paper, we make these assumptions explicit, and in doing so, show that LNF can be further expanded to a broader class of grammars (called “scope3”) that also supports cubic-time decoding. By simply pruning non-scope-3 rules from a GHKM-extracted grammar, we obtain better translation performance than synchronous binarization.</p><p>5 0.17049891 <a title="98-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Top-Down_Nearly-Context-Sensitive_Parsing.html">106 emnlp-2010-Top-Down Nearly-Context-Sensitive Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Eugene Charniak</p><p>Abstract: We present a new syntactic parser that works left-to-right and top down, thus maintaining a fully-connected parse tree for a few alternative parse hypotheses. All of the commonly used statistical parsers use context-free dynamic programming algorithms and as such work bottom up on the entire sentence. Thus they only find a complete fully connected parse at the very end. In contrast, both subjective and experimental evidence show that people understand a sentence word-to-word as they go along, or close to it. The constraint that the parser keeps one or more fully connected syntactic trees is intended to operationalize this cognitive fact. Our parser achieves a new best result for topdown parsers of 89.4%,a 20% error reduction over the previous single-parser best result for parsers of this type of 86.8% (Roark, 2001) . The improved performance is due to embracing the very large feature set available in exchange for giving up dynamic programming.</p><p>6 0.16695781 <a title="98-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Efficient_Incremental_Decoding_for_Tree-to-String_Translation.html">42 emnlp-2010-Efficient Incremental Decoding for Tree-to-String Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Liang Huang ; Haitao Mi</p><p>Abstract: Syntax-based translation models should in principle be efficient with polynomially-sized search space, but in practice they are often embarassingly slow, partly due to the cost of language model integration. In this paper we borrow from phrase-based decoding the idea to generate a translation incrementally left-to-right, and show that for tree-to-string models, with a clever encoding of derivation history, this method runs in averagecase polynomial-time in theory, and lineartime with beam search in practice (whereas phrase-based decoding is exponential-time in theory and quadratic-time in practice). Experiments show that, with comparable translation quality, our tree-to-string system (in Python) can run more than 30 times faster than the phrase-based system Moses (in C++).</p><p>6 0.5648576 <a title="98-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Maximum_Entropy_Based_Phrase_Reordering_for_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation.html">76 emnlp-2010-Maximum Entropy Based Phrase Reordering for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Zahar Prasov ; Joyce Y. Chai</p><p>Abstract: In situated dialogue humans often utter linguistic expressions that refer to extralinguistic entities in the environment. Correctly resolving these references is critical yet challenging for artificial agents partly due to their limited speech recognition and language understanding capabilities. Motivated by psycholinguistic studies demonstrating a tight link between language production and human eye gaze, we have developed approaches that integrate naturally occurring human eye gaze with speech recognition hypotheses to resolve exophoric references in situated dialogue in a virtual world. In addition to incorporating eye gaze with the best recognized spoken hypothesis, we developed an algorithm to also handle multiple hypotheses modeled as word confusion networks. Our empirical results demonstrate that incorporating eye gaze with recognition hypotheses consistently outperforms the results obtained from processing recognition hypotheses alone. Incorporating eye gaze with word confusion networks further improves performance.</p><p>3 0.67948025 <a title="98-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation_Grammars_Extracted_from_Alignment_Posterior_Probabilities.html">57 emnlp-2010-Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation Grammars Extracted from Alignment Posterior Probabilities</a></p>
<p>Author: Adria de Gispert ; Juan Pino ; William Byrne</p><p>Abstract: We report on investigations into hierarchical phrase-based translation grammars based on rules extracted from posterior distributions over alignments of the parallel text. Rather than restrict rule extraction to a single alignment, such as Viterbi, we instead extract rules based on posterior distributions provided by the HMM word-to-word alignmentmodel. We define translation grammars progressively by adding classes of rules to a basic phrase-based system. We assess these grammars in terms of their expressive power, measured by their ability to align the parallel text from which their rules are extracted, and the quality of the translations they yield. In Chinese-to-English translation, we find that rule extraction from posteriors gives translation improvements. We also find that grammars with rules with only one nonterminal, when extracted from posteri- ors, can outperform more complex grammars extracted from Viterbi alignments. Finally, we show that the best way to exploit source-totarget and target-to-source alignment models is to build two separate systems and combine their output translation lattices.</p><p>4 0.64661407 <a title="98-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-SCFG_Decoding_Without_Binarization.html">94 emnlp-2010-SCFG Decoding Without Binarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Hopkins ; Greg Langmead</p><p>Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) must be converted to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) to ensure cubic time decoding. For arbitrary SCFGs, this is typically accomplished via the synchronous binarization technique of (Zhang et al., 2006). A drawback to this approach is that it inflates the constant factors associated with decoding, and thus the practical running time. (DeNero et al., 2009) tackle this problem by defining a superset of CNF called Lexical Normal Form (LNF), which also supports cubic time decoding under certain implicit assumptions. In this paper, we make these assumptions explicit, and in doing so, show that LNF can be further expanded to a broader class of grammars (called “scope3”) that also supports cubic-time decoding. By simply pruning non-scope-3 rules from a GHKM-extracted grammar, we obtain better translation performance than synchronous binarization.</p><p>5 0.64152598 <a title="98-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Discriminative_Word_Alignment_with_a_Function_Word_Reordering_Model.html">36 emnlp-2010-Discriminative Word Alignment with a Function Word Reordering Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Chris Dyer ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: We address the modeling, parameter estimation and search challenges that arise from the introduction of reordering models that capture non-local reordering in alignment modeling. In particular, we introduce several reordering models that utilize (pairs of) function words as contexts for alignment reordering. To address the parameter estimation challenge, we propose to estimate these reordering models from a relatively small amount of manuallyaligned corpora. To address the search challenge, we devise an iterative local search algorithm that stochastically explores reordering possibilities. By capturing non-local reordering phenomena, our proposed alignment model bears a closer resemblance to stateof-the-art translation model. Empirical results show significant improvements in alignment quality as well as in translation performance over baselines in a large-scale ChineseEnglish translation task.</p><p>6 0.6085884 <a title="98-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Maximum_Entropy_Based_Phrase_Reordering_for_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation.html">76 emnlp-2010-Maximum Entropy Based Phrase Reordering for Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation</a></p>

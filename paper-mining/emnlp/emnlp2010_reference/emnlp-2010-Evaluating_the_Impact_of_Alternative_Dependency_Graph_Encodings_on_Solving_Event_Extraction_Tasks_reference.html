<h1>46 emnlp-2010-Evaluating the Impact of Alternative Dependency Graph Encodings on Solving Event Extraction Tasks</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2010-46-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D10/D10-1096.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ekaterina Buyko ; Udo Hahn</p><p>Abstract: In state-of-the-art approaches to information extraction (IE), dependency graphs constitute the fundamental data structure for syntactic structuring and subsequent knowledge elicitation from natural language documents. The top-performing systems in the BioNLP 2009 Shared Task on Event Extraction all shared the idea to use dependency structures generated by a variety of parsers either directly or in some converted manner — and optionally modified their output to fit the special needs of IE. As there are systematic differences between various dependency representations being used in this competition, we scrutinize on different encoding styles for dependency information and their possible impact on solving several IE tasks. After assessing more or less established dependency representations such as the Stanford and CoNLL-X dependen— cies, we will then focus on trimming operations that pave the way to more effective IE. Our evaluation study covers data from a number of constituency- and dependency-based parsers and provides experimental evidence which dependency representations are particularly beneficial for the event extraction task. Based on empirical findings from our study we were able to achieve the performance of 57.2% F-score on the development data set of the BioNLP Shared Task 2009.</p><br/>

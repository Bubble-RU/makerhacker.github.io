<h1>70 emnlp-2010-Jointly Modeling Aspects and Opinions with a MaxEnt-LDA Hybrid</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2010-70-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D10/D10-1006.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Xin Zhao ; Jing Jiang ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Discovering and summarizing opinions from online reviews is an important and challenging task. A commonly-adopted framework generates structured review summaries with aspects and opinions. Recently topic models have been used to identify meaningful review aspects, but existing topic models do not identify aspect-specific opinion words. In this paper, we propose a MaxEnt-LDA hybrid model to jointly discover both aspects and aspect-specific opinion words. We show that with a relatively small amount of training data, our model can effectively identify aspect and opinion words simultaneously. We also demonstrate the domain adaptability of our model.</p><br/>

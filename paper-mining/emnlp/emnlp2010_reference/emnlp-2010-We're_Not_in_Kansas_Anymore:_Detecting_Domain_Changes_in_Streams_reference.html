<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2010-119-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D10/D10-1057.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Mark Dredze ; Tim Oates ; Christine Piatko</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation, the problem of adapting a natural language processing system trained in one domain to perform well in a different domain, has received significant attention. This paper addresses an important problem for deployed systems that has received little attention – detecting when such adaptation is needed by a system operating in the wild, i.e., performing classification over a stream of unlabeled examples. Our method uses Aodifst uannlaceb,e a dm eextraicm fpolre detecting tshhoifdts u sine sd Aatastreams, combined with classification margins to detect domain shifts. We empirically show effective domain shift detection on a variety of data sets and shift conditions.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2010-74-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D10/D10-1010.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Razvan Bunescu ; Yunfeng Huang</p><p>Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for the task of ranking previously answered questions in a question repository with respect to their relevance to a new, unanswered reference question. The ranking model is trained on a collection of question groups manually annotated with a partial order relation reflecting the relative utility of questions inside each group. Based on a set of meaning and structure aware features, the new ranking model is able to substantially outperform more straightforward, unsupervised similarity measures.</p><br/>

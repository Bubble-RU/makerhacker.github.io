<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2010-103-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D10/D10-1032.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Roi Reichart ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: Polysemy is a major characteristic of natural languages. Like words, syntactic forms can have several meanings. Understanding the correct meaning of a syntactic form is of great importance to many NLP applications. In this paper we address an important type of syntactic polysemy the multiple possible senses of tense syntactic forms. We make our discussion concrete by introducing the task of Tense Sense Disambiguation (TSD): given a concrete tense syntactic form present in a sentence, select its appropriate sense among a set of possible senses. Using English grammar textbooks, we compiled a syntactic sense dictionary comprising common tense syntactic forms and semantic senses for each. We annotated thousands of BNC sentences using the – defined senses. We describe a supervised TSD algorithm trained on these annotations, which outperforms a strong baseline for the task.</p><br/>

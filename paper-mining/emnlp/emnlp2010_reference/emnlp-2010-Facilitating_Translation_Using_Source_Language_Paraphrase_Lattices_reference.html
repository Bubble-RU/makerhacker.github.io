<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2010-50-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D10/D10-1041.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Jinhua Du ; Jie Jiang ; Andy Way</p><p>Abstract: For resource-limited language pairs, coverage of the test set by the parallel corpus is an important factor that affects translation quality in two respects: 1) out of vocabulary words; 2) the same information in an input sentence can be expressed in different ways, while current phrase-based SMT systems cannot automatically select an alternative way to transfer the same information. Therefore, given limited data, in order to facilitate translation from the input side, this paper proposes a novel method to reduce the translation difficulty using source-side lattice-based paraphrases. We utilise the original phrases from the input sentence and the corresponding paraphrases to build a lattice with estimated weights for each edge to improve translation quality. Compared to the baseline system, our method achieves relative improvements of 7.07%, 6.78% and 3.63% in terms of BLEU score on small, medium and large- scale English-to-Chinese translation tasks respectively. The results show that the proposed method is effective not only for resourcelimited language pairs, but also for resourcesufficient pairs to some extent.</p><br/>

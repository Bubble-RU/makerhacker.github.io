<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2010-44-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D10/D10-1097.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Yassine Benajiba ; Imed Zitouni</p><p>Abstract: The research question treated in this paper is centered on the idea of exploiting rich resources of one language to enhance the performance of a mention detection system of another one. We successfully achieve this goal by projecting information from one language to another via a parallel corpus. We examine the potential improvement using various degrees of linguistic information in a statistical framework and we show that the proposed technique is effective even when the target language model has access to a significantly rich feature set. Experimental results show up to 2.4F improvement in performance when the system has access to information obtained by projecting mentions from a resource-richlanguage mention detection system via a parallel corpus.</p><br/>

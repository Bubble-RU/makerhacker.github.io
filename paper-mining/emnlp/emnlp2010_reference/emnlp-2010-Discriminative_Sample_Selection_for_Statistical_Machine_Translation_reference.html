<h1>35 emnlp-2010-Discriminative Sample Selection for Statistical Machine Translation</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2010-35-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D10/D10-1061.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Sankaranarayanan Ananthakrishnan ; Rohit Prasad ; David Stallard ; Prem Natarajan</p><p>Abstract: Production of parallel training corpora for the development of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems for resource-poor languages usually requires extensive manual effort. Active sample selection aims to reduce the labor, time, and expense incurred in producing such resources, attaining a given performance benchmark with the smallest possible training corpus by choosing informative, nonredundant source sentences from an available candidate pool for manual translation. We present a novel, discriminative sample selection strategy that preferentially selects batches of candidate sentences with constructs that lead to erroneous translations on a held-out development set. The proposed strategy supports a built-in diversity mechanism that reduces redundancy in the selected batches. Simulation experiments on English-to-Pashto and Spanish-to-English translation tasks demon- strate the superiority of the proposed approach to a number of competing techniques, such as random selection, dissimilarity-based selection, as well as a recently proposed semisupervised active learning strategy.</p><br/>

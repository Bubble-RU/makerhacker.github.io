</p><p>2 We apply CountMin sketch to approximate word pair counts and exhibit their effectiveness on three important NLP tasks. [sent-6, score-0.803]
</p><p>3 Our experiments demonstrate that on all of the three tasks, we get performance comparable to Exact word pair counts setting and state-of-the-art system. [sent-7, score-0.225]
</p><p>4 Our method scales to 49 GB of unzipped web data using bounded space of 2 billion counters (8 GB memory). [sent-8, score-0.583]
</p><p>5 However, explicitly storing the counts of all word pairs is both computationally expensive and memory intensive (Agirre et al. [sent-38, score-0.364]
</p><p>6 We explore Count-Min (CM) sketch to address the issue of efficient storage of such data. [sent-42, score-0.607]
</p><p>7 The CM sketch stores counts of all word pairs within a bounded space. [sent-43, score-0.848]
</p><p>8 Storage space saving is achieved by approximating the frequency of word pairs in the corpus without explicitly storing the word pairs themselves. [sent-44, score-0.263]
</p><p>9 Both updating (adding a new word pair  or increasing the frequency of existing word pair) and querying (finding the frequency of a given word pair) are constant time operations making it efficient online storage data structure for large data. [sent-45, score-0.275]
</p><p>10 We use CM sketch to store counts of word pairs (except word pairs involving stop words) within a window of size1 7 over different size corpora. [sent-47, score-1.005]
</p><p>11 We store exact counts of words (except stop words) in hash table (since the number of unique words is not large that is quadratically less than the number of unique word pairs). [sent-48, score-0.492]
</p><p>12 The approximate PMI and LLR scores are computed using these approximate counts and are applied to solve our three NLP tasks. [sent-49, score-0.218]
</p><p>13 Our experiments demonstrate that on all of the three tasks, we get performance comparable to Exact word pair counts setting and state-of-the-art system. [sent-50, score-0.225]
</p><p>14 Our method scales to 49 GB of unzipped web data using bounded space of 2 billion counters (8 GB memory). [sent-51, score-0.583]
</p><p>15 2  Sketch Techniques  A sketch is a compact summary data structure to store the frequencies of all items in the input stream. [sent-55, score-0.685]
</p><p>16 Sketching techniques use hashing to map items in streaming data onto a small sketch vector that can be updated and queried in constant time. [sent-56, score-0.661]
</p><p>17 There exists an extensive literature on sketch techniques (Charikar et al. [sent-61, score-0.57]
</p><p>18 However, in practice, researchers have preferred Count-Min (CM) sketch over other sketch techniques in many application ar-  eas, such as Security (Schechter et al. [sent-64, score-1.14]
</p><p>19 This motivated us to explore CM sketch to solve three important NLP problems. [sent-68, score-0.57]
</p><p>20 1 Count-Min Sketch The Count-Min sketch (Cormode and Muthukrishnan, 2004) is a compact summary data structure used to store the frequencies of all items in the input stream. [sent-70, score-0.685]
</p><p>21 The sketch allows fundamental queries on the data stream such as point, range and inner product queries to be approximately answered very quickly. [sent-71, score-0.7]
</p><p>22 Given an input stream of word pairs of length N and user chosen parameters δ and ? [sent-76, score-0.221]
</p><p>23 , the algorithm stores the frequencies of all the word pairs with the following guarantees:  •  •  All reported frequencies are within the true frequencies by at most ? [sent-77, score-0.195]
</p><p>24 2In future, in another line of research, we will explore comparing different sketch techniques for NLP problems. [sent-81, score-0.57]
</p><p>25 1 CM Data Structure A Count-Min sketch (CM) with parameters (? [sent-85, score-0.57]
</p><p>26 The depth d denotes the number of pairwise-independent hash functions employed by the algorithm and there exists a one-toone correspondence between the rows and the set of hash functions. [sent-95, score-0.404]
</p><p>27 w}, 1 ≤ k ≤ d, takes a wo:r{dx pair from} →the input wstr}e,a1m ≤and k maps ,i tt aiknetos a counter indexed by the corresponding hash function. [sent-102, score-0.283]
</p><p>28 For example, h2 (x) = 10 indicates that the word pair “x” is mapped to the 10th position in the second row of the sketch array. [sent-103, score-0.631]
</p><p>29 Update Procedure: When a new word pair “x” with count c arrives, one counter in each row (as decided by its corresponding hash function) is updated by c. [sent-105, score-0.318]
</p><p>30 sketch[k, hk (x)]  ←  sketch[k, hk (x)] + c, ∀1 ≤ k ≤ d  Query Procedure: Since multiple word pairs can get hashed to the same position, the frequency stored  by each position is guaranteed to overestimate the true count. [sent-106, score-0.318]
</p><p>31 Thus, to answer the point query for a given word pair, we return minimum over all the positions indexed by the k hash functions. [sent-107, score-0.238]
</p><p>32 The answer to Query(x): = mink sketch[k, hk (x)] Both update and query procedures involve evaluating d hash functions and reading of all the values in those indices and hence both these procedures are linear in the number of hash functions. [sent-108, score-0.551]
</p><p>33 2 Properties Apart from the advantages of being space efficient, and having constant update and constant querying time, the Count-Min sketch has also other advantages that makes it an attractive choice for NLP applications. [sent-118, score-0.634]
</p><p>34 •  •  Linearity: Given two sketches s1 and s2 computed (using tehne same parameters w and d) over different input streams, the sketch of the combined data stream can be easily obtained by adding the individual sketches in O(1? [sent-119, score-0.862]
</p><p>35 The linearity is especially attractive because it aTlhloew lsin tehaer itnyd i sv eidsupeacl isaklleytc ahtetrsa ctot vbee computed independent of each other, which means that it is easy to implement it in distributed setting, where each machine computes the sketch over a sub set of corpus. [sent-121, score-0.599]
</p><p>36 This can easily be used with CM sketch to further improve the estimate of a point query. [sent-124, score-0.57]
</p><p>37 In our experiments, we found that employing the conservative update reduces the Average Relative Error (ARE) of these counts approximately by a factor of 1. [sent-127, score-0.251]
</p><p>38 3  Intrinsic Evaluations  To show the effectiveness of the CM sketch and CM sketch with conservative update (CU) in the context of NLP, we perform intrinsic evaluations. [sent-132, score-1.299]
</p><p>39 First, the intrinsic evaluations are designed to measure the error in the approximate counts returned by CM sketch compared to their true counts. [sent-133, score-0.827]
</p><p>40 Second, we compare the word pairs association rankings obtained using PMI and LLR with sketch and exact counts. [sent-134, score-0.787]
</p><p>41 We store exact counts of words (except stop words) in a hash table and store approximate counts of word pairs (except word pairs involving stop words) in the sketch. [sent-141, score-0.906]
</p><p>42 1 Evaluating approximate sketch counts To evaluate the amount of over-estimation error (see Section 2. [sent-143, score-0.742]
</p><p>43 1) in CM and CU counts compared to the true counts, we first group all word pairs with the same true frequency into a single bucket. [sent-144, score-0.304]
</p><p>44 Average Relative error (ARE) is defined as the average of absolute difference between the predicted and the exact value divided by the exact value over all the word  pairs in each bucket. [sent-148, score-0.233]
</p><p>45 ARE =N1iX=N1|ExactiE−x Pacretidictedi| Where Exact and Predicted denotes values of exact and CM/CU counts respectively; N denotes the number of word pairs with same counts in a bucket. [sent-149, score-0.414]
</p><p>46 1(a), we fixed the number ofcounters to 20 million (20M) with four bytes of memory per each counter (thus it only requires 80 MB of main memory). [sent-151, score-0.255]
</p><p>47 Keeping the total number of counters fixed, we try different values of depth (2, 3, 5 and 7) of the sketch array and in each case the width is set to 20dM. [sent-152, score-1.146]
</p><p>48 5) for the runs which use conservative update (CUx run) compared to the runs that use direct CM sketch (CMx run). [sent-158, score-0.695]
</p><p>49 To be more certain about this behavior with respect to different settings of width and depth, we tried another setting by increasing the number of counters to 50 million. [sent-161, score-0.481]
</p><p>50 Low frequency word pairs are more prone to error compared to the frequent ones and employing conservative update reduces the ARE by a factor of 1. [sent-163, score-0.251]
</p><p>51 We use CU counts and depth of 5 for the rest of the paper. [sent-166, score-0.2]
</p><p>52 As 3 and 5 have lowest ARE in different settings and using 5 hash functions, we get δ = 0. [sent-167, score-0.203]
</p><p>53 1(c) studies the effect of the number of counters in the sketch (the size of the two-dimensional sketch array) on the ARE with fixed depth 5. [sent-172, score-1.621]
</p><p>54 This is intuitive because, as the length of each row in the sketch increases, the probability of collision decreases and hence the array is more likely to contain true counts. [sent-174, score-0.682]
</p><p>55 The notation CMx represents the Count Min sketch with a depth of ’x’ and CUx represents the CM sketch along with conservative update and depth ’x’ . [sent-176, score-1.413]
</p><p>56 Note that the space we save by not storing the exact counts is almost four times the memory that we use here because on an average each word pair is twelve characters long and requires twelve bytes (thrice the size of an integer) and 4 bytes for storing  the integer count. [sent-178, score-0.488]
</p><p>57 2 Evaluating word pairs association ranking In this experiment, we compare the word pairs association rankings obtained using PMI and LLR with CU and exact word pair counts. [sent-181, score-0.369]
</p><p>58 Intuitively, recall captures the number of word pairs that are found in both the sets and then Spearman’s correlation captures if the relative order of these common word pairs is preserved in both the rankings. [sent-183, score-0.182]
</p><p>59 The results with respect to different sized counter (20 million (20M), 50 million (50M)) models are shown in Table 1. [sent-185, score-0.195]
</p><p>60 If we compare the second and third column of the table using PMI and LLR for 20M counters, we get exact rankings for LLR compared to PMI while comparing TopK word pairs. [sent-186, score-0.199]
</p><p>61 The explanation for such a behavior is: since we are  3Even with other datasets we found that using counters linear in the size of the stream leads to ARE close to zero ∀ counts. [sent-187, score-0.537]
</p><p>62 254  CM sketch with conservative update (CU) and Exact counts not throwing away any infrequent word pairs, PMI will rank pairs with low frequency counts higher (Church and Hanks, 1989). [sent-188, score-1.073]
</p><p>63 Hence, we are evaluating the PMI values for rare word pairs and we need counters linear in size of stream to get almost perfect ranking. [sent-189, score-0.666]
</p><p>64 This is also evident from the fourth column for 50M of the Table 1, where CU PMI ranking gets close to the optimal as the number of counters ap-  proaches stream size. [sent-190, score-0.537]
</p><p>65 In such cases, even using space less than linear in number of counters would suffice. [sent-192, score-0.407]
</p><p>66 We store exact counts of words in a hash table and store approximate counts of word pairs in the sketch. [sent-201, score-0.753]
</p><p>67 Hence, the stream size  in our case is the total number of word pairs in a corpus. [sent-202, score-0.221]
</p><p>68 Figure 2: Evaluating Semantic Orientation using PMI and LLR with different number of counters of CU sketch built using Gigaword. [sent-224, score-0.977]
</p><p>69 1 Varying sketch size We evaluate SO of words using PMI and LLR on Gigaword (9. [sent-227, score-0.57]
</p><p>70 We compare approximate SO computed using varying sizes of CU sketches: 50 million (50M), 100M, 200M, 500M, 1billion (1B) and 2 billion (2B) counters with Exact SO. [sent-229, score-0.56]
</p><p>71 Note that computing the exact counts of all word pairs on these corpora is com-  putationally expensive and memory intensive, so we consider only those pairs in which one word appears in the prototype list and the other word appears in the test set. [sent-231, score-0.482]
</p><p>72 Second, nfcore b bootuhn PdMaryI faonrd a LLR, having more number of counters improve performance. [sent-235, score-0.407]
</p><p>73 ±  5We use maximum of 2B counters (8GB main memory), as most of the current desktop machines have at most 8GB RAM. [sent-237, score-0.407]
</p><p>74 Second, we will fix number of counters to 2B (CU-2B) as it performs the best in Section 4. [sent-245, score-0.407]
</p><p>75 Hence, it shows that using counters less than the stream length does not degrade the performance. [sent-259, score-0.537]
</p><p>76 Once, we have context vectors for each of the terms,  cosine similarity measure returns distributional similarity between terms. [sent-267, score-0.171]
</p><p>77 1 Efficient Distributional Similarity We propose an efficient approach for computing distributional similarity between word pairs using CU sketch. [sent-270, score-0.216]
</p><p>78 In the first step, we traverse the corpus and store counts of all words (except stop words) in hash table and all word pairs (except word pairs involving stop words) in sketch. [sent-271, score-0.599]
</p><p>79 ), and query the sketch for vocabulary number of word pairs, and compute approximate AS between word-context pairs. [sent-274, score-0.689]
</p><p>80 In the third step, we use cosine similarity using these approximate top K context vectors to compute efficient distributional similarity. [sent-276, score-0.171]
</p><p>81 The efficient distributional similarity using sketches has following advantages: •  It can return semantic similarity between any  Iwto cradn pairs rtnha ste are nsttiocre sdim minil tahriet ysk betecthw. [sent-277, score-0.308]
</p><p>82 We generate the word pair rankings using efficient distributional similarity. [sent-286, score-0.195]
</p><p>83 5BECxUact2B (a) Word Similarity PMI  (b) Word Similarity LLR  Figure 4: Evaluating Distributional Similarity between word pairs on WS-353 test set using PMI and LLR with different number of counters of CU sketch built using Gigaword data-set. [sent-301, score-1.068]
</p><p>84 2 Varying sketch size We evaluate efficient distributional similarity between between word pairs on WS-353 test set using PMI and LLR association scores on Gigaword (9. [sent-304, score-0.786]
</p><p>85 We compare different sizes of CU  sketch (similar to SO evaluation): 50 million (50M), 100M, 200M, 500M, 1 billion (1B) and 2 billion (2B) counters with the Exact word pair counts. [sent-306, score-1.219]
</p><p>86 Here again, computing the exact counts of all wordcontext pairs on these corpora is time, and memory intensive, we generate context vectors for only those words which are present in the test set. [sent-307, score-0.321]
</p><p>87 First, if we look at word pair ranking using exact PMI and LLR across Figures 4(a) and 4(b) respectively, it shows that using LLR, we get better ρ of . [sent-308, score-0.17]
</p><p>88 0n8k) context pairs awtiiotnh l foowr frequency counts higher (Church and Hanks, 1989) compared to frequent ones which are favored by LLR. [sent-313, score-0.217]
</p><p>89 4(b), having more number of counters improve performance and using 2B counters, we get ρ close to the Exact. [sent-326, score-0.445]
</p><p>90 3 Effect of Increasing Corpus Size We evaluate efficient distributional similarity between word pairs using three different sized corpora: GW (9. [sent-329, score-0.253]
</p><p>91 Second, we will fix number of counters to 2B (CU2B) as it performs the best in Section 4. [sent-333, score-0.407]
</p><p>92 Hence, here again it shows that using counters less than the stream length does not degrade the performance. [sent-350, score-0.537]
</p><p>93 Finally we report variants of our approach using association scores computed on the GWB50 using CU sketch with 2 billion counters. [sent-404, score-0.644]
</p><p>94 6  Discussion and Conclusion  The advantage of using sketch in addition to being memory and time efficient is that it contains counts for all word pairs and hence can be used to com-  259 pute association scores like PMI and LLR between any word pairs. [sent-413, score-0.918]
</p><p>95 We show that using sketch counts in our experiments, on the three tasks, we get performance comparable to Exact word pair counts setting and state-of-the-art system. [sent-414, score-0.921]
</p><p>96 Our method scales to 49 GB of unzipped web data using bounded space of 2 billion counters (8 GB memory). [sent-415, score-0.583]
</p><p>97 Moreover, the linearity property of the sketch makes it scalable and usable in distributed setting. [sent-416, score-0.599]
</p><p>98 Association scores and counts from sketch can be used for more NLP tasks like small-space randomized language models, word sense disambiguation, spelling correction, relation learning, paraphrasing, and machine translation. [sent-417, score-0.76]

<p>Author: Tong Wang ; Graeme Hirst</p><p>Abstract: We re-investigate the rationale for and the effectiveness of adopting the notions of depth and density in WordNet-based semantic similarity measures. We show that the intuition for including these notions in WordNet-based similarity measures does not always stand up to empirical examination. In particular, the traditional definitions of depth and density as ordinal integer values in the hierarchical structure of WordNet does not always correlate with human judgment of lexical semantic similarity, which imposes strong limitations on their contribution to an accurate similarity measure. We thus propose several novel definitions of depth and density, which yield significant improvement in degree of correlation with similarity. When used in WordNet-based semantic similarity measures, the new definitions consistently improve performance on a task of correlating with human judgment.</p><p>3 0.053621672 <a title="19-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Identification_of_Multi-word_Expressions_by_Combining_Multiple_Linguistic_Information_Sources.html">69 emnlp-2011-Identification of Multi-word Expressions by Combining Multiple Linguistic Information Sources</a></p>
<p>Author: Yulia Tsvetkov ; Shuly Wintner</p><p>Abstract: We propose an architecture for expressing various linguistically-motivated features that help identify multi-word expressions in natural language texts. The architecture combines various linguistically-motivated classification features in a Bayesian Network. We introduce novel ways for computing many of these features, and manually define linguistically-motivated interrelationships among them, which the Bayesian network models. Our methodology is almost entirely unsupervised and completely languageindependent; it relies on few language resources and is thus suitable for a large number of languages. Furthermore, unlike much recent work, our approach can identify expressions of various types and syntactic con- structions. We demonstrate a significant improvement in identification accuracy, compared with less sophisticated baselines.</p><p>4 0.053109761 <a title="19-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Lexical_Co-occurrence%2C_Statistical_Significance%2C_and_Word_Association.html">86 emnlp-2011-Lexical Co-occurrence, Statistical Significance, and Word Association</a></p>

The resulting models capture the effects of context on the interpretation of a word and in particular its effect on the appropriateness of replacing that word with a potentially related one. Evaluating our techniques on two datasets, we report performance above the prior state of the art for estimating sentence similarity and ranking lexical substitutes.</p><p>6 0.043623634 <a title="19-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Soft_Dependency_Constraints_for_Reordering_in_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation.html">123 emnlp-2011-Soft Dependency Constraints for Reordering in Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation</a></p>

These methods use hashing to deal with massive amounts of streaming text. We apply CountMin sketch to approximate word pair counts and exhibit their effectiveness on three important NLP tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that on all of the three tasks, we get performance comparable to Exact word pair counts setting and state-of-the-art system.

<p>Author: Tong Wang ; Graeme Hirst</p><p>Abstract: We re-investigate the rationale for and the effectiveness of adopting the notions of depth and density in WordNet-based semantic similarity measures. We show that the intuition for including these notions in WordNet-based similarity measures does not always stand up to empirical examination. In particular, the traditional definitions of depth and density as ordinal integer values in the hierarchical structure of WordNet does not always correlate with human judgment of lexical semantic similarity, which imposes strong limitations on their contribution to an accurate similarity measure. We thus propose several novel definitions of depth and density, which yield significant improvement in degree of correlation with similarity. When used in WordNet-based semantic similarity measures, the new definitions consistently improve performance on a task of correlating with human judgment.</p><p>3 0.50405318 <a title="19-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Lexical_Co-occurrence%2C_Statistical_Significance%2C_and_Word_Association.html">86 emnlp-2011-Lexical Co-occurrence, Statistical Significance, and Word Association</a></p>

<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Raghavendra Udupa ; Hal Daume III ; Abhijit Bhole</p><p>Abstract: Mapping documents into an interlingual representation can help bridge the language barrier of cross-lingual corpora. Many existing approaches are based on word co-occurrences extracted from aligned training data, represented as a covariance matrix. In theory, such a covariance matrix should represent semantic equivalence, and should be highly sparse. Unfortunately, the presence of noise leads to dense covariance matrices which in turn leads to suboptimal document representations. In this paper, we explore techniques to recover the desired sparsity in covariance matrices in two ways. First, we explore word association measures and bilingual dictionaries to weigh the word pairs. Later, we explore different selection strategies to remove the noisy pairs based on the association scores. Our experimental results on the task of aligning comparable documents shows the efficacy of sparse covariance matrices on two data sets from two different language pairs.</p><p>6 0.34681886 <a title="19-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Literal_and_Metaphorical_Sense_Identification_through_Concrete_and_Abstract_Context.html">91 emnlp-2011-Literal and Metaphorical Sense Identification through Concrete and Abstract Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to entity linking based on a statistical language model-based information retrieval with query expansion. We use both local contexts and global world knowledge to expand query language models. We place a strong emphasis on named entities in the local contexts and explore a positional language model to weigh them differently based on their distances to the query. Our experiments on the TAC-KBP 2010 data show that incorporating such contextual information indeed aids in disambiguating the named entities and consistently improves the entity linking performance. Compared with the official results from KBP 2010 participants, our system shows competitive performance.</p><p>5 0.87384629 <a title="19-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Parser_Evaluation_over_Local_and_Non-Local_Deep_Dependencies_in_a_Large_Corpus.html">103 emnlp-2011-Parser Evaluation over Local and Non-Local Deep Dependencies in a Large Corpus</a></p>

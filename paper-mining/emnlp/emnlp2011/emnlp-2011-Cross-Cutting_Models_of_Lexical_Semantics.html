<p>Author: David Mimno ; Hanna Wallach ; Edmund Talley ; Miriam Leenders ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable models have the potential to add value to large document collections by discovering interpretable, low-dimensional subspaces. In order for people to use such models, however, they must trust them. Unfortunately, typical dimensionality reduction methods for text, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, often produce low-dimensional subspaces (topics) that are obviously flawed to human domain experts. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) An analysis of the ways in which topics can be flawed; (2) an automated evaluation metric for identifying such topics that does not rely on human annotators or reference collections outside the training data; (3) a novel statistical topic model based on this metric that significantly improves topic quality in a large-scale document collection from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p><p>3 0.13365868 <a title="37-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Exploring_Supervised_LDA_Models_for_Assigning_Attributes_to_Adjective-Noun_Phrases.html">56 emnlp-2011-Exploring Supervised LDA Models for Assigning Attributes to Adjective-Noun Phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Hartung ; Anette Frank</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an attribute selection task as a way to characterize the inherent meaning of property-denoting adjectives in adjective-noun phrases, such as e.g. hot in hot summer denoting the attribute TEMPERATURE, rather than TASTE. We formulate this task in a vector space model that represents adjectives and nouns as vectors in a semantic space defined over possible attributes. The vectors incorporate latent semantic information obtained from two variants of LDA topic models. Our LDA models outperform previous approaches on a small set of 10 attributes with considerable gains on sparse representations, which highlights the strong smoothing power of LDA models. For the first time, we extend the attribute selection task to a new data set with more than 200 classes. We observe that large-scale attribute selection is a hard problem, but a subset of attributes performs robustly on the large scale as well. Again, the LDA models outperform the VSM baseline.</p><p>4 0.098620825 <a title="37-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Semantic_Topic_Models%3A_Combining_Word_Distributional_Statistics_and_Dictionary_Definitions.html">119 emnlp-2011-Semantic Topic Models: Combining Word Distributional Statistics and Dictionary Definitions</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel topic model based on incorporating dictionary definitions. Traditional topic models treat words as surface strings without assuming predefined knowledge about word meaning. They infer topics only by observing surface word co-occurrence. However, the co-occurred words may not be semantically related in a manner that is relevant for topic coherence. Exploiting dictionary definitions explicitly in our model yields a better understanding of word semantics leading to better text modeling. We exploit WordNet as a lexical resource for sense definitions. We show that explicitly modeling word definitions helps improve performance significantly over the baseline for a text categorization task.</p><p>5 0.092029616 <a title="37-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_generative_model_for_unsupervised_discovery_of_relations_and_argument_classes_from_clinical_texts.html">14 emnlp-2011-A generative model for unsupervised discovery of relations and argument classes from clinical texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Bryan Rink ; Sanda Harabagiu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a generative model for the automatic discovery of relations between entities in electronic medical records. The model discovers relation instances and their types by determining which context tokens express the relation. Additionally, the valid semantic classes for each type of relation are determined. We show that the model produces clusters of relation trigger words which better correspond with manually annotated relations than several existing clustering techniques. The discovered relations reveal some of the implicit semantic structure present in patient records.</p><p>6 0.079066843 <a title="37-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Bayesian_Checking_for_Topic_Models.html">21 emnlp-2011-Bayesian Checking for Topic Models</a></p>

<p>Author: David Mimno ; David Blei</p><p>Abstract: Real document collections do not fit the independence assumptions asserted by most statistical topic models, but how badly do they violate them? We present a Bayesian method for measuring how well a topic model fits a corpus. Our approach is based on posterior predictive checking, a method for diagnosing Bayesian models in user-defined ways. Our method can identify where a topic model fits the data, where it falls short, and in which directions it might be improved.</p><p>4 0.5240652 <a title="37-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Exploring_Supervised_LDA_Models_for_Assigning_Attributes_to_Adjective-Noun_Phrases.html">56 emnlp-2011-Exploring Supervised LDA Models for Assigning Attributes to Adjective-Noun Phrases</a></p>

<p>Author: Prodromos Malakasiotis ; Ion Androutsopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present a method that paraphrases a given sentence by first generating candidate paraphrases and then ranking (or classifying) them. The candidates are generated by applying existing paraphrasing rules extracted from parallel corpora. The ranking component considers not only the overall quality of the rules that produced each candidate, but also the extent to which they preserve grammaticality and meaning in the particular context of the input sentence, as well as the degree to which the candidate differs from the input. We experimented with both a Maximum Entropy classifier and an SVR ranker. Experimental results show that incorporating features from an existing paraphrase recognizer in the ranking component improves performance, and that our overall method compares well against a state of the art paraphrase generator, when paraphrasing rules apply to the input sentences. We also propose a new methodology to evaluate the ranking components of generate-and-rank paraphrase generators, which evaluates them across different combinations of weights for grammaticality, meaning preservation, and diversity. The paper is accompanied by a paraphrasing dataset we constructed for evaluations of this kind.</p><p>3 0.63028598 <a title="37-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Closing_the_Loop%3A_Fast%2C_Interactive_Semi-Supervised_Annotation_With_Queries_on_Features_and_Instances.html">28 emnlp-2011-Closing the Loop: Fast, Interactive Semi-Supervised Annotation With Queries on Features and Instances</a></p>

We present a novel semi-supervised training algorithm developed for this setting, which is (1) fast enough to support real-time interactive speeds, and (2) at least as accurate as preexisting methods for learning with mixed feature and instance labels. Human annotators in user studies were able to produce near-stateof-the-art classifiers—on several corpora in a variety of application domains—with only a few minutes of effort.</p><p>4 0.62958974 <a title="37-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Generating_Subsequent_Reference_in_Shared_Visual_Scenes%3A_Computation_vs_Re-Use.html">62 emnlp-2011-Generating Subsequent Reference in Shared Visual Scenes: Computation vs Re-Use</a></p>
<p>Author: Jette Viethen ; Robert Dale ; Markus Guhe</p><p>Abstract: Traditional computational approaches to referring expression generation operate in a deliberate manner, choosing the attributes to be included on the basis of their ability to distinguish the intended referent from its distractors. However, work in psycholinguistics suggests that speakers align their referring expressions with those used previously in the discourse, implying less deliberate choice and more subconscious reuse. This raises the question as to which is a more accurate characterisation of what people do. Using a corpus of dialogues containing 16,358 referring expressions, we explore this question via the generation of subsequent references in shared visual scenes. We use a machine learning approach to referring expression generation and demonstrate that incorporating features that correspond to the computational tradition does not match human referring behaviour as well as using features corresponding to the process of alignment. The results support the view that the traditional model of referring expression generation that is widely assumed in work on natural language generation may not in fact be correct; our analysis may also help explain the oft-observed redundancy found in humanproduced referring expressions.</p><p>5 0.62931103 <a title="37-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous_Phrase_Dependency_Grammars_for_Machine_Translation.html">108 emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous Phrase Dependency Grammars for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Gimpel ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We present a quasi-synchronous dependency grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006) for machine translation in which the leaves of the tree are phrases rather than words as in previous work (Gimpel and Smith, 2009). This formulation allows us to combine structural components of phrase-based and syntax-based MT in a single model. We describe a method of extracting phrase dependencies from parallel text using a target-side dependency parser. For decoding, we describe a coarse-to-fine approach based on lattice dependency parsing of phrase lattices. We demonstrate performance improvements for Chinese-English and UrduEnglish translation over a phrase-based baseline. We also investigate the use of unsupervised dependency parsers, reporting encouraging preliminary results.</p><p>6 0.62892395 <a title="37-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Enhancing_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_Using_Unlabeled_Data.html">48 emnlp-2011-Enhancing Chinese Word Segmentation Using Unlabeled Data</a></p>

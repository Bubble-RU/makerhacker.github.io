<p>Author: Keith Hall ; Ryan McDonald ; Jason Katz-Brown ; Michael Ringgaard</p><p>Abstract: We present an online learning algorithm for training parsers which allows for the inclusion of multiple objective functions. The primary example is the extension of a standard supervised parsing objective function with additional loss-functions, either based on intrinsic parsing quality or task-specific extrinsic measures of quality. Our empirical results show how this approach performs for two dependency parsing algorithms (graph-based and transition-based parsing) and how it achieves increased performance on multiple target tasks including reordering for machine translation and parser adaptation.</p><p>3 0.11166426 <a title="129-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Lexical_Generalization_in_CCG_Grammar_Induction_for_Semantic_Parsing.html">87 emnlp-2011-Lexical Generalization in CCG Grammar Induction for Semantic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning factored probabilistic CCG grammars for semantic parsing from data containing sentences paired with logical-form meaning representations. Traditional CCG lexicons list lexical items that pair words and phrases with syntactic and semantic content. Such lexicons can be inefficient when words appear repeatedly with closely related lexical content. In this paper, we introduce factored lexicons, which include both lexemes to model word meaning and templates to model systematic variation in word usage. We also present an algorithm for learning factored CCG lexicons, along with a probabilistic parse-selection model. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach learns highly accurate parsers, whose generalization performance greatly from the lexical factoring. benefits</p><p>4 0.11094834 <a title="129-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Multilayer_Sequence_Labeling.html">96 emnlp-2011-Multilayer Sequence Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Ai Azuma ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we describe a novel approach to cascaded learning and inference on sequences. We propose a weakly joint learning model on cascaded inference on sequences, called multilayer sequence labeling. In this model, inference on sequences is modeled as cascaded decision. However, the decision on a sequence labeling sequel to other decisions utilizes the features on the preceding results as marginalized by the probabilistic models on them. It is not novel itself, but our idea central to this paper is that the probabilistic models on succeeding labeling are viewed as indirectly depending on the probabilistic models on preceding analyses. We also propose two types of efficient dynamic programming which are required in the gradient-based optimization of an objective function. One of the dynamic programming algorithms resembles back propagation algorithm for mul- tilayer feed-forward neural networks. The other is a generalized version of the forwardbackward algorithm. We also report experiments of cascaded part-of-speech tagging and chunking of English sentences and show effectiveness of the proposed method.</p><p>5 0.097517796 <a title="129-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Structure_Prediction_with_Non-Parallel_Multilingual_Guidance.html">146 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Structure Prediction with Non-Parallel Multilingual Guidance</a></p>
<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen ; Dipanjan Das ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method for prediction of linguistic structure in a language for which only unlabeled data is available, using annotated data from a set of one or more helper languages. Our approach is based on a model that locally mixes between supervised models from the helper languages. Parallel data is not used, allowing the technique to be applied even in domains where human-translated texts are unavailable. We obtain state-of-theart performance for two tasks of structure prediction: unsupervised part-of-speech tagging and unsupervised dependency parsing.</p><p>6 0.096509188 <a title="129-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Dual_Decomposition_with_Many_Overlapping_Components.html">45 emnlp-2011-Dual Decomposition with Many Overlapping Components</a></p>

<p>Author: Cane Wing-ki Leung ; Jing Jiang ; Kian Ming A.

Our approach clusters candidate slot fillers to identify meaningful template slots. We propose a generative model that incorporates distributional prior knowledge to help distribute candidates in a document into appropriate slots. Empirical results suggest that the proposed prior can bring substantial improvements to our task as compared to a K-means baseline and a Gaussian mixture model baseline. Specifically, the proposed prior has shown to be effective when coupled with discriminative features of the candidates.</p><p>5 0.43844917 <a title="129-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Minimum_Imputed-Risk%3A_Unsupervised_Discriminative_Training_for_Machine_Translation.html">93 emnlp-2011-Minimum Imputed-Risk: Unsupervised Discriminative Training for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhifei Li ; Ziyuan Wang ; Jason Eisner ; Sanjeev Khudanpur ; Brian Roark</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative training for machine translation has been well studied in the recent past. A limitation of the work to date is that it relies on the availability of high-quality in-domain bilingual text for supervised training. We present an unsupervised discriminative training framework to incorporate the usually plentiful target-language monolingual data by using a rough “reverse” translation system. Intuitively, our method strives to ensure that probabilistic “round-trip” translation from a target- language sentence to the source-language and back will have low expected loss. Theoretically, this may be justified as (discriminatively) minimizing an imputed empirical risk. Empirically, we demonstrate that augmenting supervised training with unsupervised data improves translation performance over the supervised case for both IWSLT and NIST tasks.</p><p>6 0.41130921 <a title="129-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Efficient_Subsampling_for_Training_Complex_Language_Models.html">46 emnlp-2011-Efficient Subsampling for Training Complex Language Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Andre Martins ; Noah Smith ; Mario Figueiredo ; Pedro Aguiar</p><p>Abstract: Dual decomposition has been recently proposed as a way of combining complementary models, with a boost in predictive power. However, in cases where lightweight decompositions are not readily available (e.g., due to the presence of rich features or logical constraints), the original subgradient algorithm is inefficient. We sidestep that difficulty by adopting an augmented Lagrangian method that accelerates model consensus by regularizing towards the averaged votes. We show how first-order logical constraints can be handled efficiently, even though the corresponding subproblems are no longer combinatorial, and report experiments in dependency parsing, with state-of-the-art results. 1</p><p>4 0.52961153 <a title="129-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_a_Parser_for_Machine_Translation_Reordering.html">136 emnlp-2011-Training a Parser for Machine Translation Reordering</a></p>

We apply our method to train parsers that excel when used as part of a reordering component in a statistical machine translation system. We use a corpus of weakly-labeled reference reorderings to guide parser training.

<p>Author: Jette Viethen ; Robert Dale ; Markus Guhe</p><p>Abstract: Traditional computational approaches to referring expression generation operate in a deliberate manner, choosing the attributes to be included on the basis of their ability to distinguish the intended referent from its distractors. However, work in psycholinguistics suggests that speakers align their referring expressions with those used previously in the discourse, implying less deliberate choice and more subconscious reuse. This raises the question as to which is a more accurate characterisation of what people do. Using a corpus of dialogues containing 16,358 referring expressions, we explore this question via the generation of subsequent references in shared visual scenes. We use a machine learning approach to referring expression generation and demonstrate that incorporating features that correspond to the computational tradition does not match human referring behaviour as well as using features corresponding to the process of alignment. The results support the view that the traditional model of referring expression generation that is widely assumed in work on natural language generation may not in fact be correct; our analysis may also help explain the oft-observed redundancy found in humanproduced referring expressions.</p><p>6 0.52897149 <a title="129-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Corpus-Guided_Sentence_Generation_of_Natural_Images.html">34 emnlp-2011-Corpus-Guided Sentence Generation of Natural Images</a></p>

</p><p>2 We fill this gap by adopting regularizers that promote structured sparsity, along with efficient algorithms to handle them. [sent-18, score-0.417]
</p><p>3 Our focus is on methods which embed this selection into the learning problem via the regularization term. [sent-30, score-0.238]
</p><p>4 For example, we want to be able to select entire feature templates (rather than features individually), or to make the inclusion of some features depend on the inclusion of other features. [sent-32, score-0.321]
</p><p>5 We achieve the goal stated above by employing regularizers which promote structured sparsity. [sent-33, score-0.417]
</p><p>6 Such regularizers are able to encode prior knowledge and guide the selection of features by modeling the structure of the feature space. [sent-34, score-0.37]
</p><p>7 Lately, this type of regularizers has received a lot of attention in computer vision, signal processing, and computational biology (Zhao et al. [sent-35, score-0.219]

</p><p>10 Neither of the regularizers just described “looks” at the structure of the feature space, since they all treat each dimension independently—we call them unstructured regularizers, as opposed to the structured ones that we next describe. [sent-83, score-0.399]
</p><p>11 3 Structured Sparsity We are interested in regularizers that share with ΩτL1 the ability to promote sparsity, so that they can be used for selecting features. [sent-84, score-0.289]
</p><p>12 In addition, we want to endow the feature space RD with additional structure, so that features are not penalized individually (as in the L1-case) but collectively, encouraging en-  tire groups of features to be discarded. [sent-85, score-0.383]
</p><p>13 The choice of groups will allow encoding prior knowledge regarding the kind of sparsity patterns that are intended in the model. [sent-86, score-0.358]
</p><p>14 1 The Group Lasso To capture the structure of the feature space, we group our D features into M groups G1, . [sent-89, score-0.543]
</p><p>15 Ahead, we discuss meaningful ways 1of, choosing group decompositions; for now, let us assume a sensible choice is obvious to the model designer. [sent-96, score-0.204]
</p><p>16 (8)  These regularizers wPere first proposed by Bakin (1999) and Yuan and Lin (2006) in the context of regression. [sent-102, score-0.219]
</p><p>17 1 These regularizers subsume the L1 and L2 cases, which corre-  spond to trivial choices of groups: •  •  If each group is a singleton, i. [sent-108, score-0.423]
</p><p>18 Let us first consider the case where G is a partition of the feature space: the groups cover all the features (Sm Gm = {1, . [sent-129, score-0.339]
</p><p>19 It encourages sparsity patterns in which entire groups are discarded. [sent-134, score-0.358]
</p><p>20 A judicious choice of groups can lead to very compact  =  1In the statistics literature, such mixed-norm regularizers, which group features and then apply a separate norm for each group, are called composite absolute penalties (Zhao et al. [sent-135, score-0.569]
</p><p>21 However it can be shown that both regularizers lead to identical learning problems (Eq. [sent-143, score-0.219]
</p><p>22 In this case, all groups have the same size and we typically set d1 = . [sent-155, score-0.243]
</p><p>23 In §5, we learn feature templates from the data, by associating ne faecaht group tpol a fsea ftruomre template, and letting that group contain all features that are instantiations of this template. [sent-164, score-0.685]
</p><p>24 Since groups have different sizes, it is a good idea to let dm increase with the group size, so that larger groups pay a larger penalty for being included. [sent-165, score-0.801]
</p><p>25 More generally, we may let the groups in G overlap but be nested, i. [sent-167, score-0.243]
</p><p>26 , we may want them to form a hierarchy (two distinct groups either have empty intersection or one is contained in the other). [sent-169, score-0.243]
</p><p>27 d Eraawchn gfrroomup group Ga to group Gb if Gb ⊂ Ga and there is no b0 s. [sent-173, score-0.408]
</p><p>28 W⊂hen Gthe groups are nested, this  diagram is a forest (a union of directed trees). [sent-176, score-0.316]
</p><p>29 The corresponding regularizer enforces sparsity patterns 3The same idea is also used in multitask learning, where labels correspond to tasks (Caruana, 1997). [sent-177, score-0.26]
</p><p>30 where a group of features is only selected if all its ancestors are also selected. [sent-178, score-0.248]
</p><p>31 (2010):  ΩSdG,τL(θ) = PMm=01 (dmkθmk2 + τmkθmk1)  ,  (9)  where the totalP number of groups is M = M0 + D, and the components θ1 , . [sent-189, score-0.243]
</p><p>32 This regularizer promotes sparsity at both group and feature levels (i. [sent-193, score-0.516]
</p><p>33 , it eliminates entire groups and sparsifies within each group). [sent-195, score-0.243]
</p><p>34 In general, the groups in G may overlap without being nested. [sent-197, score-0.243]
</p><p>35 As in the tree-structured case, a group of  features is only selected if all its ancestors are also selected. [sent-199, score-0.248]
</p><p>36 (2009) suggested a way of reverse engineering the groups from the desired sparsity pattern. [sent-201, score-0.358]
</p><p>37 We next describe a strategy for coarse-to-fine feature template selection that directly builds on that idea. [sent-202, score-0.235]
</p><p>38 Suppose that we are given M feature templates T = {T1, . [sent-203, score-0.233]
</p><p>39 thie same shape; 4We say that a group of features Gm is selected if some fea-  ture  in Gm (but  not  necessarily all) has  a nonzero  weight. [sent-231, score-0.32]
</p><p>40 The result is a “coarse-to-fine” regularizer, which prefers to select feature templates that are coarser before zooming into finer features. [sent-234, score-0.233]
</p><p>41 This reflects th∼e f Nact( 0t,haτt some groups should have their feature weights shrunk more towards zero than others. [sent-250, score-0.295]
</p><p>42 Digits below each node are the group [iTndices where  each template belongs. [sent-269, score-0.332]
</p><p>43 (13)  For the non-overlapping group Lasso case, the proximity operator is given by  [proxΩdGL(θ)]m=( 0kθkmθkm2−k2dmθm ioft hkθermwkis2e. [sent-274, score-0.282]
</p><p>44 13: if the L2-norm of the m-th group is less than dm, the entire group is discarded; otherwise it is scaled so that its L2-norm decreases by an amount of dm. [sent-276, score-0.408]
</p><p>45 When groups overlap, the proximity operator lacks a closed form. [sent-277, score-0.321]

</p><p>47 , GJ such that Gj = MG an dids jtohien groups on each Gj are nonoSverlapping. [sent-307, score-0.243]
</p><p>48 The proximal steps are then applied sequentially, one per each Ωj. [sent-308, score-0.299]
</p><p>49 Each proximal step is lin-  ear in the number of groups M, and does not need be to performed every round (as we will see later). [sent-313, score-0.502]
</p><p>50 Entire groups of features can be deleted after each proximal step. [sent-317, score-0.546]
</p><p>51 Furthermore, only the features which correspond to nonzero entries in the gradient vector need to be inserted in the active set; for some losses (LSVM and LSP) many irrelevant features are never instantianted. [sent-318, score-0.254]
</p><p>52 (2009) and set hσjtijJ=1 to zero for all t wfohrdich e ti sa not a multiple oeft some prespecified integer K; this way, proximal steps need only be performed each K rounds, yielding a significant speed-up when the number of groups M is large. [sent-335, score-0.542]
</p><p>53 (2009) would set σjt = Kσj for those rounds; however, we have observed that such a strategy makes the number of groups vary substantially in early epochs. [sent-337, score-0.243]
</p><p>54 We use a different strategy: for each Gj, we specify a budget of Bj ≥ 0 groups (this may take into consideration practical limitations, siusc mh as ttahek ea ivnaitloa bcolen memory). [sent-338, score-0.321]
</p><p>55 Otherwise, sort the groups in Gj by decreasing order of their L2-norms. [sent-343, score-0.243]
</p><p>56 At the end of this step, no more than Bj groups will remain nonzero. [sent-348, score-0.243]
</p><p>57 6 Hence, we have shifted the control of Pthe amount of regularization to the budget constants Bj, which unlike the σj have a clear meaning and can be chosen under practical considerations. [sent-350, score-0.261]

</p><p>63 The number of actually selected groups may be less than B, however, since in this case some groups can be shrunk more than once. [sent-378, score-0.486]
</p><p>64 T×hiRs representation allows performing the two operations above in constant time, and it keeps track of the group L2-norms, necessary in the proximal updates. [sent-382, score-0.463]
</p><p>65 Only features that, at some point, intervene in the gradient computed in line 5 need to be instantiated; and all features that receive zero weights after some proximal step can be deleted from the model (cf. [sent-384, score-0.441]
</p><p>66 1 allows to simultaneously select features and learn the model parameters, it has been observed in the sparse modeling literature that Lasso-like regularizers usually have a strong bias which may harm predictive performance. [sent-389, score-0.357]
</p><p>67 A post-processing stage is usually taken (called debiasing), in which the model is refitted without any regularization and using only the selected features (Wright et al. [sent-390, score-0.227]

</p><p>72 We defined unigram features by conjoining these templates with each of the 22 output labels. [sent-418, score-0.225]
</p><p>73 An additional template was defined to account for label bigrams—features in this template do not look at the input string, but only at consecutive pairs of labels. [sent-419, score-0.256]
</p><p>74 8 We evaluate the ability of group-Lasso regularization to perform feature template selection. [sent-420, score-0.363]
</p><p>75 To do that, we ran 5 epochs of the sparseptron algorithm with template-based groups and budget-driven shrinkage (budgets of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 templates were tried). [sent-421, score-0.725]

</p><p>78 The oscillation in the first 5 epochs (bottom line) comes from the proximal steps each K = 1000 rounds. [sent-455, score-0.371]
</p><p>79 We do feature template selection (same setting as before) for budget sizes of 100, 200, and 300. [sent-479, score-0.313]
</p><p>80 We compare with both MIRA (using all the features) and the sparseptron with a standard Lasso regularizer ΩτL1 , for several values of C = 1/(τN). [sent-480, score-0.305]
</p><p>81 Note also that the ability to discard feature templates (rather than individual features) yields faster test runtime than models regularized with the standard Lasso: fewer templates will need to be instantiated, with a speed-up in score computation. [sent-483, score-0.449]

</p><p>84 We defined M = 684 feature templates for each candidate arc by conjoining the words, shapes, lemmas, and POS of the head and the modifier, as well as the contextual POS, and the distance and direction of attachment. [sent-501, score-0.233]
</p><p>85 We followed the same two-stage use  approach as before, and compared with a baseline which selects feature templates by ranking them according to the information gain criterion. [sent-502, score-0.233]
</p><p>86 We observe that for all but one language (Spanish is the exception), nonoverlapping group-Lasso regularization is more effective at selecting feature templates than the information gain criterion, and slightly better than coarse-to-fine group-Lasso. [sent-507, score-0.416]

<p>Author: Andre Martins ; Noah Smith ; Mario Figueiredo ; Pedro Aguiar</p><p>Abstract: Dual decomposition has been recently proposed as a way of combining complementary models, with a boost in predictive power. However, in cases where lightweight decompositions are not readily available (e.g., due to the presence of rich features or logical constraints), the original subgradient algorithm is inefficient. We sidestep that difficulty by adopting an augmented Lagrangian method that accelerates model consensus by regularizing towards the averaged votes. We show how first-order logical constraints can be handled efficiently, even though the corresponding subproblems are no longer combinatorial, and report experiments in dependency parsing, with state-of-the-art results. 1</p><p>3 0.11024031 <a title="129-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_dependency_parsers_by_jointly_optimizing_multiple_objectives.html">137 emnlp-2011-Training dependency parsers by jointly optimizing multiple objectives</a></p>

We propose a weakly joint learning model on cascaded inference on sequences, called multilayer sequence labeling. In this model, inference on sequences is modeled as cascaded decision. However, the decision on a sequence labeling sequel to other decisions utilizes the features on the preceding results as marginalized by the probabilistic models on them. It is not novel itself, but our idea central to this paper is that the probabilistic models on succeeding labeling are viewed as indirectly depending on the probabilistic models on preceding analyses. We also propose two types of efficient dynamic programming which are required in the gradient-based optimization of an objective function. One of the dynamic programming algorithms resembles back propagation algorithm for mul- tilayer feed-forward neural networks. The other is a generalized version of the forwardbackward algorithm. We also report experiments of cascaded part-of-speech tagging and chunking of English sentences and show effectiveness of the proposed method.</p><p>5 0.09105207 <a title="129-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Lexical_Generalization_in_CCG_Grammar_Induction_for_Semantic_Parsing.html">87 emnlp-2011-Lexical Generalization in CCG Grammar Induction for Semantic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning factored probabilistic CCG grammars for semantic parsing from data containing sentences paired with logical-form meaning representations. Traditional CCG lexicons list lexical items that pair words and phrases with syntactic and semantic content. Such lexicons can be inefficient when words appear repeatedly with closely related lexical content. In this paper, we introduce factored lexicons, which include both lexemes to model word meaning and templates to model systematic variation in word usage. We also present an algorithm for learning factored CCG lexicons, along with a probabilistic parse-selection model. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach learns highly accurate parsers, whose generalization performance greatly from the lexical factoring. benefits</p><p>6 0.081720822 <a title="129-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Predicting_a_Scientific_Communitys_Response_to_an_Article.html">106 emnlp-2011-Predicting a Scientific Communitys Response to an Article</a></p>

<p>Author: Puyang Xu ; Asela Gunawardana ; Sanjeev Khudanpur</p><p>Abstract: We propose an efficient way to train maximum entropy language models (MELM) and neural network language models (NNLM). The advantage of the proposed method comes from a more robust and efficient subsampling technique. The original multi-class language modeling problem is transformed into a set of binary problems where each binary classifier predicts whether or not a particular word will occur. We show that the binarized model is as powerful as the standard model and allows us to aggressively subsample negative training examples without sacrificing predictive performance. Empirical results show that we can train MELM and NNLM at 1% ∼ 5% of the strtaaninda MrdE complexity LwMith a no %los ∼s 5in% performance.</p><p>5 0.43861842 <a title="129-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Dual_Decomposition_with_Many_Overlapping_Components.html">45 emnlp-2011-Dual Decomposition with Many Overlapping Components</a></p>
<p>Author: Andre Martins ; Noah Smith ; Mario Figueiredo ; Pedro Aguiar</p><p>Abstract: Dual decomposition has been recently proposed as a way of combining complementary models, with a boost in predictive power. However, in cases where lightweight decompositions are not readily available (e.g., due to the presence of rich features or logical constraints), the original subgradient algorithm is inefficient. We sidestep that difficulty by adopting an augmented Lagrangian method that accelerates model consensus by regularizing towards the averaged votes. We show how first-order logical constraints can be handled efficiently, even though the corresponding subproblems are no longer combinatorial, and report experiments in dependency parsing, with state-of-the-art results. 1</p><p>6 0.41986373 <a title="129-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Computing_Logical_Form_on_Regulatory_Texts.html">32 emnlp-2011-Computing Logical Form on Regulatory Texts</a></p>

The representation choice is shown to determine the form and complexity of target LM intersection and shortest-path algorithms that follow. Intersection, shortest path, FSA expansion and RTN replacement algorithms are presented for PDAs. Chinese-toEnglish translation experiments using HiFST and HiPDT, FSA and PDA-based decoders, are presented using admissible (or exact) search, possible for HiFST with compact SCFG rulesets and HiPDT with compact LMs. For large rulesets with large LMs, we introduce a two-pass search strategy which we then analyze in terms of search errors and translation performance.</p><p>5 0.36133918 <a title="129-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Information_Extraction_with_Distributional_Prior_Knowledge.html">143 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Information Extraction with Distributional Prior Knowledge</a></p>

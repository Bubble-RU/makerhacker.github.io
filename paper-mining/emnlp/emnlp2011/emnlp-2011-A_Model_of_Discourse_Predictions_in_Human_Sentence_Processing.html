<p>Author: Amal Al-Saif ; Katja Markert</p><p>Abstract: We present the first algorithms to automatically identify explicit discourse connectives and the relations they signal for Arabic text. First we show that, for Arabic news, most adjacent sentences are connected via explicit connectives in contrast to English, making the treatment of explicit discourse connectives for Arabic highly important. We also show that explicit Arabic discourse connectives are far more ambiguous than English ones, making their treatment challenging. In the second part of the paper, we present supervised algorithms to address automatic discourse connective identification and discourse relation recognition. Our connective identifier based on gold standard syntactic features achieves almost human performance. In addition, an identifier based solely on simple lexical and automatically derived morphological and POS features performs with high reliability, essential for languages that do not have high-quality parsers yet. Our algorithm for recognizing discourse relations performs significantly better than a baseline based on the connective surface string alone and therefore reduces the ambiguity in explicit connective interpretation.</p><p>3 0.16754274 <a title="8-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Discourse_Relations_for_Eliminating_Intra-sentence_Polarity_Ambiguities.html">142 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Discovery of Discourse Relations for Eliminating Intra-sentence Polarity Ambiguities</a></p>
<p>Author: Lanjun Zhou ; Binyang Li ; Wei Gao ; Zhongyu Wei ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of opinionated sentences with both positive and negative sentiments1 is a key challenge in sentiment analysis. This paper presents a novel unsupervised method for discovering intra-sentence level discourse relations for eliminating polarity ambiguities. Firstly, a discourse scheme with discourse constraints on polarity was defined empirically based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, a small set of cuephrase-based patterns were utilized to collect a large number of discourse instances which were later converted to semantic sequential representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsupervised method was adopted to generate, weigh and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for recognizing discourse relations. Experimental results showed that the proposed methods not only effectively recognized the defined discourse relations but also achieved significant improvement by integrating discourse information in sentence-level polarity classification.</p><p>4 0.14048375 <a title="8-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Learning_the_Information_Status_of_Noun_Phrases_in_Spoken_Dialogues.html">84 emnlp-2011-Learning the Information Status of Noun Phrases in Spoken Dialogues</a></p>
<p>Author: Altaf Rahman ; Vincent Ng</p><p>Abstract: An entity in a dialogue may be old, new, or mediated/inferrable with respect to the hearer’s beliefs. Knowing the information status of the entities participating in a dialogue can therefore facilitate its interpretation. We address the under-investigated problem of automatically determining the information status of discourse entities. Specifically, we extend Nissim’s (2006) machine learning approach to information-status determination with lexical and structured features, and exploit learned knowledge of the information status of each discourse entity for coreference resolution. Experimental results on a set of Switchboard dialogues reveal that (1) incorporating our proposed features into Nissim’s feature set enables our system to achieve stateof-the-art performance on information-status classification, and (2) the resulting information can be used to improve the performance of learning-based coreference resolvers.</p><p>5 0.1322681 <a title="8-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Minimally_Supervised_Event_Causality_Identification.html">92 emnlp-2011-Minimally Supervised Event Causality Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Quang Do ; Yee Seng Chan ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops a minimally supervised approach, based on focused distributional similarity methods and discourse connectives, for identifying of causality relations between events in context. While it has been shown that distributional similarity can help identifying causality, we observe that discourse connectives and the particular discourse relation they evoke in context provide additional information towards determining causality between events. We show that combining discourse relation predictions and distributional similarity methods in a global inference procedure provides additional improvements towards determining event causality.</p><p>6 0.10750224 <a title="8-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Structure_Prediction_with_Non-Parallel_Multilingual_Guidance.html">146 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Structure Prediction with Non-Parallel Multilingual Guidance</a></p>

<p>Author: Anna Kazantseva ; Stan Szpakowicz</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for linear text segmentation. It is an adaptation of Affinity Propagation, a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm in the framework of factor graphs. Affinity Propagation for Segmentation, or APS, receives a set of pairwise similarities between data points and produces segment boundaries and segment centres data points which best describe all other data points within the segment. APS iteratively passes messages in a cyclic factor graph, until convergence. Each iteration works with information on all available similarities, resulting in highquality results. APS scales linearly for realistic segmentation tasks. We derive the algorithm from the original Affinity Propagation formu– lation, and evaluate its performance on topical text segmentation in comparison with two state-of-the art segmenters. The results suggest that APS performs on par with or outperforms these two very competitive baselines.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.70505965 <a title="8-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Model_of_Discourse_Predictions_in_Human_Sentence_Processing.html">8 emnlp-2011-A Model of Discourse Predictions in Human Sentence Processing</a></p>

<p>Author: Yulia Tsvetkov ; Shuly Wintner</p><p>Abstract: We propose an architecture for expressing various linguistically-motivated features that help identify multi-word expressions in natural language texts. The architecture combines various linguistically-motivated classification features in a Bayesian Network. We introduce novel ways for computing many of these features, and manually define linguistically-motivated interrelationships among them, which the Bayesian network models. Our methodology is almost entirely unsupervised and completely languageindependent; it relies on few language resources and is thus suitable for a large number of languages. Furthermore, unlike much recent work, our approach can identify expressions of various types and syntactic con- structions. We demonstrate a significant improvement in identification accuracy, compared with less sophisticated baselines.</p><p>4 0.62272233 <a title="8-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Predicting_Sentiment_Distributions.html">120 emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoders for Predicting Sentiment Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Jeffrey Pennington ; Eric H. Huang ; Andrew Y. Ng ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning framework based on recursive autoencoders for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label distributions. Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the model’s ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures emotional reactions. Our algorithm can more accurately predict distributions over such labels compared to several competitive baselines.</p><p>5 0.48894924 <a title="8-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Non-parametric_Bayesian_Segmentation_of_Japanese_Noun_Phrases.html">99 emnlp-2011-Non-parametric Bayesian Segmentation of Japanese Noun Phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Yugo Murawaki ; Sadao Kurohashi</p><p>Abstract: A key factor of high quality word segmentation for Japanese is a high-coverage dictionary, but it is costly to manually build such a lexical resource. Although external lexical resources for human readers are potentially good knowledge sources, they have not been utilized due to differences in segmentation criteria. To supplement a morphological dictionary with these resources, we propose a new task of Japanese noun phrase segmentation. We apply non-parametric Bayesian language models to segment each noun phrase in these resources according to the statistical behavior of its supposed constituents in text. For inference, we propose a novel block sampling procedure named hybrid type-based sampling, which has the ability to directly escape a local optimum that is not too distant from the global optimum. Experiments show that the proposed method efficiently corrects the initial segmentation given by a morphological ana- lyzer.</p><p>6 0.48371187 <a title="8-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Generating_Subsequent_Reference_in_Shared_Visual_Scenes%3A_Computation_vs_Re-Use.html">62 emnlp-2011-Generating Subsequent Reference in Shared Visual Scenes: Computation vs Re-Use</a></p>

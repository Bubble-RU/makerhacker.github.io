<p>Author: Ashequl Qadir ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: This research studies the text genre of message board forums, which contain a mixture of expository sentences that present factual information and conversational sentences that include communicative acts between the writer and readers. Our goal is to create sentence classifiers that can identify whether a sentence contains a speech act, and can recognize sentences containing four different speech act classes: Commissives, Directives, Expressives, and Representatives. We conduct experiments using a wide variety of features, including lexical and syntactic features, speech act word lists from external resources, and domain-specific semantic class features. We evaluate our results on a collection of message board posts in the domain of veterinary medicine.</p><p>4 0.12996545 <a title="105-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Data-Driven_Response_Generation_in_Social_Media.html">38 emnlp-2011-Data-Driven Response Generation in Social Media</a></p>

We find that mapping conversational stimuli onto responses is more difficult than translating between languages, due to the wider range of possible responses, the larger fraction of unaligned words/phrases, and the presence of large phrase pairs whose alignment cannot be further decomposed. After addressing these challenges, we compare approaches based on SMT and Information Retrieval in a human evaluation. We show that SMT outperforms IR on this task, and its output is preferred over actual human responses in 15% of cases.

<p>Author: Amal Al-Saif ; Katja Markert</p><p>Abstract: We present the first algorithms to automatically identify explicit discourse connectives and the relations they signal for Arabic text. First we show that, for Arabic news, most adjacent sentences are connected via explicit connectives in contrast to English, making the treatment of explicit discourse connectives for Arabic highly important. We also show that explicit Arabic discourse connectives are far more ambiguous than English ones, making their treatment challenging. In the second part of the paper, we present supervised algorithms to address automatic discourse connective identification and discourse relation recognition. Our connective identifier based on gold standard syntactic features achieves almost human performance. In addition, an identifier based solely on simple lexical and automatically derived morphological and POS features performs with high reliability, essential for languages that do not have high-quality parsers yet. Our algorithm for recognizing discourse relations performs significantly better than a baseline based on the connective surface string alone and therefore reduces the ambiguity in explicit connective interpretation.</p><p>6 0.10886111 <a title="105-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Discourse_Relations_for_Eliminating_Intra-sentence_Polarity_Ambiguities.html">142 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Discovery of Discourse Relations for Eliminating Intra-sentence Polarity Ambiguities</a></p>

<p>Author: Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Conversations provide rich opportunities for interactive, continuous learning. When something goes wrong, a system can ask for clarification, rewording, or otherwise redirect the interaction to achieve its goals. In this paper, we present an approach for using conversational interactions of this type to induce semantic parsers. We demonstrate learning without any explicit annotation of the meanings of user utterances. Instead, we model meaning with latent variables, and introduce a loss function to measure how well potential meanings match the conversation. This loss drives the overall learning approach, which induces a weighted CCG grammar that could be used to automatically bootstrap the semantic analysis component in a complete dialog system. Experiments on DARPA Communicator conversational logs demonstrate effective learning, despite requiring no explicit mean- . ing annotations.</p><p>5 0.34697735 <a title="105-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Data-Driven_Response_Generation_in_Social_Media.html">38 emnlp-2011-Data-Driven Response Generation in Social Media</a></p>

<p>Author: Tong Wang ; Graeme Hirst</p><p>Abstract: We re-investigate the rationale for and the effectiveness of adopting the notions of depth and density in WordNet-based semantic similarity measures. We show that the intuition for including these notions in WordNet-based similarity measures does not always stand up to empirical examination. In particular, the traditional definitions of depth and density as ordinal integer values in the hierarchical structure of WordNet does not always correlate with human judgment of lexical semantic similarity, which imposes strong limitations on their contribution to an accurate similarity measure. We thus propose several novel definitions of depth and density, which yield significant improvement in degree of correlation with similarity. When used in WordNet-based semantic similarity measures, the new definitions consistently improve performance on a task of correlating with human judgment.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.672369 <a title="105-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Predicting_Thread_Discourse_Structure_over_Technical_Web_Forums.html">105 emnlp-2011-Predicting Thread Discourse Structure over Technical Web Forums</a></p>

<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Raghavendra Udupa ; Hal Daume III ; Abhijit Bhole</p><p>Abstract: Mapping documents into an interlingual representation can help bridge the language barrier of cross-lingual corpora. Many existing approaches are based on word co-occurrences extracted from aligned training data, represented as a covariance matrix. In theory, such a covariance matrix should represent semantic equivalence, and should be highly sparse. Unfortunately, the presence of noise leads to dense covariance matrices which in turn leads to suboptimal document representations. In this paper, we explore techniques to recover the desired sparsity in covariance matrices in two ways. First, we explore word association measures and bilingual dictionaries to weigh the word pairs. Later, we explore different selection strategies to remove the noisy pairs based on the association scores. Our experimental results on the task of aligning comparable documents shows the efficacy of sparse covariance matrices on two data sets from two different language pairs.</p><p>4 0.56090337 <a title="105-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Classifying_Sentences_as_Speech_Acts_in_Message_Board_Posts.html">27 emnlp-2011-Classifying Sentences as Speech Acts in Message Board Posts</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashequl Qadir ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: This research studies the text genre of message board forums, which contain a mixture of expository sentences that present factual information and conversational sentences that include communicative acts between the writer and readers. Our goal is to create sentence classifiers that can identify whether a sentence contains a speech act, and can recognize sentences containing four different speech act classes: Commissives, Directives, Expressives, and Representatives. We conduct experiments using a wide variety of features, including lexical and syntactic features, speech act word lists from external resources, and domain-specific semantic class features. We evaluate our results on a collection of message board posts in the domain of veterinary medicine.</p><p>5 0.55725163 <a title="105-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Evaluating_Dependency_Parsing%3A_Robust_and_Heuristics-Free_Cross-Annotation_Evaluation.html">50 emnlp-2011-Evaluating Dependency Parsing: Robust and Heuristics-Free Cross-Annotation Evaluation</a></p>

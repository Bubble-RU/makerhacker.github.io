<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Aria Haghighi ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We explore unsupervised approaches to relation extraction between two named entities; for instance, the semantic bornIn relation between a person and location entity. Concretely, we propose a series of generative probabilistic models, broadly similar to topic models, each which generates a corpus of observed triples of entity mention pairs and the surface syntactic dependency path between them. The output of each model is a clustering of observed relation tuples and their associated textual expressions to underlying semantic relation types. Our proposed models exploit entity type constraints within a relation as well as features on the dependency path between entity mentions. We examine effectiveness of our approach via multiple evaluations and demonstrate 12% error reduction in precision over a state-of-the-art weakly supervised baseline.</p><p>3 0.16496179 <a title="14-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Fast_and_Robust_Joint_Models_for_Biomedical_Event_Extraction.html">59 emnlp-2011-Fast and Robust Joint Models for Biomedical Event Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Extracting biomedical events from literature has attracted much recent attention. The bestperforming systems so far have been pipelines of simple subtask-specific local classifiers. A natural drawback of such approaches are cascading errors introduced in early stages of the pipeline. We present three joint models of increasing complexity designed to overcome this problem. The first model performs joint trigger and argument extraction, and lends itself to a simple, efficient and exact inference algorithm. The second model captures correlations between events, while the third model ensures consistency between arguments of the same event. Inference in these models is kept tractable through dual decomposition. The first two models outperform the previous best joint approaches and are very competitive with respect to the current state-of-theart. The third model yields the best results reported so far on the BioNLP 2009 shared task, the BioNLP 2011 Genia task and the BioNLP 2011Infectious Diseases task.</p><p>4 0.15736511 <a title="14-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_with_Graph_Partitioning.html">145 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction with Graph Partitioning</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Lang ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a method for unsupervised semantic role induction which we formalize as a graph partitioning problem. Argument instances of a verb are represented as vertices in a graph whose edge weights quantify their role-semantic similarity. Graph partitioning is realized with an algorithm that iteratively assigns vertices to clusters based on the cluster assignments of neighboring vertices. Our method is algorithmically and conceptually simple, especially with respect to how problem-specific knowledge is incorporated into the model. Experimental results on the CoNLL 2008 benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model is competitive with other unsupervised approaches in terms of F1 whilst attaining significantly higher cluster purity.</p><p>5 0.12876271 <a title="14-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Hierarchical_Verb_Clustering_Using_Graph_Factorization.html">67 emnlp-2011-Hierarchical Verb Clustering Using Graph Factorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Lin Sun ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: Most previous research on verb clustering has focussed on acquiring flat classifications from corpus data, although many manually built classifications are taxonomic in nature. Also Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications benefit from taxonomic classifications because they vary in terms of the granularity they require from a classification. We introduce a new clustering method called Hierarchical Graph Factorization Clustering (HGFC) and extend it so that it is optimal for the task. Our results show that HGFC outperforms the frequently used agglomerative clustering on a hierarchical test set extracted from VerbNet, and that it yields state-of-the-art performance also on a flat test set. We demonstrate how the method can be used to acquire novel classifications as well as to extend existing ones on the basis of some prior knowledge about the classification.</p><p>6 0.095286354 <a title="14-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_without_Gold_Part-of-Speech_Tags.html">141 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Dependency Parsing without Gold Part-of-Speech Tags</a></p>

<p>Author: Joseph Reisinger ; Raymond Mooney</p><p>Abstract: Context-dependent word similarity can be measured over multiple cross-cutting dimensions. For example, lung and breath are similar thematically, while authoritative and superficial occur in similar syntactic contexts, but share little semantic similarity. Both of these notions of similarity play a role in determining word meaning, and hence lexical semantic models must take them both into account. Towards this end, we develop a novel model, Multi-View Mixture (MVM), that represents words as multiple overlapping clusterings. MVM finds multiple data partitions based on different subsets of features, subject to the marginal constraint that feature subsets are distributed according to Latent Dirich- let Allocation. Intuitively, this constraint favors feature partitions that have coherent topical semantics. Furthermore, MVM uses soft feature assignment, hence the contribution of each data point to each clustering view is variable, isolating the impact of data only to views where they assign the most features. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the utility of MVM as an inductive bias for capturing relations between words that are intuitive to humans, outperforming related models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation.</p><p>6 0.51617098 <a title="14-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_with_Graph_Partitioning.html">145 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction with Graph Partitioning</a></p>

We find that mapping conversational stimuli onto responses is more difficult than translating between languages, due to the wider range of possible responses, the larger fraction of unaligned words/phrases, and the presence of large phrase pairs whose alignment cannot be further decomposed. After addressing these challenges, we compare approaches based on SMT and Information Retrieval in a human evaluation. We show that SMT outperforms IR on this task, and its output is preferred over actual human responses in 15% of cases. As far as we are aware, this is the first work to investigate the use of phrase-based SMT to directly translate a linguistic stimulus into an appropriate response.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.75053638 <a title="14-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-A_generative_model_for_unsupervised_discovery_of_relations_and_argument_classes_from_clinical_texts.html">14 emnlp-2011-A generative model for unsupervised discovery of relations and argument classes from clinical texts</a></p>

<p>Author: Lanjun Zhou ; Binyang Li ; Wei Gao ; Zhongyu Wei ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of opinionated sentences with both positive and negative sentiments1 is a key challenge in sentiment analysis. This paper presents a novel unsupervised method for discovering intra-sentence level discourse relations for eliminating polarity ambiguities. Firstly, a discourse scheme with discourse constraints on polarity was defined empirically based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, a small set of cuephrase-based patterns were utilized to collect a large number of discourse instances which were later converted to semantic sequential representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsupervised method was adopted to generate, weigh and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for recognizing discourse relations. Experimental results showed that the proposed methods not only effectively recognized the defined discourse relations but also achieved significant improvement by integrating discourse information in sentence-level polarity classification.</p><p>4 0.68424243 <a title="14-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Closing_the_Loop%3A_Fast%2C_Interactive_Semi-Supervised_Annotation_With_Queries_on_Features_and_Instances.html">28 emnlp-2011-Closing the Loop: Fast, Interactive Semi-Supervised Annotation With Queries on Features and Instances</a></p>

We present a novel semi-supervised training algorithm developed for this setting, which is (1) fast enough to support real-time interactive speeds, and (2) at least as accurate as preexisting methods for learning with mixed feature and instance labels. Human annotators in user studies were able to produce near-stateof-the-art classifiers—on several corpora in a variety of application domains—with only a few minutes of effort.</p><p>5 0.68308866 <a title="14-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Cooooooooooooooollllllllllllll%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21_Using_Word_Lengthening_to_Detect_Sentiment_in_Microblogs.html">33 emnlp-2011-Cooooooooooooooollllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Using Word Lengthening to Detect Sentiment in Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel Brody ; Nicholas Diakopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method which leverages word lengthening to adapt a sentiment lexicon specifically for Twitter and similar social messaging networks. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we call attention to lengthening as a widespread phenomenon in microblogs and social messaging, and demonstrate the importance of handling it correctly. We then show that lengthening is strongly associated with subjectivity and sentiment. Finally, we present an automatic method which leverages this association to detect domain-specific sentiment- and emotionbearing words. We evaluate our method by comparison to human judgments, and analyze its strengths and weaknesses. Our results are of interest to anyone analyzing sentiment in microblogs and social networks, whether for research or commercial purposes.</p><p>6 0.68295151 <a title="14-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Large-Scale_Noun_Compound_Interpretation_Using_Bootstrapping_and_the_Web_as_a_Corpus.html">78 emnlp-2011-Large-Scale Noun Compound Interpretation Using Bootstrapping and the Web as a Corpus</a></p>

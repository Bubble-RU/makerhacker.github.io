<p>Author: Amit Dubey ; Frank Keller ; Patrick Sturt</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a psycholinguistic model of sentence processing which combines a Hidden Markov Model noun phrase chunker with a co-reference classifier. Both models are fully incremental and generative, giving probabilities of lexical elements conditional upon linguistic structure. This allows us to compute the information theoretic measure of surprisal, which is known to correlate with human processing effort. We evaluate our surprisal predictions on the Dundee corpus of eye-movement data show that our model achieve a better fit with human reading times than a syntax-only model which does not have access to co-reference information.</p><p>3 0.095704928 <a title="84-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Modelling_Discourse_Relations_for_Arabic.html">94 emnlp-2011-Modelling Discourse Relations for Arabic</a></p>
<p>Author: Amal Al-Saif ; Katja Markert</p><p>Abstract: We present the first algorithms to automatically identify explicit discourse connectives and the relations they signal for Arabic text. First we show that, for Arabic news, most adjacent sentences are connected via explicit connectives in contrast to English, making the treatment of explicit discourse connectives for Arabic highly important. We also show that explicit Arabic discourse connectives are far more ambiguous than English ones, making their treatment challenging. In the second part of the paper, we present supervised algorithms to address automatic discourse connective identification and discourse relation recognition. Our connective identifier based on gold standard syntactic features achieves almost human performance. In addition, an identifier based solely on simple lexical and automatically derived morphological and POS features performs with high reliability, essential for languages that do not have high-quality parsers yet. Our algorithm for recognizing discourse relations performs significantly better than a baseline based on the connective surface string alone and therefore reduces the ambiguity in explicit connective interpretation.</p><p>4 0.095622756 <a title="84-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Robust_Disambiguation_of_Named_Entities_in_Text.html">116 emnlp-2011-Robust Disambiguation of Named Entities in Text</a></p>

This paper presents a robust method for collective disambiguation, by harnessing context from knowledge bases and using a new form of coherence graph. It unifies prior approaches into a comprehensive framework that combines three measures: the prior probability of an entity being mentioned, the similarity between the contexts of a mention and a candidate entity, as well as the coherence among candidate entities for all mentions together. The method builds a weighted graph of mentions and candidate entities, and computes a dense subgraph that approximates the best joint mention-entity mapping. Experiments show that the new method significantly outperforms prior methods in terms of accuracy, with robust behavior across a variety of inputs.</p><p>5 0.094811603 <a title="84-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Extreme_Extraction_-_Machine_Reading_in_a_Week.html">57 emnlp-2011-Extreme Extraction - Machine Reading in a Week</a></p>
<p>Author: Marjorie Freedman ; Lance Ramshaw ; Elizabeth Boschee ; Ryan Gabbard ; Gary Kratkiewicz ; Nicolas Ward ; Ralph Weischedel</p><p>Abstract: We report on empirical results in extreme extraction. It is extreme in that (1) from receipt of the ontology specifying the target concepts and relations, development is limited to one week and that (2) relatively little training data is assumed. We are able to surpass human recall and achieve an F1 of 0.5 1 on a question-answering task with less than 50 hours of effort using a hybrid approach that mixes active learning, bootstrapping, and limited (5 hours) manual rule writing. We compare the performance of three systems: extraction with handwritten rules, bootstrapped extraction, and a combination. We show that while the recall of the handwritten rules surpasses that of the learned system, the learned system is able to improve the overall recall and F1.</p><p>6 0.093876123 <a title="84-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Structured_Relation_Discovery_using_Generative_Models.html">128 emnlp-2011-Structured Relation Discovery using Generative Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Aria Haghighi ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We explore unsupervised approaches to relation extraction between two named entities; for instance, the semantic bornIn relation between a person and location entity. Concretely, we propose a series of generative probabilistic models, broadly similar to topic models, each which generates a corpus of observed triples of entity mention pairs and the surface syntactic dependency path between them. The output of each model is a clustering of observed relation tuples and their associated textual expressions to underlying semantic relation types. Our proposed models exploit entity type constraints within a relation as well as features on the dependency path between entity mentions. We examine effectiveness of our approach via multiple evaluations and demonstrate 12% error reduction in precision over a state-of-the-art weakly supervised baseline.</p><p>4 0.46054137 <a title="84-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Robust_Disambiguation_of_Named_Entities_in_Text.html">116 emnlp-2011-Robust Disambiguation of Named Entities in Text</a></p>

<p>Author: Chao Shen ; Tao Li</p><p>Abstract: In active dual supervision, not only informative examples but also features are selected for labeling to build a high quality classifier with low cost. However, how to measure the informativeness for both examples and feature on the same scale has not been well solved. In this paper, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization based approach to address this issue. We first extend the matrix factorization framework to explicitly model the corresponding relationships between feature classes and examples classes. Then by making use of the reconstruction error, we propose a unified scheme to determine which feature or example a classifier is most likely to benefit from having labeled. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p><p>3 0.57691324 <a title="84-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Large-Scale_Noun_Compound_Interpretation_Using_Bootstrapping_and_the_Web_as_a_Corpus.html">78 emnlp-2011-Large-Scale Noun Compound Interpretation Using Bootstrapping and the Web as a Corpus</a></p>

We employ bootstrapping and web statistics, and utilize the relationship between NCs and paraphrasing patterns to jointly extract NCs and such patterns in multiple alternating iterations. In evaluation, we found that having one compound noun fixed yields both a higher number of semantically interpreted NCs and improved accuracy due to stronger semantic restrictions.</p><p>4 0.46554136 <a title="84-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Structured_Lexical_Similarity_via_Convolution_Kernels_on_Dependency_Trees.html">127 emnlp-2011-Structured Lexical Similarity via Convolution Kernels on Dependency Trees</a></p>

Additionally, semantic role classification confirms the benefit of semantic smoothing for dependency kernels.</p><p>5 0.45904732 <a title="84-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Corroborating_Text_Evaluation_Results_with_Heterogeneous_Measures.html">36 emnlp-2011-Corroborating Text Evaluation Results with Heterogeneous Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Enrique Amigo ; Julio Gonzalo ; Jesus Gimenez ; Felisa Verdejo</p><p>Abstract: Automatically produced texts (e.g. translations or summaries) are usually evaluated with n-gram based measures such as BLEU or ROUGE, while the wide set of more sophisticated measures that have been proposed in the last years remains largely ignored for practical purposes. In this paper we first present an indepth analysis of the state of the art in order to clarify this issue. After this, we formalize and verify empirically a set of properties that every text evaluation measure based on similarity to human-produced references satisfies. These properties imply that corroborating system improvements with additional measures always increases the overall reliability of the evaluation process. In addition, the greater the heterogeneity of the measures (which is measurable) the higher their combined reliability. These results support the use of heterogeneous measures in order to consolidate text evaluation results.</p><p>6 0.45848572 <a title="84-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Linking_Entities_to_a_Knowledge_Base_with_Query_Expansion.html">90 emnlp-2011-Linking Entities to a Knowledge Base with Query Expansion</a></p>

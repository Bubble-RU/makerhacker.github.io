</p><p>5 1 Introduction Computational work on referring expression generation (REG) has an extensive history, and a wide variety of algorithms have been proposed, dealing with various facets of what is recognised to be a complex problem. [sent-17, score-0.633]
</p><p>6 Almost all of this work sees the task 1158 as being concerned with choosing those attributes of an intended referent that distinguish it from the other entities with which it might be confused (see, for example, Dale (1989), Dale and Reiter (1995), Krahmer et al. [sent-18, score-0.332]
</p><p>7 Independently, an alternative way of thinking about reference has arisen within the psycholinguistics com-  munity: there is now a long tradition of work that explores how a dialogue participant’s forms of reference are influenced by those previously used for a given entity. [sent-20, score-0.366]
</p><p>8 Most recently, this line of work has been discussed in terms of the notions of alignment (Pickering and Garrod, 2004) and conceptual pacts (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Brennan and Clark, 1996). [sent-21, score-0.272]
</p><p>9 Using a large corpus ofreferring expressions in task-oriented dialogues, this paper presents a machine learning approach that allows us to combine features corresponding to the two perspectives. [sent-23, score-0.131]
</p><p>10 Our results show that models based on the alignment perspective outperform models based on traditional REG considerations, as well as a number of simpler baselines. [sent-24, score-0.168]
</p><p>11 In Section 3, we describe the iMAP Corpus and the referring expressions it contains. [sent-27, score-0.559]
</p><p>12 1 The Algorithmic Approach We use the term algorithmic approach here to refer to the perspective that is common to the considerable body of work within computational linguistics on the problem of referring expression generation developed over the last 20 years. [sent-33, score-0.748]
</p><p>13 This work has focused on the design of algorithms which take into account the context of reference in order to decide what properties of an entity should be mentioned in order to distinguish that entity from others with which it might be confused. [sent-35, score-0.123]
</p><p>14 Early work was concerned with subsequent reference in discourse, inspired by Grosz and Sidner’s (1986) observations  on how the attentional structure of a discourse made particular referents accessible at any given point. [sent-36, score-0.305]
</p><p>15 More recently, attention has shifted to initial reference in visual domains, driven in large part by the availability of the TUNA dataset and the shared tasks that make use of it (Gatt et al. [sent-37, score-0.318]
</p><p>16 Scenarios that require the generation ofreferences in multi-turn dialogues that concern visual scenes are likely to be among the first where we can expect computational approaches to referring expression generation to be practically useful. [sent-40, score-1.034]
</p><p>17 Surprisingly, however, the more recent work on initial reference in visual domains and the earlier work on subsequent reference in discourse remain somewhat distinct and separate from each other, despite much the same algorithms having been used in both. [sent-41, score-0.574]
</p><p>18 There is very little work that brings these two strands together by looking at both initial and subsequent references in dialogues that concern visual scenes. [sent-42, score-0.346]
</p><p>19 However, their approach  was concerned with choosing the type of reference to use (definite or indefinite, pronominal, bare or 1159 modified head noun), and not with the content of the reference; and their data set consisted of only 1242 referring expressions. [sent-45, score-0.73]
</p><p>20 2 The Alignment Approach Meanwhile, starting with the early work of Carroll (1980), a quite distinct strand of research in psycholinguistics has explored how a speaker’s form of reference to an entity is impacted by the way that entity has been previously referred to in the discourse or dialogue. [sent-47, score-0.222]
</p><p>21 The general idea behind what we will call the alignment approach is that a conversational participant will often adopt the same semantic, syntactic and lexical alternatives as the other party in a dialogue. [sent-48, score-0.178]
</p><p>22 With respect to reference in particular, speakers are said to form conceptual pacts in their use of language (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Brennan and Clark, 1996). [sent-50, score-0.296]
</p><p>23 Recent work by Goudbeek and Krahmer (2010) supports the view that subconscious alignment does indeed take place at the level of content selection for referring expressions. [sent-52, score-0.69]
</p><p>24 The participants in their study were more likely to use a dispreferred attribute to describe a target referent if this attribute had recently been used in a description by a confederate. [sent-53, score-0.403]
</p><p>25 There is some work within natural language generation that attempts to model the process of alignment (Buschmeier et al. [sent-54, score-0.209]
</p><p>26 , 2009; Janarthanam and Lemon, 2009), but this is predominantly concerned with what we might think of as the ‘lexical perspective’ , focussing on lexical choice rather than the selection of appropriate semantic content for distinguishing descriptions. [sent-55, score-0.177]
</p><p>27 3  Combined Models  This paper is not the first to look at how the algorithmic approach and the alignment approach might be integrated in REG. [sent-57, score-0.194]
</p><p>28 However, their data set consists of only 393 referring expressions, compared to our 16,358, and these expressions had functions other than identification; most  importantly, the entities referred to were not part of a shared visual scene as is the case in our data. [sent-60, score-0.754]
</p><p>29 Gupta and Stent (2005) instantiated Dale and Reiter’s (1995) Incremental Algorithm with a preference ordering that favours the attributes that were used in the previous mention of the same referent. [sent-61, score-0.258]
</p><p>30 In a second variant, they even require these attributes to be included in a subsequent reference. [sent-62, score-0.259]
</p><p>31 Differently from most other work on REG, they extended the task to include ordering of the attributes in the surface form. [sent-63, score-0.188]
</p><p>32 They therefore create a special evaluation metric that takes ordering into account, which makes it hard to compare the performance they report to that of any system that is not concerned with attribute ordering, such as ours. [sent-64, score-0.16]
</p><p>33 Their evaluation set was also considerably smaller than ours: they used  1294 and 471 referring expressions from two different corpora, compared to our test set of 4947 referring expressions. [sent-65, score-1.021]

</p><p>35 Both participants had a map of the same environment, but one participant’s map showed a route winding its way between the landmarks on the map; see Figure 1. [sent-71, score-0.248]
</p><p>36 In addition to these inherent attributes of the landmarks, participants used spatial relations to other items on the map. [sent-84, score-0.282]
</p><p>37 Each referring expression in the corpus is annotated with a unique identifier corresponding to the landmark that it describes and the semantic values of the attributes that it contains. [sent-85, score-0.84]
</p><p>38 For each landmark R referred to in a dialogue, we view the sequence of references to this landmark as a coreference chain, notated hR1, R2 , . [sent-87, score-0.192]
</p><p>39 From the corpus as a whole we extracted 34,127 referring expressions in 9558 chains. [sent-92, score-0.559]
</p><p>40 References may be contributed to a chain by either speaker, and can be arbitrarily far apart: in the data, 4201 references are in the utterance immediately following the preceding reference in the chain, but the distance between references in a chain can be as high as 423 utterances. [sent-95, score-0.215]
</p><p>41 We removed from the data any annotation that was not concerned with the four landmark attributes, type, colour, relation, or the landmark’s other distinguishing attribute. [sent-96, score-0.177]
</p><p>42 Ordinal numbers that were annotated as the use of the number attribute were re-tagged as spatial relations, as these usually described the position of the target within a line of landmarks. [sent-98, score-0.213]
</p><p>43 As a result of the removal of annotations not pertaining to the use of the four landmark attributes, 2785 referring expressions had no annotation left; we removed these instances from the final data set. [sent-99, score-0.655]

</p><p>46 Similarly, we filter out 6369 initial references after we have extracted features from them, since we focus here on  the generation of subsequent reference only. [sent-118, score-0.305]
</p><p>47 The remaining 16,358 referring expressions form the data which we use in our experiments. [sent-119, score-0.559]
</p><p>48 Contrary to findings from other corpora, in which colour was used much more frequently (Gatt, 2007; Viethen and Dale, 2008), the colour attribute was used in only 26. [sent-120, score-0.491]
</p><p>49 This is probably due to the often low reliability of colour in this task caused by the ink stains. [sent-122, score-0.245]
</p><p>50 The proportion of referring expressions mentioning the target’s type might, at 38. [sent-123, score-0.598]
</p><p>51 16% of the referring expressions, comparable to other corpora in the literature. [sent-129, score-0.462]
</p><p>52 We can think of each referring expression as be-  ing a linguistic realisation of a content pattern: this is the collection of attributes that are used in that instance. [sent-131, score-0.84]
</p><p>53 The attributes can be derived from the property-level annotation given in the corpus. [sent-132, score-0.188]
</p><p>54 So, for example, if a particular reference appears as the noun phrase the blue penguin, annotated semantically as hblue, penguini, then the corresponding ctiocnatlelynt pattern i,sp hcolour, kindi . [sent-133, score-0.164]

</p><p>56 1 The Two Perspectives Our task is defined simply as follows: for each subsequent reference R in the corpus, can we predict the content pattern that will be used in that reference? [sent-137, score-0.331]
</p><p>57 The alignment approach, on the other hand, can be summarised thus: Speakers align the forms of reference they use to be similar or identical to references that have been used before. [sent-140, score-0.255]
</p><p>58 In particular, once a form of reference to the intended referent has been established, they tend to re-use that form of reference, or perhaps an abbreviated version of it. [sent-141, score-0.218]
</p><p>59 The alignment approach would appear to be preferable on the grounds of computational cost: we would expect that retrieving a previously-used referring expression, or parts thereof, generally requires less computation than building a new referring expression from scratch.

</p><p>65 2  Features  The number of factors that can be hypothesised  as  having an impact on the form of a referring expression in a dialogic setting associated with a visual do-  main is very large. [sent-160, score-0.751]
</p><p>66 Instead, we here capture a wide range of factors as features that can be used by a machine learning algorithm to automatically induce from the data a classifier that predicts for a given set of features the attributes that should be used in a referring expression. [sent-162, score-0.718]
</p><p>67 Map Features capture design characteristics of the maps the current dialogue is about; Speaker Features capture the identity and role of the participants; and LMprop Features capture the inherent visual properties of the target referent. [sent-165, score-0.325]

</p><p>74 In addition to the main prediction class content pattern, the split was stratified for Speaker ID and Quartile to ensure that training and test set contained the same proportion of descriptions from each speaker and each quartile of the dialogues. [sent-177, score-0.358]
</p><p>75 We used the J48 algorithm implemented in the Weka toolkit (Witten and Frank, 2005) to train decision trees with the task of judging, based on the given features, which content pattern should be used. [sent-178, score-0.184]
</p><p>76 It generates the same content pattern that was used in the previous mention of the target referent. [sent-182, score-0.254]
</p><p>77 MajorityClass generates the content pattern most commonly used in the training set. [sent-183, score-0.137]
</p><p>78 This gives some measure of the overlap between two referring expressions, assigning a partial score if the two sets share attributes but are not identical. [sent-189, score-0.65]
</p><p>79 Table 5 compares the performances of the three baselines and the decision trees based on the five feature subsets for each of the individual attributes and for the combined content pattern; note that the HeadNounOnly and RepeatLast baselines do not make attribute-specific predictions. [sent-211, score-0.331]
</p><p>80 The table shows that the learned systems outperform all three baselines for the individual attributes as well as for the combined content pattern. [sent-212, score-0.284]
</p><p>81 Also consistent with the results of the three individual feature sets, dropping the Ind features hurts performance more than dropping the TradREG features, but less than dropping the Alignment features. [sent-219, score-0.193]
</p><p>82 These results suggest that considerations at the heart of traditional REG approaches do not play as important a role as those postulated by alignmentbased models for the selection of semantic content for subsequent referring expressions. [sent-222, score-0.723]
</p><p>83 Even in the arguably much simpler non-dialogic domains of the REG competitions concerned with pure content selection, the best performing system achieved only 53% Accuracy (see Gatt et al. [sent-230, score-0.145]

</p><p>85 A DICE score that is equal to the Accuracy score would mean that each referring expression was  either reproduced perfectly, or that a set of attributes was chosen that did not overlap with the original one at all. [sent-246, score-0.744]
</p><p>86 Interestingly, a large number of the referring expressions produced by the model trained only on TradREG features are subsets of the human reference. [sent-249, score-0.593]
</p><p>87 This indicates that human speakers tend to include more attributes than are strictly speaking necessary to distinguish the landmark. [sent-250, score-0.221]

[sent-261, score-0.559]
</p><p>91 1166  7  Conclusions  Using the largest corpus of referring expressions to date, we have shown how both the traditional computational view of REG and the alternative psycholinguistic alignment approach can be captured via a large set of features for machine learning. [sent-271, score-0.807]
</p><p>92 First, we have demonstrated that a model using all these features to predict content patterns in subsequent references in shared visual scenes delivers an Accuracy of 58. [sent-274, score-0.445]
</p><p>93 Second, our error analysis showed that the main reason for the low performance of a model based  on traditional algorithmic features is that it often chooses too few attributes. [sent-278, score-0.132]
</p><p>94 The fact that the model based on the alignment features does not make this mistake so frequently suggests that it may be the psycholinguistic considerations incorporated in our alignment features that lead people to add those additional attributes. [sent-279, score-0.436]
</p><p>95 Finally, while the different models make the same correct predictions about the content of referring expressions in many cases, there are also a considerable number of cases where the models based on either the traditional algorithmic features (10. [sent-280, score-0.787]

<p>Author: Jette Viethen ; Robert Dale ; Markus Guhe</p><p>Abstract: Traditional computational approaches to referring expression generation operate in a deliberate manner, choosing the attributes to be included on the basis of their ability to distinguish the intended referent from its distractors. However, work in psycholinguistics suggests that speakers align their referring expressions with those used previously in the discourse, implying less deliberate choice and more subconscious reuse. This raises the question as to which is a more accurate characterisation of what people do. Using a corpus of dialogues containing 16,358 referring expressions, we explore this question via the generation of subsequent references in shared visual scenes. We use a machine learning approach to referring expression generation and demonstrate that incorporating features that correspond to the computational tradition does not match human referring behaviour as well as using features corresponding to the process of alignment. The results support the view that the traditional model of referring expression generation that is widely assumed in work on natural language generation may not in fact be correct; our analysis may also help explain the oft-observed redundancy found in humanproduced referring expressions.</p><p>2 0.16413039 <a title="62-tfidf-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Exploring_Supervised_LDA_Models_for_Assigning_Attributes_to_Adjective-Noun_Phrases.html">56 emnlp-2011-Exploring Supervised LDA Models for Assigning Attributes to Adjective-Noun Phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Hartung ; Anette Frank</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an attribute selection task as a way to characterize the inherent meaning of property-denoting adjectives in adjective-noun phrases, such as e.g. hot in hot summer denoting the attribute TEMPERATURE, rather than TASTE. We formulate this task in a vector space model that represents adjectives and nouns as vectors in a semantic space defined over possible attributes. The vectors incorporate latent semantic information obtained from two variants of LDA topic models. Our LDA models outperform previous approaches on a small set of 10 attributes with considerable gains on sparse representations, which highlights the strong smoothing power of LDA models. For the first time, we extend the attribute selection task to a new data set with more than 200 classes. We observe that large-scale attribute selection is a hard problem, but a subset of attributes performs robustly on the large scale as well. Again, the LDA models outperform the VSM baseline.</p><p>3 0.090404876 <a title="62-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Correction_Model_for_Word_Alignments.html">3 emnlp-2011-A Correction Model for Word Alignments</a></p>

Word aligners that model the alignment matrix can express arbitrary alignments, but are difficult to decode. We propose an alignment matrix model as a correction algorithm to an underlying sequencebased aligner. Then a greedy decoding algorithm enables the full expressive power of the alignment matrix formulation. Improved alignment performance is shown for all nine language pairs tested.

Cherry@ nrc-cnrc . gc . ca in Redmond, WA 98052 bi l ldol @mi cro so ft . com large corpus of status-response pairs found on Twitter to create a system that responds to Twitter status We present a data-driven approach to generating responses to Twitter status posts, based on phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation. We find that mapping conversational stimuli onto responses is more difficult than translating between languages, due to the wider range of possible responses, the larger fraction of unaligned words/phrases, and the presence of large phrase pairs whose alignment cannot be further decomposed. After addressing these challenges, we compare approaches based on SMT and Information Retrieval in a human evaluation. We show that SMT outperforms IR on this task, and its output is preferred over actual human responses in 15% of cases. As far as we are aware, this is the first work to investigate the use of phrase-based SMT to directly translate a linguistic stimulus into an appropriate response.</p><p>5 0.065184109 <a title="62-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Corpus-Guided_Sentence_Generation_of_Natural_Images.html">34 emnlp-2011-Corpus-Guided Sentence Generation of Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Yezhou Yang ; Ching Teo ; Hal Daume III ; Yiannis Aloimonos</p><p>Abstract: We propose a sentence generation strategy that describes images by predicting the most likely nouns, verbs, scenes and prepositions that make up the core sentence structure. The input are initial noisy estimates of the objects and scenes detected in the image using state of the art trained detectors. As predicting actions from still images directly is unreliable, we use a language model trained from the English Gigaword corpus to obtain their estimates; together with probabilities of co-located nouns, scenes and prepositions. We use these estimates as parameters on a HMM that models the sentence generation process, with hidden nodes as sentence components and image detections as the emissions. Experimental results show that our strategy of combining vision and language produces readable and de- , scriptive sentences compared to naive strategies that use vision alone.</p><p>6 0.061265372 <a title="62-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Probabilistic_Forest-to-String_Model_for_Language_Generation_from_Typed_Lambda_Calculus_Expressions.html">10 emnlp-2011-A Probabilistic Forest-to-String Model for Language Generation from Typed Lambda Calculus Expressions</a></p>

<p>Author: Duangmanee Putthividhya ; Junling Hu</p><p>Abstract: We present a named entity recognition (NER) system for extracting product attributes and values from listing titles. Information extraction from short listing titles present a unique challenge, with the lack of informative context and grammatical structure. In this work, we combine supervised NER with bootstrapping to expand the seed list, and output normalized results. Focusing on listings from eBay’s clothing and shoes categories, our bootstrapped NER system is able to identify new brands corresponding to spelling variants and typographical errors of the known brands, as well as identifying novel brands. Among the top 300 new brands predicted, our system achieves 90.33% precision. To output normalized attribute values, we explore several string comparison algorithms and found n-gram substring matching to work well in practice.</p><p>4 0.45509505 <a title="62-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Correction_Model_for_Word_Alignments.html">3 emnlp-2011-A Correction Model for Word Alignments</a></p>

Both models are fully incremental and generative, giving probabilities of lexical elements conditional upon linguistic structure. This allows us to compute the information theoretic measure of surprisal, which is known to correlate with human processing effort. We evaluate our surprisal predictions on the Dundee corpus of eye-movement data show that our model achieve a better fit with human reading times than a syntax-only model which does not have access to co-reference information.</p><p>3 0.31963807 <a title="62-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Bayesian_Mixture_Model_for_PoS_Induction_Using_Multiple_Features.html">1 emnlp-2011-A Bayesian Mixture Model for PoS Induction Using Multiple Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Christos Christodoulopoulos ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a fully unsupervised syntactic class induction system formulated as a Bayesian multinomial mixture model, where each word type is constrained to belong to a single class. By using a mixture model rather than a sequence model (e.g., HMM), we are able to easily add multiple kinds of features, including those at both the type level (morphology features) and token level (context and alignment features, the latter from parallel corpora). Using only context features, our system yields results comparable to state-of-the art, far better than a similar model without the one-class-per-type constraint. Using the additional features provides added benefit, and our final system outperforms the best published results on most of the 25 corpora tested.</p><p>4 0.31723961 <a title="62-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Correcting_Semantic_Collocation_Errors_with_L1-induced_Paraphrases.html">35 emnlp-2011-Correcting Semantic Collocation Errors with L1-induced Paraphrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for automatic collocation error correction in learner English which is based on paraphrases extracted from parallel corpora. Our key assumption is that collocation errors are often caused by semantic similarity in the first language (L1language) of the writer. An analysis of a large corpus of annotated learner English confirms this assumption. We evaluate our approach on real-world learner data and show that L1-induced paraphrases outperform traditional approaches based on edit distance, homophones, and WordNet synonyms.</p><p>5 0.31635708 <a title="62-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Experimental_Support_for_a_Categorical_Compositional_Distributional_Model_of_Meaning.html">53 emnlp-2011-Experimental Support for a Categorical Compositional Distributional Model of Meaning</a></p>
<p>Author: Edward Grefenstette ; Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh</p><p>Abstract: Modelling compositional meaning for sentences using empirical distributional methods has been a challenge for computational linguists. We implement the abstract categorical model of Coecke et al. (2010) using data from the BNC and evaluate it. The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is based on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences. Our model matches the results of its competitors . in the first experiment, and betters them in the second. The general improvement in results with increase in syntactic complexity showcases the compositional power of our model.</p><p>6 0.31518754 <a title="62-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_a_Parser_for_Machine_Translation_Reordering.html">136 emnlp-2011-Training a Parser for Machine Translation Reordering</a></p>

<p>Author: Amit Dubey ; Frank Keller ; Patrick Sturt</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a psycholinguistic model of sentence processing which combines a Hidden Markov Model noun phrase chunker with a co-reference classifier. Both models are fully incremental and generative, giving probabilities of lexical elements conditional upon linguistic structure. This allows us to compute the information theoretic measure of surprisal, which is known to correlate with human processing effort. We evaluate our surprisal predictions on the Dundee corpus of eye-movement data show that our model achieve a better fit with human reading times than a syntax-only model which does not have access to co-reference information.</p><p>3 0.097192116 <a title="34-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Generating_Subsequent_Reference_in_Shared_Visual_Scenes%3A_Computation_vs_Re-Use.html">62 emnlp-2011-Generating Subsequent Reference in Shared Visual Scenes: Computation vs Re-Use</a></p>
<p>Author: Jette Viethen ; Robert Dale ; Markus Guhe</p><p>Abstract: Traditional computational approaches to referring expression generation operate in a deliberate manner, choosing the attributes to be included on the basis of their ability to distinguish the intended referent from its distractors. However, work in psycholinguistics suggests that speakers align their referring expressions with those used previously in the discourse, implying less deliberate choice and more subconscious reuse. This raises the question as to which is a more accurate characterisation of what people do. Using a corpus of dialogues containing 16,358 referring expressions, we explore this question via the generation of subsequent references in shared visual scenes. We use a machine learning approach to referring expression generation and demonstrate that incorporating features that correspond to the computational tradition does not match human referring behaviour as well as using features corresponding to the process of alignment. The results support the view that the traditional model of referring expression generation that is widely assumed in work on natural language generation may not in fact be correct; our analysis may also help explain the oft-observed redundancy found in humanproduced referring expressions.</p><p>4 0.095903471 <a title="34-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Joint_Model_for_Extended_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">7 emnlp-2011-A Joint Model for Extended Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Vivek Srikumar ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a model that extends semantic role labeling. Existing approaches independently analyze relations expressed by verb predicates or those expressed as nominalizations. However, sentences express relations via other linguistic phenomena as well. Furthermore, these phenomena interact with each other, thus restricting the structures they articulate. In this paper, we use this intuition to define a joint inference model that captures the inter-dependencies between verb semantic role labeling and relations expressed using prepositions. The scarcity of jointly labeled data presents a crucial technical challenge for learning a joint model. The key strength of our model is that we use existing structure predictors as black boxes. By enforcing consistency constraints between their predictions, we show improvements in the performance of both tasks without retraining the individual models.</p><p>5 0.070767999 <a title="34-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Experimental_Support_for_a_Categorical_Compositional_Distributional_Model_of_Meaning.html">53 emnlp-2011-Experimental Support for a Categorical Compositional Distributional Model of Meaning</a></p>
<p>Author: Edward Grefenstette ; Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh</p><p>Abstract: Modelling compositional meaning for sentences using empirical distributional methods has been a challenge for computational linguists. We implement the abstract categorical model of Coecke et al. (2010) using data from the BNC and evaluate it. The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is based on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences. Our model matches the results of its competitors . in the first experiment, and betters them in the second. The general improvement in results with increase in syntactic complexity showcases the compositional power of our model.</p><p>6 0.059278719 <a title="34-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Simple_Word_Trigger_Method_for_Social_Tag_Suggestion.html">11 emnlp-2011-A Simple Word Trigger Method for Social Tag Suggestion</a></p>

<p>Author: Valentin I. Spitkovsky ; Hiyan Alshawi ; Daniel Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We present new training methods that aim to mitigate local optima and slow convergence in unsupervised training by using additional imperfect objectives. In its simplest form, lateen EM alternates between the two objectives of ordinary “soft” and “hard” expectation maximization (EM) algorithms. Switching objectives when stuck can help escape local optima. We find that applying a single such alternation already yields state-of-the-art results for English dependency grammar induction. More elaborate lateen strategies track both objectives, with each validating the moves proposed by the other. Disagreements can signal earlier opportunities to switch or terminate, saving iterations. De-emphasizing fixed points in these ways eliminates some guesswork from tuning EM. An evaluation against a suite of unsupervised dependency parsing tasks, for a vari- ety of languages, showed that lateen strategies significantly speed up training of both EM algorithms, and improve accuracy for hard EM.</p><p>5 0.32101071 <a title="34-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Experimental_Support_for_a_Categorical_Compositional_Distributional_Model_of_Meaning.html">53 emnlp-2011-Experimental Support for a Categorical Compositional Distributional Model of Meaning</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard Farkas</p><p>Abstract: Information-oriented document labeling is a special document multi-labeling task where the target labels refer to a specific information instead of the topic of the whole document. These kind oftasks are usually solved by looking up indicator phrases and analyzing their local context to filter false positive matches. Here, we introduce an approach for machine learning local content shifters which detects irrelevant local contexts using just the original document-level training labels. We handle content shifters in general, instead of learning a particular language phenomenon detector (e.g. negation or hedging) and form a single system for document labeling and content shift detection. Our empirical results achieved 24% error reduction compared to supervised baseline methods – on three document label– ing tasks.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.65764689 <a title="34-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Corpus-Guided_Sentence_Generation_of_Natural_Images.html">34 emnlp-2011-Corpus-Guided Sentence Generation of Natural Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Andre Martins ; Noah Smith ; Mario Figueiredo ; Pedro Aguiar</p><p>Abstract: Dual decomposition has been recently proposed as a way of combining complementary models, with a boost in predictive power. However, in cases where lightweight decompositions are not readily available (e.g., due to the presence of rich features or logical constraints), the original subgradient algorithm is inefficient. We sidestep that difficulty by adopting an augmented Lagrangian method that accelerates model consensus by regularizing towards the averaged votes. We show how first-order logical constraints can be handled efficiently, even though the corresponding subproblems are no longer combinatorial, and report experiments in dependency parsing, with state-of-the-art results. 1</p><p>4 0.53781867 <a title="34-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Twitter_Catches_The_Flu%3A_Detecting_Influenza_Epidemics_using_Twitter.html">139 emnlp-2011-Twitter Catches The Flu: Detecting Influenza Epidemics using Twitter</a></p>
<p>Author: Eiji ARAMAKI ; Sachiko MASKAWA ; Mizuki MORITA</p><p>Abstract: Sachiko MASKAWA The University of Tokyo Tokyo, Japan s achi ko . mas kawa @ gma i . com l Mizuki MORITA National Institute of Biomedical Innovation Osaka, Japan mori ta . mi zuki @ gmai l com . posts more than 5.5 million messages (tweets) every day (reported by Twitter.com in March 201 1). With the recent rise in popularity and scale of social media, a growing need exists for systems that can extract useful information from huge amounts of data. We address the issue of detecting influenza epidemics. First, the proposed system extracts influenza related tweets using Twitter API. Then, only tweets that mention actual influenza patients are extracted by the support vector machine (SVM) based classifier. The experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach (0.89 correlation to the gold standard). Especially at the outbreak and early spread (early epidemic stage), the proposed method shows high correlation (0.97 correlation), which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. This paper describes that Twitter texts reflect the real world, and that NLP techniques can be applied to extract only tweets that contain useful information. 1</p><p>5 0.52842641 <a title="34-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Learning_to_Simplify_Sentences_with_Quasi-Synchronous_Grammar_and_Integer_Programming.html">85 emnlp-2011-Learning to Simplify Sentences with Quasi-Synchronous Grammar and Integer Programming</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristian Woodsend ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: Text simplification aims to rewrite text into simpler versions, and thus make information accessible to a broader audience. Most previous work simplifies sentences using handcrafted rules aimed at splitting long sentences, or substitutes difficult words using a predefined dictionary. This paper presents a datadriven model based on quasi-synchronous grammar, a formalism that can naturally capture structural mismatches and complex rewrite operations. We describe how such a grammar can be induced from Wikipedia and propose an integer linear programming model for selecting the most appropriate simplification from the space of possible rewrites generated by the grammar. We show experimentally that our method creates simplifications that significantly reduce the reading difficulty ofthe input, while maintaining grammaticality and preserving its meaning.</p><p>6 0.5276944 <a title="34-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Corroborating_Text_Evaluation_Results_with_Heterogeneous_Measures.html">36 emnlp-2011-Corroborating Text Evaluation Results with Heterogeneous Measures</a></p>

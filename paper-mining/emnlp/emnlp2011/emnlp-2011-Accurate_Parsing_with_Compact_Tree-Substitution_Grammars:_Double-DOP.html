<p>Author: Wenbin Jiang ; Qun Liu ; Yajuan Lv</p><p>Abstract: We propose a relaxed correspondence assumption for cross-lingual projection of constituent syntax, which allows a supposed constituent of the target sentence to correspond to an unrestricted treelet in the source parse. Such a relaxed assumption fundamentally tolerates the syntactic non-isomorphism between languages, and enables us to learn the target-language-specific syntactic idiosyncrasy rather than a strained grammar directly projected from the source language syntax. Based on this assumption, a novel constituency projection method is also proposed in order to induce a projected constituent treebank from the source-parsed bilingual corpus. Experiments show that, the parser trained on the projected treebank dramatically outperforms previous projected and unsupervised parsers.</p><p>3 0.13706402 <a title="16-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-A_novel_dependency-to-string_model_for_statistical_machine_translation.html">15 emnlp-2011-A novel dependency-to-string model for statistical machine translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen ; Dipanjan Das ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method for prediction of linguistic structure in a language for which only unlabeled data is available, using annotated data from a set of one or more helper languages. Our approach is based on a model that locally mixes between supervised models from the helper languages. Parallel data is not used, allowing the technique to be applied even in domains where human-translated texts are unavailable. We obtain state-of-theart performance for two tasks of structure prediction: unsupervised part-of-speech tagging and unsupervised dependency parsing.</p><p>5 0.11363426 <a title="16-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_without_Gold_Part-of-Speech_Tags.html">141 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Dependency Parsing without Gold Part-of-Speech Tags</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin I. Spitkovsky ; Hiyan Alshawi ; Angel X. Chang ; Daniel Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We show that categories induced by unsupervised word clustering can surpass the performance of gold part-of-speech tags in dependency grammar induction. Unlike classic clustering algorithms, our method allows a word to have different tags in different contexts. In an ablative analysis, we first demonstrate that this context-dependence is crucial to the superior performance of gold tags — requiring a word to always have the same part-ofspeech significantly degrades the performance of manual tags in grammar induction, eliminating the advantage that human annotation has over unsupervised tags. We then introduce a sequence modeling technique that combines the output of a word clustering algorithm with context-colored noise, to allow words to be tagged differently in different contexts. With these new induced tags as input, our state-of- the-art dependency grammar inducer achieves 59. 1% directed accuracy on Section 23 (all sentences) of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus — 0.7% higher than using gold tags.</p><p>6 0.10950184 <a title="16-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Exploiting_Parse_Structures_for_Native_Language_Identification.html">54 emnlp-2011-Exploiting Parse Structures for Native Language Identification</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin Borschinger ; Bevan K. Jones ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: It is often assumed that ‘grounded’ learning tasks are beyond the scope of grammatical inference techniques. In this paper, we show that the grounded task of learning a semantic parser from ambiguous training data as discussed in Kim and Mooney (2010) can be reduced to a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar learning task in a way that gives state of the art results. We further show that additionally letting our model learn the language’s canonical word order improves its performance and leads to the highest semantic parsing f-scores previously reported in the literature.1</p><p>3 0.59061986 <a title="16-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Computation_of_Infix_Probabilities_for_Probabilistic_Context-Free_Grammars.html">31 emnlp-2011-Computation of Infix Probabilities for Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark-Jan Nederhof ; Giorgio Satta</p><p>Abstract: The notion of infix probability has been introduced in the literature as a generalization of the notion of prefix (or initial substring) probability, motivated by applications in speech recognition and word error correction. For the case where a probabilistic context-free grammar is used as language model, methods for the computation of infix probabilities have been presented in the literature, based on various simplifying assumptions. Here we present a solution that applies to the problem in its full generality.</p><p>4 0.53861624 <a title="16-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Relaxed_Cross-lingual_Projection_of_Constituent_Syntax.html">115 emnlp-2011-Relaxed Cross-lingual Projection of Constituent Syntax</a></p>

<p>Author: Sze-Meng Jojo Wong ; Mark Dras</p><p>Abstract: Attempts to profile authors according to their characteristics extracted from textual data, including native language, have drawn attention in recent years, via various machine learning approaches utilising mostly lexical features. Drawing on the idea of contrastive analysis, which postulates that syntactic errors in a text are to some extent influenced by the native language of an author, this paper explores the usefulness of syntactic features for native language identification. We take two types of parse substructure as features— horizontal slices of trees, and the more general feature schemas from discriminative parse reranking—and show that using this kind of syntactic feature results in an accuracy score in classification of seven native languages of around 80%, an error reduction of more than 30%.</p><p>6 0.44937283 <a title="16-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Augmenting_String-to-Tree_Translation_Models_with_Fuzzy_Use_of_Source-side_Syntax.html">20 emnlp-2011-Augmenting String-to-Tree Translation Models with Fuzzy Use of Source-side Syntax</a></p>

We propose a new algorithm to generate translation forest of training data in linear time with the help of word alignment. Our algorithm also alleviates the oracle selection problem by ensuring that a forest always contains derivations that exactly yield the reference translation. With millions of features trained on 519K sentences in 0.03 second per sentence, our system achieves significant improvement by 0.84 BLEU over the baseline system on the NIST Chinese-English test sets.</p><p>3 0.6977005 <a title="16-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-A_novel_dependency-to-string_model_for_statistical_machine_translation.html">15 emnlp-2011-A novel dependency-to-string model for statistical machine translation</a></p>

This method can extract long tail instances of semantic relations like causality from rare and complex expressions in a large Japanese Web corpus in extreme cases, patterns that occur only once in the entire corpus. Such patterns are beyond the reach ofcurrent pattern based methods. We show that our method performs on par with state-of-the-art pattern based methods, and maintains a reasonable level of accuracy even for instances — — acquired from infrequent patterns. This ability to acquire long tail instances is crucial for risk management and innovation, where an exhaustive database of high-level semantic relations like causation is of vital importance.</p><p>5 0.69613773 <a title="16-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Learning_Sentential_Paraphrases_from_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Text-to-Text_Generation.html">83 emnlp-2011-Learning Sentential Paraphrases from Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Text-to-Text Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Juri Ganitkevitch ; Chris Callison-Burch ; Courtney Napoles ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: Previous work has shown that high quality phrasal paraphrases can be extracted from bilingual parallel corpora. However, it is not clear whether bitexts are an appropriate resource for extracting more sophisticated sentential paraphrases, which are more obviously learnable from monolingual parallel corpora. We extend bilingual paraphrase extraction to syntactic paraphrases and demonstrate its ability to learn a variety of general paraphrastic transformations, including passivization, dative shift, and topicalization. We discuss how our model can be adapted to many text generation tasks by augmenting its feature set, development data, and parameter estimation routine. We illustrate this adaptation by using our paraphrase model for the task of sentence compression and achieve results competitive with state-of-the-art compression systems.</p><p>6 0.6941573 <a title="16-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Extreme_Extraction_-_Machine_Reading_in_a_Week.html">57 emnlp-2011-Extreme Extraction - Machine Reading in a Week</a></p>

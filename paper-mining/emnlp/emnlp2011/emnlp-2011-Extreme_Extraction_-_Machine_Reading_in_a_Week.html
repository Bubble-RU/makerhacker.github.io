</p><p>2 We compare the performance of three systems: extraction with handwritten rules, bootstrapped extraction, and a combination. [sent-12, score-0.52]

</p><p>5 (2) Through machine learning and limited human pattern writing (6 hours), we adapted a machine reading system within a week (using less than 50 person hours), achieving question answering performance with an F1 of 0. [sent-36, score-0.499]
</p><p>6 Thus, bootstrap learning with much higher recall at minimal sacrifice in precision is highly desirable. [sent-39, score-0.278]
</p><p>7 The extraction participants focused on named-entity recognition, not relation extraction (May, et al, 2003; Sekine & Grishman, 2003; Li & McCallum, 2003; Maynard et al, 2003). [sent-47, score-0.283]
</p><p>8 The scenario templates of MUC-6 (Grishman & Sundheim, 1996) are more similar to our relation extraction task, although the domain is quite different. [sent-48, score-0.278]
</p><p>9 While MUC-6 systems tended to use finite-state patterns, they did not incorporate bootstrapping or patterns based on the output of a statistical parser. [sent-52, score-0.385]
</p><p>10 An alternative approach to learning classes, applying structural patterns to bootstrap description recognition without active learning, is seen in Riloff (1996) and Kozareva et al. [sent-59, score-0.475]
</p><p>11 Agichtein & Gravano (2000) and Ravichandran & Hovy (2002) reported results for generating surface patterns for relation identification; others have explored similar approaches (e. [sent-65, score-0.447]
</p><p>12 During the first phase, a third party produced an ontology and the resources, which included: brief (~1 paragraph) guidelines for each relation and class in the ontology; ~20 examples for each relation in the ontology; 2K documents that are rich in domain relations. [sent-83, score-0.498]
</p><p>13 97  In phase two, we spent one week extending our extraction system for the new ontology. [sent-86, score-0.352]
</p><p>14 In the fourth phase, our question answering system used the extracted information to answer queries. [sent-88, score-0.293]
</p><p>15 4  Approach to Domain Specialization  Our approach to extracting domain relations integrated novel relation and class detectors into an existing extraction system, designed primarily around the ACE tasks. [sent-89, score-0.405]
</p><p>16  A bootstrap relation learner which given a few seed examples learns patterns that indicate the presence of relations. [sent-92, score-0.603]
</p><p>17  An expressive pattern language which allows a developer to express rules for relation extraction in a simple, but fast manner. [sent-93, score-0.301]
</p><p>18 While question answering requires the system to identify the classes only when they appear in a relation, knowledge of when a class is present provides important information for relation extraction. [sent-99, score-0.426]
</p><p>19 To use this capability, we trained the recognizer at the beginning of the week of domain adaptation and used the predicted classes during learning. [sent-103, score-0.318]
</p><p>20 During the week of domain adaption we developed new heuristics for coreference over non-ACE types. [sent-115, score-0.334]
</p><p>21 3  Relation Extraction  For relation extraction, we used both pattern learning and handwritten patterns. [sent-124, score-0.673]
</p><p>22 We initialized our bootstrap relation learner with the example instances provided with the domain ontology; Table 3 includes examples of the instances provided to the system as training. [sent-125, score-0.526]
</p><p>23 Our bootstrap relation learner finds instances of the relation argument pairs in text and then proposes both predicateargument structure and word-based connections between the arguments as possible new patterns for the relation. [sent-126, score-0.85]
</p><p>24 The learner automatically prunes potential patterns using information about the number of known-to-be true and novel instances matched by a proposed pattern. [sent-127, score-0.417]
</p><p>25 By running the pattern extractor over a large corpus, the proposed patterns generate new seeds which are in turn are used to propose new patterns. [sent-128, score-0.404]
</p><p>26 The pattern writer was given the guidelines, the examples, and a 2K document background corpus and spent 1 hour per relation writing rules. [sent-131, score-0.454]
</p><p>27 The learned patterns use a subset of the full pattern language used by the pattern-writer. [sent-132, score-0.525]
</p><p>28 Figure 1 illustrates learned and handwritten patterns for the possibleTreatmentRelation(). [sent-134, score-0.879]
</p><p>29 The patterns in rectangles match surface-string patterns; the tree-like patterns match normalized predicate argument structure. [sent-135, score-0.769]
</p><p>30 The blue rectangles at the root of the trees in the handwritten patterns are sets of predicates that can be matched by the pattern. [sent-137, score-0.799]
</p><p>31 1440  5  Evaluation  Our question answering evaluation was inspired by the evaluation in DARPA‘s machine reading program, which requires systems to map the information in text into a formal ontology and answer questions based on that ontology. [sent-138, score-0.409]
</p><p>32 Figure 1: Sample Patterns for possibleTreatment()  The evaluation included only queries of the type Find all instances for which the relation P(X, Z) is true where one of X or Z is constant. [sent-142, score-0.268]
</p><p>33 Annotators were given 1hour to find potential answers to each query. [sent-146, score-0.33]
</p><p>34 If no answers were found after 1 hour, the annotators were given a second hour to look for answers. [sent-147, score-0.44]
</p><p>35 For two queries, both of the form Find treatments with an expected date to market of MMYYYY, even after two hours of searching the annotators were unable to find any Annotator answers served as the initial goldstandard. [sent-148, score-0.686]
</p><p>36 Given this initial answer key, annotators reviewed system answers and aligned them with gold-standard answers. [sent-149, score-0.555]
</p><p>37 Because we had only one annotator for each query and because we assumed that any answer found by an annotator was correct, we could not estimate human precision on this task. [sent-154, score-0.287]
</p><p>38 Given the sentence, ACME produces a wide range of drugs including treatments for malaria and athletes foot,‘ our reading system would extract the relations responsibleForTreatment(drugs, ACME), possibleTreatment(drugs, malaria), possibleTreatment(drugs, athletes foot). [sent-160, score-0.457]
</p><p>39 We calculated precision and recall treating underspecified answers as incorrect and separately calculated precision and recall counting underspecified answers as correct. [sent-162, score-1.08]
</p><p>40 Unless otherwise specified, all scores reported here use the stricter condition which treats underspecified answers as incorrect. [sent-165, score-0.401]
</p><p>41 System answers that aligned are correct; those that did not are incorrect; and answers in the key that were not found by the system are misses. [sent-169, score-0.714]
</p><p>42 1  Results Class Detection  7 The answer key may contain some answers that were found neither by the annotator nor by the systems described here, since the answer key includes answers pooled from other systems not reported in this paper. [sent-174, score-0.984]
</p><p>43 Furthermore, if a system answer is marked as correct, but underspecified, the specific answer is put in the key. [sent-176, score-0.282]
</p><p>44 Because a false-alarm in class recognition only leads to an incorrect relation extraction if it appears in a context indicating a domain relation, false alarms of classes may be less important in the question answering and extraction evaluations. [sent-190, score-0.589]
</p><p>45 2 Question Answering and Extraction Figure 2 and Table 6 show system performance using only handwritten rules (HW), only learned patterns (L), and combining both (C). [sent-192, score-0.933]
</p><p>46 Handwritten patterns outperform learned patterns consistently  with much higher recall. [sent-196, score-0.745]
</p><p>47 The learned patterns generate answers not found by handwritten patterns. [sent-200, score-1.209]
</p><p>48 Figure 2: Overall Q/A Performance: All answers in dotted boxes; 'Useful Answers' unboxed The combined system‘s recall (0. [sent-206, score-0.459]
</p><p>49 In the context of our pooled answer-key, the relatively low recall of both the system and the annotator suggests that there was little overlap between the answers found by the annotator and those found by the system. [sent-210, score-0.629]
</p><p>50 As already described, the system answers can include both specific references (e. [sent-211, score-0.384]
</p><p>51 Scores reported thus far treat such answers as correct. [sent-216, score-0.33]
</p><p>52 These answers would be useful when answering more complex queries. [sent-217, score-0.419]
</p><p>53 First, a few bad patterns were manually removed for each relation. [sent-219, score-0.312]
</p><p>54 More importantly, the learning algorithm strongly favors high precision patterns because it needs to maintain a seed set with low noise in order to learn effectively. [sent-220, score-0.363]
</p><p>55 However, in our simple question answering framework such generic answers never convey novel information and thus were probably ignored by human annotators. [sent-222, score-0.524]
</p><p>56 To measure the impact of treating these generic references as correct,10 we did additional annotation on the correct answers, marking answers as ‗useful‘ (specific) and ‗not-useful‘ (generic). [sent-223, score-0.433]
</p><p>57 The unboxed bars in Figure 2 show performance when ‗not-useful‘ answers are removed from the answerkey and the responses. [sent-224, score-0.371]
</p><p>58 For the four relations where there was a change Table 5 provides the relative change performance when only ‗useful‘ answers are considered. [sent-225, score-0.416]
</p><p>59 re-c1H0i4s3on-0LW21he  Non-Useful Answers are Removed Table 7 shows the total number of answers produced by annotators and by each system, as well as the percentage of queries with at least one correct answer for each system. [sent-228, score-0.612]
</p><p>60 For one relation expectedDateOnMarket(), the learned system did not find any answers. [sent-229, score-0.31]
</p><p>61 This relation had far fewer answers found by annotators and occurred far more rarely in the fully annotated extraction set (see Table 8). [sent-230, score-0.596]
</p><p>62 Most likely, the learned system was unable to generate enough novel instances to continue bootstrapping  10 Generic answers cific reference was  treated as correct only if a more available in the document. [sent-236, score-0.668]
</p><p>63 Bootstrap learning has an easier time discovering new instances and new patterns when there are more examples to work with. [sent-249, score-0.368]
</p><p>64 Be-  cause every mention in the document set must be found, the system cannot rely on finding the easiest answers for common relations. [sent-255, score-0.384]
</p><p>65 The three relations for which the learned system has the lowest performance on the question-answering task have the fewest instances annotated in the document set. [sent-259, score-0.317]
</p><p>66 Fewer instance in the large corpus make bootstrapping more difficult—the learner is less able to generate novel instances to expand its pattern set. [sent-260, score-0.27]
</p><p>67 In the following figure, the system identified responsibleForTreatment(Janssen Pharmaceutical, Sporanox), but missed the corresponding relation between Novartis and Lamisil. [sent-263, score-0.285]
</p><p>68 Substance detection might be better served with a web-scale, list-learning approach like the doubly anchored patterns described in (Kozareva et al. [sent-278, score-0.347]
</p><p>69 2  Learned Patterns  One of the ways in which learned patterns supplement handwritten ones is learning highly specific surface-string patterns that are insensitive to errors in parsing. [sent-282, score-1.191]
</p><p>70 Because the handwritten patterns are not exhaustive and make extensive use of syntactic structure, parse errors prevented the system based on handwritten rules from firing. [sent-284, score-1.258]
</p><p>71 Learned surfacestring patterns were able to find these relations. [sent-285, score-0.312]
</p><p>72 Even when the syntactic structure is correct, learned patterns capture expressions not common enough to have been noticed by the rule writer. [sent-286, score-0.433]
</p><p>73 For example, while the handwritten patterns included ‗withdrew’ ’ as a predicate indicating a company was responsible for a drug, they did not include ‗pulled. [sent-287, score-0.806]
</p><p>74 ’ By including ‗pulled’, learned patterns extracted responsibleForTreatment() from ‗American Home Products pulled Duract, a painkiller. [sent-288, score-0.468]
</p><p>75 ’  Similarly, the learned patterns include an explicit pattern ‗CONDITION drug called SUBSTANCE’, and thus extracted a possibleTreatment() relation from ‗newly approved narcolepsy drug called modafinil’ ’ without relying on the coreference component to link drug to modafinil. [sent-289, score-1.199]
</p><p>76 1444 Handwritten Patterns Despite the examples above of successfully learned patterns, handwritten patterns perform significantly better. [sent-290, score-0.879]
</p><p>77 In the active-learning context used for these experiments, the handwritten rules also required less manual effort. [sent-291, score-0.446]
</p><p>78 This comparison is not entirely fair-- while learned patterns required more hours, supervising the bootstrapping algorithm requires no training. [sent-292, score-0.506]
</p><p>79 The handwritten patterns, in contrast, require a trained expert. [sent-293, score-0.446]
</p><p>80 Figure 3: Extractions Missed by Handwritten Rules & the Erroneous Parses that Hid them While handwritten rules and learned patterns use the same language, they make use of it differently. [sent-294, score-0.879]
</p><p>81 A human pattern writer adds relevant synonyms, as well as words that are not synonymous but in the pattern context can be used interchangeably. [sent-296, score-0.31]
</p><p>82 In Figure 4, the handwritten patterns include three word-sets: (patient*, people, participant*); (given, taken, took, using); and (report*, experience*, develop*, suffer*). [sent-297, score-0.758]
</p><p>83 A human pattern writer frequently generates new classes not in the domain ontology. [sent-300, score-0.358]
</p><p>84 In Figure 4, the circled patterns form a class of ‗people taking a substance. [sent-301, score-0.353]
</p><p>85 ‘ The handwritten patterns for studiesDisease() include classes targeting scientists  and researchers. [sent-302, score-0.829]
</p><p>86 Such classes allow the pattern writer to include complex patterns as in Figure 4 and to write relatively precise, but open-ended patterns such as: if there is a single named-drug and a named, non-side-effect disease in the same sentence, the drug is a treatment for the disease. [sent-304, score-1.039]
</p><p>87 hasSideEffect() A final difference between handwritten and learned patterns is the level of predicate-argument complexity used. [sent-305, score-0.879]
</p><p>88 In general, handwritten patterns account for larger spans of predicate argument structure while learned patterns tend to limit themselves to the connections between the arguments of  the relation with minor extensions. [sent-306, score-1.43]
</p><p>89 8  Conclusions and Lessons Learned  First, it is encouraging that the synthesis of learning algorithms and handwritten algorithms can achieve an F1 of 0. [sent-307, score-0.446]
</p><p>90 5 1 in a new domain in a week (<50 hours of effort). [sent-308, score-0.354]
</p><p>91 5 hours of effort) and ~6 hours of active learning for the new classes. [sent-310, score-0.336]
</p><p>92 Third, the effectiveness of learning algorithms is still not competitive with handwritten patterns based on predicate-argument structure (~5 hours of effort on top of active learning for entities). [sent-311, score-1.036]
</p><p>93 Though the dominant factor in missing relations is pattern coverage, missing instances of classes contributed to low recall. [sent-315, score-0.305]
</p><p>94 Comparing learned patterns to manually written patterns, (1) synonyms or other lexical alternatives that a human pattern writer would include, (2) the creation of subclasses for argument types, and (3) the scope of patterns11 are each major sources of the disparity in coverage. [sent-316, score-0.748]
</p><p>95 Fourth, despite the disparity in performance of learned versus manual patterns, and despite the low 11 Learned patterns tend to focus on the between the two arguments, rather than the left and right arguments. [sent-318, score-0.474]
</p><p>96 structure structure  that appears surrounding  1445 recall of learned patterns, the combined system‘s recall and F-Score are higher for three of the relations because the learned patterns generated answers not found by handwritten patterns. [sent-319, score-1.592]
</p><p>97 We found examples where highly specific, learned, surfacelevel patterns (lexical patterns) occasionally found information missed by handwritten patterns due to parsing errors or general low coverage. [sent-320, score-1.166]
</p><p>98 Fifth, the effort for coreference was the most time-consuming, given that every new relation contained at least one of the new argument types. [sent-321, score-0.393]
</p><p>99 Improving generic coreference will reduce domain specific effort in future. [sent-323, score-0.34]

<p>Author: Stijn De Saeger ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Masaaki Tsuchida ; Jun'ichi Kazama ; Chikara Hashimoto ; Ichiro Yamada ; Jong Hoon Oh ; Istvan Varga ; Yulan Yan</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a semi-supervised relation acquisition method that does not rely on extraction patterns (e.g. “X causes Y” for causal relations) but instead learns a combination of indirect evidence for the target relation semantic word classes and partial patterns. This method can extract long tail instances of semantic relations like causality from rare and complex expressions in a large Japanese Web corpus in extreme cases, patterns that occur only once in the entire corpus. Such patterns are beyond the reach ofcurrent pattern based methods. We show that our method performs on par with state-of-the-art pattern based methods, and maintains a reasonable level of accuracy even for instances — — acquired from infrequent patterns. This ability to acquire long tail instances is crucial for risk management and innovation, where an exhaustive database of high-level semantic relations like causation is of vital importance.</p><p>3 0.14997038 <a title="57-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Structured_Relation_Discovery_using_Generative_Models.html">128 emnlp-2011-Structured Relation Discovery using Generative Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Aria Haghighi ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We explore unsupervised approaches to relation extraction between two named entities; for instance, the semantic bornIn relation between a person and location entity. Concretely, we propose a series of generative probabilistic models, broadly similar to topic models, each which generates a corpus of observed triples of entity mention pairs and the surface syntactic dependency path between them. The output of each model is a clustering of observed relation tuples and their associated textual expressions to underlying semantic relation types. Our proposed models exploit entity type constraints within a relation as well as features on the dependency path between entity mentions. We examine effectiveness of our approach via multiple evaluations and demonstrate 12% error reduction in precision over a state-of-the-art weakly supervised baseline.</p><p>4 0.14969407 <a title="57-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_generative_model_for_unsupervised_discovery_of_relations_and_argument_classes_from_clinical_texts.html">14 emnlp-2011-A generative model for unsupervised discovery of relations and argument classes from clinical texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Bryan Rink ; Sanda Harabagiu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a generative model for the automatic discovery of relations between entities in electronic medical records.

This method can extract long tail instances of semantic relations like causality from rare and complex expressions in a large Japanese Web corpus in extreme cases, patterns that occur only once in the entire corpus. Such patterns are beyond the reach ofcurrent pattern based methods. We show that our method performs on par with state-of-the-art pattern based methods, and maintains a reasonable level of accuracy even for instances — — acquired from infrequent patterns. This ability to acquire long tail instances is crucial for risk management and innovation, where an exhaustive database of high-level semantic relations like causation is of vital importance.</p><p>3 0.70532811 <a title="57-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Large-Scale_Noun_Compound_Interpretation_Using_Bootstrapping_and_the_Web_as_a_Corpus.html">78 emnlp-2011-Large-Scale Noun Compound Interpretation Using Bootstrapping and the Web as a Corpus</a></p>

We employ bootstrapping and web statistics, and utilize the relationship between NCs and paraphrasing patterns to jointly extract NCs and such patterns in multiple alternating iterations. In evaluation, we found that having one compound noun fixed yields both a higher number of semantically interpreted NCs and improved accuracy due to stronger semantic restrictions.</p><p>4 0.60530418 <a title="57-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Relation_Extraction_with_Relation_Topics.html">114 emnlp-2011-Relation Extraction with Relation Topics</a></p>

<p>Author: Anthony Fader ; Stephen Soderland ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Open Information Extraction (IE) is the task of extracting assertions from massive corpora without requiring a pre-specified vocabulary. This paper shows that the output of state-ofthe-art Open IE systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions. To overcome these problems, we introduce two simple syntactic and lexical constraints on binary relations expressed by verbs. We implemented the constraints in the REVERB Open IE system, which more than doubles the area under the precision-recall curve relative to previous extractors such as TEXTRUNNER and WOEpos. More than 30% of REVERB’s extractions are at precision 0.8 or higher— compared to virtually none for earlier systems. The paper concludes with a detailed analysis of REVERB’s errors, suggesting directions for future work.1 1 Introduction and Motivation Typically, Information Extraction (IE) systems learn an extractor for each target relation from labeled training examples (Kim and Moldovan, 1993; Riloff, 1996; Soderland, 1999). This approach to IE does not scale to corpora where the number of target relations is very large, or where the target relations cannot be specified in advance. Open IE solves this problem by identifying relation phrases—phrases that denote relations in English sentences (Banko et al., 2007). The automatic identification of rela1The source code for REVERB is available at reverb . cs .washingt on .edu/ http : // 1535 tion phrases enables the extraction of arbitrary relations from sentences, obviating the restriction to a pre-specified vocabulary. Open IE systems have achieved a notable measure of success on massive, open-domain corpora drawn from the Web, Wikipedia, and elsewhere. (Banko et al., 2007; Wu and Weld, 2010; Zhu et al., 2009). The output of Open IE systems has been used to support tasks like learning selectional preferences (Ritter et al., 2010), acquiring common sense knowledge (Lin et al., 2010), and recognizing entailment (Schoen- mackers et al., 2010; Berant et al., 2011). In addition, Open IE extractions have been mapped onto existing ontologies (Soderland et al., 2010). We have observed that two types of errors are frequent in the output of Open IE systems such as TEXTRUNNER and WOE: incoherent extractions and uninformative extractions. Incoherent extractions are cases where the extracted relation phrase has no meaningful interpretation (see Table 1 for examples). Incoherent extractions arise because the learned extractor makes a sequence of decisions about whether to include each word in the relation phrase, often resulting in incomprehensible predictions. To solve this problem, we introduce a syntactic constraint: every multi-word relation phrase must begin with a verb, end with a preposition, and be a contiguous sequence of words in the sentence. Thus, the identification of a relation phrase is made in one fell swoop instead of on the basis of multiple, word-by-word decisions. Uninformative extractions are extractions that omit critical information. For example, consider the sentence “Faust made a deal with the devil.” PreviProce dEindgisnb oufr tgh e, 2 S0c1o1tl Canodn,f eUrKen,c Jeuol yn 2 E7m–3p1ir,ic 2a0l1 M1.e ?tc ho2d0s1 in A Nsasotucira tlio Lnan fogru Cagoem Ppruotcaetisosninagl, L pinag uesis 1ti5c3s5–1545, ous Open IE systems return the uninformative (Faust, made, a deal) instead of (Faust, made a deal with, the devil). This type of error is caused by improper handling of relation phrases that are expressed by a combination of a verb with a noun, such as light verb constructions (LVCs). An LVC is a multi-word expression composed of a verb and a noun, with the noun carrying the semantic content of the predicate (Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995; Stevenson et al., 2004; Allerton, 2002). Table 2 illustrates the wide range of relations expressed this way, which are not captured by existing open extractors. Our syntactic constraint leads the extractor to include nouns in the relation phrase, solving this problem. Although the syntactic constraint significantly reduces incoherent and uninformative extractions, it allows overly-specific relation phrases such as is offering only modest greenhouse gas reduction targets at. To avoid overly-specific relation phrases, we introduce an intuitive lexical constraint: a binary relation phrase ought to appear with at least a minimal number of distinct argument pairs in a large corpus. In summary, this paper articulates two simple but surprisingly powerful constraints on how binary relationships are expressed via verbs in English sentences, and implements them in the REVERB Open IE system. We release REVERB and the data used in our experiments to the research community. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes previous work. Section 3 defines our constraints precisely. Section 4 describes REVERB, our implementation of the constraints. Section 5 reports on our experimental results. Section 6 concludes with a summary and discussion of future work. 2 Previous Work Open IE systems like TEXTRUNNER (Banko et al., 2007), WOEpos, and WOEparse (Wu and Weld, 2010) focus on extracting binary relations of the form (arg1, relation phrase, arg2) from text. These systems all use the following three-step method: 1. Label: Sentences are automatically labeled with extractions using heuristics or distant supervision. 1536 tTSblaoenh rgdpe atyoneMgdrm.uoahcietrsdkcaes1lci4neatodrwnsea.tlrhoianfctsehndNaterufplndergtcoli.sn hkcetrIwnoca stlhceindrstbeoanmgltiRonserplatdion Table 1: Examples of incoherent extractions. Incoherent extractions make up approximately 13% of TEXTRUNNER’s output, 15% of WOEpos’s output, and 30% of WOEparse’s output. tighmosatvdkeihgmosa tvdnkeaicbp lkaroedpucthmsalitonbw,yigtoanhivst,oekamfh,cedotanlusetkroahlntPpr,ohgv.aeDomfvrt,.isonue,atdkhowcainstmdygaevifncromtnaeg oinf Table 2: Examples of uninformative relations (left) and their completions (right). Uninformative relations occur in approximately 4% of WOEparse’s output, 6% of WOEpos’s output, and 7% of TEXTRUNNER’s output. 2. Learn: A relation phrase extractor is learned using a sequence-labeling (e.g., CRF). graphical model 3. Extract: the system takes a sentence as input, identifies a candidate pair of NP arguments (arg1, arg2) from the sentence, and then uses the learned extractor to label each word between the two arguments as part of the relation phrase or not. The extractor is applied to the successive sentences in the corpus, and the resulting extractions are collected. This method faces several challenges. First, the training phase requires a large number of labeled training examples (e.g., 200, 000 heuristicallylabeled sentences for TEXTRUNNER and 300, 000 for WOE). Heuristic labeling of examples obviates hand labeling but results in noisy labels and distorts the distribution of examples. Second, the extraction step is posed as a sequence-labeling problem, where each word is assigned its own label. Because each assignment is uncertain, the likelihood that the extracted relation phrase is flawed increases with the length of the sequence. Finally, the extractor chooses an extraction’s arguments heuristically, and cannot backtrack over this choice. This is problematic when a word that belongs in the relation phrase is chosen as an argument (for example, deal from the “made a deal with” sentence). Because of the feature sets utilized in previous work, the learned extractors ignore both “holistic” aspects of the relation phrase (e.g., is it contiguous?) as well as lexical aspects (e.g., how many instances of this relation are there?). Thus, as we show in Section 5, systems such as TEXTRUNNER are unable to learn the constraints embedded in REVERB. Of course, a learning system, utilizing a different hypothesis space, and an appropriate set of training examples, could potentially learn and refine the constraints in REVERB. This is a topic for future work, which we consider in Section 6. The first Open IE system was TEXTRUNNER (Banko et al., 2007), which used a Naive Bayes model with unlexicalized POS and NP-chunk features, trained using examples heuristically generated from the Penn Treebank. Subsequent work showed that utilizing a linear-chain CRF (Banko and Etzioni, 2008) or Markov Logic Network (Zhu et al., 2009) can lead to improved extraction. The WOE systems introduced by Wu and Weld make use of Wikipedia as a source of training data for their extractors, which leads to further improvements over TEXTRUNNER (Wu and Weld, 2010). Wu and Weld also show that dependency parse features result in a dramatic increase in precision and recall over shallow linguistic features, but at the cost of extraction speed. Other approaches to large-scale IE have included Preemptive IE (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006), OnDemand IE (Sekine, 2006), and weak supervision for IE (Mintz et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2010). Preemptive IE and On-Demand IE avoid relationspecific extractors, but rely on document and entity clustering, which is too costly for Web-scale IE. Weakly supervised methods use an existing ontology to generate training data for learning relationspecific extractors. While this allows for learning relation-specific extractors at a larger scale than what was previously possible, the extractions are still restricted to a specific ontology. Many systems have used syntactic patterns based on verbs to extract relation phrases, usually rely1537 ing on a full dependency parse of the input sentence (Lin and Pantel, 2001 ; Stevenson, 2004; Specia and Motta, 2006; Kathrin Eichler and Neumann, 2008). Our work differs from these approaches by focusing on relation phrase patterns expressed in terms of POS tags and NP chunks, instead of full parse trees. Banko and Etzioni (Banko and Etzioni, 2008) showed that a small set of POS-tag patterns cover a large fraction of relationships in English, but never incorporated the patterns into an extractor. This paper reports on a substantially improved model of binary relation phrases, which increases the recall of the Banko-Etzioni model (see Section 3.3). Further, while previous work in Open IE has mainly focused on syntactic patterns for relation extraction, we introduce a lexical constraint that boosts precision and recall. Finally, Open IE is closely related to semantic role labeling (SRL) (Punyakanok et al., 2008; Toutanova et al., 2008) in that both tasks extract relations and arguments from sentences. However, SRL systems traditionally rely on syntactic parsers, which makes them susceptible to parser errors and substantially slower than Open IE systems such as REVERB. This difference is particularly important when operating on the Web corpus due to its size and heterogeneity. Finally, SRL requires hand-constructed semantic resources like Propbank and Framenet (Martha and Palmer, 2002; Baker et al., 1998) as input. In contrast, Open IE systems require no relation-specific training data. ReVerb, in particular, relies on its explicit lexical and syntactic constraints, which have no correlate in SRL systems. For a more detailed comparison of SRL and Open IE, see (Christensen et al., 2010). 3 Constraints on Relation Phrases In this section we introduce two constraints on relation phrases: a syntactic constraint and a lexical constraint. 3.1 Syntactic Constraint The syntactic constraint serves two purposes. First, it eliminates incoherent extractions, and second, it reduces uninformative extractions by capturing relation phrases expressed by a verb-noun combination, including light verb constructions. PVW= v(p enr oVbupn |a prVta iPcdrtljiec|?lVaedaW|dv in|∗?fpP.rmonar|kder)t Figure 1: A simple part-of-speech-based regular expression reduces the number of incoherent extractions like was central torpedo and covers relations expressed via light verb constructions like gave a talk at. The syntactic constraint requires the relation phrase to match the POS tag pattern shown in Figure 1. The pattern limits relation phrases to be either a verb (e.g., invented), a verb followed immediately by a preposition (e.g., located in), or a verb followed by nouns, adjectives, or adverbs ending in a preposition (e.g., has atomic weight of). Ifthere are multiple possible matches in a sentence for a single verb, the longest possible match is chosen. Finally, if the pattern matches multiple adjacent sequences, we merge them into a single relation phrase (e.g., wants to extend). This refinement enables the model to readily handle relation phrases containing multiple verbs. A consequence ofthis pattern is that the relation phrase must be a contiguous span of words in the sentence. The syntactic constraint eliminates the incoherent relation phrases returned by existing systems. example, given the sentence For Extendicare agreed to buy Arbor Health Care for about US $432 million in cash and assumed debt. TEXTRUNNER returns the extraction (Arbor Health Care, for assumed, debt). The phrase for assumed is clearly not a valid relation phrase: it begins with a preposition and splices together two distant words in the sentence. The syntactic constraint prevents this type of error by simply restricting relation phrases to match the pattern in Figure 1. The syntactic constraint reduces uninformative extractions by capturing relation phrases expressed via LVCs. For example, the POS pattern matched against the sentence “Faust made a deal with the Devil,” would result in the relation phrase made a deal with, instead of the uninformative made. Finally, we require the relation phrase to appear between its two arguments in the sentence. This is a common constraint that has been implicitly enforced in other open extractors. 1538 3.2 Lexical Constraint While the syntactic constraint greatly reduces uninformative extractions, it can sometimes match relation phrases that are so specific that they have only a few possible instances, even in a Web-scale corpus. Consider the sentence: The Obama administration is offering only modest greenhouse gas reduction targets at the conference. The POS pattern will match the phrase: is offering only modest greenhouse gas reduction targets at (1) Thus, there are phrases that satisfy the syntactic constraint, but are not relational. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a lexical constraint that is used to separate valid relation phrases from overspecified relation phrases, like the example in (1). The constraint is based on the intuition that a valid relation phrase should take many distinct arguments in a large corpus. The phrase in (1) is specific to the argument pair (Obama administration, conference), so it is unlikely to represent a bona fide relation. We describe the implementation details of the lexical constraint in Section 4. 3.3 Limitations Our constraints represent an idealized model of relation phrases in English. This raises the question: How much recall is lost due to the constraints? To address this question, we analyzed Wu and Weld’s set of 300 sentences from a set of random Web pages, manually identifying all verb-based relationships between noun phrase pairs. This resulted in a set of 327 relation phrases. For each relation phrase, we checked whether it satisfies our constraints. We found that 85% of the relation phrases do satisfy the constraints. Of the remaining 15%, we identified some of the common cases where the constraints were violated, summarized in Table 3. Many of the example relation phrases shown in Table 3 involve long-range dependencies between words in the sentence. These types of dependencies are not easily representable using a pattern over POS tags. A deeper syntactic analysis of the input sentence would provide a much more general language for modeling relation phrases. For example, one could create a model of relations expressed in Table 3: Approximately 85% of the binary verbal relation phrases in a sample of Web sentences satisfy our constraints. terms of dependency parse features that would capture the non-contiguous relation phrases in Table 3. Previous work has shown that dependency paths do indeed boost the recall of relation extraction systems (Wu and Weld, 2010; Mintz et al., 2009). While using dependency path features allows for a more flexible model of relations, it significantly increases pro- cessing time, which is problematic for Web-scale extraction. Further, we have found that this increased recall comes at the cost of lower precision on Web text (see Section 5). The results in Table 3 are similar to Banko and Etzioni’s findings that a set of eight POS patterns cover a large fraction of binary verbal relation phrases. However, their analysis was based on a set of sentences known to contain either a company acquisition or birthplace relationship, while our results are on a random sample of Web sentences. We applied Banko and Etzioni’s verbal patterns to our random sample of 300 Web sentences, and found that they cover approximately 69% of the relation phrases in the corpus. The gap in recall between this and the 85% shown in Table 3 is largely due to LVC relation phrases (made a deal with) and phrases containing multiple verbs (refuses to return to), which their patterns do not cover. In sum, our model is by no means complete. However, we have empirically shown that the majority of binary verbal relation phrases in a sample of Web sentences are captured by our model. By focusing on this subset of language, our model can 1539 be used to perform Open IE at significantly higher precision than before. 4 REVERB This section introduces REVERB, a novel open extractor based on the constraints defined in the previous section. REVERB first identifies relation phrases that satisfy the syntactic and lexical constraints, and then finds a pair of NP arguments for each identified relation phrase. The resulting extractions are then assigned a confidence score using a logistic regression classifier. This algorithm differs in three important ways from previous methods (Section 2). First, the relation phrase is identified “holistically” rather than word-by-word. Second, potential phrases are filtered based on statistics over a large corpus (the implementation of our lexical constraint). Finally, REVERB is “relation first” rather than “arguments first”, which enables it to avoid a common error made by previous methods—confusing a noun in the relation phrase for an argument, e.g. the noun deal in made a deal with. 4.1 Extraction Algorithm REVERB takes as input a POS-tagged and NPchunked sentence and returns a set of (x, r, y) extraction triples.2 Given an input sentence s, REVERB uses the following extraction algorithm: 1. Relation Extraction: For each verb v in s, find the longest sequence of words rv such that (1) rv starts at v, (2) rv satisfies the syntactic constraint, and (3) rv satisfies the lexical constraint. If any pair of matches are adjacent or overlap in s, merge them into a single match. 2. Argument Extraction: For each relation phrase r identified in Step 1, find the nearest noun phrase x to the left of r in s such that x is not a relative pronoun, WHO-adverb, or existential “there”. Find the nearest noun phrase y to the right of r in s. If such an (x, y) pair could be found, return (x, r, y) as an extraction. We check whether a candidate relation phrase rv satisfies the syntactic constraint by matching it against the regular expression in Figure 1. 2REVERB uses OpenNLP for POS tagging and NP chunking: http : / / opennlp . s ource forge . net / To determine whether rv satisfies the lexical constraint, we use a large dictionary D of relation phrases that are known to take many distinct arguments. In an offline step, we construct D by finding all matches of the POS pattern in a corpus of 500 million Web sentences. For each matching relation phrase, we heuristically identify its arguments (as in Step 2 above). We set D to be the set of all relation phrases that take at least k distinct argument pairs in the set of extractions. In order to allow for minor variations in relation phrases, we normalize each relation phrase by removing inflection, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Based on experiments on a held-out set of sentences, we found that a value of k = 20 works well for filtering out overspecified relations. This results in a set of approximately 1.7 million distinct normalized relation phrases, which are stored in memory at extraction time. As an example of the extraction algorithm in action, consider the following input sentence: Hudson was born in Hampstead, which is a suburb of London. Step 1 of the algorithm identifies three relation phrases that satisfy the syntactic and lexical constraints: was, born in, and is a suburb of. The first two phrases are adjacent in the sentence, so they are merged into the single relation phrase was born in. Step 2 then finds an argument pair for each relation phrase. For was born in, the nearest NPs are (Hudson, Hampstead). For is a suburb of, the extractor skips over the NP which and chooses the argument pair (Hampstead, London). The final output is e1: (Hudson, was born in, Hampstead) e2: (Hampstead, is a suburb of, London). 4.2 Confidence Function The extraction algorithm in the previous section has high recall, but low precision. Like with previous open extractors, we want way to trade recall for precision by tuning a confidence threshold. We use a logistic regression classifier to assign a confidence score to each extraction, which uses the features shown in Table 4. All of these features are efficiently computable and relation independent. We trained the confidence function by manually labeling the extractions from a set of 1, 000 sentences from the Web and Wikipedia as correct or incorrect. 1540 Table 4: REVERB uses these features to assign a confidence score to an extraction (x, r, y) from a sentence s using a logistic regression classifier. Previous open extractors require labeled training data to learn a model of relations, which is then used to extract relation phrases from text. In contrast, REVERB uses a specified model of relations for extraction, and requires labeled data only for assigning confidence scores to its extractions. Learning a confidence function is a much simpler task than learning a full model of relations, using two orders of magnitude fewer training examples than TEXTRUNNER or WOE. 4.3 TEXTRUNNER-R The model of relation phrases used by REVERB is specified, but could a TEXTRUNNER-like system learn this model from training data? While it is difficult to answer such a question for all possible permutations of features sets, training examples, and learning biases, we demonstrate that TEXTRUNNER itself cannot learn REVERB’s model even when re-trained using the output of REVERB as labeled training data. The resulting system, TEXTRUNNER-R, uses the same feature representation as TEXTRUNNER, but different parameters, and a different set of training examples. To generate positive instances, we ran REVERB on the Penn Treebank, which is the same dataset that TEXTRUNNER is trained on. To generate negative instances from a sentence, we took each noun phrase pair in the sentence that does not appear as arguments in a REVERB extraction. This process resulted in a set of 67, 562 positive instances, and 356, 834 negative instances. We then passed these labeled examples to TEXTRUNNER’s training procedure, which learns a linear-chain CRF using closedclass features like POS tags, capitalization, punctuation, etc.TEXTRUNNER-R uses the argument-first extraction algorithm described in Section 2. 5 Experiments We compare REVERB to the following systems: • • REVERB¬lex - The REVERB system described iRn the previous section, but without the lexical constraint. REVERB¬lex uses the same confidence function as REVERB. TEXTRUNNER - Banko and Etzioni’s 2008 extractor, which uses a second order linear-chain CRF trained on extractions heuristically generated from the Penn Treebank. TEXTRUNNER uses shallow linguistic features in its CRF, which come from the same POS tagger and NPchunker that REVERB uses. • • • TEXTRUNNER-R - Our modification to TEXTRUNNER, which uses the same extraction code, but with a model of relations trained on REVERB extractions. WOEpos - Wu and Weld’s modification to TEXTRUNNER, which uses a model of relations learned from extractions heuristically generated from Wikipedia. WOEparse - Wu and Weld’s parser-based extractor, which uses a large dictionary of dependency path patterns learned from heuristic extractions generated from Wikipedia. Each system is given a set of sentences as input, and returns a set of binary extractions as output. We created a test set of 500 sentences sampled from the Web, using Yahoo’s random link service.3 After run3http : / /random . yahoo .com/bin/ryl 1541 rAaneUudeCrv aPdRCAPreu0 0 . 543210 REV RB EV RBWOET XT-WOET XT¬¬lleexx ppaarrssee RRUUNNNNEERR--RR ppooss RRUUNNNNEERR Figure 2: REVERB outperforms state-of-the-art open extractors, with an AUC more than twice that of TEXTRUNNER or WOEpos, and 38% higher than WOEparse.

The judges reached agreement on 86% of the extractions, with an agreement score of κ = 0.68. We report results on the subset of the data where the two judges concur. Thejudges labeled uninformative extractions conservatively. That is, if critical information was dropped from the relation phrase but included in the second argument, it is labeled correct. For example, both the extractions (Ackerman, is a professor of, biology) and (Ackerman, is, a professor of biology) are considered correct. Each system returns confidence scores for its extractions. For a given threshold, we can measure the precision and recall of the output. Precision is the fraction of returned extractions that are correct. Recall is the fraction of correct extractions in EExxttrraaccttiioonnss RReeccaall l Figure 4: REVERB achieves significantly higher precision than state-of-the-art Open IE systems, and comparable recall to WOEparse. the corpus that are returned. We use the total number of extractions labeled as correct by the judges as our measure of recall for the corpus. In order to avoid double-counting, we treat extractions that differ superficially (e.g., different punctuation or dropping inessential modifiers) as a single extraction. We compute a precision-recall curve by varying the confidence threshold, and then compute the area under the curve (AUC). 5.1 Results Figure 2 shows the AUC of each system. REVERB achieves an AUC that is 30% higher than WOEparse and is more than double the AUC of WOEpos or TEXTRUNNER. The lexical constraint provides a significant boost in performance, with REVERB achieving an AUC 23% higher than REVERB¬lex. REVERB proves to be a useful source of training data, with TEXTRUNNER-R having an AUC 71% higher than TEXTRUNNER and performing on par with WOEpos. From the training data, TEXTRUNNER-R was able to learn a model that predicts contiguous relation phrases, but still returned incoherent relation phrases (e.g., starting with a preposition) and overspecified relation phrases. These errors are due to TEXTRUNNER-R overfitting the training data and not having access to the lexical constraint. Figure 3 shows the precision-recall curves of the systems introduced in this paper. TEXTRUNNER-R has much lower precision than REVERB and 1542 RReellaattiioonnss OOnnllyy RReeccaall l Figure 5: On the subtask of identifying relations phrases, REVERB is able to achieve even higher precision and recall than other systems. REVERB¬lex at all levels of recall. The lexical constraint gives REVERB a boost in precision over REVERB¬lex, reducing overspecified extractions from 20% of REVERB¬lex’s output to 1% of REVERB’s. The lexical constraint also boosts recall over REVERB¬lex, since REVERB is able to find a correct relation phrase where REVERB¬lex finds an overspecified one. Figure 4 shows the precision-recall curves of REVERB and the external systems. REVERB has much higher precision than the other systems at nearly all levels of recall. In particular, more than 30% of REVERB’s extractions are at precision 0.8 or higher, compared to virtually none for the other systems. WOEparse achieves a slightly higher recall than REVERB (0.62 versus 0.64), but at the cost of lower precision. In order to highlight the role of the relational model of each system, we also evaluate their performance on the subtask of extracting just the relation phrases from the input text. Figure 5 shows the precision-recall curves for each system on the relation phrase-only evaluation. In this case, REVERB has both higher precision and recall than the other systems. REVERB’s biggest improvement came from the elimination of incoherent extractions. Incoherent extractions were a large fraction of the errors made by previous systems, accounting for approximately 13% of TEXTRUNNER’s extractions, 15% of WOEpos’s, and 30% of WOEparse’s. Uninformative 162857% IOCNmoRt-vhparenE -yrsVc,paoiEtenlRrvcetailBfgu oev-tdinoIur bsgecplroPahtOliroeStsni/c ,phEiunrxhcaoktsreincgtieoransgument Table 5: The majority of the incorrect extractions returned by REVERB are due to errors in argument extraction. extractions had a smaller effect on other systems’ precision, accounting for 4% of WOEparse’s extractions, 5% of WOEpos’s, and 7% of TEXTRUNNER’s, while only appearing in 1% of REVERB’s extractions. REVERB’s reduction in uninformative extractions resulted in a boost in recall, capturing many LVC relation phrases missed by other systems (like those shown in Table 2). To test the systems’ speed, we ran each extractor on a set of 100, 000 sentences using a Pentium 4 machine with 4GB of RAM. The processing times were 16 minutes for REVERB, 21 minutes for TEXTRUNNER, 21 minutes for WOEpos, and 11 hours for WOEparse. The times for REVERB, TEXTRUNNER, and WOEpos are all approximately the same, since they all use the same POS-tagging and NP-chunking software. WOEparse processes each sentence with a dependency parser, resulting in much longer processing time. 5.2 REVERB Error Analysis To better understand the limitations of REVERB, we performed a detailed analysis of its errors in precision (incorrect extractions returned by REVERB) and its errors in recall (correct extractions that REVERB missed). Table 5 summarizes the types of incorrect extractions that REVERB returns. We found that 65% of the incorrect extractions returned by REVERB were cases where a relation phrase was correctly identified, but the argument-finding heuristics failed. The remaining errors were cases where REVERB extracted an incorrect relation phrase. One common mistake that REVERB made was extracting a relation phrase that expresses an n-ary relationship via a ditransitive verb. For example, given the sentence 1543 521873% ICRPdOeolEunSaVt/dciEofhneRuodBnftiakl-dmneMrgnotdiersfoyresudpctroebEcyrxieftlcrxa icertlgaounimcosne tsrain Table 6: The majority of extractions that were missed by REVERB were cases where the correct relation phrase was found, but the arguments were not correctly identified. “I gave him 15 photographs,” REVERB extracts (I, gave, him). These errors are due to the fact that REVERB only models binary relations. Table 6 summarizes the correct extractions that were extracted by other systems and were not extracted by REVERB. As with the false positive extractions, the majority of false negatives (52%) were due to the argument-finding heuristics choosing the wrong arguments, or failing to extract all possible arguments (in the case of coordinating conjunctions). Other sources of failure were due to the lexical constraint either failing to filter out an overspecified relation phrase or filtering out a valid relation phrase. These errors hurt both precision and recall, since each case results in the extractor overlooking a correct relation phrase and choosing another. 5.3 Evaluation At Scale Section 5.1 shows that REVERB outperforms existing Open IE systems when evaluated on a sample of sentences. Previous work has shown that the frequency of an extraction in a large corpus is useful for assessing the correctness of extractions (Downey et al., 2005). Thus, it is possible a priori that REVERB’s gains over previous systems will diminish when extraction frequency is taken into account. In fact, we found that REVERB’s advantage over TEXTRUNNER when run at scale is qualitatively similar to its advantage on single sentences. We ran both REVERB and TEXTRUNNER on Banko and Etzioni’s corpus of 500 million Web sentences and examined the effect of redundancy on precision. As Downey’s work predicts, precision increased in both systems for extractions found multiple times, compared with extractions found only once. However, REVERB had higher precision than TEXTRUNNER at all frequency thresholds. In fact, REVERB’s frequency 1 extractions had a precision of 0.75, which TEXTRUNNER could not approach even with frequency 10 extractions, which had a precision of 0.34. Thus, REVERB is able to return more correct extractions at a higher precision than TEXTRUNNER, even when redundancy is taken into account. 6 Conclusions and Future Work The paper’s contributions are as follows: • We have identified and analyzed the problems oWfe ein hcaovhee riedennt tainfide dun ainndfo armnaaltyivzeed de txhtera pctrioobnlse mfors Open IE systems, and shown their prevalence for systems such as TEXTRUNNER and WOE. • We articulated general, easy-to-enforce consWtreain atrst on binary, nveerrabl,-b aesaseyd rteo-laetniofonr phrases in English that ameliorate these problems and yield richer and more informative relations (see, for example, Table 2). • Based on these constraints, we designed, implemented, haensde e cvoanlustartaeind tsh,e w wReE dVeEsRigBn eedx,tr iamc-tor, which substantially outperforms previous Open IE systems in both recall and precision. • We make REVERB and the data used in our experiments available to the research community.4 In future work, we plan to explore utilizing our constraints to improve the performance of learned CRF models. Roth et al. have shown how to incorporate constraints into CRF learners (Roth and Yih, 2005). It is natural, then, to consider whether the combination of heuristically labeled training examples, CRF learning, and our constraints will result in superior performance. The error analysis in Section 5.2 also suggests natural directions for future work. For instance, since many of REVERB’s errors are due to incorrect arguments, improved methods for argument extraction are in order.

<p>Author: Burr Settles</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes DUALIST, an active learning annotation paradigm which solicits and learns from labels on both features (e.g., words) and instances (e.g., documents). We present a novel semi-supervised training algorithm developed for this setting, which is (1) fast enough to support real-time interactive speeds, and (2) at least as accurate as preexisting methods for learning with mixed feature and instance labels. Human annotators in user studies were able to produce near-stateof-the-art classifiers—on several corpora in a variety of application domains—with only a few minutes of effort.</p><p>6 0.49876425 <a title="57-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Relation_Extraction_with_Relation_Topics.html">114 emnlp-2011-Relation Extraction with Relation Topics</a></p>

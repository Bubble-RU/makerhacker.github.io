<p>Author: Vivek Srikumar ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a model that extends semantic role labeling. Existing approaches independently analyze relations expressed by verb predicates or those expressed as nominalizations. However, sentences express relations via other linguistic phenomena as well. Furthermore, these phenomena interact with each other, thus restricting the structures they articulate. In this paper, we use this intuition to define a joint inference model that captures the inter-dependencies between verb semantic role labeling and relations expressed using prepositions. The scarcity of jointly labeled data presents a crucial technical challenge for learning a joint model. The key strength of our model is that we use existing structure predictors as black boxes. By enforcing consistency constraints between their predictions, we show improvements in the performance of both tasks without retraining the individual models.</p><p>4 0.21277598 <a title="4-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Parse_Correction_with_Specialized_Models_for_Difficult_Attachment_Types.html">102 emnlp-2011-Parse Correction with Specialized Models for Difficult Attachment Types</a></p>
<p>Author: Enrique Henestroza Anguiano ; Marie Candito</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops a framework for syntactic dependency parse correction. Dependencies in an input parse tree are revised by selecting, for a given dependent, the best governor from within a small set of candidates. We use a discriminative linear ranking model to select the best governor from a group of candidates for a dependent, and our model includes a rich feature set that encodes syntactic structure in the input parse tree. The parse correction framework is parser-agnostic, and can correct attachments using either a generic model or specialized models tailored to difficult attachment types like coordination and pp-attachment. Our experiments show that parse correction, combining a generic model with specialized models for difficult attachment types, can successfully improve the quality of predicted parse trees output by sev- eral representative state-of-the-art dependency parsers for French.</p><p>5 0.20399234 <a title="4-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Joint_Models_for_Chinese_POS_Tagging_and_Dependency_Parsing.html">75 emnlp-2011-Joint Models for Chinese POS Tagging and Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenghua Li ; Min Zhang ; Wanxiang Che ; Ting Liu ; Wenliang Chen ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) is an indispensable feature in dependency parsing. Current research usually models POS tagging and dependency parsing independently. This may suffer from error propagation problem. Our experiments show that parsing accuracy drops by about 6% when using automatic POS tags instead of gold ones. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a solution by jointly optimizing POS tagging and dependency parsing in a unique model. We design several joint models and their corresponding decoding algorithms to incorporate different feature sets. We further present an effective pruning strategy to reduce the search space of candidate POS tags, leading to significant improvement of parsing speed. Experimental results on Chinese Penn Treebank 5 show that our joint models significantly improve the state-of-the-art parsing accuracy by about 1.5%. Detailed analysis shows that the joint method is able to choose such POS tags that are more helpful and discriminative from parsing viewpoint. This is the fundamental reason of parsing accuracy improvement.</p><p>6 0.17117284 <a title="4-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Multi-Source_Transfer_of_Delexicalized_Dependency_Parsers.html">95 emnlp-2011-Multi-Source Transfer of Delexicalized Dependency Parsers</a></p>

<p>Author: Deepak Agarwal ; Bee-Chung Chen ; Bo Pang</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, the amount of user-generated opinionated texts (e.g., reviews, user comments) continues to grow at a rapid speed: featured news stories on a major event easily attract thousands of user comments on a popular online News service. How to consume subjective information ofthis volume becomes an interesting and important research question. In contrast to previous work on review analysis that tried to filter or summarize information for a generic average user, we explore a different direction of enabling personalized recommendation of such information. For each user, our task is to rank the comments associated with a given article according to personalized user preference (i.e., whether the user is likely to like or dislike the comment). To this end, we propose a factor model that incorporates rater-comment and rater-author interactions simultaneously in a principled way. Our full model significantly outperforms strong baselines as well as related models that have been considered in previous work.</p><p>2 0.8425588 <a title="4-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Tweets%3A_An_Experimental_Study.html">98 emnlp-2011-Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Sam Clark ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: People tweet more than 100 Million times daily, yielding a noisy, informal, but sometimes informative corpus of 140-character messages that mirrors the zeitgeist in an unprecedented manner. The performance of standard NLP tools is severely degraded on tweets. This paper addresses this issue by re-building the NLP pipeline beginning with part-of-speech tagging, through chunking, to named-entity recognition. Our novel T-NER system doubles F1 score compared with the Stanford NER system. T-NER leverages the redundancy inherent in tweets to achieve this performance, using LabeledLDA to exploit Freebase dictionaries as a source of distant supervision. LabeledLDA outperforms cotraining, increasing F1 by 25% over ten common entity types.

<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to entity linking based on a statistical language model-based information retrieval with query expansion. We use both local contexts and global world knowledge to expand query language models. We place a strong emphasis on named entities in the local contexts and explore a positional language model to weigh them differently based on their distances to the query. Our experiments on the TAC-KBP 2010 data show that incorporating such contextual information indeed aids in disambiguating the named entities and consistently improves the entity linking performance. Compared with the official results from KBP 2010 participants, our system shows competitive performance.</p><p>5 0.68638217 <a title="4-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Domain-Assisted_Product_Aspect_Hierarchy_Generation%3A_Towards_Hierarchical_Organization_of_Unstructured_Consumer_Reviews.html">43 emnlp-2011-Domain-Assisted Product Aspect Hierarchy Generation: Towards Hierarchical Organization of Unstructured Consumer Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxing Yu ; Zheng-Jun Zha ; Meng Wang ; Kai Wang ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a domain-assisted approach to organize various aspects of a product into a hierarchy by integrating domain knowledge (e.g., the product specifications), as well as consumer reviews. Based on the derived hierarchy, we generate a hierarchical organization of consumer reviews on various product aspects and aggregate consumer opinions on these aspects. With such organization, user can easily grasp the overview of consumer reviews. Furthermore, we apply the hierarchy to the task of implicit aspect identification which aims to infer implicit aspects of the reviews that do not explicitly express those aspects but actually comment on them. The experimental results on 11popular products in four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>6 0.6616472 <a title="4-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Correction_Model_for_Word_Alignments.html">3 emnlp-2011-A Correction Model for Word Alignments</a></p>

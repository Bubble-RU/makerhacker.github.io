<p>Author: Johannes Hoffart ; Mohamed Amir Yosef ; Ilaria Bordino ; Hagen Furstenau ; Manfred Pinkal ; Marc Spaniol ; Bilyana Taneva ; Stefan Thater ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: Disambiguating named entities in naturallanguage text maps mentions of ambiguous names onto canonical entities like people or places, registered in a knowledge base such as DBpedia or YAGO. This paper presents a robust method for collective disambiguation, by harnessing context from knowledge bases and using a new form of coherence graph. It unifies prior approaches into a comprehensive framework that combines three measures: the prior probability of an entity being mentioned, the similarity between the contexts of a mention and a candidate entity, as well as the coherence among candidate entities for all mentions together. The method builds a weighted graph of mentions and candidate entities, and computes a dense subgraph that approximates the best joint mention-entity mapping. Experiments show that the new method significantly outperforms prior methods in terms of accuracy, with robust behavior across a variety of inputs.</p><p>3 0.072507322 <a title="112-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Semantic_Topic_Models%3A_Combining_Word_Distributional_Statistics_and_Dictionary_Definitions.html">119 emnlp-2011-Semantic Topic Models: Combining Word Distributional Statistics and Dictionary Definitions</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel topic model based on incorporating dictionary definitions. Traditional topic models treat words as surface strings without assuming predefined knowledge about word meaning. They infer topics only by observing surface word co-occurrence. However, the co-occurred words may not be semantically related in a manner that is relevant for topic coherence. Exploiting dictionary definitions explicitly in our model yields a better understanding of word semantics leading to better text modeling. We exploit WordNet as a lexical resource for sense definitions. We show that explicitly modeling word definitions helps improve performance significantly over the baseline for a text categorization task.</p><p>4 0.065133952 <a title="112-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Harnessing_different_knowledge_sources_to_measure_semantic_relatedness_under_a_uniform_model.html">64 emnlp-2011-Harnessing different knowledge sources to measure semantic relatedness under a uniform model</a></p>

Microsoft Research India IIT Bombay Bangalore damani @ cse . i . ac . in itb s laxman@mi cro s o ft . com of words that co-occur in a large number of docuLexical co-occurrence is an important cue for detecting word associations. We propose a new measure of word association based on a new notion of statistical significance for lexical co-occurrences. Existing measures typically rely on global unigram frequencies to determine expected co-occurrence counts. In- stead, we focus only on documents that contain both terms (of a candidate word-pair) and ask if the distribution of the observed spans of the word-pair resembles that under a random null model. This would imply that the words in the pair are not related strongly enough for one word to influence placement of the other. However, if the words are found to occur closer together than explainable by the null model, then we hypothesize a more direct association between the words. Through extensive empirical evaluation on most of the publicly available benchmark data sets, we show the advantages of our measure over existing co-occurrence measures.</p><p>5 0.34759223 <a title="112-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Corroborating_Text_Evaluation_Results_with_Heterogeneous_Measures.html">36 emnlp-2011-Corroborating Text Evaluation Results with Heterogeneous Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Enrique Amigo ; Julio Gonzalo ; Jesus Gimenez ; Felisa Verdejo</p><p>Abstract: Automatically produced texts (e.g. translations or summaries) are usually evaluated with n-gram based measures such as BLEU or ROUGE, while the wide set of more sophisticated measures that have been proposed in the last years remains largely ignored for practical purposes. In this paper we first present an indepth analysis of the state of the art in order to clarify this issue. After this, we formalize and verify empirically a set of properties that every text evaluation measure based on similarity to human-produced references satisfies. These properties imply that corroborating system improvements with additional measures always increases the overall reliability of the evaluation process. In addition, the greater the heterogeneity of the measures (which is measurable) the higher their combined reliability. These results support the use of heterogeneous measures in order to consolidate text evaluation results.</p><p>6 0.34295854 <a title="112-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Ranking_Human_and_Machine_Summarization_Systems.html">110 emnlp-2011-Ranking Human and Machine Summarization Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Li Wang ; Marco Lui ; Su Nam Kim ; Joakim Nivre ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: Online discussion forums are a valuable means for users to resolve specific information needs, both interactively for the participants and statically for users who search/browse over historical thread data. However, the complex structure of forum threads can make it difficult for users to extract relevant information. The discourse structure of web forum threads, in the form of labelled dependency relationships between posts, has the potential to greatly improve information access over web forum archives. In this paper, we present the task of parsing user forum threads to determine the labelled dependencies between posts. Three methods, including a dependency parsing approach, are proposed to jointly classify the links (relationships) between posts and the dialogue act (type) of each link. The proposed methods significantly surpass an informed baseline. We also experiment with “in situ” classification of evolving threads, and establish that our best methods are able to perform equivalently well over partial threads as complete threads.</p><p>3 0.51565164 <a title="112-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Improving_Bilingual_Projections_via_Sparse_Covariance_Matrices.html">73 emnlp-2011-Improving Bilingual Projections via Sparse Covariance Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Raghavendra Udupa ; Hal Daume III ; Abhijit Bhole</p><p>Abstract: Mapping documents into an interlingual representation can help bridge the language barrier of cross-lingual corpora. Many existing approaches are based on word co-occurrences extracted from aligned training data, represented as a covariance matrix. In theory, such a covariance matrix should represent semantic equivalence, and should be highly sparse. Unfortunately, the presence of noise leads to dense covariance matrices which in turn leads to suboptimal document representations. In this paper, we explore techniques to recover the desired sparsity in covariance matrices in two ways. First, we explore word association measures and bilingual dictionaries to weigh the word pairs. Later, we explore different selection strategies to remove the noisy pairs based on the association scores. Our experimental results on the task of aligning comparable documents shows the efficacy of sparse covariance matrices on two data sets from two different language pairs.</p><p>4 0.40175655 <a title="112-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Correcting_Semantic_Collocation_Errors_with_L1-induced_Paraphrases.html">35 emnlp-2011-Correcting Semantic Collocation Errors with L1-induced Paraphrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for automatic collocation error correction in learner English which is based on paraphrases extracted from parallel corpora. Our key assumption is that collocation errors are often caused by semantic similarity in the first language (L1language) of the writer. An analysis of a large corpus of annotated learner English confirms this assumption. We evaluate our approach on real-world learner data and show that L1-induced paraphrases outperform traditional approaches based on edit distance, homophones, and WordNet synonyms.</p><p>5 0.39620557 <a title="112-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Discourse_Relations_for_Eliminating_Intra-sentence_Polarity_Ambiguities.html">142 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Discovery of Discourse Relations for Eliminating Intra-sentence Polarity Ambiguities</a></p>
<p>Author: Lanjun Zhou ; Binyang Li ; Wei Gao ; Zhongyu Wei ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of opinionated sentences with both positive and negative sentiments1 is a key challenge in sentiment analysis. This paper presents a novel unsupervised method for discovering intra-sentence level discourse relations for eliminating polarity ambiguities. Firstly, a discourse scheme with discourse constraints on polarity was defined empirically based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, a small set of cuephrase-based patterns were utilized to collect a large number of discourse instances which were later converted to semantic sequential representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsupervised method was adopted to generate, weigh and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for recognizing discourse relations. Experimental results showed that the proposed methods not only effectively recognized the defined discourse relations but also achieved significant improvement by integrating discourse information in sentence-level polarity classification.</p><p>6 0.39259601 <a title="112-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Harnessing_WordNet_Senses_for_Supervised_Sentiment_Classification.html">63 emnlp-2011-Harnessing WordNet Senses for Supervised Sentiment Classification</a></p>

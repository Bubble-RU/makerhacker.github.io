<p>Author: Li Wang ; Marco Lui ; Su Nam Kim ; Joakim Nivre ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: Online discussion forums are a valuable means for users to resolve specific information needs, both interactively for the participants and statically for users who search/browse over historical thread data. However, the complex structure of forum threads can make it difficult for users to extract relevant information. The discourse structure of web forum threads, in the form of labelled dependency relationships between posts, has the potential to greatly improve information access over web forum archives. In this paper, we present the task of parsing user forum threads to determine the labelled dependencies between posts. Three methods, including a dependency parsing approach, are proposed to jointly classify the links (relationships) between posts and the dialogue act (type) of each link. The proposed methods significantly surpass an informed baseline. We also experiment with “in situ” classification of evolving threads, and establish that our best methods are able to perform equivalently well over partial threads as complete threads.</p><p>3 0.12500672 <a title="27-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Bootstrapping_Semantic_Parsers_from_Conversations.html">24 emnlp-2011-Bootstrapping Semantic Parsers from Conversations</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Conversations provide rich opportunities for interactive, continuous learning. When something goes wrong, a system can ask for clarification, rewording, or otherwise redirect the interaction to achieve its goals. In this paper, we present an approach for using conversational interactions of this type to induce semantic parsers. We demonstrate learning without any explicit annotation of the meanings of user utterances. Instead, we model meaning with latent variables, and introduce a loss function to measure how well potential meanings match the conversation. This loss drives the overall learning approach, which induces a weighted CCG grammar that could be used to automatically bootstrap the semantic analysis component in a complete dialog system. Experiments on DARPA Communicator conversational logs demonstrate effective learning, despite requiring no explicit mean- . ing annotations.</p><p>4 0.10111482 <a title="27-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Data-Driven_Response_Generation_in_Social_Media.html">38 emnlp-2011-Data-Driven Response Generation in Social Media</a></p>

Cherry@ nrc-cnrc . gc . ca in Redmond, WA 98052 bi l ldol @mi cro so ft . com large corpus of status-response pairs found on Twitter to create a system that responds to Twitter status We present a data-driven approach to generating responses to Twitter status posts, based on phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation. We find that mapping conversational stimuli onto responses is more difficult than translating between languages, due to the wider range of possible responses, the larger fraction of unaligned words/phrases, and the presence of large phrase pairs whose alignment cannot be further decomposed. After addressing these challenges, we compare approaches based on SMT and Information Retrieval in a human evaluation. We show that SMT outperforms IR on this task, and its output is preferred over actual human responses in 15% of cases. As far as we are aware, this is the first work to investigate the use of phrase-based SMT to directly translate a linguistic stimulus into an appropriate response.</p><p>5 0.09685868 <a title="27-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Linear_Text_Segmentation_Using_Affinity_Propagation.html">88 emnlp-2011-Linear Text Segmentation Using Affinity Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Anna Kazantseva ; Stan Szpakowicz</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for linear text segmentation. It is an adaptation of Affinity Propagation, a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm in the framework of factor graphs. Affinity Propagation for Segmentation, or APS, receives a set of pairwise similarities between data points and produces segment boundaries and segment centres data points which best describe all other data points within the segment. APS iteratively passes messages in a cyclic factor graph, until convergence. Each iteration works with information on all available similarities, resulting in highquality results. APS scales linearly for realistic segmentation tasks. We derive the algorithm from the original Affinity Propagation formu– lation, and evaluate its performance on topical text segmentation in comparison with two state-of-the art segmenters. The results suggest that APS performs on par with or outperforms these two very competitive baselines.</p><p>6 0.079084009 <a title="27-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Closing_the_Loop%3A_Fast%2C_Interactive_Semi-Supervised_Annotation_With_Queries_on_Features_and_Instances.html">28 emnlp-2011-Closing the Loop: Fast, Interactive Semi-Supervised Annotation With Queries on Features and Instances</a></p>

Current approaches to AZ rely on supervised machine learning (ML). – – Requiring large amounts of annotated data, these approaches are expensive to develop and port to different domains and tasks. A potential solution to this problem is to use weaklysupervised ML instead. We investigate the performance of four weakly-supervised classifiers on scientific abstract data annotated for multiple AZ classes. Our best classifier based on the combination of active learning and selftraining outperforms our best supervised classifier, yielding a high accuracy of 81% when using just 10% of the labeled data. This result suggests that weakly-supervised learning could be employed to improve the practical applicability and portability of AZ across different information access tasks.</p><p>5 0.39321879 <a title="27-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Closing_the_Loop%3A_Fast%2C_Interactive_Semi-Supervised_Annotation_With_Queries_on_Features_and_Instances.html">28 emnlp-2011-Closing the Loop: Fast, Interactive Semi-Supervised Annotation With Queries on Features and Instances</a></p>

<p>Author: Yang Gao ; Philipp Koehn ; Alexandra Birch</p><p>Abstract: Long-distance reordering remains one of the biggest challenges facing machine translation. We derive soft constraints from the source dependency parsing to directly address the reordering problem for the hierarchical phrasebased model. Our approach significantly improves Chinese–English machine translation on a large-scale task by 0.84 BLEU points on average. Moreover, when we switch the tuning function from BLEU to the LRscore which promotes reordering, we observe total improvements of 1.21 BLEU, 1.30 LRscore and 3.36 TER over the baseline. On average our approach improves reordering precision and recall by 6.9 and 0.3 absolute points, respectively, and is found to be especially effective for long-distance reodering.</p><p>4 0.60819554 <a title="27-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Predicting_Thread_Discourse_Structure_over_Technical_Web_Forums.html">105 emnlp-2011-Predicting Thread Discourse Structure over Technical Web Forums</a></p>

Three methods, including a dependency parsing approach, are proposed to jointly classify the links (relationships) between posts and the dialogue act (type) of each link. The proposed methods significantly surpass an informed baseline. We also experiment with “in situ” classification of evolving threads, and establish that our best methods are able to perform equivalently well over partial threads as complete threads.</p><p>5 0.58344865 <a title="27-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Using_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Structural_Kernels_for_Classifying_Definition_Questions_in_Jeopardy%21.html">147 emnlp-2011-Using Syntactic and Semantic Structural Kernels for Classifying Definition Questions in Jeopardy!</a></p>
<p>Author: Alessandro Moschitti ; Jennifer Chu-carroll ; Siddharth Patwardhan ; James Fan ; Giuseppe Riccardi</p><p>Abstract: The last decade has seen many interesting applications of Question Answering (QA) technology. The Jeopardy! quiz show is certainly one of the most fascinating, from the viewpoints of both its broad domain and the complexity of its language. In this paper, we study kernel methods applied to syntactic/semantic structures for accurate classification of Jeopardy! definition questions. Our extensive empirical analysis shows that our classification models largely improve on classifiers based on word-language models. Such classifiers are also used in the state-of-the-art QA pipeline constituting Watson, the IBM Jeopardy! system. Our experiments measuring their impact on Watson show enhancements in QA accuracy and a consequent increase in the amount of money earned in game-based evaluation.</p><p>6 0.57579815 <a title="27-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Computing_Logical_Form_on_Regulatory_Texts.html">32 emnlp-2011-Computing Logical Form on Regulatory Texts</a></p>

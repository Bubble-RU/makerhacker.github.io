<p>Author: Ryan McDonald ; Slav Petrov ; Keith Hall</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple method for transferring dependency parsers from source languages with labeled training data to target languages without labeled training data. We first demonstrate that delexicalized parsers can be directly transferred between languages, producing significantly higher accuracies than unsupervised parsers. We then use a constraint driven learning algorithm where constraints are drawn from parallel corpora to project the final parser. Unlike previous work on projecting syntactic resources, we show that simple methods for introducing multiple source lan- guages can significantly improve the overall quality of the resulting parsers. The projected parsers from our system result in state-of-theart performance when compared to previously studied unsupervised and projected parsing systems across eight different languages.</p><p>3 0.20774242 <a title="115-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Structure_Prediction_with_Non-Parallel_Multilingual_Guidance.html">146 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Structure Prediction with Non-Parallel Multilingual Guidance</a></p>
<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen ; Dipanjan Das ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method for prediction of linguistic structure in a language for which only unlabeled data is available, using annotated data from a set of one or more helper languages. Our approach is based on a model that locally mixes between supervised models from the helper languages. Parallel data is not used, allowing the technique to be applied even in domains where human-translated texts are unavailable. We obtain state-of-theart performance for two tasks of structure prediction: unsupervised part-of-speech tagging and unsupervised dependency parsing.</p><p>4 0.15279597 <a title="115-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Accurate_Parsing_with_Compact_Tree-Substitution_Grammars%3A_Double-DOP.html">16 emnlp-2011-Accurate Parsing with Compact Tree-Substitution Grammars: Double-DOP</a></p>
<p>Author: Federico Sangati ; Willem Zuidema</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP). Like other DOP models, our parser utilizes syntactic fragments of arbitrary size from a treebank to analyze new sentences, but, crucially, it uses only those which are encountered at least twice. This criterion allows us to work with a relatively small but representative set of fragments, which can be employed as the symbolic backbone of several probabilistic generative models. For parsing we define a transform-backtransform approach that allows us to use standard PCFG technology, making our results easily replicable. According to standard Parseval metrics, our best model is on par with many state-ofthe-art parsers, while offering some complementary benefits: a simple generative probability model, and an explicit representation of the larger units of grammar.</p><p>5 0.14930712 <a title="115-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous_Phrase_Dependency_Grammars_for_Machine_Translation.html">108 emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous Phrase Dependency Grammars for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Gimpel ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We present a quasi-synchronous dependency grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006) for machine translation in which the leaves of the tree are phrases rather than words as in previous work (Gimpel and Smith, 2009). This formulation allows us to combine structural components of phrase-based and syntax-based MT in a single model. We describe a method of extracting phrase dependencies from parallel text using a target-side dependency parser. For decoding, we describe a coarse-to-fine approach based on lattice dependency parsing of phrase lattices. We demonstrate performance improvements for Chinese-English and UrduEnglish translation over a phrase-based baseline. We also investigate the use of unsupervised dependency parsers, reporting encouraging preliminary results.</p><p>6 0.14425807 <a title="115-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-SMT_Helps_Bitext_Dependency_Parsing.html">118 emnlp-2011-SMT Helps Bitext Dependency Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Wenliang Chen ; Jun'ichi Kazama ; Min Zhang ; Yoshimasa Tsuruoka ; Yujie Zhang ; Yiou Wang ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to improve the accuracy of parsing bilingual texts (bitexts) with the help of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. Previous bitext parsing methods use human-annotated bilingual treebanks that are hard to obtain. Instead, our approach uses an auto-generated bilingual treebank to produce bilingual constraints. However, because the auto-generated bilingual treebank contains errors, the bilingual constraints are noisy. To overcome this problem, we use large-scale unannotated data to verify the constraints and design a set of effective bilingual features for parsing models based on the verified results. The experimental results show that our new parsers significantly outperform state-of-theart baselines. Moreover, our approach is still able to provide improvement when we use a larger monolingual treebank that results in a much stronger baseline. Especially notable is that our approach can be used in a purely monolingual setting with the help of SMT.</p><p>5 0.54725266 <a title="115-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Reducing_Grounded_Learning_Tasks_To_Grammatical_Inference.html">111 emnlp-2011-Reducing Grounded Learning Tasks To Grammatical Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Borschinger ; Bevan K. Jones ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: It is often assumed that ‘grounded’ learning tasks are beyond the scope of grammatical inference techniques. In this paper, we show that the grounded task of learning a semantic parser from ambiguous training data as discussed in Kim and Mooney (2010) can be reduced to a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar learning task in a way that gives state of the art results. We further show that additionally letting our model learn the language’s canonical word order improves its performance and leads to the highest semantic parsing f-scores previously reported in the literature.1</p><p>6 0.52255541 <a title="115-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Structure_Prediction_with_Non-Parallel_Multilingual_Guidance.html">146 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Structure Prediction with Non-Parallel Multilingual Guidance</a></p>

<p>Author: Edward Grefenstette ; Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh</p><p>Abstract: Modelling compositional meaning for sentences using empirical distributional methods has been a challenge for computational linguists. We implement the abstract categorical model of Coecke et al. (2010) using data from the BNC and evaluate it. The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is based on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences. Our model matches the results of its competitors . in the first experiment, and betters them in the second. The general improvement in results with increase in syntactic complexity showcases the compositional power of our model.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.82540464 <a title="115-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Relaxed_Cross-lingual_Projection_of_Constituent_Syntax.html">115 emnlp-2011-Relaxed Cross-lingual Projection of Constituent Syntax</a></p>

Evaluating our techniques on two datasets, we report performance above the prior state of the art for estimating sentence similarity and ranking lexical substitutes.</p><p>5 0.73889381 <a title="115-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Fast_Generation_of_Translation_Forest_for_Large-Scale_SMT_Discriminative_Training.html">58 emnlp-2011-Fast Generation of Translation Forest for Large-Scale SMT Discriminative Training</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Yang Liu ; Qun Liu ; Shouxun Lin</p><p>Abstract: Although discriminative training guarantees to improve statistical machine translation by incorporating a large amount of overlapping features, it is hard to scale up to large data due to decoding complexity. We propose a new algorithm to generate translation forest of training data in linear time with the help of word alignment. Our algorithm also alleviates the oracle selection problem by ensuring that a forest always contains derivations that exactly yield the reference translation. With millions of features trained on 519K sentences in 0.03 second per sentence, our system achieves significant improvement by 0.84 BLEU over the baseline system on the NIST Chinese-English test sets.</p><p>6 0.7382493 <a title="115-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Corpus-Guided_Sentence_Generation_of_Natural_Images.html">34 emnlp-2011-Corpus-Guided Sentence Generation of Natural Images</a></p>

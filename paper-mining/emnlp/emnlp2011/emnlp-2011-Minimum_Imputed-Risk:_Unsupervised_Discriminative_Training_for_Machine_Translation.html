These sentences may be selected with simple cross-entropy based methods, of which we present three. As these sentences are not themselves identical to the in-domain data, we call them pseudo in-domain subcorpora. These subcorpora 1% the size of the original can then used to train small domain-adapted Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems which outperform systems trained on the entire corpus. Performance is further improved when we use these domain-adapted models in combination with a true in-domain model. The results show that more training data is not always better, and that best results are attained via proper domain-relevant data selection, as well as combining in- and general-domain systems during decoding. – –</p><p>3 0.11657646 <a title="93-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_dependency_parsers_by_jointly_optimizing_multiple_objectives.html">137 emnlp-2011-Training dependency parsers by jointly optimizing multiple objectives</a></p>

The primary example is the extension of a standard supervised parsing objective function with additional loss-functions, either based on intrinsic parsing quality or task-specific extrinsic measures of quality. Our empirical results show how this approach performs for two dependency parsing algorithms (graph-based and transition-based parsing) and how it achieves increased performance on multiple target tasks including reordering for machine translation and parser adaptation.</p><p>4 0.10672652 <a title="93-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous_Phrase_Dependency_Grammars_for_Machine_Translation.html">108 emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous Phrase Dependency Grammars for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Gimpel ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We present a quasi-synchronous dependency grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006) for machine translation in which the leaves of the tree are phrases rather than words as in previous work (Gimpel and Smith, 2009). This formulation allows us to combine structural components of phrase-based and syntax-based MT in a single model. We describe a method of extracting phrase dependencies from parallel text using a target-side dependency parser. For decoding, we describe a coarse-to-fine approach based on lattice dependency parsing of phrase lattices. We demonstrate performance improvements for Chinese-English and UrduEnglish translation over a phrase-based baseline. We also investigate the use of unsupervised dependency parsers, reporting encouraging preliminary results.</p><p>5 0.10555294 <a title="93-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Better_Evaluation_Metrics_Lead_to_Better_Machine_Translation.html">22 emnlp-2011-Better Evaluation Metrics Lead to Better Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Chang Liu ; Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Many machine translation evaluation metrics have been proposed after the seminal BLEU metric, and many among them have been found to consistently outperform BLEU, demonstrated by their better correlations with human judgment. It has long been the hope that by tuning machine translation systems against these new generation metrics, advances in automatic machine translation evaluation can lead directly to advances in automatic machine translation. However, to date there has been no unambiguous report that these new metrics can improve a state-of-theart machine translation system over its BLEUtuned baseline. In this paper, we demonstrate that tuning Joshua, a hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system, with the TESLA metrics results in significantly better humanjudged translation quality than the BLEUtuned baseline. TESLA-M in particular is simple and performs well in practice on large datasets. We release all our implementation under an open source license. It is our hope that this work will encourage the machine translation community to finally move away from BLEU as the unquestioned default and to consider the new generation metrics when tuning their systems.</p><p>6 0.1044372 <a title="93-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Local_Language_Models.html">125 emnlp-2011-Statistical Machine Translation with Local Language Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Michel Galley ; Chris Quirk</p><p>Abstract: Minimum error rate training is a crucial component to many state-of-the-art NLP applications, such as machine translation and speech recognition. However, common evaluation functions such as BLEU or word error rate are generally highly non-convex and thus prone to search errors. In this paper, we present LP-MERT, an exact search algorithm for minimum error rate training that reaches the global optimum using a series of reductions to linear programming. Given a set of N-best lists produced from S input sentences, this algorithm finds a linear model that is globally optimal with respect to this set. We find that this algorithm is polynomial in N and in the size of the model, but exponential in S. We present extensions of this work that let us scale to reasonably large tuning sets (e.g., one thousand sentences), by either searching only promising regions of the parameter space, or by using a variant of LP-MERT that relies on a beam-search approximation. Experimental results show improvements over the standard Och algorithm.</p><p>3 0.50256675 <a title="93-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Feature-Rich_Language-Independent_Syntax-Based_Alignment_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">60 emnlp-2011-Feature-Rich Language-Independent Syntax-Based Alignment for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Hopkins ; Jonathan May</p><p>Abstract: We offer a simple, effective, and scalable method for statistical machine translation parameter tuning based on the pairwise approach to ranking (Herbrich et al., 1999). Unlike the popular MERT algorithm (Och, 2003), our pairwise ranking optimization (PRO) method is not limited to a handful of parameters and can easily handle systems with thousands of features. Moreover, unlike recent approaches built upon the MIRA algorithm of Crammer and Singer (2003) (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008b), PRO is easy to implement. It uses off-the-shelf linear binary classifier software and can be built on top of an existing MERT framework in a matter of hours. We establish PRO’s scalability and effectiveness by comparing it to MERT and MIRA and demonstrate parity on both phrase-based and syntax-based systems in a variety of language pairs, using large scale data scenarios.</p><p>5 0.47372362 <a title="93-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Structured_Sparsity_in_Structured_Prediction.html">129 emnlp-2011-Structured Sparsity in Structured Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Andre Martins ; Noah Smith ; Mario Figueiredo ; Pedro Aguiar</p><p>Abstract: Linear models have enjoyed great success in structured prediction in NLP. While a lot of progress has been made on efficient training with several loss functions, the problem of endowing learners with a mechanism for feature selection is still unsolved. Common approaches employ ad hoc filtering or L1regularization; both ignore the structure of the feature space, preventing practicioners from encoding structural prior knowledge. We fill this gap by adopting regularizers that promote structured sparsity, along with efficient algorithms to handle them. Experiments on three tasks (chunking, entity recognition, and dependency parsing) show gains in performance, compactness, and model interpretability.</p><p>6 0.45199442 <a title="93-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Domain_Adaptation_via_Pseudo_In-Domain_Data_Selection.html">44 emnlp-2011-Domain Adaptation via Pseudo In-Domain Data Selection</a></p>

<p>Author: Enrique Amigo ; Julio Gonzalo ; Jesus Gimenez ; Felisa Verdejo</p><p>Abstract: Automatically produced texts (e.g. translations or summaries) are usually evaluated with n-gram based measures such as BLEU or ROUGE, while the wide set of more sophisticated measures that have been proposed in the last years remains largely ignored for practical purposes. In this paper we first present an indepth analysis of the state of the art in order to clarify this issue. After this, we formalize and verify empirically a set of properties that every text evaluation measure based on similarity to human-produced references satisfies. These properties imply that corroborating system improvements with additional measures always increases the overall reliability of the evaluation process. In addition, the greater the heterogeneity of the measures (which is measurable) the higher their combined reliability. These results support the use of heterogeneous measures in order to consolidate text evaluation results.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.84104532 <a title="93-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Minimum_Imputed-Risk%3A_Unsupervised_Discriminative_Training_for_Machine_Translation.html">93 emnlp-2011-Minimum Imputed-Risk: Unsupervised Discriminative Training for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Yang Liu ; Qun Liu ; Shouxun Lin</p><p>Abstract: Although discriminative training guarantees to improve statistical machine translation by incorporating a large amount of overlapping features, it is hard to scale up to large data due to decoding complexity. We propose a new algorithm to generate translation forest of training data in linear time with the help of word alignment. Our algorithm also alleviates the oracle selection problem by ensuring that a forest always contains derivations that exactly yield the reference translation. With millions of features trained on 519K sentences in 0.03 second per sentence, our system achieves significant improvement by 0.84 BLEU over the baseline system on the NIST Chinese-English test sets.</p><p>4 0.81431901 <a title="93-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Simple_Word_Trigger_Method_for_Social_Tag_Suggestion.html">11 emnlp-2011-A Simple Word Trigger Method for Social Tag Suggestion</a></p>

Based on the translation probabilities between the words in descriptions and the tags estimated on a large set of description-tags pairs, we build a word trigger method (WTM) to suggest tags according to the words in a resource description.

<p>Author: Ashish Venugopal ; Jakob Uszkoreit ; David Talbot ; Franz Och ; Juri Ganitkevitch</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general method to watermark and probabilistically identify the structured outputs of machine learning algorithms. Our method is robust to local editing operations and provides well defined trade-offs between the ability to identify algorithm outputs and the quality of the watermarked output. Unlike previous work in the field, our approach does not rely on controlling the inputs to the algorithm and provides probabilistic guarantees on the ability to identify collections of results from one’s own algorithm. We present an application in statistical machine translation, where machine translated output is watermarked at minimal loss in translation quality and detected with high recall. 1 Motivation Machine learning algorithms provide structured results to input queries by simulating human behavior. Examples include automatic machine translation (Brown et al. , 1993) or automatic text and rich media summarization (Goldstein et al. , 1999) . These algorithms often estimate some portion of their models from publicly available human generated data. As new services that output structured results are made available to the public and the results disseminated on the web, we face a daunting new challenge: Machine generated structured results contaminate the pool of naturally generated human data. For example, machine translated output 1363 2Center for Language and Speech Processing Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD 21218, USA juri@cs.jhu.edu and human generated translations are currently both found extensively on the web, with no automatic way of distinguishing between them. Algorithms that mine data from the web (Uszkoreit et al. , 2010) , with the goal of learning to simulate human behavior, will now learn models from this contaminated and potentially selfgenerated data, reinforcing the errors committed by earlier versions of the algorithm. It is beneficial to be able to identify a set of encountered structured results as having been generated by one’s own algorithm, with the purpose of filtering such results when building new models. Problem Statement: We define a structured result of a query q as r = {z1 · · · zL} where tthuree odr rdeesru latn dof identity qof a sele rm =en {tzs zi are important to the quality of the result r. The structural aspect of the result implies the existence of alternative results (across both the order of elements and the elements themselves) that might vary in their quality. Given a collection of N results, CN = r1 · · · rN, where each result ri has k rankedC alterna·t·iv·ers Dk (qi) of relatively similar quality and queries q1 · · · qN are arbitrary and not controlled by the watermarking algorithm, we define the watermarking task as: Task.

Impact on Statistical Machine Translation Recent work(Resnik and Smith, 2003; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Uszkoreit et al. , 2010) has shown that multilingual parallel documents can be efficiently identified on the web and used as training data to improve the quality of statistical machine translation. The availability of free translation services (Google Translate, Bing Translate) and tools (Moses, Joshua) , increase the risk that the content found by parallel data mining is in fact generated by a machine, rather than by humans. In this work, we focus on statistical machine translation as an application for watermarking, with the goal of discarding documents from training if they have been generated by one’s own algorithms. To estimate the magnitude of the problem, we used parallel document mining (Uszkoreit et al. , 2010) to generate a collection of bilingual document pairs across several languages. For each document, we inspected the page content for source code that indicates the use of translation modules/plug-ins that translate and publish the translated content. We computed the proportion of the content within our corpus that uses these modules. We find that a significant proportion of the mined parallel data for some language pairs is generated via one of these translation modules. The top 3 languages pairs, each with parallel translations into English, are Tagalog (50.6%) , Hindi (44.5%) and Galician (41.9%) . While these proportions do not reflect impact on each language’s monolingual web, they are certainly high 1364 enough to affect machine translations systems that train on mined parallel data. In this work, we develop a general approach to watermark structured outputs and apply it to the outputs of a statistical machine translation system with the goal of identifying these same outputs on the web. In the context of the watermarking task defined above, we output selecting alternative translations for input source sentences. These translations often undergo simple edit and formatting operations such as case changes, sentence and word deletion or post editing, prior to publishing on the web. We want to ensure that we can still detect watermarked translations despite these edit operations. Given the rapid pace of development within machine translation, it is also important that the watermark be robust to improvements in underlying translation quality. Results from several iterations of the system within a single collection of documents should be identifiable under probabilistic bounds. While we present evaluation results for statistical machine translation, our proposed approach and associated requirements are applicable to any algorithm that produces structured results with several plausible alternatives. The alternative results can arise as a result of inherent task ambiguity (for example, there are multiple correct translations for a given input source sentence) or modeling uncertainty (for example, a model assigning equal probability to two competing results) . 3 Watermark Structured Results Selecting an alternative r0 from the space of alternatives Dk (q) can be stated as: r0= arr∈gDmk(aqx)w(r,Dk(q),h) (1) where w ranks r ∈ Dk (q) based on r’s presentwahtieorne owf a watermarking signal computed by a hashing operation h. In this approach, w and its component operation h are the only secrets held by the watermarker. This selection criterion is applied to all system outputs, ensuring that watermarked and non-watermarked version of a collection will never be available for comparison. A specific implementation of w within our watermarking approach can be evaluated by the following metrics: • • • False Positive Rate: how often nonFwaaltseermarked collections are falsely identified as watermarked. Recall Rate: how often watermarked collRecectiaolnls R are correctly inde wntaitfeierdm as wdat ceorl-marked. Quality Degradation: how significantly dQoueasl CN0 d Dieffegrr fdraotmio CN when evaluated by tdaoseks specific quality Cmetrics. While identification is performed at the collection level, we can scale these metrics based on the size of each collection to provide more task sensitive metrics. For example, in machine translation, we count the number of words in the collection towards the false positive and recall rates. In Section 3.1, we define a random hashing operation h and a task independent implementation of the selector function w. Section 3.2 describes how to classify a collection of watermarked results. Section 3.3 and 3.4 describes refinements to the selection and classification criteria that mitigate quality degradation. Following a comparison to related work in Section 4, we present experimental results for several languages in Section 5. 3.1 Watermarking: CN → CN0 We define a random hashing operation h that is applied to result r. It consists of two components: • A hash function applied to a structured re- sAul ht r hto f generate a lbieitd sequence cotfu a dfix reedlength. • An optional mapping that maps a single cAannd oidptaitoen raels umlta r ntog a hsaett mofa spusb -are ssiunlgtsle. Each sub-result is then hashed to generate a concatenated bit sequence for r. A good hash function produces outputs whose bits are independent. This implies that we can treat the bits for any input structured results 1365 as having been generated by a binomial distribution with equal probability of generating 1s vs 0s. This condition also holds when accumulating the bit sequences over a collection of results as long as its elements are selected uniformly from the space of possible results. Therefore, the bits generated from a collection of unwatermarked results will follow a binomial distribution with parameter p = 0.5. This result provides a null hypothesis for a statistical test on a given bit sequence, testing whether it is likely to have been generated from a binomial distribution binomial(n, p) where p = 0.5 and n is the length of the bit sequence. For a collection CN = r1 · · · rN, we can define a Fwaorte arm coalrlekc ranking funct·i·o·nr w to systematically select alternatives ri0 ∈ Dk (q) , such that the resulting CN0 is unlikely ∈to D produce bit sequences ltthinagt f Collow the p = 0.5 binomial distribution. A straightforward biasing criteria would be to select the candidate whose bit sequence exhibits the highest ratio of 1s. w can be defined as: (2) w(r,Dk(q),h) =#(|h1,(rh)(|r)) where h(r) returns the randomized bit sequence for result r, and #(x, y) counts the number of occurrences of x in sequence Selecting alternatives results to exhibit this bias will result in watermarked collections that exhibit this same bias. y. 3.2 Detecting the Watermark To classify a collection CN as watermarked or non-watermarked, we apply the hashing operation h on each element in CN and concatenate ttihoen sequences. eTlhemis sequence is tested against the null hypothesis that it was generated by a binomial distribution with parameter p = 0.5. We can apply a Fisherian test of statistical significance to determine whether the observed distribution of bits is unlikely to have occurred by chance under the null hypothesis (binomial with p = 0.5) . We consider a collection of results that rejects the null hypothesis to be watermarked results generated by our own algorithms. The p-value under the null hypothesis is efficiently computed by: p − value = Pn (X ≥ x) = Xi=nx?ni?pi(1 − p)n−i (3) (4) where x is the number of 1s observed in the collection, and n is the total number of bits in the sequence. Comparing this p-value against a desired significance level α, we reject the null hypothesis for collections that have Pn(X ≥ x) < α, thus deciding that such collections( were gen- erated by our own system. This classification criteria has a fixed false positive rate. Setting α = 0.05, we know that 5% of non-watermarked bit sequences will be falsely labeled as watermarked. This parameter α can be controlled on an application specific basis. By biasing the selection of candidate results to produce more 1s than 0s, we have defined a watermarking approach that exhibits a fixed false positive rate, a probabilistically bounded detection rate and a task independent hashing and selection criteria. In the next sections, we will deal with the question of robustness to edit operations and quality degradation. 3.3 Robustness and Inherent Bias We would like the ability to identify watermarked collections to be robust to simple edit operations. Even slight modifications to the elements within an item r would yield (by construction of the hash function) , completely different bit sequences that no longer preserve the biases introduced by the watermark selection function. To ensure that the distributional biases introduced by the watermark selector are preserved, we can optionally map individual results into a set of sub-results, each one representing some local structure of r. h is then applied to each subresult and the results concatenated to represent r. This mapping is defined as a component of the h operation. While a particular edit operation might affect a small number of sub-results, the majority of the bits in the concatenated bit sequence for r would remain untouched, thereby limiting the damage to the biases selected during watermark1366 ing. This is of course no defense to edit operations that are applied globally across the result; our expectation is that such edits would either significantly degrade the quality of the result or be straightforward to identify directly. For example, a sequence of words r = z1 · · · zL can be mapped into a set of consecutive n-gram sequences. Operations to edit a word zi in r will only affect events that consider the word zi. To account for the fact that alternatives in Dk (q) might now result in bit sequences of different lengths, we can generalize the biasing criteria to directly reflect the expected contribution to the watermark by defining: w(r, Dk(q), h) = Pn(X ≥ #(1, h(r))) (5) where Pn gives probabilities from binomial(n = |h(r) |,p = 0.5) . (Irn)|h,epr =en 0t. 5c)o.llection level biases: Our null hypothesis is based on the assumption that collections of results draw uniformly from the space of possible results. This assumption might not always hold and depends on the type of the results and collection. For example, considering a text document as a collection of sentences, we can expect that some sentences might repeat more frequently than others. This scenario is even more likely when applying a mapping into sub-results. n-gram sequences follow long-tailed or Zipfian distributions, with a small number of n-grams contributing heavily toward the total number of n-grams in a document. A random hash function guarantees that inputs are distributed uniformly at random over the output range. However, the same input will be assigned the same output deterministically. Therefore, if the distribution of inputs is heavily skewed to certain elements of the input space, the output distribution will not be uniformly distributed. The bit sequences resulting from the high frequency sub-results have the potential to generate inherently biased distributions when accumulated at the collection level. We want to choose a mapping that tends towards generating uniformly from the space of sub-results. We can empirically measure the quality of a sub-result mapping for a specific task by computing the false positive rate on non-watermarked collections. For a given significance level α, an ideal mapping would result in false positive rates close to α as well. Figure 1 shows false positive rates from 4 alternative mappings, computed on a large corpus of French documents (see Table 1for statistics) . Classification decisions are made at the collection level (documents) but the contribution to the false positive rate is based on the number of words in the classified document. We consider mappings from a result (sentence) into its 1-grams, 1 − 5-grams and 3 − 5 grams as well as trahem non-mapping case, w 3h −ere 5 tghrea mfusll a sres wuelltl is hashed.

The 3 − 5 gram mapping yields pfaolsseit positive r.a Ttesh ecl 3os −e t 5o gthraemir theoretically expected values. 1 Small deviations are expected since documents make different contributions to the false positive rate as a function of the number of words that they represent. For the remainder of this work, we use the 3-5 gram mapping and the full sentence mapping, since the alternatives generate inherently distributions with very high false positive rates. 3.4 Considering Quality The watermarking described in Equation 3 chooses alternative results on a per result basis, with the goal of influencing collection level bit sequences. The selection criteria as described will choose the most biased candidates available in Dk (q) . The parameter k determines the extent to which lesser quality alternatives can be chosen. If all the alternatives in each Dk (q) are of relatively similar quality, we expect minimal degradation due to watermarking. Specific tasks however can be particularly sensitive to choosing alternative results. Discriminative approaches that optimize for arg max selection like (Och, 2003; Liang et al. , 2006; Chiang et al. , 2009) train model parameters such 1In the final version of this paper we will perform sampling to create a more reliable estimate of the false positive rate that is not overly influenced by document length distributions. 1367 that the top-ranked result is well separated from its competing alternatives. Different queries also differ in the inherent ambiguity expected from their results; sometimes there really is just one correct result for a query, while for other queries, several alternatives might be equally good. By generalizing the definition of the w function to interpolate the estimated loss in quality and the gain in the watermarking signal, we can trade-off the ability to identify the watermarked collections against quality degradation: w(r,Dk(q),fw)− =(1 λ − ∗ λ g)ai ∗nl( or,s D(rk,(Dq)k,(fqw)) (6) Loss: The loss(r, Dk (q)) function reflects the quality degradation that results from selecting alternative r as opposed to the best ranked candidate in Dk (q)) . We will experiment with two variants: lossrank (r, Dk (q)) = (rank(r) − k)/k losscost(r, Dk(q)) = (cost(r)−cost(r1))/ cost(r1) where: • • • rank(r) : returns the rank of r within Dk (q) . cost(r) : a weighted sum of features (not cnoosrtm(ra)li:ze ad over httheed sse uarmch o space) rine a loglinear model such as those mentioned in (Och, 2003). r1: the highest ranked alternative in Dk (q) . lossrank provides a generally applicable criteria to select alternatives, penalizing selection from deep within Dk (q) . This estimate of the quality degradation does not reflect the generating model’s opinion on relative quality. losscost considers the relative increase in the generating model’s cost assigned to the alternative translation. Gain: The gain(r, Dk (q) , fw) function reflects the gain in the watermarking signal by selecting candidate r. We simply define the gain as the Pn(X ≥ #(1, h(r))) from Equation 5. ptendcuo mfrsi 0 . 204186eoxbpsecrvted0.510.25 p-value threshold (a) 1-grams mapping ptendcuo mfrsi 0 . 204186eoxbpsecrvted0.510.25 p-value threshold (c) 3 − 5-grams mapping ptendcuo mfrsi 0 . 204186eoxbpsecrvted0.510.25 ptendcuo mfrsi 0 . 204186eoxbpsecrvted0.510.25 p-value threshold (b) 1− 5-grams mapping p-value threshold (d) Full result hashing Figure 1 Comparison : of expected false positive rates against observed false positive rates for different sub-result mappings. 4 Related Work Using watermarks with the goal of transmitting a hidden message within images, video, audio and monolingual text media is common. For structured text content, linguistic approaches like (Chapman et al. , 2001; Gupta et al., 2006) use language specific linguistic and semantic expansions to introduce hidden watermarks. These expansions provide alternative candidates within which messages can be encoded. Recent publications have extended this idea to machine translation, using multiple systems and expansions to generate alternative translations. (Stutsman et al. , 2006) uses a hashing function to select alternatives that encode the hidden message in the lower order bits of the translation. In each of these approaches, the watermarker has control over the collection of results into which the watermark is to be embedded. These approaches seek to embed a hidden message into a collection of results that is selected by the watermarker. In contrast, we address the condition where the input queries are not in the watermarker’s control. 1368 The goal is therefore to introduce the watermark into all generated results, with the goal of probabilistically identifying such outputs. Our approach is also task independent, avoiding the need for templates to generate additional alternatives. By addressing the problem directly within the search space of a dynamic programming algorithm, we have access to high quality alternatives with well defined models of quality loss. Finally, our approach is robust to local word editing. By using a sub-result mapping, we increase the level of editing required to obscure the watermark signal; at high levels of editing, the quality of the results themselves would be significantly degraded. 5 Experiments We evaluate our watermarking approach applied to the outputs of statistical machine translation under the following experimental setup. A repository of parallel (aligned source and target language) web documents is sampled to produce a large corpus on which to evaluate the watermarking classification performance. The corpora represent translations into 4 diverse target languages, using English as the source language. Each document in this corpus can be considered a collection of un-watermarked structured results, where source sentences are queries and each target sentence represents a structured result. Using a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system (Och and Ney, 2004) trained on parallel documents identified by (Uszkoreit et al. , 2010) , we generate a set of 100 alternative translations for each source sentence. We apply the proposed watermarking approach, along with the proposed refinements that address task specific loss (Section 3.4) and robustness to edit operations (Section 3.3) to generate watermarked corpora. Each method is controlled via a single parameter (like k or λ) which is varied to generate alternative watermarked collections. For each parameter value, we evaluate the Recall Rate and Quality Degradation with the goal of finding a setting that yields a high recall rate, minimal quality degradation. False positive rates are evaluated based on a fixed classification significance level of α = 0.05. The false positive and recall rates are evaluated on the word level; a document that is misclassified or correctly identified contributes its length in words towards the error calculation. In this work, we use α = 0.05 during classification corresponding to an expected 5% false positive rate. The false positive rate is a function of h and the significance level α and therefore constant across the parameter values k and λ. We evaluate quality degradation on human translated test corpora that are more typical for machine translation evaluation. Each test corpus consists of 5000 source sentences randomly selected from the web and translated into each respective language. We chose to evaluate quality on test corpora to ensure that degradations are not hidden by imperfectly matched web corpora and are consistent with the kind of results often reported for machine translation systems. As with the classification corpora, we create watermarked versions at each parameter value. For a given pa1369 recall Figure 2: BLEU loss against recall of watermarked content for the baseline approach (max K-best) , rank and cost interpolation. rameter value, we measure false positive and re- call rates on the classification corpora and quality degradation on the evaluation corpora. Table 1 shows corpus statistics for the classification and test corpora and non-watermarked BLEU scores for each target language. All source texts are in English. 5.1 Loss Interpolated Experiments Our first set of experiments demonstrates baseline performance using the watermarking criteria in Equation 5 versus the refinements suggested in Section 3.4 to mitigate quality degradation. The h function is computed on the full sentence result r with no sub-event mapping. The following methods are evaluated in Figure 2. • • Baseline method (labeled “max K-best” ): sBealescetlsin er0 purely (blaasbedel on gain Kin- bweastte”r):marking signal (Equation 5) and is parameterized by k: the number of alternatives considered for each result.

U462579 B%LEU scores are reported for the quality corpora. We consider 0.2% BLEU loss as a threshold for acceptable quality degradation. Each method is judged by its ability to achieve high recall below this quality degradation threshold. Applying cost interpolation yields the best results in Figure 2, achieving a recall of 85% at 0.2% BLEU loss, while rank interpolation achieves a recall of 76%. The baseline approach of selecting the highest gain candidate within a depth of k candidates does not provide sufficient parameterization to yield low quality degradation. At k = 2, this method yields almost 90% recall, but with approximately 0.4% BLEU loss. 5.2 Robustness Experiments In Section 5.2, we proposed mapping results into sub-events or features. We considered alternative feature mappings in Figure 1, finding that mapping sentence results into a collection of 35 grams yields acceptable false positive rates at varied levels of α. Figure 3 presents results that compare moving from the result level hashing to the 3-5 gram sub-result mapping. We show the impact of the mapping on the baseline max K-best method as well as for cost interpolation. There are substantial reductions in recall rate at the 0.2% BLEU loss level when applying sub-result mappings in cases. The cost interpolation method recall drops from 85% to 77% when using the 3-5 grams event mapping. The observed false positive rate of the 3-5 gram mapping is 4.7%. By using the 3-5 gram mapping, we expect to increase robustness against local word edit operations, but we have sacrificed recall rate due to the inherent distributional bias discussed in Section 3.3. 1370 recall Figure 3: BLEU loss against recall of watermarked content for the baseline and cost interpolation methods using both result level and 3-5 gram mapped events. 5.3 Multilingual Experiments The watermarking approach proposed here introduces no language specific watermarking operations and it is thus broadly applicable to translating into all languages. In Figure 4, we report results for the baseline and cost interpolation methods, considering both the result level and 3-5 gram mapping. We set α = 0.05 and measure recall at 0.2% BLEU degradation for translation from English into Arabic, French, Hindi and Turkish. The observed false positive rates for full sentence hashing are: Arabic: 2.4%, French: 1.8%, Hindi: 5.6% and Turkish: 5.5%, while for the 3-5 gram mapping, they are: Arabic: 5.8%, French: 7.5%, Hindi:3.5% and Turkish: 6.2%. Underlying translation quality plays an important role in translation quality degradation when watermarking. Without a sub-result mapping, French (BLEU: 26.45%) Figure 4: Loss of recall when using 3-5 gram mapping vs sentence level mapping for Arabic, French, Hindi and Turkish translations. achieves recall of 85% at 0.2% BLEU loss, while the other languages achieve over 90% recall at the same BLEU loss threshold. Using a subresult mapping degrades quality for each language pair, but changes the relative performance. Turkish experiences the highest relative drop in recall, unlike French and Arabic, where results are relatively more robust to using sub-sentence mappings. This is likely a result of differences in n-gram distributions across these languages. The languages considered here all use space separated words. For languages that do not, like Chinese or Thai, our approach can be applied at the character level. 6 Conclusions In this work we proposed a general method to watermark and probabilistically identify the structured outputs of machine learning algorithms. Our method provides probabilistic bounds on detection ability, analytic control on quality degradation and is robust to local edit- ing operations. Our method is applicable to any task where structured outputs are generated with ambiguities or ties in the results. We applied this method to the outputs of statistical machine translation, evaluating each refinement to our approach with false positive and recall rates against BLEU score quality degradation. Our results show that it is possible, across several language pairs, to achieve high recall rates (over 80%) with low false positive rates (between 5 and 8%) at minimal quality degradation (0.2% 1371 BLEU) , while still allowing for local edit operations on the translated output. In future work we will continue to investigate methods to mitigate quality loss. References Thorsten Brants, Ashok C. Popat, Peng Xu, Franz J. Och, and Jeffrey Dean. 2007.

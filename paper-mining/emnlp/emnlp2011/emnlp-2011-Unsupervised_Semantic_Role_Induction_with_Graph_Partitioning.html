<p>Author: Vivek Srikumar ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a model that extends semantic role labeling. Existing approaches independently analyze relations expressed by verb predicates or those expressed as nominalizations. However, sentences express relations via other linguistic phenomena as well. Furthermore, these phenomena interact with each other, thus restricting the structures they articulate. In this paper, we use this intuition to define a joint inference model that captures the inter-dependencies between verb semantic role labeling and relations expressed using prepositions. The scarcity of jointly labeled data presents a crucial technical challenge for learning a joint model. The key strength of our model is that we use existing structure predictors as black boxes. By enforcing consistency constraints between their predictions, we show improvements in the performance of both tasks without retraining the individual models.</p><p>3 0.18979833 <a title="145-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Hierarchical_Verb_Clustering_Using_Graph_Factorization.html">67 emnlp-2011-Hierarchical Verb Clustering Using Graph Factorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Lin Sun ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: Most previous research on verb clustering has focussed on acquiring flat classifications from corpus data, although many manually built classifications are taxonomic in nature. Also Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications benefit from taxonomic classifications because they vary in terms of the granularity they require from a classification. We introduce a new clustering method called Hierarchical Graph Factorization Clustering (HGFC) and extend it so that it is optimal for the task. Our results show that HGFC outperforms the frequently used agglomerative clustering on a hierarchical test set extracted from VerbNet, and that it yields state-of-the-art performance also on a flat test set. We demonstrate how the method can be used to acquire novel classifications as well as to extend existing ones on the basis of some prior knowledge about the classification.</p><p>4 0.15736511 <a title="145-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_generative_model_for_unsupervised_discovery_of_relations_and_argument_classes_from_clinical_texts.html">14 emnlp-2011-A generative model for unsupervised discovery of relations and argument classes from clinical texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Bryan Rink ; Sanda Harabagiu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a generative model for the automatic discovery of relations between entities in electronic medical records. The model discovers relation instances and their types by determining which context tokens express the relation. Additionally, the valid semantic classes for each type of relation are determined. We show that the model produces clusters of relation trigger words which better correspond with manually annotated relations than several existing clustering techniques. The discovered relations reveal some of the implicit semantic structure present in patient records.</p><p>5 0.1522525 <a title="145-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_without_Gold_Part-of-Speech_Tags.html">141 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Dependency Parsing without Gold Part-of-Speech Tags</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin I. Spitkovsky ; Hiyan Alshawi ; Angel X. Chang ; Daniel Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We show that categories induced by unsupervised word clustering can surpass the performance of gold part-of-speech tags in dependency grammar induction. Unlike classic clustering algorithms, our method allows a word to have different tags in different contexts. In an ablative analysis, we first demonstrate that this context-dependence is crucial to the superior performance of gold tags — requiring a word to always have the same part-ofspeech significantly degrades the performance of manual tags in grammar induction, eliminating the advantage that human annotation has over unsupervised tags. We then introduce a sequence modeling technique that combines the output of a word clustering algorithm with context-colored noise, to allow words to be tagged differently in different contexts. With these new induced tags as input, our state-of- the-art dependency grammar inducer achieves 59. 1% directed accuracy on Section 23 (all sentences) of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus — 0.7% higher than using gold tags.</p><p>6 0.14768073 <a title="145-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Structured_Relation_Discovery_using_Generative_Models.html">128 emnlp-2011-Structured Relation Discovery using Generative Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Kirk Roberts ; Sanda Harabagiu</p><p>Abstract: Metonymic language is a pervasive phenomenon. Metonymic type shifting, or argument type coercion, results in a selectional restriction violation where the argument’s semantic class differs from the class the predicate expects. In this paper we present an unsupervised method that learns the selectional restriction of arguments and enables the detection of argument coercion. This method also generates an enhanced probabilistic resolution of logical metonymies. The experimental results indicate substantial improvements the detection of coercions and the ranking of metonymic interpretations.</p><p>6 0.49877706 <a title="145-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Structured_Relation_Discovery_using_Generative_Models.html">128 emnlp-2011-Structured Relation Discovery using Generative Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Rui Yan ; Jian-Yun Nie ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Most traditional summarization methods treat their outputs as static and plain texts, which fail to capture user interests during summarization because the generated summaries are the same for different users. However, users have individual preferences on a particular source document collection and obviously a universal summary for all users might not always be satisfactory. Hence we investigate an important and challenging problem in summary generation, i.e., Interactive Personalized Summarization (IPS), which generates summaries in an interactive and personalized manner. Given the source documents, IPS captures user interests by enabling interactive clicks and incorporates personalization by modeling captured reader preference. We develop . experimental systems to compare 5 rival algorithms on 4 instinctively different datasets which amount to 5197 documents. Evaluation results in ROUGE metrics indicate the comparable performance between IPS and the best competing system but IPS produces summaries with much more user satisfaction according to evaluator ratings. Besides, low ROUGE consistency among these user preferred summaries indicates the existence of personalization.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81122816 <a title="145-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_with_Graph_Partitioning.html">145 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction with Graph Partitioning</a></p>

<p>Author: Rui Yan ; Liang Kong ; Congrui Huang ; Xiaojun Wan ; Xiaoming Li ; Yan Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We investigate an important and challenging problem in summary generation, i.e., Evolutionary Trans-Temporal Summarization (ETTS), which generates news timelines from massive data on the Internet. ETTS greatly facilitates fast news browsing and knowledge comprehension, and hence is a necessity. Given the collection oftime-stamped web documents related to the evolving news, ETTS aims to return news evolution along the timeline, consisting of individual but correlated summaries on each date. Existing summarization algorithms fail to utilize trans-temporal characteristics among these component summaries. We propose to model trans-temporal correlations among component summaries for timelines, using inter-date and intra-date sen- tence dependencies, and present a novel combination. We develop experimental systems to compare 5 rival algorithms on 6 instinctively different datasets which amount to 10251 documents. Evaluation results in ROUGE metrics indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on trans-temporal information. 1</p><p>4 0.71186566 <a title="145-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Learning_General_Connotation_of_Words_using_Graph-based_Algorithms.html">81 emnlp-2011-Learning General Connotation of Words using Graph-based Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Song Feng ; Ritwik Bose ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a connotation lexicon, a new type of lexicon that lists words with connotative polarity, i.e., words with positive connotation (e.g., award, promotion) and words with negative connotation (e.g., cancer, war). Connotation lexicons differ from much studied sentiment lexicons: the latter concerns words that express sentiment, while the former concerns words that evoke or associate with a specific polarity of sentiment. Understanding the connotation of words would seem to require common sense and world knowledge. However, we demonstrate that much of the connotative polarity of words can be inferred from natural language text in a nearly unsupervised manner. The key linguistic insight behind our approach is selectional preference of connotative predicates. We present graphbased algorithms using PageRank and HITS that collectively learn connotation lexicon together with connotative predicates. Our empirical study demonstrates that the resulting connotation lexicon is of great value for sentiment analysis complementing existing sentiment lexicons.</p><p>5 0.70189464 <a title="145-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Hierarchical_Verb_Clustering_Using_Graph_Factorization.html">67 emnlp-2011-Hierarchical Verb Clustering Using Graph Factorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Lin Sun ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: Most previous research on verb clustering has focussed on acquiring flat classifications from corpus data, although many manually built classifications are taxonomic in nature. Also Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications benefit from taxonomic classifications because they vary in terms of the granularity they require from a classification. We introduce a new clustering method called Hierarchical Graph Factorization Clustering (HGFC) and extend it so that it is optimal for the task. Our results show that HGFC outperforms the frequently used agglomerative clustering on a hierarchical test set extracted from VerbNet, and that it yields state-of-the-art performance also on a flat test set. We demonstrate how the method can be used to acquire novel classifications as well as to extend existing ones on the basis of some prior knowledge about the classification.</p><p>6 0.70106125 <a title="145-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Generate_and_Rank_Approach_to_Sentence_Paraphrasing.html">6 emnlp-2011-A Generate and Rank Approach to Sentence Paraphrasing</a></p>

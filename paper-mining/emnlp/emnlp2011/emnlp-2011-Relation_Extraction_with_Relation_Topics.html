<p>Author: Johannes Hoffart ; Mohamed Amir Yosef ; Ilaria Bordino ; Hagen Furstenau ; Manfred Pinkal ; Marc Spaniol ; Bilyana Taneva ; Stefan Thater ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: Disambiguating named entities in naturallanguage text maps mentions of ambiguous names onto canonical entities like people or places, registered in a knowledge base such as DBpedia or YAGO. This paper presents a robust method for collective disambiguation, by harnessing context from knowledge bases and using a new form of coherence graph. It unifies prior approaches into a comprehensive framework that combines three measures: the prior probability of an entity being mentioned, the similarity between the contexts of a mention and a candidate entity, as well as the coherence among candidate entities for all mentions together. The method builds a weighted graph of mentions and candidate entities, and computes a dense subgraph that approximates the best joint mention-entity mapping. Experiments show that the new method significantly outperforms prior methods in terms of accuracy, with robust behavior across a variety of inputs.</p><p>3 0.092803702 <a title="114-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Harnessing_different_knowledge_sources_to_measure_semantic_relatedness_under_a_uniform_model.html">64 emnlp-2011-Harnessing different knowledge sources to measure semantic relatedness under a uniform model</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziqi Zhang ; Anna Lisa Gentile ; Fabio Ciravegna</p><p>Abstract: Measuring semantic relatedness between words or concepts is a crucial process to many Natural Language Processing tasks. Exiting methods exploit semantic evidence from a single knowledge source, and are predominantly evaluated only in the general domain. This paper introduces a method of harnessing different knowledge sources under a uniform model for measuring semantic relatedness between words or concepts. Using Wikipedia and WordNet as examples, and evaluated in both the general and biomedical domains, it successfully combines strengths from both knowledge sources and outperforms stateof-the-art on many datasets.</p><p>4 0.078136213 <a title="114-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Structured_Relation_Discovery_using_Generative_Models.html">128 emnlp-2011-Structured Relation Discovery using Generative Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Aria Haghighi ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We explore unsupervised approaches to relation extraction between two named entities; for instance, the semantic bornIn relation between a person and location entity. Concretely, we propose a series of generative probabilistic models, broadly similar to topic models, each which generates a corpus of observed triples of entity mention pairs and the surface syntactic dependency path between them. The output of each model is a clustering of observed relation tuples and their associated textual expressions to underlying semantic relation types. Our proposed models exploit entity type constraints within a relation as well as features on the dependency path between entity mentions. We examine effectiveness of our approach via multiple evaluations and demonstrate 12% error reduction in precision over a state-of-the-art weakly supervised baseline.</p><p>5 0.075867712 <a title="114-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Using_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Structural_Kernels_for_Classifying_Definition_Questions_in_Jeopardy%21.html">147 emnlp-2011-Using Syntactic and Semantic Structural Kernels for Classifying Definition Questions in Jeopardy!</a></p>
<p>Author: Alessandro Moschitti ; Jennifer Chu-carroll ; Siddharth Patwardhan ; James Fan ; Giuseppe Riccardi</p><p>Abstract: The last decade has seen many interesting applications of Question Answering (QA) technology. The Jeopardy! quiz show is certainly one of the most fascinating, from the viewpoints of both its broad domain and the complexity of its language. In this paper, we study kernel methods applied to syntactic/semantic structures for accurate classification of Jeopardy! definition questions. Our extensive empirical analysis shows that our classification models largely improve on classifiers based on word-language models. Such classifiers are also used in the state-of-the-art QA pipeline constituting Watson, the IBM Jeopardy! system. Our experiments measuring their impact on Watson show enhancements in QA accuracy and a consequent increase in the amount of money earned in game-based evaluation.</p><p>6 0.068758234 <a title="114-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Joint_Model_for_Extended_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">7 emnlp-2011-A Joint Model for Extended Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>

Most previous work simplifies sentences using handcrafted rules aimed at splitting long sentences, or substitutes difficult words using a predefined dictionary. This paper presents a datadriven model based on quasi-synchronous grammar, a formalism that can naturally capture structural mismatches and complex rewrite operations. We describe how such a grammar can be induced from Wikipedia and propose an integer linear programming model for selecting the most appropriate simplification from the space of possible rewrites generated by the grammar.

<p>Author: Roy Bar-Haim ; Elad Dinur ; Ronen Feldman ; Moshe Fresko ; Guy Goldstein</p><p>Abstract: Information published in online stock investment message boards, and more recently in stock microblogs, is considered highly valuable by many investors. Previous work focused on aggregation of sentiment from all users. However, in this work we show that it is beneficial to distinguish expert users from non-experts. We propose a general framework for identifying expert investors, and use it as a basis for several models that predict stock rise from stock microblogging messages (stock tweets). In particular, we present two methods that combine expert identification and per-user unsupervised learning. These methods were shown to achieve relatively high precision in predicting stock rise, and significantly outperform our baseline. In addition, our work provides an in-depth analysis of the content and potential usefulness of stock tweets.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.64539421 <a title="114-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Relation_Extraction_with_Relation_Topics.html">114 emnlp-2011-Relation Extraction with Relation Topics</a></p>

<p>Author: Prodromos Malakasiotis ; Ion Androutsopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present a method that paraphrases a given sentence by first generating candidate paraphrases and then ranking (or classifying) them. The candidates are generated by applying existing paraphrasing rules extracted from parallel corpora. The ranking component considers not only the overall quality of the rules that produced each candidate, but also the extent to which they preserve grammaticality and meaning in the particular context of the input sentence, as well as the degree to which the candidate differs from the input. We experimented with both a Maximum Entropy classifier and an SVR ranker. Experimental results show that incorporating features from an existing paraphrase recognizer in the ranking component improves performance, and that our overall method compares well against a state of the art paraphrase generator, when paraphrasing rules apply to the input sentences. We also propose a new methodology to evaluate the ranking components of generate-and-rank paraphrase generators, which evaluates them across different combinations of weights for grammaticality, meaning preservation, and diversity. The paper is accompanied by a paraphrasing dataset we constructed for evaluations of this kind.</p><p>5 0.54245222 <a title="114-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Harnessing_different_knowledge_sources_to_measure_semantic_relatedness_under_a_uniform_model.html">64 emnlp-2011-Harnessing different knowledge sources to measure semantic relatedness under a uniform model</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziqi Zhang ; Anna Lisa Gentile ; Fabio Ciravegna</p><p>Abstract: Measuring semantic relatedness between words or concepts is a crucial process to many Natural Language Processing tasks. Exiting methods exploit semantic evidence from a single knowledge source, and are predominantly evaluated only in the general domain. This paper introduces a method of harnessing different knowledge sources under a uniform model for measuring semantic relatedness between words or concepts. Using Wikipedia and WordNet as examples, and evaluated in both the general and biomedical domains, it successfully combines strengths from both knowledge sources and outperforms stateof-the-art on many datasets.</p><p>6 0.54006392 <a title="114-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Robust_Disambiguation_of_Named_Entities_in_Text.html">116 emnlp-2011-Robust Disambiguation of Named Entities in Text</a></p>

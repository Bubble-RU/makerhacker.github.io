<p>Author: David Mimno ; Hanna Wallach ; Edmund Talley ; Miriam Leenders ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable models have the potential to add value to large document collections by discovering interpretable, low-dimensional subspaces. In order for people to use such models, however, they must trust them. Unfortunately, typical dimensionality reduction methods for text, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, often produce low-dimensional subspaces (topics) that are obviously flawed to human domain experts. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) An analysis of the ways in which topics can be flawed; (2) an automated evaluation metric for identifying such topics that does not rely on human annotators or reference collections outside the training data; (3) a novel statistical topic model based on this metric that significantly improves topic quality in a large-scale document collection from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p><p>3 0.15042087 <a title="21-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Semantic_Topic_Models%3A_Combining_Word_Distributional_Statistics_and_Dictionary_Definitions.html">119 emnlp-2011-Semantic Topic Models: Combining Word Distributional Statistics and Dictionary Definitions</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel topic model based on incorporating dictionary definitions. Traditional topic models treat words as surface strings without assuming predefined knowledge about word meaning. They infer topics only by observing surface word co-occurrence. However, the co-occurred words may not be semantically related in a manner that is relevant for topic coherence. Exploiting dictionary definitions explicitly in our model yields a better understanding of word semantics leading to better text modeling. We exploit WordNet as a lexical resource for sense definitions. We show that explicitly modeling word definitions helps improve performance significantly over the baseline for a text categorization task.</p><p>4 0.10478497 <a title="21-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Exploring_Supervised_LDA_Models_for_Assigning_Attributes_to_Adjective-Noun_Phrases.html">56 emnlp-2011-Exploring Supervised LDA Models for Assigning Attributes to Adjective-Noun Phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Hartung ; Anette Frank</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an attribute selection task as a way to characterize the inherent meaning of property-denoting adjectives in adjective-noun phrases, such as e.g. hot in hot summer denoting the attribute TEMPERATURE, rather than TASTE. We formulate this task in a vector space model that represents adjectives and nouns as vectors in a semantic space defined over possible attributes. The vectors incorporate latent semantic information obtained from two variants of LDA topic models. Our LDA models outperform previous approaches on a small set of 10 attributes with considerable gains on sparse representations, which highlights the strong smoothing power of LDA models. For the first time, we extend the attribute selection task to a new data set with more than 200 classes. We observe that large-scale attribute selection is a hard problem, but a subset of attributes performs robustly on the large scale as well. Again, the LDA models outperform the VSM baseline.</p><p>5 0.085724056 <a title="21-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Structure_Prediction_with_Non-Parallel_Multilingual_Guidance.html">146 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Structure Prediction with Non-Parallel Multilingual Guidance</a></p>
<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen ; Dipanjan Das ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method for prediction of linguistic structure in a language for which only unlabeled data is available, using annotated data from a set of one or more helper languages. Our approach is based on a model that locally mixes between supervised models from the helper languages. Parallel data is not used, allowing the technique to be applied even in domains where human-translated texts are unavailable. We obtain state-of-theart performance for two tasks of structure prediction: unsupervised part-of-speech tagging and unsupervised dependency parsing.</p><p>6 0.081974819 <a title="21-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Probabilistic_models_of_similarity_in_syntactic_context.html">107 emnlp-2011-Probabilistic models of similarity in syntactic context</a></p>

<p>Author: Joseph Reisinger ; Raymond Mooney</p><p>Abstract: Context-dependent word similarity can be measured over multiple cross-cutting dimensions. For example, lung and breath are similar thematically, while authoritative and superficial occur in similar syntactic contexts, but share little semantic similarity. Both of these notions of similarity play a role in determining word meaning, and hence lexical semantic models must take them both into account. Towards this end, we develop a novel model, Multi-View Mixture (MVM), that represents words as multiple overlapping clusterings. MVM finds multiple data partitions based on different subsets of features, subject to the marginal constraint that feature subsets are distributed according to Latent Dirich- let Allocation. Intuitively, this constraint favors feature partitions that have coherent topical semantics. Furthermore, MVM uses soft feature assignment, hence the contribution of each data point to each clustering view is variable, isolating the impact of data only to views where they assign the most features. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the utility of MVM as an inductive bias for capturing relations between words that are intuitive to humans, outperforming related models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation.</p><p>4 0.64397538 <a title="21-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Semantic_Topic_Models%3A_Combining_Word_Distributional_Statistics_and_Dictionary_Definitions.html">119 emnlp-2011-Semantic Topic Models: Combining Word Distributional Statistics and Dictionary Definitions</a></p>

Microsoft Research India IIT Bombay Bangalore damani @ cse . i . ac . in itb s laxman@mi cro s o ft . com of words that co-occur in a large number of docuLexical co-occurrence is an important cue for detecting word associations. We propose a new measure of word association based on a new notion of statistical significance for lexical co-occurrences. Existing measures typically rely on global unigram frequencies to determine expected co-occurrence counts. In- stead, we focus only on documents that contain both terms (of a candidate word-pair) and ask if the distribution of the observed spans of the word-pair resembles that under a random null model. This would imply that the words in the pair are not related strongly enough for one word to influence placement of the other. However, if the words are found to occur closer together than explainable by the null model, then we hypothesize a more direct association between the words. Through extensive empirical evaluation on most of the publicly available benchmark data sets, we show the advantages of our measure over existing co-occurrence measures.</p><p>6 0.44735652 <a title="21-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Exploring_Supervised_LDA_Models_for_Assigning_Attributes_to_Adjective-Noun_Phrases.html">56 emnlp-2011-Exploring Supervised LDA Models for Assigning Attributes to Adjective-Noun Phrases</a></p>

<p>Author: Christos Christodoulopoulos ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a fully unsupervised syntactic class induction system formulated as a Bayesian multinomial mixture model, where each word type is constrained to belong to a single class. By using a mixture model rather than a sequence model (e.g., HMM), we are able to easily add multiple kinds of features, including those at both the type level (morphology features) and token level (context and alignment features, the latter from parallel corpora). Using only context features, our system yields results comparable to state-of-the art, far better than a similar model without the one-class-per-type constraint. Using the additional features provides added benefit, and our final system outperforms the best published results on most of the 25 corpora tested.</p><p>3 0.99719071 <a title="21-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Multi-Source_Transfer_of_Delexicalized_Dependency_Parsers.html">95 emnlp-2011-Multi-Source Transfer of Delexicalized Dependency Parsers</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan McDonald ; Slav Petrov ; Keith Hall</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple method for transferring dependency parsers from source languages with labeled training data to target languages without labeled training data. We first demonstrate that delexicalized parsers can be directly transferred between languages, producing significantly higher accuracies than unsupervised parsers. We then use a constraint driven learning algorithm where constraints are drawn from parallel corpora to project the final parser. Unlike previous work on projecting syntactic resources, we show that simple methods for introducing multiple source lan- guages can significantly improve the overall quality of the resulting parsers. The projected parsers from our system result in state-of-theart performance when compared to previously studied unsupervised and projected parsing systems across eight different languages.</p><p>4 0.99603295 <a title="21-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Fast_and_Robust_Joint_Models_for_Biomedical_Event_Extraction.html">59 emnlp-2011-Fast and Robust Joint Models for Biomedical Event Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Extracting biomedical events from literature has attracted much recent attention. The bestperforming systems so far have been pipelines of simple subtask-specific local classifiers. A natural drawback of such approaches are cascading errors introduced in early stages of the pipeline. We present three joint models of increasing complexity designed to overcome this problem. The first model performs joint trigger and argument extraction, and lends itself to a simple, efficient and exact inference algorithm. The second model captures correlations between events, while the third model ensures consistency between arguments of the same event. Inference in these models is kept tractable through dual decomposition. The first two models outperform the previous best joint approaches and are very competitive with respect to the current state-of-theart. The third model yields the best results reported so far on the BioNLP 2009 shared task, the BioNLP 2011 Genia task and the BioNLP 2011Infectious Diseases task.</p><p>5 0.99592227 <a title="21-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Fast_Re-scoring_Strategy_to_Capture_Long-Distance_Dependencies.html">5 emnlp-2011-A Fast Re-scoring Strategy to Capture Long-Distance Dependencies</a></p>
<p>Author: Anoop Deoras ; Tomas Mikolov ; Kenneth Church</p><p>Abstract: A re-scoring strategy is proposed that makes it feasible to capture more long-distance dependencies in the natural language. Two pass strategies have become popular in a number of recognition tasks such as ASR (automatic speech recognition), MT (machine translation) and OCR (optical character recognition). The first pass typically applies a weak language model (n-grams) to a lattice and the second pass applies a stronger language model to N best lists. The stronger language model is intended to capture more longdistance dependencies. The proposed method uses RNN-LM (recurrent neural network language model), which is a long span LM, to rescore word lattices in the second pass. A hill climbing method (iterative decoding) is proposed to search over islands of confusability in the word lattice. An evaluation based on Broadcast News shows speedups of 20 over basic N best re-scoring, and word error rate reduction of 8% (relative) on a highly competitive setup.</p><p>6 0.99504495 <a title="21-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_without_Gold_Part-of-Speech_Tags.html">141 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Dependency Parsing without Gold Part-of-Speech Tags</a></p>

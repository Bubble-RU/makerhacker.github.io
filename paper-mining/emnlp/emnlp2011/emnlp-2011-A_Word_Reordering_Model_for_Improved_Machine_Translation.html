</p><p>3 Instead of using a parser and then using rules to order the source side sentence we learn a model that can directly reorder source side sentences to match target word order using a small parallel corpus with highquality word alignments. [sent-13, score-0.596]
</p><p>4 We use the Lin-Kernighan heuristic to find the best source reordering efficiently during training and testing and show that it suffices to provide good quality reordering. [sent-15, score-0.679]
</p><p>5 We show gains in translation performance based on our reordering model for translating from Hindi to English, Urdu to English (with a public dataset), and English to Hindi. [sent-16, score-0.631]
</p><p>6 Machine translation systems need to reorder words in the source sentence to produce fluent output in the 486 Jiri Navratil IBM T. [sent-19, score-0.312]
</p><p>7 Even the capturing of these local reordering phenomena is constrained by the amount of training data available. [sent-25, score-0.61]
</p><p>8 For example, if adjectives precede nouns in the source language and follow nouns in the target language we still need to see a particular adjective noun pair in the parallel corpus to handle the reordering via the phrase table. [sent-26, score-0.734]
</p><p>9 While these models are simple, and can be integrated with the decoder they are insufficient to capture long-range reordering phenomena especially for language pairs that differ significantly. [sent-32, score-0.646]
</p><p>10 The weakness of these simple distortion models has been overcome using syntax of either the source or target sentence (Yamada and Knight, 2002; Galley et al. [sent-33, score-0.244]
</p><p>11 Another approach that overcomes this weakness, is to to reorder the source sentence based on rules applied on the source parse (either hand written or learned from data) both when training and testing (Collins et al. [sent-39, score-0.391]
</p><p>12 Words are the cities in the TSP and the objective is to learn the distance between words so that the shortest tour corresponds to the ordering of the words in the source sentence in the target language. [sent-45, score-0.245]
</p><p>13 We show experimentally that our reordering model, even when used to reorder sentences for training and testing (rather than being used as an additional score in the decoder) improves machine translation performance for: Hindi → English, En-  glish → Hindi, aonrdm aUnrcdeu → English. [sent-49, score-0.809]
</p><p>14 reordering phenomena we include it in our experiments since there are publicly available datasets for Urdu-English. [sent-51, score-0.61]

</p><p>16 Section 3 outlines reordering issues due to syntactic differences between Hindi and English. [sent-55, score-0.57]
</p><p>17 487 Section 4 presents our reordering model, Section 5 presents experimental results and Section 6 presents our conclusions and possible future work. [sent-56, score-0.57]
</p><p>18 2  Related work  There have been several studies demonstrating improved machine translation performance by reordering source side sentences based on rules applied to the source side parse during training and decoding. [sent-57, score-1.03]
</p><p>19 , 2006) which uses source and/or target side syntax in a Context Free Grammar framework which results in machine translation decoding being considered as a parsing problem. [sent-69, score-0.35]
</p><p>20 In this paper we propose a model that does not require either source or target side syntax while also preserving the efficiency of reordering techniques based on rules applied to the source side parse. [sent-70, score-1.026]
</p><p>21 In work that is closely related to ours, (Tromble and Eisner, 2009) formulated word reordering as a Linear Ordering Problem (LOP), an NP-hard permutation problem. [sent-71, score-0.607]
</p><p>22 the translation, distortion and language model probabilities) we learn model weights to reorder source sentences to match target word order using an informative feature set  adapted from graph-based dependency parsing (McDonald et al. [sent-82, score-0.384]
</p><p>23 3  Hindi-English reordering issues  This section provides a brief survey of constructions that the two languages in question differ as well as have in common. [sent-84, score-0.57]
</p><p>24 Our reordering model assigns costs to candidate permutations as: C(π|w)  =Xc(πi−1,πi). [sent-102, score-0.625]
</p><p>25 Given a source sentence w we reorder it according to the permutation π that minimizes the cost  C(π|w) . [sent-105, score-0.288]
</p><p>26 Thus, we would like our cost function C(π|w) to be such that the correct reordering π∗ has tChe(π πl|owwe)s tot c boest s uocfh ha tllh possible reorderings π. [sent-106, score-0.646]
</p><p>27 2 we describe how we train the weights θ to obtain a good reordering model. [sent-109, score-0.57]
</p><p>28 Consider the following example: English input: John eats apples Hindi: John seba(apples) khaataa hai(eats) Desired reordered English: John apples eats The ATSP that we need to solve is represented pictorially in Figure 1 with sample costs. [sent-111, score-0.489]
</p><p>29 We start and end the tour at node 0, and this determines the first word in the reordered sentence. [sent-113, score-0.275]
</p><p>30 In this example the minimum cost tour is: Start → John → apple → eats recovering hthne → right reordering for translation into Hindi. [sent-114, score-0.76]
</p><p>31 Solving the ATSP (which is a well known NP hard problem) efficiently is crucial for the efficiency of our reordering model. [sent-115, score-0.57]
</p><p>32 Following (Hornik and  N0  Figure 1: Example of an ATSP for reordering the sentence: John eats apples. [sent-120, score-0.655]
</p><p>33 Overall, this means that our reordering model is as fast as parsing and hence our model is compara-  c0(A,  =A0) ∞  c0(A, B0)  c0(B0,  ble in performance to techniques based on applying rules to the parse tree. [sent-123, score-0.601]
</p><p>34 1 Features Since we would like to model reordering phenomena which are largely related to analyzing the syntax of the source sentence, we chose to use features based on those that have in the past been used for parsing (McDonald et al. [sent-125, score-0.757]
</p><p>35 A subset of the features we use was also used for reordering in (Tromble and Eisner, 2009). [sent-127, score-0.57]
</p><p>36 These features depend only on the identities of the word and POS tag of the two positions iand j and we call 489  Table 1: Bigram feature templates used to calculate the cost that word at position iimmediately precedes word at position j in the target word order. [sent-131, score-0.302]
</p><p>37 Each of the templates is also conjoined with i-j the signed distance between the two words in the source sentence. [sent-133, score-0.244]
</p><p>38 Since Hindi is verb final, in Hindi sentences with multiple verb groups it is rare for words with a verb in between to be placed together in the reordering to match English. [sent-141, score-0.606]
</p><p>39 Each of the templates described in Table 1 and Table 2 is also conjoined with i-j the signed distance between the two words in the source sentence. [sent-143, score-0.244]
</p><p>40 Each of the templates is also conjoined with i-j the signed distance between the two positions in the source sentence. [sent-151, score-0.299]
</p><p>41 types for the task of reordering Hindi sentences to be in English word order. [sent-152, score-0.606]
</p><p>42 2 Training To train the weights θ in our model, we need a collection of sentences, where we have the desired reference reordering π∗ (x) for each input sentence x. [sent-154, score-0.666]
</p><p>43 The quality and consistency of these reference reorderings will depend on the quality of the word alignments that we use. [sent-156, score-0.263]
</p><p>44 Given word aligned source and target sentences, we drop the source words that are not aligned. [sent-157, score-0.339]
</p><p>45 Let mi be the mean of the target word positions that the source word at index iis aligned to. [sent-158, score-0.285]
</p><p>46 πˆ = argπminC(π|x) is the best reordering based on the current parameter value and L is a loss function. [sent-166, score-0.57]
</p><p>47 We take the loss of a reordering to be the number of words for which the preceding word is wrong relative to the reference target order. [sent-167, score-0.685]
</p><p>48 5 Experiments In this section we report on experiments to evaluate our reordering model. [sent-169, score-0.57]
</p><p>49 The first method we use for evaluation (monolingual BLEU) is by generating the desired reordering of the source sentence (as described in Section 4. [sent-170, score-0.715]
</p><p>50 2) and compare the reordered output to this desired reordered sentence using the BLEU metric. [sent-171, score-0.498]
</p><p>51 5) the reordering by its effect on eventual machine translation performance. [sent-173, score-0.631]
</p><p>52 We note that our reordering techniques uses POS information for the input sentence. [sent-174, score-0.57]
</p><p>53 1 Reordering model training data and alignment quality  To train our reordering models we need training data where we have the input source language sentence and the desired reordering in the target language. [sent-180, score-1.34]
</p><p>54 2 we derive the reference reordered sentence using word alignments. [sent-182, score-0.291]
</p><p>55 Table 3 presents our monolingual BLEU results for Hindi to English reordering as the source of the word alignments is varied. [sent-183, score-0.847]
</p><p>56 We have word alignments from three sources: A small set of hand aligned sentences, HMM alignments (Vogel et al. [sent-185, score-0.32]
</p><p>57 We see that the quality of the alignments is an important determiner of reordering performance. [sent-188, score-0.697]
</p><p>58 Row 1 shows the BLEU for unreordered (baseline) Hindi compared with the Hindi sentences reordered in English Order. [sent-189, score-0.301]
</p><p>59 Although using the Maximum Entropy alignments is better than using HMM alignments, we do not im-  prove upon a small number of hand alignments by using all the Maximum Entropy alignments. [sent-191, score-0.254]
</p><p>60 The heuristic we used in the selection of snippets was to pick maximal snippets of at least 7 consecutive Hindi words with all Hindi words aligned to a consecutive span of English words, with no unaligned English words in the span and no English words aligned to Hindi words outside the span. [sent-194, score-0.27]
</p><p>61 Adding snippets selected with this heuristic improves the reordering performance of our model as seen in the last row of Table 3. [sent-195, score-0.639]
</p><p>62 830UEn-  glish reordering using models trained with different feature sets and tested on a development set of 280 Hindi sentences (5590 tokens). [sent-199, score-0.606]
</p><p>63 3 Monolingual reordering comparisons Table 5 compares our reordering model with a reimplementation of the reordering model proposed in (Tromble and Eisner, 2009). [sent-206, score-1.71]
</p><p>64 To generate our training data, for Hindi to English and English to Hindi we use a set of 6000 hand aligned sentences, for Urdu to English we use a set of 8500 hand aligned sentences and for English to French we use a set of 10000 hand aligned sentences (a subset of Europarl and Hansards corpus). [sent-208, score-0.27]
</p><p>65 P7r02ig-  inal source order with desired target reorder without reordering, and reordering using our model (TSP) and the model proposed in (Tromble and Eisner, 2009) (LOP). [sent-212, score-0.912]
</p><p>66 We include English-French here to compare on a fairly similar language pair with local reordering phenomena (the main difference being that in French adjectives generally follow nouns). [sent-214, score-0.61]
</p><p>67 The following analysis is for Hindi to English reordering with the best model (this is also the model used for Machine Translation experiments reported on in Section 5. [sent-218, score-0.57]
</p><p>68 52 sentences were reordered by the model to match the order of the corresponding reference. [sent-226, score-0.267]
</p><p>69 For example, the following sentence with two subjects and objects corresponding to the verb wearing has not been reordered correctly. [sent-233, score-0.26]
</p><p>70 po-  ing) safeda3 (white) evama4 (and) mahilaaen5 (women) kesariyaa6 (saffron)  English: All men were wearing white and the women saffron The model possibly needs more data with patterns that deviate from the standard SOV order to learn to reorder them correctly. [sent-235, score-0.351]
</p><p>71 •  Local reordering: To estimate the short range reordering performance, we tceon thsied sehro hrot wra nogfeten different POS bigrams in the input are reordered correctly. [sent-243, score-0.801]
</p><p>72 Here, we expect the model to reorder prepositions correctly, and to avoid any reordering that moves apart nouns and their adjectival pre-modifiers or components of compound nouns (see Section 3). [sent-244, score-0.712]
</p><p>73 Table 6 summarizes the reordering performance for these categories for a set of 280 sentences (same as the test set used in Section 5. [sent-245, score-0.606]
</p><p>74 , the number of instances of the pair in the reference (column titled Total), the number of instances that already appear in the correct order in the input  (column Input), and the number that are ordered correctly by the reordering model (column Reordered). [sent-249, score-0.63]
</p><p>75 The same problem in the training data would also adversely impact the learning of the preposition reordering rule. [sent-255, score-0.57]
</p><p>76 5  Machine translation results  We now present experiments in incorporating the reordering model in machine translation systems. [sent-257, score-0.692]
</p><p>77 For all results presented here, we reorder the training and test data using the single best reordering based on our reordering model for each sentence. [sent-258, score-1.282]
</p><p>78 For each of the language pairs we evaluated, we trained Direct Translation Model 2 (DTM) systems (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007) with and without reordering and compared performance on test data. [sent-259, score-0.57]
</p><p>79 We note that the DTM system includes features that allow it to model lexicalized reordering phenomena. [sent-260, score-0.57]
</p><p>80 The reordering window size was set to +/-8 words for both the baseline and our reordered input. [sent-261, score-0.801]
</p><p>81 e we reordered the existing word alignments rather than realigning the sentences after reordering. [sent-263, score-0.394]
</p><p>82 To train our reordering model, we used roughly 6K alignments plus 17K snippets selected from MaxEnt alignments as described in Section 5. [sent-275, score-0.925]
</p><p>83 The monolingual reordering BLEU (on the same data reported on in Section 5. [sent-277, score-0.611]
</p><p>84 o587rde ing  (baseline) compared with performance after preordering with our reordering model. [sent-283, score-0.614]
</p><p>85 To train the reordering model we used 9K hand alignments and 11K snippets extracted from MaxEnt alignments as described in Section 5. [sent-288, score-0.893]
</p><p>86 The monolingual reordering BLEU for the reordering model thus obtained (on the same data reported on in Section 5. [sent-290, score-1.181]
</p><p>87 , 2010)) applied to a parse to reorder source side English sentences. [sent-296, score-0.308]
</p><p>88 2, which is an improvement over the baseline, but our reordering model is better by 1. [sent-298, score-0.57]
</p><p>89 An added benefit of our reordering model is that the decoder can be run with a smaller search space exploring only a small amount of reordering without losing accuracy but running substantially faster. [sent-300, score-1.176]
</p><p>90 6  Conclusion and future work  In this paper we presented a reordering model to reorder source language data to make it resemble the target language word order without using either a source or target parser. [sent-305, score-1.04]
</p><p>91 We show better performance compared to syntax based reordering rules for English to Hindi translation. [sent-307, score-0.639]
</p><p>92 Considering the fact that treebanks required to build high quality parsers are costly to obtain, we think that our reordering model is a viable alterna-  tive to using syntax for reordering. [sent-309, score-0.608]
</p><p>93 We also note, that with the preordering based on our reordering model we can achieve the best BLEU scores with a much tighter search space in the decoder. [sent-310, score-0.614]
</p><p>94 Even accounting for the cost of finding the best reordering according to our model, this usually results in faster processing than if we did not have the reordering in place. [sent-311, score-1.14]
</p><p>95 We would like to investigate the use of other loss functions and their effect on reordering performance. [sent-315, score-0.57]
</p><p>96 We also would like to explore whether the use of scores from our reordering model directly in machine translation systems can improve performance relative to using just the single best reordering. [sent-316, score-0.631]

We apply our method to train parsers that excel when used as part of a reordering component in a statistical machine translation system.

<p>Author: Yang Gao ; Philipp Koehn ; Alexandra Birch</p><p>Abstract: Long-distance reordering remains one of the biggest challenges facing machine translation. We derive soft constraints from the source dependency parsing to directly address the reordering problem for the hierarchical phrasebased model.

<p>Author: John DeNero ; Jakob Uszkoreit</p><p>Abstract: When translating among languages that differ substantially in word order, machine translation (MT) systems benefit from syntactic preordering—an approach that uses features from a syntactic parse to permute source words into a target-language-like order. This paper presents a method for inducing parse trees automatically from a parallel corpus, instead of using a supervised parser trained on a treebank. These induced parses are used to preorder source sentences. We demonstrate that our induced parser is effective: it not only improves a state-of-the-art phrase-based system with integrated reordering, but also approaches the performance of a recent preordering method based on a supervised parser. These results show that the syntactic structure which is relevant to MT pre-ordering can be learned automatically from parallel text, thus establishing a new application for unsupervised grammar induction.</p><p>5 0.16955915 <a title="13-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_dependency_parsers_by_jointly_optimizing_multiple_objectives.html">137 emnlp-2011-Training dependency parsers by jointly optimizing multiple objectives</a></p>

<p>Author: Karthik Visweswariah ; Rajakrishnan Rajkumar ; Ankur Gandhe ; Ananthakrishnan Ramanathan ; Jiri Navratil</p><p>Abstract: Preordering of source side sentences has proved to be useful in improving statistical machine translation. Most work has used a parser in the source language along with rules to map the source language word order into the target language word order. The requirement to have a source language parser is a major drawback, which we seek to overcome in this paper. Instead of using a parser and then using rules to order the source side sentence we learn a model that can directly reorder source side sentences to match target word order using a small parallel corpus with highquality word alignments. Our model learns pairwise costs of a word immediately preced- ing another word. We use the Lin-Kernighan heuristic to find the best source reordering efficiently during training and testing and show that it suffices to provide good quality reordering. We show gains in translation performance based on our reordering model for translating from Hindi to English, Urdu to English (with a public dataset), and English to Hindi. For English to Hindi we show that our technique achieves better performance than a method that uses rules applied to the source side English parse.</p><p>2 0.83117008 <a title="13-lsi-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_a_Parser_for_Machine_Translation_Reordering.html">136 emnlp-2011-Training a Parser for Machine Translation Reordering</a></p>

We apply our method to train parsers that excel when used as part of a reordering component in a statistical machine translation system. We use a corpus of weakly-labeled reference reorderings to guide parser training. Our best parsers contribute significant improvements in subjective translation quality while their intrinsic attachment scores typically regress.</p><p>3 0.82464987 <a title="13-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Inducing_Sentence_Structure_from_Parallel_Corpora_for_Reordering.html">74 emnlp-2011-Inducing Sentence Structure from Parallel Corpora for Reordering</a></p>

As these sentences are not themselves identical to the in-domain data, we call them pseudo in-domain subcorpora. These subcorpora 1% the size of the original can then used to train small domain-adapted Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems which outperform systems trained on the entire corpus. Performance is further improved when we use these domain-adapted models in combination with a true in-domain model.

Word aligners that model the alignment matrix can express arbitrary alignments, but are difficult to decode. We propose an alignment matrix model as a correction algorithm to an underlying sequencebased aligner. Then a greedy decoding algorithm enables the full expressive power of the alignment matrix formulation. Improved alignment performance is shown for all nine language pairs tested. The improved alignments also improved translation quality from Chinese to English and English to Italian.</p><p>5 0.45511749 <a title="13-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Language_Models_for_Machine_Translation%3A_Original_vs._Translated_Texts.html">76 emnlp-2011-Language Models for Machine Translation: Original vs. Translated Texts</a></p>

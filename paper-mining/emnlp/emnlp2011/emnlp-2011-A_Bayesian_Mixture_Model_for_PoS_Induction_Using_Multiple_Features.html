<p>Author: Young-Bum Kim ; Joao Graca ; Benjamin Snyder</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of unsupervised morphological analysis from a new angle. Past work has endeavored to design unsupervised learning methods which explicitly or implicitly encode inductive biases appropriate to the task at hand. We propose instead to treat morphological analysis as a structured prediction problem, where languages with labeled data serve as training examples for unlabeled languages, without the assumption of parallel data. We define a universal morphological feature space in which every language and its morphological analysis reside. We develop a novel structured nearest neighbor prediction method which seeks to find the morphological analysis for each unlabeled lan- guage which lies as close as possible in the feature space to a training language. We apply our model to eight inflecting languages, and induce nominal morphology with substantially higher accuracy than a traditional, MDLbased approach. Our analysis indicates that accuracy continues to improve substantially as the number of training languages increases.</p><p>3 0.22837871 <a title="1-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Structure_Prediction_with_Non-Parallel_Multilingual_Guidance.html">146 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Structure Prediction with Non-Parallel Multilingual Guidance</a></p>
<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen ; Dipanjan Das ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method for prediction of linguistic structure in a language for which only unlabeled data is available, using annotated data from a set of one or more helper languages. Our approach is based on a model that locally mixes between supervised models from the helper languages. Parallel data is not used, allowing the technique to be applied even in domains where human-translated texts are unavailable. We obtain state-of-theart performance for two tasks of structure prediction: unsupervised part-of-speech tagging and unsupervised dependency parsing.</p><p>4 0.20964761 <a title="1-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Correction_Model_for_Word_Alignments.html">3 emnlp-2011-A Correction Model for Word Alignments</a></p>
<p>Author: J. Scott McCarley ; Abraham Ittycheriah ; Salim Roukos ; Bing Xiang ; Jian-ming Xu</p><p>Abstract: Models of word alignment built as sequences of links have limited expressive power, but are easy to decode. Word aligners that model the alignment matrix can express arbitrary alignments, but are difficult to decode. We propose an alignment matrix model as a correction algorithm to an underlying sequencebased aligner. Then a greedy decoding algorithm enables the full expressive power of the alignment matrix formulation. Improved alignment performance is shown for all nine language pairs tested. The improved alignments also improved translation quality from Chinese to English and English to Italian.</p><p>5 0.17896074 <a title="1-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Non-parametric_Bayesian_Segmentation_of_Japanese_Noun_Phrases.html">99 emnlp-2011-Non-parametric Bayesian Segmentation of Japanese Noun Phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Yugo Murawaki ; Sadao Kurohashi</p><p>Abstract: A key factor of high quality word segmentation for Japanese is a high-coverage dictionary, but it is costly to manually build such a lexical resource. Although external lexical resources for human readers are potentially good knowledge sources, they have not been utilized due to differences in segmentation criteria. To supplement a morphological dictionary with these resources, we propose a new task of Japanese noun phrase segmentation. We apply non-parametric Bayesian language models to segment each noun phrase in these resources according to the statistical behavior of its supposed constituents in text. For inference, we propose a novel block sampling procedure named hybrid type-based sampling, which has the ability to directly escape a local optimum that is not too distant from the global optimum. Experiments show that the proposed method efficiently corrects the initial segmentation given by a morphological ana- lyzer.</p><p>6 0.14401412 <a title="1-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_without_Gold_Part-of-Speech_Tags.html">141 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Dependency Parsing without Gold Part-of-Speech Tags</a></p>

<p>Author: Markus Dreyer ; Jason Eisner</p><p>Abstract: We present an inference algorithm that organizes observed words (tokens) into structured inflectional paradigms (types). It also naturally predicts the spelling of unobserved forms that are missing from these paradigms, and discovers inflectional principles (grammar) that generalize to wholly unobserved words. Our Bayesian generative model of the data explicitly represents tokens, types, inflections, paradigms, and locally conditioned string edits. It assumes that inflected word tokens are generated from an infinite mixture of inflectional paradigms (string tuples). Each paradigm is sampled all at once from a graphical model, whose potential functions are weighted finitestate transducers with language-specific parameters to be learned. These assumptions naturally lead to an elegant empirical Bayes inference procedure that exploits Monte Carlo EM, belief propagation, and dynamic programming. Given 50–100 seed paradigms, adding a 10million-word corpus reduces prediction error for morphological inflections by up to 10%.</p><p>6 0.44812962 <a title="1-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Non-parametric_Bayesian_Segmentation_of_Japanese_Noun_Phrases.html">99 emnlp-2011-Non-parametric Bayesian Segmentation of Japanese Noun Phrases</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryan McDonald ; Slav Petrov ; Keith Hall</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple method for transferring dependency parsers from source languages with labeled training data to target languages without labeled training data. We first demonstrate that delexicalized parsers can be directly transferred between languages, producing significantly higher accuracies than unsupervised parsers. We then use a constraint driven learning algorithm where constraints are drawn from parallel corpora to project the final parser. Unlike previous work on projecting syntactic resources, we show that simple methods for introducing multiple source lan- guages can significantly improve the overall quality of the resulting parsers. The projected parsers from our system result in state-of-theart performance when compared to previously studied unsupervised and projected parsing systems across eight different languages.</p><p>4 0.99758434 <a title="1-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Fast_Re-scoring_Strategy_to_Capture_Long-Distance_Dependencies.html">5 emnlp-2011-A Fast Re-scoring Strategy to Capture Long-Distance Dependencies</a></p>
<p>Author: Anoop Deoras ; Tomas Mikolov ; Kenneth Church</p><p>Abstract: A re-scoring strategy is proposed that makes it feasible to capture more long-distance dependencies in the natural language. Two pass strategies have become popular in a number of recognition tasks such as ASR (automatic speech recognition), MT (machine translation) and OCR (optical character recognition). The first pass typically applies a weak language model (n-grams) to a lattice and the second pass applies a stronger language model to N best lists. The stronger language model is intended to capture more longdistance dependencies. The proposed method uses RNN-LM (recurrent neural network language model), which is a long span LM, to rescore word lattices in the second pass. A hill climbing method (iterative decoding) is proposed to search over islands of confusability in the word lattice. An evaluation based on Broadcast News shows speedups of 20 over basic N best re-scoring, and word error rate reduction of 8% (relative) on a highly competitive setup.</p><p>5 0.99744695 <a title="1-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Fast_and_Robust_Joint_Models_for_Biomedical_Event_Extraction.html">59 emnlp-2011-Fast and Robust Joint Models for Biomedical Event Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Extracting biomedical events from literature has attracted much recent attention. The bestperforming systems so far have been pipelines of simple subtask-specific local classifiers. A natural drawback of such approaches are cascading errors introduced in early stages of the pipeline. We present three joint models of increasing complexity designed to overcome this problem. The first model performs joint trigger and argument extraction, and lends itself to a simple, efficient and exact inference algorithm. The second model captures correlations between events, while the third model ensures consistency between arguments of the same event. Inference in these models is kept tractable through dual decomposition. The first two models outperform the previous best joint approaches and are very competitive with respect to the current state-of-theart. The third model yields the best results reported so far on the BioNLP 2009 shared task, the BioNLP 2011 Genia task and the BioNLP 2011Infectious Diseases task.</p><p>6 0.99647492 <a title="1-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_without_Gold_Part-of-Speech_Tags.html">141 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Dependency Parsing without Gold Part-of-Speech Tags</a></p>

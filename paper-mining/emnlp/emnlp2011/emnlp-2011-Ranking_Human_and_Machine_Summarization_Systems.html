<p>Author: Rui Yan ; Jian-Yun Nie ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Most traditional summarization methods treat their outputs as static and plain texts, which fail to capture user interests during summarization because the generated summaries are the same for different users. However, users have individual preferences on a particular source document collection and obviously a universal summary for all users might not always be satisfactory. Hence we investigate an important and challenging problem in summary generation, i.e., Interactive Personalized Summarization (IPS), which generates summaries in an interactive and personalized manner. Given the source documents, IPS captures user interests by enabling interactive clicks and incorporates personalization by modeling captured reader preference. We develop . experimental systems to compare 5 rival algorithms on 4 instinctively different datasets which amount to 5197 documents. Evaluation results in ROUGE metrics indicate the comparable performance between IPS and the best competing system but IPS produces summaries with much more user satisfaction according to evaluator ratings. Besides, low ROUGE consistency among these user preferred summaries indicates the existence of personalization.</p><p>4 0.078932621 <a title="110-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Timeline_Generation_through_Evolutionary_Trans-Temporal_Summarization.html">135 emnlp-2011-Timeline Generation through Evolutionary Trans-Temporal Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Yan ; Liang Kong ; Congrui Huang ; Xiaojun Wan ; Xiaoming Li ; Yan Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We investigate an important and challenging problem in summary generation, i.e., Evolutionary Trans-Temporal Summarization (ETTS), which generates news timelines from massive data on the Internet. ETTS greatly facilitates fast news browsing and knowledge comprehension, and hence is a necessity. Given the collection oftime-stamped web documents related to the evolving news, ETTS aims to return news evolution along the timeline, consisting of individual but correlated summaries on each date. Existing summarization algorithms fail to utilize trans-temporal characteristics among these component summaries. We propose to model trans-temporal correlations among component summaries for timelines, using inter-date and intra-date sen- tence dependencies, and present a novel combination. We develop experimental systems to compare 5 rival algorithms on 6 instinctively different datasets which amount to 10251 documents. Evaluation results in ROUGE metrics indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on trans-temporal information. 1</p><p>5 0.072099835 <a title="110-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Fast_Re-scoring_Strategy_to_Capture_Long-Distance_Dependencies.html">5 emnlp-2011-A Fast Re-scoring Strategy to Capture Long-Distance Dependencies</a></p>
<p>Author: Anoop Deoras ; Tomas Mikolov ; Kenneth Church</p><p>Abstract: A re-scoring strategy is proposed that makes it feasible to capture more long-distance dependencies in the natural language. Two pass strategies have become popular in a number of recognition tasks such as ASR (automatic speech recognition), MT (machine translation) and OCR (optical character recognition). The first pass typically applies a weak language model (n-grams) to a lattice and the second pass applies a stronger language model to N best lists. The stronger language model is intended to capture more longdistance dependencies. The proposed method uses RNN-LM (recurrent neural network language model), which is a long span LM, to rescore word lattices in the second pass. A hill climbing method (iterative decoding) is proposed to search over islands of confusability in the word lattice. An evaluation based on Broadcast News shows speedups of 20 over basic N best re-scoring, and word error rate reduction of 8% (relative) on a highly competitive setup.</p><p>6 0.071912043 <a title="110-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Generating_Aspect-oriented_Multi-Document_Summarization_with_Event-aspect_model.html">61 emnlp-2011-Generating Aspect-oriented Multi-Document Summarization with Event-aspect model</a></p>

We propose a new measure of word association based on a new notion of statistical significance for lexical co-occurrences. Existing measures typically rely on global unigram frequencies to determine expected co-occurrence counts. In- stead, we focus only on documents that contain both terms (of a candidate word-pair) and ask if the distribution of the observed spans of the word-pair resembles that under a random null model. This would imply that the words in the pair are not related strongly enough for one word to influence placement of the other. However, if the words are found to occur closer together than explainable by the null model, then we hypothesize a more direct association between the words. Through extensive empirical evaluation on most of the publicly available benchmark data sets, we show the advantages of our measure over existing co-occurrence measures.</p><p>4 0.50036597 <a title="110-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Timeline_Generation_through_Evolutionary_Trans-Temporal_Summarization.html">135 emnlp-2011-Timeline Generation through Evolutionary Trans-Temporal Summarization</a></p>

<p>Author: Lanjun Zhou ; Binyang Li ; Wei Gao ; Zhongyu Wei ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of opinionated sentences with both positive and negative sentiments1 is a key challenge in sentiment analysis. This paper presents a novel unsupervised method for discovering intra-sentence level discourse relations for eliminating polarity ambiguities. Firstly, a discourse scheme with discourse constraints on polarity was defined empirically based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, a small set of cuephrase-based patterns were utilized to collect a large number of discourse instances which were later converted to semantic sequential representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsupervised method was adopted to generate, weigh and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for recognizing discourse relations. Experimental results showed that the proposed methods not only effectively recognized the defined discourse relations but also achieved significant improvement by integrating discourse information in sentence-level polarity classification.</p><p>4 0.46887025 <a title="110-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Minimally_Supervised_Event_Causality_Identification.html">92 emnlp-2011-Minimally Supervised Event Causality Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Quang Do ; Yee Seng Chan ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops a minimally supervised approach, based on focused distributional similarity methods and discourse connectives, for identifying of causality relations between events in context. While it has been shown that distributional similarity can help identifying causality, we observe that discourse connectives and the particular discourse relation they evoke in context provide additional information towards determining causality between events. We show that combining discourse relation predictions and distributional similarity methods in a global inference procedure provides additional improvements towards determining event causality.</p><p>5 0.46799862 <a title="110-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Better_Evaluation_Metrics_Lead_to_Better_Machine_Translation.html">22 emnlp-2011-Better Evaluation Metrics Lead to Better Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Chang Liu ; Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Many machine translation evaluation metrics have been proposed after the seminal BLEU metric, and many among them have been found to consistently outperform BLEU, demonstrated by their better correlations with human judgment. It has long been the hope that by tuning machine translation systems against these new generation metrics, advances in automatic machine translation evaluation can lead directly to advances in automatic machine translation. However, to date there has been no unambiguous report that these new metrics can improve a state-of-theart machine translation system over its BLEUtuned baseline. In this paper, we demonstrate that tuning Joshua, a hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system, with the TESLA metrics results in significantly better humanjudged translation quality than the BLEUtuned baseline. TESLA-M in particular is simple and performs well in practice on large datasets. We release all our implementation under an open source license. It is our hope that this work will encourage the machine translation community to finally move away from BLEU as the unquestioned default and to consider the new generation metrics when tuning their systems.</p><p>6 0.46774185 <a title="110-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Hierarchical_Phrase-based_Translation_Representations.html">66 emnlp-2011-Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation Representations</a></p>

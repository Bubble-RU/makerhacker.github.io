<p>Author: Yuanbin Wu ; Qi Zhang ; Xuanjing Huang ; Lide Wu</p><p>Abstract: Based on analysis of on-line review corpus we observe that most sentences have complicated opinion structures and they cannot be well represented by existing methods, such as frame-based and feature-based ones. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based representation for sentence level sentiment. An integer linear programming-based structural learning method is then introduced to produce the graph representations of input sentences. Experimental evaluations on a manually labeled Chinese corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><p>3 0.13013582 <a title="104-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Collaborative_Ranking%3A_A_Case_Study_on_Entity_Linking.html">29 emnlp-2011-Collaborative Ranking: A Case Study on Entity Linking</a></p>
<p>Author: Zheng Chen ; Heng Ji</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new ranking scheme, collaborative ranking (CR). In contrast to traditional non-collaborative ranking scheme which solely relies on the strengths of isolated queries and one stand-alone ranking algorithm, the new scheme integrates the strengths from multiple collaborators of a query and the strengths from multiple ranking algorithms. We elaborate three specific forms of collaborative ranking, namely, micro collaborative ranking (MiCR), macro collaborative ranking (MaCR) and micro-macro collab- orative ranking (MiMaCR). Experiments on entity linking task show that our proposed scheme is indeed effective and promising.</p><p>4 0.11364888 <a title="104-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Linear_Text_Segmentation_Using_Affinity_Propagation.html">88 emnlp-2011-Linear Text Segmentation Using Affinity Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Anna Kazantseva ; Stan Szpakowicz</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for linear text segmentation. It is an adaptation of Affinity Propagation, a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm in the framework of factor graphs. Affinity Propagation for Segmentation, or APS, receives a set of pairwise similarities between data points and produces segment boundaries and segment centres data points which best describe all other data points within the segment. APS iteratively passes messages in a cyclic factor graph, until convergence. Each iteration works with information on all available similarities, resulting in highquality results. APS scales linearly for realistic segmentation tasks. We derive the algorithm from the original Affinity Propagation formu– lation, and evaluate its performance on topical text segmentation in comparison with two state-of-the art segmenters. The results suggest that APS performs on par with or outperforms these two very competitive baselines.</p><p>5 0.10113032 <a title="104-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Compositional_Matrix-Space_Models_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">30 emnlp-2011-Compositional Matrix-Space Models for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: We present a general learning-based approach for phrase-level sentiment analysis that adopts an ordinal sentiment scale and is explicitly compositional in nature. Thus, we can model the compositional effects required for accurate assignment of phrase-level sentiment. For example, combining an adverb (e.g., “very”) with a positive polar adjective (e.g., “good”) produces a phrase (“very good”) with increased polarity over the adjective alone. Inspired by recent work on distributional approaches to compositionality, we model each word as a matrix and combine words using iterated matrix multiplication, which allows for the modeling of both additive and multiplicative semantic effects. Although the multiplication-based matrix-space framework has been shown to be a theoretically elegant way to model composition (Rudolph and Giesbrecht, 2010), training such models has to be done carefully: the optimization is nonconvex and requires a good initial starting point. This paper presents the first such algorithm for learning a matrix-space model for semantic composition. In the context of the phrase-level sentiment analysis task, our experimental results show statistically significant improvements in performance over a bagof-words model.</p><p>6 0.099849463 <a title="104-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Domain-Assisted_Product_Aspect_Hierarchy_Generation%3A_Towards_Hierarchical_Organization_of_Unstructured_Consumer_Reviews.html">43 emnlp-2011-Domain-Assisted Product Aspect Hierarchy Generation: Towards Hierarchical Organization of Unstructured Consumer Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Dani Yogatama ; Michael Heilman ; Brendan O'Connor ; Chris Dyer ; Bryan R. Routledge ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting measurable responses to scientific articles based primarily on their text content. Specifically, we consider papers in two fields (economics and computational linguistics) and make predictions about downloads and within-community citations. Our approach is based on generalized linear models, allowing interpretability; a novel extension that captures first-order temporal effects is also presented. We demonstrate that text features significantly improve accuracy of predictions over metadata features like authors, topical categories, and publication venues.</p><p>3 0.53578103 <a title="104-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Structural_Opinion_Mining_for_Graph-based_Sentiment_Representation.html">126 emnlp-2011-Structural Opinion Mining for Graph-based Sentiment Representation</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhiyuan Liu ; Xinxiong Chen ; Maosong Sun</p><p>Abstract: It is popular for users in Web 2.0 era to freely annotate online resources with tags. To ease the annotation process, it has been great interest in automatic tag suggestion. We propose a method to suggest tags according to the text description of a resource. By considering both the description and tags of a given resource as summaries to the resource written in two languages, we adopt word alignment models in statistical machine translation to bridge their vocabulary gap. Based on the translation probabilities between the words in descriptions and the tags estimated on a large set of description-tags pairs, we build a word trigger method (WTM) to suggest tags according to the words in a resource description. Experiments on real world datasets show that WTM is effective and robust compared with other methods. Moreover, WTM is relatively simple and efficient, which is practical for Web applications.</p><p>5 0.39498273 <a title="104-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Collaborative_Ranking%3A_A_Case_Study_on_Entity_Linking.html">29 emnlp-2011-Collaborative Ranking: A Case Study on Entity Linking</a></p>

<p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Sam Clark ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: People tweet more than 100 Million times daily, yielding a noisy, informal, but sometimes informative corpus of 140-character messages that mirrors the zeitgeist in an unprecedented manner. The performance of standard NLP tools is severely degraded on tweets. This paper addresses this issue by re-building the NLP pipeline beginning with part-of-speech tagging, through chunking, to named-entity recognition. Our novel T-NER system doubles F1 score compared with the Stanford NER system. T-NER leverages the redundancy inherent in tweets to achieve this performance, using LabeledLDA to exploit Freebase dictionaries as a source of distant supervision. LabeledLDA outperforms cotraining, increasing F1 by 25% over ten common entity types.

<p>Author: Stephen Tratz ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsers are critical components within many NLP systems. However, currently available dependency parsers each exhibit at least one of several weaknesses, including high running time, limited accuracy, vague dependency labels, and lack of nonprojectivity support. Furthermore, no commonly used parser provides additional shallow semantic interpretation, such as preposition sense disambiguation and noun compound interpretation. In this paper, we present a new dependency-tree conversion of the Penn Treebank along with its associated fine-grain dependency labels and a fast, accurate parser trained on it. We explain how a non-projective extension to shift-reduce parsing can be incorporated into non-directional easy-first parsing. The parser performs well when evaluated on the standard test section of the Penn Treebank, outperforming several popular open source dependency parsers; it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dependency parser capable of parsing more than 75 sentences per second at over 93% accuracy.</p><p>4 0.54921311 <a title="104-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Linking_Entities_to_a_Knowledge_Base_with_Query_Expansion.html">90 emnlp-2011-Linking Entities to a Knowledge Base with Query Expansion</a></p>
<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to entity linking based on a statistical language model-based information retrieval with query expansion. We use both local contexts and global world knowledge to expand query language models. We place a strong emphasis on named entities in the local contexts and explore a positional language model to weigh them differently based on their distances to the query. Our experiments on the TAC-KBP 2010 data show that incorporating such contextual information indeed aids in disambiguating the named entities and consistently improves the entity linking performance. Compared with the official results from KBP 2010 participants, our system shows competitive performance.</p><p>5 0.52704817 <a title="104-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Domain-Assisted_Product_Aspect_Hierarchy_Generation%3A_Towards_Hierarchical_Organization_of_Unstructured_Consumer_Reviews.html">43 emnlp-2011-Domain-Assisted Product Aspect Hierarchy Generation: Towards Hierarchical Organization of Unstructured Consumer Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxing Yu ; Zheng-Jun Zha ; Meng Wang ; Kai Wang ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a domain-assisted approach to organize various aspects of a product into a hierarchy by integrating domain knowledge (e.g., the product specifications), as well as consumer reviews. Based on the derived hierarchy, we generate a hierarchical organization of consumer reviews on various product aspects and aggregate consumer opinions on these aspects. With such organization, user can easily grasp the overview of consumer reviews. Furthermore, we apply the hierarchy to the task of implicit aspect identification which aims to infer implicit aspects of the reviews that do not explicitly express those aspects but actually comment on them. The experimental results on 11popular products in four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>6 0.48437241 <a title="104-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Summarize_What_You_Are_Interested_In%3A_An_Optimization_Framework_for_Interactive_Personalized_Summarization.html">130 emnlp-2011-Summarize What You Are Interested In: An Optimization Framework for Interactive Personalized Summarization</a></p>

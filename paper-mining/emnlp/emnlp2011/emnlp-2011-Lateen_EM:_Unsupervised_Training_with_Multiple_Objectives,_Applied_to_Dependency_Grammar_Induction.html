<p>Author: Valentin I. Spitkovsky ; Hiyan Alshawi ; Angel X. Chang ; Daniel Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: We show that categories induced by unsupervised word clustering can surpass the performance of gold part-of-speech tags in dependency grammar induction. Unlike classic clustering algorithms, our method allows a word to have different tags in different contexts. In an ablative analysis, we first demonstrate that this context-dependence is crucial to the superior performance of gold tags — requiring a word to always have the same part-ofspeech significantly degrades the performance of manual tags in grammar induction, eliminating the advantage that human annotation has over unsupervised tags. We then introduce a sequence modeling technique that combines the output of a word clustering algorithm with context-colored noise, to allow words to be tagged differently in different contexts. With these new induced tags as input, our state-of- the-art dependency grammar inducer achieves 59. 1% directed accuracy on Section 23 (all sentences) of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus — 0.7% higher than using gold tags.</p><p>3 0.082082026 <a title="79-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Structure_Prediction_with_Non-Parallel_Multilingual_Guidance.html">146 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Structure Prediction with Non-Parallel Multilingual Guidance</a></p>
<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen ; Dipanjan Das ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method for prediction of linguistic structure in a language for which only unlabeled data is available, using annotated data from a set of one or more helper languages. Our approach is based on a model that locally mixes between supervised models from the helper languages. Parallel data is not used, allowing the technique to be applied even in domains where human-translated texts are unavailable. We obtain state-of-theart performance for two tasks of structure prediction: unsupervised part-of-speech tagging and unsupervised dependency parsing.</p><p>4 0.05133475 <a title="79-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Closing_the_Loop%3A_Fast%2C_Interactive_Semi-Supervised_Annotation_With_Queries_on_Features_and_Instances.html">28 emnlp-2011-Closing the Loop: Fast, Interactive Semi-Supervised Annotation With Queries on Features and Instances</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryan McDonald ; Slav Petrov ; Keith Hall</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple method for transferring dependency parsers from source languages with labeled training data to target languages without labeled training data. We first demonstrate that delexicalized parsers can be directly transferred between languages, producing significantly higher accuracies than unsupervised parsers. We then use a constraint driven learning algorithm where constraints are drawn from parallel corpora to project the final parser. Unlike previous work on projecting syntactic resources, we show that simple methods for introducing multiple source lan- guages can significantly improve the overall quality of the resulting parsers. The projected parsers from our system result in state-of-theart performance when compared to previously studied unsupervised and projected parsing systems across eight different languages.</p><p>6 0.046797119 <a title="79-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Evaluating_Dependency_Parsing%3A_Robust_and_Heuristics-Free_Cross-Annotation_Evaluation.html">50 emnlp-2011-Evaluating Dependency Parsing: Robust and Heuristics-Free Cross-Annotation Evaluation</a></p>

<p>Author: Dani Yogatama ; Michael Heilman ; Brendan O'Connor ; Chris Dyer ; Bryan R. Routledge ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting measurable responses to scientific articles based primarily on their text content. Specifically, we consider papers in two fields (economics and computational linguistics) and make predictions about downloads and within-community citations. Our approach is based on generalized linear models, allowing interpretability; a novel extension that captures first-order temporal effects is also presented. We demonstrate that text features significantly improve accuracy of predictions over metadata features like authors, topical categories, and publication venues.</p><p>5 0.32307416 <a title="79-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Corpus-Guided_Sentence_Generation_of_Natural_Images.html">34 emnlp-2011-Corpus-Guided Sentence Generation of Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Yezhou Yang ; Ching Teo ; Hal Daume III ; Yiannis Aloimonos</p><p>Abstract: We propose a sentence generation strategy that describes images by predicting the most likely nouns, verbs, scenes and prepositions that make up the core sentence structure. The input are initial noisy estimates of the objects and scenes detected in the image using state of the art trained detectors. As predicting actions from still images directly is unreliable, we use a language model trained from the English Gigaword corpus to obtain their estimates; together with probabilities of co-located nouns, scenes and prepositions. We use these estimates as parameters on a HMM that models the sentence generation process, with hidden nodes as sentence components and image detections as the emissions. Experimental results show that our strategy of combining vision and language produces readable and de- , scriptive sentences compared to naive strategies that use vision alone.</p><p>6 0.31905615 <a title="79-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Information_Extraction_with_Distributional_Prior_Knowledge.html">143 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Information Extraction with Distributional Prior Knowledge</a></p>

Word aligners that model the alignment matrix can express arbitrary alignments, but are difficult to decode. We propose an alignment matrix model as a correction algorithm to an underlying sequencebased aligner. Then a greedy decoding algorithm enables the full expressive power of the alignment matrix formulation. Improved alignment performance is shown for all nine language pairs tested. The improved alignments also improved translation quality from Chinese to English and English to Italian.</p><p>4 0.84627527 <a title="79-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_a_Parser_for_Machine_Translation_Reordering.html">136 emnlp-2011-Training a Parser for Machine Translation Reordering</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Katz-Brown ; Slav Petrov ; Ryan McDonald ; Franz Och ; David Talbot ; Hiroshi Ichikawa ; Masakazu Seno ; Hideto Kazawa</p><p>Abstract: We propose a simple training regime that can improve the extrinsic performance of a parser, given only a corpus of sentences and a way to automatically evaluate the extrinsic quality of a candidate parse. We apply our method to train parsers that excel when used as part of a reordering component in a statistical machine translation system. We use a corpus of weakly-labeled reference reorderings to guide parser training. Our best parsers contribute significant improvements in subjective translation quality while their intrinsic attachment scores typically regress.</p><p>5 0.84597266 <a title="79-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Structural_Opinion_Mining_for_Graph-based_Sentiment_Representation.html">126 emnlp-2011-Structural Opinion Mining for Graph-based Sentiment Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuanbin Wu ; Qi Zhang ; Xuanjing Huang ; Lide Wu</p><p>Abstract: Based on analysis of on-line review corpus we observe that most sentences have complicated opinion structures and they cannot be well represented by existing methods, such as frame-based and feature-based ones. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based representation for sentence level sentiment. An integer linear programming-based structural learning method is then introduced to produce the graph representations of input sentences. Experimental evaluations on a manually labeled Chinese corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><p>6 0.84596175 <a title="79-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Generating_Subsequent_Reference_in_Shared_Visual_Scenes%3A_Computation_vs_Re-Use.html">62 emnlp-2011-Generating Subsequent Reference in Shared Visual Scenes: Computation vs Re-Use</a></p>

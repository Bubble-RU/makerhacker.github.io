<p>Author: Joel Lang ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a method for unsupervised semantic role induction which we formalize as a graph partitioning problem. Argument instances of a verb are represented as vertices in a graph whose edge weights quantify their role-semantic similarity. Graph partitioning is realized with an algorithm that iteratively assigns vertices to clusters based on the cluster assignments of neighboring vertices. Our method is algorithmically and conceptually simple, especially with respect to how problem-specific knowledge is incorporated into the model. Experimental results on the CoNLL 2008 benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model is competitive with other unsupervised approaches in terms of F1 whilst attaining significantly higher cluster purity.</p><p>3 0.099593937 <a title="26-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Relation_Acquisition_using_Word_Classes_and_Partial_Patterns.html">113 emnlp-2011-Relation Acquisition using Word Classes and Partial Patterns</a></p>
<p>Author: Stijn De Saeger ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Masaaki Tsuchida ; Jun'ichi Kazama ; Chikara Hashimoto ; Ichiro Yamada ; Jong Hoon Oh ; Istvan Varga ; Yulan Yan</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a semi-supervised relation acquisition method that does not rely on extraction patterns (e.g. “X causes Y” for causal relations) but instead learns a combination of indirect evidence for the target relation semantic word classes and partial patterns. This method can extract long tail instances of semantic relations like causality from rare and complex expressions in a large Japanese Web corpus in extreme cases, patterns that occur only once in the entire corpus. Such patterns are beyond the reach ofcurrent pattern based methods. We show that our method performs on par with state-of-the-art pattern based methods, and maintains a reasonable level of accuracy even for instances — — acquired from infrequent patterns. This ability to acquire long tail instances is crucial for risk management and innovation, where an exhaustive database of high-level semantic relations like causation is of vital importance.</p><p>4 0.086198226 <a title="26-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Extreme_Extraction_-_Machine_Reading_in_a_Week.html">57 emnlp-2011-Extreme Extraction - Machine Reading in a Week</a></p>
<p>Author: Marjorie Freedman ; Lance Ramshaw ; Elizabeth Boschee ; Ryan Gabbard ; Gary Kratkiewicz ; Nicolas Ward ; Ralph Weischedel</p><p>Abstract: We report on empirical results in extreme extraction. It is extreme in that (1) from receipt of the ontology specifying the target concepts and relations, development is limited to one week and that (2) relatively little training data is assumed. We are able to surpass human recall and achieve an F1 of 0.5 1 on a question-answering task with less than 50 hours of effort using a hybrid approach that mixes active learning, bootstrapping, and limited (5 hours) manual rule writing. We compare the performance of three systems: extraction with handwritten rules, bootstrapped extraction, and a combination. We show that while the recall of the handwritten rules surpasses that of the learned system, the learned system is able to improve the overall recall and F1.</p><p>5 0.080119371 <a title="26-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Structured_Relation_Discovery_using_Generative_Models.html">128 emnlp-2011-Structured Relation Discovery using Generative Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Aria Haghighi ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We explore unsupervised approaches to relation extraction between two named entities; for instance, the semantic bornIn relation between a person and location entity. Concretely, we propose a series of generative probabilistic models, broadly similar to topic models, each which generates a corpus of observed triples of entity mention pairs and the surface syntactic dependency path between them. The output of each model is a clustering of observed relation tuples and their associated textual expressions to underlying semantic relation types. Our proposed models exploit entity type constraints within a relation as well as features on the dependency path between entity mentions. We examine effectiveness of our approach via multiple evaluations and demonstrate 12% error reduction in precision over a state-of-the-art weakly supervised baseline.</p><p>6 0.071189247 <a title="26-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Random_Walk_Inference_and_Learning_in_A_Large_Scale_Knowledge_Base.html">109 emnlp-2011-Random Walk Inference and Learning in A Large Scale Knowledge Base</a></p>

<p>Author: Ziqi Zhang ; Anna Lisa Gentile ; Fabio Ciravegna</p><p>Abstract: Measuring semantic relatedness between words or concepts is a crucial process to many Natural Language Processing tasks. Exiting methods exploit semantic evidence from a single knowledge source, and are predominantly evaluated only in the general domain. This paper introduces a method of harnessing different knowledge sources under a uniform model for measuring semantic relatedness between words or concepts. Using Wikipedia and WordNet as examples, and evaluated in both the general and biomedical domains, it successfully combines strengths from both knowledge sources and outperforms stateof-the-art on many datasets.</p><p>5 0.43101925 <a title="26-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Large-Scale_Noun_Compound_Interpretation_Using_Bootstrapping_and_the_Web_as_a_Corpus.html">78 emnlp-2011-Large-Scale Noun Compound Interpretation Using Bootstrapping and the Web as a Corpus</a></p>
<p>Author: Su Nam Kim ; Preslav Nakov</p><p>Abstract: Responding to the need for semantic lexical resources in natural language processing applications, we examine methods to acquire noun compounds (NCs), e.g., orange juice, together with suitable fine-grained semantic interpretations, e.g., squeezed from, which are directly usable as paraphrases. We employ bootstrapping and web statistics, and utilize the relationship between NCs and paraphrasing patterns to jointly extract NCs and such patterns in multiple alternating iterations. In evaluation, we found that having one compound noun fixed yields both a higher number of semantically interpreted NCs and improved accuracy due to stronger semantic restrictions.</p><p>6 0.39369327 <a title="26-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Semantic_Role_Induction_with_Graph_Partitioning.html">145 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Semantic Role Induction with Graph Partitioning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Feifei Zhai ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Due to its explicit modeling of the grammaticality of the output via target-side syntax, the string-to-tree model has been shown to be one of the most successful syntax-based translation models. However, a major limitation of this model is that it does not utilize any useful syntactic information on the source side. In this paper, we analyze the difficulties of incorporating source syntax in a string-totree model. We then propose a new way to use the source syntax in a fuzzy manner, both in source syntactic annotation and in rule matching. We further explore three algorithms in rule matching: 0-1 matching, likelihood matching, and deep similarity matching. Our method not only guarantees grammatical output with an explicit target tree, but also enables the system to choose the proper translation rules via fuzzy use of the source syntax. Our extensive experiments have shown significant improvements over the state-of-the-art string-to-tree system. 1</p><p>3 0.65511626 <a title="26-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Reducing_Grounded_Learning_Tasks_To_Grammatical_Inference.html">111 emnlp-2011-Reducing Grounded Learning Tasks To Grammatical Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Borschinger ; Bevan K. Jones ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: It is often assumed that ‘grounded’ learning tasks are beyond the scope of grammatical inference techniques. In this paper, we show that the grounded task of learning a semantic parser from ambiguous training data as discussed in Kim and Mooney (2010) can be reduced to a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar learning task in a way that gives state of the art results. We further show that additionally letting our model learn the language’s canonical word order improves its performance and leads to the highest semantic parsing f-scores previously reported in the literature.1</p><p>4 0.52536494 <a title="26-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Feature-Rich_Language-Independent_Syntax-Based_Alignment_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">60 emnlp-2011-Feature-Rich Language-Independent Syntax-Based Alignment for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

Exiting methods exploit semantic evidence from a single knowledge source, and are predominantly evaluated only in the general domain. This paper introduces a method of harnessing different knowledge sources under a uniform model for measuring semantic relatedness between words or concepts. Using Wikipedia and WordNet as examples, and evaluated in both the general and biomedical domains, it successfully combines strengths from both knowledge sources and outperforms stateof-the-art on many datasets.</p><p>6 0.44585082 <a title="26-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_novel_dependency-to-string_model_for_statistical_machine_translation.html">15 emnlp-2011-A novel dependency-to-string model for statistical machine translation</a></p>

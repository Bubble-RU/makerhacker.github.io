<p>Author: David Mimno ; David Blei</p><p>Abstract: Real document collections do not fit the independence assumptions asserted by most statistical topic models, but how badly do they violate them? We present a Bayesian method for measuring how well a topic model fits a corpus. Our approach is based on posterior predictive checking, a method for diagnosing Bayesian models in user-defined ways. Our method can identify where a topic model fits the data, where it falls short, and in which directions it might be improved.</p><p>3 0.16932467 <a title="101-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Semantic_Topic_Models%3A_Combining_Word_Distributional_Statistics_and_Dictionary_Definitions.html">119 emnlp-2011-Semantic Topic Models: Combining Word Distributional Statistics and Dictionary Definitions</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel topic model based on incorporating dictionary definitions. Traditional topic models treat words as surface strings without assuming predefined knowledge about word meaning. They infer topics only by observing surface word co-occurrence. However, the co-occurred words may not be semantically related in a manner that is relevant for topic coherence. Exploiting dictionary definitions explicitly in our model yields a better understanding of word semantics leading to better text modeling. We exploit WordNet as a lexical resource for sense definitions. We show that explicitly modeling word definitions helps improve performance significantly over the baseline for a text categorization task.</p><p>4 0.16514643 <a title="101-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Cross-Cutting_Models_of_Lexical_Semantics.html">37 emnlp-2011-Cross-Cutting Models of Lexical Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Reisinger ; Raymond Mooney</p><p>Abstract: Context-dependent word similarity can be measured over multiple cross-cutting dimensions. For example, lung and breath are similar thematically, while authoritative and superficial occur in similar syntactic contexts, but share little semantic similarity. Both of these notions of similarity play a role in determining word meaning, and hence lexical semantic models must take them both into account. Towards this end, we develop a novel model, Multi-View Mixture (MVM), that represents words as multiple overlapping clusterings. MVM finds multiple data partitions based on different subsets of features, subject to the marginal constraint that feature subsets are distributed according to Latent Dirich- let Allocation. Intuitively, this constraint favors feature partitions that have coherent topical semantics. Furthermore, MVM uses soft feature assignment, hence the contribution of each data point to each clustering view is variable, isolating the impact of data only to views where they assign the most features. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the utility of MVM as an inductive bias for capturing relations between words that are intuitive to humans, outperforming related models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation.</p><p>5 0.11226191 <a title="101-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Exploring_Supervised_LDA_Models_for_Assigning_Attributes_to_Adjective-Noun_Phrases.html">56 emnlp-2011-Exploring Supervised LDA Models for Assigning Attributes to Adjective-Noun Phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Hartung ; Anette Frank</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an attribute selection task as a way to characterize the inherent meaning of property-denoting adjectives in adjective-noun phrases, such as e.g. hot in hot summer denoting the attribute TEMPERATURE, rather than TASTE. We formulate this task in a vector space model that represents adjectives and nouns as vectors in a semantic space defined over possible attributes. The vectors incorporate latent semantic information obtained from two variants of LDA topic models. Our LDA models outperform previous approaches on a small set of 10 attributes with considerable gains on sparse representations, which highlights the strong smoothing power of LDA models. For the first time, we extend the attribute selection task to a new data set with more than 200 classes. We observe that large-scale attribute selection is a hard problem, but a subset of attributes performs robustly on the large scale as well. Again, the LDA models outperform the VSM baseline.</p><p>6 0.093214117 <a title="101-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Robust_Disambiguation_of_Named_Entities_in_Text.html">116 emnlp-2011-Robust Disambiguation of Named Entities in Text</a></p>

<p>Author: Keith Vertanen ; Per Ola Kristensson</p><p>Abstract: Augmented and alternative communication (AAC) devices enable users with certain communication disabilities to participate in everyday conversations. Such devices often rely on statistical language models to improve text entry by offering word predictions. These predictions can be improved if the language model is trained on data that closely reflects the style of the users’ intended communications. Unfortunately, there is no large dataset consisting of genuine AAC messages. In this paper we demonstrate how we can crowdsource the creation of a large set of fictional AAC messages. We show that these messages model conversational AAC better than the currently used datasets based on telephone conversations or newswire text. We leverage our crowdsourced messages to intelligently select sentences from much larger sets of Twitter, blog and Usenet data. Compared to a model trained only on telephone transcripts, our best performing model reduced perplexity on three test sets of AAC-like communications by 60– 82% relative. This translated to a potential keystroke savings in a predictive keyboard interface of 5–1 1%.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.75574088 <a title="101-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Optimizing_Semantic_Coherence_in_Topic_Models.html">101 emnlp-2011-Optimizing Semantic Coherence in Topic Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Samuel Brody ; Nicholas Diakopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method which leverages word lengthening to adapt a sentiment lexicon specifically for Twitter and similar social messaging networks. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we call attention to lengthening as a widespread phenomenon in microblogs and social messaging, and demonstrate the importance of handling it correctly. We then show that lengthening is strongly associated with subjectivity and sentiment. Finally, we present an automatic method which leverages this association to detect domain-specific sentiment- and emotionbearing words. We evaluate our method by comparison to human judgments, and analyze its strengths and weaknesses. Our results are of interest to anyone analyzing sentiment in microblogs and social networks, whether for research or commercial purposes.</p><p>4 0.67391378 <a title="101-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Correction_Model_for_Word_Alignments.html">3 emnlp-2011-A Correction Model for Word Alignments</a></p>
<p>Author: J. Scott McCarley ; Abraham Ittycheriah ; Salim Roukos ; Bing Xiang ; Jian-ming Xu</p><p>Abstract: Models of word alignment built as sequences of links have limited expressive power, but are easy to decode. Word aligners that model the alignment matrix can express arbitrary alignments, but are difficult to decode. We propose an alignment matrix model as a correction algorithm to an underlying sequencebased aligner. Then a greedy decoding algorithm enables the full expressive power of the alignment matrix formulation. Improved alignment performance is shown for all nine language pairs tested. The improved alignments also improved translation quality from Chinese to English and English to Italian.</p><p>5 0.6730895 <a title="101-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Bootstrapped_Named_Entity_Recognition_for_Product_Attribute_Extraction.html">23 emnlp-2011-Bootstrapped Named Entity Recognition for Product Attribute Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Duangmanee Putthividhya ; Junling Hu</p><p>Abstract: We present a named entity recognition (NER) system for extracting product attributes and values from listing titles. Information extraction from short listing titles present a unique challenge, with the lack of informative context and grammatical structure. In this work, we combine supervised NER with bootstrapping to expand the seed list, and output normalized results. Focusing on listings from eBay’s clothing and shoes categories, our bootstrapped NER system is able to identify new brands corresponding to spelling variants and typographical errors of the known brands, as well as identifying novel brands. Among the top 300 new brands predicted, our system achieves 90.33% precision. To output normalized attribute values, we explore several string comparison algorithms and found n-gram substring matching to work well in practice.</p><p>6 0.6726374 <a title="101-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Harnessing_WordNet_Senses_for_Supervised_Sentiment_Classification.html">63 emnlp-2011-Harnessing WordNet Senses for Supervised Sentiment Classification</a></p>

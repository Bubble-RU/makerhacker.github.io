<p>Author: Yugo Murawaki ; Sadao Kurohashi</p><p>Abstract: A key factor of high quality word segmentation for Japanese is a high-coverage dictionary, but it is costly to manually build such a lexical resource. Although external lexical resources for human readers are potentially good knowledge sources, they have not been utilized due to differences in segmentation criteria. To supplement a morphological dictionary with these resources, we propose a new task of Japanese noun phrase segmentation. We apply non-parametric Bayesian language models to segment each noun phrase in these resources according to the statistical behavior of its supposed constituents in text. For inference, we propose a novel block sampling procedure named hybrid type-based sampling, which has the ability to directly escape a local optimum that is not too distant from the global optimum. Experiments show that the proposed method efficiently corrects the initial segmentation given by a morphological ana- lyzer.</p><p>3 0.1806418 <a title="88-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Enhancing_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_Using_Unlabeled_Data.html">48 emnlp-2011-Enhancing Chinese Word Segmentation Using Unlabeled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Sun ; Jia Xu</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates improving supervised word segmentation accuracy with unlabeled data. Both large-scale in-domain data and small-scale document text are considered. We present a unified solution to include features derived from unlabeled data to a discriminative learning model. For the large-scale data, we derive string statistics from Gigaword to assist a character-based segmenter. In addition, we introduce the idea about transductive, document-level segmentation, which is designed to improve the system recall for out-ofvocabulary (OOV) words which appear more than once inside a document. Novel features1 result in relative error reductions of 13.8% and 15.4% in terms of F-score and the recall of OOV words respectively.</p><p>4 0.11364888 <a title="88-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Personalized_Recommendation_of_User_Comments_via_Factor_Models.html">104 emnlp-2011-Personalized Recommendation of User Comments via Factor Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Deepak Agarwal ; Bee-Chung Chen ; Bo Pang</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, the amount of user-generated opinionated texts (e.g., reviews, user comments) continues to grow at a rapid speed: featured news stories on a major event easily attract thousands of user comments on a popular online News service. How to consume subjective information ofthis volume becomes an interesting and important research question. In contrast to previous work on review analysis that tried to filter or summarize information for a generic average user, we explore a different direction of enabling personalized recommendation of such information. For each user, our task is to rank the comments associated with a given article according to personalized user preference (i.e., whether the user is likely to like or dislike the comment). To this end, we propose a factor model that incorporates rater-comment and rater-author interactions simultaneously in a principled way. Our full model significantly outperforms strong baselines as well as related models that have been considered in previous work.</p><p>5 0.09685868 <a title="88-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Classifying_Sentences_as_Speech_Acts_in_Message_Board_Posts.html">27 emnlp-2011-Classifying Sentences as Speech Acts in Message Board Posts</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashequl Qadir ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: This research studies the text genre of message board forums, which contain a mixture of expository sentences that present factual information and conversational sentences that include communicative acts between the writer and readers. Our goal is to create sentence classifiers that can identify whether a sentence contains a speech act, and can recognize sentences containing four different speech act classes: Commissives, Directives, Expressives, and Representatives. We conduct experiments using a wide variety of features, including lexical and syntactic features, speech act word lists from external resources, and domain-specific semantic class features. We evaluate our results on a collection of message board posts in the domain of veterinary medicine.</p><p>6 0.088678449 <a title="88-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Correction_Model_for_Word_Alignments.html">3 emnlp-2011-A Correction Model for Word Alignments</a></p>

<p>Author: Nobuhiro Kaji ; Masaru Kitsuregawa</p><p>Abstract: Word boundaries within noun compounds are not marked by white spaces in a number of languages, unlike in English, and it is beneficial for various NLP applications to split such noun compounds. In the case of Japanese, noun compounds made up of katakana words (i.e., transliterated foreign words) are particularly difficult to split, because katakana words are highly productive and are often outof-vocabulary. To overcome this difficulty, we propose using monolingual and bilingual paraphrases of katakana noun compounds for identifying word boundaries. Experiments demonstrated that splitting accuracy is substantially improved by extracting such paraphrases from unlabeled textual data, the Web in our case, and then using that information for constructing splitting models.</p><p>6 0.25976127 <a title="88-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Classifying_Sentences_as_Speech_Acts_in_Message_Board_Posts.html">27 emnlp-2011-Classifying Sentences as Speech Acts in Message Board Posts</a></p>

<p>Author: Amit Dubey ; Frank Keller ; Patrick Sturt</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a psycholinguistic model of sentence processing which combines a Hidden Markov Model noun phrase chunker with a co-reference classifier. Both models are fully incremental and generative, giving probabilities of lexical elements conditional upon linguistic structure. This allows us to compute the information theoretic measure of surprisal, which is known to correlate with human processing effort. We evaluate our surprisal predictions on the Dundee corpus of eye-movement data show that our model achieve a better fit with human reading times than a syntax-only model which does not have access to co-reference information.</p><p>3 0.62618613 <a title="88-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Identification_of_Multi-word_Expressions_by_Combining_Multiple_Linguistic_Information_Sources.html">69 emnlp-2011-Identification of Multi-word Expressions by Combining Multiple Linguistic Information Sources</a></p>
<p>Author: Yulia Tsvetkov ; Shuly Wintner</p><p>Abstract: We propose an architecture for expressing various linguistically-motivated features that help identify multi-word expressions in natural language texts. The architecture combines various linguistically-motivated classification features in a Bayesian Network. We introduce novel ways for computing many of these features, and manually define linguistically-motivated interrelationships among them, which the Bayesian network models. Our methodology is almost entirely unsupervised and completely languageindependent; it relies on few language resources and is thus suitable for a large number of languages. Furthermore, unlike much recent work, our approach can identify expressions of various types and syntactic con- structions. We demonstrate a significant improvement in identification accuracy, compared with less sophisticated baselines.</p><p>4 0.57882017 <a title="88-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Predicting_Sentiment_Distributions.html">120 emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoders for Predicting Sentiment Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Jeffrey Pennington ; Eric H. Huang ; Andrew Y. Ng ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning framework based on recursive autoencoders for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label distributions. Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the model’s ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures emotional reactions. Our algorithm can more accurately predict distributions over such labels compared to several competitive baselines.</p><p>5 0.43767893 <a title="88-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Non-parametric_Bayesian_Segmentation_of_Japanese_Noun_Phrases.html">99 emnlp-2011-Non-parametric Bayesian Segmentation of Japanese Noun Phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Yugo Murawaki ; Sadao Kurohashi</p><p>Abstract: A key factor of high quality word segmentation for Japanese is a high-coverage dictionary, but it is costly to manually build such a lexical resource. Although external lexical resources for human readers are potentially good knowledge sources, they have not been utilized due to differences in segmentation criteria. To supplement a morphological dictionary with these resources, we propose a new task of Japanese noun phrase segmentation. We apply non-parametric Bayesian language models to segment each noun phrase in these resources according to the statistical behavior of its supposed constituents in text. For inference, we propose a novel block sampling procedure named hybrid type-based sampling, which has the ability to directly escape a local optimum that is not too distant from the global optimum. Experiments show that the proposed method efficiently corrects the initial segmentation given by a morphological ana- lyzer.</p><p>6 0.43411627 <a title="88-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Generating_Subsequent_Reference_in_Shared_Visual_Scenes%3A_Computation_vs_Re-Use.html">62 emnlp-2011-Generating Subsequent Reference in Shared Visual Scenes: Computation vs Re-Use</a></p>

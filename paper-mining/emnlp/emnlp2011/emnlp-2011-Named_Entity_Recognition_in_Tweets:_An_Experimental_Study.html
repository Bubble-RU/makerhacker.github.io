This paper describes the construction of a large, multilingual dataset labeled with gender, and investigates statistical models for determining the gender of uncharacterized Twitter users. We explore several different classifier types on this dataset. We show the degree to which classifier accuracy varies based on tweet volumes as well as when various kinds of profile metadata are included in the models. We also perform a large-scale human assessment using Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Yet, so far not much attention has been paid on a key characteristic of microblogs: the high level of information redundancy. The aim of this paper is to systematically approach this problem by providing an operational definition of redundancy. We cast redundancy in the framework of Textual Entailment Recognition. We also provide quantitative evidence on the pervasiveness of redundancy in Twitter, and describe a dataset of redundancy-annotated tweets.

<p>Author: Roy Bar-Haim ; Elad Dinur ; Ronen Feldman ; Moshe Fresko ; Guy Goldstein</p><p>Abstract: Information published in online stock investment message boards, and more recently in stock microblogs, is considered highly valuable by many investors. Previous work focused on aggregation of sentiment from all users. However, in this work we show that it is beneficial to distinguish expert users from non-experts. We propose a general framework for identifying expert investors, and use it as a basis for several models that predict stock rise from stock microblogging messages (stock tweets). In particular, we present two methods that combine expert identification and per-user unsupervised learning. These methods were shown to achieve relatively high precision in predicting stock rise, and significantly outperform our baseline. In addition, our work provides an in-depth analysis of the content and potential usefulness of stock tweets.</p><p>5 0.26650745 <a title="98-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Structured_Relation_Discovery_using_Generative_Models.html">128 emnlp-2011-Structured Relation Discovery using Generative Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Aria Haghighi ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We explore unsupervised approaches to relation extraction between two named entities; for instance, the semantic bornIn relation between a person and location entity. Concretely, we propose a series of generative probabilistic models, broadly similar to topic models, each which generates a corpus of observed triples of entity mention pairs and the surface syntactic dependency path between them. The output of each model is a clustering of observed relation tuples and their associated textual expressions to underlying semantic relation types. Our proposed models exploit entity type constraints within a relation as well as features on the dependency path between entity mentions. We examine effectiveness of our approach via multiple evaluations and demonstrate 12% error reduction in precision over a state-of-the-art weakly supervised baseline.</p><p>6 0.25381103 <a title="98-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Rumor_has_it%3A_Identifying_Misinformation_in_Microblogs.html">117 emnlp-2011-Rumor has it: Identifying Misinformation in Microblogs</a></p>

<p>Author: Vahed Qazvinian ; Emily Rosengren ; Dragomir R. Radev ; Qiaozhu Mei</p><p>Abstract: A rumor is commonly defined as a statement whose true value is unverifiable. Rumors may spread misinformation (false information) or disinformation (deliberately false information) on a network of people. Identifying rumors is crucial in online social media where large amounts of information are easily spread across a large network by sources with unverified authority. In this paper, we address the problem of rumor detection in microblogs and explore the effectiveness of 3 categories of features: content-based, network-based, and microblog-specific memes for correctly identifying rumors. Moreover, we show how these features are also effective in identifying disinformers, users who endorse a rumor and further help it to spread. We perform our experiments on more than 10,000 manually annotated tweets collected from Twitter and show how our retrieval model achieves more than 0.95 in Mean Average Precision (MAP). Fi- nally, we believe that our dataset is the first large-scale dataset on rumor detection. It can open new dimensions in analyzing online misinformation and other aspects of microblog conversations.</p><p>6 0.69368625 <a title="98-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Twitter_Catches_The_Flu%3A_Detecting_Influenza_Epidemics_using_Twitter.html">139 emnlp-2011-Twitter Catches The Flu: Detecting Influenza Epidemics using Twitter</a></p>

<p>Author: Deepak Agarwal ; Bee-Chung Chen ; Bo Pang</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, the amount of user-generated opinionated texts (e.g., reviews, user comments) continues to grow at a rapid speed: featured news stories on a major event easily attract thousands of user comments on a popular online News service. How to consume subjective information ofthis volume becomes an interesting and important research question. In contrast to previous work on review analysis that tried to filter or summarize information for a generic average user, we explore a different direction of enabling personalized recommendation of such information. For each user, our task is to rank the comments associated with a given article according to personalized user preference (i.e., whether the user is likely to like or dislike the comment). To this end, we propose a factor model that incorporates rater-comment and rater-author interactions simultaneously in a principled way. Our full model significantly outperforms strong baselines as well as related models that have been considered in previous work.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.79845244 <a title="98-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Tweets%3A_An_Experimental_Study.html">98 emnlp-2011-Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephen Tratz ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsers are critical components within many NLP systems. However, currently available dependency parsers each exhibit at least one of several weaknesses, including high running time, limited accuracy, vague dependency labels, and lack of nonprojectivity support. Furthermore, no commonly used parser provides additional shallow semantic interpretation, such as preposition sense disambiguation and noun compound interpretation. In this paper, we present a new dependency-tree conversion of the Penn Treebank along with its associated fine-grain dependency labels and a fast, accurate parser trained on it. We explain how a non-projective extension to shift-reduce parsing can be incorporated into non-directional easy-first parsing. The parser performs well when evaluated on the standard test section of the Penn Treebank, outperforming several popular open source dependency parsers; it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dependency parser capable of parsing more than 75 sentences per second at over 93% accuracy.</p><p>4 0.66605932 <a title="98-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Linking_Entities_to_a_Knowledge_Base_with_Query_Expansion.html">90 emnlp-2011-Linking Entities to a Knowledge Base with Query Expansion</a></p>
<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to entity linking based on a statistical language model-based information retrieval with query expansion. We use both local contexts and global world knowledge to expand query language models. We place a strong emphasis on named entities in the local contexts and explore a positional language model to weigh them differently based on their distances to the query. Our experiments on the TAC-KBP 2010 data show that incorporating such contextual information indeed aids in disambiguating the named entities and consistently improves the entity linking performance. Compared with the official results from KBP 2010 participants, our system shows competitive performance.</p><p>5 0.62709224 <a title="98-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Domain-Assisted_Product_Aspect_Hierarchy_Generation%3A_Towards_Hierarchical_Organization_of_Unstructured_Consumer_Reviews.html">43 emnlp-2011-Domain-Assisted Product Aspect Hierarchy Generation: Towards Hierarchical Organization of Unstructured Consumer Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxing Yu ; Zheng-Jun Zha ; Meng Wang ; Kai Wang ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a domain-assisted approach to organize various aspects of a product into a hierarchy by integrating domain knowledge (e.g., the product specifications), as well as consumer reviews. Based on the derived hierarchy, we generate a hierarchical organization of consumer reviews on various product aspects and aggregate consumer opinions on these aspects. With such organization, user can easily grasp the overview of consumer reviews. Furthermore, we apply the hierarchy to the task of implicit aspect identification which aims to infer implicit aspects of the reviews that do not explicitly express those aspects but actually comment on them. The experimental results on 11popular products in four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>6 0.60111761 <a title="98-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Correction_Model_for_Word_Alignments.html">3 emnlp-2011-A Correction Model for Word Alignments</a></p>

<p>Author: Yue Zhang ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: Machine-produced text often lacks grammaticality and fluency. This paper studies grammaticality improvement using a syntax-based algorithm based on CCG. The goal of the search problem is to find an optimal parse tree among all that can be constructed through selection and ordering of the input words. The search problem, which is significantly harder than parsing, is solved by guided learning for best-first search. In a standard word ordering task, our system gives a BLEU score of 40. 1, higher than the previous result of 33.7 achieved by a dependency-based system.</p><p>3 0.18711214 <a title="121-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Lexical_Generalization_in_CCG_Grammar_Induction_for_Semantic_Parsing.html">87 emnlp-2011-Lexical Generalization in CCG Grammar Induction for Semantic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning factored probabilistic CCG grammars for semantic parsing from data containing sentences paired with logical-form meaning representations. Traditional CCG lexicons list lexical items that pair words and phrases with syntactic and semantic content. Such lexicons can be inefficient when words appear repeatedly with closely related lexical content. In this paper, we introduce factored lexicons, which include both lexemes to model word meaning and templates to model systematic variation in word usage. We also present an algorithm for learning factored CCG lexicons, along with a probabilistic parse-selection model.

<p>Author: Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Conversations provide rich opportunities for interactive, continuous learning. When something goes wrong, a system can ask for clarification, rewording, or otherwise redirect the interaction to achieve its goals. In this paper, we present an approach for using conversational interactions of this type to induce semantic parsers. We demonstrate learning without any explicit annotation of the meanings of user utterances. Instead, we model meaning with latent variables, and introduce a loss function to measure how well potential meanings match the conversation. This loss drives the overall learning approach, which induces a weighted CCG grammar that could be used to automatically bootstrap the semantic analysis component in a complete dialog system.

<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Feifei Zhai ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Due to its explicit modeling of the grammaticality of the output via target-side syntax, the string-to-tree model has been shown to be one of the most successful syntax-based translation models. However, a major limitation of this model is that it does not utilize any useful syntactic information on the source side. In this paper, we analyze the difficulties of incorporating source syntax in a string-totree model. We then propose a new way to use the source syntax in a fuzzy manner, both in source syntactic annotation and in rule matching. We further explore three algorithms in rule matching: 0-1 matching, likelihood matching, and deep similarity matching. Our method not only guarantees grammatical output with an explicit target tree, but also enables the system to choose the proper translation rules via fuzzy use of the source syntax. Our extensive experiments have shown significant improvements over the state-of-the-art string-to-tree system. 1</p><p>6 0.088864431 <a title="121-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Parser_Evaluation_over_Local_and_Non-Local_Deep_Dependencies_in_a_Large_Corpus.html">103 emnlp-2011-Parser Evaluation over Local and Non-Local Deep Dependencies in a Large Corpus</a></p>

<p>Author: Christof Monz</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech language modeling is commonly used as a component in statistical machine translation systems, but there is mixed evidence that its usage leads to significant improvements. We argue that its limited effectiveness is due to the lack of lexicalization. We introduce a new approach that builds a separate local language model for each word and part-of-speech pair. The resulting models lead to more context-sensitive probability distributions and we also exploit the fact that different local models are used to estimate the language model probability of each word during decoding. Our approach is evaluated for Arabic- and Chinese-to-English translation. We show that it leads to statistically significant improvements for multiple test sets and also across different genres, when compared against a competitive baseline and a system using a part-of-speech model.</p><p>3 0.81137687 <a title="121-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Modelling_Discourse_Relations_for_Arabic.html">94 emnlp-2011-Modelling Discourse Relations for Arabic</a></p>
<p>Author: Amal Al-Saif ; Katja Markert</p><p>Abstract: We present the first algorithms to automatically identify explicit discourse connectives and the relations they signal for Arabic text. First we show that, for Arabic news, most adjacent sentences are connected via explicit connectives in contrast to English, making the treatment of explicit discourse connectives for Arabic highly important. We also show that explicit Arabic discourse connectives are far more ambiguous than English ones, making their treatment challenging. In the second part of the paper, we present supervised algorithms to address automatic discourse connective identification and discourse relation recognition. Our connective identifier based on gold standard syntactic features achieves almost human performance. In addition, an identifier based solely on simple lexical and automatically derived morphological and POS features performs with high reliability, essential for languages that do not have high-quality parsers yet. Our algorithm for recognizing discourse relations performs significantly better than a baseline based on the connective surface string alone and therefore reduces the ambiguity in explicit connective interpretation.</p><p>4 0.79740512 <a title="121-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Third-order_Variational_Reranking_on_Packed-Shared_Dependency_Forests.html">134 emnlp-2011-Third-order Variational Reranking on Packed-Shared Dependency Forests</a></p>
<p>Author: Katsuhiko Hayashi ; Taro Watanabe ; Masayuki Asahara ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel forest reranking algorithm for discriminative dependency parsing based on a variant of Eisner’s generative model. In our framework, we define two kinds of generative model for reranking. One is learned from training data offline and the other from a forest generated by a baseline parser on the fly. The final prediction in the reranking stage is performed using linear interpolation of these models and discriminative model. In order to efficiently train the model from and decode on a hypergraph data structure representing a forest, we apply extended inside/outside and Viterbi algorithms. Experimental results show that our proposed forest reranking algorithm achieves significant improvement when compared with conventional approaches.</p><p>5 0.71594554 <a title="121-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Simple_Word_Trigger_Method_for_Social_Tag_Suggestion.html">11 emnlp-2011-A Simple Word Trigger Method for Social Tag Suggestion</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiyuan Liu ; Xinxiong Chen ; Maosong Sun</p><p>Abstract: It is popular for users in Web 2.0 era to freely annotate online resources with tags. To ease the annotation process, it has been great interest in automatic tag suggestion. We propose a method to suggest tags according to the text description of a resource. By considering both the description and tags of a given resource as summaries to the resource written in two languages, we adopt word alignment models in statistical machine translation to bridge their vocabulary gap. Based on the translation probabilities between the words in descriptions and the tags estimated on a large set of description-tags pairs, we build a word trigger method (WTM) to suggest tags according to the words in a resource description. Experiments on real world datasets show that WTM is effective and robust compared with other methods. Moreover, WTM is relatively simple and efficient, which is practical for Web applications.</p><p>6 0.69485641 <a title="121-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Discovering_Relations_between_Noun_Categories.html">40 emnlp-2011-Discovering Relations between Noun Categories</a></p>

<p>Author: Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple objective function that when optimized yields accurate solutions to both decipherment and cognate pair identification problems. The objective simultaneously scores a matching between two alphabets and a matching between two lexicons, each in a different language. We introduce a simple coordinate descent procedure that efficiently finds effective solutions to the resulting combinatorial optimization problem. Our system requires only a list of words in both languages as input, yet it competes with and surpasses several state-of-the-art systems that are both substantially more complex and make use of more information.</p><p>3 0.053730298 <a title="77-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Structured_Sparsity_in_Structured_Prediction.html">129 emnlp-2011-Structured Sparsity in Structured Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Andre Martins ; Noah Smith ; Mario Figueiredo ; Pedro Aguiar</p><p>Abstract: Linear models have enjoyed great success in structured prediction in NLP. While a lot of progress has been made on efficient training with several loss functions, the problem of endowing learners with a mechanism for feature selection is still unsolved. Common approaches employ ad hoc filtering or L1regularization; both ignore the structure of the feature space, preventing practicioners from encoding structural prior knowledge. We fill this gap by adopting regularizers that promote structured sparsity, along with efficient algorithms to handle them. Experiments on three tasks (chunking, entity recognition, and dependency parsing) show gains in performance, compactness, and model interpretability.</p><p>4 0.044608921 <a title="77-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Predicting_Sentiment_Distributions.html">120 emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoders for Predicting Sentiment Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Jeffrey Pennington ; Eric H. Huang ; Andrew Y. Ng ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning framework based on recursive autoencoders for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label distributions. Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the modelâ€™s ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures emotional reactions.

<p>Author: Chao Shen ; Tao Li</p><p>Abstract: In active dual supervision, not only informative examples but also features are selected for labeling to build a high quality classifier with low cost. However, how to measure the informativeness for both examples and feature on the same scale has not been well solved. In this paper, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization based approach to address this issue. We first extend the matrix factorization framework to explicitly model the corresponding relationships between feature classes and examples classes. Then by making use of the reconstruction error, we propose a unified scheme to determine which feature or example a classifier is most likely to benefit from having labeled. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p><p>6 0.036627319 <a title="77-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Structure_Prediction_with_Non-Parallel_Multilingual_Guidance.html">146 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Structure Prediction with Non-Parallel Multilingual Guidance</a></p>

Using Word Lengthening to Detect Sentiment in Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel Brody ; Nicholas Diakopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method which leverages word lengthening to adapt a sentiment lexicon specifically for Twitter and similar social messaging networks. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we call attention to lengthening as a widespread phenomenon in microblogs and social messaging, and demonstrate the importance of handling it correctly. We then show that lengthening is strongly associated with subjectivity and sentiment. Finally, we present an automatic method which leverages this association to detect domain-specific sentiment- and emotionbearing words. We evaluate our method by comparison to human judgments, and analyze its strengths and weaknesses. Our results are of interest to anyone analyzing sentiment in microblogs and social networks, whether for research or commercial purposes.</p><p>5 0.098039113 <a title="77-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Predicting_Sentiment_Distributions.html">120 emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoders for Predicting Sentiment Distributions</a></p>

Word aligners that model the alignment matrix can express arbitrary alignments, but are difficult to decode. We propose an alignment matrix model as a correction algorithm to an underlying sequencebased aligner. Then a greedy decoding algorithm enables the full expressive power of the alignment matrix formulation. Improved alignment performance is shown for all nine language pairs tested. The improved alignments also improved translation quality from Chinese to English and English to Italian.</p><p>3 0.45882109 <a title="77-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Predicting_Sentiment_Distributions.html">120 emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoders for Predicting Sentiment Distributions</a></p>

<p>Author: Yugo Murawaki ; Sadao Kurohashi</p><p>Abstract: A key factor of high quality word segmentation for Japanese is a high-coverage dictionary, but it is costly to manually build such a lexical resource. Although external lexical resources for human readers are potentially good knowledge sources, they have not been utilized due to differences in segmentation criteria. To supplement a morphological dictionary with these resources, we propose a new task of Japanese noun phrase segmentation. We apply non-parametric Bayesian language models to segment each noun phrase in these resources according to the statistical behavior of its supposed constituents in text. For inference, we propose a novel block sampling procedure named hybrid type-based sampling, which has the ability to directly escape a local optimum that is not too distant from the global optimum. Experiments show that the proposed method efficiently corrects the initial segmentation given by a morphological ana- lyzer.</p><p>5 0.45735177 <a title="77-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Learning_Sentential_Paraphrases_from_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Text-to-Text_Generation.html">83 emnlp-2011-Learning Sentential Paraphrases from Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Text-to-Text Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Juri Ganitkevitch ; Chris Callison-Burch ; Courtney Napoles ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: Previous work has shown that high quality phrasal paraphrases can be extracted from bilingual parallel corpora. However, it is not clear whether bitexts are an appropriate resource for extracting more sophisticated sentential paraphrases, which are more obviously learnable from monolingual parallel corpora. We extend bilingual paraphrase extraction to syntactic paraphrases and demonstrate its ability to learn a variety of general paraphrastic transformations, including passivization, dative shift, and topicalization. We discuss how our model can be adapted to many text generation tasks by augmenting its feature set, development data, and parameter estimation routine. We illustrate this adaptation by using our paraphrase model for the task of sentence compression and achieve results competitive with state-of-the-art compression systems.</p><p>6 0.45720518 <a title="77-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Fast_Generation_of_Translation_Forest_for_Large-Scale_SMT_Discriminative_Training.html">58 emnlp-2011-Fast Generation of Translation Forest for Large-Scale SMT Discriminative Training</a></p>

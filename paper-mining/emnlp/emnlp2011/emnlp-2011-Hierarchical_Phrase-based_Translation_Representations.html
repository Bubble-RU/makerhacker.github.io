<p>Author: Anoop Deoras ; Tomas Mikolov ; Kenneth Church</p><p>Abstract: A re-scoring strategy is proposed that makes it feasible to capture more long-distance dependencies in the natural language. Two pass strategies have become popular in a number of recognition tasks such as ASR (automatic speech recognition), MT (machine translation) and OCR (optical character recognition). The first pass typically applies a weak language model (n-grams) to a lattice and the second pass applies a stronger language model to N best lists. The stronger language model is intended to capture more longdistance dependencies. The proposed method uses RNN-LM (recurrent neural network language model), which is a long span LM, to rescore word lattices in the second pass. A hill climbing method (iterative decoding) is proposed to search over islands of confusability in the word lattice. An evaluation based on Broadcast News shows speedups of 20 over basic N best re-scoring, and word error rate reduction of 8% (relative) on a highly competitive setup.</p><p>3 0.1221326 <a title="66-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Exact_Inference_for_Generative_Probabilistic_Non-Projective_Dependency_Parsing.html">52 emnlp-2011-Exact Inference for Generative Probabilistic Non-Projective Dependency Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Yin-Wen Chang ; Michael Collins</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes an algorithm for exact decoding of phrase-based translation models, based on Lagrangian relaxation. The method recovers exact solutions, with certificates of optimality, on over 99% of test examples. The method is much more efficient than approaches based on linear programming (LP) or integer linear programming (ILP) solvers: these methods are not feasible for anything other than short sentences. We compare our method to MOSES (Koehn et al., 2007), and give precise estimates of the number and magnitude of search errors that MOSES makes.</p><p>5 0.10844424 <a title="66-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Heuristic_Search_for_Non-Bottom-Up_Tree_Structure_Prediction.html">65 emnlp-2011-Heuristic Search for Non-Bottom-Up Tree Structure Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Gesmundo ; James Henderson</p><p>Abstract: State of the art Tree Structures Prediction techniques rely on bottom-up decoding. These approaches allow the use of context-free features and bottom-up features. We discuss the limitations of mainstream techniques in solving common Natural Language Processing tasks. Then we devise a new framework that goes beyond Bottom-up Decoding, and that allows a better integration of contextual features. Furthermore we design a system that addresses these issues and we test it on Hierarchical Machine Translation, a well known tree structure prediction problem. The structure of the proposed system allows the incorporation of non-bottom-up features and relies on a more sophisticated decoding approach. We show that the proposed approach can find bet- ter translations using a smaller portion of the search space.</p><p>6 0.1014724 <a title="66-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Computation_of_Infix_Probabilities_for_Probabilistic_Context-Free_Grammars.html">31 emnlp-2011-Computation of Infix Probabilities for Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars</a></p>

<p>Author: Peng Li ; Yinglin Wang ; Wei Gao ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatic generation of aspect-oriented summaries from multiple documents. We first develop an event-aspect LDA model to cluster sentences into aspects. We then use extended LexRank algorithm to rank the sentences in each cluster. We use Integer Linear Programming for sentence selection. Key features of our method include automatic grouping of semantically related sentences and sentence ranking based on extension of random walk model. Also, we implement a new sentence compression algorithm which use dependency tree instead of parser tree. We compare our method with four baseline methods. Quantitative evaluation based on Rouge metric demonstrates the effectiveness and advantages of our method.</p><p>3 0.65360457 <a title="66-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Universal_Morphological_Analysis_using_Structured_Nearest_Neighbor_Prediction.html">140 emnlp-2011-Universal Morphological Analysis using Structured Nearest Neighbor Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Young-Bum Kim ; Joao Graca ; Benjamin Snyder</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of unsupervised morphological analysis from a new angle. Past work has endeavored to design unsupervised learning methods which explicitly or implicitly encode inductive biases appropriate to the task at hand. We propose instead to treat morphological analysis as a structured prediction problem, where languages with labeled data serve as training examples for unlabeled languages, without the assumption of parallel data. We define a universal morphological feature space in which every language and its morphological analysis reside. We develop a novel structured nearest neighbor prediction method which seeks to find the morphological analysis for each unlabeled lan- guage which lies as close as possible in the feature space to a training language. We apply our model to eight inflecting languages, and induce nominal morphology with substantially higher accuracy than a traditional, MDLbased approach. Our analysis indicates that accuracy continues to improve substantially as the number of training languages increases.</p><p>4 0.50239909 <a title="66-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Ranking_Human_and_Machine_Summarization_Systems.html">110 emnlp-2011-Ranking Human and Machine Summarization Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark-Jan Nederhof ; Giorgio Satta</p><p>Abstract: The notion of infix probability has been introduced in the literature as a generalization of the notion of prefix (or initial substring) probability, motivated by applications in speech recognition and word error correction. For the case where a probabilistic context-free grammar is used as language model, methods for the computation of infix probabilities have been presented in the literature, based on various simplifying assumptions. Here we present a solution that applies to the problem in its full generality.</p><p>6 0.49069956 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Timeline_Generation_through_Evolutionary_Trans-Temporal_Summarization.html">135 emnlp-2011-Timeline Generation through Evolutionary Trans-Temporal Summarization</a></p>

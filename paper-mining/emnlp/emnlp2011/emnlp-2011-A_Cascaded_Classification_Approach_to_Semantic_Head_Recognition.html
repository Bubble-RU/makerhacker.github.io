<p>Author: Jun Xie ; Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Dependency structure, as a first step towards semantics, is believed to be helpful to improve translation quality. However, previous works on dependency structure based models typically resort to insertion operations to complete translations, which make it difficult to specify ordering information in translation rules. In our model of this paper, we handle this problem by directly specifying the ordering information in head-dependents rules which represent the source side as head-dependents relations and the target side as strings. The head-dependents rules require only substitution operation, thus our model requires no heuristics or separate ordering models of the previous works to control the word order of translations. Large-scale experiments show that our model performs well on long distance reordering, and outperforms the state- of-the-art constituency-to-string model (+1.47 BLEU on average) and hierarchical phrasebased model (+0.46 BLEU on average) on two Chinese-English NIST test sets without resort to phrases or parse forest. For the first time, a source dependency structure based model catches up with and surpasses the state-of-theart translation models.</p><p>3 0.094851188 <a title="2-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Multilayer_Sequence_Labeling.html">96 emnlp-2011-Multilayer Sequence Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Ai Azuma ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we describe a novel approach to cascaded learning and inference on sequences. We propose a weakly joint learning model on cascaded inference on sequences, called multilayer sequence labeling. In this model, inference on sequences is modeled as cascaded decision. However, the decision on a sequence labeling sequel to other decisions utilizes the features on the preceding results as marginalized by the probabilistic models on them. It is not novel itself, but our idea central to this paper is that the probabilistic models on succeeding labeling are viewed as indirectly depending on the probabilistic models on preceding analyses. We also propose two types of efficient dynamic programming which are required in the gradient-based optimization of an objective function. One of the dynamic programming algorithms resembles back propagation algorithm for mul- tilayer feed-forward neural networks. The other is a generalized version of the forwardbackward algorithm. We also report experiments of cascaded part-of-speech tagging and chunking of English sentences and show effectiveness of the proposed method.</p><p>4 0.092216298 <a title="2-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Large-Scale_Noun_Compound_Interpretation_Using_Bootstrapping_and_the_Web_as_a_Corpus.html">78 emnlp-2011-Large-Scale Noun Compound Interpretation Using Bootstrapping and the Web as a Corpus</a></p>
<p>Author: Su Nam Kim ; Preslav Nakov</p><p>Abstract: Responding to the need for semantic lexical resources in natural language processing applications, we examine methods to acquire noun compounds (NCs), e.g., orange juice, together with suitable fine-grained semantic interpretations, e.g., squeezed from, which are directly usable as paraphrases. We employ bootstrapping and web statistics, and utilize the relationship between NCs and paraphrasing patterns to jointly extract NCs and such patterns in multiple alternating iterations. In evaluation, we found that having one compound noun fixed yields both a higher number of semantically interpreted NCs and improved accuracy due to stronger semantic restrictions.</p><p>5 0.089218438 <a title="2-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Experimental_Support_for_a_Categorical_Compositional_Distributional_Model_of_Meaning.html">53 emnlp-2011-Experimental Support for a Categorical Compositional Distributional Model of Meaning</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard Farkas</p><p>Abstract: Information-oriented document labeling is a special document multi-labeling task where the target labels refer to a specific information instead of the topic of the whole document. These kind oftasks are usually solved by looking up indicator phrases and analyzing their local context to filter false positive matches. Here, we introduce an approach for machine learning local content shifters which detects irrelevant local contexts using just the original document-level training labels. We handle content shifters in general, instead of learning a particular language phenomenon detector (e.g. negation or hedging) and form a single system for document labeling and content shift detection. Our empirical results achieved 24% error reduction compared to supervised baseline methods – on three document label– ing tasks.</p><p>3 0.42727914 <a title="2-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Efficient_retrieval_of_tree_translation_examples_for_Syntax-Based_Machine_Translation.html">47 emnlp-2011-Efficient retrieval of tree translation examples for Syntax-Based Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning factored probabilistic CCG grammars for semantic parsing from data containing sentences paired with logical-form meaning representations. Traditional CCG lexicons list lexical items that pair words and phrases with syntactic and semantic content. Such lexicons can be inefficient when words appear repeatedly with closely related lexical content. In this paper, we introduce factored lexicons, which include both lexemes to model word meaning and templates to model systematic variation in word usage. We also present an algorithm for learning factored CCG lexicons, along with a probabilistic parse-selection model. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach learns highly accurate parsers, whose generalization performance greatly from the lexical factoring. benefits</p><p>3 0.53434694 <a title="2-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Predicting_Sentiment_Distributions.html">120 emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoders for Predicting Sentiment Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Jeffrey Pennington ; Eric H. Huang ; Andrew Y. Ng ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning framework based on recursive autoencoders for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label distributions. Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the model’s ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures emotional reactions. Our algorithm can more accurately predict distributions over such labels compared to several competitive baselines.</p><p>4 0.53210175 <a title="2-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Identification_of_Multi-word_Expressions_by_Combining_Multiple_Linguistic_Information_Sources.html">69 emnlp-2011-Identification of Multi-word Expressions by Combining Multiple Linguistic Information Sources</a></p>
<p>Author: Yulia Tsvetkov ; Shuly Wintner</p><p>Abstract: We propose an architecture for expressing various linguistically-motivated features that help identify multi-word expressions in natural language texts. The architecture combines various linguistically-motivated classification features in a Bayesian Network. We introduce novel ways for computing many of these features, and manually define linguistically-motivated interrelationships among them, which the Bayesian network models. Our methodology is almost entirely unsupervised and completely languageindependent; it relies on few language resources and is thus suitable for a large number of languages. Furthermore, unlike much recent work, our approach can identify expressions of various types and syntactic con- structions. We demonstrate a significant improvement in identification accuracy, compared with less sophisticated baselines.</p><p>5 0.53104812 <a title="2-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Probabilistic_models_of_similarity_in_syntactic_context.html">107 emnlp-2011-Probabilistic models of similarity in syntactic context</a></p>
<p>Author: Diarmuid O Seaghdha ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates novel methods for incorporating syntactic information in probabilistic latent variable models of lexical choice and contextual similarity. The resulting models capture the effects of context on the interpretation of a word and in particular its effect on the appropriateness of replacing that word with a potentially related one. Evaluating our techniques on two datasets, we report performance above the prior state of the art for estimating sentence similarity and ranking lexical substitutes.</p><p>6 0.53079879 <a title="2-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Cooooooooooooooollllllllllllll%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21_Using_Word_Lengthening_to_Detect_Sentiment_in_Microblogs.html">33 emnlp-2011-Cooooooooooooooollllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Using Word Lengthening to Detect Sentiment in Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel Brody ; Nicholas Diakopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method which leverages word lengthening to adapt a sentiment lexicon specifically for Twitter and similar social messaging networks. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we call attention to lengthening as a widespread phenomenon in microblogs and social messaging, and demonstrate the importance of handling it correctly. We then show that lengthening is strongly associated with subjectivity and sentiment. Finally, we present an automatic method which leverages this association to detect domain-specific sentiment- and emotionbearing words. We evaluate our method by comparison to human judgments, and analyze its strengths and weaknesses. Our results are of interest to anyone analyzing sentiment in microblogs and social networks, whether for research or commercial purposes.</p><p>3 0.18401633 <a title="126-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Predicting_Sentiment_Distributions.html">120 emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoders for Predicting Sentiment Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Jeffrey Pennington ; Eric H. Huang ; Andrew Y. Ng ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning framework based on recursive autoencoders for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label distributions. Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the model’s ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures emotional reactions. Our algorithm can more accurately predict distributions over such labels compared to several competitive baselines.</p><p>4 0.18208544 <a title="126-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Compositional_Matrix-Space_Models_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">30 emnlp-2011-Compositional Matrix-Space Models for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: We present a general learning-based approach for phrase-level sentiment analysis that adopts an ordinal sentiment scale and is explicitly compositional in nature. Thus, we can model the compositional effects required for accurate assignment of phrase-level sentiment. For example, combining an adverb (e.g., “very”) with a positive polar adjective (e.g., “good”) produces a phrase (“very good”) with increased polarity over the adjective alone. Inspired by recent work on distributional approaches to compositionality, we model each word as a matrix and combine words using iterated matrix multiplication, which allows for the modeling of both additive and multiplicative semantic effects. Although the multiplication-based matrix-space framework has been shown to be a theoretically elegant way to model composition (Rudolph and Giesbrecht, 2010), training such models has to be done carefully: the optimization is nonconvex and requires a good initial starting point. This paper presents the first such algorithm for learning a matrix-space model for semantic composition. In the context of the phrase-level sentiment analysis task, our experimental results show statistically significant improvements in performance over a bagof-words model.</p><p>5 0.16925749 <a title="126-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Predicting_Thread_Discourse_Structure_over_Technical_Web_Forums.html">105 emnlp-2011-Predicting Thread Discourse Structure over Technical Web Forums</a></p>
<p>Author: Li Wang ; Marco Lui ; Su Nam Kim ; Joakim Nivre ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: Online discussion forums are a valuable means for users to resolve specific information needs, both interactively for the participants and statically for users who search/browse over historical thread data. However, the complex structure of forum threads can make it difficult for users to extract relevant information. The discourse structure of web forum threads, in the form of labelled dependency relationships between posts, has the potential to greatly improve information access over web forum archives. In this paper, we present the task of parsing user forum threads to determine the labelled dependencies between posts. Three methods, including a dependency parsing approach, are proposed to jointly classify the links (relationships) between posts and the dialogue act (type) of each link. The proposed methods significantly surpass an informed baseline. We also experiment with “in situ” classification of evolving threads, and establish that our best methods are able to perform equivalently well over partial threads as complete threads.</p><p>6 0.14505021 <a title="126-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Personalized_Recommendation_of_User_Comments_via_Factor_Models.html">104 emnlp-2011-Personalized Recommendation of User Comments via Factor Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Jette Viethen ; Robert Dale ; Markus Guhe</p><p>Abstract: Traditional computational approaches to referring expression generation operate in a deliberate manner, choosing the attributes to be included on the basis of their ability to distinguish the intended referent from its distractors. However, work in psycholinguistics suggests that speakers align their referring expressions with those used previously in the discourse, implying less deliberate choice and more subconscious reuse. This raises the question as to which is a more accurate characterisation of what people do. Using a corpus of dialogues containing 16,358 referring expressions, we explore this question via the generation of subsequent references in shared visual scenes. We use a machine learning approach to referring expression generation and demonstrate that incorporating features that correspond to the computational tradition does not match human referring behaviour as well as using features corresponding to the process of alignment. The results support the view that the traditional model of referring expression generation that is widely assumed in work on natural language generation may not in fact be correct; our analysis may also help explain the oft-observed redundancy found in humanproduced referring expressions.</p><p>3 0.57974285 <a title="126-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Linking_Entities_to_a_Knowledge_Base_with_Query_Expansion.html">90 emnlp-2011-Linking Entities to a Knowledge Base with Query Expansion</a></p>
<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to entity linking based on a statistical language model-based information retrieval with query expansion. We use both local contexts and global world knowledge to expand query language models. We place a strong emphasis on named entities in the local contexts and explore a positional language model to weigh them differently based on their distances to the query. Our experiments on the TAC-KBP 2010 data show that incorporating such contextual information indeed aids in disambiguating the named entities and consistently improves the entity linking performance. Compared with the official results from KBP 2010 participants, our system shows competitive performance.</p><p>4 0.57842463 <a title="126-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Cooooooooooooooollllllllllllll%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21_Using_Word_Lengthening_to_Detect_Sentiment_in_Microblogs.html">33 emnlp-2011-Cooooooooooooooollllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Using Word Lengthening to Detect Sentiment in Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel Brody ; Nicholas Diakopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method which leverages word lengthening to adapt a sentiment lexicon specifically for Twitter and similar social messaging networks. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we call attention to lengthening as a widespread phenomenon in microblogs and social messaging, and demonstrate the importance of handling it correctly. We then show that lengthening is strongly associated with subjectivity and sentiment. Finally, we present an automatic method which leverages this association to detect domain-specific sentiment- and emotionbearing words. We evaluate our method by comparison to human judgments, and analyze its strengths and weaknesses. Our results are of interest to anyone analyzing sentiment in microblogs and social networks, whether for research or commercial purposes.</p><p>5 0.57543218 <a title="126-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Learning_to_Simplify_Sentences_with_Quasi-Synchronous_Grammar_and_Integer_Programming.html">85 emnlp-2011-Learning to Simplify Sentences with Quasi-Synchronous Grammar and Integer Programming</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristian Woodsend ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: Text simplification aims to rewrite text into simpler versions, and thus make information accessible to a broader audience. Most previous work simplifies sentences using handcrafted rules aimed at splitting long sentences, or substitutes difficult words using a predefined dictionary. This paper presents a datadriven model based on quasi-synchronous grammar, a formalism that can naturally capture structural mismatches and complex rewrite operations. We describe how such a grammar can be induced from Wikipedia and propose an integer linear programming model for selecting the most appropriate simplification from the space of possible rewrites generated by the grammar. We show experimentally that our method creates simplifications that significantly reduce the reading difficulty ofthe input, while maintaining grammaticality and preserving its meaning.</p><p>6 0.57451177 <a title="126-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Large-Scale_Noun_Compound_Interpretation_Using_Bootstrapping_and_the_Web_as_a_Corpus.html">78 emnlp-2011-Large-Scale Noun Compound Interpretation Using Bootstrapping and the Web as a Corpus</a></p>

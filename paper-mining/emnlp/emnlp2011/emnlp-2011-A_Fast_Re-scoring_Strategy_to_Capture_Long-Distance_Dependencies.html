</p><p>11 In this paper we propose an 1117 approach that keeps the model intact but approximates the search space instead (which can become intractable to handle especially under a long span model), thus enabling the use of full blown model for re-scoring. [sent-50, score-0.233]
</p><p>12 With this approach, we can achieve full lattice re-scoring with a complex model, at a cost more than 20 times less than of a naive brute force approach that is commonly used today. [sent-51, score-0.352]

</p><p>40 In the next section, we propose an algorithm which keeps the representation of search space as 1120 simple as that of N best list, but does not restrict itself to top N best paths alone and hence does not get biased towards the starting weaker model. [sent-190, score-0.3]
</p><p>41 4  Proposed Approach for Rescoring  A high level idea of our proposed approach is to identify islands of confusability in the word lattice and replace the problem of global search over word lattice by series of local search problems over these islands in an iterative manner. [sent-191, score-1.045]
</p><p>42 In this work, we propose a technique which generalizes very well on word lattices and overcomes the limitations posed by a CN or by the limited nature of local neighborhood. [sent-198, score-0.277]
</p><p>43 Thus the local neighborhood are in some sense a function of the confusability present in the lattice rather than some predetermined factor. [sent-200, score-0.492]
</p><p>44 Below we describe the process, virtue of which, we can cut the lattice to form many self contained smaller sized sub lattices. [sent-201, score-0.65]
</p><p>45 Once these sub  lattices are formed, we follow a similar hill climbing procedure as proposed in our previous work (Deoras and Jelinek, 2009). [sent-202, score-0.543]
</p><p>46 Before we define the procedure for cutting the lattice into many small self contained lattices, we will define some more terms necessary for the ease of understandability of the algorithm. [sent-206, score-0.481]
</p><p>47 p[π]=πX∈vE,n∗[π]∈Ne  A[π]γL[π]  (5)  If we define the sum of joint likelihood under the baseline acoustic and language models of all paths in the lattice by Z, then it can simply be obtained as:  Z = Pu∈Ne α(u) = β(ns)  In Pordue∈rN Nto cut the lattice, we want to identify sets of noPdes, S1, S2, . [sent-215, score-0.547]
</p><p>48 The first property can be easily checked by first pushing states into a linked list associated with each time marker (this can be done by iterating over all the states of the graph) then iterating over the unique time markers and retrieving back the nodes associated with it. [sent-223, score-0.206]
</p><p>49 Thus effectively, the time complexity for cutting the lattice is O( |V| + |E| ). [sent-230, score-0.424]
</p><p>50 Having formed such sets, we can now cut the lattice at time stamps associated with these sets i. [sent-231, score-0.444]
</p><p>51 n,eLd lattices yet by simply cutting the parent lattice at the cut points. [sent-245, score-0.746]
</p><p>52 −  Once we cut the lattice at these cut points, we implicitly introduce many new starting nodes and ending nodes for any sub lattice. [sent-246, score-0.912]
</p><p>53 We will refer to these  nodes as exposed starting nodes and exposed ending nodes. [sent-247, score-0.481]
</p><p>54 Thus for some jth sub lattice, Lj, there will be as many new exposed starting tnicodee,s L as there are nodes in the set Sj and as many exposed ending nodes as there are nodes in the set Sj+1. [sent-248, score-0.749]
</p><p>55 In order to make these sub lattices consistent with the definition of a word lattice (see Sec. [sent-249, score-0.79]
</p><p>56 1), we unify all the exposed starting nodes and exposed ending nodes. [sent-251, score-0.451]
</p><p>57 To unify the exposed starting nodes, we introduce as many new edges as there are nodes in the set Sj such that they have a common starting node, ns [Lj], (newly created) and distinct ending nodes present in Sj. [sent-252, score-0.597]

</p><p>59 From the totality of these new edges and nodes along with the ones already present in Lj forms an induced directed acyclic subgraph G[Lj] = (V[Lj] , E[Lj] , ns [Lj] , ne [Lj] ). [sent-255, score-0.239]
</p><p>60 For any path π ∈ E[Lj] such that p[π] = ns [Lj] andF n[π] ∈ Sj, we assign the value of α(n[π]) taon dde nn[oπt]e ∈the joint likelihood A[π]γL[π] and as-  sign epsilon for word associated with these edges i. [sent-256, score-0.258]
</p><p>61 Similarly, dfeorn any path π ∈ E[Lj] such that p[π] ∈ Sj+1 and n[π] = ne [Lj], we assign the value of β(p[π])6 to denote the joint likelihood A[π]γL[π] and assign epsilon for word associated with these edges i. [sent-260, score-0.275]
</p><p>62 , LC, where C is the total number of sub lLatt,iLces, formed, then the idea is to divide the rescoring problem into many small re-scoring problems carried over the sub lattices one at a time by fixing single best paths from all the remaining sub lattices. [sent-269, score-1.116]
</p><p>63 The inputs to the algorithm are the sub lattices (produced by cutting the parent lattice generated under some Markov n-gram LM) and a new rescoring LM, which now need not be restricted to finite state machine family. [sent-270, score-1.077]
</p><p>64 The output of the al-  gorithm is a word string, W∗, such that it is the concatenation of final decoded word strings from each sub lattice. [sent-271, score-0.285]
</p><p>65 Thus if we denote the final decoded path (under some decoding scheme, which will become apparent next) in the jth sub lattice by πj∗ and the concatenation symbol by ’ ·’, then W∗ = W[π1∗] ·W[π2∗] ·. [sent-272, score-0.897]
</p><p>66 e  1122 The algorithm is initialized by setting PrevHypo to null and CurrHypo to the concatenation of 1-best output from each sub lattice. [sent-302, score-0.242]
</p><p>67 During the initialization step, each sub lattice is analyzed independent of any other sub lattice and under the baseline acoustic scores and baseline n-gram LM scores, 1-best path is found out. [sent-303, score-1.318]
</p><p>68 Once all the sub lattices are re-scored, that constitutes one iteration. [sent-313, score-0.438]
</p><p>69 At the end of each iteration, CurrHypo is set to the concatenation of 1 best paths from each sub lattice while PrevHypo is set to the old value of CurrHypo. [sent-314, score-0.7]
</p><p>70 Thus if we are analyzing some ith sub-lattice in some iteration, then 1-best paths from all but this sub-lattice is kept fixed and a new 1-best  path under the re-scoring LM is found out. [sent-315, score-0.215]
</p><p>71 Since the cutting of parent lattices produce many small lattices with considerably lesser number of nodes, in practice, an exhaustive search for the 1best hypothesis can be carried out via N best list. [sent-317, score-0.676]
</p><p>72 Entropy of a lattice reflects the confidence of the recognizer in recognizing the acoustics. [sent-321, score-0.43]
</p><p>73 Based on the observation that if the N best list / lattice generated under some model has a very low entropy, then the Spearman’s rank correlation factor, ρ (Eqn. [sent-322, score-0.527]
</p><p>74 3), tends to be higher even when the N best lists / lattice is re-ranked with a bigger and a better model. [sent-323, score-0.491]
</p><p>75 We can see from Table 2 that the rank correlation values tend to be higher (indicating little re-rankings) when the entropy of the N best list, under the baseline model, is lower. [sent-332, score-0.225]
</p><p>76 Of course, if the starting LM is much weaker than the rescoring model, then the entropy values need not be reflective of the difficulty of the overall task. [sent-335, score-0.388]
</p><p>77 This observation then suggests that it is safe to rescore only those N best lists whose entropy under the starting model is higher than some threshold. [sent-336, score-0.255]
</p><p>78 While computation of entropy for N best list is tractable, for a word lattice, the computation of entropy is intractable if one were to enumerate all the hypotheses. [sent-343, score-0.277]
</p><p>79 Using efficient semiring techniques introduced by Li and Eisner (2009) or using posterior probabilities on the edges leading to end states, we can compute the entropy of a lattice in one single forward pass using dynamic programming. [sent-345, score-0.567]
</p><p>80 One has to resort to  approximate entropy computation via N best list, if entropy under long span LM is desired. [sent-347, score-0.414]
</p><p>81 Once we have formed self contained sub lattices, we want to prune all but the top few best complete paths (obtained un1123 der baseline / starting model) of those sub lattices whose entropy is below some threshold. [sent-351, score-1.003]
</p><p>82 Thus, believing in the original model’s confidence, we want to focus only on those sub lattices which the recognizer found difficult to decode in the first pass. [sent-352, score-0.516]

<p>Author: Anoop Deoras ; Tomas Mikolov ; Kenneth Church</p><p>Abstract: A re-scoring strategy is proposed that makes it feasible to capture more long-distance dependencies in the natural language. Two pass strategies have become popular in a number of recognition tasks such as ASR (automatic speech recognition), MT (machine translation) and OCR (optical character recognition). The first pass typically applies a weak language model (n-grams) to a lattice and the second pass applies a stronger language model to N best lists. The stronger language model is intended to capture more longdistance dependencies.

<p>Author: Denis Filimonov ; Mary Harper</p><p>Abstract: Decision trees have been applied to a variety of NLP tasks, including language modeling, for their ability to handle a variety of attributes and sparse context space. Moreover, forests (collections of decision trees) have been shown to substantially outperform individual decision trees. In this work, we investigate methods for combining trees in a forest, as well as methods for diversifying trees for the task of syntactic language modeling. We show that our tree interpolation technique outperforms the standard method used in the literature, and that, on this particular task, restricting tree contexts in a principled way produces smaller and better forests, with the best achieving an 8% relative reduction in Word Error Rate over an n-gram baseline.</p><p>5 0.1070381 <a title="5-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Efficient_Subsampling_for_Training_Complex_Language_Models.html">46 emnlp-2011-Efficient Subsampling for Training Complex Language Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Anoop Deoras ; Tomas Mikolov ; Kenneth Church</p><p>Abstract: A re-scoring strategy is proposed that makes it feasible to capture more long-distance dependencies in the natural language. Two pass strategies have become popular in a number of recognition tasks such as ASR (automatic speech recognition), MT (machine translation) and OCR (optical character recognition). The first pass typically applies a weak language model (n-grams) to a lattice and the second pass applies a stronger language model to N best lists. The stronger language model is intended to capture more longdistance dependencies.

<p>Author: Andrea Gesmundo ; James Henderson</p><p>Abstract: State of the art Tree Structures Prediction techniques rely on bottom-up decoding. These approaches allow the use of context-free features and bottom-up features. We discuss the limitations of mainstream techniques in solving common Natural Language Processing tasks. Then we devise a new framework that goes beyond Bottom-up Decoding, and that allows a better integration of contextual features. Furthermore we design a system that addresses these issues and we test it on Hierarchical Machine Translation, a well known tree structure prediction problem. The structure of the proposed system allows the incorporation of non-bottom-up features and relies on a more sophisticated decoding approach. We show that the proposed approach can find bet- ter translations using a smaller portion of the search space.</p><p>4 0.53552711 <a title="5-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Hierarchical_Phrase-based_Translation_Representations.html">66 emnlp-2011-Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation Representations</a></p>

<p>Author: John DeNero ; Jakob Uszkoreit</p><p>Abstract: When translating among languages that differ substantially in word order, machine translation (MT) systems benefit from syntactic preordering—an approach that uses features from a syntactic parse to permute source words into a target-language-like order. This paper presents a method for inducing parse trees automatically from a parallel corpus, instead of using a supervised parser trained on a treebank. These induced parses are used to preorder source sentences. We demonstrate that our induced parser is effective: it not only improves a state-of-the-art phrase-based system with integrated reordering, but also approaches the performance of a recent preordering method based on a supervised parser. These results show that the syntactic structure which is relevant to MT pre-ordering can be learned automatically from parallel text, thus establishing a new application for unsupervised grammar induction.</p><p>3 0.81661361 <a title="5-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Weakly-supervised_Approach_to_Argumentative_Zoning_of_Scientific_Documents.html">12 emnlp-2011-A Weakly-supervised Approach to Argumentative Zoning of Scientific Documents</a></p>

Current approaches to AZ rely on supervised machine learning (ML). – – Requiring large amounts of annotated data, these approaches are expensive to develop and port to different domains and tasks. A potential solution to this problem is to use weaklysupervised ML instead. We investigate the performance of four weakly-supervised classifiers on scientific abstract data annotated for multiple AZ classes. Our best classifier based on the combination of active learning and selftraining outperforms our best supervised classifier, yielding a high accuracy of 81% when using just 10% of the labeled data.

<p>Author: Marco Dinarelli ; Sophie Rosset</p><p>Abstract: Reranking models have been successfully applied to many tasks of Natural Language Processing. However, there are two aspects of this approach that need a deeper investigation: (i) Assessment of hypotheses generated for reranking at classification phase: baseline models generate a list of hypotheses and these are used for reranking without any assessment; (ii) Detection of cases where reranking models provide a worst result: the best hypothesis provided by the reranking model is assumed to be always the best result. In some cases the reranking model provides an incorrect hypothesis while the baseline best hypothesis is correct, especially when baseline models are accurate. In this paper we propose solutions for these two aspects: (i) a semantic inconsistency metric to select possibly more correct n-best hypotheses, from a large set generated by an SLU basiline model. The selected hypotheses are reranked applying a state-of-the-art model based on Partial Tree Kernels, which encode SLU hypotheses in Support Vector Machines with complex structured features; (ii) finally, we apply a decision strategy, based on confidence values, to select the final hypothesis between the first ranked hypothesis provided by the baseline SLU model and the first ranked hypothesis provided by the re-ranker. We show the effectiveness of these solutions presenting comparative results obtained reranking hypotheses generated by a very accurate Conditional Random Field model. We evaluate our approach on the French MEDIA corpus. The results show significant improvements with respect to current state-of-the-art and previous 1104 Sophie Rosset LIMSI-CNRS B.P. 133, 91403 Orsay Cedex France ro s set @ l ims i fr . re-ranking models.</p><p>5 0.49366191 <a title="5-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Efficient_Subsampling_for_Training_Complex_Language_Models.html">46 emnlp-2011-Efficient Subsampling for Training Complex Language Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Ni Lao ; Tom Mitchell ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: t om . We consider the problem of performing learning and inference in a large scale knowledge base containing imperfect knowledge with incomplete coverage. We show that a soft inference procedure based on a combination of constrained, weighted, random walks through the knowledge base graph can be used to reliably infer new beliefs for the knowledge base. More specifically, we show that the system can learn to infer different target relations by tuning the weights associated with random walks that follow different paths through the graph, using a version of the Path Ranking Algorithm (Lao and Cohen, 2010b). We apply this approach to a knowledge base of approximately 500,000 beliefs extracted imperfectly from the web by NELL, a never-ending language learner (Carlson et al., 2010). This new system improves significantly over NELLâ€™s earlier Horn-clause learning and inference method: it obtains nearly double the precision at rank 100, and the new learning method is also applicable to many more inference tasks.</p><p>3 0.084578723 <a title="40-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Extreme_Extraction_-_Machine_Reading_in_a_Week.html">57 emnlp-2011-Extreme Extraction - Machine Reading in a Week</a></p>

<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Aria Haghighi ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We explore unsupervised approaches to relation extraction between two named entities; for instance, the semantic bornIn relation between a person and location entity. Concretely, we propose a series of generative probabilistic models, broadly similar to topic models, each which generates a corpus of observed triples of entity mention pairs and the surface syntactic dependency path between them. The output of each model is a clustering of observed relation tuples and their associated textual expressions to underlying semantic relation types. Our proposed models exploit entity type constraints within a relation as well as features on the dependency path between entity mentions. We examine effectiveness of our approach via multiple evaluations and demonstrate 12% error reduction in precision over a state-of-the-art weakly supervised baseline.</p><p>6 0.066599131 <a title="40-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Relation_Acquisition_using_Word_Classes_and_Partial_Patterns.html">113 emnlp-2011-Relation Acquisition using Word Classes and Partial Patterns</a></p>

<p>Author: Chang Wang ; James Fan ; Aditya Kalyanpur ; David Gondek</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a novel approach to the semantic relation detection problem. Instead of relying only on the training instances for a new relation, we leverage the knowledge learned from previously trained relation detectors. Specifically, we detect a new semantic relation by projecting the new relationâ€™s training instances onto a lower dimension topic space constructed from existing relation detectors through a three step process. First, we construct a large relation repository of more than 7,000 relations from Wikipedia. Second, we construct a set of non-redundant relation topics defined at multiple scales from the relation repository to characterize the existing relations. Similar to the topics defined over words, each relation topic is an interpretable multinomial distribution over the existing relations. Third, we integrate the relation topics in a kernel function, and use it together with SVM to construct detectors for new relations. The experimental results on Wikipedia and ACE data have confirmed that backgroundknowledge-based topics generated from the Wikipedia relation repository can significantly improve the performance over the state-of-theart relation detection approaches.</p><p>4 0.23843728 <a title="40-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Extreme_Extraction_-_Machine_Reading_in_a_Week.html">57 emnlp-2011-Extreme Extraction - Machine Reading in a Week</a></p>

<p>Author: Thahir Mohamed ; Estevam Hruschka ; Tom Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to Relation Extraction from text require manually defining the relations to be extracted. We propose here an approach to automatically discovering relevant relations, given a large text corpus plus an initial ontology defining hundreds of noun categories (e.g., Athlete, Musician, Instrument). Our approach discovers frequently stated relations between pairs of these categories, using a two step process. For each pair of categories (e.g., Musician and Instrument) it first coclusters the text contexts that connect known instances of the two categories, generating a candidate relation for each resulting cluster. It then applies a trained classifier to determine which of these candidate relations is semantically valid. Our experiments apply this to a text corpus containing approximately 200 million web pages and an ontology containing 122 categories from the NELL system [Carlson et al., 2010b], producing a set of 781 proposed can- didate relations, approximately half of which are semantically valid. We conclude this is a useful approach to semi-automatic extension of the ontology for large-scale information extraction systems such as NELL. 1</p><p>2 0.34526065 <a title="40-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_dependency_parsers_by_jointly_optimizing_multiple_objectives.html">137 emnlp-2011-Training dependency parsers by jointly optimizing multiple objectives</a></p>
<p>Author: Keith Hall ; Ryan McDonald ; Jason Katz-Brown ; Michael Ringgaard</p><p>Abstract: We present an online learning algorithm for training parsers which allows for the inclusion of multiple objective functions. The primary example is the extension of a standard supervised parsing objective function with additional loss-functions, either based on intrinsic parsing quality or task-specific extrinsic measures of quality. Our empirical results show how this approach performs for two dependency parsing algorithms (graph-based and transition-based parsing) and how it achieves increased performance on multiple target tasks including reordering for machine translation and parser adaptation.</p><p>3 0.24191347 <a title="40-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_a_Parser_for_Machine_Translation_Reordering.html">136 emnlp-2011-Training a Parser for Machine Translation Reordering</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Katz-Brown ; Slav Petrov ; Ryan McDonald ; Franz Och ; David Talbot ; Hiroshi Ichikawa ; Masakazu Seno ; Hideto Kazawa</p><p>Abstract: We propose a simple training regime that can improve the extrinsic performance of a parser, given only a corpus of sentences and a way to automatically evaluate the extrinsic quality of a candidate parse. We apply our method to train parsers that excel when used as part of a reordering component in a statistical machine translation system. We use a corpus of weakly-labeled reference reorderings to guide parser training. Our best parsers contribute significant improvements in subjective translation quality while their intrinsic attachment scores typically regress.</p><p>4 0.23347534 <a title="40-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Optimal_Search_for_Minimum_Error_Rate_Training.html">100 emnlp-2011-Optimal Search for Minimum Error Rate Training</a></p>
<p>Author: Michel Galley ; Chris Quirk</p><p>Abstract: Minimum error rate training is a crucial component to many state-of-the-art NLP applications, such as machine translation and speech recognition. However, common evaluation functions such as BLEU or word error rate are generally highly non-convex and thus prone to search errors. In this paper, we present LP-MERT, an exact search algorithm for minimum error rate training that reaches the global optimum using a series of reductions to linear programming. Given a set of N-best lists produced from S input sentences, this algorithm finds a linear model that is globally optimal with respect to this set. We find that this algorithm is polynomial in N and in the size of the model, but exponential in S. We present extensions of this work that let us scale to reasonably large tuning sets (e.g., one thousand sentences), by either searching only promising regions of the parameter space, or by using a variant of LP-MERT that relies on a beam-search approximation. Experimental results show improvements over the standard Och algorithm.</p><p>5 0.22892325 <a title="40-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Computing_Logical_Form_on_Regulatory_Texts.html">32 emnlp-2011-Computing Logical Form on Regulatory Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikhil Dinesh ; Aravind Joshi ; Insup Lee</p><p>Abstract: The computation of logical form has been proposed as an intermediate step in the translation of sentences to logic. Logical form encodes the resolution of scope ambiguities. In this paper, we describe experiments on a modestsized corpus of regulation annotated with a novel variant of logical form, called abstract syntax trees (ASTs). The main step in computing ASTs is to order scope-taking operators. A learning model for ranking is adapted for this ordering. We design features by studying the problem ofcomparing the scope ofone operator to another. The scope comparisons are used to compute ASTs, with an F-score of 90.6% on the set of ordering decisons.</p><p>6 0.2253871 <a title="40-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_generative_model_for_unsupervised_discovery_of_relations_and_argument_classes_from_clinical_texts.html">14 emnlp-2011-A generative model for unsupervised discovery of relations and argument classes from clinical texts</a></p>

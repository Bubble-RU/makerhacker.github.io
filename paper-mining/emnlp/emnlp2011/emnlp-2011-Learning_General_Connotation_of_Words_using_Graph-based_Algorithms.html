<p>Author: Samuel Brody ; Nicholas Diakopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method which leverages word lengthening to adapt a sentiment lexicon specifically for Twitter and similar social messaging networks. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we call attention to lengthening as a widespread phenomenon in microblogs and social messaging, and demonstrate the importance of handling it correctly. We then show that lengthening is strongly associated with subjectivity and sentiment. Finally, we present an automatic method which leverages this association to detect domain-specific sentiment- and emotionbearing words. We evaluate our method by comparison to human judgments, and analyze its strengths and weaknesses.

<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: We present a general learning-based approach for phrase-level sentiment analysis that adopts an ordinal sentiment scale and is explicitly compositional in nature. Thus, we can model the compositional effects required for accurate assignment of phrase-level sentiment. For example, combining an adverb (e.g., “very”) with a positive polar adjective (e.g., “good”) produces a phrase (“very good”) with increased polarity over the adjective alone. Inspired by recent work on distributional approaches to compositionality, we model each word as a matrix and combine words using iterated matrix multiplication, which allows for the modeling of both additive and multiplicative semantic effects. Although the multiplication-based matrix-space framework has been shown to be a theoretically elegant way to model composition (Rudolph and Giesbrecht, 2010), training such models has to be done carefully: the optimization is nonconvex and requires a good initial starting point. This paper presents the first such algorithm for learning a matrix-space model for semantic composition. In the context of the phrase-level sentiment analysis task, our experimental results show statistically significant improvements in performance over a bagof-words model.</p><p>4 0.12247501 <a title="81-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Predicting_Sentiment_Distributions.html">120 emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoders for Predicting Sentiment Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Jeffrey Pennington ; Eric H. Huang ; Andrew Y. Ng ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning framework based on recursive autoencoders for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label distributions. Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the model’s ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures emotional reactions. Our algorithm can more accurately predict distributions over such labels compared to several competitive baselines.</p><p>5 0.11069722 <a title="81-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Harnessing_WordNet_Senses_for_Supervised_Sentiment_Classification.html">63 emnlp-2011-Harnessing WordNet Senses for Supervised Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Balamurali AR ; Aditya Joshi ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to sentiment classification rely on lexical features, syntax-based features or a combination of the two. We propose semantic features using word senses for a supervised document-level sentiment classifier. To highlight the benefit of sense-based features, we compare word-based representation of documents with a sense-based representation where WordNet senses of the words are used as features. In addition, we highlight the benefit of senses by presenting a part-ofspeech-wise effect on sentiment classification. Finally, we show that even if a WSD engine disambiguates between a limited set of words in a document, a sentiment classifier still performs better than what it does in absence of sense annotation. Since word senses used as features show promise, we also examine the possibility of using similarity metrics defined on WordNet to address the problem of not finding a sense in the training corpus. We per- form experiments using three popular similarity metrics to mitigate the effect of unknown synsets in a test corpus by replacing them with similar synsets from the training corpus. The results show promising improvement with respect to the baseline.</p><p>6 0.10295365 <a title="81-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Literal_and_Metaphorical_Sense_Identification_through_Concrete_and_Abstract_Context.html">91 emnlp-2011-Literal and Metaphorical Sense Identification through Concrete and Abstract Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Turney ; Yair Neuman ; Dan Assaf ; Yohai Cohen</p><p>Abstract: Metaphor is ubiquitous in text, even in highly technical text. Correct inference about textual entailment requires computers to distinguish the literal and metaphorical senses of a word. Past work has treated this problem as a classical word sense disambiguation task. In this paper, we take a new approach, based on research in cognitive linguistics that views metaphor as a method for transferring knowledge from a familiar, well-understood, or concrete domain to an unfamiliar, less understood, or more abstract domain. This view leads to the hypothesis that metaphorical word usage is correlated with the degree of abstractness of the word’s context. We introduce an algorithm that uses this hypothesis to classify a word sense in a given context as either literal (de- notative) or metaphorical (connotative). We evaluate this algorithm with a set of adjectivenoun phrases (e.g., in dark comedy, the adjective dark is used metaphorically; in dark hair, it is used literally) and with the TroFi (Trope Finder) Example Base of literal and nonliteral usage for fifty verbs. We achieve state-of-theart performance on both datasets.</p><p>4 0.50574571 <a title="81-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Learning_of_Selectional_Restrictions_and_Detection_of_Argument_Coercions.html">144 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Learning of Selectional Restrictions and Detection of Argument Coercions</a></p>
<p>Author: Kirk Roberts ; Sanda Harabagiu</p><p>Abstract: Metonymic language is a pervasive phenomenon. Metonymic type shifting, or argument type coercion, results in a selectional restriction violation where the argument’s semantic class differs from the class the predicate expects. In this paper we present an unsupervised method that learns the selectional restriction of arguments and enables the detection of argument coercion. This method also generates an enhanced probabilistic resolution of logical metonymies. The experimental results indicate substantial improvements the detection of coercions and the ranking of metonymic interpretations.</p><p>5 0.43222806 <a title="81-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Compositional_Matrix-Space_Models_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">30 emnlp-2011-Compositional Matrix-Space Models for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for automatic collocation error correction in learner English which is based on paraphrases extracted from parallel corpora. Our key assumption is that collocation errors are often caused by semantic similarity in the first language (L1language) of the writer. An analysis of a large corpus of annotated learner English confirms this assumption. We evaluate our approach on real-world learner data and show that L1-induced paraphrases outperform traditional approaches based on edit distance, homophones, and WordNet synonyms.</p><p>3 0.55382586 <a title="81-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Compositional_Matrix-Space_Models_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">30 emnlp-2011-Compositional Matrix-Space Models for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: We present a general learning-based approach for phrase-level sentiment analysis that adopts an ordinal sentiment scale and is explicitly compositional in nature. Thus, we can model the compositional effects required for accurate assignment of phrase-level sentiment. For example, combining an adverb (e.g., “very”) with a positive polar adjective (e.g., “good”) produces a phrase (“very good”) with increased polarity over the adjective alone. Inspired by recent work on distributional approaches to compositionality, we model each word as a matrix and combine words using iterated matrix multiplication, which allows for the modeling of both additive and multiplicative semantic effects. Although the multiplication-based matrix-space framework has been shown to be a theoretically elegant way to model composition (Rudolph and Giesbrecht, 2010), training such models has to be done carefully: the optimization is nonconvex and requires a good initial starting point. This paper presents the first such algorithm for learning a matrix-space model for semantic composition. In the context of the phrase-level sentiment analysis task, our experimental results show statistically significant improvements in performance over a bagof-words model.</p><p>4 0.53453082 <a title="81-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Harnessing_WordNet_Senses_for_Supervised_Sentiment_Classification.html">63 emnlp-2011-Harnessing WordNet Senses for Supervised Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Balamurali AR ; Aditya Joshi ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to sentiment classification rely on lexical features, syntax-based features or a combination of the two. We propose semantic features using word senses for a supervised document-level sentiment classifier. To highlight the benefit of sense-based features, we compare word-based representation of documents with a sense-based representation where WordNet senses of the words are used as features. In addition, we highlight the benefit of senses by presenting a part-ofspeech-wise effect on sentiment classification. Finally, we show that even if a WSD engine disambiguates between a limited set of words in a document, a sentiment classifier still performs better than what it does in absence of sense annotation. Since word senses used as features show promise, we also examine the possibility of using similarity metrics defined on WordNet to address the problem of not finding a sense in the training corpus. We per- form experiments using three popular similarity metrics to mitigate the effect of unknown synsets in a test corpus by replacing them with similar synsets from the training corpus. The results show promising improvement with respect to the baseline.</p><p>5 0.53128833 <a title="81-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Discourse_Relations_for_Eliminating_Intra-sentence_Polarity_Ambiguities.html">142 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Discovery of Discourse Relations for Eliminating Intra-sentence Polarity Ambiguities</a></p>
<p>Author: Lanjun Zhou ; Binyang Li ; Wei Gao ; Zhongyu Wei ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of opinionated sentences with both positive and negative sentiments1 is a key challenge in sentiment analysis. This paper presents a novel unsupervised method for discovering intra-sentence level discourse relations for eliminating polarity ambiguities. Firstly, a discourse scheme with discourse constraints on polarity was defined empirically based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, a small set of cuephrase-based patterns were utilized to collect a large number of discourse instances which were later converted to semantic sequential representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsupervised method was adopted to generate, weigh and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for recognizing discourse relations. Experimental results showed that the proposed methods not only effectively recognized the defined discourse relations but also achieved significant improvement by integrating discourse information in sentence-level polarity classification.</p><p>6 0.53076363 <a title="81-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Semantic_Topic_Models%3A_Combining_Word_Distributional_Statistics_and_Dictionary_Definitions.html">119 emnlp-2011-Semantic Topic Models: Combining Word Distributional Statistics and Dictionary Definitions</a></p>

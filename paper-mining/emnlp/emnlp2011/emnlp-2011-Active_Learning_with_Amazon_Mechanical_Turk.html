<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: We present a general learning-based approach for phrase-level sentiment analysis that adopts an ordinal sentiment scale and is explicitly compositional in nature. Thus, we can model the compositional effects required for accurate assignment of phrase-level sentiment. For example, combining an adverb (e.g., “very”) with a positive polar adjective (e.g., “good”) produces a phrase (“very good”) with increased polarity over the adjective alone. Inspired by recent work on distributional approaches to compositionality, we model each word as a matrix and combine words using iterated matrix multiplication, which allows for the modeling of both additive and multiplicative semantic effects. Although the multiplication-based matrix-space framework has been shown to be a theoretically elegant way to model composition (Rudolph and Giesbrecht, 2010), training such models has to be done carefully: the optimization is nonconvex and requires a good initial starting point. This paper presents the first such algorithm for learning a matrix-space model for semantic composition. In the context of the phrase-level sentiment analysis task, our experimental results show statistically significant improvements in performance over a bagof-words model.</p><p>5 0.18855879 <a title="17-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Predicting_Sentiment_Distributions.html">120 emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoders for Predicting Sentiment Distributions</a></p>

<p>Author: Keith Vertanen ; Per Ola Kristensson</p><p>Abstract: Augmented and alternative communication (AAC) devices enable users with certain communication disabilities to participate in everyday conversations. Such devices often rely on statistical language models to improve text entry by offering word predictions. These predictions can be improved if the language model is trained on data that closely reflects the style of the users’ intended communications. Unfortunately, there is no large dataset consisting of genuine AAC messages. In this paper we demonstrate how we can crowdsource the creation of a large set of fictional AAC messages. We show that these messages model conversational AAC better than the currently used datasets based on telephone conversations or newswire text. We leverage our crowdsourced messages to intelligently select sentences from much larger sets of Twitter, blog and Usenet data. Compared to a model trained only on telephone transcripts, our best performing model reduced perplexity on three test sets of AAC-like communications by 60– 82% relative. This translated to a potential keystroke savings in a predictive keyboard interface of 5–1 1%.</p><p>4 0.56003821 <a title="17-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Predicting_Sentiment_Distributions.html">120 emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoders for Predicting Sentiment Distributions</a></p>

<p>Author: Andre Martins ; Noah Smith ; Mario Figueiredo ; Pedro Aguiar</p><p>Abstract: Linear models have enjoyed great success in structured prediction in NLP. While a lot of progress has been made on efficient training with several loss functions, the problem of endowing learners with a mechanism for feature selection is still unsolved. Common approaches employ ad hoc filtering or L1regularization; both ignore the structure of the feature space, preventing practicioners from encoding structural prior knowledge. We fill this gap by adopting regularizers that promote structured sparsity, along with efficient algorithms to handle them. Experiments on three tasks (chunking, entity recognition, and dependency parsing) show gains in performance, compactness, and model interpretability.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.6871466 <a title="17-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Active_Learning_with_Amazon_Mechanical_Turk.html">17 emnlp-2011-Active Learning with Amazon Mechanical Turk</a></p>

<p>Author: Ni Lao ; Tom Mitchell ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: t om . We consider the problem of performing learning and inference in a large scale knowledge base containing imperfect knowledge with incomplete coverage. We show that a soft inference procedure based on a combination of constrained, weighted, random walks through the knowledge base graph can be used to reliably infer new beliefs for the knowledge base. More specifically, we show that the system can learn to infer different target relations by tuning the weights associated with random walks that follow different paths through the graph, using a version of the Path Ranking Algorithm (Lao and Cohen, 2010b). We apply this approach to a knowledge base of approximately 500,000 beliefs extracted imperfectly from the web by NELL, a never-ending language learner (Carlson et al., 2010). This new system improves significantly over NELL’s earlier Horn-clause learning and inference method: it obtains nearly double the precision at rank 100, and the new learning method is also applicable to many more inference tasks.</p><p>4 0.54985058 <a title="17-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Discriminating_Gender_on_Twitter.html">41 emnlp-2011-Discriminating Gender on Twitter</a></p>
<p>Author: John D. Burger ; John Henderson ; George Kim ; Guido Zarrella</p><p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of demographic attributes from social media and other informal online content is valuable for marketing, personalization, and legal investigation. This paper describes the construction of a large, multilingual dataset labeled with gender, and investigates statistical models for determining the gender of uncharacterized Twitter users. We explore several different classifier types on this dataset. We show the degree to which classifier accuracy varies based on tweet volumes as well as when various kinds of profile metadata are included in the models. We also perform a large-scale human assessment using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our methods significantly out-perform both baseline models and almost all humans on the same task.</p><p>5 0.54541081 <a title="17-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Collaborative_Ranking%3A_A_Case_Study_on_Entity_Linking.html">29 emnlp-2011-Collaborative Ranking: A Case Study on Entity Linking</a></p>
<p>Author: Zheng Chen ; Heng Ji</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new ranking scheme, collaborative ranking (CR). In contrast to traditional non-collaborative ranking scheme which solely relies on the strengths of isolated queries and one stand-alone ranking algorithm, the new scheme integrates the strengths from multiple collaborators of a query and the strengths from multiple ranking algorithms. We elaborate three specific forms of collaborative ranking, namely, micro collaborative ranking (MiCR), macro collaborative ranking (MaCR) and micro-macro collab- orative ranking (MiMaCR). Experiments on entity linking task show that our proposed scheme is indeed effective and promising.</p><p>6 0.54294002 <a title="17-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Rumor_has_it%3A_Identifying_Misinformation_in_Microblogs.html">117 emnlp-2011-Rumor has it: Identifying Misinformation in Microblogs</a></p>

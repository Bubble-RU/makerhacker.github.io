<p>Author: Yoav Artzi ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Conversations provide rich opportunities for interactive, continuous learning. When something goes wrong, a system can ask for clarification, rewording, or otherwise redirect the interaction to achieve its goals. In this paper, we present an approach for using conversational interactions of this type to induce semantic parsers. We demonstrate learning without any explicit annotation of the meanings of user utterances. Instead, we model meaning with latent variables, and introduce a loss function to measure how well potential meanings match the conversation. This loss drives the overall learning approach, which induces a weighted CCG grammar that could be used to automatically bootstrap the semantic analysis component in a complete dialog system. Experiments on DARPA Communicator conversational logs demonstrate effective learning, despite requiring no explicit mean- . ing annotations.</p><p>3 0.13991551 <a title="38-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Discriminating_Gender_on_Twitter.html">41 emnlp-2011-Discriminating Gender on Twitter</a></p>
<p>Author: John D. Burger ; John Henderson ; George Kim ; Guido Zarrella</p><p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of demographic attributes from social media and other informal online content is valuable for marketing, personalization, and legal investigation. This paper describes the construction of a large, multilingual dataset labeled with gender, and investigates statistical models for determining the gender of uncharacterized Twitter users. We explore several different classifier types on this dataset. We show the degree to which classifier accuracy varies based on tweet volumes as well as when various kinds of profile metadata are included in the models. We also perform a large-scale human assessment using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our methods significantly out-perform both baseline models and almost all humans on the same task.</p><p>4 0.12996545 <a title="38-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Predicting_Thread_Discourse_Structure_over_Technical_Web_Forums.html">105 emnlp-2011-Predicting Thread Discourse Structure over Technical Web Forums</a></p>
<p>Author: Li Wang ; Marco Lui ; Su Nam Kim ; Joakim Nivre ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: Online discussion forums are a valuable means for users to resolve specific information needs, both interactively for the participants and statically for users who search/browse over historical thread data. However, the complex structure of forum threads can make it difficult for users to extract relevant information. The discourse structure of web forum threads, in the form of labelled dependency relationships between posts, has the potential to greatly improve information access over web forum archives. In this paper, we present the task of parsing user forum threads to determine the labelled dependencies between posts. Three methods, including a dependency parsing approach, are proposed to jointly classify the links (relationships) between posts and the dialogue act (type) of each link. The proposed methods significantly surpass an informed baseline. We also experiment with “in situ” classification of evolving threads, and establish that our best methods are able to perform equivalently well over partial threads as complete threads.</p><p>5 0.11968543 <a title="38-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Correction_Model_for_Word_Alignments.html">3 emnlp-2011-A Correction Model for Word Alignments</a></p>
<p>Author: J. Scott McCarley ; Abraham Ittycheriah ; Salim Roukos ; Bing Xiang ; Jian-ming Xu</p><p>Abstract: Models of word alignment built as sequences of links have limited expressive power, but are easy to decode. Word aligners that model the alignment matrix can express arbitrary alignments, but are difficult to decode. We propose an alignment matrix model as a correction algorithm to an underlying sequencebased aligner. Then a greedy decoding algorithm enables the full expressive power of the alignment matrix formulation. Improved alignment performance is shown for all nine language pairs tested. The improved alignments also improved translation quality from Chinese to English and English to Italian.</p><p>6 0.11298931 <a title="38-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Tweets%3A_An_Experimental_Study.html">98 emnlp-2011-Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study</a></p>

<p>Author: Keith Vertanen ; Per Ola Kristensson</p><p>Abstract: Augmented and alternative communication (AAC) devices enable users with certain communication disabilities to participate in everyday conversations. Such devices often rely on statistical language models to improve text entry by offering word predictions. These predictions can be improved if the language model is trained on data that closely reflects the style of the users’ intended communications. Unfortunately, there is no large dataset consisting of genuine AAC messages. In this paper we demonstrate how we can crowdsource the creation of a large set of fictional AAC messages. We show that these messages model conversational AAC better than the currently used datasets based on telephone conversations or newswire text. We leverage our crowdsourced messages to intelligently select sentences from much larger sets of Twitter, blog and Usenet data. Compared to a model trained only on telephone transcripts, our best performing model reduced perplexity on three test sets of AAC-like communications by 60– 82% relative. This translated to a potential keystroke savings in a predictive keyboard interface of 5–1 1%.</p><p>4 0.4444972 <a title="38-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Predicting_Thread_Discourse_Structure_over_Technical_Web_Forums.html">105 emnlp-2011-Predicting Thread Discourse Structure over Technical Web Forums</a></p>

Our goal is to create sentence classifiers that can identify whether a sentence contains a speech act, and can recognize sentences containing four different speech act classes: Commissives, Directives, Expressives, and Representatives. We conduct experiments using a wide variety of features, including lexical and syntactic features, speech act word lists from external resources, and domain-specific semantic class features. We evaluate our results on a collection of message board posts in the domain of veterinary medicine.</p><p>6 0.40825632 <a title="38-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Generating_Subsequent_Reference_in_Shared_Visual_Scenes%3A_Computation_vs_Re-Use.html">62 emnlp-2011-Generating Subsequent Reference in Shared Visual Scenes: Computation vs Re-Use</a></p>

<p>Author: Bryan Rink ; Sanda Harabagiu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a generative model for the automatic discovery of relations between entities in electronic medical records. The model discovers relation instances and their types by determining which context tokens express the relation. Additionally, the valid semantic classes for each type of relation are determined. We show that the model produces clusters of relation trigger words which better correspond with manually annotated relations than several existing clustering techniques. The discovered relations reveal some of the implicit semantic structure present in patient records.</p><p>3 0.68960834 <a title="38-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Random_Walk_Inference_and_Learning_in_A_Large_Scale_Knowledge_Base.html">109 emnlp-2011-Random Walk Inference and Learning in A Large Scale Knowledge Base</a></p>
<p>Author: Ni Lao ; Tom Mitchell ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: t om . We consider the problem of performing learning and inference in a large scale knowledge base containing imperfect knowledge with incomplete coverage. We show that a soft inference procedure based on a combination of constrained, weighted, random walks through the knowledge base graph can be used to reliably infer new beliefs for the knowledge base. More specifically, we show that the system can learn to infer different target relations by tuning the weights associated with random walks that follow different paths through the graph, using a version of the Path Ranking Algorithm (Lao and Cohen, 2010b). We apply this approach to a knowledge base of approximately 500,000 beliefs extracted imperfectly from the web by NELL, a never-ending language learner (Carlson et al., 2010). This new system improves significantly over NELL’s earlier Horn-clause learning and inference method: it obtains nearly double the precision at rank 100, and the new learning method is also applicable to many more inference tasks.</p><p>4 0.68023723 <a title="38-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Discourse_Relations_for_Eliminating_Intra-sentence_Polarity_Ambiguities.html">142 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Discovery of Discourse Relations for Eliminating Intra-sentence Polarity Ambiguities</a></p>
<p>Author: Lanjun Zhou ; Binyang Li ; Wei Gao ; Zhongyu Wei ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of opinionated sentences with both positive and negative sentiments1 is a key challenge in sentiment analysis. This paper presents a novel unsupervised method for discovering intra-sentence level discourse relations for eliminating polarity ambiguities. Firstly, a discourse scheme with discourse constraints on polarity was defined empirically based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, a small set of cuephrase-based patterns were utilized to collect a large number of discourse instances which were later converted to semantic sequential representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsupervised method was adopted to generate, weigh and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for recognizing discourse relations. Experimental results showed that the proposed methods not only effectively recognized the defined discourse relations but also achieved significant improvement by integrating discourse information in sentence-level polarity classification.</p><p>5 0.67677063 <a title="38-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Linking_Entities_to_a_Knowledge_Base_with_Query_Expansion.html">90 emnlp-2011-Linking Entities to a Knowledge Base with Query Expansion</a></p>
<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to entity linking based on a statistical language model-based information retrieval with query expansion. We use both local contexts and global world knowledge to expand query language models. We place a strong emphasis on named entities in the local contexts and explore a positional language model to weigh them differently based on their distances to the query. Our experiments on the TAC-KBP 2010 data show that incorporating such contextual information indeed aids in disambiguating the named entities and consistently improves the entity linking performance. Compared with the official results from KBP 2010 participants, our system shows competitive performance.</p><p>6 0.67509228 <a title="38-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Collaborative_Ranking%3A_A_Case_Study_on_Entity_Linking.html">29 emnlp-2011-Collaborative Ranking: A Case Study on Entity Linking</a></p>

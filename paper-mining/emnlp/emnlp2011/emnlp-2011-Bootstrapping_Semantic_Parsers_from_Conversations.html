We find that mapping conversational stimuli onto responses is more difficult than translating between languages, due to the wider range of possible responses, the larger fraction of unaligned words/phrases, and the presence of large phrase pairs whose alignment cannot be further decomposed. After addressing these challenges, we compare approaches based on SMT and Information Retrieval in a human evaluation. We show that SMT outperforms IR on this task, and its output is preferred over actual human responses in 15% of cases.

<p>Author: Ashequl Qadir ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: This research studies the text genre of message board forums, which contain a mixture of expository sentences that present factual information and conversational sentences that include communicative acts between the writer and readers. Our goal is to create sentence classifiers that can identify whether a sentence contains a speech act, and can recognize sentences containing four different speech act classes: Commissives, Directives, Expressives, and Representatives. We conduct experiments using a wide variety of features, including lexical and syntactic features, speech act word lists from external resources, and domain-specific semantic class features. We evaluate our results on a collection of message board posts in the domain of veterinary medicine.</p><p>5 0.11551987 <a title="24-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Probabilistic_Forest-to-String_Model_for_Language_Generation_from_Typed_Lambda_Calculus_Expressions.html">10 emnlp-2011-A Probabilistic Forest-to-String Model for Language Generation from Typed Lambda Calculus Expressions</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Lu ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a novel probabilistic approach for generating natural language sentences from their underlying semantics in the form of typed lambda calculus. The approach is built on top of a novel reduction-based weighted synchronous context free grammar formalism, which facilitates the transformation process from typed lambda calculus into natural language sentences. Sentences can then be generated based on such grammar rules with a log-linear model. To acquire such grammar rules automatically in an unsupervised manner, we also propose a novel approach with a generative model, which maps from sub-expressions of logical forms to word sequences in natural language sentences. Experiments on benchmark datasets for both English and Chinese generation tasks yield significant improvements over results obtained by two state-of-the-art machine translation models, in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluation.</p><p>6 0.10692544 <a title="24-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_dependency_parsers_by_jointly_optimizing_multiple_objectives.html">137 emnlp-2011-Training dependency parsers by jointly optimizing multiple objectives</a></p>

<p>Author: Li Wang ; Marco Lui ; Su Nam Kim ; Joakim Nivre ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: Online discussion forums are a valuable means for users to resolve specific information needs, both interactively for the participants and statically for users who search/browse over historical thread data. However, the complex structure of forum threads can make it difficult for users to extract relevant information. The discourse structure of web forum threads, in the form of labelled dependency relationships between posts, has the potential to greatly improve information access over web forum archives. In this paper, we present the task of parsing user forum threads to determine the labelled dependencies between posts. Three methods, including a dependency parsing approach, are proposed to jointly classify the links (relationships) between posts and the dialogue act (type) of each link. The proposed methods significantly surpass an informed baseline. We also experiment with “in situ” classification of evolving threads, and establish that our best methods are able to perform equivalently well over partial threads as complete threads.</p><p>6 0.33206284 <a title="24-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Reducing_Grounded_Learning_Tasks_To_Grammatical_Inference.html">111 emnlp-2011-Reducing Grounded Learning Tasks To Grammatical Inference</a></p>

<p>Author: Johannes Hoffart ; Mohamed Amir Yosef ; Ilaria Bordino ; Hagen Furstenau ; Manfred Pinkal ; Marc Spaniol ; Bilyana Taneva ; Stefan Thater ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: Disambiguating named entities in naturallanguage text maps mentions of ambiguous names onto canonical entities like people or places, registered in a knowledge base such as DBpedia or YAGO. This paper presents a robust method for collective disambiguation, by harnessing context from knowledge bases and using a new form of coherence graph. It unifies prior approaches into a comprehensive framework that combines three measures: the prior probability of an entity being mentioned, the similarity between the contexts of a mention and a candidate entity, as well as the coherence among candidate entities for all mentions together. The method builds a weighted graph of mentions and candidate entities, and computes a dense subgraph that approximates the best joint mention-entity mapping. Experiments show that the new method significantly outperforms prior methods in terms of accuracy, with robust behavior across a variety of inputs.</p><p>3 0.59249175 <a title="24-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Learning_to_Simplify_Sentences_with_Quasi-Synchronous_Grammar_and_Integer_Programming.html">85 emnlp-2011-Learning to Simplify Sentences with Quasi-Synchronous Grammar and Integer Programming</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristian Woodsend ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: Text simplification aims to rewrite text into simpler versions, and thus make information accessible to a broader audience. Most previous work simplifies sentences using handcrafted rules aimed at splitting long sentences, or substitutes difficult words using a predefined dictionary. This paper presents a datadriven model based on quasi-synchronous grammar, a formalism that can naturally capture structural mismatches and complex rewrite operations. We describe how such a grammar can be induced from Wikipedia and propose an integer linear programming model for selecting the most appropriate simplification from the space of possible rewrites generated by the grammar. We show experimentally that our method creates simplifications that significantly reduce the reading difficulty ofthe input, while maintaining grammaticality and preserving its meaning.</p><p>4 0.37555334 <a title="24-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Tuning_as_Ranking.html">138 emnlp-2011-Tuning as Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Hopkins ; Jonathan May</p><p>Abstract: We offer a simple, effective, and scalable method for statistical machine translation parameter tuning based on the pairwise approach to ranking (Herbrich et al., 1999). Unlike the popular MERT algorithm (Och, 2003), our pairwise ranking optimization (PRO) method is not limited to a handful of parameters and can easily handle systems with thousands of features. Moreover, unlike recent approaches built upon the MIRA algorithm of Crammer and Singer (2003) (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008b), PRO is easy to implement. It uses off-the-shelf linear binary classifier software and can be built on top of an existing MERT framework in a matter of hours. We establish PRO’s scalability and effectiveness by comparing it to MERT and MIRA and demonstrate parity on both phrase-based and syntax-based systems in a variety of language pairs, using large scale data scenarios.</p><p>5 0.3628906 <a title="24-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Corroborating_Text_Evaluation_Results_with_Heterogeneous_Measures.html">36 emnlp-2011-Corroborating Text Evaluation Results with Heterogeneous Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Enrique Amigo ; Julio Gonzalo ; Jesus Gimenez ; Felisa Verdejo</p><p>Abstract: Automatically produced texts (e.g. translations or summaries) are usually evaluated with n-gram based measures such as BLEU or ROUGE, while the wide set of more sophisticated measures that have been proposed in the last years remains largely ignored for practical purposes. In this paper we first present an indepth analysis of the state of the art in order to clarify this issue. After this, we formalize and verify empirically a set of properties that every text evaluation measure based on similarity to human-produced references satisfies. These properties imply that corroborating system improvements with additional measures always increases the overall reliability of the evaluation process. In addition, the greater the heterogeneity of the measures (which is measurable) the higher their combined reliability. These results support the use of heterogeneous measures in order to consolidate text evaluation results.</p><p>6 0.3603017 <a title="24-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Generate_and_Rank_Approach_to_Sentence_Paraphrasing.html">6 emnlp-2011-A Generate and Rank Approach to Sentence Paraphrasing</a></p>

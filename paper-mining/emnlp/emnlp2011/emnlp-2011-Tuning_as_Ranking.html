<p>Author: Michel Galley ; Chris Quirk</p><p>Abstract: Minimum error rate training is a crucial component to many state-of-the-art NLP applications, such as machine translation and speech recognition. However, common evaluation functions such as BLEU or word error rate are generally highly non-convex and thus prone to search errors. In this paper, we present LP-MERT, an exact search algorithm for minimum error rate training that reaches the global optimum using a series of reductions to linear programming. Given a set of N-best lists produced from S input sentences, this algorithm finds a linear model that is globally optimal with respect to this set. We find that this algorithm is polynomial in N and in the size of the model, but exponential in S. We present extensions of this work that let us scale to reasonably large tuning sets (e.g., one thousand sentences), by either searching only promising regions of the parameter space, or by using a variant of LP-MERT that relies on a beam-search approximation. Experimental results show improvements over the standard Och algorithm.</p><p>3 0.17618433 <a title="138-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Probabilistic_Forest-to-String_Model_for_Language_Generation_from_Typed_Lambda_Calculus_Expressions.html">10 emnlp-2011-A Probabilistic Forest-to-String Model for Language Generation from Typed Lambda Calculus Expressions</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Lu ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a novel probabilistic approach for generating natural language sentences from their underlying semantics in the form of typed lambda calculus. The approach is built on top of a novel reduction-based weighted synchronous context free grammar formalism, which facilitates the transformation process from typed lambda calculus into natural language sentences. Sentences can then be generated based on such grammar rules with a log-linear model. To acquire such grammar rules automatically in an unsupervised manner, we also propose a novel approach with a generative model, which maps from sub-expressions of logical forms to word sequences in natural language sentences. Experiments on benchmark datasets for both English and Chinese generation tasks yield significant improvements over results obtained by two state-of-the-art machine translation models, in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluation.</p><p>4 0.11693097 <a title="138-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Better_Evaluation_Metrics_Lead_to_Better_Machine_Translation.html">22 emnlp-2011-Better Evaluation Metrics Lead to Better Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Chang Liu ; Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Many machine translation evaluation metrics have been proposed after the seminal BLEU metric, and many among them have been found to consistently outperform BLEU, demonstrated by their better correlations with human judgment. It has long been the hope that by tuning machine translation systems against these new generation metrics, advances in automatic machine translation evaluation can lead directly to advances in automatic machine translation. However, to date there has been no unambiguous report that these new metrics can improve a state-of-theart machine translation system over its BLEUtuned baseline. In this paper, we demonstrate that tuning Joshua, a hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system, with the TESLA metrics results in significantly better humanjudged translation quality than the BLEUtuned baseline. TESLA-M in particular is simple and performs well in practice on large datasets. We release all our implementation under an open source license. It is our hope that this work will encourage the machine translation community to finally move away from BLEU as the unquestioned default and to consider the new generation metrics when tuning their systems.</p><p>5 0.11469758 <a title="138-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous_Phrase_Dependency_Grammars_for_Machine_Translation.html">108 emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous Phrase Dependency Grammars for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Gimpel ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We present a quasi-synchronous dependency grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006) for machine translation in which the leaves of the tree are phrases rather than words as in previous work (Gimpel and Smith, 2009). This formulation allows us to combine structural components of phrase-based and syntax-based MT in a single model. We describe a method of extracting phrase dependencies from parallel text using a target-side dependency parser. For decoding, we describe a coarse-to-fine approach based on lattice dependency parsing of phrase lattices. We demonstrate performance improvements for Chinese-English and UrduEnglish translation over a phrase-based baseline. We also investigate the use of unsupervised dependency parsers, reporting encouraging preliminary results.</p><p>6 0.10379774 <a title="138-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Fast_Generation_of_Translation_Forest_for_Large-Scale_SMT_Discriminative_Training.html">58 emnlp-2011-Fast Generation of Translation Forest for Large-Scale SMT Discriminative Training</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhifei Li ; Ziyuan Wang ; Jason Eisner ; Sanjeev Khudanpur ; Brian Roark</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative training for machine translation has been well studied in the recent past. A limitation of the work to date is that it relies on the availability of high-quality in-domain bilingual text for supervised training. We present an unsupervised discriminative training framework to incorporate the usually plentiful target-language monolingual data by using a rough “reverse” translation system. Intuitively, our method strives to ensure that probabilistic “round-trip” translation from a target- language sentence to the source-language and back will have low expected loss. Theoretically, this may be justified as (discriminatively) minimizing an imputed empirical risk. Empirically, we demonstrate that augmenting supervised training with unsupervised data improves translation performance over the supervised case for both IWSLT and NIST tasks.</p><p>4 0.408012 <a title="138-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Probabilistic_Forest-to-String_Model_for_Language_Generation_from_Typed_Lambda_Calculus_Expressions.html">10 emnlp-2011-A Probabilistic Forest-to-String Model for Language Generation from Typed Lambda Calculus Expressions</a></p>

Exiting methods exploit semantic evidence from a single knowledge source, and are predominantly evaluated only in the general domain. This paper introduces a method of harnessing different knowledge sources under a uniform model for measuring semantic relatedness between words or concepts. Using Wikipedia and WordNet as examples, and evaluated in both the general and biomedical domains, it successfully combines strengths from both knowledge sources and outperforms stateof-the-art on many datasets.</p><p>3 0.66503006 <a title="138-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Data-Driven_Response_Generation_in_Social_Media.html">38 emnlp-2011-Data-Driven Response Generation in Social Media</a></p>

We find that mapping conversational stimuli onto responses is more difficult than translating between languages, due to the wider range of possible responses, the larger fraction of unaligned words/phrases, and the presence of large phrase pairs whose alignment cannot be further decomposed. After addressing these challenges, we compare approaches based on SMT and Information Retrieval in a human evaluation. We show that SMT outperforms IR on this task, and its output is preferred over actual human responses in 15% of cases. As far as we are aware, this is the first work to investigate the use of phrase-based SMT to directly translate a linguistic stimulus into an appropriate response.</p><p>4 0.66327649 <a title="138-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Corroborating_Text_Evaluation_Results_with_Heterogeneous_Measures.html">36 emnlp-2011-Corroborating Text Evaluation Results with Heterogeneous Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Enrique Amigo ; Julio Gonzalo ; Jesus Gimenez ; Felisa Verdejo</p><p>Abstract: Automatically produced texts (e.g. translations or summaries) are usually evaluated with n-gram based measures such as BLEU or ROUGE, while the wide set of more sophisticated measures that have been proposed in the last years remains largely ignored for practical purposes. In this paper we first present an indepth analysis of the state of the art in order to clarify this issue. After this, we formalize and verify empirically a set of properties that every text evaluation measure based on similarity to human-produced references satisfies. These properties imply that corroborating system improvements with additional measures always increases the overall reliability of the evaluation process. In addition, the greater the heterogeneity of the measures (which is measurable) the higher their combined reliability. These results support the use of heterogeneous measures in order to consolidate text evaluation results.</p><p>5 0.65877742 <a title="138-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Random_Walk_Inference_and_Learning_in_A_Large_Scale_Knowledge_Base.html">109 emnlp-2011-Random Walk Inference and Learning in A Large Scale Knowledge Base</a></p>
<p>Author: Ni Lao ; Tom Mitchell ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: t om . We consider the problem of performing learning and inference in a large scale knowledge base containing imperfect knowledge with incomplete coverage. We show that a soft inference procedure based on a combination of constrained, weighted, random walks through the knowledge base graph can be used to reliably infer new beliefs for the knowledge base. More specifically, we show that the system can learn to infer different target relations by tuning the weights associated with random walks that follow different paths through the graph, using a version of the Path Ranking Algorithm (Lao and Cohen, 2010b). We apply this approach to a knowledge base of approximately 500,000 beliefs extracted imperfectly from the web by NELL, a never-ending language learner (Carlson et al., 2010). This new system improves significantly over NELL’s earlier Horn-clause learning and inference method: it obtains nearly double the precision at rank 100, and the new learning method is also applicable to many more inference tasks.</p><p>6 0.6586585 <a title="138-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Better_Evaluation_Metrics_Lead_to_Better_Machine_Translation.html">22 emnlp-2011-Better Evaluation Metrics Lead to Better Machine Translation</a></p>

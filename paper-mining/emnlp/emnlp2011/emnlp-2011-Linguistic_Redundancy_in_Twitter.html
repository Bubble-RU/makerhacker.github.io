<p>Author: John D.

This paper describes the construction of a large, multilingual dataset labeled with gender, and investigates statistical models for determining the gender of uncharacterized Twitter users. We explore several different classifier types on this dataset. We show the degree to which classifier accuracy varies based on tweet volumes as well as when various kinds of profile metadata are included in the models. We also perform a large-scale human assessment using Amazon Mechanical Turk.

<p>Author: Roy Bar-Haim ; Elad Dinur ; Ronen Feldman ; Moshe Fresko ; Guy Goldstein</p><p>Abstract: Information published in online stock investment message boards, and more recently in stock microblogs, is considered highly valuable by many investors. Previous work focused on aggregation of sentiment from all users. However, in this work we show that it is beneficial to distinguish expert users from non-experts. We propose a general framework for identifying expert investors, and use it as a basis for several models that predict stock rise from stock microblogging messages (stock tweets). In particular, we present two methods that combine expert identification and per-user unsupervised learning. These methods were shown to achieve relatively high precision in predicting stock rise, and significantly outperform our baseline. In addition, our work provides an in-depth analysis of the content and potential usefulness of stock tweets.</p><p>4 0.41878304 <a title="89-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Tweets%3A_An_Experimental_Study.html">98 emnlp-2011-Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Sam Clark ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: People tweet more than 100 Million times daily, yielding a noisy, informal, but sometimes informative corpus of 140-character messages that mirrors the zeitgeist in an unprecedented manner. The performance of standard NLP tools is severely degraded on tweets. This paper addresses this issue by re-building the NLP pipeline beginning with part-of-speech tagging, through chunking, to named-entity recognition. Our novel T-NER system doubles F1 score compared with the Stanford NER system. T-NER leverages the redundancy inherent in tweets to achieve this performance, using LabeledLDA to exploit Freebase dictionaries as a source of distant supervision. LabeledLDA outperforms cotraining, increasing F1 by 25% over ten common entity types.

<p>Author: Vahed Qazvinian ; Emily Rosengren ; Dragomir R. Radev ; Qiaozhu Mei</p><p>Abstract: A rumor is commonly defined as a statement whose true value is unverifiable. Rumors may spread misinformation (false information) or disinformation (deliberately false information) on a network of people. Identifying rumors is crucial in online social media where large amounts of information are easily spread across a large network by sources with unverified authority. In this paper, we address the problem of rumor detection in microblogs and explore the effectiveness of 3 categories of features: content-based, network-based, and microblog-specific memes for correctly identifying rumors. Moreover, we show how these features are also effective in identifying disinformers, users who endorse a rumor and further help it to spread. We perform our experiments on more than 10,000 manually annotated tweets collected from Twitter and show how our retrieval model achieves more than 0.95 in Mean Average Precision (MAP). Fi- nally, we believe that our dataset is the first large-scale dataset on rumor detection. It can open new dimensions in analyzing online misinformation and other aspects of microblog conversations.</p><p>6 0.21121965 <a title="89-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Twitter_Catches_The_Flu%3A_Detecting_Influenza_Epidemics_using_Twitter.html">139 emnlp-2011-Twitter Catches The Flu: Detecting Influenza Epidemics using Twitter</a></p>

<p>Author: Eiji ARAMAKI ; Sachiko MASKAWA ; Mizuki MORITA</p><p>Abstract: Sachiko MASKAWA The University of Tokyo Tokyo, Japan s achi ko . mas kawa @ gma i . com l Mizuki MORITA National Institute of Biomedical Innovation Osaka, Japan mori ta . mi zuki @ gmai l com . posts more than 5.5 million messages (tweets) every day (reported by Twitter.com in March 201 1). With the recent rise in popularity and scale of social media, a growing need exists for systems that can extract useful information from huge amounts of data. We address the issue of detecting influenza epidemics. First, the proposed system extracts influenza related tweets using Twitter API. Then, only tweets that mention actual influenza patients are extracted by the support vector machine (SVM) based classifier. The experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach (0.89 correlation to the gold standard). Especially at the outbreak and early spread (early epidemic stage), the proposed method shows high correlation (0.97 correlation), which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. This paper describes that Twitter texts reflect the real world, and that NLP techniques can be applied to extract only tweets that contain useful information. 1</p><p>6 0.56796134 <a title="89-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Tweets%3A_An_Experimental_Study.html">98 emnlp-2011-Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study</a></p>

<p>Author: Juri Ganitkevitch ; Chris Callison-Burch ; Courtney Napoles ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: Previous work has shown that high quality phrasal paraphrases can be extracted from bilingual parallel corpora. However, it is not clear whether bitexts are an appropriate resource for extracting more sophisticated sentential paraphrases, which are more obviously learnable from monolingual parallel corpora. We extend bilingual paraphrase extraction to syntactic paraphrases and demonstrate its ability to learn a variety of general paraphrastic transformations, including passivization, dative shift, and topicalization. We discuss how our model can be adapted to many text generation tasks by augmenting its feature set, development data, and parameter estimation routine. We illustrate this adaptation by using our paraphrase model for the task of sentence compression and achieve results competitive with state-of-the-art compression systems.</p><p>3 0.49807715 <a title="89-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Learning_of_Selectional_Restrictions_and_Detection_of_Argument_Coercions.html">144 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Learning of Selectional Restrictions and Detection of Argument Coercions</a></p>
<p>Author: Kirk Roberts ; Sanda Harabagiu</p><p>Abstract: Metonymic language is a pervasive phenomenon. Metonymic type shifting, or argument type coercion, results in a selectional restriction violation where the argument’s semantic class differs from the class the predicate expects. In this paper we present an unsupervised method that learns the selectional restriction of arguments and enables the detection of argument coercion. This method also generates an enhanced probabilistic resolution of logical metonymies. The experimental results indicate substantial improvements the detection of coercions and the ranking of metonymic interpretations.</p><p>4 0.40758374 <a title="89-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Random_Walk_Inference_and_Learning_in_A_Large_Scale_Knowledge_Base.html">109 emnlp-2011-Random Walk Inference and Learning in A Large Scale Knowledge Base</a></p>
<p>Author: Ni Lao ; Tom Mitchell ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: t om . We consider the problem of performing learning and inference in a large scale knowledge base containing imperfect knowledge with incomplete coverage. We show that a soft inference procedure based on a combination of constrained, weighted, random walks through the knowledge base graph can be used to reliably infer new beliefs for the knowledge base. More specifically, we show that the system can learn to infer different target relations by tuning the weights associated with random walks that follow different paths through the graph, using a version of the Path Ranking Algorithm (Lao and Cohen, 2010b). We apply this approach to a knowledge base of approximately 500,000 beliefs extracted imperfectly from the web by NELL, a never-ending language learner (Carlson et al., 2010). This new system improves significantly over NELL’s earlier Horn-clause learning and inference method: it obtains nearly double the precision at rank 100, and the new learning method is also applicable to many more inference tasks.</p><p>5 0.38784212 <a title="89-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Discriminating_Gender_on_Twitter.html">41 emnlp-2011-Discriminating Gender on Twitter</a></p>
<p>Author: John D. Burger ; John Henderson ; George Kim ; Guido Zarrella</p><p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of demographic attributes from social media and other informal online content is valuable for marketing, personalization, and legal investigation. This paper describes the construction of a large, multilingual dataset labeled with gender, and investigates statistical models for determining the gender of uncharacterized Twitter users. We explore several different classifier types on this dataset. We show the degree to which classifier accuracy varies based on tweet volumes as well as when various kinds of profile metadata are included in the models. We also perform a large-scale human assessment using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our methods significantly out-perform both baseline models and almost all humans on the same task.</p><p>6 0.38383174 <a title="89-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Linking_Entities_to_a_Knowledge_Base_with_Query_Expansion.html">90 emnlp-2011-Linking Entities to a Knowledge Base with Query Expansion</a></p>

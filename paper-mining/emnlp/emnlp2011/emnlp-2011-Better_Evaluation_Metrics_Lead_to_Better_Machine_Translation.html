</p><p>6 1 Introduction The dominant framework of machine translation (MT) today is statistical machine translation (SMT) (Hutchins, 2007). [sent-11, score-0.398]
</p><p>7 In SMT, the parameter space is explored by a tuning algorithm, typically MERT (Minimum Error Rate Training) (Och, 2003), though the exact method is not important for our purpose. [sent-14, score-0.182]
</p><p>8 The tuning algorithm carries out repeated experiments with different decoder parameter values over a development data set, for which reference  translations are given. [sent-15, score-0.391]
</p><p>9 An automatic MT evaluation metric compares the output of the decoder against the reference(s), and guides the tuning algorithm towards iteratively better decoder parameters and output translations. [sent-16, score-0.475]
</p><p>10 The quality of the automatic MT evaluation metric therefore has an immediate effect on the whole system. [sent-17, score-0.201]
</p><p>11 The first automatic MT evaluation metric to show a high correlation with human judgment is BLEU (Papineni et al. [sent-18, score-0.398]
</p><p>12 Together with its close variant the NIST metric, they have quickly become the standard way of tuning statistical machine translation systems. [sent-20, score-0.381]
</p><p>13 While BLEU is an impressively simple and effective metric, recent evaluations have shown that many new generation metrics can outperform BLEU in terms of correlation with human judgment (Callison-Burch et al. [sent-21, score-0.434]
</p><p>14 Some of these new metrics include METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Lavie and Agarwal, 2007), TER (Snover et al. [sent-24, score-0.134]
</p><p>15 Given the close relationship between automatic MT and automatic MT evaluation, the logical expec-  tation is that a better MT evaluation metric would Proce Ed iningbsu orfg th ,e S 2c0o1tl1an Cdo,n UfeKr,en Jcuely on 27 E–m31p,ir 2ic0a1l1 M. [sent-27, score-0.244]
</p><p>16 In the SMT community, MT tuning still uses BLEU almost exclusively. [sent-31, score-0.182]
</p><p>17 Some researchers have investigated the use of better metrics for MT tuning, with mixed results. [sent-32, score-0.134]
</p><p>18 (2009) reported improved human judgment using their entailment-based metric. [sent-34, score-0.127]
</p><p>19 However, the metric is heavy weight and slow in practice, with an estimated runtime of 40 days on the NIST MT 2002/2006/2008 dataset, and the authors had to resort to a two-phase MERT process with a reduced n-best list. [sent-35, score-0.189]
</p><p>20 (2010) compared tuning a phrase-based SMT system with BLEU, NIST, METEOR, and TER, and concluded that BLEU and NIST are still the best choices for MT tuning, despite the proven higher correlation of METEOR and TER with human judgment. [sent-38, score-0.291]
</p><p>21 Our empirical study is carried out in the context of WMT 2010, for the French-English, Spanish-English, and German-English machine translation tasks. [sent-41, score-0.199]
</p><p>22 We show that Joshua responds well to the change of evaluation metric, in that a system trained on metric M typically does well when judged by the same metric M. [sent-42, score-0.354]
</p><p>23 We further evaluate the different systems with manual judgments and show that the TESLA family of metrics (both TESLA-M and TESLA-F) significantly outperforms BLEU when used to guide the MERT search. [sent-43, score-0.208]
</p><p>24 In Section 2, we describe the four evaluation metrics used. [sent-45, score-0.134]
</p><p>25 Section 3 outlines our experimental set up using the WMT 2010 machine translation tasks. [sent-46, score-0.199]
</p><p>26 376 2  Evaluation metrics  This section describes the metrics used in our experiments. [sent-49, score-0.268]
</p><p>27 Given a reference text R and a translation candidate T, we generate the bag of all n-grams contained in R and T for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and denote them as BNGnR and BNGnT respectively. [sent-54, score-0.263]
</p><p>28 Its use of the brevity penalty is however questionable, as subsequent research on n-gram-based metrics has consistently found that recall is in fact a more potent indicator than precision (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Zhou et al. [sent-57, score-0.251]
</p><p>29 The metric is defined as the minimum number of edits needed to change a candidate translation T to the reference R, normalized by the length of the reference, i. [sent-62, score-0.4]
</p><p>30 TER is a strong contender as the leading new generation automatic metric and has been used in major evaluation campaigns such as GALE. [sent-66, score-0.233]
</p><p>31 3 TESLA-M TESLA1 is a family of linear programming-based metrics proposed by Liu et al. [sent-70, score-0.171]
</p><p>32 First, the metric emphasizes the content words by discounting the weight of an n-gram by 0. [sent-76, score-0.158]
</p><p>33 The goal of the linear programming problem is to assign weights to the links between the two BNGs, so as to maximize the sum of the products of the link weights and their corresponding similarity scores. [sent-81, score-0.127]
</p><p>34 Once the solution is found and let the maximized objective function value be S, the precision is computed as S over the sum of weights of the translation candidate n-grams. [sent-92, score-0.205]
</p><p>35 Similarly, the recall is S over the sum of weights of the reference n-grams. [sent-93, score-0.129]
</p><p>36 TESLA-M gains an edge over the previous two metrics by the use of lightweight linguistic features such as lemmas, synonym dictionaries, and POS Metric Spearman’s rho TESLA-F. [sent-97, score-0.225]
</p><p>37 89  Table 1: Selected system-level Spearman’s rho correlation with the human judgment for the intoEnglish task, as reported in WMT 2010. [sent-102, score-0.288]
</p><p>38 76  Table 2: Selected system-level Spearman’s rho correlation with the human judgment for the out-ofEnglish task, as reported in WMT 2010. [sent-108, score-0.288]
</p><p>39 According to the system-level correlation with human judgments (Tables 1and 2), it ranks top for the out-of-English task and very close to the top for the into-English task (Callison-Burch et al. [sent-112, score-0.146]
</p><p>40 Let R and T be the 3TESLA-F refers to the metric called TESLA in (Liu et al. [sent-121, score-0.158]
</p><p>41 To minimize confusion, in this work we call the metric TESLA-F and refer to the whole family of metrics as TESLA. [sent-123, score-0.329]
</p><p>42 reference and the translation candidate respectively,  both in English. [sent-139, score-0.21]
</p><p>43 and Hello , can be found in the English-French phrase table, and proper name Querrien is out-ofvocabulary, then a likely segmentation is: R: || | Good morning , sir . [sent-144, score-0.187]
</p><p>44 | || Each English phrase is then mapped to a bag of weighted French phrases using the phrase table, transforming the English sentences into confusion networks resembling Figures 2 and 3. [sent-146, score-0.18]
</p><p>45 French ngrams are extracted from these confusion network representations, known as pivot language n-grams. [sent-147, score-0.143]
</p><p>46 The bag of pivot language n-grams generated by R is then matched against that generated by T with the same linear programming formulation used in TESLA-M. [sent-148, score-0.17]
</p><p>47 Unlike BLEU and TESLA-M which rely on simple averages (geometric and arithmetic average respectively) to combine the component scores, TESLAF trains the weights over a set of human judgments using a linear ranking support vector machine (RSVM). [sent-150, score-0.164]
</p><p>48 However, the added complexity, in particular the use of the language model score and the tuning of the component weights appear to make it less stable than TESLA-M in practice. [sent-154, score-0.229]
</p><p>49 n1  3 Experimental setup We run our experiments in the setting of the WMT  2010 news commentary machine translation campaign, for three language pairs: 1. [sent-156, score-0.199]

</p><p>57 Table 6 shows the proportion of times each system produces the best translation among the four. [sent-273, score-0.198]
</p><p>58 Note that the values in each column do not add up to 100%, since the candidate translations are often identical, and even a different translation can receive the same human judgment. [sent-275, score-0.308]
</p><p>59 01, with the exception of TESLA-M vs TESLAF in the French-English task, BLEU vs TER in the Spanish-English task, and TESLA-M vs TESLA-F and BLEU vs TER in the German-English task. [sent-279, score-0.4]

</p><p>63 381  translation systems using the TESLA metrics leads to significantly better translation output. [sent-313, score-0.45]
</p><p>64 5 Discussion We examined the results manually,  and found that  the relationship between the types of mistakes each system makes and the characteristics of the corresponding metric to be intricate. [sent-314, score-0.158]
</p><p>65 As a metric, TESLA-M is certainly much more similar to BLEU than TER is, yet they behave very differently when used as a tuning metric. [sent-321, score-0.182]
</p><p>66 Comparing the translations from the two groups, the tendency of BLEU and TER to pick shorter paraphrases and to drop function words is unmistakable, often to the detriment of the translation quality. [sent-328, score-0.33]
</p><p>67 Interestingly, the human translations average only 22 words, so BLEU and TER translations are in fact much closer on average to the reference lengths, yet their translations often feel too short. [sent-330, score-0.424]
</p><p>68 Interestingly, by placing much more emphasis on the recall, TESLA-M and TESLA-F produce translations that are statistically too long, 382 but feel much more ‘correct’ lengthwise. [sent-334, score-0.14]
</p><p>69 Another reason may be that since the metric does not care much about function words, the language model is given more freedom to pick function words as it sees fit, without the fear of large penalties. [sent-338, score-0.158]
</p><p>70 Paradoxically, by reducing the weights of function words, we end up making better translations for them. [sent-339, score-0.158]
</p><p>71 TER is the only metric that allows cheap block movements, regardless of size or distance. [sent-340, score-0.158]
</p><p>72 Since extra resources including bitexts are needed in using TESLA-F, TESLA-M emerges as the MT evaluation  metric of choice for tuning SMT systems. [sent-345, score-0.34]
</p><p>73 6 Future work have presented empirical evidence that the TESLA metrics outperform BLEU for MT tuning in a hierarchical phrase-based SMT system. [sent-346, score-0.393]
</p><p>74 , 2010) investigated the effect of tuning a phrase-based SMT system and found that of the MT evaluation metrics that they tried, none of them could outperform like to verify whether  TESLA  BLEU. [sent-350, score-0.355]

</p><p>88 In the ideal case, such a modified BLEU metric would deliver results similar to that of TESLA-M, yet with a runtime cost closer to BLEU. [sent-409, score-0.189]
</p><p>89 It would also make porting existing tuning code easier. [sent-410, score-0.215]

<p>Author: Christof Monz</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech language modeling is commonly used as a component in statistical machine translation systems, but there is mixed evidence that its usage leads to significant improvements. We argue that its limited effectiveness is due to the lack of lexicalization. We introduce a new approach that builds a separate local language model for each word and part-of-speech pair. The resulting models lead to more context-sensitive probability distributions and we also exploit the fact that different local models are used to estimate the language model probability of each word during decoding. Our approach is evaluated for Arabic- and Chinese-to-English translation. We show that it leads to statistically significant improvements for multiple test sets and also across different genres, when compared against a competitive baseline and a system using a part-of-speech model.</p><p>3 0.17145585 <a title="22-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Corroborating_Text_Evaluation_Results_with_Heterogeneous_Measures.html">36 emnlp-2011-Corroborating Text Evaluation Results with Heterogeneous Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Enrique Amigo ; Julio Gonzalo ; Jesus Gimenez ; Felisa Verdejo</p><p>Abstract: Automatically produced texts (e.g. translations or summaries) are usually evaluated with n-gram based measures such as BLEU or ROUGE, while the wide set of more sophisticated measures that have been proposed in the last years remains largely ignored for practical purposes. In this paper we first present an indepth analysis of the state of the art in order to clarify this issue. After this, we formalize and verify empirically a set of properties that every text evaluation measure based on similarity to human-produced references satisfies. These properties imply that corroborating system improvements with additional measures always increases the overall reliability of the evaluation process.

<p>Author: Chang Liu ; Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Many machine translation evaluation metrics have been proposed after the seminal BLEU metric, and many among them have been found to consistently outperform BLEU, demonstrated by their better correlations with human judgment. It has long been the hope that by tuning machine translation systems against these new generation metrics, advances in automatic machine translation evaluation can lead directly to advances in automatic machine translation. However, to date there has been no unambiguous report that these new metrics can improve a state-of-theart machine translation system over its BLEUtuned baseline. In this paper, we demonstrate that tuning Joshua, a hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system, with the TESLA metrics results in significantly better humanjudged translation quality than the BLEUtuned baseline. TESLA-M in particular is simple and performs well in practice on large datasets. We release all our implementation under an open source license. It is our hope that this work will encourage the machine translation community to finally move away from BLEU as the unquestioned default and to consider the new generation metrics when tuning their systems.</p><p>2 0.7891233 <a title="22-lsi-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Corroborating_Text_Evaluation_Results_with_Heterogeneous_Measures.html">36 emnlp-2011-Corroborating Text Evaluation Results with Heterogeneous Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Enrique Amigo ; Julio Gonzalo ; Jesus Gimenez ; Felisa Verdejo</p><p>Abstract: Automatically produced texts (e.g. translations or summaries) are usually evaluated with n-gram based measures such as BLEU or ROUGE, while the wide set of more sophisticated measures that have been proposed in the last years remains largely ignored for practical purposes. In this paper we first present an indepth analysis of the state of the art in order to clarify this issue. After this, we formalize and verify empirically a set of properties that every text evaluation measure based on similarity to human-produced references satisfies. These properties imply that corroborating system improvements with additional measures always increases the overall reliability of the evaluation process. In addition, the greater the heterogeneity of the measures (which is measurable) the higher their combined reliability. These results support the use of heterogeneous measures in order to consolidate text evaluation results.</p><p>3 0.74963182 <a title="22-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Local_Language_Models.html">125 emnlp-2011-Statistical Machine Translation with Local Language Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Christof Monz</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech language modeling is commonly used as a component in statistical machine translation systems, but there is mixed evidence that its usage leads to significant improvements. We argue that its limited effectiveness is due to the lack of lexicalization. We introduce a new approach that builds a separate local language model for each word and part-of-speech pair. The resulting models lead to more context-sensitive probability distributions and we also exploit the fact that different local models are used to estimate the language model probability of each word during decoding. Our approach is evaluated for Arabic- and Chinese-to-English translation. We show that it leads to statistically significant improvements for multiple test sets and also across different genres, when compared against a competitive baseline and a system using a part-of-speech model.</p><p>4 0.66735375 <a title="22-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Domain_Adaptation_via_Pseudo_In-Domain_Data_Selection.html">44 emnlp-2011-Domain Adaptation via Pseudo In-Domain Data Selection</a></p>

<p>Author: Michel Galley ; Chris Quirk</p><p>Abstract: Minimum error rate training is a crucial component to many state-of-the-art NLP applications, such as machine translation and speech recognition. However, common evaluation functions such as BLEU or word error rate are generally highly non-convex and thus prone to search errors. In this paper, we present LP-MERT, an exact search algorithm for minimum error rate training that reaches the global optimum using a series of reductions to linear programming. Given a set of N-best lists produced from S input sentences, this algorithm finds a linear model that is globally optimal with respect to this set. We find that this algorithm is polynomial in N and in the size of the model, but exponential in S. We present extensions of this work that let us scale to reasonably large tuning sets (e.g., one thousand sentences), by either searching only promising regions of the parameter space, or by using a variant of LP-MERT that relies on a beam-search approximation. Experimental results show improvements over the standard Och algorithm.</p><p>6 0.57126611 <a title="22-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Watermarking_the_Outputs_of_Structured_Prediction_with_an_application_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation..html">148 emnlp-2011-Watermarking the Outputs of Structured Prediction with an application in Statistical Machine Translation.</a></p>

<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning factored probabilistic CCG grammars for semantic parsing from data containing sentences paired with logical-form meaning representations. Traditional CCG lexicons list lexical items that pair words and phrases with syntactic and semantic content. Such lexicons can be inefficient when words appear repeatedly with closely related lexical content. In this paper, we introduce factored lexicons, which include both lexemes to model word meaning and templates to model systematic variation in word usage. We also present an algorithm for learning factored CCG lexicons, along with a probabilistic parse-selection model. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach learns highly accurate parsers, whose generalization performance greatly from the lexical factoring. benefits</p><p>4 0.62019265 <a title="22-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous_Phrase_Dependency_Grammars_for_Machine_Translation.html">108 emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous Phrase Dependency Grammars for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Gimpel ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We present a quasi-synchronous dependency grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006) for machine translation in which the leaves of the tree are phrases rather than words as in previous work (Gimpel and Smith, 2009). This formulation allows us to combine structural components of phrase-based and syntax-based MT in a single model. We describe a method of extracting phrase dependencies from parallel text using a target-side dependency parser. For decoding, we describe a coarse-to-fine approach based on lattice dependency parsing of phrase lattices. We demonstrate performance improvements for Chinese-English and UrduEnglish translation over a phrase-based baseline. We also investigate the use of unsupervised dependency parsers, reporting encouraging preliminary results.</p><p>5 0.61779183 <a title="22-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Correcting_Semantic_Collocation_Errors_with_L1-induced_Paraphrases.html">35 emnlp-2011-Correcting Semantic Collocation Errors with L1-induced Paraphrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for automatic collocation error correction in learner English which is based on paraphrases extracted from parallel corpora. Our key assumption is that collocation errors are often caused by semantic similarity in the first language (L1language) of the writer. An analysis of a large corpus of annotated learner English confirms this assumption. We evaluate our approach on real-world learner data and show that L1-induced paraphrases outperform traditional approaches based on edit distance, homophones, and WordNet synonyms.</p><p>6 0.61569196 <a title="22-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_a_Parser_for_Machine_Translation_Reordering.html">136 emnlp-2011-Training a Parser for Machine Translation Reordering</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephen Tratz ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsers are critical components within many NLP systems. However, currently available dependency parsers each exhibit at least one of several weaknesses, including high running time, limited accuracy, vague dependency labels, and lack of nonprojectivity support. Furthermore, no commonly used parser provides additional shallow semantic interpretation, such as preposition sense disambiguation and noun compound interpretation. In this paper, we present a new dependency-tree conversion of the Penn Treebank along with its associated fine-grain dependency labels and a fast, accurate parser trained on it. We explain how a non-projective extension to shift-reduce parsing can be incorporated into non-directional easy-first parsing. The parser performs well when evaluated on the standard test section of the Penn Treebank, outperforming several popular open source dependency parsers; it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dependency parser capable of parsing more than 75 sentences per second at over 93% accuracy.</p><p>3 0.185693 <a title="75-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Structure_Prediction_with_Non-Parallel_Multilingual_Guidance.html">146 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Structure Prediction with Non-Parallel Multilingual Guidance</a></p>
<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen ; Dipanjan Das ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method for prediction of linguistic structure in a language for which only unlabeled data is available, using annotated data from a set of one or more helper languages. Our approach is based on a model that locally mixes between supervised models from the helper languages. Parallel data is not used, allowing the technique to be applied even in domains where human-translated texts are unavailable. We obtain state-of-theart performance for two tasks of structure prediction: unsupervised part-of-speech tagging and unsupervised dependency parsing.</p><p>4 0.16884586 <a title="75-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Local_Language_Models.html">125 emnlp-2011-Statistical Machine Translation with Local Language Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Christof Monz</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech language modeling is commonly used as a component in statistical machine translation systems, but there is mixed evidence that its usage leads to significant improvements. We argue that its limited effectiveness is due to the lack of lexicalization. We introduce a new approach that builds a separate local language model for each word and part-of-speech pair. The resulting models lead to more context-sensitive probability distributions and we also exploit the fact that different local models are used to estimate the language model probability of each word during decoding. Our approach is evaluated for Arabic- and Chinese-to-English translation. We show that it leads to statistically significant improvements for multiple test sets and also across different genres, when compared against a competitive baseline and a system using a part-of-speech model.</p><p>5 0.14315693 <a title="75-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Joint_Model_for_Extended_Semantic_Role_Labeling.html">7 emnlp-2011-A Joint Model for Extended Semantic Role Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Vivek Srikumar ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a model that extends semantic role labeling. Existing approaches independently analyze relations expressed by verb predicates or those expressed as nominalizations. However, sentences express relations via other linguistic phenomena as well. Furthermore, these phenomena interact with each other, thus restricting the structures they articulate. In this paper, we use this intuition to define a joint inference model that captures the inter-dependencies between verb semantic role labeling and relations expressed using prepositions. The scarcity of jointly labeled data presents a crucial technical challenge for learning a joint model. The key strength of our model is that we use existing structure predictors as black boxes. By enforcing consistency constraints between their predictions, we show improvements in the performance of both tasks without retraining the individual models.</p><p>6 0.14028063 <a title="75-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Dependency_Parsing_without_Gold_Part-of-Speech_Tags.html">141 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Dependency Parsing without Gold Part-of-Speech Tags</a></p>

<p>Author: Andre Martins ; Noah Smith ; Mario Figueiredo ; Pedro Aguiar</p><p>Abstract: Dual decomposition has been recently proposed as a way of combining complementary models, with a boost in predictive power. However, in cases where lightweight decompositions are not readily available (e.g., due to the presence of rich features or logical constraints), the original subgradient algorithm is inefficient. We sidestep that difficulty by adopting an augmented Lagrangian method that accelerates model consensus by regularizing towards the averaged votes. We show how first-order logical constraints can be handled efficiently, even though the corresponding subproblems are no longer combinatorial, and report experiments in dependency parsing, with state-of-the-art results. 1</p><p>5 0.56015873 <a title="75-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Simple_Word_Trigger_Method_for_Social_Tag_Suggestion.html">11 emnlp-2011-A Simple Word Trigger Method for Social Tag Suggestion</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiyuan Liu ; Xinxiong Chen ; Maosong Sun</p><p>Abstract: It is popular for users in Web 2.0 era to freely annotate online resources with tags. To ease the annotation process, it has been great interest in automatic tag suggestion. We propose a method to suggest tags according to the text description of a resource. By considering both the description and tags of a given resource as summaries to the resource written in two languages, we adopt word alignment models in statistical machine translation to bridge their vocabulary gap. Based on the translation probabilities between the words in descriptions and the tags estimated on a large set of description-tags pairs, we build a word trigger method (WTM) to suggest tags according to the words in a resource description. Experiments on real world datasets show that WTM is effective and robust compared with other methods. Moreover, WTM is relatively simple and efficient, which is practical for Web applications.</p><p>6 0.5506779 <a title="75-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Parse_Correction_with_Specialized_Models_for_Difficult_Attachment_Types.html">102 emnlp-2011-Parse Correction with Specialized Models for Difficult Attachment Types</a></p>

<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Yang Liu ; Qun Liu ; Shouxun Lin</p><p>Abstract: Although discriminative training guarantees to improve statistical machine translation by incorporating a large amount of overlapping features, it is hard to scale up to large data due to decoding complexity. We propose a new algorithm to generate translation forest of training data in linear time with the help of word alignment. Our algorithm also alleviates the oracle selection problem by ensuring that a forest always contains derivations that exactly yield the reference translation. With millions of features trained on 519K sentences in 0.03 second per sentence, our system achieves significant improvement by 0.84 BLEU over the baseline system on the NIST Chinese-English test sets.</p><p>3 0.79660136 <a title="75-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-A_novel_dependency-to-string_model_for_statistical_machine_translation.html">15 emnlp-2011-A novel dependency-to-string model for statistical machine translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Xie ; Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Dependency structure, as a first step towards semantics, is believed to be helpful to improve translation quality. However, previous works on dependency structure based models typically resort to insertion operations to complete translations, which make it difficult to specify ordering information in translation rules. In our model of this paper, we handle this problem by directly specifying the ordering information in head-dependents rules which represent the source side as head-dependents relations and the target side as strings. The head-dependents rules require only substitution operation, thus our model requires no heuristics or separate ordering models of the previous works to control the word order of translations. Large-scale experiments show that our model performs well on long distance reordering, and outperforms the state- of-the-art constituency-to-string model (+1.47 BLEU on average) and hierarchical phrasebased model (+0.46 BLEU on average) on two Chinese-English NIST test sets without resort to phrases or parse forest. For the first time, a source dependency structure based model catches up with and surpasses the state-of-theart translation models.</p><p>4 0.79470438 <a title="75-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Relation_Acquisition_using_Word_Classes_and_Partial_Patterns.html">113 emnlp-2011-Relation Acquisition using Word Classes and Partial Patterns</a></p>

This method can extract long tail instances of semantic relations like causality from rare and complex expressions in a large Japanese Web corpus in extreme cases, patterns that occur only once in the entire corpus. Such patterns are beyond the reach ofcurrent pattern based methods. We show that our method performs on par with state-of-the-art pattern based methods, and maintains a reasonable level of accuracy even for instances — — acquired from infrequent patterns. This ability to acquire long tail instances is crucial for risk management and innovation, where an exhaustive database of high-level semantic relations like causation is of vital importance.</p><p>5 0.79390138 <a title="75-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Discourse_Relations_for_Eliminating_Intra-sentence_Polarity_Ambiguities.html">142 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Discovery of Discourse Relations for Eliminating Intra-sentence Polarity Ambiguities</a></p>
<p>Author: Lanjun Zhou ; Binyang Li ; Wei Gao ; Zhongyu Wei ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of opinionated sentences with both positive and negative sentiments1 is a key challenge in sentiment analysis. This paper presents a novel unsupervised method for discovering intra-sentence level discourse relations for eliminating polarity ambiguities. Firstly, a discourse scheme with discourse constraints on polarity was defined empirically based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, a small set of cuephrase-based patterns were utilized to collect a large number of discourse instances which were later converted to semantic sequential representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsupervised method was adopted to generate, weigh and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for recognizing discourse relations. Experimental results showed that the proposed methods not only effectively recognized the defined discourse relations but also achieved significant improvement by integrating discourse information in sentence-level polarity classification.</p><p>6 0.79187298 <a title="75-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Relation_Extraction_with_Relation_Topics.html">114 emnlp-2011-Relation Extraction with Relation Topics</a></p>

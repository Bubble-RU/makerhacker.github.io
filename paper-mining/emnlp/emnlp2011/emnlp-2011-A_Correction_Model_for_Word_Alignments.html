<p>Author: Christos Christodoulopoulos ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a fully unsupervised syntactic class induction system formulated as a Bayesian multinomial mixture model, where each word type is constrained to belong to a single class. By using a mixture model rather than a sequence model (e.g., HMM), we are able to easily add multiple kinds of features, including those at both the type level (morphology features) and token level (context and alignment features, the latter from parallel corpora). Using only context features, our system yields results comparable to state-of-the art, far better than a similar model without the one-class-per-type constraint. Using the additional features provides added benefit, and our final system outperforms the best published results on most of the 25 corpora tested.</p><p>3 0.15150991 <a title="3-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous_Phrase_Dependency_Grammars_for_Machine_Translation.html">108 emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous Phrase Dependency Grammars for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Gimpel ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We present a quasi-synchronous dependency grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006) for machine translation in which the leaves of the tree are phrases rather than words as in previous work (Gimpel and Smith, 2009). This formulation allows us to combine structural components of phrase-based and syntax-based MT in a single model. We describe a method of extracting phrase dependencies from parallel text using a target-side dependency parser. For decoding, we describe a coarse-to-fine approach based on lattice dependency parsing of phrase lattices. We demonstrate performance improvements for Chinese-English and UrduEnglish translation over a phrase-based baseline. We also investigate the use of unsupervised dependency parsers, reporting encouraging preliminary results.</p><p>4 0.15129645 <a title="3-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Word_Reordering_Model_for_Improved_Machine_Translation.html">13 emnlp-2011-A Word Reordering Model for Improved Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Karthik Visweswariah ; Rajakrishnan Rajkumar ; Ankur Gandhe ; Ananthakrishnan Ramanathan ; Jiri Navratil</p><p>Abstract: Preordering of source side sentences has proved to be useful in improving statistical machine translation. Most work has used a parser in the source language along with rules to map the source language word order into the target language word order. The requirement to have a source language parser is a major drawback, which we seek to overcome in this paper. Instead of using a parser and then using rules to order the source side sentence we learn a model that can directly reorder source side sentences to match target word order using a small parallel corpus with highquality word alignments. Our model learns pairwise costs of a word immediately preced- ing another word. We use the Lin-Kernighan heuristic to find the best source reordering efficiently during training and testing and show that it suffices to provide good quality reordering. We show gains in translation performance based on our reordering model for translating from Hindi to English, Urdu to English (with a public dataset), and English to Hindi. For English to Hindi we show that our technique achieves better performance than a method that uses rules applied to the source side English parse.</p><p>5 0.14875217 <a title="3-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Inducing_Sentence_Structure_from_Parallel_Corpora_for_Reordering.html">74 emnlp-2011-Inducing Sentence Structure from Parallel Corpora for Reordering</a></p>
<p>Author: John DeNero ; Jakob Uszkoreit</p><p>Abstract: When translating among languages that differ substantially in word order, machine translation (MT) systems benefit from syntactic preorderingâ€”an approach that uses features from a syntactic parse to permute source words into a target-language-like order. This paper presents a method for inducing parse trees automatically from a parallel corpus, instead of using a supervised parser trained on a treebank. These induced parses are used to preorder source sentences. We demonstrate that our induced parser is effective: it not only improves a state-of-the-art phrase-based system with integrated reordering, but also approaches the performance of a recent preordering method based on a supervised parser. These results show that the syntactic structure which is relevant to MT pre-ordering can be learned automatically from parallel text, thus establishing a new application for unsupervised grammar induction.</p><p>6 0.1472141 <a title="3-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Multi-Source_Transfer_of_Delexicalized_Dependency_Parsers.html">95 emnlp-2011-Multi-Source Transfer of Delexicalized Dependency Parsers</a></p>

<p>Author: Kristian Woodsend ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: Text simplification aims to rewrite text into simpler versions, and thus make information accessible to a broader audience. Most previous work simplifies sentences using handcrafted rules aimed at splitting long sentences, or substitutes difficult words using a predefined dictionary. This paper presents a datadriven model based on quasi-synchronous grammar, a formalism that can naturally capture structural mismatches and complex rewrite operations. We describe how such a grammar can be induced from Wikipedia and propose an integer linear programming model for selecting the most appropriate simplification from the space of possible rewrites generated by the grammar. We show experimentally that our method creates simplifications that significantly reduce the reading difficulty ofthe input, while maintaining grammaticality and preserving its meaning.</p><p>3 0.60542834 <a title="3-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Generating_Subsequent_Reference_in_Shared_Visual_Scenes%3A_Computation_vs_Re-Use.html">62 emnlp-2011-Generating Subsequent Reference in Shared Visual Scenes: Computation vs Re-Use</a></p>
<p>Author: Jette Viethen ; Robert Dale ; Markus Guhe</p><p>Abstract: Traditional computational approaches to referring expression generation operate in a deliberate manner, choosing the attributes to be included on the basis of their ability to distinguish the intended referent from its distractors. However, work in psycholinguistics suggests that speakers align their referring expressions with those used previously in the discourse, implying less deliberate choice and more subconscious reuse. This raises the question as to which is a more accurate characterisation of what people do. Using a corpus of dialogues containing 16,358 referring expressions, we explore this question via the generation of subsequent references in shared visual scenes. We use a machine learning approach to referring expression generation and demonstrate that incorporating features that correspond to the computational tradition does not match human referring behaviour as well as using features corresponding to the process of alignment. The results support the view that the traditional model of referring expression generation that is widely assumed in work on natural language generation may not in fact be correct; our analysis may also help explain the oft-observed redundancy found in humanproduced referring expressions.</p><p>4 0.60059518 <a title="3-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Bayesian_Mixture_Model_for_PoS_Induction_Using_Multiple_Features.html">1 emnlp-2011-A Bayesian Mixture Model for PoS Induction Using Multiple Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Deepak Agarwal ; Bee-Chung Chen ; Bo Pang</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, the amount of user-generated opinionated texts (e.g., reviews, user comments) continues to grow at a rapid speed: featured news stories on a major event easily attract thousands of user comments on a popular online News service. How to consume subjective information ofthis volume becomes an interesting and important research question. In contrast to previous work on review analysis that tried to filter or summarize information for a generic average user, we explore a different direction of enabling personalized recommendation of such information. For each user, our task is to rank the comments associated with a given article according to personalized user preference (i.e., whether the user is likely to like or dislike the comment). To this end, we propose a factor model that incorporates rater-comment and rater-author interactions simultaneously in a principled way. Our full model significantly outperforms strong baselines as well as related models that have been considered in previous work.</p><p>2 0.94207352 <a title="3-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Tweets%3A_An_Experimental_Study.html">98 emnlp-2011-Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Sam Clark ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: People tweet more than 100 Million times daily, yielding a noisy, informal, but sometimes informative corpus of 140-character messages that mirrors the zeitgeist in an unprecedented manner. The performance of standard NLP tools is severely degraded on tweets. This paper addresses this issue by re-building the NLP pipeline beginning with part-of-speech tagging, through chunking, to named-entity recognition. Our novel T-NER system doubles F1 score compared with the Stanford NER system. T-NER leverages the redundancy inherent in tweets to achieve this performance, using LabeledLDA to exploit Freebase dictionaries as a source of distant supervision. LabeledLDA outperforms cotraining, increasing F1 by 25% over ten common entity types.

<p>Author: Stephen Tratz ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsers are critical components within many NLP systems. However, currently available dependency parsers each exhibit at least one of several weaknesses, including high running time, limited accuracy, vague dependency labels, and lack of nonprojectivity support. Furthermore, no commonly used parser provides additional shallow semantic interpretation, such as preposition sense disambiguation and noun compound interpretation. In this paper, we present a new dependency-tree conversion of the Penn Treebank along with its associated fine-grain dependency labels and a fast, accurate parser trained on it. We explain how a non-projective extension to shift-reduce parsing can be incorporated into non-directional easy-first parsing. The parser performs well when evaluated on the standard test section of the Penn Treebank, outperforming several popular open source dependency parsers; it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dependency parser capable of parsing more than 75 sentences per second at over 93% accuracy.</p><p>4 0.90147567 <a title="3-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Linking_Entities_to_a_Knowledge_Base_with_Query_Expansion.html">90 emnlp-2011-Linking Entities to a Knowledge Base with Query Expansion</a></p>
<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to entity linking based on a statistical language model-based information retrieval with query expansion. We use both local contexts and global world knowledge to expand query language models. We place a strong emphasis on named entities in the local contexts and explore a positional language model to weigh them differently based on their distances to the query. Our experiments on the TAC-KBP 2010 data show that incorporating such contextual information indeed aids in disambiguating the named entities and consistently improves the entity linking performance. Compared with the official results from KBP 2010 participants, our system shows competitive performance.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.88994575 <a title="3-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Correction_Model_for_Word_Alignments.html">3 emnlp-2011-A Correction Model for Word Alignments</a></p>
<p>Author: J. Scott McCarley ; Abraham Ittycheriah ; Salim Roukos ; Bing Xiang ; Jian-ming Xu</p><p>Abstract: Models of word alignment built as sequences of links have limited expressive power, but are easy to decode. Word aligners that model the alignment matrix can express arbitrary alignments, but are difficult to decode. We propose an alignment matrix model as a correction algorithm to an underlying sequencebased aligner. Then a greedy decoding algorithm enables the full expressive power of the alignment matrix formulation. Improved alignment performance is shown for all nine language pairs tested. The improved alignments also improved translation quality from Chinese to English and English to Italian.</p><p>6 0.87322098 <a title="3-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Bootstrapped_Named_Entity_Recognition_for_Product_Attribute_Extraction.html">23 emnlp-2011-Bootstrapped Named Entity Recognition for Product Attribute Extraction</a></p>

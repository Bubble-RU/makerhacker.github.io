</p><p>3 1 Introduction Data-driven dependency parsing has seen a considerable surge of interest in recent years. [sent-4, score-0.263]
</p><p>4 The evaluation metric traditionally associated with dependency parsing is based on scoring labeled or unlabeled attachment decisions, whereby each correctly identified pair of head-dependent words is counted towards the success of the parser (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006). [sent-8, score-0.44]

</p><p>9 This paper proposes a new three-step protocol for cross-experiment parser evaluation, and in particular for comparing parsing results across data sets that adhere to different annotation schemes. [sent-22, score-0.404]

</p><p>11 The last step computes the normalized distance from this common denominator to parse hypotheses, minus the cost of distances that reflect mere annotation idiosyncrasies. [sent-27, score-0.288]
</p><p>12 We use the proposed procedure to compare de-  pendency parsing results trained on Penn Treebank trees converted into dependency trees according to five different sets of linguistic assumptions. [sent-29, score-0.719]
</p><p>13 We show that when starting off with the same set of sentences and the same parser, training on different conversion schemes yields apparently significant performance gaps. [sent-30, score-0.302]
</p><p>14 When results across schemes are normalized and compared against the shared linguistic content, these performance gaps decrease or dissolve completely. [sent-31, score-0.37]
</p><p>15 Even if the formal representation in a dependency treebank is well-defined according to current standards (K¨ ubler et al. [sent-35, score-0.451]
</p><p>16 When multiple conversion algorithms are applied to the same data, we end up with different dependency trees for the same sentences (Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Choi and Palmer, 2010; de Marneffe et al. [sent-40, score-0.514]
</p><p>17 In linguistics, there is a distinction between lexical heads and functional heads. [sent-45, score-0.388]
</p><p>18 A lexical head carries the semantic gist of a phrase while a functional one marks its relation to other parts of the sentence. [sent-46, score-0.398]
</p><p>19 This phrase has two possible analyses, one selects a lexical head (1a) and the other selects a functional one (1b), as depicted below. [sent-49, score-0.398]

</p><p>23 If parse1 and parse2 are compared against gold2 using labeled attachment scores (LAS), then parse1 results are lower than the results of parse2, even though both parsers produced linguistically correct and perfectly useful output. [sent-70, score-0.219]
</p><p>24 Existing methods for making parsing results comparable across experiments include heuristics for converting outputs into dependency trees of a predefined standard (Briscoe et al. [sent-71, score-0.514]
</p><p>25 ×  In this section we first define functional trees as the common space of formal objects and define a deterministic conversion procedure from dependency trees to functional trees. [sent-89, score-1.535]
</p><p>26 Next we define a set of formal operations on functional trees that compute, for every pair ofcorresponding trees of the same yield, a single gold tree that resolves inconsistencies among gold standard alternatives and combines the information that they share. [sent-90, score-1.337]
</p><p>27 Finally, we define scores based on tree edit distance, refined to consider the distance from parses to the overall gold tree as well as the different annotation alternatives. [sent-91, score-0.717]

</p><p>29 , tn is any dependency graph that is a directed tree originating out of a node v0 labeled t0 = ROOT, and spans all terminals in the sentence, that is, for every ti ∈ S there exists vj ∈ Vd labeled labelV(vj) = ti. [sent-100, score-0.601]
</p><p>30 F∈or simplicity we  assume that every node vj is indexed according to the position of the terminal label, i. [sent-101, score-0.222]

</p><p>32 We define two auxiliary functions on nodes in dependency trees. [sent-105, score-0.246]
</p><p>33 1 Step 1: Functional Representation Our first goal is to define a representation format that keeps all functional relationships that are represented in the dependency trees intact, but remains neutral with respect to the directionality of the head-dependent relations. [sent-108, score-0.707]
</p><p>34 To do so we define functional trees linearly-ordered labeled trees which, instead of head-to-head binary relations, represent the complete functional structure of a sentence. [sent-109, score-1.124]
</p><p>35 All 1If a dependency tree d is projective, than for all v ∈ Vd the termiIfn aals d einp span(v) rfoeerm d a contiguous segment oalfl lS v. [sent-111, score-0.32]
</p><p>36 388 terminal nodes in π are labeled with terminal symbols via a labelT : V → T function. [sent-114, score-0.28]
</p><p>37 We obtain functional trees from dependency t vrieaes A using tohbet following procedure: • Initialize the set of nodes and arcs in the tree. [sent-117, score-0.88]
</p><p>38 This gives us a constituency-  =  like representation of dependency trees labeled with functional information, tic assumptions  which retains the linguis-  reflected in the dependency  trees. [sent-121, score-1.001]
</p><p>39 In order to compare, combine or detect inconsistencies in the information inherent in different functional trees, we define a set of formal operations that are inspired by familiar notions from unification-based formalisms (Shieber (1986) and references therein). [sent-145, score-0.487]
</p><p>40 A completely flat tree over a span is the most general structural description that can be given to it. [sent-147, score-0.298]
</p><p>41 If an arc structure in one tree merely elaborates an existing flat span in another tree, the theories underlying the schemes are compatible, and their information can be combined. [sent-149, score-0.571]
</p><p>42 , remove functional nodes, in order to obtain a coherent structure that contains the information on which they agree. [sent-152, score-0.327]
</p><p>43 Let π1 , π2 be functional trees over the same yield t1, . [sent-153, score-0.529]
</p><p>44 Let the function span(v) pick out the terminals labeling terminal nodes that are accessible via a node v ∈ V in the functional tree through the 389 relation A. [sent-156, score-0.697]
</p><p>45 s that a tree π1 is consistent with and more general than tree π2. [sent-160, score-0.284]
</p><p>46 Looking at the functional trees of (4a)–(4b) we see that their unlabeled skeletons mutually subsume each other. [sent-164, score-0.529]
</p><p>47 In their labeled versions, however, each tree contains labeling information that is lacking in  the other. [sent-165, score-0.252]
</p><p>48 In the functional trees (5b)–(5c) a flat structure over a span in (5b) is more elaborated in (5c). [sent-166, score-0.685]
</p><p>49 In order to combine information in trees with compatible arc structures, we define tree unification. [sent-167, score-0.449]
</p><p>50 In case of an inconsistency, as is the case in the functional trees (6a) and (6b), we cannot unify the structures due to a conflict concerning the internal division of an expression into phrases. [sent-180, score-0.592]
</p><p>51 However, we still want to generalize these two trees into one tree that contains all and only the information that they share. [sent-181, score-0.344]
</p><p>52 For every pair of trees there exists a tree that is more general than both: in the extreme case, pick the completely flat structure over the yield, which is more general than any other structure. [sent-198, score-0.405]
</p><p>53 The generalization of two functional trees provides us with one structure that reflects the common and consistent content of the two trees. [sent-202, score-0.578]
</p><p>54 These structures thus provide us with a formally well-defined gold standard for cross-treebank evaluation. [sent-203, score-0.26]
</p><p>55 Our functional trees superficially look like constituency-based trees, so a simple proposal would be to use Parse-  ‘vg  val measures (Black et al. [sent-205, score-0.529]
</p><p>56 , 1991) for comparing the parsed trees against the new generalized gold trees. [sent-206, score-0.484]
</p><p>57 Here we propose to adopt measures that are based on tree edit distance (TED) instead. [sent-211, score-0.344]
</p><p>58 TEDbased measures are, in fact, an extension of attachment scores for dependency trees. [sent-212, score-0.228]
</p><p>59 Consider, for instance, the following operations on dependency arcs. [sent-213, score-0.273]
</p><p>60 3 Here we apply the idea of defining scores by TED costs  normalized relative to the size of the tree and substracted from a unity, and extend it from fixed-size dependency trees to ordered trees of arbitrary size. [sent-216, score-0.724]
</p><p>61 relabel-node change the label of node v in π delete-node delete a non-root node v in π with parent u, making the children of v the children of u, inserted in the place of v as a subsequence in the left-to-right order of the children of u. [sent-220, score-0.221]
</p><p>62 An optimal edit script is an edit script between π1 and π2 of minimum cost. [sent-229, score-0.468]
</p><p>63 (π1  cost(e) ,π2  )  The tree edit distance problem is defined to be the problem of finding the optimal edit script and computing the corresponding distance (Bille, 2005). [sent-232, score-0.629]
</p><p>64 A simple way to calculate the error δ of a parse would be to define it as the edit distance between the parse hypothesis π1 and the gold standard π2. [sent-233, score-0.466]
</p><p>65 To solve this, we refine the distance between a parse tree and the generalized gold tree to discard edit operations on nodes that are there in the native gold tree but are eliminated through generalization. [sent-235, score-1.225]
</p><p>66 We compute the intersection of the edit  script turning the parse tree into the generalize gold with the edit script turning the native gold tree into the generalized gold, and discard its cost. [sent-236, score-1.186]
</p><p>67 Different versions of the treebank go into different experiments,  resulting in  different parse and gold files. [sent-241, score-0.265]
</p><p>68 The different  δ arcs represent  the different tree distances used for calculating the TED-based scores. [sent-244, score-0.305]
</p><p>69 In the worst case, we would have to remove all the internal nodes in the parse tree and add all the internal nodes of the generalized gold, so our normalization factor ι is defined as follows, where |π| is the size4 of π. [sent-250, score-0.408]
</p><p>70 We start off with two versions of the treebank, TB 1 and TB2, which are parsed separately and provide their own gold standards and parse hypotheses in a labeled dependencies format. [sent-252, score-0.337]

</p><p>74 6 We finally compute the distances δnew (parse1,gold1,gold3) and δnew (parse2,gold2,gold3) using the different tree edit distances that are now available, and we repeat the procedure for each sentence in the test set. [sent-257, score-0.461]

</p><p>90 In fact, when evaluating the effect of linguistically disparate annotation variations such as Lexical and Functional on the performance of MaltParser, Table 1 shows that when using TEDEVAL and a generalized gold the performance gaps are small and statistically insignificant. [sent-355, score-0.503]
</p><p>91 In evaluating against a three-way generalization, all the results obtained for different training schemes are on a par with one another, with minor gaps in performance, rarely statistically significant. [sent-359, score-0.319]
</p><p>92 This suggests that apparent performance  trends between experiments when evaluating with respect to the training schemes may be misleading. [sent-360, score-0.231]
</p><p>93 In each of the tables, results obtained against the training schemes show significant differences whereas applying our cross-experimental procedure shows small to no gaps in performance across different schemes. [sent-362, score-0.357]
</p><p>94 As it turns out, this problem arises in NLP in different shapes and forms; when evaluating a parser against different annotation schemes, when evaluating parsing performance across parsers and different formalisms, and when  comparing parser performance across languages.

<p>Author: Stephen Tratz ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsers are critical components within many NLP systems. However, currently available dependency parsers each exhibit at least one of several weaknesses, including high running time, limited accuracy, vague dependency labels, and lack of nonprojectivity support. Furthermore, no commonly used parser provides additional shallow semantic interpretation, such as preposition sense disambiguation and noun compound interpretation. In this paper, we present a new dependency-tree conversion of the Penn Treebank along with its associated fine-grain dependency labels and a fast, accurate parser trained on it. We explain how a non-projective extension to shift-reduce parsing can be incorporated into non-directional easy-first parsing. The parser performs well when evaluated on the standard test section of the Penn Treebank, outperforming several popular open source dependency parsers; it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dependency parser capable of parsing more than 75 sentences per second at over 93% accuracy.</p><p>3 0.15119846 <a title="50-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Parser_Evaluation_over_Local_and_Non-Local_Deep_Dependencies_in_a_Large_Corpus.html">103 emnlp-2011-Parser Evaluation over Local and Non-Local Deep Dependencies in a Large Corpus</a></p>

This formulation allows us to combine structural components of phrase-based and syntax-based MT in a single model. We describe a method of extracting phrase dependencies from parallel text using a target-side dependency parser. For decoding, we describe a coarse-to-fine approach based on lattice dependency parsing of phrase lattices. We demonstrate performance improvements for Chinese-English and UrduEnglish translation over a phrase-based baseline. We also investigate the use of unsupervised dependency parsers, reporting encouraging preliminary results.</p><p>5 0.14593878 <a title="50-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_dependency_parsers_by_jointly_optimizing_multiple_objectives.html">137 emnlp-2011-Training dependency parsers by jointly optimizing multiple objectives</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephen Tratz ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: Dependency parsers are critical components within many NLP systems. However, currently available dependency parsers each exhibit at least one of several weaknesses, including high running time, limited accuracy, vague dependency labels, and lack of nonprojectivity support. Furthermore, no commonly used parser provides additional shallow semantic interpretation, such as preposition sense disambiguation and noun compound interpretation. In this paper, we present a new dependency-tree conversion of the Penn Treebank along with its associated fine-grain dependency labels and a fast, accurate parser trained on it. We explain how a non-projective extension to shift-reduce parsing can be incorporated into non-directional easy-first parsing. The parser performs well when evaluated on the standard test section of the Penn Treebank, outperforming several popular open source dependency parsers; it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dependency parser capable of parsing more than 75 sentences per second at over 93% accuracy.</p><p>3 0.71819884 <a title="50-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Parser_Evaluation_over_Local_and_Non-Local_Deep_Dependencies_in_a_Large_Corpus.html">103 emnlp-2011-Parser Evaluation over Local and Non-Local Deep Dependencies in a Large Corpus</a></p>

<p>Author: Enrique Henestroza Anguiano ; Marie Candito</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops a framework for syntactic dependency parse correction. Dependencies in an input parse tree are revised by selecting, for a given dependent, the best governor from within a small set of candidates. We use a discriminative linear ranking model to select the best governor from a group of candidates for a dependent, and our model includes a rich feature set that encodes syntactic structure in the input parse tree. The parse correction framework is parser-agnostic, and can correct attachments using either a generic model or specialized models tailored to difficult attachment types like coordination and pp-attachment. Our experiments show that parse correction, combining a generic model with specialized models for difficult attachment types, can successfully improve the quality of predicted parse trees output by sev- eral representative state-of-the-art dependency parsers for French.</p><p>5 0.5253424 <a title="50-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_dependency_parsers_by_jointly_optimizing_multiple_objectives.html">137 emnlp-2011-Training dependency parsers by jointly optimizing multiple objectives</a></p>

<p>Author: Federico Sangati ; Willem Zuidema</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP). Like other DOP models, our parser utilizes syntactic fragments of arbitrary size from a treebank to analyze new sentences, but, crucially, it uses only those which are encountered at least twice. This criterion allows us to work with a relatively small but representative set of fragments, which can be employed as the symbolic backbone of several probabilistic generative models. For parsing we define a transform-backtransform approach that allows us to use standard PCFG technology, making our results easily replicable. According to standard Parseval metrics, our best model is on par with many state-ofthe-art parsers, while offering some complementary benefits: a simple generative probability model, and an explicit representation of the larger units of grammar.</p><p>3 0.43263319 <a title="50-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Structured_Lexical_Similarity_via_Convolution_Kernels_on_Dependency_Trees.html">127 emnlp-2011-Structured Lexical Similarity via Convolution Kernels on Dependency Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Spence Green ; Marie-Catherine de Marneffe ; John Bauer ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Multiword expressions (MWE), a known nuisance for both linguistics and NLP, blur the lines between syntax and semantics. Previous work on MWE identification has relied primarily on surface statistics, which perform poorly for longer MWEs and cannot model discontinuous expressions. To address these problems, we show that even the simplest parsing models can effectively identify MWEs of arbitrary length, and that Tree Substitution Grammars achieve the best results. Our experiments show a 36.4% F1 absolute improvement for French over an n-gram surface statistics baseline, currently the predominant method for MWE identification. Our models are useful for several NLP tasks in which MWE pre-grouping has improved accuracy. 1</p><p>5 0.39422402 <a title="50-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Reducing_Grounded_Learning_Tasks_To_Grammatical_Inference.html">111 emnlp-2011-Reducing Grounded Learning Tasks To Grammatical Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Borschinger ; Bevan K. Jones ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: It is often assumed that ‘grounded’ learning tasks are beyond the scope of grammatical inference techniques. In this paper, we show that the grounded task of learning a semantic parser from ambiguous training data as discussed in Kim and Mooney (2010) can be reduced to a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar learning task in a way that gives state of the art results. We further show that additionally letting our model learn the language’s canonical word order improves its performance and leads to the highest semantic parsing f-scores previously reported in the literature.1</p><p>6 0.39410472 <a title="50-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Efficient_retrieval_of_tree_translation_examples_for_Syntax-Based_Machine_Translation.html">47 emnlp-2011-Efficient retrieval of tree translation examples for Syntax-Based Machine Translation</a></p>

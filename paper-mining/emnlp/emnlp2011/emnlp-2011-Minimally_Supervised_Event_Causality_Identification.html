This paper presents a novel unsupervised method for discovering intra-sentence level discourse relations for eliminating polarity ambiguities. Firstly, a discourse scheme with discourse constraints on polarity was defined empirically based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, a small set of cuephrase-based patterns were utilized to collect a large number of discourse instances which were later converted to semantic sequential representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsupervised method was adopted to generate, weigh and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for recognizing discourse relations.

<p>Author: Amit Dubey ; Frank Keller ; Patrick Sturt</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a psycholinguistic model of sentence processing which combines a Hidden Markov Model noun phrase chunker with a co-reference classifier. Both models are fully incremental and generative, giving probabilities of lexical elements conditional upon linguistic structure. This allows us to compute the information theoretic measure of surprisal, which is known to correlate with human processing effort. We evaluate our surprisal predictions on the Dundee corpus of eye-movement data show that our model achieve a better fit with human reading times than a syntax-only model which does not have access to co-reference information.</p><p>5 0.10241692 <a title="92-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Entire_Relaxation_Path_for_Maximum_Entropy_Problems.html">49 emnlp-2011-Entire Relaxation Path for Maximum Entropy Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Moshe Dubiner ; Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We discuss and analyze the problem of finding a distribution that minimizes the relative entropy to a prior distribution while satisfying max-norm constraints with respect to an observed distribution. This setting generalizes the classical maximum entropy problems as it relaxes the standard constraints on the observed values. We tackle the problem by introducing a re-parametrization in which the unknown distribution is distilled to a single scalar. We then describe a homotopy between the relaxation parameter and the distribution characterizing parameter. The homotopy also reveals an aesthetic symmetry between the prior distribution and the observed distribution. We then use the reformulated problem to describe a space and time efficient algorithm for tracking the entire relaxation path. Our derivations are based on a compact geomet- ric view of the relaxation path as a piecewise linear function in a two dimensional space of the relaxation-characterization parameters. We demonstrate the usability of our approach by applying the problem to Zipfian distributions over a large alphabet.</p><p>6 0.098606721 <a title="92-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Fast_and_Robust_Joint_Models_for_Biomedical_Event_Extraction.html">59 emnlp-2011-Fast and Robust Joint Models for Biomedical Event Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Extracting biomedical events from literature has attracted much recent attention. The bestperforming systems so far have been pipelines of simple subtask-specific local classifiers. A natural drawback of such approaches are cascading errors introduced in early stages of the pipeline. We present three joint models of increasing complexity designed to overcome this problem. The first model performs joint trigger and argument extraction, and lends itself to a simple, efficient and exact inference algorithm. The second model captures correlations between events, while the third model ensures consistency between arguments of the same event. Inference in these models is kept tractable through dual decomposition. The first two models outperform the previous best joint approaches and are very competitive with respect to the current state-of-theart. The third model yields the best results reported so far on the BioNLP 2009 shared task, the BioNLP 2011 Genia task and the BioNLP 2011Infectious Diseases task.</p><p>6 0.28569365 <a title="92-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Learning_of_Selectional_Restrictions_and_Detection_of_Argument_Coercions.html">144 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Learning of Selectional Restrictions and Detection of Argument Coercions</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhiyuan Liu ; Xinxiong Chen ; Maosong Sun</p><p>Abstract: It is popular for users in Web 2.0 era to freely annotate online resources with tags. To ease the annotation process, it has been great interest in automatic tag suggestion. We propose a method to suggest tags according to the text description of a resource. By considering both the description and tags of a given resource as summaries to the resource written in two languages, we adopt word alignment models in statistical machine translation to bridge their vocabulary gap. Based on the translation probabilities between the words in descriptions and the tags estimated on a large set of description-tags pairs, we build a word trigger method (WTM) to suggest tags according to the words in a resource description. Experiments on real world datasets show that WTM is effective and robust compared with other methods. Moreover, WTM is relatively simple and efficient, which is practical for Web applications.</p><p>3 0.57155597 <a title="92-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Discourse_Relations_for_Eliminating_Intra-sentence_Polarity_Ambiguities.html">142 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Discovery of Discourse Relations for Eliminating Intra-sentence Polarity Ambiguities</a></p>

Cherry@ nrc-cnrc . gc . ca in Redmond, WA 98052 bi l ldol @mi cro so ft . com large corpus of status-response pairs found on Twitter to create a system that responds to Twitter status We present a data-driven approach to generating responses to Twitter status posts, based on phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation. We find that mapping conversational stimuli onto responses is more difficult than translating between languages, due to the wider range of possible responses, the larger fraction of unaligned words/phrases, and the presence of large phrase pairs whose alignment cannot be further decomposed. After addressing these challenges, we compare approaches based on SMT and Information Retrieval in a human evaluation. We show that SMT outperforms IR on this task, and its output is preferred over actual human responses in 15% of cases. As far as we are aware, this is the first work to investigate the use of phrase-based SMT to directly translate a linguistic stimulus into an appropriate response.</p><p>6 0.56519014 <a title="92-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Third-order_Variational_Reranking_on_Packed-Shared_Dependency_Forests.html">134 emnlp-2011-Third-order Variational Reranking on Packed-Shared Dependency Forests</a></p>

</p><p>6 1 Introduction Many practical tasks require accessing specific types of information in scientific literature. [sent-14, score-0.148]
</p><p>7 For example, a reader of scientific literature may be looking for information about the objective of the study in question, the methods used in the study, the results obtained, or the conclusions drawn by authors. [sent-15, score-0.148]
</p><p>8 Some of these classify sentences according to typical section names seen in scientific documents (Lin et al. [sent-18, score-0.148]

</p><p>10 However, relying on fully supervised machine learning (ML) and a large body of annotated data, existing approaches are expensive to develop and port to different scientific domains and tasks. [sent-31, score-0.27]

</p><p>13 They have been applied to a wide range of NLP tasks, including named-entity recognition, question answering, information extraction, text classification and many others (Abney, 2008), yielding performance levels similar or equivalent to those of fully supervised techniques.

</p><p>15 Recent experiments have demonstrated the usefulness of weakly-supervised learning for classifying discourse relations in scientific texts, e. [sent-40, score-0.196]
</p><p>16 In this paper, we investigate the potential of  weakly-supervised learning for Argumentative Zoning (AZ) of scientific abstracts. [sent-45, score-0.148]
</p><p>17 AZ is an approach to information structure which provides an analysis of the rhetorical progression of the scientific argument in a document (Teufel and Moens, 2002). [sent-46, score-0.242]
</p><p>18 It has been used to analyze scientific texts in various disciplines including computational linguistics (Teufel and Moens, 2002), law, (Hachey and Grover, 2006), biology (Mizuta et al. [sent-47, score-0.202]
</p><p>19 This suggests that a weakly-supervised approach would be more practical than a fully supervised one for the real-world application of AZ. [sent-52, score-0.122]
</p><p>20 Our best weaklysupervised classifier (Active SVM with selftraining) outperforms the best supervised classifier (SVM), yielding high accuracy of 81% when using just 10% of the labeled data. [sent-55, score-0.392]
</p><p>21 When using just one third of the labeled data, it performs equally well as a fully supervised SVM which uses 100% of the labeled data. [sent-56, score-0.373]
</p><p>22 Our investigation suggests that weaklysupervised learning could be employed to improve the practical applicability and portability of AZ to different information access tasks. [sent-57, score-0.206]
</p><p>23 (2010) provide a corpus of 1000 biomedical abstracts (consisting of 7985 sentences and 225785 words) annotated according to three schemes of information structure those based on section names (Hirohata et al. [sent-61, score-0.192]
</p><p>24 AZ is a scheme which provides an analysis of the rhetorical progression of the scientific argument, following the knowledge claims made by authors. [sent-67, score-0.285]
</p><p>25 Seven categories of this scheme (out of the 10 possible) actually appear in abstracts and in the resulting corpus. [sent-76, score-0.151]
</p><p>26 For example, the Method zone (METH) is for sentences which describe a way of doing research, esp. [sent-78, score-0.088]

</p><p>36 2 Machine learning methods Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) have proved the best performing fully supervised methods in most recent works on information structure, e. [sent-172, score-0.176]
</p><p>37 We therefore implemented these methods as well as weakly supervised variations of them: active SVM with and without self-training, transductive SVM and semi-supervised CRF. [sent-178, score-0.337]

</p><p>39 2 Weakly-supervised methods Active SVM (ASVM) starts with a small amount of labeled data, and iteratively chooses a proportion of unlabeled data for which SVM has less confidence to be labeled (the labels can be restored from the original corpus) and used in the next round of learning, i. [sent-197, score-0.283]
</p><p>40 Active SVM with self-training (ASSVM) is an extension of ASVM where each round of training has two steps: (i) training on the labeled, and testing on the unlabeled data, and querying; (ii) training on both labeled and unlabeled/machine-labeled data by using the estimates from step (i). [sent-206, score-0.175]
</p><p>41 The idea of ASSVM is to make the best use of the labeled data, and to make the most use of the unlabeled data. [sent-207, score-0.175]
</p><p>42 Transductive SVM (TSVM) is an extension of SVM which takes advantage of both labeled and unlabeled data (Vapnik, 1998). [sent-208, score-0.175]

</p><p>48 Figure 2 shows the learning curve of different methods (in terms of accuracy) when the percentage of the labeled data (in the training set) ranges from 0 to 100%. [sent-312, score-0.108]
</p><p>49 ASSVM outperforms other methods, reaching its best performance of 88% accuracy when using ∼40% of the labeled data. [sent-313, score-0.144]
</p><p>50 Indeed when using i3n3g% ∼ o4f0 0th%e olafb tehleed l data, dit performs already equally  well as fully-supervised SVM using 100% of the labeled data. [sent-314, score-0.143]
</p><p>51 The advantage of ASSVM over ASVM (the second best method) is clear especially when 20-40% of the labeled data is used. [sent-315, score-0.108]
</p><p>52 SVM and TSVM tend to perform quite similarly with each other when more than 25% of the labeled data is used, but when less data is available, SVM performs better. [sent-316, score-0.108]
</p><p>53 Looking at the CRF-based methods, SSCRF outperforms CRF in particular when 10-25% of the labeled data is used. [sent-317, score-0.108]
</p><p>54 1, we employed in our  experiments a collection of features which had performed well in previous supervised AZ experiments. [sent-328, score-0.128]

</p><p>57 Voice is particularly important for CON, which differs from other categories in the sense that it is marked by frequent usage of active voice. [sent-419, score-0.24]
</p><p>58 5  Discussion  In our experiments, the majority of weaklysupervised methods outperformed their corresponding supervised methods when using just 10% of the labeled data. [sent-428, score-0.309]
</p><p>59 (2010) made a similar discovery when comparing fully supervised versions of SVM and CRF. [sent-431, score-0.122]
</p><p>60 Our best performing weakly-supervised methods were those based on active learning. [sent-432, score-0.204]
</p><p>61 Making a good use of both labeled and unlabeled data, active learning combined with self-training (ASSVM) proved to be the most useful method. [sent-433, score-0.433]
</p><p>62 Given 10% of the labeled data, ASSVM obtained an accuracy of 81% and  F-score of . [sent-434, score-0.144]
</p><p>63 It reached its top performance (88% accuracy) when using 40% of the labeled data, and performed equally well as fully supervised SVM (i. [sent-436, score-0.265]
</p><p>64 100% of the labeled data) when using just one third of the labeled data. [sent-438, score-0.216]
</p><p>65 This result is in line with the results of many other text classification works where active learning (alone or in combination with other techniques such as self-training) has proved similarly useful, e. [sent-439, score-0.295]
</p><p>66 While active learning iteratively explores the unknown aspects of the unlabeled data, semisupervised learning attempts to make the best use of what it already knows about the data. [sent-444, score-0.302]
</p><p>67 In our experiments, semi-supervised methods (TSVM and SSCRF) did not perform equally well as active learning TSVM even produced a lower accuracy than SVM with the same amount of labeled data although these methods have gained success in related works. [sent-445, score-0.383]
</p><p>68 (2006) employed a much larger data set than we did one including 5448 labeled instances (in 3 classes) and 5210-25 145 unlabeled instances. [sent-453, score-0.225]
</p><p>69 Given more labeled and unlabeled data per class we might be able to obtain better performance using SSCRF also on our task. [sent-454, score-0.175]
</p><p>70 However, given the high cost of obtaining labeled data methods not needing it are preferable. [sent-455, score-0.108]
</p><p>71 –  6  Conclusions and future work  Our experiments show that weakly-supervised learning can be used to identify AZ in scientific documents with good accuracy when only a limited amount of labeled data is available. [sent-456, score-0.292]
</p><p>72 Recently, some work has been done on the related task of classification of discourse relations in scientific texts: (Hernault et al. [sent-464, score-0.233]
</p><p>73 They obtained 30-60% accuracy on the RST Discourse Treebank (including 41 relation types) when using 100-10000 labeled and 100000 unlabeled instances. [sent-466, score-0.211]
</p><p>74 The accuracy was 20-60% when using the labeled data only. [sent-467, score-0.144]
</p><p>75 However, although related, the task of discourse relation classification differs substantially 280 from our task in that it focuses on local discourse relations while our task focuses on the global structure of the scientific document. [sent-468, score-0.281]
</p><p>76 First, the approach to active learning could be improved in various ways. [sent-470, score-0.204]
</p><p>77 The query strategy we employed (uncertainty sam-  pling) is a relatively straightforward method which only considers the best estimate for each unlabeled instance, disregarding other estimates that may contain useful information. [sent-471, score-0.117]
</p><p>78 , 2006) shows that Logistic Regression (LR) outperforms SVM when used with active learning, yielding higher F-score on the Reuters21578 data set (binary classification, 10,788 documents in total, 100 of them labeled). [sent-480, score-0.251]
</p><p>79 It would be interesting to explore whether supervised methods other than SVM are optimal for active learning when applied to our task. [sent-481, score-0.282]
</p><p>80 In addition, other combinations of weaklysupervised methods might be worth looking into, such as EM+active learning (McCallum and Nigam, 1998) and co-training+EM+active learning (Muslea et al. [sent-484, score-0.123]
</p><p>81 , 2002), which have proved promising in related text classification works. [sent-485, score-0.091]
</p><p>82 Our feature analysis showed that not all the features which had proved promising in fully supervised experiments were equally promising when applied to weakly-supervised learning from smaller data. [sent-487, score-0.211]
</p><p>83 One the key motivations for developing a weaklysupervised approach is to facilitate easy porting of schemes such as AZ to new tasks and domains. [sent-491, score-0.163]
</p><p>84 Re-  cent research shows that active learning in a target domain can leverage information from a different but related (source) domain (Rai et al. [sent-492, score-0.204]
</p><p>85 In the future, we plan to investigate the usefulness of weakly-supervised learning for identifying other schemes of information structure, e. [sent-498, score-0.081]
</p><p>86 , 2010), and not only in scientific abstracts but also in full journal papers which typically exemplify a larger set of scheme categories. [sent-504, score-0.263]

<p>Author: Chao Shen ; Tao Li</p><p>Abstract: In active dual supervision, not only informative examples but also features are selected for labeling to build a high quality classifier with low cost. However, how to measure the informativeness for both examples and feature on the same scale has not been well solved. In this paper, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization based approach to address this issue.

<p>Author: Florian Laws ; Christian Scheible ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: Supervised classification needs large amounts of annotated training data that is expensive to create. Two approaches that reduce the cost of annotation are active learning and crowdsourcing. However, these two approaches have not been combined successfully to date. We evaluate the utility of active learning in crowdsourcing on two tasks, named entity recognition and sentiment detection, and show that active learning outperforms random selection of annotation examples in a noisy crowdsourcing scenario.</p><p>5 0.062445335 <a title="12-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Hypotheses_Selection_Criteria_in_a_Reranking_Framework_for_Spoken_Language_Understanding.html">68 emnlp-2011-Hypotheses Selection Criteria in a Reranking Framework for Spoken Language Understanding</a></p>

Both large-scale in-domain data and small-scale document text are considered. We present a unified solution to include features derived from unlabeled data to a discriminative learning model. For the large-scale data, we derive string statistics from Gigaword to assist a character-based segmenter. In addition, we introduce the idea about transductive, document-level segmentation, which is designed to improve the system recall for out-ofvocabulary (OOV) words which appear more than once inside a document. Novel features1 result in relative error reductions of 13.8% and 15.4% in terms of F-score and the recall of OOV words respectively.</p><p>5 0.43284559 <a title="12-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Learning_Local_Content_Shift_Detectors_from_Document-level_Information.html">82 emnlp-2011-Learning Local Content Shift Detectors from Document-level Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Farkas</p><p>Abstract: Information-oriented document labeling is a special document multi-labeling task where the target labels refer to a specific information instead of the topic of the whole document. These kind oftasks are usually solved by looking up indicator phrases and analyzing their local context to filter false positive matches. Here, we introduce an approach for machine learning local content shifters which detects irrelevant local contexts using just the original document-level training labels. We handle content shifters in general, instead of learning a particular language phenomenon detector (e.g. negation or hedging) and form a single system for document labeling and content shift detection. Our empirical results achieved 24% error reduction compared to supervised baseline methods – on three document label– ing tasks.</p><p>6 0.40648836 <a title="12-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Active_Learning_with_Amazon_Mechanical_Turk.html">17 emnlp-2011-Active Learning with Amazon Mechanical Turk</a></p>

<p>Author: John DeNero ; Jakob Uszkoreit</p><p>Abstract: When translating among languages that differ substantially in word order, machine translation (MT) systems benefit from syntactic preordering—an approach that uses features from a syntactic parse to permute source words into a target-language-like order. This paper presents a method for inducing parse trees automatically from a parallel corpus, instead of using a supervised parser trained on a treebank. These induced parses are used to preorder source sentences. We demonstrate that our induced parser is effective: it not only improves a state-of-the-art phrase-based system with integrated reordering, but also approaches the performance of a recent preordering method based on a supervised parser. These results show that the syntactic structure which is relevant to MT pre-ordering can be learned automatically from parallel text, thus establishing a new application for unsupervised grammar induction.</p><p>2 0.91821969 <a title="12-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Fast_Re-scoring_Strategy_to_Capture_Long-Distance_Dependencies.html">5 emnlp-2011-A Fast Re-scoring Strategy to Capture Long-Distance Dependencies</a></p>
<p>Author: Anoop Deoras ; Tomas Mikolov ; Kenneth Church</p><p>Abstract: A re-scoring strategy is proposed that makes it feasible to capture more long-distance dependencies in the natural language. Two pass strategies have become popular in a number of recognition tasks such as ASR (automatic speech recognition), MT (machine translation) and OCR (optical character recognition). The first pass typically applies a weak language model (n-grams) to a lattice and the second pass applies a stronger language model to N best lists. The stronger language model is intended to capture more longdistance dependencies. The proposed method uses RNN-LM (recurrent neural network language model), which is a long span LM, to rescore word lattices in the second pass. A hill climbing method (iterative decoding) is proposed to search over islands of confusability in the word lattice. An evaluation based on Broadcast News shows speedups of 20 over basic N best re-scoring, and word error rate reduction of 8% (relative) on a highly competitive setup.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.81660491 <a title="12-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Weakly-supervised_Approach_to_Argumentative_Zoning_of_Scientific_Documents.html">12 emnlp-2011-A Weakly-supervised Approach to Argumentative Zoning of Scientific Documents</a></p>

The advantage of the proposed method comes from a more robust and efficient subsampling technique. The original multi-class language modeling problem is transformed into a set of binary problems where each binary classifier predicts whether or not a particular word will occur. We show that the binarized model is as powerful as the standard model and allows us to aggressively subsample negative training examples without sacrificing predictive performance.

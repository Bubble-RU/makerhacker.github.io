<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: We present a general learning-based approach for phrase-level sentiment analysis that adopts an ordinal sentiment scale and is explicitly compositional in nature. Thus, we can model the compositional effects required for accurate assignment of phrase-level sentiment. For example, combining an adverb (e.g., “very”) with a positive polar adjective (e.g., “good”) produces a phrase (“very good”) with increased polarity over the adjective alone. Inspired by recent work on distributional approaches to compositionality, we model each word as a matrix and combine words using iterated matrix multiplication, which allows for the modeling of both additive and multiplicative semantic effects. Although the multiplication-based matrix-space framework has been shown to be a theoretically elegant way to model composition (Rudolph and Giesbrecht, 2010), training such models has to be done carefully: the optimization is nonconvex and requires a good initial starting point. This paper presents the first such algorithm for learning a matrix-space model for semantic composition. In the context of the phrase-level sentiment analysis task, our experimental results show statistically significant improvements in performance over a bagof-words model.</p><p>3 0.2974354 <a title="33-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Predicting_Sentiment_Distributions.html">120 emnlp-2011-Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoders for Predicting Sentiment Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Jeffrey Pennington ; Eric H. Huang ; Andrew Y. Ng ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning framework based on recursive autoencoders for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label distributions. Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the model’s ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures emotional reactions. Our algorithm can more accurately predict distributions over such labels compared to several competitive baselines.</p><p>4 0.26882181 <a title="33-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Harnessing_WordNet_Senses_for_Supervised_Sentiment_Classification.html">63 emnlp-2011-Harnessing WordNet Senses for Supervised Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Balamurali AR ; Aditya Joshi ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to sentiment classification rely on lexical features, syntax-based features or a combination of the two. We propose semantic features using word senses for a supervised document-level sentiment classifier. To highlight the benefit of sense-based features, we compare word-based representation of documents with a sense-based representation where WordNet senses of the words are used as features. In addition, we highlight the benefit of senses by presenting a part-ofspeech-wise effect on sentiment classification. Finally, we show that even if a WSD engine disambiguates between a limited set of words in a document, a sentiment classifier still performs better than what it does in absence of sense annotation. Since word senses used as features show promise, we also examine the possibility of using similarity metrics defined on WordNet to address the problem of not finding a sense in the training corpus. We per- form experiments using three popular similarity metrics to mitigate the effect of unknown synsets in a test corpus by replacing them with similar synsets from the training corpus. The results show promising improvement with respect to the baseline.</p><p>5 0.22085492 <a title="33-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Identifying_and_Following_Expert_Investors_in_Stock_Microblogs.html">71 emnlp-2011-Identifying and Following Expert Investors in Stock Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Roy Bar-Haim ; Elad Dinur ; Ronen Feldman ; Moshe Fresko ; Guy Goldstein</p><p>Abstract: Information published in online stock investment message boards, and more recently in stock microblogs, is considered highly valuable by many investors. Previous work focused on aggregation of sentiment from all users. However, in this work we show that it is beneficial to distinguish expert users from non-experts. We propose a general framework for identifying expert investors, and use it as a basis for several models that predict stock rise from stock microblogging messages (stock tweets). In particular, we present two methods that combine expert identification and per-user unsupervised learning. These methods were shown to achieve relatively high precision in predicting stock rise, and significantly outperform our baseline. In addition, our work provides an in-depth analysis of the content and potential usefulness of stock tweets.</p><p>6 0.21697092 <a title="33-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Discriminating_Gender_on_Twitter.html">41 emnlp-2011-Discriminating Gender on Twitter</a></p>

<p>Author: Song Feng ; Ritwik Bose ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a connotation lexicon, a new type of lexicon that lists words with connotative polarity, i.e., words with positive connotation (e.g., award, promotion) and words with negative connotation (e.g., cancer, war). Connotation lexicons differ from much studied sentiment lexicons: the latter concerns words that express sentiment, while the former concerns words that evoke or associate with a specific polarity of sentiment. Understanding the connotation of words would seem to require common sense and world knowledge. However, we demonstrate that much of the connotative polarity of words can be inferred from natural language text in a nearly unsupervised manner. The key linguistic insight behind our approach is selectional preference of connotative predicates. We present graphbased algorithms using PageRank and HITS that collectively learn connotation lexicon together with connotative predicates. Our empirical study demonstrates that the resulting connotation lexicon is of great value for sentiment analysis complementing existing sentiment lexicons.</p><p>5 0.59532756 <a title="33-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Harnessing_WordNet_Senses_for_Supervised_Sentiment_Classification.html">63 emnlp-2011-Harnessing WordNet Senses for Supervised Sentiment Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhengxian Gong ; Min Zhang ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Statistical machine translation systems are usually trained on a large amount of bilingual sentence pairs and translate one sentence at a time, ignoring document-level information. In this paper, we propose a cache-based approach to document-level translation. Since caches mainly depend on relevant data to supervise subsequent decisions, it is critical to fill the caches with highly-relevant data of a reasonable size. In this paper, we present three kinds of caches to store relevant document-level information: 1) a dynamic cache, which stores bilingual phrase pairs from the best translation hypotheses of previous sentences in the test document; 2) a static cache, which stores relevant bilingual phrase pairs extracted from similar bilingual document pairs (i.e. source documents similar to the test document and their corresponding target documents) in the training parallel corpus; 3) a topic cache, which stores the target-side topic words related with the test document in the source-side. In particular, three new features are designed to explore various kinds of document-level information in above three kinds of caches. Evaluation shows the effectiveness of our cache-based approach to document-level translation with the performance improvement of 0.8 1 in BLUE score over Moses. Especially, detailed analysis and discussion are presented to give new insights to document-level translation. 1</p><p>3 0.66291684 <a title="33-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Correcting_Semantic_Collocation_Errors_with_L1-induced_Paraphrases.html">35 emnlp-2011-Correcting Semantic Collocation Errors with L1-induced Paraphrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for automatic collocation error correction in learner English which is based on paraphrases extracted from parallel corpora. Our key assumption is that collocation errors are often caused by semantic similarity in the first language (L1language) of the writer. An analysis of a large corpus of annotated learner English confirms this assumption. We evaluate our approach on real-world learner data and show that L1-induced paraphrases outperform traditional approaches based on edit distance, homophones, and WordNet synonyms.</p><p>4 0.64657909 <a title="33-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Discourse_Relations_for_Eliminating_Intra-sentence_Polarity_Ambiguities.html">142 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Discovery of Discourse Relations for Eliminating Intra-sentence Polarity Ambiguities</a></p>
<p>Author: Lanjun Zhou ; Binyang Li ; Wei Gao ; Zhongyu Wei ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Polarity classification of opinionated sentences with both positive and negative sentiments1 is a key challenge in sentiment analysis. This paper presents a novel unsupervised method for discovering intra-sentence level discourse relations for eliminating polarity ambiguities. Firstly, a discourse scheme with discourse constraints on polarity was defined empirically based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, a small set of cuephrase-based patterns were utilized to collect a large number of discourse instances which were later converted to semantic sequential representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsupervised method was adopted to generate, weigh and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for recognizing discourse relations. Experimental results showed that the proposed methods not only effectively recognized the defined discourse relations but also achieved significant improvement by integrating discourse information in sentence-level polarity classification.</p><p>5 0.64619106 <a title="33-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Compositional_Matrix-Space_Models_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">30 emnlp-2011-Compositional Matrix-Space Models for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: We present a general learning-based approach for phrase-level sentiment analysis that adopts an ordinal sentiment scale and is explicitly compositional in nature. Thus, we can model the compositional effects required for accurate assignment of phrase-level sentiment. For example, combining an adverb (e.g., “very”) with a positive polar adjective (e.g., “good”) produces a phrase (“very good”) with increased polarity over the adjective alone. Inspired by recent work on distributional approaches to compositionality, we model each word as a matrix and combine words using iterated matrix multiplication, which allows for the modeling of both additive and multiplicative semantic effects. Although the multiplication-based matrix-space framework has been shown to be a theoretically elegant way to model composition (Rudolph and Giesbrecht, 2010), training such models has to be done carefully: the optimization is nonconvex and requires a good initial starting point. This paper presents the first such algorithm for learning a matrix-space model for semantic composition. In the context of the phrase-level sentiment analysis task, our experimental results show statistically significant improvements in performance over a bagof-words model.</p><p>6 0.63900977 <a title="33-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Learning_General_Connotation_of_Words_using_Graph-based_Algorithms.html">81 emnlp-2011-Learning General Connotation of Words using Graph-based Algorithms</a></p>

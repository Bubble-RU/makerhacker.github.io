<p>Author: Fabio Massimo Zanzotto ; Marco Pennaccchiotti ; Kostas Tsioutsiouliklis</p><p>Abstract: In the last few years, the interest of the research community in micro-blogs and social media services, such as Twitter, is growing exponentially. Yet, so far not much attention has been paid on a key characteristic of microblogs: the high level of information redundancy. The aim of this paper is to systematically approach this problem by providing an operational definition of redundancy. We cast redundancy in the framework of Textual Entailment Recognition. We also provide quantitative evidence on the pervasiveness of redundancy in Twitter, and describe a dataset of redundancy-annotated tweets. Finally, we present a general purpose system for identifying redundant tweets. An extensive quantitative evaluation shows that our system successfully solves the redundancy detection task, improving over baseline systems with statistical significance.</p><p>3 0.45484552 <a title="41-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Tweets%3A_An_Experimental_Study.html">98 emnlp-2011-Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Sam Clark ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: People tweet more than 100 Million times daily, yielding a noisy, informal, but sometimes informative corpus of 140-character messages that mirrors the zeitgeist in an unprecedented manner. The performance of standard NLP tools is severely degraded on tweets. This paper addresses this issue by re-building the NLP pipeline beginning with part-of-speech tagging, through chunking, to named-entity recognition. Our novel T-NER system doubles F1 score compared with the Stanford NER system. T-NER leverages the redundancy inherent in tweets to achieve this performance, using LabeledLDA to exploit Freebase dictionaries as a source of distant supervision. LabeledLDA outperforms cotraining, increasing F1 by 25% over ten common entity types.

<p>Author: Roy Bar-Haim ; Elad Dinur ; Ronen Feldman ; Moshe Fresko ; Guy Goldstein</p><p>Abstract: Information published in online stock investment message boards, and more recently in stock microblogs, is considered highly valuable by many investors. Previous work focused on aggregation of sentiment from all users. However, in this work we show that it is beneficial to distinguish expert users from non-experts. We propose a general framework for identifying expert investors, and use it as a basis for several models that predict stock rise from stock microblogging messages (stock tweets). In particular, we present two methods that combine expert identification and per-user unsupervised learning. These methods were shown to achieve relatively high precision in predicting stock rise, and significantly outperform our baseline. In addition, our work provides an in-depth analysis of the content and potential usefulness of stock tweets.</p><p>5 0.31590527 <a title="41-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Rumor_has_it%3A_Identifying_Misinformation_in_Microblogs.html">117 emnlp-2011-Rumor has it: Identifying Misinformation in Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Vahed Qazvinian ; Emily Rosengren ; Dragomir R. Radev ; Qiaozhu Mei</p><p>Abstract: A rumor is commonly defined as a statement whose true value is unverifiable. Rumors may spread misinformation (false information) or disinformation (deliberately false information) on a network of people. Identifying rumors is crucial in online social media where large amounts of information are easily spread across a large network by sources with unverified authority. In this paper, we address the problem of rumor detection in microblogs and explore the effectiveness of 3 categories of features: content-based, network-based, and microblog-specific memes for correctly identifying rumors. Moreover, we show how these features are also effective in identifying disinformers, users who endorse a rumor and further help it to spread. We perform our experiments on more than 10,000 manually annotated tweets collected from Twitter and show how our retrieval model achieves more than 0.95 in Mean Average Precision (MAP). Fi- nally, we believe that our dataset is the first large-scale dataset on rumor detection. It can open new dimensions in analyzing online misinformation and other aspects of microblog conversations.</p><p>6 0.22865263 <a title="41-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Twitter_Catches_The_Flu%3A_Detecting_Influenza_Epidemics_using_Twitter.html">139 emnlp-2011-Twitter Catches The Flu: Detecting Influenza Epidemics using Twitter</a></p>

<p>Author: Eiji ARAMAKI ; Sachiko MASKAWA ; Mizuki MORITA</p><p>Abstract: Sachiko MASKAWA The University of Tokyo Tokyo, Japan s achi ko . mas kawa @ gma i . com l Mizuki MORITA National Institute of Biomedical Innovation Osaka, Japan mori ta . mi zuki @ gmai l com . posts more than 5.5 million messages (tweets) every day (reported by Twitter.com in March 201 1). With the recent rise in popularity and scale of social media, a growing need exists for systems that can extract useful information from huge amounts of data. We address the issue of detecting influenza epidemics. First, the proposed system extracts influenza related tweets using Twitter API. Then, only tweets that mention actual influenza patients are extracted by the support vector machine (SVM) based classifier. The experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach (0.89 correlation to the gold standard). Especially at the outbreak and early spread (early epidemic stage), the proposed method shows high correlation (0.97 correlation), which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. This paper describes that Twitter texts reflect the real world, and that NLP techniques can be applied to extract only tweets that contain useful information. 1</p><p>6 0.59363788 <a title="41-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Tweets%3A_An_Experimental_Study.html">98 emnlp-2011-Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study</a></p>

<p>Author: Ni Lao ; Tom Mitchell ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: t om . We consider the problem of performing learning and inference in a large scale knowledge base containing imperfect knowledge with incomplete coverage. We show that a soft inference procedure based on a combination of constrained, weighted, random walks through the knowledge base graph can be used to reliably infer new beliefs for the knowledge base. More specifically, we show that the system can learn to infer different target relations by tuning the weights associated with random walks that follow different paths through the graph, using a version of the Path Ranking Algorithm (Lao and Cohen, 2010b). We apply this approach to a knowledge base of approximately 500,000 beliefs extracted imperfectly from the web by NELL, a never-ending language learner (Carlson et al., 2010). This new system improves significantly over NELL’s earlier Horn-clause learning and inference method: it obtains nearly double the precision at rank 100, and the new learning method is also applicable to many more inference tasks.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.67836469 <a title="41-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Discriminating_Gender_on_Twitter.html">41 emnlp-2011-Discriminating Gender on Twitter</a></p>

These sentences may be selected with simple cross-entropy based methods, of which we present three. As these sentences are not themselves identical to the in-domain data, we call them pseudo in-domain subcorpora. These subcorpora 1% the size of the original can then used to train small domain-adapted Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems which outperform systems trained on the entire corpus. Performance is further improved when we use these domain-adapted models in combination with a true in-domain model. The results show that more training data is not always better, and that best results are attained via proper domain-relevant data selection, as well as combining in- and general-domain systems during decoding. – –</p><p>4 0.55787152 <a title="41-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Collaborative_Ranking%3A_A_Case_Study_on_Entity_Linking.html">29 emnlp-2011-Collaborative Ranking: A Case Study on Entity Linking</a></p>
<p>Author: Zheng Chen ; Heng Ji</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new ranking scheme, collaborative ranking (CR). In contrast to traditional non-collaborative ranking scheme which solely relies on the strengths of isolated queries and one stand-alone ranking algorithm, the new scheme integrates the strengths from multiple collaborators of a query and the strengths from multiple ranking algorithms. We elaborate three specific forms of collaborative ranking, namely, micro collaborative ranking (MiCR), macro collaborative ranking (MaCR) and micro-macro collab- orative ranking (MiMaCR). Experiments on entity linking task show that our proposed scheme is indeed effective and promising.</p><p>5 0.5374577 <a title="41-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Rumor_has_it%3A_Identifying_Misinformation_in_Microblogs.html">117 emnlp-2011-Rumor has it: Identifying Misinformation in Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Vahed Qazvinian ; Emily Rosengren ; Dragomir R. Radev ; Qiaozhu Mei</p><p>Abstract: A rumor is commonly defined as a statement whose true value is unverifiable. Rumors may spread misinformation (false information) or disinformation (deliberately false information) on a network of people. Identifying rumors is crucial in online social media where large amounts of information are easily spread across a large network by sources with unverified authority. In this paper, we address the problem of rumor detection in microblogs and explore the effectiveness of 3 categories of features: content-based, network-based, and microblog-specific memes for correctly identifying rumors. Moreover, we show how these features are also effective in identifying disinformers, users who endorse a rumor and further help it to spread. We perform our experiments on more than 10,000 manually annotated tweets collected from Twitter and show how our retrieval model achieves more than 0.95 in Mean Average Precision (MAP). Fi- nally, we believe that our dataset is the first large-scale dataset on rumor detection. It can open new dimensions in analyzing online misinformation and other aspects of microblog conversations.</p><p>6 0.52818561 <a title="41-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Probabilistic_models_of_similarity_in_syntactic_context.html">107 emnlp-2011-Probabilistic models of similarity in syntactic context</a></p>

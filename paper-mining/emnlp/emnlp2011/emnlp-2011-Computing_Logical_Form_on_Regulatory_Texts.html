<p>Author: Wei Lu ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a novel probabilistic approach for generating natural language sentences from their underlying semantics in the form of typed lambda calculus. The approach is built on top of a novel reduction-based weighted synchronous context free grammar formalism, which facilitates the transformation process from typed lambda calculus into natural language sentences. Sentences can then be generated based on such grammar rules with a log-linear model. To acquire such grammar rules automatically in an unsupervised manner, we also propose a novel approach with a generative model, which maps from sub-expressions of logical forms to word sequences in natural language sentences. Experiments on benchmark datasets for both English and Chinese generation tasks yield significant improvements over results obtained by two state-of-the-art machine translation models, in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluation.</p><p>3 0.049263526 <a title="32-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Lexical_Generalization_in_CCG_Grammar_Induction_for_Semantic_Parsing.html">87 emnlp-2011-Lexical Generalization in CCG Grammar Induction for Semantic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Kwiatkowski ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning factored probabilistic CCG grammars for semantic parsing from data containing sentences paired with logical-form meaning representations. Traditional CCG lexicons list lexical items that pair words and phrases with syntactic and semantic content. Such lexicons can be inefficient when words appear repeatedly with closely related lexical content. In this paper, we introduce factored lexicons, which include both lexemes to model word meaning and templates to model systematic variation in word usage. We also present an algorithm for learning factored CCG lexicons, along with a probabilistic parse-selection model. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach learns highly accurate parsers, whose generalization performance greatly from the lexical factoring. benefits</p><p>4 0.046636786 <a title="32-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Evaluating_Dependency_Parsing%3A_Robust_and_Heuristics-Free_Cross-Annotation_Evaluation.html">50 emnlp-2011-Evaluating Dependency Parsing: Robust and Heuristics-Free Cross-Annotation Evaluation</a></p>

We apply our method to train parsers that excel when used as part of a reordering component in a statistical machine translation system. We use a corpus of weakly-labeled reference reorderings to guide parser training. Our best parsers contribute significant improvements in subjective translation quality while their intrinsic attachment scores typically regress.</p><p>6 0.043213535 <a title="32-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Exploiting_Parse_Structures_for_Native_Language_Identification.html">54 emnlp-2011-Exploiting Parse Structures for Native Language Identification</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin Borschinger ; Bevan K. Jones ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: It is often assumed that ‘grounded’ learning tasks are beyond the scope of grammatical inference techniques. In this paper, we show that the grounded task of learning a semantic parser from ambiguous training data as discussed in Kim and Mooney (2010) can be reduced to a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar learning task in a way that gives state of the art results. We further show that additionally letting our model learn the language’s canonical word order improves its performance and leads to the highest semantic parsing f-scores previously reported in the literature.1</p><p>3 0.39161369 <a title="32-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Probabilistic_Forest-to-String_Model_for_Language_Generation_from_Typed_Lambda_Calculus_Expressions.html">10 emnlp-2011-A Probabilistic Forest-to-String Model for Language Generation from Typed Lambda Calculus Expressions</a></p>

<p>Author: Federico Sangati ; Willem Zuidema</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP). Like other DOP models, our parser utilizes syntactic fragments of arbitrary size from a treebank to analyze new sentences, but, crucially, it uses only those which are encountered at least twice. This criterion allows us to work with a relatively small but representative set of fragments, which can be employed as the symbolic backbone of several probabilistic generative models. For parsing we define a transform-backtransform approach that allows us to use standard PCFG technology, making our results easily replicable. According to standard Parseval metrics, our best model is on par with many state-ofthe-art parsers, while offering some complementary benefits: a simple generative probability model, and an explicit representation of the larger units of grammar.</p><p>6 0.33708054 <a title="32-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Learning_Local_Content_Shift_Detectors_from_Document-level_Information.html">82 emnlp-2011-Learning Local Content Shift Detectors from Document-level Information</a></p>

Current approaches to AZ rely on supervised machine learning (ML). – – Requiring large amounts of annotated data, these approaches are expensive to develop and port to different domains and tasks. A potential solution to this problem is to use weaklysupervised ML instead. We investigate the performance of four weakly-supervised classifiers on scientific abstract data annotated for multiple AZ classes. Our best classifier based on the combination of active learning and selftraining outperforms our best supervised classifier, yielding a high accuracy of 81% when using just 10% of the labeled data. This result suggests that weakly-supervised learning could be employed to improve the practical applicability and portability of AZ across different information access tasks.</p><p>3 0.53497469 <a title="32-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Multilayer_Sequence_Labeling.html">96 emnlp-2011-Multilayer Sequence Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Ai Azuma ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we describe a novel approach to cascaded learning and inference on sequences. We propose a weakly joint learning model on cascaded inference on sequences, called multilayer sequence labeling. In this model, inference on sequences is modeled as cascaded decision. However, the decision on a sequence labeling sequel to other decisions utilizes the features on the preceding results as marginalized by the probabilistic models on them. It is not novel itself, but our idea central to this paper is that the probabilistic models on succeeding labeling are viewed as indirectly depending on the probabilistic models on preceding analyses. We also propose two types of efficient dynamic programming which are required in the gradient-based optimization of an objective function. One of the dynamic programming algorithms resembles back propagation algorithm for mul- tilayer feed-forward neural networks. The other is a generalized version of the forwardbackward algorithm. We also report experiments of cascaded part-of-speech tagging and chunking of English sentences and show effectiveness of the proposed method.</p><p>4 0.47376257 <a title="32-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Soft_Dependency_Constraints_for_Reordering_in_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation.html">123 emnlp-2011-Soft Dependency Constraints for Reordering in Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Gao ; Philipp Koehn ; Alexandra Birch</p><p>Abstract: Long-distance reordering remains one of the biggest challenges facing machine translation. We derive soft constraints from the source dependency parsing to directly address the reordering problem for the hierarchical phrasebased model. Our approach significantly improves Chinese–English machine translation on a large-scale task by 0.84 BLEU points on average. Moreover, when we switch the tuning function from BLEU to the LRscore which promotes reordering, we observe total improvements of 1.21 BLEU, 1.30 LRscore and 3.36 TER over the baseline. On average our approach improves reordering precision and recall by 6.9 and 0.3 absolute points, respectively, and is found to be especially effective for long-distance reodering.</p><p>5 0.46914738 <a title="32-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Better_Evaluation_Metrics_Lead_to_Better_Machine_Translation.html">22 emnlp-2011-Better Evaluation Metrics Lead to Better Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Chang Liu ; Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Many machine translation evaluation metrics have been proposed after the seminal BLEU metric, and many among them have been found to consistently outperform BLEU, demonstrated by their better correlations with human judgment. It has long been the hope that by tuning machine translation systems against these new generation metrics, advances in automatic machine translation evaluation can lead directly to advances in automatic machine translation. However, to date there has been no unambiguous report that these new metrics can improve a state-of-theart machine translation system over its BLEUtuned baseline. In this paper, we demonstrate that tuning Joshua, a hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system, with the TESLA metrics results in significantly better humanjudged translation quality than the BLEUtuned baseline. TESLA-M in particular is simple and performs well in practice on large datasets. We release all our implementation under an open source license. It is our hope that this work will encourage the machine translation community to finally move away from BLEU as the unquestioned default and to consider the new generation metrics when tuning their systems.</p><p>6 0.4651382 <a title="32-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Corroborating_Text_Evaluation_Results_with_Heterogeneous_Measures.html">36 emnlp-2011-Corroborating Text Evaluation Results with Heterogeneous Measures</a></p>

<p>Author: Karthik Visweswariah ; Rajakrishnan Rajkumar ; Ankur Gandhe ; Ananthakrishnan Ramanathan ; Jiri Navratil</p><p>Abstract: Preordering of source side sentences has proved to be useful in improving statistical machine translation. Most work has used a parser in the source language along with rules to map the source language word order into the target language word order. The requirement to have a source language parser is a major drawback, which we seek to overcome in this paper. Instead of using a parser and then using rules to order the source side sentence we learn a model that can directly reorder source side sentences to match target word order using a small parallel corpus with highquality word alignments. Our model learns pairwise costs of a word immediately preced- ing another word. We use the Lin-Kernighan heuristic to find the best source reordering efficiently during training and testing and show that it suffices to provide good quality reordering. We show gains in translation performance based on our reordering model for translating from Hindi to English, Urdu to English (with a public dataset), and English to Hindi. For English to Hindi we show that our technique achieves better performance than a method that uses rules applied to the source side English parse.</p><p>4 0.23454958 <a title="123-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_novel_dependency-to-string_model_for_statistical_machine_translation.html">15 emnlp-2011-A novel dependency-to-string model for statistical machine translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Xie ; Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Dependency structure, as a first step towards semantics, is believed to be helpful to improve translation quality. However, previous works on dependency structure based models typically resort to insertion operations to complete translations, which make it difficult to specify ordering information in translation rules. In our model of this paper, we handle this problem by directly specifying the ordering information in head-dependents rules which represent the source side as head-dependents relations and the target side as strings. The head-dependents rules require only substitution operation, thus our model requires no heuristics or separate ordering models of the previous works to control the word order of translations. Large-scale experiments show that our model performs well on long distance reordering, and outperforms the state- of-the-art constituency-to-string model (+1.47 BLEU on average) and hierarchical phrasebased model (+0.46 BLEU on average) on two Chinese-English NIST test sets without resort to phrases or parse forest. For the first time, a source dependency structure based model catches up with and surpasses the state-of-theart translation models.</p><p>5 0.22528657 <a title="123-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Inducing_Sentence_Structure_from_Parallel_Corpora_for_Reordering.html">74 emnlp-2011-Inducing Sentence Structure from Parallel Corpora for Reordering</a></p>
<p>Author: John DeNero ; Jakob Uszkoreit</p><p>Abstract: When translating among languages that differ substantially in word order, machine translation (MT) systems benefit from syntactic preordering—an approach that uses features from a syntactic parse to permute source words into a target-language-like order. This paper presents a method for inducing parse trees automatically from a parallel corpus, instead of using a supervised parser trained on a treebank. These induced parses are used to preorder source sentences. We demonstrate that our induced parser is effective: it not only improves a state-of-the-art phrase-based system with integrated reordering, but also approaches the performance of a recent preordering method based on a supervised parser. These results show that the syntactic structure which is relevant to MT pre-ordering can be learned automatically from parallel text, thus establishing a new application for unsupervised grammar induction.</p><p>6 0.19901088 <a title="123-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous_Phrase_Dependency_Grammars_for_Machine_Translation.html">108 emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous Phrase Dependency Grammars for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ashequl Qadir ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: This research studies the text genre of message board forums, which contain a mixture of expository sentences that present factual information and conversational sentences that include communicative acts between the writer and readers. Our goal is to create sentence classifiers that can identify whether a sentence contains a speech act, and can recognize sentences containing four different speech act classes: Commissives, Directives, Expressives, and Representatives. We conduct experiments using a wide variety of features, including lexical and syntactic features, speech act word lists from external resources, and domain-specific semantic class features. We evaluate our results on a collection of message board posts in the domain of veterinary medicine.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.75100225 <a title="123-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Soft_Dependency_Constraints_for_Reordering_in_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation.html">123 emnlp-2011-Soft Dependency Constraints for Reordering in Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation</a></p>

Our approach significantly improves Chinese–English machine translation on a large-scale task by 0.84 BLEU points on average. Moreover, when we switch the tuning function from BLEU to the LRscore which promotes reordering, we observe total improvements of 1.21 BLEU, 1.30 LRscore and 3.36 TER over the baseline. On average our approach improves reordering precision and recall by 6.9 and 0.3 absolute points, respectively, and is found to be especially effective for long-distance reodering.</p><p>4 0.61012018 <a title="123-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Predicting_Thread_Discourse_Structure_over_Technical_Web_Forums.html">105 emnlp-2011-Predicting Thread Discourse Structure over Technical Web Forums</a></p>
<p>Author: Li Wang ; Marco Lui ; Su Nam Kim ; Joakim Nivre ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: Online discussion forums are a valuable means for users to resolve specific information needs, both interactively for the participants and statically for users who search/browse over historical thread data. However, the complex structure of forum threads can make it difficult for users to extract relevant information. The discourse structure of web forum threads, in the form of labelled dependency relationships between posts, has the potential to greatly improve information access over web forum archives. In this paper, we present the task of parsing user forum threads to determine the labelled dependencies between posts. Three methods, including a dependency parsing approach, are proposed to jointly classify the links (relationships) between posts and the dialogue act (type) of each link. The proposed methods significantly surpass an informed baseline. We also experiment with “in situ” classification of evolving threads, and establish that our best methods are able to perform equivalently well over partial threads as complete threads.</p><p>5 0.59911704 <a title="123-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Using_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Structural_Kernels_for_Classifying_Definition_Questions_in_Jeopardy%21.html">147 emnlp-2011-Using Syntactic and Semantic Structural Kernels for Classifying Definition Questions in Jeopardy!</a></p>
<p>Author: Alessandro Moschitti ; Jennifer Chu-carroll ; Siddharth Patwardhan ; James Fan ; Giuseppe Riccardi</p><p>Abstract: The last decade has seen many interesting applications of Question Answering (QA) technology. The Jeopardy! quiz show is certainly one of the most fascinating, from the viewpoints of both its broad domain and the complexity of its language. In this paper, we study kernel methods applied to syntactic/semantic structures for accurate classification of Jeopardy! definition questions. Our extensive empirical analysis shows that our classification models largely improve on classifiers based on word-language models. Such classifiers are also used in the state-of-the-art QA pipeline constituting Watson, the IBM Jeopardy! system. Our experiments measuring their impact on Watson show enhancements in QA accuracy and a consequent increase in the amount of money earned in game-based evaluation.</p><p>6 0.59273702 <a title="123-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Better_Evaluation_Metrics_Lead_to_Better_Machine_Translation.html">22 emnlp-2011-Better Evaluation Metrics Lead to Better Machine Translation</a></p>

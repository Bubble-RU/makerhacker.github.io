<p>Author: Weiwei Sun ; Jia Xu</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates improving supervised word segmentation accuracy with unlabeled data. Both large-scale in-domain data and small-scale document text are considered. We present a unified solution to include features derived from unlabeled data to a discriminative learning model. For the large-scale data, we derive string statistics from Gigaword to assist a character-based segmenter. In addition, we introduce the idea about transductive, document-level segmentation, which is designed to improve the system recall for out-ofvocabulary (OOV) words which appear more than once inside a document. Novel features1 result in relative error reductions of 13.8% and 15.4% in terms of F-score and the recall of OOV words respectively.</p><p>3 0.21031106 <a title="99-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Linear_Text_Segmentation_Using_Affinity_Propagation.html">88 emnlp-2011-Linear Text Segmentation Using Affinity Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Anna Kazantseva ; Stan Szpakowicz</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for linear text segmentation. It is an adaptation of Affinity Propagation, a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm in the framework of factor graphs. Affinity Propagation for Segmentation, or APS, receives a set of pairwise similarities between data points and produces segment boundaries and segment centres data points which best describe all other data points within the segment. APS iteratively passes messages in a cyclic factor graph, until convergence. Each iteration works with information on all available similarities, resulting in highquality results. APS scales linearly for realistic segmentation tasks. We derive the algorithm from the original Affinity Propagation formuâ€“ lation, and evaluate its performance on topical text segmentation in comparison with two state-of-the art segmenters. The results suggest that APS performs on par with or outperforms these two very competitive baselines.</p><p>4 0.17992932 <a title="99-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Splitting_Noun_Compounds_via_Monolingual_and_Bilingual_Paraphrasing%3A_A_Study_on_Japanese_Katakana_Words.html">124 emnlp-2011-Splitting Noun Compounds via Monolingual and Bilingual Paraphrasing: A Study on Japanese Katakana Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Nobuhiro Kaji ; Masaru Kitsuregawa</p><p>Abstract: Word boundaries within noun compounds are not marked by white spaces in a number of languages, unlike in English, and it is beneficial for various NLP applications to split such noun compounds. In the case of Japanese, noun compounds made up of katakana words (i.e., transliterated foreign words) are particularly difficult to split, because katakana words are highly productive and are often outof-vocabulary. To overcome this difficulty, we propose using monolingual and bilingual paraphrases of katakana noun compounds for identifying word boundaries. Experiments demonstrated that splitting accuracy is substantially improved by extracting such paraphrases from unlabeled textual data, the Web in our case, and then using that information for constructing splitting models.</p><p>5 0.17896074 <a title="99-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Bayesian_Mixture_Model_for_PoS_Induction_Using_Multiple_Features.html">1 emnlp-2011-A Bayesian Mixture Model for PoS Induction Using Multiple Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Christos Christodoulopoulos ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a fully unsupervised syntactic class induction system formulated as a Bayesian multinomial mixture model, where each word type is constrained to belong to a single class. By using a mixture model rather than a sequence model (e.g., HMM), we are able to easily add multiple kinds of features, including those at both the type level (morphology features) and token level (context and alignment features, the latter from parallel corpora). Using only context features, our system yields results comparable to state-of-the art, far better than a similar model without the one-class-per-type constraint. Using the additional features provides added benefit, and our final system outperforms the best published results on most of the 25 corpora tested.</p><p>6 0.16264346 <a title="99-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Universal_Morphological_Analysis_using_Structured_Nearest_Neighbor_Prediction.html">140 emnlp-2011-Universal Morphological Analysis using Structured Nearest Neighbor Prediction</a></p>

<p>Author: Young-Bum Kim ; Joao Graca ; Benjamin Snyder</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of unsupervised morphological analysis from a new angle. Past work has endeavored to design unsupervised learning methods which explicitly or implicitly encode inductive biases appropriate to the task at hand. We propose instead to treat morphological analysis as a structured prediction problem, where languages with labeled data serve as training examples for unlabeled languages, without the assumption of parallel data. We define a universal morphological feature space in which every language and its morphological analysis reside. We develop a novel structured nearest neighbor prediction method which seeks to find the morphological analysis for each unlabeled lan- guage which lies as close as possible in the feature space to a training language. We apply our model to eight inflecting languages, and induce nominal morphology with substantially higher accuracy than a traditional, MDLbased approach. Our analysis indicates that accuracy continues to improve substantially as the number of training languages increases.</p><p>6 0.42798609 <a title="99-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Bayesian_Mixture_Model_for_PoS_Induction_Using_Multiple_Features.html">1 emnlp-2011-A Bayesian Mixture Model for PoS Induction Using Multiple Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Jeffrey Pennington ; Eric H. Huang ; Andrew Y. Ng ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning framework based on recursive autoencoders for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label distributions. Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the modelâ€™s ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures emotional reactions. Our algorithm can more accurately predict distributions over such labels compared to several competitive baselines.</p><p>3 0.73169732 <a title="99-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Fast_Generation_of_Translation_Forest_for_Large-Scale_SMT_Discriminative_Training.html">58 emnlp-2011-Fast Generation of Translation Forest for Large-Scale SMT Discriminative Training</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Yang Liu ; Qun Liu ; Shouxun Lin</p><p>Abstract: Although discriminative training guarantees to improve statistical machine translation by incorporating a large amount of overlapping features, it is hard to scale up to large data due to decoding complexity. We propose a new algorithm to generate translation forest of training data in linear time with the help of word alignment. Our algorithm also alleviates the oracle selection problem by ensuring that a forest always contains derivations that exactly yield the reference translation. With millions of features trained on 519K sentences in 0.03 second per sentence, our system achieves significant improvement by 0.84 BLEU over the baseline system on the NIST Chinese-English test sets.</p><p>4 0.73162025 <a title="99-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Generating_Subsequent_Reference_in_Shared_Visual_Scenes%3A_Computation_vs_Re-Use.html">62 emnlp-2011-Generating Subsequent Reference in Shared Visual Scenes: Computation vs Re-Use</a></p>
<p>Author: Jette Viethen ; Robert Dale ; Markus Guhe</p><p>Abstract: Traditional computational approaches to referring expression generation operate in a deliberate manner, choosing the attributes to be included on the basis of their ability to distinguish the intended referent from its distractors. However, work in psycholinguistics suggests that speakers align their referring expressions with those used previously in the discourse, implying less deliberate choice and more subconscious reuse. This raises the question as to which is a more accurate characterisation of what people do. Using a corpus of dialogues containing 16,358 referring expressions, we explore this question via the generation of subsequent references in shared visual scenes. We use a machine learning approach to referring expression generation and demonstrate that incorporating features that correspond to the computational tradition does not match human referring behaviour as well as using features corresponding to the process of alignment. The results support the view that the traditional model of referring expression generation that is widely assumed in work on natural language generation may not in fact be correct; our analysis may also help explain the oft-observed redundancy found in humanproduced referring expressions.</p><p>5 0.73161691 <a title="99-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Learning_Sentential_Paraphrases_from_Bilingual_Parallel_Corpora_for_Text-to-Text_Generation.html">83 emnlp-2011-Learning Sentential Paraphrases from Bilingual Parallel Corpora for Text-to-Text Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Juri Ganitkevitch ; Chris Callison-Burch ; Courtney Napoles ; Benjamin Van Durme</p><p>Abstract: Previous work has shown that high quality phrasal paraphrases can be extracted from bilingual parallel corpora. However, it is not clear whether bitexts are an appropriate resource for extracting more sophisticated sentential paraphrases, which are more obviously learnable from monolingual parallel corpora. We extend bilingual paraphrase extraction to syntactic paraphrases and demonstrate its ability to learn a variety of general paraphrastic transformations, including passivization, dative shift, and topicalization. We discuss how our model can be adapted to many text generation tasks by augmenting its feature set, development data, and parameter estimation routine. We illustrate this adaptation by using our paraphrase model for the task of sentence compression and achieve results competitive with state-of-the-art compression systems.</p><p>6 0.73142368 <a title="99-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Generate_and_Rank_Approach_to_Sentence_Paraphrasing.html">6 emnlp-2011-A Generate and Rank Approach to Sentence Paraphrasing</a></p>

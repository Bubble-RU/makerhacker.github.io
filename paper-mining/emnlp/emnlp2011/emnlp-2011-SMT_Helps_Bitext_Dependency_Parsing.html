<p>Author: Wenbin Jiang ; Qun Liu ; Yajuan Lv</p><p>Abstract: We propose a relaxed correspondence assumption for cross-lingual projection of constituent syntax, which allows a supposed constituent of the target sentence to correspond to an unrestricted treelet in the source parse. Such a relaxed assumption fundamentally tolerates the syntactic non-isomorphism between languages, and enables us to learn the target-language-specific syntactic idiosyncrasy rather than a strained grammar directly projected from the source language syntax. Based on this assumption, a novel constituency projection method is also proposed in order to induce a projected constituent treebank from the source-parsed bilingual corpus. Experiments show that, the parser trained on the projected treebank dramatically outperforms previous projected and unsupervised parsers.</p><p>3 0.13000232 <a title="118-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Cache-based_Document-level_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">25 emnlp-2011-Cache-based Document-level Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengxian Gong ; Min Zhang ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Statistical machine translation systems are usually trained on a large amount of bilingual sentence pairs and translate one sentence at a time, ignoring document-level information. In this paper, we propose a cache-based approach to document-level translation. Since caches mainly depend on relevant data to supervise subsequent decisions, it is critical to fill the caches with highly-relevant data of a reasonable size. In this paper, we present three kinds of caches to store relevant document-level information: 1) a dynamic cache, which stores bilingual phrase pairs from the best translation hypotheses of previous sentences in the test document; 2) a static cache, which stores relevant bilingual phrase pairs extracted from similar bilingual document pairs (i.e. source documents similar to the test document and their corresponding target documents) in the training parallel corpus; 3) a topic cache, which stores the target-side topic words related with the test document in the source-side. In particular, three new features are designed to explore various kinds of document-level information in above three kinds of caches. Evaluation shows the effectiveness of our cache-based approach to document-level translation with the performance improvement of 0.8 1 in BLUE score over Moses. Especially, detailed analysis and discussion are presented to give new insights to document-level translation. 1</p><p>4 0.11027159 <a title="118-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Improving_Bilingual_Projections_via_Sparse_Covariance_Matrices.html">73 emnlp-2011-Improving Bilingual Projections via Sparse Covariance Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Raghavendra Udupa ; Hal Daume III ; Abhijit Bhole</p><p>Abstract: Mapping documents into an interlingual representation can help bridge the language barrier of cross-lingual corpora. Many existing approaches are based on word co-occurrences extracted from aligned training data, represented as a covariance matrix. In theory, such a covariance matrix should represent semantic equivalence, and should be highly sparse. Unfortunately, the presence of noise leads to dense covariance matrices which in turn leads to suboptimal document representations. In this paper, we explore techniques to recover the desired sparsity in covariance matrices in two ways. First, we explore word association measures and bilingual dictionaries to weigh the word pairs. Later, we explore different selection strategies to remove the noisy pairs based on the association scores. Our experimental results on the task of aligning comparable documents shows the efficacy of sparse covariance matrices on two data sets from two different language pairs.</p><p>5 0.099998429 <a title="118-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Joint_Models_for_Chinese_POS_Tagging_and_Dependency_Parsing.html">75 emnlp-2011-Joint Models for Chinese POS Tagging and Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenghua Li ; Min Zhang ; Wanxiang Che ; Ting Liu ; Wenliang Chen ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) is an indispensable feature in dependency parsing. Current research usually models POS tagging and dependency parsing independently. This may suffer from error propagation problem. Our experiments show that parsing accuracy drops by about 6% when using automatic POS tags instead of gold ones. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a solution by jointly optimizing POS tagging and dependency parsing in a unique model. We design several joint models and their corresponding decoding algorithms to incorporate different feature sets. We further present an effective pruning strategy to reduce the search space of candidate POS tags, leading to significant improvement of parsing speed. Experimental results on Chinese Penn Treebank 5 show that our joint models significantly improve the state-of-the-art parsing accuracy by about 1.5%. Detailed analysis shows that the joint method is able to choose such POS tags that are more helpful and discriminative from parsing viewpoint. This is the fundamental reason of parsing accuracy improvement.</p><p>6 0.098707557 <a title="118-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Training_a_Parser_for_Machine_Translation_Reordering.html">136 emnlp-2011-Training a Parser for Machine Translation Reordering</a></p>

<p>Author: Xabier Saralegi ; Iker Manterola ; Inaki San Vicente</p><p>Abstract: An A-C bilingual dictionary can be inferred by merging A-B and B-C dictionaries using B as pivot. However, polysemous pivot words often produce wrong translation candidates. This paper analyzes two methods for pruning wrong candidates: one based on exploiting the structure of the source dictionaries, and the other based on distributional similarity computed from comparable corpora. As both methods depend exclusively on easily available resources, they are well suited to less resourced languages. We studied whether these two techniques complement each other given that they are based on different paradigms. We also researched combining them by looking for the best adequacy depending on various application scenarios. ,</p><p>5 0.53790271 <a title="118-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Relaxed_Cross-lingual_Projection_of_Constituent_Syntax.html">115 emnlp-2011-Relaxed Cross-lingual Projection of Constituent Syntax</a></p>

The original multi-class language modeling problem is transformed into a set of binary problems where each binary classifier predicts whether or not a particular word will occur. We show that the binarized model is as powerful as the standard model and allows us to aggressively subsample negative training examples without sacrificing predictive performance. Empirical results show that we can train MELM and NNLM at 1% ∼ 5% of the strtaaninda MrdE complexity LwMith a no %los ∼s 5in% performance.</p><p>3 0.49387613 <a title="118-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Closing_the_Loop%3A_Fast%2C_Interactive_Semi-Supervised_Annotation_With_Queries_on_Features_and_Instances.html">28 emnlp-2011-Closing the Loop: Fast, Interactive Semi-Supervised Annotation With Queries on Features and Instances</a></p>
<p>Author: Burr Settles</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes DUALIST, an active learning annotation paradigm which solicits and learns from labels on both features (e.g., words) and instances (e.g., documents). We present a novel semi-supervised training algorithm developed for this setting, which is (1) fast enough to support real-time interactive speeds, and (2) at least as accurate as preexisting methods for learning with mixed feature and instance labels. Human annotators in user studies were able to produce near-stateof-the-art classifiers—on several corpora in a variety of application domains—with only a few minutes of effort.</p><p>4 0.49374211 <a title="118-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Fast_Generation_of_Translation_Forest_for_Large-Scale_SMT_Discriminative_Training.html">58 emnlp-2011-Fast Generation of Translation Forest for Large-Scale SMT Discriminative Training</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Yang Liu ; Qun Liu ; Shouxun Lin</p><p>Abstract: Although discriminative training guarantees to improve statistical machine translation by incorporating a large amount of overlapping features, it is hard to scale up to large data due to decoding complexity. We propose a new algorithm to generate translation forest of training data in linear time with the help of word alignment. Our algorithm also alleviates the oracle selection problem by ensuring that a forest always contains derivations that exactly yield the reference translation. With millions of features trained on 519K sentences in 0.03 second per sentence, our system achieves significant improvement by 0.84 BLEU over the baseline system on the NIST Chinese-English test sets.</p><p>5 0.49308515 <a title="118-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_novel_dependency-to-string_model_for_statistical_machine_translation.html">15 emnlp-2011-A novel dependency-to-string model for statistical machine translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Xie ; Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Dependency structure, as a first step towards semantics, is believed to be helpful to improve translation quality. However, previous works on dependency structure based models typically resort to insertion operations to complete translations, which make it difficult to specify ordering information in translation rules. In our model of this paper, we handle this problem by directly specifying the ordering information in head-dependents rules which represent the source side as head-dependents relations and the target side as strings. The head-dependents rules require only substitution operation, thus our model requires no heuristics or separate ordering models of the previous works to control the word order of translations. Large-scale experiments show that our model performs well on long distance reordering, and outperforms the state- of-the-art constituency-to-string model (+1.47 BLEU on average) and hierarchical phrasebased model (+0.46 BLEU on average) on two Chinese-English NIST test sets without resort to phrases or parse forest. For the first time, a source dependency structure based model catches up with and surpasses the state-of-theart translation models.</p><p>6 0.49306631 <a title="118-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Extreme_Extraction_-_Machine_Reading_in_a_Week.html">57 emnlp-2011-Extreme Extraction - Machine Reading in a Week</a></p>

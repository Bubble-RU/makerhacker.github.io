</p><p>5 1 Introduction Language models are an important component of current statistical machine translation systems. [sent-11, score-0.309]
</p><p>6 They affect the selection of phrase translation candidates and reordering choices by estimating the probability that an application of a phrase translation is a fluent continuation of the current translation hypothesis. [sent-12, score-0.756]
</p><p>7 The size and domain of the language model can have a significant impact on translation quality. [sent-13, score-0.192]
</p><p>8 (2007) have shown that each doubling of the training data from the news domain (used to build the language model), leads to improvements of approximately 0. [sent-15, score-0.298]
</p><p>9 On the other hand, 869 each doubling using general web data leads to improvements of approximately 0. [sent-17, score-0.298]
</p><p>10 While large n-gram language models do lead to improved translation quality, they still lack any generalization beyond the surface forms (Schwenk, 2007). [sent-19, score-0.369]
</p><p>11 Consider example (1), which is a short sentence fragment from the MT09 Arabic-English test set, with the corresponding machine translation output (1. [sent-20, score-0.274]
</p><p>12 b), from a phrase-based statistical machine  Ø¸  translation system, and reference translation (1. [sent-21, score-0.464]
</p><p>13 A straightforward approach to address this is to exploit the part-of-speech (POS) tags of the target words during translation (Kirchhoff and Yang, 2005). [sent-74, score-0.264]
</p><p>14 In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that builds and uses individual, local POS language models for each word in the vocabulary. [sent-84, score-0.302]
</p><p>15 Our experiments show that it leads to statistically significant improvements over a competitive baseline, using lexicalized reordering and a sizable 5-gram word language model, as well as a standard 7-gram POS language model approach. [sent-85, score-0.457]
</p><p>16 While word-based models estimate the probability of a string of m words by Equation 2, POS-based models estimate the probability of string of m POS tags by Equation 3. [sent-89, score-0.318]
</p><p>17 To deploy POS language models in machine translation, translation candidates need to be annotated with POS tags. [sent-100, score-0.309]
</p><p>18 For machine translation one can sum over all possible tag sequences, as in Equation 4. [sent-103, score-0.301]
</p><p>19 2 Effectiveness of POS Language Models Reported results on the effectiveness of POS language models for machine translation are mixed, in particular when translating into languages that are not morphologically rich, such as English. [sent-107, score-0.352]
</p><p>20 While they rarely seem to hurt translation quality, there does not seem to be a clear consensus that they significantly improve quality either. [sent-108, score-0.192]
</p><p>21 86 BLEU points for German-to-English translation for small training data. [sent-110, score-0.192]
</p><p>22 (2007) report improvements when comparing a supertag language  model to a baseline using a word language model only. [sent-114, score-0.251]
</p><p>23 Once the baseline incorporates lexicalized distortion (Tillmann, 2004; Koehn et al. [sent-115, score-0.262]
</p><p>24 Factored language models have not resulted in significant improvements either. [sent-117, score-0.261]
</p><p>25 Kirchhoff and Yang (2005) report slight improvements when re-ranking the n-best lists of their decoder, which word tri-grams. [sent-118, score-0.187]
</p><p>26 But these improvements are less than those gained by re-ranking the n-best lists with a 4-gram word language model. [sent-119, score-0.233]
</p><p>27 The impact of POS language models depends among other things on the size of the parallel corpus, the size and order of the word language model, and whether lexicalized distortion models are used. [sent-120, score-0.346]
</p><p>28 To gauge the potential effectiveness of POS language models without taking into consideration all these factors, we isolate the contribution of the language model by simulating machine translation output using English data only (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006; Post and Gildea, 2008). [sent-121, score-0.39]
</p><p>29 1 On the other hand, local language models alone (as introduced in Section 3) correlate with BLEU only slightly worse than surface models. [sent-133, score-0.361]
</p><p>30 The BLEU scores in Table 1 1Interpolating both models does not lead to further correlation improvements. [sent-135, score-0.176]
</p><p>31 These system-agnostic correlation results look promising for our local models and the endto-end translation results in Section 5 confirm these initial findings. [sent-142, score-0.552]
</p><p>32 Instead ofusing one global POS language model that is built by using all of a mono-lingual corpus in the target language, we build individual models, or local models, for each  word-POS pair using the POS tags surrounding each occurrence of that pair. [sent-144, score-0.354]
</p><p>33 The effect is that the resulting ngram probability distributions of each local model are more biased towards the contextual constraints of each individual word-POS pair. [sent-146, score-0.277]
</p><p>34 1 Definition of Local Language Models Each conditional probability of order n in a local model for the word-POS pair w :t is of the form:  pw:t(tn,pn|t1  :p1,  . [sent-149, score-0.277]
</p><p>35 The conditional local n-gram probabilities (a–d) are generated from the occurrence of the word told with POS tag VBD. [sent-154, score-0.386]
</p><p>36 For each local model we use a sliding window considering all n-grams of length n starting n words to the left and ending n words to the right of an occurrence of the word-POS pair of the model at hand. [sent-161, score-0.282]
</p><p>37 All local model probabilities are smoothed using Witten-Bell smoothing and interpolation. [sent-162, score-0.27]
</p><p>38 3 A local model of order n contains the conditional probabilities for words occurring at relative positions -1, +1, . [sent-165, score-0.273]
</p><p>39 Therefore the probability of a word occurrence is estimated by all local models covering this word’s position. [sent-169, score-0.405]
</p><p>40 , the probability of word wi+2 is based on the probability of the local model for wi+1, wi, wi−1, and wi−2 (the last two are not shown in Figure 2 for space reasons). [sent-173, score-0.326]
</p><p>41 , ti−2 : -2i)  nY−1 ·  Ypwi−n+j:ti−n+j(ti:n−j | Hi,n[j, ·])  (5)  Yj=0  2The smaller event space of local models often leads to incomplete counts-of-counts, preventing the use of Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1999). [sent-178, score-0.411]
</p><p>42 Figure 2: Schema of overlapping local language model applications. [sent-192, score-0.228]
</p><p>43 a Erixac shp row j ogf t Hi,n represents the history of the conditional probability belonging to the local model associated with position i −n+j. [sent-194, score-0.318]
</p><p>44 The example how tri-gram  in Figure 3 shows word-by-word  local language  models  are used to  compute the probability of a whole sentence. [sent-218, score-0.351]
</p><p>45 Our local language  model approach  also bears  some resemblance to statistical approaches to modeling  subcategorization  frames  (Manning,  1993). [sent-219, score-0.347]
</p><p>46 2 Building Local Language Models To build the local language models, we use the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), which is commonly applied in speech recognition and statistical machine translation. [sent-222, score-0.271]
</p><p>47 Often this is due to the computational (and implementational) complexities of integrating more complex language models with the decoder, although it is expected that a tighter integration with the decoder itself leads to better improvements than n-best list re-ranking. [sent-234, score-0.482]
</p><p>48 Integrating our local language modeling approach with a decoder is straightforward. [sent-235, score-0.362]
</p><p>49 Since SRILM supports arbitrarily many language models, local language models can be added using the same functionalities of SRILM’s API. [sent-237, score-0.302]
</p><p>50 For the experiments discussed in Section 4, we add about 150,000 local language models to the word model. [sent-238, score-0.302]
</p><p>51 All local language model probabilities are coupled with the same feature weight. [sent-239, score-0.228]
</p><p>52 Potentially, improvements could be gained from using separate weights for individual local models, but this would require an optimization procedure such as MIRA (Chiang et al. [sent-240, score-0.461]
</p><p>53 4 Experimental Setup Three approaches are compared in our experiments: the baseline system is a phrase-based statistical machine translation system (Koehn et al. [sent-245, score-0.299]
</p><p>54 The third approach represents the work described in this paper, extending the baseline by including 4-gram local language models. [sent-249, score-0.292]
</p><p>55 Only resources allowed under NIST’s constrained data conditions are used to train the language, translation, and lexicalized distortion models. [sent-252, score-0.198]
</p><p>56 To see whether our local language models result in improvements over a competitive baseline, we designed the baseline to use a large 5-gram word language model and lexicalized distortion modeling, both of which are known to cancel-out improve-  ments gained from POS language models (Birch et al. [sent-253, score-0.917]
</p><p>57 The 7-gram POS and 4-gram local language models were both trained on the POS tagged English side of the bitext and 10M sentences from Gigaword’s Xinhua and AFP sections. [sent-261, score-0.354]
</p><p>58 The data for building the translation models were primarily drawn from the parallel news resources distributed by the Linguistic Data Consor-  tium (LDC). [sent-262, score-0.266]
</p><p>59 , 2001), version 13a, where the brevity penalty is based on the reference translation with the closest length, and translation error rate (TER) version 0. [sent-279, score-0.461]
</p><p>60 To see whether the differences between the approaches we compared in our experiments are statistically significant, we apply approximate randomization (Noreen, 1989); Riezler and Maxwell (2005) have shown that approximate randomization is less sensitive to Type-I errors, i. [sent-285, score-0.178]
</p><p>61 Comparison of our approach (+locLM, rows 4a/b) to the baseline using a word language model (wordLM, rows 1a/b) and a competing approach using a POS-based language model (+posLM, rows 2a/b). [sent-293, score-0.427]
</p><p>62 Rows 3a/b show the relative improvements  over the baseline. [sent-303, score-0.187]
</p><p>63 The third approach  ‘+locLM’  (rows 4a/b) uses local language models in addition to the baseline’s word-based model. [sent-304, score-0.302]
</p><p>64 Rows 5a/b show the relative improvements of the local modeling approach over the baseline and rows 6a/b the improvements over the approach using a POS language model. [sent-306, score-0.852]
</p><p>65 The approach using a POS language model results in statistically significant improvements for only one test set (MT05) and the newswire documents of MT09. [sent-308, score-0.283]
</p><p>66 The average improvements across all sets and genres are negligible (+0. [sent-309, score-0.297]
</p><p>67 Our local language modeling approach achieves the highest BLEU scores for all test 875 sets and across all genres. [sent-311, score-0.293]
</p><p>68 With the exception of MT08-WB and MT09-WB all BLEU improvements over the baseline are statistically significant. [sent-314, score-0.297]
</p><p>69 When evaluating with 1-TER, local language modeling also achieves the best results, with the exception of MT06, where the POS language model  approach performs slightly better. [sent-315, score-0.293]
</p><p>70 Turning to the Chinese-English results in Table 3, we see similar improvements in BLEU. [sent-316, score-0.187]
</p><p>71 The improvements of using a POS language model are negligible (+0. [sent-317, score-0.253]
</p><p>72 Here as well, local language modeling leads to the best results, with substantial improvements of +0. [sent-319, score-0.547]
</p><p>73 The major difference between Arabic-English and Chinese-English is the discrepancy between BLEU score improvements and decreases in 1-TER. [sent-321, score-0.225]
</p><p>74 While we cannot explain this discrepancy, it is worth noting that similar discrepancies between BLEU and TER and Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English translation can be found in the literature. [sent-322, score-0.192]
</p><p>75 for Arabic-to-English on the MT06 and MT08 sets, but for Chinese-to-English the correlation seems to be much weaker and BLEU improvements of +0. [sent-328, score-0.245]
</p><p>76 One of the motivations of using POS language models in general, and local language models in our case, is to improve the fluency of translations, which should be reflected in increased precision for higherorder n-grams. [sent-331, score-0.376]
</p><p>77 Table 4 shows that this is the case when comparing local modeling to both word and POS language models for Arabic-to-English translation. [sent-332, score-0.367]
</p><p>78 ≤ The effectiveness of a POS language model often diminishes with improved translation quality of the base system to which it is added. [sent-345, score-0.284]
</p><p>79 Naturally, we are interested in the extent that this diminishing effect also holds for our local language mod876 els. [sent-346, score-0.228]
</p><p>80 Nevertheless, we can gauge this by taking a closer look at the distribution of improvements within our experiments. [sent-348, score-0.225]
</p><p>81 Figure 4 shows performance improvements in document-level BLEU for both language pairs. [sent-349, score-0.187]
</p><p>82 The document-level BLEU score for the baseline system is plotted on the x-axis and improvements are plotted on the y-axis. [sent-350, score-0.251]
</p><p>83 If the effectiveness of either added model (POS or local) diminishes with increasing translation quality, we would expect a declining regression line. [sent-352, score-0.335]
</p><p>84 Relative im-  provements for both added models increase as the translation quality of the baseline increases. [sent-354, score-0.33]
</p><p>85 The slope of both regression fits is almost identical, but the y-intercept is larger for our local modeling approach. [sent-355, score-0.417]
</p><p>86 Both models seem to help more for documents with lower baseline translation quality. [sent-358, score-0.33]
</p><p>87 For the local language model, the regression line intersects with the neutral line at about 40 BLEU, suggesting that until translation quality improves substantially, local language models could still have a positive impact. [sent-362, score-0.829]
</p><p>88 The work on factored language models (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003) is related to our work to the extent that it also mixes POS tags with lexical information, albeit in a very different manner. [sent-364, score-0.225]
</p><p>89 Kirchhoff and Yang (2005) applied factored language models to machine translation but the improvements were negligible. [sent-366, score-0.575]
</p><p>90 (2005) proposed a discriminative language modeling approach that uses mixtures of POS and surface information and showed that it leads to a reduction in speech recognition word er877  ror rates. [sent-368, score-0.191]
</p><p>91 On the other hand, their approach seems more suited for n-best list re-ranking and it is not clear whether those improvements carry over to machine translation. [sent-369, score-0.23]
</p><p>92 Li and Khudanpur (2008) adapted this discriminative approach to machine translation re-ranking but used surface forms only. [sent-370, score-0.294]
</p><p>93 7  Conclusion  Though POS language models do not lead to significant improvements over a competitive baseline, we have shown that a competitive phrase-based baseline system can benefit from using POS information by building lexically anchored local models. [sent-375, score-0.733]
</p><p>94 Our local model approach does not only lead to more contextspecific probability distributions, but also takes advantage of the language model probability of each word being based on all surrounding local models. [sent-376, score-0.598]
</p><p>95 The evaluations for Arabic- and Chinese-to-English show that local models lead to statistically significant improvements across different test sets and genres. [sent-377, score-0.579]
</p><p>96 Correlating the translation quality of the baseline with the improvements that result from adding local models, further suggests that these improvements are sustainable and should carry over to improved baseline systems. [sent-378, score-0.922]

<p>Author: Chang Liu ; Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: Many machine translation evaluation metrics have been proposed after the seminal BLEU metric, and many among them have been found to consistently outperform BLEU, demonstrated by their better correlations with human judgment. It has long been the hope that by tuning machine translation systems against these new generation metrics, advances in automatic machine translation evaluation can lead directly to advances in automatic machine translation. However, to date there has been no unambiguous report that these new metrics can improve a state-of-theart machine translation system over its BLEUtuned baseline. In this paper, we demonstrate that tuning Joshua, a hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system, with the TESLA metrics results in significantly better humanjudged translation quality than the BLEUtuned baseline. TESLA-M in particular is simple and performs well in practice on large datasets. We release all our implementation under an open source license. It is our hope that this work will encourage the machine translation community to finally move away from BLEU as the unquestioned default and to consider the new generation metrics when tuning their systems.</p><p>3 0.21194032 <a title="125-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Domain_Adaptation_via_Pseudo_In-Domain_Data_Selection.html">44 emnlp-2011-Domain Adaptation via Pseudo In-Domain Data Selection</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhenghua Li ; Min Zhang ; Wanxiang Che ; Ting Liu ; Wenliang Chen ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) is an indispensable feature in dependency parsing. Current research usually models POS tagging and dependency parsing independently. This may suffer from error propagation problem. Our experiments show that parsing accuracy drops by about 6% when using automatic POS tags instead of gold ones. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a solution by jointly optimizing POS tagging and dependency parsing in a unique model. We design several joint models and their corresponding decoding algorithms to incorporate different feature sets. We further present an effective pruning strategy to reduce the search space of candidate POS tags, leading to significant improvement of parsing speed. Experimental results on Chinese Penn Treebank 5 show that our joint models significantly improve the state-of-the-art parsing accuracy by about 1.5%. Detailed analysis shows that the joint method is able to choose such POS tags that are more helpful and discriminative from parsing viewpoint. This is the fundamental reason of parsing accuracy improvement.</p><p>5 0.17105059 <a title="125-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Soft_Dependency_Constraints_for_Reordering_in_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation.html">123 emnlp-2011-Soft Dependency Constraints for Reordering in Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation</a></p>

We argue that its limited effectiveness is due to the lack of lexicalization. We introduce a new approach that builds a separate local language model for each word and part-of-speech pair. The resulting models lead to more context-sensitive probability distributions and we also exploit the fact that different local models are used to estimate the language model probability of each word during decoding.

<p>Author: Enrique Amigo ; Julio Gonzalo ; Jesus Gimenez ; Felisa Verdejo</p><p>Abstract: Automatically produced texts (e.g. translations or summaries) are usually evaluated with n-gram based measures such as BLEU or ROUGE, while the wide set of more sophisticated measures that have been proposed in the last years remains largely ignored for practical purposes. In this paper we first present an indepth analysis of the state of the art in order to clarify this issue. After this, we formalize and verify empirically a set of properties that every text evaluation measure based on similarity to human-produced references satisfies. These properties imply that corroborating system improvements with additional measures always increases the overall reliability of the evaluation process. In addition, the greater the heterogeneity of the measures (which is measurable) the higher their combined reliability. These results support the use of heterogeneous measures in order to consolidate text evaluation results.</p><p>5 0.61769575 <a title="125-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Soft_Dependency_Constraints_for_Reordering_in_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation.html">123 emnlp-2011-Soft Dependency Constraints for Reordering in Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation</a></p>

However, polysemous pivot words often produce wrong translation candidates. This paper analyzes two methods for pruning wrong candidates: one based on exploiting the structure of the source dictionaries, and the other based on distributional similarity computed from comparable corpora. As both methods depend exclusively on easily available resources, they are well suited to less resourced languages. We studied whether these two techniques complement each other given that they are based on different paradigms. We also researched combining them by looking for the best adequacy depending on various application scenarios. ,</p><p>3 0.52465469 <a title="125-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Soft_Dependency_Constraints_for_Reordering_in_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation.html">123 emnlp-2011-Soft Dependency Constraints for Reordering in Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation</a></p>

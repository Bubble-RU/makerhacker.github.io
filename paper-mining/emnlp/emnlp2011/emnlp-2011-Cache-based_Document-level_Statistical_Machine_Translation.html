<p>Author: Wenliang Chen ; Jun'ichi Kazama ; Min Zhang ; Yoshimasa Tsuruoka ; Yujie Zhang ; Yiou Wang ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to improve the accuracy of parsing bilingual texts (bitexts) with the help of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. Previous bitext parsing methods use human-annotated bilingual treebanks that are hard to obtain. Instead, our approach uses an auto-generated bilingual treebank to produce bilingual constraints. However, because the auto-generated bilingual treebank contains errors, the bilingual constraints are noisy. To overcome this problem, we use large-scale unannotated data to verify the constraints and design a set of effective bilingual features for parsing models based on the verified results. The experimental results show that our new parsers significantly outperform state-of-theart baselines. Moreover, our approach is still able to provide improvement when we use a larger monolingual treebank that results in a much stronger baseline. Especially notable is that our approach can be used in a purely monolingual setting with the help of SMT.</p><p>4 0.10078141 <a title="25-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Language_Models_for_Machine_Translation%3A_Original_vs._Translated_Texts.html">76 emnlp-2011-Language Models for Machine Translation: Original vs. Translated Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Gennadi Lembersky ; Noam Ordan ; Shuly Wintner</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the differences between language models compiled from original target-language texts and those compiled from texts manually translated to the target language. Corroborating established observations of Translation Studies, we demonstrate that the latter are significantly better predictors of translated sentences than the former, and hence fit the reference set better. Furthermore, translated texts yield better language models for statistical machine translation than original texts.</p><p>5 0.09730725 <a title="25-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Local_Language_Models.html">125 emnlp-2011-Statistical Machine Translation with Local Language Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Christof Monz</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech language modeling is commonly used as a component in statistical machine translation systems, but there is mixed evidence that its usage leads to significant improvements. We argue that its limited effectiveness is due to the lack of lexicalization. We introduce a new approach that builds a separate local language model for each word and part-of-speech pair. The resulting models lead to more context-sensitive probability distributions and we also exploit the fact that different local models are used to estimate the language model probability of each word during decoding. Our approach is evaluated for Arabic- and Chinese-to-English translation. We show that it leads to statistically significant improvements for multiple test sets and also across different genres, when compared against a competitive baseline and a system using a part-of-speech model.</p><p>6 0.097065143 <a title="25-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous_Phrase_Dependency_Grammars_for_Machine_Translation.html">108 emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous Phrase Dependency Grammars for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Xabier Saralegi ; Iker Manterola ; Inaki San Vicente</p><p>Abstract: An A-C bilingual dictionary can be inferred by merging A-B and B-C dictionaries using B as pivot. However, polysemous pivot words often produce wrong translation candidates. This paper analyzes two methods for pruning wrong candidates: one based on exploiting the structure of the source dictionaries, and the other based on distributional similarity computed from comparable corpora. As both methods depend exclusively on easily available resources, they are well suited to less resourced languages. We studied whether these two techniques complement each other given that they are based on different paradigms. We also researched combining them by looking for the best adequacy depending on various application scenarios. ,</p><p>4 0.5942322 <a title="25-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Domain_Adaptation_via_Pseudo_In-Domain_Data_Selection.html">44 emnlp-2011-Domain Adaptation via Pseudo In-Domain Data Selection</a></p>

<p>Author: Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Raghavendra Udupa ; Hal Daume III ; Abhijit Bhole</p><p>Abstract: Mapping documents into an interlingual representation can help bridge the language barrier of cross-lingual corpora. Many existing approaches are based on word co-occurrences extracted from aligned training data, represented as a covariance matrix. In theory, such a covariance matrix should represent semantic equivalence, and should be highly sparse. Unfortunately, the presence of noise leads to dense covariance matrices which in turn leads to suboptimal document representations. In this paper, we explore techniques to recover the desired sparsity in covariance matrices in two ways. First, we explore word association measures and bilingual dictionaries to weigh the word pairs. Later, we explore different selection strategies to remove the noisy pairs based on the association scores. Our experimental results on the task of aligning comparable documents shows the efficacy of sparse covariance matrices on two data sets from two different language pairs.</p><p>6 0.50751096 <a title="25-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Language_Models_for_Machine_Translation%3A_Original_vs._Translated_Texts.html">76 emnlp-2011-Language Models for Machine Translation: Original vs. Translated Texts</a></p>

Using Word Lengthening to Detect Sentiment in Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel Brody ; Nicholas Diakopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method which leverages word lengthening to adapt a sentiment lexicon specifically for Twitter and similar social messaging networks. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we call attention to lengthening as a widespread phenomenon in microblogs and social messaging, and demonstrate the importance of handling it correctly. We then show that lengthening is strongly associated with subjectivity and sentiment. Finally, we present an automatic method which leverages this association to detect domain-specific sentiment- and emotionbearing words. We evaluate our method by comparison to human judgments, and analyze its strengths and weaknesses. Our results are of interest to anyone analyzing sentiment in microblogs and social networks, whether for research or commercial purposes.</p><p>3 0.61625832 <a title="25-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Random_Walk_Inference_and_Learning_in_A_Large_Scale_Knowledge_Base.html">109 emnlp-2011-Random Walk Inference and Learning in A Large Scale Knowledge Base</a></p>
<p>Author: Ni Lao ; Tom Mitchell ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: t om . We consider the problem of performing learning and inference in a large scale knowledge base containing imperfect knowledge with incomplete coverage. We show that a soft inference procedure based on a combination of constrained, weighted, random walks through the knowledge base graph can be used to reliably infer new beliefs for the knowledge base. More specifically, we show that the system can learn to infer different target relations by tuning the weights associated with random walks that follow different paths through the graph, using a version of the Path Ranking Algorithm (Lao and Cohen, 2010b). We apply this approach to a knowledge base of approximately 500,000 beliefs extracted imperfectly from the web by NELL, a never-ending language learner (Carlson et al., 2010). This new system improves significantly over NELL’s earlier Horn-clause learning and inference method: it obtains nearly double the precision at rank 100, and the new learning method is also applicable to many more inference tasks.</p><p>4 0.61013466 <a title="25-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Domain_Adaptation_via_Pseudo_In-Domain_Data_Selection.html">44 emnlp-2011-Domain Adaptation via Pseudo In-Domain Data Selection</a></p>

These sentences may be selected with simple cross-entropy based methods, of which we present three. As these sentences are not themselves identical to the in-domain data, we call them pseudo in-domain subcorpora. These subcorpora 1% the size of the original can then used to train small domain-adapted Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems which outperform systems trained on the entire corpus. Performance is further improved when we use these domain-adapted models in combination with a true in-domain model. The results show that more training data is not always better, and that best results are attained via proper domain-relevant data selection, as well as combining in- and general-domain systems during decoding. – –</p><p>5 0.6082862 <a title="25-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Discriminating_Gender_on_Twitter.html">41 emnlp-2011-Discriminating Gender on Twitter</a></p>
<p>Author: John D. Burger ; John Henderson ; George Kim ; Guido Zarrella</p><p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of demographic attributes from social media and other informal online content is valuable for marketing, personalization, and legal investigation. This paper describes the construction of a large, multilingual dataset labeled with gender, and investigates statistical models for determining the gender of uncharacterized Twitter users. We explore several different classifier types on this dataset. We show the degree to which classifier accuracy varies based on tweet volumes as well as when various kinds of profile metadata are included in the models. We also perform a large-scale human assessment using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our methods significantly out-perform both baseline models and almost all humans on the same task.</p><p>6 0.59335691 <a title="25-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Collaborative_Ranking%3A_A_Case_Study_on_Entity_Linking.html">29 emnlp-2011-Collaborative Ranking: A Case Study on Entity Linking</a></p>

<p>Author: Rui Yan ; Jian-Yun Nie ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Most traditional summarization methods treat their outputs as static and plain texts, which fail to capture user interests during summarization because the generated summaries are the same for different users. However, users have individual preferences on a particular source document collection and obviously a universal summary for all users might not always be satisfactory. Hence we investigate an important and challenging problem in summary generation, i.e., Interactive Personalized Summarization (IPS), which generates summaries in an interactive and personalized manner. Given the source documents, IPS captures user interests by enabling interactive clicks and incorporates personalization by modeling captured reader preference. We develop . experimental systems to compare 5 rival algorithms on 4 instinctively different datasets which amount to 5197 documents. Evaluation results in ROUGE metrics indicate the comparable performance between IPS and the best competing system but IPS produces summaries with much more user satisfaction according to evaluator ratings. Besides, low ROUGE consistency among these user preferred summaries indicates the existence of personalization.</p><p>3 0.11220372 <a title="135-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Generating_Aspect-oriented_Multi-Document_Summarization_with_Event-aspect_model.html">61 emnlp-2011-Generating Aspect-oriented Multi-Document Summarization with Event-aspect model</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Li ; Yinglin Wang ; Wei Gao ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatic generation of aspect-oriented summaries from multiple documents. We first develop an event-aspect LDA model to cluster sentences into aspects. We then use extended LexRank algorithm to rank the sentences in each cluster. We use Integer Linear Programming for sentence selection. Key features of our method include automatic grouping of semantically related sentences and sentence ranking based on extension of random walk model. Also, we implement a new sentence compression algorithm which use dependency tree instead of parser tree. We compare our method with four baseline methods. Quantitative evaluation based on Rouge metric demonstrates the effectiveness and advantages of our method.</p><p>4 0.079525925 <a title="135-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Syntax-Based_Grammaticality_Improvement_using_CCG_and_Guided_Search.html">132 emnlp-2011-Syntax-Based Grammaticality Improvement using CCG and Guided Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Zhang ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: Machine-produced text often lacks grammaticality and fluency. This paper studies grammaticality improvement using a syntax-based algorithm based on CCG. The goal of the search problem is to find an optimal parse tree among all that can be constructed through selection and ordering of the input words. The search problem, which is significantly harder than parsing, is solved by guided learning for best-first search. In a standard word ordering task, our system gives a BLEU score of 40. 1, higher than the previous result of 33.7 achieved by a dependency-based system.</p><p>5 0.078932621 <a title="135-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Ranking_Human_and_Machine_Summarization_Systems.html">110 emnlp-2011-Ranking Human and Machine Summarization Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Joel Lang ; Mirella Lapata</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a method for unsupervised semantic role induction which we formalize as a graph partitioning problem. Argument instances of a verb are represented as vertices in a graph whose edge weights quantify their role-semantic similarity. Graph partitioning is realized with an algorithm that iteratively assigns vertices to clusters based on the cluster assignments of neighboring vertices. Our method is algorithmically and conceptually simple, especially with respect to how problem-specific knowledge is incorporated into the model. Experimental results on the CoNLL 2008 benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model is competitive with other unsupervised approaches in terms of F1 whilst attaining significantly higher cluster purity.</p><p>4 0.57277209 <a title="135-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Linking_Entities_to_a_Knowledge_Base_with_Query_Expansion.html">90 emnlp-2011-Linking Entities to a Knowledge Base with Query Expansion</a></p>
<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to entity linking based on a statistical language model-based information retrieval with query expansion. We use both local contexts and global world knowledge to expand query language models. We place a strong emphasis on named entities in the local contexts and explore a positional language model to weigh them differently based on their distances to the query. Our experiments on the TAC-KBP 2010 data show that incorporating such contextual information indeed aids in disambiguating the named entities and consistently improves the entity linking performance. Compared with the official results from KBP 2010 participants, our system shows competitive performance.</p><p>5 0.56531346 <a title="135-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Data-Driven_Response_Generation_in_Social_Media.html">38 emnlp-2011-Data-Driven Response Generation in Social Media</a></p>

Cherry@ nrc-cnrc . gc . ca in Redmond, WA 98052 bi l ldol @mi cro so ft . com large corpus of status-response pairs found on Twitter to create a system that responds to Twitter status We present a data-driven approach to generating responses to Twitter status posts, based on phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation. We find that mapping conversational stimuli onto responses is more difficult than translating between languages, due to the wider range of possible responses, the larger fraction of unaligned words/phrases, and the presence of large phrase pairs whose alignment cannot be further decomposed. After addressing these challenges, we compare approaches based on SMT and Information Retrieval in a human evaluation. We show that SMT outperforms IR on this task, and its output is preferred over actual human responses in 15% of cases. As far as we are aware, this is the first work to investigate the use of phrase-based SMT to directly translate a linguistic stimulus into an appropriate response.</p><p>6 0.5643298 <a title="135-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Collaborative_Ranking%3A_A_Case_Study_on_Entity_Linking.html">29 emnlp-2011-Collaborative Ranking: A Case Study on Entity Linking</a></p>

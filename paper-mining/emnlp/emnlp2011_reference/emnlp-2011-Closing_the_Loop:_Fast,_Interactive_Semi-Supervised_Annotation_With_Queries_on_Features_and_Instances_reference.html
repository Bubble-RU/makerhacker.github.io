<h1>28 emnlp-2011-Closing the Loop: Fast, Interactive Semi-Supervised Annotation With Queries on Features and Instances</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-28-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1136.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Burr Settles</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes DUALIST, an active learning annotation paradigm which solicits and learns from labels on both features (e.g., words) and instances (e.g., documents). We present a novel semi-supervised training algorithm developed for this setting, which is (1) fast enough to support real-time interactive speeds, and (2) at least as accurate as preexisting methods for learning with mixed feature and instance labels. Human annotators in user studies were able to produce near-stateof-the-art classifiers—on several corpora in a variety of application domains—with only a few minutes of effort.</p><br/>

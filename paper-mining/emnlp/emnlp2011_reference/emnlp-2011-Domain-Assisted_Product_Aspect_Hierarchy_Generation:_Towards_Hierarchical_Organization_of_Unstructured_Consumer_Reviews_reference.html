<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-43-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1013.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Jianxing Yu ; Zheng-Jun Zha ; Meng Wang ; Kai Wang ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a domain-assisted approach to organize various aspects of a product into a hierarchy by integrating domain knowledge (e.g., the product specifications), as well as consumer reviews. Based on the derived hierarchy, we generate a hierarchical organization of consumer reviews on various product aspects and aggregate consumer opinions on these aspects. With such organization, user can easily grasp the overview of consumer reviews. Furthermore, we apply the hierarchy to the task of implicit aspect identification which aims to infer implicit aspects of the reviews that do not explicitly express those aspects but actually comment on them. The experimental results on 11popular products in four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p><br/>

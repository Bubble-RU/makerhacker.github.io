<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-30-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1016.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ainur Yessenalina ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: We present a general learning-based approach for phrase-level sentiment analysis that adopts an ordinal sentiment scale and is explicitly compositional in nature. Thus, we can model the compositional effects required for accurate assignment of phrase-level sentiment. For example, combining an adverb (e.g., “very”) with a positive polar adjective (e.g., “good”) produces a phrase (“very good”) with increased polarity over the adjective alone. Inspired by recent work on distributional approaches to compositionality, we model each word as a matrix and combine words using iterated matrix multiplication, which allows for the modeling of both additive and multiplicative semantic effects. Although the multiplication-based matrix-space framework has been shown to be a theoretically elegant way to model composition (Rudolph and Giesbrecht, 2010), training such models has to be done carefully: the optimization is nonconvex and requires a good initial starting point. This paper presents the first such algorithm for learning a matrix-space model for semantic composition. In the context of the phrase-level sentiment analysis task, our experimental results show statistically significant improvements in performance over a bagof-words model.</p><br/>

<h1>112 emnlp-2011-Refining the Notions of Depth and Density in WordNet-based Semantic Similarity Measures</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-112-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1093.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Tong Wang ; Graeme Hirst</p><p>Abstract: We re-investigate the rationale for and the effectiveness of adopting the notions of depth and density in WordNet-based semantic similarity measures. We show that the intuition for including these notions in WordNet-based similarity measures does not always stand up to empirical examination. In particular, the traditional definitions of depth and density as ordinal integer values in the hierarchical structure of WordNet does not always correlate with human judgment of lexical semantic similarity, which imposes strong limitations on their contribution to an accurate similarity measure. We thus propose several novel definitions of depth and density, which yield significant improvement in degree of correlation with similarity. When used in WordNet-based semantic similarity measures, the new definitions consistently improve performance on a task of correlating with human judgment.</p><br/>

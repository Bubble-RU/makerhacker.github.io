Our approach clusters candidate slot fillers to identify meaningful template slots. We propose a generative model that incorporates distributional prior knowledge to help distribute candidates in a document into appropriate slots. Empirical results suggest that the proposed prior can bring substantial improvements to our task as compared to a K-means baseline and a Gaussian mixture model baseline. Specifically, the proposed prior has shown to be effective when coupled with discriminative features of the candidates.</p><br/>

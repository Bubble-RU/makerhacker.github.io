<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-69-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1077.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Yulia Tsvetkov ; Shuly Wintner</p><p>Abstract: We propose an architecture for expressing various linguistically-motivated features that help identify multi-word expressions in natural language texts. The architecture combines various linguistically-motivated classification features in a Bayesian Network. We introduce novel ways for computing many of these features, and manually define linguistically-motivated interrelationships among them, which the Bayesian network models. Our methodology is almost entirely unsupervised and completely languageindependent; it relies on few language resources and is thus suitable for a large number of languages. Furthermore, unlike much recent work, our approach can identify expressions of various types and syntactic con- structions. We demonstrate a significant improvement in identification accuracy, compared with less sophisticated baselines.</p><br/>

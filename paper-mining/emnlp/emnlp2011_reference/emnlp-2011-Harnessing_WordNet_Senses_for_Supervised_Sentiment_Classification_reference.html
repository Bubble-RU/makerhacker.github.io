<h1>63 emnlp-2011-Harnessing WordNet Senses for Supervised Sentiment Classification</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-63-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1100.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Balamurali AR ; Aditya Joshi ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to sentiment classification rely on lexical features, syntax-based features or a combination of the two. We propose semantic features using word senses for a supervised document-level sentiment classifier. To highlight the benefit of sense-based features, we compare word-based representation of documents with a sense-based representation where WordNet senses of the words are used as features. In addition, we highlight the benefit of senses by presenting a part-ofspeech-wise effect on sentiment classification. Finally, we show that even if a WSD engine disambiguates between a limited set of words in a document, a sentiment classifier still performs better than what it does in absence of sense annotation. Since word senses used as features show promise, we also examine the possibility of using similarity metrics defined on WordNet to address the problem of not finding a sense in the training corpus. We per- form experiments using three popular similarity metrics to mitigate the effect of unknown synsets in a test corpus by replacing them with similar synsets from the training corpus. The results show promising improvement with respect to the baseline.</p><br/>

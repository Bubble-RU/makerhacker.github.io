<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-31-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1112.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Mark-Jan Nederhof ; Giorgio Satta</p><p>Abstract: The notion of infix probability has been introduced in the literature as a generalization of the notion of prefix (or initial substring) probability, motivated by applications in speech recognition and word error correction. For the case where a probabilistic context-free grammar is used as language model, methods for the computation of infix probabilities have been presented in the literature, based on various simplifying assumptions. Here we present a solution that applies to the problem in its full generality.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-89-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1061.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Fabio Massimo Zanzotto ; Marco Pennaccchiotti ; Kostas Tsioutsiouliklis</p><p>Abstract: In the last few years, the interest of the research community in micro-blogs and social media services, such as Twitter, is growing exponentially. Yet, so far not much attention has been paid on a key characteristic of microblogs: the high level of information redundancy. The aim of this paper is to systematically approach this problem by providing an operational definition of redundancy. We cast redundancy in the framework of Textual Entailment Recognition. We also provide quantitative evidence on the pervasiveness of redundancy in Twitter, and describe a dataset of redundancy-annotated tweets. Finally, we present a general purpose system for identifying redundant tweets. An extensive quantitative evaluation shows that our system successfully solves the redundancy detection task, improving over baseline systems with statistical significance.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-101-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1024.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: David Mimno ; Hanna Wallach ; Edmund Talley ; Miriam Leenders ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable models have the potential to add value to large document collections by discovering interpretable, low-dimensional subspaces. In order for people to use such models, however, they must trust them. Unfortunately, typical dimensionality reduction methods for text, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, often produce low-dimensional subspaces (topics) that are obviously flawed to human domain experts. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) An analysis of the ways in which topics can be flawed; (2) an automated evaluation metric for identifying such topics that does not rely on human annotators or reference collections outside the training data; (3) a novel statistical topic model based on this metric that significantly improves topic quality in a large-scale document collection from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p><br/>

<h1>128 emnlp-2011-Structured Relation Discovery using Generative Models</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-128-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1135.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Limin Yao ; Aria Haghighi ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We explore unsupervised approaches to relation extraction between two named entities; for instance, the semantic bornIn relation between a person and location entity. Concretely, we propose a series of generative probabilistic models, broadly similar to topic models, each which generates a corpus of observed triples of entity mention pairs and the surface syntactic dependency path between them. The output of each model is a clustering of observed relation tuples and their associated textual expressions to underlying semantic relation types. Our proposed models exploit entity type constraints within a relation as well as features on the dependency path between entity mentions. We examine effectiveness of our approach via multiple evaluations and demonstrate 12% error reduction in precision over a state-of-the-art weakly supervised baseline.</p><br/>

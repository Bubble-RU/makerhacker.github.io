<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-98-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1141.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Alan Ritter ; Sam Clark ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: People tweet more than 100 Million times daily, yielding a noisy, informal, but sometimes informative corpus of 140-character messages that mirrors the zeitgeist in an unprecedented manner. The performance of standard NLP tools is severely degraded on tweets. This paper addresses this issue by re-building the NLP pipeline beginning with part-of-speech tagging, through chunking, to named-entity recognition. Our novel T-NER system doubles F1 score compared with the Stanford NER system. T-NER leverages the redundancy inherent in tweets to achieve this performance, using LabeledLDA to exploit Freebase dictionaries as a source of distant supervision. LabeledLDA outperforms cotraining, increasing F1 by 25% over ten common entity types. Our NLP tools are available at: http : / / github .com/ aritt er /twitte r_nlp</p><br/>

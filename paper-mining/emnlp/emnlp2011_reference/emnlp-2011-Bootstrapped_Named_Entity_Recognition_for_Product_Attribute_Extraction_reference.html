<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-23-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1144.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Duangmanee Putthividhya ; Junling Hu</p><p>Abstract: We present a named entity recognition (NER) system for extracting product attributes and values from listing titles. Information extraction from short listing titles present a unique challenge, with the lack of informative context and grammatical structure. In this work, we combine supervised NER with bootstrapping to expand the seed list, and output normalized results. Focusing on listings from eBayâ€™s clothing and shoes categories, our bootstrapped NER system is able to identify new brands corresponding to spelling variants and typographical errors of the known brands, as well as identifying novel brands. Among the top 300 new brands predicted, our system achieves 90.33% precision. To output normalized attribute values, we explore several string comparison algorithms and found n-gram substring matching to work well in practice.</p><br/>

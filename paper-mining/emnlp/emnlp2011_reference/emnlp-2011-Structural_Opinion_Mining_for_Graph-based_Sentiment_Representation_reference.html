<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-126-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1123.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Yuanbin Wu ; Qi Zhang ; Xuanjing Huang ; Lide Wu</p><p>Abstract: Based on analysis of on-line review corpus we observe that most sentences have complicated opinion structures and they cannot be well represented by existing methods, such as frame-based and feature-based ones. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based representation for sentence level sentiment. An integer linear programming-based structural learning method is then introduced to produce the graph representations of input sentences. Experimental evaluations on a manually labeled Chinese corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><br/>

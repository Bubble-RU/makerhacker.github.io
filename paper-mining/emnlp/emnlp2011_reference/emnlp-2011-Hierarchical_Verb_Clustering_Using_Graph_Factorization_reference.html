<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-67-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1095.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Lin Sun ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: Most previous research on verb clustering has focussed on acquiring flat classifications from corpus data, although many manually built classifications are taxonomic in nature. Also Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications benefit from taxonomic classifications because they vary in terms of the granularity they require from a classification. We introduce a new clustering method called Hierarchical Graph Factorization Clustering (HGFC) and extend it so that it is optimal for the task. Our results show that HGFC outperforms the frequently used agglomerative clustering on a hierarchical test set extracted from VerbNet, and that it yields state-of-the-art performance also on a flat test set. We demonstrate how the method can be used to acquire novel classifications as well as to extend existing ones on the basis of some prior knowledge about the classification.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-80-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1094.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Tim Van de Cruys ; Thierry Poibeau ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for the computation of word meaning in context. We make use of a factorization model in which words, together with their window-based context words and their dependency relations, are linked to latent dimensions. The factorization model allows us to determine which dimensions are important for a particular context, and adapt the dependency-based feature vector of the word accordingly. The evaluation on a lexical substitution task carried out for both English and French – indicates that our approach is able to reach better results than state-of-the-art methods in lexical substitution, while at the same time providing more accurate meaning representations. –</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="emnlp-2011-88-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D11/D11-1026.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Anna Kazantseva ; Stan Szpakowicz</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for linear text segmentation. It is an adaptation of Affinity Propagation, a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm in the framework of factor graphs. Affinity Propagation for Segmentation, or APS, receives a set of pairwise similarities between data points and produces segment boundaries and segment centres data points which best describe all other data points within the segment. APS iteratively passes messages in a cyclic factor graph, until convergence. Each iteration works with information on all available similarities, resulting in highquality results. APS scales linearly for realistic segmentation tasks. We derive the algorithm from the original Affinity Propagation formuâ€“ lation, and evaluate its performance on topical text segmentation in comparison with two state-of-the art segmenters. The results suggest that APS performs on par with or outperforms these two very competitive baselines.</p><br/>

Amit Kumar, Christophe De_Vleeschouwer</p><p>Abstract: Given a set of plausible detections, detected at each time instant independently, we investigate how to associate them across time. This is done by propagating labels on a set of graphs that capture how the spatio-temporal and the appearance cues promote the assignment of identical or distinct labels to a pair of nodes. The graph construction is driven by the locally linear embedding (LLE) of either the spatio-temporal or the appearance features associated to the detections. Interestingly, the neighborhood of a node in each appearance graph is defined to include all nodes for which the appearance feature is available (except the ones that coexist at the same time). This allows to connect the nodes that share the same appearance even if they are temporally distant, which gives our framework the uncommon ability to exploit the appearance features that are available only sporadically along the sequence of detections. Once the graphs have been defined, the multi-object tracking is formulated as the problem of finding a label assignment that is consistent with the constraints captured by each of the graphs. This results into a difference of convex program that can be efficiently solved. Experiments are performed on a basketball and several well-known pedestrian datasets in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</p><br/>

Appendix 1 Our problem can be written as φ(Y ) = f(Y ) − g(Y )  ≤ f(Y ) −?g(Y(k)) + ∇g?(Y(k))(Y − Y(k))? = f(Y ) −? ∇g?(Y(k))Y − g(Y(k))  +∇g? (Y(k) )Y(k) :=  φˆ(Y, Y(k))  (5)  where the inequality in Equation 5 is due to the convexity of g(Y ). We can see that φ(Y ) ≤ φˆ(Y, Y(k)), ∀Y ∈ P with the equality holding only φw(Yhe )n ≤Y = Y(k) . I)n, ∀thYe l ∈ite Pra wtuireth, φˆ(Y, Y(k) ) is called the majorization of φ(Y ) [24]. The  solution  Y(k+1)  = argminφˆ(Y,Y(k))  follows the inequality φ(Y(k+1)) ≤ φˆ(Y(k+1),  Y ∈P Y(k)) ≤ φˆ(Y(k), Y(k))  (6) = φ(Y(k)),  where the first inequality and the last equality follow from Equation 5 and the second inequality follows from Equation 6. Therefore, above iterate in Equation 6 monotonically decreases φ(Y ). In order to solve the convex problem in Equation 6, we use the projected gradient method [13] as  where YPr(ol+j1 is) t=he P pr o j Pec?tiYon(l o)n−to β thl∇eφˆ p(rYob(al)b,ilYity(k s)i m?p,lex( P7,) awnhde rβel Pisr tohje i step s pirzeo.j eWcteio use a ofix thede step saibzieli tβyl where λmax is the largest eigenvalue of .

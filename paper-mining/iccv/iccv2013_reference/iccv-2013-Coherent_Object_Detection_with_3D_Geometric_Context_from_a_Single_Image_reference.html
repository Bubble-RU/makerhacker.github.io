<br/><p>Source: <a title="iccv-2013-79-pdf" href="http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2013/papers/Pan_Coherent_Object_Detection_2013_ICCV_paper.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Jiyan Pan, Takeo Kanade</p><p>Abstract: Objects in a real world image cannot have arbitrary appearance, sizes and locations due to geometric constraints in 3D space. Such a 3D geometric context plays an important role in resolving visual ambiguities and achieving coherent object detection. In this paper, we develop a RANSAC-CRF framework to detect objects that are geometrically coherent in the 3D world. Different from existing methods, we propose a novel generalized RANSAC algorithm to generate global 3D geometry hypothesesfrom local entities such that outlier suppression and noise reduction is achieved simultaneously. In addition, we evaluate those hypotheses using a CRF which considers both the compatibility of individual objects under global 3D geometric context and the compatibility between adjacent objects under local 3D geometric context. Experiment results show that our approach compares favorably with the state of the art.</p><br/>

Examples of our coherent object detection results. Solid green box: the object is detected by both the DPM detector and our algorithm. Solid red box: the object is missed by the DPM detector but recovered by our algorithm. Dotted red box: the object is detected by the DPM detector but rejected by our algorithm. Magenta line: gravity horizon. Yellow grid: ground plane where the grid spacing is 1m. The detection threshold of both the DPM detector and our algorithm is set as 0.5. We can see that some false detections from DPM are rejected due to inconsistency with global geometry (e.g. the huge ”pedestrian” in (a)); some false detections from DPM are rejected due to inconsistency with local geometry (e.g. the rejected ”cars” in (c)). Also, some true objects missed by DPM are recovered due to their geometric consistency (e.g. the pedestrians in (b)). The case when gravity direction and ground orientation do not agree is shown in (f), where the ground horizon is illustrated by the thick yellow line. It deviates from the gravity horizon. A failure case is shown in (k), where a ”car” is mistakenly recovered due to its high geometric compatibility. In another failure case shown in (l), two truncated cars are wrongly  rejected because our regressors are not trained on truncated cars.</p>

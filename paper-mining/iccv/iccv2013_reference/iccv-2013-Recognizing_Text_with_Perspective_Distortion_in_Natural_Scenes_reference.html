<br/><p>Source: <a title="iccv-2013-345-pdf" href="http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2013/papers/Phan_Recognizing_Text_with_2013_ICCV_paper.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Trung Quy Phan, Palaiahnakote Shivakumara, Shangxuan Tian, Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach to text recognition in natural scene images. Unlike most existing works which assume that texts are horizontal and frontal parallel to the image plane, our method is able to recognize perspective texts of arbitrary orientations. For individual character recognition, we adopt a bag-of-keypoints approach, in which Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptors are extracted densely and quantized using a pre-trained vocabulary. Following [1, 2], the context information is utilized through lexicons. We formulate word recognition as finding the optimal alignment between the set of characters and the list of lexicon words. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset called StreetViewText-Perspective, which contains texts in street images with a great variety of viewpoints. Experimental results on public datasets and the proposed dataset show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on perspective texts of arbitrary orientations.</p><br/>

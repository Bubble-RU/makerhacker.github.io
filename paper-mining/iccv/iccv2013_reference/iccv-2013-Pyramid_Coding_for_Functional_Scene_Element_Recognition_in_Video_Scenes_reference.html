Existing approaches have a limited ability to chharacterize elements such as cross-walks, intersections, andd buildings that have low activity, are multi-modal, or havee indirect evidence. Our approach recognizes the low activvity and multi-model elements (crosswalks/intersections) by introducing a hierarchy of descriptive clusters to fform a pyramid of codebooks that is sparse in the numbber of clusters and dense in content. The incorporation oof local behavioral context such as person-enter-building aand vehicle-parking nearby enables the detection of elemennts that do not have direct motion-based evidence, e.g. buuildings. These two contributions significantly improvee scene element recognition when compared against thhree state-of-the-art approaches. Results are shown on tyypical ground level surveillance video and for the first time on the more complex Wide Area Motion Imagery.</p><br/>

<p>Author: Feng Shi, Zhong Zhou, Jiangjian Xiao, Wei Wu</p><p>Abstract: Due to occlusions and objects ’ non-rigid deformation in the scene, the obtained motion trajectories from common trackers may contain a number of missing or mis-associated entries. To cluster such corrupted point based trajectories into multiple motions is still a hard problem. In this paper, we present an approach that exploits temporal and spatial characteristics from tracked points to facilitate segmentation of incomplete and corrupted trajectories, thereby obtain highly robust results against severe data missing and noises. Our method first uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) bases as a temporal smoothness constraint on trajectory projection to ensure the validity of resulting components to repair pathological trajectories. Then, based on an observation that the trajectories of foreground and background in a scene may have different spatial distributions, we propose a two-stage clustering strategy that first performs foreground-background separation then segments remaining foreground trajectories. We show that, with this new clustering strategy, sequences with complex motions can be accurately segmented by even using a simple trans- lational model. Finally, a series of experiments on Hopkins 155 dataset andBerkeley motion segmentation dataset show the advantage of our method over other state-of-the-art motion segmentation algorithms in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.</p><p>4 0.28444394 <a title="314-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Motion_Segmentation_Using_Dynamic_Label_Propagation.html">297 iccv-2013-Online Motion Segmentation Using Dynamic Label Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Elqursh, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: The vast majority of work on motion segmentation adopts the affine camera model due to its simplicity. Under the affine model, the motion segmentation problem becomes that of subspace separation. Due to this assumption, such methods are mainly offline and exhibit poor performance when the assumption is not satisfied. This is made evident in state-of-the-art methods that relax this assumption by using piecewise affine spaces and spectral clustering techniques to achieve better results. In this paper, we formulate the problem of motion segmentation as that of manifold separation. We then show how label propagation can be used in an online framework to achieve manifold separation. The performance of our framework is evaluated on a benchmark dataset and achieves competitive performance while being online.</p><p>5 0.26357234 <a title="314-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Subspace_Clustering_via_Half-Quadratic_Minimization.html">360 iccv-2013-Robust Subspace Clustering via Half-Quadratic Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yingya Zhang, Zhenan Sun, Ran He, Tieniu Tan</p><p>Abstract: Subspace clustering has important and wide applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. It is a challenging task to learn low-dimensional subspace structures due to the possible errors (e.g., noise and corruptions) existing in high-dimensional data. Recent subspace clustering methods usually assume a sparse representation of corrupted errors and correct the errors iteratively. However large corruptions in real-world applications can not be well addressed by these methods. A novel optimization model for robust subspace clustering is proposed in this paper. The objective function of our model mainly includes two parts. The first part aims to achieve a sparse representation of each high-dimensional data point with other data points. The second part aims to maximize the correntropy between a given data point and its low-dimensional representation with other points. Correntropy is a robust measure so that the influence of large corruptions on subspace clustering can be greatly suppressed. An extension of our method with explicit introduction of representation error terms into the model is also proposed. Half-quadratic minimization is provided as an efficient solution to the proposed robust subspace clustering formulations. Experimental results on Hopkins 155 dataset and Extended Yale Database B demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.</p><p>6 0.25056511 <a title="314-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Co-segmentation_for_Meaningful_Action_Extraction.html">439 iccv-2013-Video Co-segmentation for Meaningful Action Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jiashi Feng, Zhouchen Lin, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the subspace segmentation problem. Given a set of data points drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to partition them into their underlying subspaces they were drawn from. The spectral clustering method is used as the framework. It requires to find an affinity matrix which is close to block diagonal, with nonzero entries corresponding to the data point pairs from the same subspace. In this work, we argue that both sparsity and the grouping effect are important for subspace segmentation. A sparse affinity matrix tends to be block diagonal, with less connections between data points from different subspaces. The grouping effect ensures that the highly corrected data which are usually from the same subspace can be grouped together. Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), by using ?1-minimization, encourages sparsity for data selection, but it lacks of the grouping effect. On the contrary, Low-RankRepresentation (LRR), by rank minimization, and Least Squares Regression (LSR), by ?2-regularization, exhibit strong grouping effect, but they are short in subset selection. Thus the obtained affinity matrix is usually very sparse by SSC, yet very dense by LRR and LSR. In this work, we propose the Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation (CASS) method by using trace Lasso. CASS is a data correlation dependent method which simultaneously performs automatic data selection and groups correlated data together. It can be regarded as a method which adaptively balances SSC and LSR. Both theoretical and experimental results show the effectiveness of CASS.</p><p>3 0.80713946 <a title="314-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Space_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering.html">232 iccv-2013-Latent Space Sparse Subspace Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Choon-Meng Lee, Loong-Fah Cheong</p><p>Abstract: In contrast to the current motion segmentation paradigm that assumes independence between the motion subspaces, we approach the motion segmentation problem by seeking the parsimonious basis set that can represent the data. Our formulation explicitly looks for the overlap between subspaces in order to achieve a minimal basis representation. This parsimonious basis set is important for the performance of our model selection scheme because the sharing of basis results in savings of model complexity cost. We propose the use of affinity propagation based method to determine the number of motion. The key lies in the incorporation of a global cost model into the factor graph, serving the role of model complexity. The introduction of this global cost model requires additional message update in the factor graph. We derive an efficient update for the new messages associated with this global cost model. An important step in the use of affinity propagation is the subspace hypotheses generation. We use the row-sparse convex proxy solution as an initialization strategy. We further encourage the selection of subspace hypotheses with shared basis by integrat- ing a discount scheme that lowers the factor graph facility cost based on shared basis. We verified the model selection and classification performance of our proposed method on both the original Hopkins 155 dataset and the more balanced Hopkins 380 dataset.</p><p>6 0.74173015 <a title="314-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Distributed_Low-Rank_Subspace_Segmentation.html">122 iccv-2013-Distributed Low-Rank Subspace Segmentation</a></p>

Then, based on an observation that the trajectories of foreground and background in a scene may have different spatial distributions, we propose a two-stage clustering strategy that first performs foreground-background separation then segments remaining foreground trajectories. We show that, with this new clustering strategy, sequences with complex motions can be accurately segmented by even using a simple trans- lational model. Finally, a series of experiments on Hopkins 155 dataset andBerkeley motion segmentation dataset show the advantage of our method over other state-of-the-art motion segmentation algorithms in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.</p><p>3 0.71676248 <a title="314-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Locally_Affine_Sparse-to-Dense_Matching_for_Motion_and_Occlusion_Estimation.html">256 iccv-2013-Locally Affine Sparse-to-Dense Matching for Motion and Occlusion Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Marius Leordeanu, Andrei Zanfir, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Estimating a dense correspondence field between successive video frames, under large displacement, is important in many visual learning and recognition tasks. We propose a novel sparse-to-dense matching method for motion field estimation and occlusion detection. As an alternative to the current coarse-to-fine approaches from the optical flow literature, we start from the higher level of sparse matching with rich appearance and geometric constraints collected over extended neighborhoods, using an occlusion aware, locally affine model. Then, we move towards the simpler, but denser classic flow field model, with an interpolation procedure that offers a natural transition between the sparse and the dense correspondence fields. We experimentally demonstrate that our appearance features and our complex geometric constraintspermit the correct motion estimation even in difficult cases of large displacements and significant appearance changes. We also propose a novel classification method for occlusion detection that works in conjunction with the sparse-to-dense matching model. We validate our approach on the newly released Sintel dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results.</p><p>4 0.68145812 <a title="314-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Motion_for_Every_Visible_Point.html">441 iccv-2013-Video Motion for Every Visible Point</a></p>
<p>Author: Susanna Ricco, Carlo Tomasi</p><p>Abstract: Dense motion of image points over many video frames can provide important information about the world. However, occlusions and drift make it impossible to compute long motionpaths by merely concatenating opticalflow vectors between consecutive frames. Instead, we solve for entire paths directly, and flag the frames in which each is visible. As in previous work, we anchor each path to a unique pixel which guarantees an even spatial distribution of paths. Unlike earlier methods, we allow paths to be anchored in any frame. By explicitly requiring that at least one visible path passes within a small neighborhood of every pixel, we guarantee complete coverage of all visible points in all frames. We achieve state-of-the-art results on real sequences including both rigid and non-rigid motions with significant occlusions.</p><p>5 0.67931259 <a title="314-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Subspace_Stabilization_for_Stereoscopic_Video.html">226 iccv-2013-Joint Subspace Stabilization for Stereoscopic Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Feng Liu, Yuzhen Niu, Hailin Jin</p><p>Abstract: Shaky stereoscopic video is not only unpleasant to watch but may also cause 3D fatigue. Stabilizing the left and right view of a stereoscopic video separately using a monocular stabilization method tends to both introduce undesirable vertical disparities and damage horizontal disparities, which may destroy the stereoscopic viewing experience. In this paper, we present a joint subspace stabilization method for stereoscopic video. We prove that the low-rank subspace constraint for monocular video [10] also holds for stereoscopic video. Particularly, the feature trajectories from the left and right video share the same subspace. Based on this proof, we develop a stereo subspace stabilization method that jointly computes a common subspace from the left and right video and uses it to stabilize the two videos simultaneously. Our method meets the stereoscopic constraints without 3D reconstruction or explicit left-right correspondence. We test our method on a variety of stereoscopic videos with different scene content and camera motion. The experiments show that our method achieves high-quality stabilization for stereoscopic video in a robust and efficient way.</p><p>6 0.67896736 <a title="314-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>

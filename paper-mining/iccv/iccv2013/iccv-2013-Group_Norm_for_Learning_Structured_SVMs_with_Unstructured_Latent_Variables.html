<p>Author: Jianping Shi, Renjie Liao, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: We propose a co-detection and labeling (CoDeL) framework to identify persons that contain self-consistent appearance in multiple images. Our CoDeL model builds upon the deformable part-based model to detect human hypotheses and exploits cross-image correspondence via a matching classifier. Relying on a Gaussian process, this matching classifier models the similarity of two hypotheses and efficiently captures the relative importance contributed by various visual features, reducing the adverse effect of scattered occlusion. Further, the detector and matching classifier together make our modelfit into a semi-supervised co-training framework, which can get enhanced results with a small amount of labeled training data. Our CoDeL model achieves decent performance on existing and new benchmark datasets.</p><p>3 0.15558474 <a title="187-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Understanding_High-Level_Semantics_by_Modeling_Traffic_Patterns.html">433 iccv-2013-Understanding High-Level Semantics by Modeling Traffic Patterns</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongyi Zhang, Andreas Geiger, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in understanding the semantics of outdoor scenes in the context of autonomous driving. Towards this goal, we propose a generative model of 3D urban scenes which is able to reason not only about the geometry and objects present in the scene, but also about the high-level semantics in the form of traffic patterns. We found that a small number of patterns is sufficient to model the vast majority of traffic scenes and show how these patterns can be learned. As evidenced by our experiments, this high-level reasoning significantly improves the overall scene estimation as well as the vehicle-to-lane association when compared to state-of-the-art approaches [10].</p><p>4 0.15033934 <a title="187-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Training_Deformable_Part_Models_with_Decorrelated_Features.html">426 iccv-2013-Training Deformable Part Models with Decorrelated Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Ross Girshick, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we show how to train a deformable part model (DPM) fast—typically in less than 20 minutes, or four times faster than the current fastest method—while maintaining high average precision on the PASCAL VOC datasets. At the core of our approach is “latent LDA,” a novel generalization of linear discriminant analysis for learning latent variable models. Unlike latent SVM, latent LDA uses efficient closed-form updates and does not require an expensive search for hard negative examples. Our approach also acts as a springboard for a detailed experimental study of DPM training. We isolate and quantify the impact of key training factors for the first time (e.g., How important are discriminative SVM filters? How important is joint parameter estimation? How many negative images are needed for training?). Our findings yield useful insights for researchers working with Markov random fields and partbased models, and have practical implications for speeding up tasks such as model selection.</p><p>5 0.14327957 <a title="187-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Deformable_Part_Descriptors_for_Fine-Grained_Recognition_and_Attribute_Prediction.html">107 iccv-2013-Deformable Part Descriptors for Fine-Grained Recognition and Attribute Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Ning Zhang, Ryan Farrell, Forrest Iandola, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing objects in fine-grained domains can be extremely challenging due to the subtle differences between subcategories. Discriminative markings are often highly localized, leading traditional object recognition approaches to struggle with the large pose variation often present in these domains. Pose-normalization seeks to align training exemplars, either piecewise by part or globally for the whole object, effectively factoring out differences in pose and in viewing angle. Prior approaches relied on computationally-expensive filter ensembles for part localization and required extensive supervision. This paper proposes two pose-normalized descriptors based on computationally-efficient deformable part models. The first leverages the semantics inherent in strongly-supervised DPM parts. The second exploits weak semantic annotations to learn cross-component correspondences, computing pose-normalized descriptors from the latent parts of a weakly-supervised DPM. These representations enable pooling across pose and viewpoint, in turn facilitating tasks such as fine-grained recognition and attribute prediction. Experiments conducted on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset and Berkeley Human Attribute dataset demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-art algorithms.</p><p>6 0.14204018 <a title="187-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Structured_Model_Selection.html">130 iccv-2013-Dynamic Structured Model Selection</a></p>

<p>Author: Abhinav Shrivastava, Abhinav Gupta</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel part-based representation for modeling object categories. Our representation combines the effectiveness of deformable part-based models with the richness of geometric representation by defining parts based on consistent underlying 3D geometry. Our key hypothesis is that while the appearance and the arrangement of parts might vary across the instances of object categories, the constituent parts will still have consistent underlying 3D geometry. We propose to learn this geometrydriven deformable part-based model (gDPM) from a set of labeled RGBD images. We also demonstrate how the geometric representation of gDPM can help us leverage depth data during training and constrain the latent model learning problem. But most importantly, a joint geometric and appearance based representation not only allows us to achieve state-of-the-art results on object detection but also allows us to tackle the grand challenge of understanding 3D objects from 2D images.</p><p>4 0.73714697 <a title="187-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Shufflets%3A_Shared_Mid-level_Parts_for_Fast_Object_Detection.html">390 iccv-2013-Shufflets: Shared Mid-level Parts for Fast Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Iasonas Kokkinos</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to identify and exploit structures that are shared across different object categories, by using sparse coding to learn a shared basis for the ‘part’ and ‘root’ templates of Deformable Part Models (DPMs). Our first contribution consists in using Shift-Invariant Sparse Coding (SISC) to learn mid-level elements that can translate during coding. This results in systematically better approximations than those attained using standard sparse coding. To emphasize that the learned mid-level structures are shiftable we call them shufflets. Our second contribution consists in using the resulting score to construct probabilistic upper bounds to the exact template scores, instead of taking them ‘at face value ’ as is common in current works. We integrate shufflets in DualTree Branch-and-Bound and cascade-DPMs and demonstrate that we can achieve a substantial acceleration, with practically no loss in performance.</p><p>5 0.6884656 <a title="187-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Deformable_Part_Descriptors_for_Fine-Grained_Recognition_and_Attribute_Prediction.html">107 iccv-2013-Deformable Part Descriptors for Fine-Grained Recognition and Attribute Prediction</a></p>

<p>Author: Tal Hassner</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven method for estimating the 3D shapes of faces viewed in single, unconstrained photos (aka “in-the-wild”). Our method was designed with an emphasis on robustness and efficiency with the explicit goal of deployment in real-world applications which reconstruct and display faces in 3D. Our key observation is that for many practical applications, warping the shape of a reference face to match the appearance of a query, is enough to produce realistic impressions of the query ’s 3D shape. Doing so, however, requires matching visual features between the (possibly very different) query and reference images, while ensuring that a plausible face shape is produced. To this end, we describe an optimization process which seeks to maximize the similarity of appearances and depths, jointly, to those of a reference model. We describe our system for monocular face shape reconstruction and present both qualitative and quantitative experiments, comparing our method against alternative systems, and demonstrating its capabilities. Finally, as a testament to its suitability for real-world applications, we offer an open, online implementation of our system, providing unique means – of instant 3D viewing of faces appearing in web photos.</p><p>3 0.79269397 <a title="187-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Tree_Shape_Priors_with_Connectivity_Constraints_Using_Convex_Relaxation_on_General_Graphs.html">429 iccv-2013-Tree Shape Priors with Connectivity Constraints Using Convex Relaxation on General Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan Stühmer, Peter Schröder, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to include a connectivity prior into image segmentation that is based on a binary labeling of a directed graph, in this case a geodesic shortest path tree. Specifically we make two contributions: First, we construct a geodesic shortest path tree with a distance measure that is related to the image data and the bending energy of each path in the tree. Second, we include a connectivity prior in our segmentation model, that allows to segment not only a single elongated structure, but instead a whole connected branching tree. Because both our segmentation model and the connectivity constraint are convex, a global optimal solution can be found. To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure. To validate our method we present results on data from medical imaging in angiography and retinal blood vessel segmentation.</p><p>4 0.79030216 <a title="187-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Motion_for_Every_Visible_Point.html">441 iccv-2013-Video Motion for Every Visible Point</a></p>
<p>Author: Susanna Ricco, Carlo Tomasi</p><p>Abstract: Dense motion of image points over many video frames can provide important information about the world. However, occlusions and drift make it impossible to compute long motionpaths by merely concatenating opticalflow vectors between consecutive frames. Instead, we solve for entire paths directly, and flag the frames in which each is visible. As in previous work, we anchor each path to a unique pixel which guarantees an even spatial distribution of paths. Unlike earlier methods, we allow paths to be anchored in any frame. By explicitly requiring that at least one visible path passes within a small neighborhood of every pixel, we guarantee complete coverage of all visible points in all frames. We achieve state-of-the-art results on real sequences including both rigid and non-rigid motions with significant occlusions.</p><p>5 0.78951836 <a title="187-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-STAR3D%3A_Simultaneous_Tracking_and_Reconstruction_of_3D_Objects_Using_RGB-D_Data.html">366 iccv-2013-STAR3D: Simultaneous Tracking and Reconstruction of 3D Objects Using RGB-D Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Yuheng Ren, Victor Prisacariu, David Murray, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a probabilistic framework for simultaneous tracking and reconstruction of 3D rigid objects using an RGB-D camera. The tracking problem is handled using a bag-of-pixels representation and a back-projection scheme. Surface and background appearance models are learned online, leading to robust tracking in the presence of heavy occlusion and outliers. In both our tracking and reconstruction modules, the 3D object is implicitly embedded using a 3D level-set function. The framework is initialized with a simple shape primitive model (e.g. a sphere or a cube), and the real 3D object shape is tracked and reconstructed online. Unlike existing depth-based 3D reconstruction works, which either rely on calibrated/fixed camera set up or use the observed world map to track the depth camera, our framework can simultaneously track and reconstruct small moving objects. We use both qualitative and quantitative results to demonstrate the superior performance of both tracking and reconstruction of our method.</p><p>6 0.78924048 <a title="187-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Content-Aware_Rotation.html">90 iccv-2013-Content-Aware Rotation</a></p>

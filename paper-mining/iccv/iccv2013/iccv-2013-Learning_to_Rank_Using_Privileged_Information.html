<p>Author: Xudong Cao, David Wipf, Fang Wen, Genquan Duan, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: Face verification involves determining whether a pair of facial images belongs to the same or different subjects. This problem can prove to be quite challenging in many important applications where labeled training data is scarce, e.g., family album photo organization software. Herein we propose a principled transfer learning approach for merging plentiful source-domain data with limited samples from some target domain of interest to create a classifier that ideally performs nearly as well as if rich target-domain data were present. Based upon a surprisingly simple generative Bayesian model, our approach combines a KL-divergencebased regularizer/prior with a robust likelihood function leading to a scalable implementation via the EM algorithm. As justification for our design choices, we later use principles from convex analysis to recast our algorithm as an equivalent structured rank minimization problem leading to a number of interesting insights related to solution structure and feature-transform invariance. These insights help to both explain the effectiveness of our algorithm as well as elucidate a wide variety of related Bayesian approaches. Experimental testing with challenging datasets validate the utility of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>3 0.086442739 <a title="248-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Adaptation_for_Personalized_Image_Search.html">52 iccv-2013-Attribute Adaptation for Personalized Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Adriana Kovashka, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: Current methods learn monolithic attribute predictors, with the assumption that a single model is sufficient to reflect human understanding of a visual attribute. However, in reality, humans vary in how they perceive the association between a named property and image content. For example, two people may have slightly different internal models for what makes a shoe look “formal”, or they may disagree on which of two scenes looks “more cluttered”. Rather than discount these differences as noise, we propose to learn user-specific attribute models. We adapt a generic model trained with annotations from multiple users, tailoring it to satisfy user-specific labels. Furthermore, we propose novel techniques to infer user-specific labels based on transitivity and contradictions in the user’s search history. We demonstrate that adapted attributes improve accuracy over both existing monolithic models as well as models that learn from scratch with user-specific data alone. In addition, we show how adapted attributes are useful to personalize image search, whether with binary or relative attributes.</p><p>4 0.071989812 <a title="248-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_Unified_Probabilistic_Approach_Modeling_Relationships_between_Attributes_and_Objects.html">31 iccv-2013-A Unified Probabilistic Approach Modeling Relationships between Attributes and Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoyang Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a unified probabilistic model to model the relationships between attributes and objects for attribute prediction and object recognition. As a list of semantically meaningful properties of objects, attributes generally relate to each other statistically. In this paper, we propose a unified probabilistic model to automatically discover and capture both the object-dependent and objectindependent attribute relationships. The model utilizes the captured relationships to benefit both attribute prediction and object recognition. Experiments on four benchmark attribute datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed unified model for improving attribute prediction as well as object recognition in both standard and zero-shot learning cases.</p><p>5 0.070723787 <a title="248-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Hierarchical_Joint_Max-Margin_Learning_of_Mid_and_Top_Level_Representations_for_Visual_Recognition.html">197 iccv-2013-Hierarchical Joint Max-Margin Learning of Mid and Top Level Representations for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Hans Lobel, René Vidal, Alvaro Soto</p><p>Abstract: Currently, Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) and part-based methods are the most popular approaches for visual recognition. In both cases, a mid-level representation is built on top of low-level image descriptors and top-level classifiers use this mid-level representation to achieve visual recognition. While in current part-based approaches, mid- and top-level representations are usually jointly trained, this is not the usual case for BoVW schemes. A main reason for this is the complex data association problem related to the usual large dictionary size needed by BoVW approaches. As a further observation, typical solutions based on BoVW and part-based representations are usually limited to extensions of binary classification schemes, a strategy that ignores relevant correlations among classes. In this work we propose a novel hierarchical approach to visual recognition based on a BoVW scheme that jointly learns suitable midand top-level representations. Furthermore, using a maxmargin learning framework, the proposed approach directly handles the multiclass case at both levels of abstraction. We test our proposed method using several popular bench- mark datasets. As our main result, we demonstrate that, by coupling learning of mid- and top-level representations, the proposed approach fosters sharing of discriminative visual words among target classes, being able to achieve state-ofthe-art recognition performance using far less visual words than previous approaches.</p><p>6 0.062391125 <a title="248-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic_Transform%3A_Weakly_Supervised_Semantic_Inference_for_Relating_Visual_Attributes.html">380 iccv-2013-Semantic Transform: Weakly Supervised Semantic Inference for Relating Visual Attributes</a></p>

<p>Author: Devi Parikh, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: User feedback helps an image search system refine its relevance predictions, tailoring the search towards the user’s preferences. Existing methods simply take feedback at face value: clicking on an image means the user wants things like it; commenting that an image lacks a specific attribute means the user wants things that have it. However, we expect there is actually more information behind the user’s literal feedback. In particular, a user’s (possibly subconscious) search strategy leads him to comment on certain images rather than others, based on how any of the visible candidate images compare to the desired content. For example, he may be more likely to give negative feedback on an irrelevant image that is relatively close to his target, as opposed to bothering with one that is altogether different. We introduce novel features to capitalize on such implied feedback cues, and learn a ranking function that uses them to improve the system’s relevance estimates. We validate the approach with real users searching for shoes, faces, or scenes using two different modes of feedback: binary relevance feedback and relative attributes-based feedback. The results show that retrieval improves significantly when the system accounts for the learned behaviors. We show that the nuances learned are domain-invariant, and useful for both generic user-independent search as well as personalized user-specific search.</p><p>3 0.7062009 <a title="248-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Unbiased_Metric_Learning%3A_On_the_Utilization_of_Multiple_Datasets_and_Web_Images_for_Softening_Bias.html">431 iccv-2013-Unbiased Metric Learning: On the Utilization of Multiple Datasets and Web Images for Softening Bias</a></p>
<p>Author: Chen Fang, Ye Xu, Daniel N. Rockmore</p><p>Abstract: Many standard computer vision datasets exhibit biases due to a variety of sources including illumination condition, imaging system, and preference of dataset collectors. Biases like these can have downstream effects in the use of vision datasets in the construction of generalizable techniques, especially for the goal of the creation of a classification system capable of generalizing to unseen and novel datasets. In this work we propose Unbiased Metric Learning (UML), a metric learning approach, to achieve this goal. UML operates in the following two steps: (1) By varying hyperparameters, it learns a set of less biased candidate distance metrics on training examples from multiple biased datasets. The key idea is to learn a neighborhood for each example, which consists of not only examples of the same category from the same dataset, but those from other datasets. The learning framework is based on structural SVM. (2) We do model validation on a set of weakly-labeled web images retrieved by issuing class labels as keywords to search engine. The metric with best validationperformance is selected. Although the web images sometimes have noisy labels, they often tend to be less biased, which makes them suitable for the validation set in our task. Cross-dataset image classification experiments are carried out. Results show significant performance improvement on four well-known computer vision datasets.</p><p>4 0.69919306 <a title="248-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Quadruplet-Wise_Image_Similarity_Learning.html">332 iccv-2013-Quadruplet-Wise Image Similarity Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc T. Law, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel similarity learning framework. Working with inequality constraints involving quadruplets of images, our approach aims at efficiently modeling similarity from rich or complex semantic label relationships. From these quadruplet-wise constraints, we propose a similarity learning framework relying on a convex optimization scheme. We then study how our metric learning scheme can exploit specific class relationships, such as class ranking (relative attributes), and class taxonomy. We show that classification using the learned metrics gets improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on several datasets. We also evaluate our approach in a new application to learn similarities between webpage screenshots in a fully unsupervised way.</p><p>5 0.672858 <a title="248-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Pivots_for_Guiding_Relevance_Feedback_in_Image_Search.html">54 iccv-2013-Attribute Pivots for Guiding Relevance Feedback in Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Adriana Kovashka, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: In interactive image search, a user iteratively refines his results by giving feedback on exemplar images. Active selection methods aim to elicit useful feedback, but traditional approaches suffer from expensive selection criteria and cannot predict informativeness reliably due to the imprecision of relevance feedback. To address these drawbacks, we propose to actively select “pivot” exemplars for which feedback in the form of a visual comparison will most reduce the system’s uncertainty. For example, the system might ask, “Is your target image more or less crowded than this image? ” Our approach relies on a series of binary search trees in relative attribute space, together with a selection function that predicts the information gain were the user to compare his envisioned target to the next node deeper in a given attribute ’s tree. It makes interactive search more efficient than existing strategies—both in terms of the system ’s selection time as well as the user’s feedback effort.</p><p>6 0.6684925 <a title="248-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic_Transform%3A_Weakly_Supervised_Semantic_Inference_for_Relating_Visual_Attributes.html">380 iccv-2013-Semantic Transform: Weakly Supervised Semantic Inference for Relating Visual Attributes</a></p>

<p>Author: Liang-Chieh Chen, George Papandreou, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: The first main contribution of this paper is a novel method for representing images based on a dictionary of shape epitomes. These shape epitomes represent the local edge structure of the image and include hidden variables to encode shift and rotations. They are learnt in an unsupervised manner from groundtruth edges. This dictionary is compact but is also able to capture the typical shapes of edges in natural images. In this paper, we illustrate the shape epitomes by applying them to the image labeling task. In other work, described in the supplementary material, we apply them to edge detection and image modeling. We apply shape epitomes to image labeling by using Conditional Random Field (CRF) Models. They are alternatives to the superpixel or pixel representations used in most CRFs. In our approach, the shape of an image patch is encoded by a shape epitome from the dictionary. Unlike the superpixel representation, our method avoids making early decisions which cannot be reversed. Our resulting hierarchical CRFs efficiently capture both local and global class co-occurrence properties. We demonstrate its quanti- tative and qualitativeproperties ofour approach with image labeling experiments on two standard datasets: MSRC-21 and Stanford Background.</p><p>3 0.63108814 <a title="248-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Unified_Probabilistic_Approach_Modeling_Relationships_between_Attributes_and_Objects.html">31 iccv-2013-A Unified Probabilistic Approach Modeling Relationships between Attributes and Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoyang Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a unified probabilistic model to model the relationships between attributes and objects for attribute prediction and object recognition. As a list of semantically meaningful properties of objects, attributes generally relate to each other statistically. In this paper, we propose a unified probabilistic model to automatically discover and capture both the object-dependent and objectindependent attribute relationships. The model utilizes the captured relationships to benefit both attribute prediction and object recognition. Experiments on four benchmark attribute datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed unified model for improving attribute prediction as well as object recognition in both standard and zero-shot learning cases.</p><p>4 0.63080728 <a title="248-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Saliency_Detection_via_Absorbing_Markov_Chain.html">371 iccv-2013-Saliency Detection via Absorbing Markov Chain</a></p>
<p>Author: Bowen Jiang, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu, Chuan Yang, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we formulate saliency detection via absorbing Markov chain on an image graph model. We jointly consider the appearance divergence and spatial distribution of salient objects and the background. The virtual boundary nodes are chosen as the absorbing nodes in a Markov chain and the absorbed time from each transient node to boundary absorbing nodes is computed. The absorbed time of transient node measures its global similarity with all absorbing nodes, and thus salient objects can be consistently separated from the background when the absorbed time is used as a metric. Since the time from transient node to absorbing nodes relies on the weights on the path and their spatial distance, the background region on the center of image may be salient. We further exploit the equilibrium distribution in an ergodic Markov chain to reduce the absorbed time in the long-range smooth background regions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate robustness and efficiency of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.61607069 <a title="248-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Pedestrian_Parsing_via_Deep_Decompositional_Network.html">311 iccv-2013-Pedestrian Parsing via Deep Decompositional Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new Deep Decompositional Network (DDN) for parsing pedestrian images into semantic regions, such as hair, head, body, arms, and legs, where the pedestrians can be heavily occluded. Unlike existing methods based on template matching or Bayesian inference, our approach directly maps low-level visual features to the label maps of body parts with DDN, which is able to accurately estimate complex pose variations with good robustness to occlusions and background clutters. DDN jointly estimates occluded regions and segments body parts by stacking three types of hidden layers: occlusion estimation layers, completion layers, and decomposition layers. The occlusion estimation layers estimate a binary mask, indicating which part of a pedestrian is invisible. The completion layers synthesize low-level features of the invisible part from the original features and the occlusion mask. The decomposition layers directly transform the synthesized visual features to label maps. We devise a new strategy to pre-train these hidden layers, and then fine-tune the entire network using the stochastic gradient descent. Experimental results show that our approach achieves better segmentation accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods on pedestrian images with or without occlusions. Another important contribution of this paper is that it provides a large scale benchmark human parsing dataset1 that includes 3, 673 annotated samples collected from 171 surveillance videos. It is 20 times larger than existing public datasets.</p><p>6 0.6139127 <a title="248-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Quantize_and_Conquer%3A_A_Dimensionality-Recursive_Solution_to_Clustering%2C_Vector_Quantization%2C_and_Image_Retrieval.html">333 iccv-2013-Quantize and Conquer: A Dimensionality-Recursive Solution to Clustering, Vector Quantization, and Image Retrieval</a></p>

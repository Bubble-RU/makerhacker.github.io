<p>Author: Supreeth Achar, Stephen T. Nuske, Srinivasa G. Narasimhan</p><p>Abstract: Separating the direct and global components of radiance can aid shape recovery algorithms and can provide useful information about materials in a scene. Practical methods for finding the direct and global components use multiple images captured under varying illumination patterns and require the scene, light source and camera to remain stationary during the image acquisition process. In this paper, we develop a motion compensation method that relaxes this condition and allows direct-global separation to beperformed on video sequences of dynamic scenes captured by moving projector-camera systems. Key to our method is being able to register frames in a video sequence to each other in the presence of time varying, high frequency active illumination patterns. We compare our motion compensated method to alternatives such as single shot separation and frame interleaving as well as ground truth. We present results on challenging video sequences that include various types of motions and deformations in scenes that contain complex materials like fabric, skin, leaves and wax.</p><p>4 0.15624601 <a title="270-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_People_Detectors_for_Tracking_in_Crowded_Scenes.html">242 iccv-2013-Learning People Detectors for Tracking in Crowded Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Siyu Tang, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Anton Milan, Konrad Schindler, Stefan Roth, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: People tracking in crowded real-world scenes is challenging due to frequent and long-term occlusions. Recent tracking methods obtain the image evidence from object (people) detectors, but typically use off-the-shelf detectors and treat them as black box components. In this paper we argue that for best performance one should explicitly train people detectors on failure cases of the overall tracker instead. To that end, we first propose a novel joint people detector that combines a state-of-the-art single person detector with a detector for pairs of people, which explicitly exploits common patterns of person-person occlusions across multiple viewpoints that are a frequent failure case for tracking in crowded scenes. To explicitly address remaining failure modes of the tracker we explore two methods. First, we analyze typical failures of trackers and train a detector explicitly on these cases. And second, we train the detector with the people tracker in the loop, focusing on the most common tracker failures. We show that our joint multi-person detector significantly improves both de- tection accuracy as well as tracker performance, improving the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks.</p><p>5 0.14653541 <a title="270-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Multiple_Non-rigid_Surface_Detection_and_Registration.html">283 iccv-2013-Multiple Non-rigid Surface Detection and Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Wu, Yoshihisa Ijiri, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Detecting and registering nonrigid surfaces are two important research problems for computer vision. Much work has been done with the assumption that there exists only one instance in the image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that detects and registers multiple nonrigid instances of given objects in a cluttered image. Specifically, after we use low level feature points to obtain the initial matches between templates and the input image, a novel high-order affinity graph is constructed to model the consistency of local topology. A hierarchical clustering approach is then used to locate the nonrigid surfaces. To remove the outliers in the cluster, we propose a deterministic annealing approach based on the Thin Plate Spline (TPS) model. The proposed method achieves high accuracy even when the number of outliers is nineteen times larger than the inliers. As the matches may appear sparsely in each instance, we propose a TPS based match growing approach to propagate the matches. Finally, an approach that fuses feature and appearance information is proposed to register each nonrigid surface. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves promis- ing results in detecting and registering multiple non-rigid surfaces in a cluttered scene.</p><p>6 0.14545022 <a title="270-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_General_Dense_Image_Matching_Framework_Combining_Direct_and_Feature-Based_Costs.html">12 iccv-2013-A General Dense Image Matching Framework Combining Direct and Feature-Based Costs</a></p>

<p>Author: Marius Leordeanu, Andrei Zanfir, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Estimating a dense correspondence field between successive video frames, under large displacement, is important in many visual learning and recognition tasks. We propose a novel sparse-to-dense matching method for motion field estimation and occlusion detection. As an alternative to the current coarse-to-fine approaches from the optical flow literature, we start from the higher level of sparse matching with rich appearance and geometric constraints collected over extended neighborhoods, using an occlusion aware, locally affine model. Then, we move towards the simpler, but denser classic flow field model, with an interpolation procedure that offers a natural transition between the sparse and the dense correspondence fields. We experimentally demonstrate that our appearance features and our complex geometric constraintspermit the correct motion estimation even in difficult cases of large displacements and significant appearance changes. We also propose a novel classification method for occlusion detection that works in conjunction with the sparse-to-dense matching model. We validate our approach on the newly released Sintel dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results.</p><p>4 0.60991496 <a title="270-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_General_Dense_Image_Matching_Framework_Combining_Direct_and_Feature-Based_Costs.html">12 iccv-2013-A General Dense Image Matching Framework Combining Direct and Feature-Based Costs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jim Braux-Zin, Romain Dupont, Adrien Bartoli</p><p>Abstract: Dense motion field estimation (typically Romain Dupont1 romain . dupont @ cea . fr Adrien Bartoli2 adrien . bart o l @ gmai l com i . 2 ISIT, Universit e´ d’Auvergne/CNRS, France sions are explicitly modeled [32, 13]. Coarse-to-fine warping improves global convergence by making the assumption that optical flow, the motion of smaller structures is similar to the motion of stereo disparity and surface registration) is a key computer vision problem. Many solutions have been proposed to compute small or large displacements, narrow or wide baseline stereo disparity, but a unified methodology is still lacking. We here introduce a general framework that robustly combines direct and feature-based matching. The feature-based cost is built around a novel robust distance function that handles keypoints and “weak” features such as segments. It allows us to use putative feature matches which may contain mismatches to guide dense motion estimation out of local minima. Our framework uses a robust direct data term (AD-Census). It is implemented with a powerful second order Total Generalized Variation regularization with external and self-occlusion reasoning. Our framework achieves state of the art performance in several cases (standard optical flow benchmarks, wide-baseline stereo and non-rigid surface registration). Our framework has a modular design that customizes to specific application needs.</p><p>5 0.56743276 <a title="270-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-DeepFlow%3A_Large_Displacement_Optical_Flow_with_Deep_Matching.html">105 iccv-2013-DeepFlow: Large Displacement Optical Flow with Deep Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Philippe Weinzaepfel, Jerome Revaud, Zaid Harchaoui, Cordelia Schmid</p><p>Abstract: Optical flow computation is a key component in many computer vision systems designed for tasks such as action detection or activity recognition. However, despite several major advances over the last decade, handling large displacement in optical flow remains an open problem. Inspired by the large displacement optical flow of Brox & Malik [6], our approach, termed DeepFlow, blends a matching algorithm with a variational approach for optical flow. We propose a descriptor matching algorithm, tailored to the optical flow problem, that allows to boost performance on fast motions. The matching algorithm builds upon a multi-stage architecture with 6 layers, interleaving convolutions and max-pooling, a construction akin to deep convolutional nets. Using dense sampling, it allows to efficiently retrieve quasi-dense correspondences, and enjoys a built-in smoothing effect on descriptors matches, a valuable assetfor integration into an energy minimizationframework for optical flow estimation. DeepFlow efficiently handles large displacements occurring in realistic videos, and shows competitive performance on optical flow benchmarks. Furthermore, it sets a new state-of-the-art on the MPI-Sintel dataset [8].</p><p>6 0.55221277 <a title="270-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Multiple_Non-rigid_Surface_Detection_and_Registration.html">283 iccv-2013-Multiple Non-rigid Surface Detection and Registration</a></p>

Novel tilings can then be created, yielding facade textures with different dimensions or with occluded parts inpainted. A genetic algorithm guides the novel facades as well as inpainted parts to be consistent with the example, both in terms of their overall structure and their detailed textures.

In this work, we model self-occlusions and dis-occlusions in a joint shape and appearance tracking framework. Experiments on video exhibiting occlusion/dis-occlusion, complex radiance and background show that occlusion/dis-occlusion modeling leads to superior shape accuracy compared to recent methods employing joint shape/appearance models or employing global statistics.</p><p>3 0.69909352 <a title="270-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Content-Aware_Rotation.html">90 iccv-2013-Content-Aware Rotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kaiming He, Huiwen Chang, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: We present an image editing tool called Content-Aware Rotation. Casually shot photos can appear tilted, and are often corrected by rotation and cropping. This trivial solution may remove desired content and hurt image integrity. Instead of doing rigid rotation, we propose a warping method that creates the perception of rotation and avoids cropping. Human vision studies suggest that the perception of rotation is mainly due to horizontal/vertical lines. We design an optimization-based method that preserves the rotation of horizontal/vertical lines, maintains the completeness of the image content, and reduces the warping distortion. An efficient algorithm is developed to address the challenging optimization. We demonstrate our content-aware rotation method on a variety of practical cases.</p><p>4 0.67499363 <a title="270-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-On_One-Shot_Similarity_Kernels%3A_Explicit_Feature_Maps_and_Properties.html">295 iccv-2013-On One-Shot Similarity Kernels: Explicit Feature Maps and Properties</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefanos Zafeiriou, Irene Kotsia</p><p>Abstract: Kernels have been a common tool of machine learning and computer vision applications for modeling nonlinearities and/or the design of robust1 similarity measures between objects. Arguably, the class of positive semidefinite (psd) kernels, widely known as Mercer’s Kernels, constitutes one of the most well-studied cases. For every psd kernel there exists an associated feature map to an arbitrary dimensional Hilbert space H, the so-called feature space. Tdihme mnsaiionn reason ebreth sipnadc ep s Hd ,ke threne slos’-c c aplolpedul aferiattyu rise the fact that classification/regression techniques (such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs)) and component analysis algorithms (such as Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)) can be devised in H, without an explicit defisnisiti (oKnP of t)h)e c feature map, only by using athne xkperlniceitl (dtehfeso-called kernel trick). Recently, due to the development of very efficient solutions for large scale linear SVMs and for incremental linear component analysis, the research to- wards finding feature map approximations for classes of kernels has attracted significant interest. In this paper, we attempt the derivation of explicit feature maps of a recently proposed class of kernels, the so-called one-shot similarity kernels. We show that for this class of kernels either there exists an explicit representation in feature space or the kernel can be expressed in such a form that allows for exact incremental learning. We theoretically explore the properties of these kernels and show how these kernels can be used for the development of robust visual tracking, recognition and deformable fitting algorithms. 1Robustness may refer to either the presence of outliers and noise the robustness to a class of transformations (e.g., translation). or to ∗ Irene Kotsia ,†,? ∗Electronics Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Patras, Greece ?School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London i .kot s i @mdx . ac .uk a</p><p>5 0.65878707 <a title="270-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Quadruplet-Wise_Image_Similarity_Learning.html">332 iccv-2013-Quadruplet-Wise Image Similarity Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc T. Law, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel similarity learning framework. Working with inequality constraints involving quadruplets of images, our approach aims at efficiently modeling similarity from rich or complex semantic label relationships. From these quadruplet-wise constraints, we propose a similarity learning framework relying on a convex optimization scheme. We then study how our metric learning scheme can exploit specific class relationships, such as class ranking (relative attributes), and class taxonomy. We show that classification using the learned metrics gets improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on several datasets. We also evaluate our approach in a new application to learn similarities between webpage screenshots in a fully unsupervised way.</p><p>6 0.65488797 <a title="270-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Event_Detection_in_Complex_Scenes_Using_Interval_Temporal_Constraints.html">146 iccv-2013-Event Detection in Complex Scenes Using Interval Temporal Constraints</a></p>

Specifically, the layout of an image is represented as a composite of regions, each associated with a semantic topic. At the heart of this model is a novel stochastic process called Spatial Topic Process, which generates a spatial map of topics from a set of coupled Gaussian processes, thus allowing the distributions of topics to vary continuously across the image plane. A key aspect that distinguishes this model from previous ones consists in its capability of capturing dependencies across both locations and topics while allowing substantial variations in the layouts.

<p>Author: Alexander G. Schwing, Sanja Fidler, Marc Pollefeys, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose an approach to jointly infer the room layout as well as the objects present in the scene. Towards this goal, we propose a branch and bound algorithm which is guaranteed to retrieve the global optimum of the joint problem. The main difficulty resides in taking into account occlusion in order to not over-count the evidence. We introduce a new decomposition method, which generalizes integral geometry to triangular shapes, and allows us to bound the different terms in constant time. We exploit both geometric cues and object detectors as image features and show large improvements in 2D and 3D object detection over state-of-the-art deformable part-based models.</p><p>5 0.14286374 <a title="132-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Support_Surface_Prediction_in_Indoor_Scenes.html">410 iccv-2013-Support Surface Prediction in Indoor Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruiqi Guo, Derek Hoiem</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach to predict the extent and height of supporting surfaces such as tables, chairs, and cabinet tops from a single RGBD image. We define support surfaces to be horizontal, planar surfaces that can physically support objects and humans. Given a RGBD image, our goal is to localize the height and full extent of such surfaces in 3D space. To achieve this, we created a labeling tool and annotated 1449 images with rich, complete 3D scene models in NYU dataset. We extract ground truth from the annotated dataset and developed a pipeline for predicting floor space, walls, the height and full extent of support surfaces. Finally we match the predicted extent with annotated scenes in training scenes and transfer the the support surface configuration from training scenes. We evaluate the proposed approach in our dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in understanding scenes in 3D space.</p><p>6 0.14005503 <a title="132-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Structured_Forests_for_Fast_Edge_Detection.html">404 iccv-2013-Structured Forests for Fast Edge Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Gemma Roig, Xavier Boix, Roderick De_Nijs, Sebastian Ramos, Koljia Kuhnlenz, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Most MAP inference algorithms for CRFs optimize an energy function knowing all the potentials. In this paper, we focus on CRFs where the computational cost of instantiating the potentials is orders of magnitude higher than MAP inference. This is often the case in semantic image segmentation, where most potentials are instantiated by slow classifiers fed with costly features. We introduce Active MAP inference 1) to on-the-fly select a subset of potentials to be instantiated in the energy function, leaving the rest of the parameters of the potentials unknown, and 2) to estimate the MAP labeling from such incomplete energy function. Results for semantic segmentation benchmarks, namely PASCAL VOC 2010 [5] and MSRC-21 [19], show that Active MAP inference achieves similar levels of accuracy but with major efficiency gains.</p><p>4 0.74242222 <a title="132-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Characterizing_Layouts_of_Outdoor_Scenes_Using_Spatial_Topic_Processes.html">72 iccv-2013-Characterizing Layouts of Outdoor Scenes Using Spatial Topic Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Dahua Lin, Sanja Fidler, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of indoor scene understanding using RGBD data. Towards this goal, we propose a holistic approach that exploits 2D segmentation, 3D geometry, as well as contextual relations between scenes and objects. Specifically, we extend the CPMC [3] framework to 3D in order to generate candidate cuboids, and develop a conditional random field to integrate information from different sources to classify the cuboids. With this formulation, scene classification and 3D object recognition are coupled and can be jointly solved through probabilistic inference. We test the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging NYU v2 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that through effective evidence integration and holistic reasoning, our approach achieves substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.69316626 <a title="132-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Structured_Forests_for_Fast_Edge_Detection.html">404 iccv-2013-Structured Forests for Fast Edge Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Schiegg, Philipp Hanslovsky, Bernhard X. Kausler, Lars Hufnagel, Fred A. Hamprecht</p><p>Abstract: The quality of any tracking-by-assignment hinges on the accuracy of the foregoing target detection / segmentation step. In many kinds of images, errors in this first stage are unavoidable. These errors then propagate to, and corrupt, the tracking result. Our main contribution is the first probabilistic graphical model that can explicitly account for over- and undersegmentation errors even when the number of tracking targets is unknown and when they may divide, as in cell cultures. The tracking model we present implements global consistency constraints for the number of targets comprised by each detection and is solved to global optimality on reasonably large 2D+t and 3D+t datasets. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of a postprocessing that allows to establish target identity even across occlusion / undersegmentation. The usefulness and efficiency of this new tracking method is demonstrated on three different and challenging 2D+t and 3D+t datasets from developmental biology.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.77641761 <a title="132-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_3D_Scene_Labeling_Using_Fields_of_Trees.html">132 iccv-2013-Efficient 3D Scene Labeling Using Fields of Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Radu Timofte, Vincent De_Smet, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Recently there have been significant advances in image upscaling or image super-resolution based on a dictionary of low and high resolution exemplars. The running time of the methods is often ignored despite the fact that it is a critical factor for real applications. This paper proposes fast super-resolution methods while making no compromise on quality. First, we support the use of sparse learned dictionaries in combination with neighbor embedding methods. In this case, the nearest neighbors are computed using the correlation with the dictionary atoms rather than the Euclidean distance. Moreover, we show that most of the current approaches reach top performance for the right parameters. Second, we show that using global collaborative coding has considerable speed advantages, reducing the super-resolution mapping to a precomputed projective matrix. Third, we propose the anchored neighborhood regression. That is to anchor the neighborhood embedding of a low resolution patch to the nearest atom in the dictionary and to precompute the corresponding embedding matrix. These proposals are contrasted with current state-of- the-art methods on standard images. We obtain similar or improved quality and one or two orders of magnitude speed improvements.</p><p>4 0.76743191 <a title="132-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Concurrent_Action_Detection_with_Structural_Prediction.html">86 iccv-2013-Concurrent Action Detection with Structural Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Wei, Nanning Zheng, Yibiao Zhao, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Action recognition has often been posed as a classification problem, which assumes that a video sequence only have one action class label and different actions are independent. However, a single human body can perform multiple concurrent actions at the same time, and different actions interact with each other. This paper proposes a concurrent action detection model where the action detection is formulated as a structural prediction problem. In this model, an interval in a video sequence can be described by multiple action labels. An detected action interval is determined both by the unary local detector and the relations with other actions. We use a wavelet feature to represent the action sequence, and design a composite temporal logic descriptor to describe the action relations. The model parameters are trained by structural SVM learning. Given a long video sequence, a sequential decision window search algorithm is designed to detect the actions. Experiments on our new collected concurrent action dataset demonstrate the strength of our method.</p><p>5 0.76359284 <a title="132-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Intrinsic_Calibration_from_a_Single_Frame_Using_a_%22Plumb-Line%22_Approach.html">436 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Intrinsic Calibration from a Single Frame Using a "Plumb-Line" Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: R. Melo, M. Antunes, J.P. Barreto, G. Falcão, N. Gonçalves</p><p>Abstract: Estimating the amount and center ofdistortionfrom lines in the scene has been addressed in the literature by the socalled “plumb-line ” approach. In this paper we propose a new geometric method to estimate not only the distortion parameters but the entire camera calibration (up to an “angular” scale factor) using a minimum of 3 lines. We propose a new framework for the unsupervised simultaneous detection of natural image of lines and camera parameters estimation, enabling a robust calibration from a single image. Comparative experiments with existing automatic approaches for the distortion estimation and with ground truth data are presented.</p><p>6 0.74940503 <a title="132-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Motion_for_Every_Visible_Point.html">441 iccv-2013-Video Motion for Every Visible Point</a></p>

<p>Author: Zuzana Kukelova, Martin Bujnak, Tomas Pajdla</p><p>Abstract: Theproblem ofdetermining the absoluteposition andorientation of a camera from a set of 2D-to-3D point correspondences is one of the most important problems in computer vision with a broad range of applications. In this paper we present a new solution to the absolute pose problem for camera with unknown radial distortion and unknown focal length from five 2D-to-3D point correspondences. Our new solver is numerically more stable, more accurate, and significantly faster than the existing state-of-the-art minimal fourpoint absolutepose solvers for this problem. Moreover, our solver results in less solutions and can handle larger radial distortions. The new solver is straightforward and uses only simple concepts from linear algebra. Therefore it is simpler than the state-of-the-art Gr¨ obner basis solvers. We compare our new solver with the existing state-of-theart solvers and show its usefulness on synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.27168119 <a title="323-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Revisiting_the_PnP_Problem%3A_A_Fast%2C_General_and_Optimal_Solution.html">353 iccv-2013-Revisiting the PnP Problem: A Fast, General and Optimal Solution</a></p>
<p>Author: Yinqiang Zheng, Yubin Kuang, Shigeki Sugimoto, Kalle Åström, Masatoshi Okutomi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the classical perspective-n-point (PnP) problem, and propose the first non-iterative O(n) solution that is fast, generally applicable and globally optimal. Our basic idea is to formulate the PnP problem into a functional minimization problem and retrieve all its stationary points by using the Gr¨ obner basis technique. The novelty lies in a non-unit quaternion representation to parameterize the rotation and a simple but elegant formulation of the PnP problem into an unconstrained optimization problem. Interestingly, the polynomial system arising from its first-order optimality condition assumes two-fold symmetry, a nice property that can be utilized to improve speed and numerical stability of a Gr¨ obner basis solver. Experiment results have demonstrated that, in terms of accuracy, our proposed solution is definitely better than the state-ofthe-art O(n) methods, and even comparable with the reprojection error minimization method.</p><p>4 0.22018959 <a title="323-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Kneip, Simon Lynen</p><p>Abstract: This work makes use of a novel, recently proposed epipolar constraint for computing the relative pose between two calibrated images. By enforcing the coplanarity of epipolar plane normal vectors, it constrains the three degrees of freedom of the relative rotation between two camera views directly—independently of the translation. The present paper shows how the approach can be extended to n points, and translated into an efficient eigenvalue minimization over the three rotational degrees of freedom. Each iteration in the non-linear optimization has constant execution time, independently of the number of features. Two global optimization approaches are proposed. The first one consists of an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt scheme with randomized initial value, which already leads to stable and accurate results. The second scheme consists of a globally optimal branch-and-bound algorithm based on a bound on the eigenvalue variation derived from symmetric eigenvalue-perturbation theory. Analysis of the cost function reveals insights into the nature of a specific relative pose problem, and outlines the complexity under different conditions. The algorithm shows state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. essential-matrix based solutions, and a frameto-frame application to a video sequence immediately leads to an alternative, real-time visual odometry solution. Note: All algorithms in this paper are made available in the OpenGV library.

We argue that these primitives should be both visually discriminative and geometrically informative and we present a technique for discovering such primitives. We demonstrate the utility of our primitives by using them to infer 3D surface normals given a single image. Our technique substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art and shows improved cross-dataset performance.</p><p>6 0.14702557 <a title="323-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_Global_Linear_Method_for_Camera_Pose_Registration.html">17 iccv-2013-A Global Linear Method for Camera Pose Registration</a></p>

<p>Author: Amit Agrawal</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the extrinsic parameters (pose) of a camera with respect to a reference 3D object without a direct view. Since the camera does not view the object directly, previous approaches have utilized reflections in a planar mirror to solve this problem. However, a planar mirror based approach requires a minimum of three reflections and has degenerate configurations where estimation fails. In this paper, we show that the pose can be obtained using a single reflection in a spherical mirror of known radius. This makes our approach simpler and easier in practice. In addition, unlike planar mirrors, the spherical mirror based approach does not have any degenerate configurations, leading to a robust algorithm. While a planar mirror reflection results in a virtual perspective camera, a spherical mirror reflection results in a non-perspective axial camera. The axial nature of rays allows us to compute the axis (direction of sphere center) and few pose parameters in a linear fashion. We then derive an analytical solution to obtain the distance to the sphere cen- ter and remaining pose parameters and show that it corresponds to solving a 16th degree equation. We present comparisons with a recent method that use planar mirrors and show that our approach recovers more accurate pose in the presence of noise. Extensive simulations and results on real data validate our algorithm.</p><p>5 0.84197593 <a title="323-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Intrinsic_Calibration_from_a_Single_Frame_Using_a_%22Plumb-Line%22_Approach.html">436 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Intrinsic Calibration from a Single Frame Using a "Plumb-Line" Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: R. Melo, M. Antunes, J.P. Barreto, G. Falcão, N. Gonçalves</p><p>Abstract: Estimating the amount and center ofdistortionfrom lines in the scene has been addressed in the literature by the socalled “plumb-line ” approach. In this paper we propose a new geometric method to estimate not only the distortion parameters but the entire camera calibration (up to an “angular” scale factor) using a minimum of 3 lines. We propose a new framework for the unsupervised simultaneous detection of natural image of lines and camera parameters estimation, enabling a robust calibration from a single image. Comparative experiments with existing automatic approaches for the distortion estimation and with ground truth data are presented.</p><p>6 0.83469039 <a title="323-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>

<p>Author: Meng Yang, Luc Van_Gool, Lei Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Face recognition (FR) with a single training sample per person (STSPP) is a very challenging problem due to the lack of information to predict the variations in the query sample. Sparse representation based classification has shown interesting results in robust FR; however, its performance will deteriorate much for FR with STSPP. To address this issue, in this paper we learn a sparse variation dictionary from a generic training set to improve the query sample representation by STSPP. Instead of learning from the generic training set independently w.r.t. the gallery set, the proposed sparse variation dictionary learning (SVDL) method is adaptive to the gallery set by jointly learning a projection to connect the generic training set with the gallery set. The learnt sparse variation dictionary can be easily integrated into the framework of sparse representation based classification so that various variations in face images, including illumination, expression, occlusion, pose, etc., can be better handled. Experiments on the large-scale CMU Multi-PIE, FRGC and LFW databases demonstrate the promising performance of SVDL on FR with STSPP.</p><p>3 0.62705386 <a title="323-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Sparsity-Based_Orthogonal_Dictionary_Learning_for_Image_Restoration.html">161 iccv-2013-Fast Sparsity-Based Orthogonal Dictionary Learning for Image Restoration</a></p>
<p>Author: Chenglong Bao, Jian-Feng Cai, Hui Ji</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, how to learn a dictionary from input images for sparse modelling has been one very active topic in image processing and recognition. Most existing dictionary learning methods consider an over-complete dictionary, e.g. the K-SVD method. Often they require solving some minimization problem that is very challenging in terms of computational feasibility and efficiency. However, if the correlations among dictionary atoms are not well constrained, the redundancy of the dictionary does not necessarily improve the performance of sparse coding. This paper proposed a fast orthogonal dictionary learning method for sparse image representation. With comparable performance on several image restoration tasks, the proposed method is much more computationally efficient than the over-complete dictionary based learning methods.</p><p>4 0.60649896 <a title="323-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Structured_Light_in_Sunlight.html">405 iccv-2013-Structured Light in Sunlight</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohit Gupta, Qi Yin, Shree K. Nayar</p><p>Abstract: Strong ambient illumination severely degrades the performance of structured light based techniques. This is especially true in outdoor scenarios, where the structured light sources have to compete with sunlight, whose power is often 2-5 orders of magnitude larger than the projected light. In this paper, we propose the concept of light-concentration to overcome strong ambient illumination. Our key observation is that given a fixed light (power) budget, it is always better to allocate it sequentially in several portions of the scene, as compared to spreading it over the entire scene at once. For a desired level of accuracy, we show that by distributing light appropriately, the proposed approach requires 1-2 orders lower acquisition time than existing approaches. Our approach is illumination-adaptive as the optimal light distribution is determined based on a measurement of the ambient illumination level. Since current light sources have a fixed light distribution, we have built a prototype light source that supports flexible light distribution by controlling the scanning speed of a laser scanner. We show several high quality 3D scanning results in a wide range of outdoor scenarios. The proposed approach will benefit 3D vision systems that need to operate outdoors under extreme ambient illumination levels on a limited time and power budget.</p><p>5 0.57180136 <a title="323-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-GOSUS%3A_Grassmannian_Online_Subspace_Updates_with_Structured-Sparsity.html">182 iccv-2013-GOSUS: Grassmannian Online Subspace Updates with Structured-Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jia Xu, Vamsi K. Ithapu, Lopamudra Mukherjee, James M. Rehg, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online subspace learning in the context of sequential observations involving structured perturbations. In online subspace learning, the observations are an unknown mixture of two components presented to the model sequentially the main effect which pertains to the subspace and a residual/error term. If no additional requirement is imposed on the residual, it often corresponds to noise terms in the signal which were unaccounted for by the main effect. To remedy this, one may impose ‘structural’ contiguity, which has the intended effect of leveraging the secondary terms as a covariate that helps the estimation of the subspace itself, instead of merely serving as a noise residual. We show that the corresponding online estimation procedure can be written as an approximate optimization process on a Grassmannian. We propose an efficient numerical solution, GOSUS, Grassmannian Online Subspace Updates with Structured-sparsity, for this problem. GOSUS is expressive enough in modeling both homogeneous perturbations of the subspace and structural contiguities of outliers, and after certain manipulations, solvable — via an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We evaluate the empirical performance of this algorithm on two problems of interest: online background subtraction and online multiple face tracking, and demonstrate that it achieves competitive performance with the state-of-the-art in near real time.</p><p>6 0.56562388 <a title="323-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Real-Time_Solution_to_the_Absolute_Pose_Problem_with_Unknown_Radial_Distortion_and_Focal_Length.html">342 iccv-2013-Real-Time Solution to the Absolute Pose Problem with Unknown Radial Distortion and Focal Length</a></p>

<p>Author: Tae Hyun Kim, Byeongjoo Ahn, Kyoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: Most conventional single image deblurring methods assume that the underlying scene is static and the blur is caused by only camera shake. In this paper, in contrast to this restrictive assumption, we address the deblurring problem of general dynamic scenes which contain multiple moving objects as well as camera shake. In case of dynamic scenes, moving objects and background have different blur motions, so the segmentation of the motion blur is required for deblurring each distinct blur motion accurately. Thus, we propose a novel energy model designed with the weighted sum of multiple blur data models, which estimates different motion blurs and their associated pixelwise weights, and resulting sharp image. In this framework, the local weights are determined adaptively and get high values when the corresponding data models have high data fidelity. And, the weight information is used for the segmentation of the motion blur. Non-local regularization of weights are also incorporated to produce more reliable segmentation results. A convex optimization-based method is used for the solution of the proposed energy model. Exper- imental results demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches in deblurring both dynamic scenes and static scenes.</p><p>3 0.6408844 <a title="103-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Forward_Motion_Deblurring.html">174 iccv-2013-Forward Motion Deblurring</a></p>

<p>Author: Hae-Gon Jeon, Joon-Young Lee, Yudeog Han, Seon Joo Kim, In So Kweon</p><p>Abstract: Finding a good binary sequence is critical in determining theperformance ofthe coded exposure imaging, butprevious methods mostly rely on a random search for finding the binary codes, which could easily fail to find good long sequences due to the exponentially growing search space. In this paper, we present a new computationally efficient algorithm for generating the binary sequence, which is especially well suited for longer sequences. We show that the concept of the low autocorrelation binary sequence that has been well exploited in the information theory community can be applied for generating the fluttering patterns of the shutter, propose a new measure of a good binary sequence, and present a new algorithm by modifying the Legendre sequence for the coded exposure imaging. Experiments using both synthetic and real data show that our new algorithm consistently generates better binary sequencesfor the coded exposure problem, yielding better deblurring and resolution enhancement results compared to the previous methods for generating the binary codes.</p><p>5 0.22531532 <a title="103-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Nonparametric_Blind_Super-resolution.html">293 iccv-2013-Nonparametric Blind Super-resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Tomer Michaeli, Michal Irani</p><p>Abstract: Super resolution (SR) algorithms typically assume that the blur kernel is known (either the Point Spread Function ‘PSF’ of the camera, or some default low-pass filter, e.g. a Gaussian). However, the performance of SR methods significantly deteriorates when the assumed blur kernel deviates from the true one. We propose a general framework for “blind” super resolution. In particular, we show that: (i) Unlike the common belief, the PSF of the camera is the wrong blur kernel to use in SR algorithms. (ii) We show how the correct SR blur kernel can be recovered directly from the low-resolution image. This is done by exploiting the inherent recurrence property of small natural image patches (either internally within the same image, or externally in a collection of other natural images). In particular, we show that recurrence of small patches across scales of the low-res image (which forms the basis for single-image SR), can also be used for estimating the optimal blur kernel. This leads to significant improvement in SR results.</p><p>6 0.22031045 <a title="103-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Accurate_Blur_Models_vs._Image_Priors_in_Single_Image_Super-resolution.html">35 iccv-2013-Accurate Blur Models vs. Image Priors in Single Image Super-resolution</a></p>

<p>Author: Netalee Efrat, Daniel Glasner, Alexander Apartsin, Boaz Nadler, Anat Levin</p><p>Abstract: Over the past decade, single image Super-Resolution (SR) research has focused on developing sophisticated image priors, leading to significant advances. Estimating and incorporating the blur model, that relates the high-res and low-res images, has received much less attention, however. In particular, the reconstruction constraint, namely that the blurred and downsampled high-res output should approximately equal the low-res input image, has been either ignored or applied with default fixed blur models. In this work, we examine the relative importance ofthe imageprior and the reconstruction constraint. First, we show that an accurate reconstruction constraint combined with a simple gradient regularization achieves SR results almost as good as those of state-of-the-art algorithms with sophisticated image priors. Second, we study both empirically and theoretically the sensitivity of SR algorithms to the blur model assumed in the reconstruction constraint. We find that an accurate blur model is more important than a sophisticated image prior. Finally, using real camera data, we demonstrate that the default blur models of various SR algorithms may differ from the camera blur, typically leading to over- smoothed results. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately estimating camera blur in reconstructing raw low- res images acquired by an actual camera.</p><p>6 0.54543847 <a title="103-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Nonparametric_Blind_Super-resolution.html">293 iccv-2013-Nonparametric Blind Super-resolution</a></p>

Most previous deblurring methods that exploit information from other photos require an accurately registered photo of the same static scene. In contrast, our method aims to exploit reference images where the shared content may have undergone substantial photometric and non-rigid geometric transformations, as these are the kind of reference images most likely to be found in personal photo albums. Our approach builds upon a recent method for examplebased deblurring using non-rigid dense correspondence (NRDC) [11] and extends it in two ways. First, we suggest exploiting information from the reference image not only for blur kernel estimation, but also as a powerful local prior for the non-blind deconvolution step. Second, we introduce a simple yet robust technique for spatially varying blur estimation, rather than assuming spatially uniform blur. Unlike the aboveprevious method, which hasproven successful only with simple deblurring scenarios, we demonstrate that our method succeeds on a variety of real-world examples. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our method and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p><p>3 0.78089666 <a title="103-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Scene_Text_Localization_and_Recognition_with_Oriented_Stroke_Detection.html">376 iccv-2013-Scene Text Localization and Recognition with Oriented Stroke Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Lukáš Neumann, Jiri Matas</p><p>Abstract: An unconstrained end-to-end text localization and recognition method is presented. The method introduces a novel approach for character detection and recognition which combines the advantages of sliding-window and connected component methods. Characters are detected and recognized as image regions which contain strokes of specific orientations in a specific relative position, where the strokes are efficiently detected by convolving the image gradient field with a set of oriented bar filters. Additionally, a novel character representation efficiently calculated from the values obtained in the stroke detection phase is introduced. The representation is robust to shift at the stroke level, which makes it less sensitive to intra-class variations and the noise induced by normalizing character size and positioning. The effectiveness of the representation is demonstrated by the results achieved in the classification of real-world characters using an euclidian nearestneighbor classifier trained on synthetic data in a plain form. The method was evaluated on a standard dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition.</p><p>4 0.77614993 <a title="103-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Cross-Field_Joint_Image_Restoration_via_Scale_Map.html">98 iccv-2013-Cross-Field Joint Image Restoration via Scale Map</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiong Yan, Xiaoyong Shen, Li Xu, Shaojie Zhuo, Xiaopeng Zhang, Liang Shen, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: Color, infrared, and flash images captured in different fields can be employed to effectively eliminate noise and other visual artifacts. We propose a two-image restoration framework considering input images in different fields, for example, one noisy color image and one dark-flashed nearinfrared image. The major issue in such a framework is to handle structure divergence and find commonly usable edges and smooth transition for visually compelling image reconstruction. We introduce a scale map as a competent representation to explicitly model derivative-level confidence and propose new functions and a numerical solver to effectively infer it following new structural observations. Our method is general and shows a principled way for cross-field restoration.</p><p>5 0.77583992 <a title="103-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Flexible_Scene_Representation_for_3D_Reconstruction_Using_an_RGB-D_Camera.html">9 iccv-2013-A Flexible Scene Representation for 3D Reconstruction Using an RGB-D Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Diego Thomas, Akihiro Sugimoto</p><p>Abstract: Updating a global 3D model with live RGB-D measurements has proven to be successful for 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes. Recently, a Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) volumetric model and a fusion algorithm have been introduced (KinectFusion), showing significant advantages such as computational speed and accuracy of the reconstructed scene. This algorithm, however, is expensive in memory when constructing and updating the global model. As a consequence, the method is not well scalable to large scenes. We propose a new flexible 3D scene representation using a set of planes that is cheap in memory use and, nevertheless, achieves accurate reconstruction of indoor scenes from RGB-D image sequences. Projecting the scene onto different planes reduces significantly the size of the scene representation and thus it allows us to generate a global textured 3D model with lower memory requirement while keeping accuracy and easiness to update with live RGB-D measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed flexible 3D scene representation achieves accurate reconstruction, while keeping the scalability for large indoor scenes.</p><p>6 0.77277339 <a title="103-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Class-Specific_Simplex-Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_for_Image_Classification.html">73 iccv-2013-Class-Specific Simplex-Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Image Classification</a></p>

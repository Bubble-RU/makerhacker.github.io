<h1>121 iccv-2013-Discriminatively Trained Templates for 3D Object Detection: A Real Time Scalable Approach</h1>

<p>Author: Junliang Xing, Jin Gao, Bing Li, Weiming Hu, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: Recently, sparse representation has been introduced for robust object tracking. By representing the object sparsely, i.e., using only a few templates via ?1-norm minimization, these so-called ?1-trackers exhibit promising tracking results. In this work, we address the object template building and updating problem in these ?1-tracking approaches, which has not been fully studied. We propose to perform template updating, in a new perspective, as an online incremental dictionary learning problem, which is efficiently solved through an online optimization procedure. To guarantee the robustness and adaptability of the tracking algorithm, we also propose to build a multi-lifespan dictionary model. By building target dictionaries of different lifespans, effective object observations can be obtained to deal with the well-known drifting problem in tracking and thus improve the tracking accuracy. We derive effective observa- tion models both generatively and discriminatively based on the online multi-lifespan dictionary learning model and deploy them to the Bayesian sequential estimation framework to perform tracking. The proposed approach has been extensively evaluated on ten challenging video sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the online learned templates, as well as the state-of-the-art tracking performance of the proposed approach.</p><p>3 0.33843458 <a title="121-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Cosegmentation_and_Cosketch_by_Unsupervised_Learning.html">95 iccv-2013-Cosegmentation and Cosketch by Unsupervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jifeng Dai, Ying Nian Wu, Jie Zhou, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Cosegmentation refers to theproblem ofsegmenting multiple images simultaneously by exploiting the similarities between the foreground and background regions in these images. The key issue in cosegmentation is to align common objects between these images. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised learning framework for cosegmentation, by coupling cosegmentation with what we call “cosketch ”. The goal of cosketch is to automatically discover a codebook of deformable shape templates shared by the input images. These shape templates capture distinct image patterns and each template is matched to similar image patches in different images. Thus the cosketch of the images helps to align foreground objects, thereby providing crucial information for cosegmentation. We present a statistical model whose energy function couples cosketch and cosegmentation. We then present an unsupervised learning algorithm that performs cosketch and cosegmentation by energy minimization. Experiments show that our method outperforms state of the art methods for cosegmentation on the challenging MSRC and iCoseg datasets. We also illustrate our method on a new dataset called Coseg-Rep where cosegmentation can be performed within a single image with repetitive patterns.</p><p>4 0.27646819 <a title="121-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Calibration-Free_Gaze_Estimation_Using_Human_Gaze_Patterns.html">67 iccv-2013-Calibration-Free Gaze Estimation Using Human Gaze Patterns</a></p>
<p>Author: Fares Alnajar, Theo Gevers, Roberto Valenti, Sennay Ghebreab</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method to auto-calibrate gaze estimators based on gaze patterns obtained from other viewers. Our method is based on the observation that the gaze patterns of humans are indicative of where a new viewer will look at [12]. When a new viewer is looking at a stimulus, we first estimate a topology of gaze points (initial gaze points). Next, these points are transformed so that they match the gaze patterns of other humans to find the correct gaze points. In a flexible uncalibrated setup with a web camera and no chin rest, the proposed method was tested on ten subjects and ten images. The method estimates the gaze points after looking at a stimulus for a few seconds with an average accuracy of 4.3◦. Although the reported performance is lower than what could be achieved with dedicated hardware or calibrated setup, the proposed method still provides a sufficient accuracy to trace the viewer attention. This is promising considering the fact that auto-calibration is done in a flexible setup , without the use of a chin rest, and based only on a few seconds of gaze initialization data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use human gaze patterns in order to auto-calibrate gaze estimators.</p><p>5 0.27007493 <a title="121-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Robust_Non-negative_Dictionary_Learning_for_Visual_Tracking.html">298 iccv-2013-Online Robust Non-negative Dictionary Learning for Visual Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Naiyan Wang, Jingdong Wang, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the visual tracking problem in video sequences and presents a novel robust sparse tracker under the particle filter framework. In particular, we propose an online robust non-negative dictionary learning algorithm for updating the object templates so that each learned template can capture a distinctive aspect of the tracked object. Another appealing property of this approach is that it can automatically detect and reject the occlusion and cluttered background in a principled way. In addition, we propose a new particle representation formulation using the Huber loss function. The advantage is that it can yield robust estimation without using trivial templates adopted by previous sparse trackers, leading to faster computation. We also reveal the equivalence between this new formulation and the previous one which uses trivial templates. The proposed tracker is empirically compared with state-of-the-art trackers on some challenging video sequences. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons show that our proposed tracker is superior and more stable.</p><p>6 0.25104794 <a title="121-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Human_Re-identification_by_Matching_Compositional_Template_with_Cluster_Sampling.html">205 iccv-2013-Human Re-identification by Matching Compositional Template with Cluster Sampling</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuanlu Xu, Liang Lin, Wei-Shi Zheng, Xiaobai Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims at a newly raising task in visual surveillance: re-identifying people at a distance by matching body information, given several reference examples. Most of existing works solve this task by matching a reference template with the target individual, but often suffer from large human appearance variability (e.g. different poses/views, illumination) and high false positives in matching caused by conjunctions, occlusions or surrounding clutters. Addressing these problems, we construct a simple yet expressive template from a few reference images of a certain individual, which represents the body as an articulated assembly of compositional and alternative parts, and propose an effective matching algorithm with cluster sampling. This algorithm is designed within a candidacy graph whose vertices are matching candidates (i.e. a pair of source and target body parts), and iterates in two steps for convergence. (i) It generates possible partial matches based on compatible and competitive relations among body parts. (ii) It con- firms the partial matches to generate a new matching solution, which is accepted by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mechanism. In the experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on three public databases compared to existing methods.</p><p>6 0.62925518 <a title="121-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_a_Dictionary_of_Shape_Epitomes_with_Applications_to_Image_Labeling.html">245 iccv-2013-Learning a Dictionary of Shape Epitomes with Applications to Image Labeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Dan Xie, Sinisa Todorovic, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach to localizing functional objects in surveillance videos without domain knowledge about semantic object classes that may appear in the scene. Functional objects do not have discriminative appearance and shape, but they affect behavior of people in the scene. For example, they “attract” people to approach them for satisfying certain needs (e.g., vending machines could quench thirst), or “repel” people to avoid them (e.g., grass lawns). Therefore, functional objects can be viewed as “dark matter”, emanating “dark energy ” that affects people ’s trajectories in the video. To detect “dark matter” and infer their “dark energy ” field, we extend the Lagrangian mechanics. People are treated as particle-agents with latent intents to approach “dark matter” and thus satisfy their needs, where their motions are subject to a composite “dark energy ” field of all functional objects in the scene. We make the assumption that people take globally optimal paths toward the intended “dark matter” while avoiding latent obstacles. A Bayesian framework is used to probabilistically model: people ’s trajectories and intents, constraint map of the scene, and locations of functional objects. A data-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process is used for inference. Our evaluation on videos of public squares and courtyards demonstrates our effectiveness in localizing functional objects and predicting people ’s trajectories in unobserved parts of the video footage.</p><p>2 0.88274121 <a title="121-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven_Efficiently-Sampled_Sparse_Graphical_Models_for_Concurrent_Tumor_Segmentation_and_Atlas_Registration.html">432 iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven Efficiently-Sampled Sparse Graphical Models for Concurrent Tumor Segmentation and Atlas Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Sarah Parisot, William Wells_III, Stéphane Chemouny, Hugues Duffau, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based methods have become popular in recent years and have successfully addressed tasks like segmentation and deformable registration. Their main strength is optimality of the obtained solution while their main limitation is the lack of precision due to the grid-like representations and the discrete nature of the quantized search space. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for combined segmentation/registration of brain tumors that adapts graph and sampling resolution according to the image content. To this end we estimate the segmentation and registration marginals towards adaptive graph resolution and intelligent definition of the search space. This information is considered in a hierarchical framework where uncertainties are propagated in a natural manner. State of the art results in the joint segmentation/registration of brain images with low-grade gliomas demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>3 0.88057774 <a title="121-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Bayesian_3D_Tracking_from_Monocular_Video.html">58 iccv-2013-Bayesian 3D Tracking from Monocular Video</a></p>

We develop a Bayesian modeling approach for tracking people in 3D from monocular video with unknown cameras. Modeling in 3D provides natural explanations for occlusions and smoothness discontinuities that result from projection, and allows priors on velocity and smoothness to be grounded in physical quantities: meters and seconds vs. pixels and frames. We pose the problem in the context of data association, in which observations are assigned to tracks. A correct application of Bayesian inference to multitarget tracking must address the fact that the model’s dimension changes as tracks are added or removed, and thus, posterior densities of different hypotheses are not comparable. We address this by marginalizing out the trajectory parameters so the resulting posterior over data associations has constant dimension. This is made tractable by using (a) Gaussian process priors for smooth trajectories and (b) approximately Gaussian likelihood functions. Our approach provides a principled method for incorporating multiple sources of evidence; we present results using both optical flow and object detector outputs. Results are comparable to recent work on 3D tracking and, unlike others, our method requires no pre-calibrated cameras.</p><p>4 0.83154321 <a title="121-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-How_Related_Exemplars_Help_Complex_Event_Detection_in_Web_Videos%3F.html">203 iccv-2013-How Related Exemplars Help Complex Event Detection in Web Videos?</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Yang, Zhigang Ma, Zhongwen Xu, Shuicheng Yan, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Compared to visual concepts such as actions, scenes and objects, complex event is a higher level abstraction of longer video sequences. For example, a “marriage proposal” event is described by multiple objects (e.g., ring, faces), scenes (e.g., in a restaurant, outdoor) and actions (e.g., kneeling down). The positive exemplars which exactly convey the precise semantic of an event are hard to obtain. It would be beneficial to utilize the related exemplars for complex event detection. However, the semantic correlations between related exemplars and the target event vary substantially as relatedness assessment is subjective. Two related exemplars can be about completely different events, e.g., in the TRECVID MED dataset, both bicycle riding and equestrianism are labeled as related to “attempting a bike trick” event. To tackle the subjectiveness of human assessment, our algorithm automatically evaluates how positive the related exemplars are for the detection of an event and uses them on an exemplar-specific basis. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is able to utilize related exemplars adaptively, and the algorithm gains good perform- z. ance for complex event detection.</p><p>5 0.81020302 <a title="121-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Alternating_Regression_Forests_for_Object_Detection_and_Pose_Estimation.html">47 iccv-2013-Alternating Regression Forests for Object Detection and Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel Schulter, Christian Leistner, Paul Wohlhart, Peter M. Roth, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: We present Alternating Regression Forests (ARFs), a novel regression algorithm that learns a Random Forest by optimizing a global loss function over all trees. This interrelates the information of single trees during the training phase and results in more accurate predictions. ARFs can minimize any differentiable regression loss without sacrificing the appealing properties of Random Forests, like low computational complexity during both, training and testing. Inspired by recent developments for classification [19], we derive a new algorithm capable of dealing with different regression loss functions, discuss its properties and investigate the relations to other methods like Boosted Trees. We evaluate ARFs on standard machine learning benchmarks, where we observe better generalization power compared to both standard Random Forests and Boosted Trees. Moreover, we apply the proposed regressor to two computer vision applications: object detection and head pose estimation from depth images. ARFs outperform the Random Forest baselines in both tasks, illustrating the importance of optimizing a common loss function for all trees.</p><p>6 0.79997677 <a title="121-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Object_Tracking_with_Online_Multi-lifespan_Dictionary_Learning.html">359 iccv-2013-Robust Object Tracking with Online Multi-lifespan Dictionary Learning</a></p>

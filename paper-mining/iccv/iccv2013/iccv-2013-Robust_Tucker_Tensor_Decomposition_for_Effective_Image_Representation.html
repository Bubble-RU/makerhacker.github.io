<p>Author: Jin Gao, Junliang Xing, Weiming Hu, Steve Maybank</p><p>Abstract: Visual tracking has witnessed growing methods in object representation, which is crucial to robust tracking. The dominant mechanism in object representation is using image features encoded in a vector as observations to perform tracking, without considering that an image is intrinsically a matrix, or a 2nd-order tensor. Thus approaches following this mechanism inevitably lose a lot of useful information, and therefore cannot fully exploit the spatial correlations within the 2D image ensembles. In this paper, we address an image as a 2nd-order tensor in its original form, and find a discriminative linear embedding space approximation to the original nonlinear submanifold embedded in the tensor space based on the graph embedding framework. We specially design two graphs for characterizing the intrinsic local geometrical structure of the tensor space, so as to retain more discriminant information when reducing the dimension along certain tensor dimensions. However, spatial correlations within a tensor are not limited to the elements along these dimensions. This means that some part of the discriminant information may not be encoded in the embedding space. We introduce a novel technique called semi-supervised improvement to iteratively adjust the embedding space to compensate for the loss of discriminant information, hence improving the performance of our tracker. Experimental results on challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker.</p><p>3 0.12323307 <a title="362-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Global_Fusion_of_Relative_Motions_for_Robust%2C_Accurate_and_Scalable_Structure_from_Motion.html">184 iccv-2013-Global Fusion of Relative Motions for Robust, Accurate and Scalable Structure from Motion</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Moulon, Pascal Monasse, Renaud Marlet</p><p>Abstract: Multi-view structure from motion (SfM) estimates the position and orientation of pictures in a common 3D coordinate frame. When views are treated incrementally, this external calibration can be subject to drift, contrary to global methods that distribute residual errors evenly. We propose a new global calibration approach based on the fusion of relative motions between image pairs. We improve an existing method for robustly computing global rotations. We present an efficient a contrario trifocal tensor estimation method, from which stable and precise translation directions can be extracted. We also define an efficient translation registration method that recovers accurate camera positions. These components are combined into an original SfM pipeline. Our experiments show that, on most datasets, it outperforms in accuracy other existing incremental and global pipelines. It also achieves strikingly good running times: it is about 20 times faster than the other global method we could compare to, and as fast as the best incremental method. More importantly, it features better scalability properties.</p><p>4 0.079578996 <a title="362-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_Higher-Order_Clustering_on_the_Grassmann_Manifold.html">134 iccv-2013-Efficient Higher-Order Clustering on the Grassmann Manifold</a></p>
<p>Author: Suraj Jain, Venu Madhav Govindu</p><p>Abstract: The higher-order clustering problem arises when data is drawn from multiple subspaces or when observations fit a higher-order parametric model. Most solutions to this problem either decompose higher-order similarity measures for use in spectral clustering or explicitly use low-rank matrix representations. In this paper we present our approach of Sparse Grassmann Clustering (SGC) that combines attributes of both categories. While we decompose the higherorder similarity tensor, we cluster data by directly finding a low dimensional representation without explicitly building a similarity matrix. By exploiting recent advances in online estimation on the Grassmann manifold (GROUSE) we develop an efficient and accurate algorithm that works with individual columns of similarities or partial observations thereof. Since it avoids the storage and decomposition of large similarity matrices, our method is efficient, scalable and has low memory requirements even for large-scale data. We demonstrate the performance of our SGC method on a variety of segmentation problems including planar seg- mentation of Kinect depth maps and motion segmentation of the Hopkins 155 dataset for which we achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art.</p><p>5 0.079356082 <a title="362-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Unifying_Nuclear_Norm_and_Bilinear_Factorization_Approaches_for_Low-Rank_Matrix_Decomposition.html">434 iccv-2013-Unifying Nuclear Norm and Bilinear Factorization Approaches for Low-Rank Matrix Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ricardo Cabral, Fernando De_La_Torre, Jo√£o P. Costeira, Alexandre Bernardino</p><p>Abstract: Low rank models have been widely usedfor the representation of shape, appearance or motion in computer vision problems. Traditional approaches to fit low rank models make use of an explicit bilinear factorization. These approaches benefit from fast numerical methods for optimization and easy kernelization. However, they suffer from serious local minima problems depending on the loss function and the amount/type of missing data. Recently, these lowrank models have alternatively been formulated as convex problems using the nuclear norm regularizer; unlike factorization methods, their numerical solvers are slow and it is unclear how to kernelize them or to impose a rank a priori. This paper proposes a unified approach to bilinear factorization and nuclear norm regularization, that inherits the benefits of both. We analyze the conditions under which these approaches are equivalent. Moreover, based on this analysis, we propose a new optimization algorithm and a ‚Äúrank continuation ‚Äù strategy that outperform state-of-theart approaches for Robust PCA, Structure from Motion and Photometric Stereo with outliers and missing data.</p><p>6 0.07639458 <a title="362-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Dictionary_Learning_by_Error_Source_Decomposition.html">354 iccv-2013-Robust Dictionary Learning by Error Source Decomposition</a></p>

<p>Author: Hesamoddin Salehian, Guang Cheng, Baba C. Vemuri, Jeffrey Ho</p><p>Abstract: Symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices are ubiquitous in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Medical Image Analysis. Finding the center/average of a population of such matrices is a common theme in many algorithms such as clustering, segmentation, principal geodesic analysis, etc. The center of a population of such matrices can be defined using a variety of distance/divergence measures as the minimizer of the sum of squared distances/divergences from the unknown center to the members of the population. It is well known that the computation of the Karcher mean for the space of SPD matrices which is a negativelycurved Riemannian manifold is computationally expensive. Recently, the LogDet divergence-based center was shown to be a computationally attractive alternative. However, the LogDet-based mean of more than two matrices can not be computed in closed form, which makes it computationally less attractive for large populations. In this paper we present a novel recursive estimator for center based on the Stein distance which is the square root of the LogDet di‚Äì vergence that is significantly faster than the batch mode computation of this center. The key theoretical contribution is a closed-form solution for the weighted Stein center of two SPD matrices, which is used in the recursive computation of the Stein center for a population of SPD matrices. Additionally, we show experimental evidence of the convergence of our recursive Stein center estimator to the batch mode Stein center. We present applications of our recursive estimator to K-means clustering and image indexing depicting significant time gains over corresponding algorithms that use the batch mode computations. For the latter application, we develop novel hashing functions using the Stein distance and apply it to publicly available data sets, and experimental results have shown favorable com‚Äì ‚àóThis research was funded in part by the NIH grant NS066340 to BCV. ‚Ä†Corresponding author parisons to other competing methods.</p><p>4 0.43790162 <a title="362-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Automatic_Kronecker_Product_Model_Based_Detection_of_Repeated_Patterns_in_2D_Urban_Images.html">55 iccv-2013-Automatic Kronecker Product Model Based Detection of Repeated Patterns in 2D Urban Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Juan Liu, Emmanouil Psarakis, Ioannis Stamos</p><p>Abstract: Repeated patterns (such as windows, tiles, balconies and doors) are prominent and significant features in urban scenes. Therefore, detection of these repeated patterns becomes very important for city scene analysis. This paper attacks the problem of repeated patterns detection in a precise, efficient and automatic way, by combining traditional feature extraction followed by a Kronecker product lowrank modeling approach. Our method is tailored for 2D images of building fac ¬∏ades. We have developed algorithms for automatic selection ofa representative texture withinfa ¬∏cade images using vanishing points and Harris corners. After rectifying the input images, we describe novel algorithms that extract repeated patterns by using Kronecker product based modeling that is based on a solid theoretical foundation. Our approach is unique and has not ever been used for fac ¬∏ade analysis. We have tested our algorithms in a large set of images.</p><p>5 0.43484899 <a title="362-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Generalized_Low-Rank_Appearance_Model_for_Spatio-temporally_Correlated_Rain_Streaks.html">15 iccv-2013-A Generalized Low-Rank Appearance Model for Spatio-temporally Correlated Rain Streaks</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi-Lei Chen, Chiou-Ting Hsu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank appearance model for removing rain streaks. Different from previous work, our method needs neither rain pixel detection nor time-consuming dictionary learning stage. Instead, as rain streaks usually reveal similar and repeated patterns on imaging scene, we propose and generalize a low-rank model from matrix to tensor structure in order to capture the spatio-temporally correlated rain streaks. With the appearance model, we thus remove rain streaks from image/video (and also other high-order image structure) in a unified way. Our experimental results demonstrate competitive (or even better) visual quality and efficient run-time in comparison with state of the art.</p><p>6 0.42273104 <a title="362-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Global_Fusion_of_Relative_Motions_for_Robust%2C_Accurate_and_Scalable_Structure_from_Motion.html">184 iccv-2013-Global Fusion of Relative Motions for Robust, Accurate and Scalable Structure from Motion</a></p>

<p>Author: Miao Zhang, Chris Ding</p><p>Abstract: Many tensor based algorithms have been proposed for the study of high dimensional data in a large variety ofcomputer vision and machine learning applications. However, most of the existing tensor analysis approaches are based on Frobenius norm, which makes them sensitive to outliers, because they minimize the sum of squared errors and enlarge the influence of both outliers and large feature noises. In this paper, we propose a robust Tucker tensor decomposition model (RTD) to suppress the influence of outliers, which uses L1-norm loss function. Yet, the optimization on L1-norm based tensor analysis is much harder than standard tensor decomposition. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to solve our RTD model. Moreover, tensor factorization-based image storage needs much less space than PCA based methods. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithm, and verify the robustness against image occlusions. Both numerical and visual results show that our RTD model is consistently better against the existence of outliers than previous tensor and PCA methods.</p><p>2 0.59226465 <a title="362-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Offline_Mobile_Instance_Retrieval_with_a_Small_Memory_Footprint.html">294 iccv-2013-Offline Mobile Instance Retrieval with a Small Memory Footprint</a></p>
<p>Author: Jayaguru Panda, Michael S. Brown, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: Existing mobile image instance retrieval applications assume a network-based usage where image features are sent to a server to query an online visual database. In this scenario, there are no restrictions on the size of the visual database. This paper, however, examines how to perform this same task offline, where the entire visual index must reside on the mobile device itself within a small memory footprint. Such solutions have applications on location recognition and product recognition. Mobile instance retrieval requires a significant reduction in the visual index size. To achieve this, we describe a set of strategies that can reduce the visual index up to 60-80 compared to a scatannd raerddu iens tthaen vceis rueatrli ienvdaelx xim upple tom 6en0t-8at0io √ón found on ddte osk atops or servers. While our proposed reduction steps affect the overall mean Average Precision (mAP), they are able to maintain a good Precision for the top K results (PK). We argue that for such offline application, maintaining a good PK is sufficient. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on several standard databases. A working application designed for a remote historical site is also presented. This application is able to reduce an 50,000 image index structure to 25 MBs while providing a precision of 97% for P10 and 100% for P1.</p><p>3 0.57670641 <a title="362-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Normal_Field_Integration_for_3D_Reconstruction_of_Mirroring_Objects.html">281 iccv-2013-Multi-view Normal Field Integration for 3D Reconstruction of Mirroring Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Weinmann, Aljosa Osep, Roland Ruiters, Reinhard Klein</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel, robust multi-view normal field integration technique for reconstructing the full 3D shape of mirroring objects. We employ a turntablebased setup with several cameras and displays. These are used to display illumination patterns which are reflected by the object surface. The pattern information observed in the cameras enables the calculation of individual volumetric normal fields for each combination of camera, display and turntable angle. As the pattern information might be blurred depending on the surface curvature or due to nonperfect mirroring surface characteristics, we locally adapt the decoding to the finest still resolvable pattern resolution. In complex real-world scenarios, the normal fields contain regions without observations due to occlusions and outliers due to interreflections and noise. Therefore, a robust reconstruction using only normal information is challenging. Via a non-parametric clustering of normal hypotheses derived for each point in the scene, we obtain both the most likely local surface normal and a local surface consistency estimate. This information is utilized in an iterative mincut based variational approach to reconstruct the surface geometry.</p><p>4 0.57407719 <a title="362-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_Max-Margin_Perspective_on_Sparse_Representation-Based_Classification.html">20 iccv-2013-A Max-Margin Perspective on Sparse Representation-Based Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhaowen Wang, Jianchao Yang, Nasser Nasrabadi, Thomas Huang</p><p>Abstract: Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) is a powerful tool in distinguishing signal categories which lie on different subspaces. Despite its wide application to visual recognition tasks, current understanding of SRC is solely based on a reconstructive perspective, which neither offers any guarantee on its classification performance nor provides any insight on how to design a discriminative dictionary for SRC. In this paper, we present a novel perspective towards SRC and interpret it as a margin classifier. The decision boundary and margin of SRC are analyzed in local regions where the support of sparse code is stable. Based on the derived margin, we propose a hinge loss function as the gauge for the classification performance of SRC. A stochastic gradient descent algorithm is implemented to maximize the margin of SRC and obtain more discriminative dictionaries. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting classification performance and improving dictionary quality over reconstructive ones. Classification results competitive with other state-ofthe-art sparse coding methods are reported on several data sets.</p><p>5 0.56540358 <a title="362-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Scene_Text_Localization_and_Recognition_with_Oriented_Stroke_Detection.html">376 iccv-2013-Scene Text Localization and Recognition with Oriented Stroke Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Luk√°≈° Neumann, Jiri Matas</p><p>Abstract: An unconstrained end-to-end text localization and recognition method is presented. The method introduces a novel approach for character detection and recognition which combines the advantages of sliding-window and connected component methods. Characters are detected and recognized as image regions which contain strokes of specific orientations in a specific relative position, where the strokes are efficiently detected by convolving the image gradient field with a set of oriented bar filters. Additionally, a novel character representation efficiently calculated from the values obtained in the stroke detection phase is introduced. The representation is robust to shift at the stroke level, which makes it less sensitive to intra-class variations and the noise induced by normalizing character size and positioning. The effectiveness of the representation is demonstrated by the results achieved in the classification of real-world characters using an euclidian nearestneighbor classifier trained on synthetic data in a plain form. The method was evaluated on a standard dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition.</p><p>6 0.56292248 <a title="362-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Estimating_Human_Pose_with_Flowing_Puppets.html">143 iccv-2013-Estimating Human Pose with Flowing Puppets</a></p>

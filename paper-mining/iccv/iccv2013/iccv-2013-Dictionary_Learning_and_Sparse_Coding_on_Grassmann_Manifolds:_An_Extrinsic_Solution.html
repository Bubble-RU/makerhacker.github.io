<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for 2D shape analysis using positive definite kernels defined on Kendall’s shape manifold. Different representations of 2D shapes are known to generate different nonlinear spaces. Due to the nonlinearity of these spaces, most existing shape classification algorithms resort to nearest neighbor methods and to learning distances on shape spaces. Here, we propose to map shapes on Kendall’s shape manifold to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To this end, we introduce a kernel on this manifold that permits such a mapping, and prove its positive definiteness. This kernel lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM, MKL and kernel PCA, to the shape manifold. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods on shape classification, clustering and retrieval.</p><p>3 0.37956733 <a title="114-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Manifold_Based_Face_Synthesis_from_Sparse_Samples.html">259 iccv-2013-Manifold Based Face Synthesis from Sparse Samples</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongteng Xu, Hongyuan Zha</p><p>Abstract: Data sparsity has been a thorny issuefor manifold-based image synthesis, and in this paper we address this critical problem by leveraging ideas from transfer learning. Specifically, we propose methods based on generating auxiliary data in the form of synthetic samples using transformations of the original sparse samples. To incorporate the auxiliary data, we propose a weighted data synthesis method, which adaptively selects from the generated samples for inclusion during the manifold learning process via a weighted iterative algorithm. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we apply it to the problem of face image synthesis from sparse samples. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method shows encouraging results with good performance improvements.</p><p>4 0.2644797 <a title="114-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Total_Variation_Regularization_for_Functions_with_Values_in_a_Manifold.html">421 iccv-2013-Total Variation Regularization for Functions with Values in a Manifold</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan Lellmann, Evgeny Strekalovskiy, Sabrina Koetter, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: While total variation is among the most popular regularizers for variational problems, its extension to functions with values in a manifold is an open problem. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to solve such problems which applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. The key idea is to reformulate the variational problem as a multilabel optimization problem with an infinite number of labels. This leads to a hard optimization problem which can be approximately solved using convex relaxation techniques. The framework can be easily adapted to different manifolds including spheres and three-dimensional rotations, and allows to obtain accurate solutions even with a relatively coarse discretization. With numerous examples we demonstrate that the proposed framework can be applied to variational models that incorporate chromaticity values, normal fields, or camera trajectories.</p><p>5 0.25810701 <a title="114-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Motion_Segmentation_Using_Dynamic_Label_Propagation.html">297 iccv-2013-Online Motion Segmentation Using Dynamic Label Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Elqursh, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: The vast majority of work on motion segmentation adopts the affine camera model due to its simplicity. Under the affine model, the motion segmentation problem becomes that of subspace separation. Due to this assumption, such methods are mainly offline and exhibit poor performance when the assumption is not satisfied. This is made evident in state-of-the-art methods that relax this assumption by using piecewise affine spaces and spectral clustering techniques to achieve better results. In this paper, we formulate the problem of motion segmentation as that of manifold separation. We then show how label propagation can be used in an online framework to achieve manifold separation. The performance of our framework is evaluated on a benchmark dataset and achieves competitive performance while being online.</p><p>6 0.25316077 <a title="114-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Log-Euclidean_Kernels_for_Sparse_Representation_and_Dictionary_Learning.html">257 iccv-2013-Log-Euclidean Kernels for Sparse Representation and Dictionary Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhan Yu, Xinqing Guo, Haibing Lin, Andrew Lumsdaine, Jingyi Yu</p><p>Abstract: Light fields are image-based representations that use densely sampled rays as a scene description. In this paper, we explore geometric structures of 3D lines in ray space for improving light field triangulation and stereo matching. The triangulation problem aims to fill in the ray space with continuous and non-overlapping simplices anchored at sampled points (rays). Such a triangulation provides a piecewise-linear interpolant useful for light field superresolution. We show that the light field space is largely bilinear due to 3D line segments in the scene, and direct triangulation of these bilinear subspaces leads to large errors. We instead present a simple but effective algorithm to first map bilinear subspaces to line constraints and then apply Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT). Based on our analysis, we further develop a novel line-assisted graphcut (LAGC) algorithm that effectively encodes 3D line constraints into light field stereo matching. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that both our triangulation and LAGC algorithms outperform state-of-the-art solutions in accuracy and visual quality.</p><p>2 0.76275355 <a title="114-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Curvature-Aware_Regularization_on_Riemannian_Submanifolds.html">100 iccv-2013-Curvature-Aware Regularization on Riemannian Submanifolds</a></p>

For dynamic scenes/cameras this introduces undesired effects like stretch, shear and wobble. It has been shown earlier that rotational shake induced rolling shutter effects in hand-held cell phone capture can be compensated based on an estimate of the camera rotation. In contrast, we analyse the case of significant camera motion, e.g. where a bypassing streetlevel capture vehicle uses a rolling shutter camera in a 3D reconstruction framework. The introduced error is depth dependent and cannot be compensated based on camera motion/rotation alone, invalidating also rectification for stereo camera systems. On top, significant lens distortion as often present in wide angle cameras intertwines with rolling shutter effects as it changes the time at which a certain 3D point is seen. We show that naive 3D reconstructions (assuming global shutter) will deliver biased geometry already for very mild assumptions on vehicle speed and resolution. We then develop rolling shutter dense multiview stereo algorithms that solve for time of exposure and depth at the same time, even in the presence of lens distortion and perform an evaluation on ground truth laser scan models as well as on real street-level data.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.72842705 <a title="114-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Dictionary_Learning_and_Sparse_Coding_on_Grassmann_Manifolds%3A_An_Extrinsic_Solution.html">114 iccv-2013-Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding on Grassmann Manifolds: An Extrinsic Solution</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehrtash Harandi, Conrad Sanderson, Chunhua Shen, Brian Lovell</p><p>Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning suggest that a wide range of problems can be addressed more appropriately by considering non-Euclidean geometry. In this paper we explore sparse dictionary learning over the space of linear subspaces, which form Riemannian structures known as Grassmann manifolds. To this end, we propose to embed Grassmann manifolds into the space of symmetric matrices by an isometric mapping, which enables us to devise a closed-form solution for updating a Grassmann dictionary, atom by atom. Furthermore, to handle non-linearity in data, we propose a kernelised version of the dictionary learning algorithm. Experiments on several classification tasks (face recognition, action recognition, dynamic texture classification) show that the proposed approach achieves considerable improvements in discrimination accuracy, in comparison to state-of-the-art methods such as kernelised Affine Hull Method and graphembedding Grassmann discriminant analysis.</p><p>5 0.72740108 <a title="114-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Elastic_Net_Constraints_for_Shape_Matching.html">140 iccv-2013-Elastic Net Constraints for Shape Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuele Rodolà, Andrea Torsello, Tatsuya Harada, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We consider a parametrized relaxation of the widely adopted quadratic assignment problem (QAP) formulation for minimum distortion correspondence between deformable shapes. In order to control the accuracy/sparsity trade-off we introduce a weighting parameter on the combination of two existing relaxations, namely spectral and game-theoretic. This leads to the introduction of the elastic net penalty function into shape matching problems. In combination with an efficient algorithm to project onto the elastic net ball, we obtain an approach for deformable shape matching with controllable sparsity. Experiments on a standard benchmark confirm the effectiveness of the approach.</p><p>6 0.72331375 <a title="114-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Shape_Index_Descriptors_Applied_to_Texture-Based_Galaxy_Analysis.html">388 iccv-2013-Shape Index Descriptors Applied to Texture-Based Galaxy Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Tal Hassner</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven method for estimating the 3D shapes of faces viewed in single, unconstrained photos (aka “in-the-wild”). Our method was designed with an emphasis on robustness and efficiency with the explicit goal of deployment in real-world applications which reconstruct and display faces in 3D. Our key observation is that for many practical applications, warping the shape of a reference face to match the appearance of a query, is enough to produce realistic impressions of the query ’s 3D shape. Doing so, however, requires matching visual features between the (possibly very different) query and reference images, while ensuring that a plausible face shape is produced. To this end, we describe an optimization process which seeks to maximize the similarity of appearances and depths, jointly, to those of a reference model. We describe our system for monocular face shape reconstruction and present both qualitative and quantitative experiments, comparing our method against alternative systems, and demonstrating its capabilities. Finally, as a testament to its suitability for real-world applications, we offer an open, online implementation of our system, providing unique means – of instant 3D viewing of faces appearing in web photos.</p><p>3 0.33086494 <a title="36-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Faces_Guided_Sparse_Many-to-One_Encoder_for_Pose-Invariant_Face_Recognition.html">335 iccv-2013-Random Faces Guided Sparse Many-to-One Encoder for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Yizhe Zhang, Ming Shao, Edward K. Wong, Yun Fu</p><p>Abstract: One of the most challenging task in face recognition is to identify people with varied poses. Namely, the test faces have significantly different poses compared with the registered faces. In this paper, we propose a high-level feature learning scheme to extract pose-invariant identity feature for face recognition. First, we build a single-hiddenlayer neural network with sparse constraint, to extractposeinvariant feature in a supervised fashion. Second, we further enhance the discriminative capability of the proposed feature by using multiple random faces as the target values for multiple encoders. By enforcing the target values to be uniquefor inputfaces over differentposes, the learned highlevel feature that is represented by the neurons in the hidden layer is pose free and only relevant to the identity information. Finally, we conduct face identification on CMU MultiPIE, and verification on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) databases, where identification rank-1 accuracy and face verification accuracy with ROC curve are reported. These experiments demonstrate that our model is superior to oth- er state-of-the-art approaches on handling pose variations.</p><p>4 0.32299525 <a title="36-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Face_Detector_Training_Using_Tailored_Views.html">157 iccv-2013-Fast Face Detector Training Using Tailored Views</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristina Scherbaum, James Petterson, Rogerio S. Feris, Volker Blanz, Hans-Peter Seidel</p><p>Abstract: Face detection is an important task in computer vision and often serves as the first step for a variety of applications. State-of-the-art approaches use efficient learning algorithms and train on large amounts of manually labeled imagery. Acquiring appropriate training images, however, is very time-consuming and does not guarantee that the collected training data is representative in terms of data variability. Moreover, available data sets are often acquired under controlled settings, restricting, for example, scene illumination or 3D head pose to a narrow range. This paper takes a look into the automated generation of adaptive training samples from a 3D morphable face model. Using statistical insights, the tailored training data guarantees full data variability and is enriched by arbitrary facial attributes such as age or body weight. Moreover, it can automatically adapt to environmental constraints, such as illumination or viewing angle of recorded video footage from surveillance cameras. We use the tailored imagery to train a new many-core imple- mentation of Viola Jones ’ AdaBoost object detection framework. The new implementation is not only faster but also enables the use of multiple feature channels such as color features at training time. In our experiments we trained seven view-dependent face detectors and evaluate these on the Face Detection Data Set and Benchmark (FDDB). Our experiments show that the use of tailored training imagery outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on this challenging dataset.</p><p>5 0.26940954 <a title="36-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Tracking_Revisited_Using_RGBD_Camera%3A_Unified_Benchmark_and_Baselines.html">424 iccv-2013-Tracking Revisited Using RGBD Camera: Unified Benchmark and Baselines</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuran Song, Jianxiong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Despite significant progress, tracking is still considered to be a very challenging task. Recently, the increasing popularity of depth sensors has made it possible to obtain reliable depth easily. This may be a game changer for tracking, since depth can be used to prevent model drift and handle occlusion. We also observe that current tracking algorithms are mostly evaluated on a very small number of videos collectedandannotated by different groups. The lack of a reasonable size and consistently constructed benchmark has prevented a persuasive comparison among different algorithms. In this paper, we construct a unified benchmark dataset of 100 RGBD videos with high diversity, propose different kinds of RGBD tracking algorithms using 2D or 3D model, and present a quantitative comparison of various algorithms with RGB or RGBD input. We aim to lay the foundation for further research in both RGB and RGBD tracking, and our benchmark is available at http://tracking.cs.princeton.edu.</p><p>6 0.25548545 <a title="36-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Multiview_Photometric_Stereo_Using_Planar_Mesh_Parameterization.html">284 iccv-2013-Multiview Photometric Stereo Using Planar Mesh Parameterization</a></p>

<p>Author: Dihong Gong, Zhifeng Li, Dahua Lin, Jianzhuang Liu, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: Age invariant face recognition has received increasing attention due to its great potential in real world applications. In spite of the great progress in face recognition techniques, reliably recognizingfaces across ages remains a difficult task. The facial appearance of a person changes substantially over time, resulting in significant intra-class variations. Hence, the key to tackle this problem is to separate the variation caused by aging from the person-specific features that are stable. Specifically, we propose a new method, calledHidden FactorAnalysis (HFA). This methodcaptures the intuition above through a probabilistic model with two latent factors: an identity factor that is age-invariant and an age factor affected by the aging process. Then, the observed appearance can be modeled as a combination of the components generated based on these factors. We also develop a learning algorithm that jointly estimates the latent factors and the model parameters using an EM procedure. Extensive experiments on two well-known public domain face aging datasets: MORPH (the largest public face aging database) and FGNET, clearly show that the proposed method achieves notable improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><p>6 0.64818251 <a title="36-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Face_Detector_Training_Using_Tailored_Views.html">157 iccv-2013-Fast Face Detector Training Using Tailored Views</a></p>

<p>Author: Yan Xia, Kaiming He, Fang Wen, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: Inverted indexing is a popular non-exhaustive solution to large scale search. An inverted file is built by a quantizer such as k-means or a tree structure. It has been found that multiple inverted files, obtained by multiple independent random quantizers, are able to achieve practically good recall and speed. Instead of computing the multiple quantizers independently, we present a method that creates them jointly. Our method jointly optimizes all codewords in all quantizers. Then it assigns these codewords to the quantizers. In experiments this method shows significant improvement over various existing methods that use multiple independent quantizers. On the one-billion set of SIFT vectors, our method is faster and more accurate than a recent state-of-the-art inverted indexing method.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.90664178 <a title="36-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Accurate_and_Robust_3D_Facial_Capture_Using_a_Single_RGBD_Camera.html">36 iccv-2013-Accurate and Robust 3D Facial Capture Using a Single RGBD Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Yen-Lin Chen, Hsiang-Tao Wu, Fuhao Shi, Xin Tong, Jinxiang Chai</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an automatic and robust approach that accurately captures high-quality 3D facial performances using a single RGBD camera. The key of our approach is to combine the power of automatic facial feature detection and image-based 3D nonrigid registration techniques for 3D facial reconstruction. In particular, we develop a robust and accurate image-based nonrigid registration algorithm that incrementally deforms a 3D template mesh model to best match observed depth image data and important facial features detected from single RGBD images. The whole process is fully automatic and robust because it is based on single frame facial registration framework. The system is flexible because it does not require any strong 3D facial priors such as blendshape models. We demonstrate the power of our approach by capturing a wide range of 3D facial expressions using a single RGBD camera and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy by comparing against alternative methods.</p><p>3 0.90156335 <a title="36-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Subspace_Stabilization_for_Stereoscopic_Video.html">226 iccv-2013-Joint Subspace Stabilization for Stereoscopic Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Feng Liu, Yuzhen Niu, Hailin Jin</p><p>Abstract: Shaky stereoscopic video is not only unpleasant to watch but may also cause 3D fatigue. Stabilizing the left and right view of a stereoscopic video separately using a monocular stabilization method tends to both introduce undesirable vertical disparities and damage horizontal disparities, which may destroy the stereoscopic viewing experience. In this paper, we present a joint subspace stabilization method for stereoscopic video. We prove that the low-rank subspace constraint for monocular video [10] also holds for stereoscopic video. Particularly, the feature trajectories from the left and right video share the same subspace. Based on this proof, we develop a stereo subspace stabilization method that jointly computes a common subspace from the left and right video and uses it to stabilize the two videos simultaneously. Our method meets the stereoscopic constraints without 3D reconstruction or explicit left-right correspondence. We test our method on a variety of stereoscopic videos with different scene content and camera motion. The experiments show that our method achieves high-quality stabilization for stereoscopic video in a robust and efficient way.</p><p>4 0.89694613 <a title="36-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_and_Robust_Large-Scale_Rotation_Averaging.html">138 iccv-2013-Efficient and Robust Large-Scale Rotation Averaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Avishek Chatterjee, Venu Madhav Govindu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of robust and efficient averaging of relative 3D rotations. Apart from having an interesting geometric structure, robust rotation averaging addresses the need for a good initialization for largescale optimization used in structure-from-motion pipelines. Such pipelines often use unstructured image datasets harvested from the internet thereby requiring an initialization method that is robust to outliers. Our approach works on the Lie group structure of 3D rotations and solves the problem of large-scale robust rotation averaging in two ways. Firstly, we use modern ?1 optimizers to carry out robust averaging of relative rotations that is efficient, scalable and robust to outliers. In addition, we also develop a twostep method that uses the ?1 solution as an initialisation for an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach. These methods achieve excellent results on large-scale, real world datasets and significantly outperform existing methods, i.e. the state-of-the-art discrete-continuous optimization method of [3] as well as the Weiszfeld method of [8]. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two large- scale real world datasets and also provide the results of the two aforementioned methods for comparison.</p><p>5 0.89555103 <a title="36-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Go-ICP%3A_Solving_3D_Registration_Efficiently_and_Globally_Optimally.html">185 iccv-2013-Go-ICP: Solving 3D Registration Efficiently and Globally Optimally</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiaolong Yang, Hongdong Li, Yunde Jia</p><p>Abstract: Registration is a fundamental task in computer vision. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is one of the widely-used methods for solving the registration problem. Based on local iteration, ICP is however well-known to suffer from local minima. Its performance critically relies on the quality of initialization, and only local optimality is guaranteed. This paper provides the very first globally optimal solution to Euclidean registration of two 3D pointsets or two 3D surfaces under the L2 error. Our method is built upon ICP, but combines it with a branch-and-bound (BnB) scheme which searches the 3D motion space SE(3) efficiently. By exploiting the special structure of the underlying geometry, we derive novel upper and lower bounds for the ICP error function. The integration of local ICP and global BnB enables the new method to run efficiently in practice, and its optimality is exactly guaranteed. We also discuss extensions, addressing the issue of outlier robustness.</p><p>6 0.89400029 <a title="36-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Hybrid_Deep_Learning_for_Face_Verification.html">206 iccv-2013-Hybrid Deep Learning for Face Verification</a></p>

<p>Author: Siyu Tang, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Anton Milan, Konrad Schindler, Stefan Roth, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: People tracking in crowded real-world scenes is challenging due to frequent and long-term occlusions. Recent tracking methods obtain the image evidence from object (people) detectors, but typically use off-the-shelf detectors and treat them as black box components. In this paper we argue that for best performance one should explicitly train people detectors on failure cases of the overall tracker instead. To that end, we first propose a novel joint people detector that combines a state-of-the-art single person detector with a detector for pairs of people, which explicitly exploits common patterns of person-person occlusions across multiple viewpoints that are a frequent failure case for tracking in crowded scenes. To explicitly address remaining failure modes of the tracker we explore two methods. First, we analyze typical failures of trackers and train a detector explicitly on these cases. And second, we train the detector with the people tracker in the loop, focusing on the most common tracker failures. We show that our joint multi-person detector significantly improves both de- tection accuracy as well as tracker performance, improving the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks.</p><p>3 0.34416103 <a title="269-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Handling_Occlusions_with_Franken-Classifiers.html">190 iccv-2013-Handling Occlusions with Franken-Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Markus Mathias, Rodrigo Benenson, Radu Timofte, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Detecting partially occluded pedestrians is challenging. A common practice to maximize detection quality is to train a set of occlusion-specific classifiers, each for a certain amount and type of occlusion. Since training classifiers is expensive, only a handful are typically trained. We show that by using many occlusion-specific classifiers, we outperform previous approaches on three pedestrian datasets; INRIA, ETH, and Caltech USA. We present a new approach to train such classifiers. By reusing computations among different training stages, 16 occlusion-specific classifiers can be trained at only one tenth the cost of one full training. We show that also test time cost grows sub-linearly.</p><p>4 0.1898327 <a title="269-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Locally_Affine_Sparse-to-Dense_Matching_for_Motion_and_Occlusion_Estimation.html">256 iccv-2013-Locally Affine Sparse-to-Dense Matching for Motion and Occlusion Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Marius Leordeanu, Andrei Zanfir, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Estimating a dense correspondence field between successive video frames, under large displacement, is important in many visual learning and recognition tasks. We propose a novel sparse-to-dense matching method for motion field estimation and occlusion detection. As an alternative to the current coarse-to-fine approaches from the optical flow literature, we start from the higher level of sparse matching with rich appearance and geometric constraints collected over extended neighborhoods, using an occlusion aware, locally affine model. Then, we move towards the simpler, but denser classic flow field model, with an interpolation procedure that offers a natural transition between the sparse and the dense correspondence fields. We experimentally demonstrate that our appearance features and our complex geometric constraintspermit the correct motion estimation even in difficult cases of large displacements and significant appearance changes. We also propose a novel classification method for occlusion detection that works in conjunction with the sparse-to-dense matching model. We validate our approach on the newly released Sintel dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results.</p><p>5 0.1881258 <a title="269-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Combining_the_Right_Features_for_Complex_Event_Recognition.html">81 iccv-2013-Combining the Right Features for Complex Event Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Tang, Bangpeng Yao, Li Fei-Fei, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of combining features extracted from video for complex event recognition. Feature combination is an especially relevant task in video data, as there are many features we can extract, ranging from image features computed from individual frames to video features that take temporal information into account. To combine features effectively, we propose a method that is able to be selective of different subsets of features, as some features or feature combinations may be uninformative for certain classes. We introduce a hierarchical method for combining features based on the AND/OR graph structure, where nodes in the graph represent combinations of different sets of features. Our method automatically learns the structure of the AND/OR graph using score-based structure learning, and we introduce an inference procedure that is able to efficiently compute structure scores. We present promising results and analysis on the difficult and large-scale 2011 TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection dataset [17].</p><p>6 0.18226723 <a title="269-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Tracking_Revisited_Using_RGBD_Camera%3A_Unified_Benchmark_and_Baselines.html">424 iccv-2013-Tracking Revisited Using RGBD Camera: Unified Benchmark and Baselines</a></p>

<p>Author: Yanchao Yang, Ganesh Sundaramoorthi</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to track the precise shape of a dynamic object in video. Joint dynamic shape and appearance models, in which a template of the object is propagated to match the object shape and radiance in the next frame, are advantageous over methods employing global image statistics in cases of complex object radiance and cluttered background. In cases of complex 3D object motion and relative viewpoint change, self-occlusions and disocclusions of the object are prominent, and current methods employing joint shape and appearance models are unable to accurately adapt to new shape and appearance information, leading to inaccurate shape detection. In this work, we model self-occlusions and dis-occlusions in a joint shape and appearance tracking framework. Experiments on video exhibiting occlusion/dis-occlusion, complex radiance and background show that occlusion/dis-occlusion modeling leads to superior shape accuracy compared to recent methods employing joint shape/appearance models or employing global statistics.</p><p>6 0.55726689 <a title="269-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Pedestrian_Parsing_via_Deep_Decompositional_Network.html">311 iccv-2013-Pedestrian Parsing via Deep Decompositional Network</a></p>

One result is a clustering algorithm that is tuned to small codebooks but does not need all data in memory at the same time and is practically constant in the data size. As a by-product, a tree structure performs either exact or approximate quantization on trained centroids, the latter being not very precise but extremely fast. A lesser contribution is a new indexing scheme for image retrieval that exploits multiple small codebooks to provide an arbitrarily fine partition of the descriptor space. Large scale experiments on public datasets exhibit state of the art performance and remarkable generalization.</p><p>2 0.84324872 <a title="269-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Shufflets%3A_Shared_Mid-level_Parts_for_Fast_Object_Detection.html">390 iccv-2013-Shufflets: Shared Mid-level Parts for Fast Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Iasonas Kokkinos</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to identify and exploit structures that are shared across different object categories, by using sparse coding to learn a shared basis for the ‘part’ and ‘root’ templates of Deformable Part Models (DPMs). Our first contribution consists in using Shift-Invariant Sparse Coding (SISC) to learn mid-level elements that can translate during coding. This results in systematically better approximations than those attained using standard sparse coding. To emphasize that the learned mid-level structures are shiftable we call them shufflets. Our second contribution consists in using the resulting score to construct probabilistic upper bounds to the exact template scores, instead of taking them ‘at face value ’ as is common in current works. We integrate shufflets in DualTree Branch-and-Bound and cascade-DPMs and demonstrate that we can achieve a substantial acceleration, with practically no loss in performance.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.8112027 <a title="269-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Modeling_Occlusion_by_Discriminative_AND-OR_Structures.html">269 iccv-2013-Modeling Occlusion by Discriminative AND-OR Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Li, Wenze Hu, Tianfu Wu, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Occlusion presents a challenge for detecting objects in real world applications. To address this issue, this paper models object occlusion with an AND-OR structure which (i) represents occlusion at semantic part level, and (ii) captures the regularities of different occlusion configurations (i.e., the different combinations of object part visibilities). This paper focuses on car detection on street. Since annotating part occlusion on real images is time-consuming and error-prone, we propose to learn the the AND-OR structure automatically using synthetic images of CAD models placed at different relative positions. The model parameters are learned from real images under the latent structural SVM (LSSVM) framework. In inference, an efficient dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is utilized. In experiments, we test our method on both car detection and car view estimation. Experimental results show that (i) Our CAD simulation strategy is capable of generating occlusion patterns for real scenarios, (ii) The proposed AND-OR structure model is effective for modeling occlusions, which outperforms the deformable part-based model (DPM) [6, 10] in car detec- , tion on both our self-collected streetparking dataset and the Pascal VOC 2007 car dataset [4], (iii) The learned model is on-par with the state-of-the-art methods on car view estimation tested on two public datasets.</p><p>4 0.79729843 <a title="269-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Accurate_Blur_Models_vs._Image_Priors_in_Single_Image_Super-resolution.html">35 iccv-2013-Accurate Blur Models vs. Image Priors in Single Image Super-resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Netalee Efrat, Daniel Glasner, Alexander Apartsin, Boaz Nadler, Anat Levin</p><p>Abstract: Over the past decade, single image Super-Resolution (SR) research has focused on developing sophisticated image priors, leading to significant advances. Estimating and incorporating the blur model, that relates the high-res and low-res images, has received much less attention, however. In particular, the reconstruction constraint, namely that the blurred and downsampled high-res output should approximately equal the low-res input image, has been either ignored or applied with default fixed blur models. In this work, we examine the relative importance ofthe imageprior and the reconstruction constraint. First, we show that an accurate reconstruction constraint combined with a simple gradient regularization achieves SR results almost as good as those of state-of-the-art algorithms with sophisticated image priors. Second, we study both empirically and theoretically the sensitivity of SR algorithms to the blur model assumed in the reconstruction constraint. We find that an accurate blur model is more important than a sophisticated image prior. Finally, using real camera data, we demonstrate that the default blur models of various SR algorithms may differ from the camera blur, typically leading to over- smoothed results. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately estimating camera blur in reconstructing raw low- res images acquired by an actual camera.</p><p>5 0.79389644 <a title="269-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Image_Partitioning_Using_Decision_Trees_with_Structured_Split_Criteria.html">448 iccv-2013-Weakly Supervised Learning of Image Partitioning Using Decision Trees with Structured Split Criteria</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph Straehle, Ullrich Koethe, Fred A. Hamprecht</p><p>Abstract: We propose a scheme that allows to partition an image into a previously unknown number of segments, using only minimal supervision in terms of a few must-link and cannotlink annotations. We make no use of regional data terms, learning instead what constitutes a likely boundary between segments. Since boundaries are only implicitly specified through cannot-link constraints, this is a hard and nonconvex latent variable problem. We address this problem in a greedy fashion using a randomized decision tree on features associated with interpixel edges. We use a structured purity criterion during tree construction and also show how a backtracking strategy can be used to prevent the greedy search from ending up in poor local optima. The proposed strategy is compared with prior art on natural images.</p><p>6 0.79376048 <a title="269-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Adaptation_for_Personalized_Image_Search.html">52 iccv-2013-Attribute Adaptation for Personalized Image Search</a></p>

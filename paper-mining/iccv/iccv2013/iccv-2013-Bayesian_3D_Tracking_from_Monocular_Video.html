<p>Author: Aleksandr V. Segal, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel parametrization of the data association problem for multi-target tracking. In our formulation, the number of targets is implicitly inferred together with the data association, effectively solving data association and model selection as a single inference problem. The novel formulation allows us to interpret data association and tracking as a single Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS). We compute an approximate posterior solution to this problem using a dynamic programming/message passing technique. This inference-based approach allows us to incorporate richer probabilistic models into the tracking system. In particular, we incorporate inference over inliers/outliers and track termination times into the system. We evaluate our approach on publicly available datasets and demonstrate results competitive with, and in some cases exceeding the state of the art.</p><p>3 0.3288497 <a title="58-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Tracking_Revisited_Using_RGBD_Camera%3A_Unified_Benchmark_and_Baselines.html">424 iccv-2013-Tracking Revisited Using RGBD Camera: Unified Benchmark and Baselines</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuran Song, Jianxiong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Despite significant progress, tracking is still considered to be a very challenging task. Recently, the increasing popularity of depth sensors has made it possible to obtain reliable depth easily. This may be a game changer for tracking, since depth can be used to prevent model drift and handle occlusion. We also observe that current tracking algorithms are mostly evaluated on a very small number of videos collectedandannotated by different groups. The lack of a reasonable size and consistently constructed benchmark has prevented a persuasive comparison among different algorithms. In this paper, we construct a unified benchmark dataset of 100 RGBD videos with high diversity, propose different kinds of RGBD tracking algorithms using 2D or 3D model, and present a quantitative comparison of various algorithms with RGB or RGBD input. We aim to lay the foundation for further research in both RGB and RGBD tracking, and our benchmark is available at http://tracking.cs.princeton.edu.</p><p>4 0.3036544 <a title="58-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_People_Detectors_for_Tracking_in_Crowded_Scenes.html">242 iccv-2013-Learning People Detectors for Tracking in Crowded Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Siyu Tang, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Anton Milan, Konrad Schindler, Stefan Roth, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: People tracking in crowded real-world scenes is challenging due to frequent and long-term occlusions. Recent tracking methods obtain the image evidence from object (people) detectors, but typically use off-the-shelf detectors and treat them as black box components. In this paper we argue that for best performance one should explicitly train people detectors on failure cases of the overall tracker instead. To that end, we first propose a novel joint people detector that combines a state-of-the-art single person detector with a detector for pairs of people, which explicitly exploits common patterns of person-person occlusions across multiple viewpoints that are a frequent failure case for tracking in crowded scenes. To explicitly address remaining failure modes of the tracker we explore two methods. First, we analyze typical failures of trackers and train a detector explicitly on these cases. And second, we train the detector with the people tracker in the loop, focusing on the most common tracker failures. We show that our joint multi-person detector significantly improves both de- tection accuracy as well as tracker performance, improving the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks.</p><p>5 0.26891151 <a title="58-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Finding_the_Best_from_the_Second_Bests_-_Inhibiting_Subjective_Bias_in_Evaluation_of_Visual_Tracking_Algorithms.html">168 iccv-2013-Finding the Best from the Second Bests - Inhibiting Subjective Bias in Evaluation of Visual Tracking Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Pang, Haibin Ling</p><p>Abstract: Evaluating visual tracking algorithms, or “trackers ” for short, is of great importance in computer vision. However, it is hard to “fairly” compare trackers due to many parameters need to be tuned in the experimental configurations. On the other hand, when introducing a new tracker, a recent trend is to validate it by comparing it with several existing ones. Such an evaluation may have subjective biases towards the new tracker which typically performs the best. This is mainly due to the difficulty to optimally tune all its competitors and sometimes the selected testing sequences. By contrast, little subjective bias exists towards the “second best” ones1 in the contest. This observation inspires us with a novel perspective towards inhibiting subjective bias in evaluating trackers by analyzing the results between the second bests. In particular, we first collect all tracking papers published in major computer vision venues in recent years. From these papers, after filtering out potential biases in various aspects, we create a dataset containing many records of comparison results between various visual trackers. Using these records, we derive performance rank- ings of the involved trackers by four different methods. The first two methods model the dataset as a graph and then derive the rankings over the graph, one by a rank aggregation algorithm and the other by a PageRank-like solution. The other two methods take the records as generated from sports contests and adopt widely used Elo’s and Glicko ’s rating systems to derive the rankings. The experimental results are presented and may serve as a reference for related research.</p><p>6 0.25087294 <a title="58-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-PixelTrack%3A_A_Fast_Adaptive_Algorithm_for_Tracking_Non-rigid_Objects.html">318 iccv-2013-PixelTrack: A Fast Adaptive Algorithm for Tracking Non-rigid Objects</a></p>

<p>Author: Seunghoon Hong, Suha Kwak, Bohyung Han</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel offline tracking algorithm based on model-averaged posterior estimation through patch matching across frames. Contrary to existing online and offline tracking methods, our algorithm is not based on temporallyordered estimates of target state but attempts to select easyto-track frames first out of the remaining ones without exploiting temporal coherency of target. The posterior of the selected frame is estimated by propagating densities from the already tracked frames in a recursive manner. The density propagation across frames is implemented by an efficient patch matching technique, which is useful for our algorithm since it does not require motion smoothness assumption. Also, we present a hierarchical approach, where a small set of key frames are tracked first and non-key frames are handled by local key frames. Our tracking algorithm is conceptually well-suited for the sequences with abrupt motion, shot changes, and occlusion. We compare our tracking algorithm with existing techniques in real videos with such challenges and illustrate its superior performance qualitatively and quantitatively.</p><p>5 0.82487237 <a title="58-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Tracking_via_Robust_Multi-task_Multi-view_Joint_Sparse_Representation.html">425 iccv-2013-Tracking via Robust Multi-task Multi-view Joint Sparse Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhibin Hong, Xue Mei, Danil Prokhorov, Dacheng Tao</p><p>Abstract: Combining multiple observation views has proven beneficial for tracking. In this paper, we cast tracking as a novel multi-task multi-view sparse learning problem and exploit the cues from multiple views including various types of visual features, such as intensity, color, and edge, where each feature observation can be sparsely represented by a linear combination of atoms from an adaptive feature dictionary. The proposed method is integrated in a particle filter framework where every view in each particle is regarded as an individual task. We jointly consider the underlying relationship between tasks across different views and different particles, and tackle it in a unified robust multi-task formulation. In addition, to capture the frequently emerging outlier tasks, we decompose the representation matrix to two collaborative components which enable a more robust and accurate approximation. We show that theproposedformulation can be efficiently solved using the Accelerated Proximal Gradient method with a small number of closed-form updates. The presented tracker is implemented using four types of features and is tested on numerous benchmark video sequences. Both the qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to several stateof-the-art trackers.</p><p>6 0.81395787 <a title="58-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Network_Principles_for_SfM%3A_Disambiguating_Repeated_Structures_with_Local_Context.html">289 iccv-2013-Network Principles for SfM: Disambiguating Repeated Structures with Local Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Dan Xie, Sinisa Todorovic, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach to localizing functional objects in surveillance videos without domain knowledge about semantic object classes that may appear in the scene. Functional objects do not have discriminative appearance and shape, but they affect behavior of people in the scene. For example, they “attract” people to approach them for satisfying certain needs (e.g., vending machines could quench thirst), or “repel” people to avoid them (e.g., grass lawns). Therefore, functional objects can be viewed as “dark matter”, emanating “dark energy ” that affects people ’s trajectories in the video. To detect “dark matter” and infer their “dark energy ” field, we extend the Lagrangian mechanics. People are treated as particle-agents with latent intents to approach “dark matter” and thus satisfy their needs, where their motions are subject to a composite “dark energy ” field of all functional objects in the scene. We make the assumption that people take globally optimal paths toward the intended “dark matter” while avoiding latent obstacles. A Bayesian framework is used to probabilistically model: people ’s trajectories and intents, constraint map of the scene, and locations of functional objects. A data-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process is used for inference. Our evaluation on videos of public squares and courtyards demonstrates our effectiveness in localizing functional objects and predicting people ’s trajectories in unobserved parts of the video footage.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.83436143 <a title="58-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Bayesian_3D_Tracking_from_Monocular_Video.html">58 iccv-2013-Bayesian 3D Tracking from Monocular Video</a></p>

We develop a Bayesian modeling approach for tracking people in 3D from monocular video with unknown cameras. Modeling in 3D provides natural explanations for occlusions and smoothness discontinuities that result from projection, and allows priors on velocity and smoothness to be grounded in physical quantities: meters and seconds vs. pixels and frames. We pose the problem in the context of data association, in which observations are assigned to tracks. A correct application of Bayesian inference to multitarget tracking must address the fact that the model’s dimension changes as tracks are added or removed, and thus, posterior densities of different hypotheses are not comparable. We address this by marginalizing out the trajectory parameters so the resulting posterior over data associations has constant dimension. This is made tractable by using (a) Gaussian process priors for smooth trajectories and (b) approximately Gaussian likelihood functions. Our approach provides a principled method for incorporating multiple sources of evidence; we present results using both optical flow and object detector outputs. Results are comparable to recent work on 3D tracking and, unlike others, our method requires no pre-calibrated cameras.</p><p>3 0.83429581 <a title="58-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven_Efficiently-Sampled_Sparse_Graphical_Models_for_Concurrent_Tumor_Segmentation_and_Atlas_Registration.html">432 iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven Efficiently-Sampled Sparse Graphical Models for Concurrent Tumor Segmentation and Atlas Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Sarah Parisot, William Wells_III, Stéphane Chemouny, Hugues Duffau, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based methods have become popular in recent years and have successfully addressed tasks like segmentation and deformable registration. Their main strength is optimality of the obtained solution while their main limitation is the lack of precision due to the grid-like representations and the discrete nature of the quantized search space. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for combined segmentation/registration of brain tumors that adapts graph and sampling resolution according to the image content. To this end we estimate the segmentation and registration marginals towards adaptive graph resolution and intelligent definition of the search space. This information is considered in a hierarchical framework where uncertainties are propagated in a natural manner. State of the art results in the joint segmentation/registration of brain images with low-grade gliomas demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>4 0.77096134 <a title="58-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-How_Related_Exemplars_Help_Complex_Event_Detection_in_Web_Videos%3F.html">203 iccv-2013-How Related Exemplars Help Complex Event Detection in Web Videos?</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Yang, Zhigang Ma, Zhongwen Xu, Shuicheng Yan, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Compared to visual concepts such as actions, scenes and objects, complex event is a higher level abstraction of longer video sequences. For example, a “marriage proposal” event is described by multiple objects (e.g., ring, faces), scenes (e.g., in a restaurant, outdoor) and actions (e.g., kneeling down). The positive exemplars which exactly convey the precise semantic of an event are hard to obtain. It would be beneficial to utilize the related exemplars for complex event detection. However, the semantic correlations between related exemplars and the target event vary substantially as relatedness assessment is subjective. Two related exemplars can be about completely different events, e.g., in the TRECVID MED dataset, both bicycle riding and equestrianism are labeled as related to “attempting a bike trick” event. To tackle the subjectiveness of human assessment, our algorithm automatically evaluates how positive the related exemplars are for the detection of an event and uses them on an exemplar-specific basis. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is able to utilize related exemplars adaptively, and the algorithm gains good perform- z. ance for complex event detection.</p><p>5 0.75034475 <a title="58-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Alternating_Regression_Forests_for_Object_Detection_and_Pose_Estimation.html">47 iccv-2013-Alternating Regression Forests for Object Detection and Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel Schulter, Christian Leistner, Paul Wohlhart, Peter M. Roth, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: We present Alternating Regression Forests (ARFs), a novel regression algorithm that learns a Random Forest by optimizing a global loss function over all trees. This interrelates the information of single trees during the training phase and results in more accurate predictions. ARFs can minimize any differentiable regression loss without sacrificing the appealing properties of Random Forests, like low computational complexity during both, training and testing. Inspired by recent developments for classification [19], we derive a new algorithm capable of dealing with different regression loss functions, discuss its properties and investigate the relations to other methods like Boosted Trees. We evaluate ARFs on standard machine learning benchmarks, where we observe better generalization power compared to both standard Random Forests and Boosted Trees. Moreover, we apply the proposed regressor to two computer vision applications: object detection and head pose estimation from depth images. ARFs outperform the Random Forest baselines in both tasks, illustrating the importance of optimizing a common loss function for all trees.</p><p>6 0.73716259 <a title="58-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Object_Tracking_with_Online_Multi-lifespan_Dictionary_Learning.html">359 iccv-2013-Robust Object Tracking with Online Multi-lifespan Dictionary Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Renliang Weng, Jiwen Lu, Junlin Hu, Gao Yang, Yap-Peng Tan</p><p>Abstract: Over the past two decades, a number of face recognition methods have been proposed in the literature. Most of them use holistic face images to recognize people. However, human faces are easily occluded by other objects in many real-world scenarios and we have to recognize the person of interest from his/her partial faces. In this paper, we propose a new partial face recognition approach by using feature set matching, which is able to align partial face patches to holistic gallery faces automatically and is robust to occlusions and illumination changes. Given each gallery image and probe face patch, we first detect keypoints and extract their local features. Then, we propose a Metric Learned ExtendedRobust PointMatching (MLERPM) method to discriminatively match local feature sets of a pair of gallery and probe samples. Lastly, the similarity of two faces is converted as the distance between two feature sets. Experimental results on three public face databases are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><p>3 0.34560916 <a title="97-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Faces_Guided_Sparse_Many-to-One_Encoder_for_Pose-Invariant_Face_Recognition.html">335 iccv-2013-Random Faces Guided Sparse Many-to-One Encoder for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Yizhe Zhang, Ming Shao, Edward K. Wong, Yun Fu</p><p>Abstract: One of the most challenging task in face recognition is to identify people with varied poses. Namely, the test faces have significantly different poses compared with the registered faces. In this paper, we propose a high-level feature learning scheme to extract pose-invariant identity feature for face recognition. First, we build a single-hiddenlayer neural network with sparse constraint, to extractposeinvariant feature in a supervised fashion. Second, we further enhance the discriminative capability of the proposed feature by using multiple random faces as the target values for multiple encoders. By enforcing the target values to be uniquefor inputfaces over differentposes, the learned highlevel feature that is represented by the neurons in the hidden layer is pose free and only relevant to the identity information. Finally, we conduct face identification on CMU MultiPIE, and verification on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) databases, where identification rank-1 accuracy and face verification accuracy with ROC curve are reported. These experiments demonstrate that our model is superior to oth- er state-of-the-art approaches on handling pose variations.</p><p>4 0.24867338 <a title="97-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Sparse_Variation_Dictionary_Learning_for_Face_Recognition_with_a_Single_Training_Sample_per_Person.html">398 iccv-2013-Sparse Variation Dictionary Learning for Face Recognition with a Single Training Sample per Person</a></p>
<p>Author: Meng Yang, Luc Van_Gool, Lei Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Face recognition (FR) with a single training sample per person (STSPP) is a very challenging problem due to the lack of information to predict the variations in the query sample. Sparse representation based classification has shown interesting results in robust FR; however, its performance will deteriorate much for FR with STSPP. To address this issue, in this paper we learn a sparse variation dictionary from a generic training set to improve the query sample representation by STSPP. Instead of learning from the generic training set independently w.r.t. the gallery set, the proposed sparse variation dictionary learning (SVDL) method is adaptive to the gallery set by jointly learning a projection to connect the generic training set with the gallery set. The learnt sparse variation dictionary can be easily integrated into the framework of sparse representation based classification so that various variations in face images, including illumination, expression, occlusion, pose, etc., can be better handled. Experiments on the large-scale CMU Multi-PIE, FRGC and LFW databases demonstrate the promising performance of SVDL on FR with STSPP.</p><p>5 0.23909049 <a title="97-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-POP%3A_Person_Re-identification_Post-rank_Optimisation.html">305 iccv-2013-POP: Person Re-identification Post-rank Optimisation</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunxiao Liu, Chen Change Loy, Shaogang Gong, Guijin Wang</p><p>Abstract: Owing to visual ambiguities and disparities, person reidentification methods inevitably produce suboptimal ranklist, which still requires exhaustive human eyeballing to identify the correct target from hundreds of different likelycandidates. Existing re-identification studies focus on improving the ranking performance, but rarely look into the critical problem of optimising the time-consuming and error-prone post-rank visual search at the user end. In this study, we present a novel one-shot Post-rank OPtimisation (POP) method, which allows a user to quickly refine their search by either “one-shot” or a couple of sparse negative selections during a re-identification process. We conduct systematic behavioural studies to understand user’s searching behaviour and show that the proposed method allows correct re-identification to converge 2.6 times faster than the conventional exhaustive search. Importantly, through extensive evaluations we demonstrate that the method is capable of achieving significant improvement over the stateof-the-art distance metric learning based ranking models, even with just “one shot” feedback optimisation, by as much as over 30% performance improvement for rank 1reidentification on the VIPeR and i-LIDS datasets.</p><p>6 0.22679929 <a title="97-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Face_Detector_Training_Using_Tailored_Views.html">157 iccv-2013-Fast Face Detector Training Using Tailored Views</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuanjun Xiong, Wei Liu, Deli Zhao, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: The archetype hull model is playing an important role in large-scale data analytics and mining, but rarely applied to vision problems. In this paper, we migrate such a geometric model to address face recognition and verification together through proposing a unified archetype hull ranking framework. Upon a scalable graph characterized by a compact set of archetype exemplars whose convex hull encompasses most of the training images, the proposed framework explicitly captures the relevance between any query and the stored archetypes, yielding a rank vector over the archetype hull. The archetype hull ranking is then executed on every block of face images to generate a blockwise similarity measure that is achieved by comparing two different rank vectors with respect to the same archetype hull. After integrating blockwise similarity measurements with learned importance weights, we accomplish a sensible face similarity measure which can support robust and effective face recognition and verification. We evaluate the face similarity measure in terms of experiments performed on three benchmark face databases Multi-PIE, Pubfig83, and LFW, demonstrat- ing its performance superior to the state-of-the-arts.</p><p>5 0.72352672 <a title="97-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Hidden_Factor_Analysis_for_Age_Invariant_Face_Recognition.html">195 iccv-2013-Hidden Factor Analysis for Age Invariant Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Dihong Gong, Zhifeng Li, Dahua Lin, Jianzhuang Liu, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: Age invariant face recognition has received increasing attention due to its great potential in real world applications. In spite of the great progress in face recognition techniques, reliably recognizingfaces across ages remains a difficult task. The facial appearance of a person changes substantially over time, resulting in significant intra-class variations. Hence, the key to tackle this problem is to separate the variation caused by aging from the person-specific features that are stable. Specifically, we propose a new method, calledHidden FactorAnalysis (HFA). This methodcaptures the intuition above through a probabilistic model with two latent factors: an identity factor that is age-invariant and an age factor affected by the aging process. Then, the observed appearance can be modeled as a combination of the components generated based on these factors. We also develop a learning algorithm that jointly estimates the latent factors and the model parameters using an EM procedure. Extensive experiments on two well-known public domain face aging datasets: MORPH (the largest public face aging database) and FGNET, clearly show that the proposed method achieves notable improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><p>6 0.72316658 <a title="97-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Faces_Guided_Sparse_Many-to-One_Encoder_for_Pose-Invariant_Face_Recognition.html">335 iccv-2013-Random Faces Guided Sparse Many-to-One Encoder for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition</a></p>

A good hashing method should satisfy the following two requirements: 1) mapping the nearby data points into the same bucket or nearby (measured by xue long l i opt . ac . cn @ a(a)b(b) the Hamming distance) buckets. 2) all the data points are evenly distributed among all the buckets. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Complementary Projection Hashing (CPH) to find the optimal hashing functions which explicitly considers the above two requirements. Specifically, CPHaims at sequentiallyfinding a series ofhyperplanes (hashing functions) which cross the sparse region of the data. At the same time, the data points are evenly distributed in the hypercubes generated by these hyperplanes. The experiments comparing with the state-of-the-art hashing methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7584368 <a title="97-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Coupling_Alignments_with_Recognition_for_Still-to-Video_Face_Recognition.html">97 iccv-2013-Coupling Alignments with Recognition for Still-to-Video Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiwu Huang, Xiaowei Zhao, Shiguang Shan, Ruiping Wang, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: The Still-to-Video (S2V) face recognition systems typically need to match faces in low-quality videos captured under unconstrained conditions against high quality still face images, which is very challenging because of noise, image blur, lowface resolutions, varying headpose, complex lighting, and alignment difficulty. To address the problem, one solution is to select the frames of ‘best quality ’ from videos (hereinafter called quality alignment in this paper). Meanwhile, the faces in the selected frames should also be geometrically aligned to the still faces offline well-aligned in the gallery. In this paper, we discover that the interactions among the three tasks–quality alignment, geometric alignment and face recognition–can benefit from each other, thus should be performed jointly. With this in mind, we propose a Coupling Alignments with Recognition (CAR) method to tightly couple these tasks via low-rank regularized sparse representation in a unified framework. Our method makes the three tasks promote mutually by a joint optimization in an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier routine. Extensive , experiments on two challenging S2V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods impressively.</p><p>3 0.75429928 <a title="97-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Compensating_for_Motion_during_Direct-Global_Separation.html">82 iccv-2013-Compensating for Motion during Direct-Global Separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Supreeth Achar, Stephen T. Nuske, Srinivasa G. Narasimhan</p><p>Abstract: Separating the direct and global components of radiance can aid shape recovery algorithms and can provide useful information about materials in a scene. Practical methods for finding the direct and global components use multiple images captured under varying illumination patterns and require the scene, light source and camera to remain stationary during the image acquisition process. In this paper, we develop a motion compensation method that relaxes this condition and allows direct-global separation to beperformed on video sequences of dynamic scenes captured by moving projector-camera systems. Key to our method is being able to register frames in a video sequence to each other in the presence of time varying, high frequency active illumination patterns. We compare our motion compensated method to alternatives such as single shot separation and frame interleaving as well as ground truth. We present results on challenging video sequences that include various types of motions and deformations in scenes that contain complex materials like fabric, skin, leaves and wax.</p><p>4 0.73528248 <a title="97-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-DeepFlow%3A_Large_Displacement_Optical_Flow_with_Deep_Matching.html">105 iccv-2013-DeepFlow: Large Displacement Optical Flow with Deep Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Philippe Weinzaepfel, Jerome Revaud, Zaid Harchaoui, Cordelia Schmid</p><p>Abstract: Optical flow computation is a key component in many computer vision systems designed for tasks such as action detection or activity recognition. However, despite several major advances over the last decade, handling large displacement in optical flow remains an open problem. Inspired by the large displacement optical flow of Brox & Malik [6], our approach, termed DeepFlow, blends a matching algorithm with a variational approach for optical flow. We propose a descriptor matching algorithm, tailored to the optical flow problem, that allows to boost performance on fast motions. The matching algorithm builds upon a multi-stage architecture with 6 layers, interleaving convolutions and max-pooling, a construction akin to deep convolutional nets. Using dense sampling, it allows to efficiently retrieve quasi-dense correspondences, and enjoys a built-in smoothing effect on descriptors matches, a valuable assetfor integration into an energy minimizationframework for optical flow estimation. DeepFlow efficiently handles large displacements occurring in realistic videos, and shows competitive performance on optical flow benchmarks. Furthermore, it sets a new state-of-the-art on the MPI-Sintel dataset [8].</p><p>5 0.7235586 <a title="97-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-SIFTpack%3A_A_Compact_Representation_for_Efficient_SIFT_Matching.html">365 iccv-2013-SIFTpack: A Compact Representation for Efficient SIFT Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandra Gilinsky, Lihi Zelnik Manor</p><p>Abstract: Computing distances between large sets of SIFT descriptors is a basic step in numerous algorithms in computer vision. When the number of descriptors is large, as is often the case, computing these distances can be extremely time consuming. In this paper we propose the SIFTpack: a compact way of storing SIFT descriptors, which enables significantly faster calculations between sets of SIFTs than the current solutions. SIFTpack can be used to represent SIFTs densely extracted from a single image or sparsely from multiple different images. We show that the SIFTpack representation saves both storage space and run time, for both finding nearest neighbors and for computing all distances between all descriptors. The usefulness of SIFTpack is also demonstrated as an alternative implementation for K-means dictionaries of visual words.</p><p>6 0.70761275 <a title="97-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Pictorial_Human_Spaces%3A_How_Well_Do_Humans_Perceive_a_3D_Articulated_Pose%3F.html">316 iccv-2013-Pictorial Human Spaces: How Well Do Humans Perceive a 3D Articulated Pose?</a></p>

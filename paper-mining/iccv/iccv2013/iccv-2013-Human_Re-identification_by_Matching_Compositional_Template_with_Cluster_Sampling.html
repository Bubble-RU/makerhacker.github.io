<p>Author: Leonid Pishchulin, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Peter Gehler, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: Typical approaches to articulated pose estimation combine spatial modelling of the human body with appearance modelling of body parts. This paper aims to push the state-of-the-art in articulated pose estimation in two ways. First we explore various types of appearance representations aiming to substantially improve the bodypart hypotheses. And second, we draw on and combine several recently proposed powerful ideas such as more flexible spatial models as well as image-conditioned spatial models. In a series of experiments we draw several important conclusions: (1) we show that the proposed appearance representations are complementary; (2) we demonstrate that even a basic tree-structure spatial human body model achieves state-ofthe-art performance when augmented with the proper appearance representation; and (3) we show that the combination of the best performing appearance model with a flexible image-conditioned spatial model achieves the best result, significantly improving over the state of the art, on the “Leeds Sports Poses ” and “Parse ” benchmarks.</p><p>3 0.25104794 <a title="205-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminatively_Trained_Templates_for_3D_Object_Detection%3A_A_Real_Time_Scalable_Approach.html">121 iccv-2013-Discriminatively Trained Templates for 3D Object Detection: A Real Time Scalable Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Reyes Rios-Cabrera, Tinne Tuytelaars</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new method for detecting multiple specific 3D objects in real time. We start from the template-based approach based on the LINE2D/LINEMOD representation introduced recently by Hinterstoisser et al., yet extend it in two ways. First, we propose to learn the templates in a discriminative fashion. We show that this can be done online during the collection of the example images, in just a few milliseconds, and has a big impact on the accuracy of the detector. Second, we propose a scheme based on cascades that speeds up detection. Since detection of an object is fast, new objects can be added with very low cost, making our approach scale well. In our experiments, we easily handle 10-30 3D objects at frame rates above 10fps using a single CPU core. We outperform the state-of-the-art both in terms of speed as well as in terms of accuracy, as validated on 3 different datasets. This holds both when using monocular color images (with LINE2D) and when using RGBD images (with LINEMOD). Moreover, wepropose a challenging new dataset made of12 objects, for future competing methods on monocular color images.</p><p>4 0.22815932 <a title="205-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Object_Tracking_with_Online_Multi-lifespan_Dictionary_Learning.html">359 iccv-2013-Robust Object Tracking with Online Multi-lifespan Dictionary Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Junliang Xing, Jin Gao, Bing Li, Weiming Hu, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: Recently, sparse representation has been introduced for robust object tracking. By representing the object sparsely, i.e., using only a few templates via ?1-norm minimization, these so-called ?1-trackers exhibit promising tracking results. In this work, we address the object template building and updating problem in these ?1-tracking approaches, which has not been fully studied. We propose to perform template updating, in a new perspective, as an online incremental dictionary learning problem, which is efficiently solved through an online optimization procedure. To guarantee the robustness and adaptability of the tracking algorithm, we also propose to build a multi-lifespan dictionary model. By building target dictionaries of different lifespans, effective object observations can be obtained to deal with the well-known drifting problem in tracking and thus improve the tracking accuracy. We derive effective observa- tion models both generatively and discriminatively based on the online multi-lifespan dictionary learning model and deploy them to the Bayesian sequential estimation framework to perform tracking. The proposed approach has been extensively evaluated on ten challenging video sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the online learned templates, as well as the state-of-the-art tracking performance of the proposed approach.</p><p>5 0.16606054 <a title="205-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Cosegmentation_and_Cosketch_by_Unsupervised_Learning.html">95 iccv-2013-Cosegmentation and Cosketch by Unsupervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jifeng Dai, Ying Nian Wu, Jie Zhou, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Cosegmentation refers to theproblem ofsegmenting multiple images simultaneously by exploiting the similarities between the foreground and background regions in these images. The key issue in cosegmentation is to align common objects between these images. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised learning framework for cosegmentation, by coupling cosegmentation with what we call “cosketch ”. The goal of cosketch is to automatically discover a codebook of deformable shape templates shared by the input images. These shape templates capture distinct image patterns and each template is matched to similar image patches in different images. Thus the cosketch of the images helps to align foreground objects, thereby providing crucial information for cosegmentation. We present a statistical model whose energy function couples cosketch and cosegmentation. We then present an unsupervised learning algorithm that performs cosketch and cosegmentation by energy minimization. Experiments show that our method outperforms state of the art methods for cosegmentation on the challenging MSRC and iCoseg datasets. We also illustrate our method on a new dataset called Coseg-Rep where cosegmentation can be performed within a single image with repetitive patterns.</p><p>6 0.15107766 <a title="205-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Graph_Matching%3A_Oriented_to_Category_Modeling_from_Cluttered_Scenes.html">237 iccv-2013-Learning Graph Matching: Oriented to Category Modeling from Cluttered Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Fares Alnajar, Theo Gevers, Roberto Valenti, Sennay Ghebreab</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method to auto-calibrate gaze estimators based on gaze patterns obtained from other viewers. Our method is based on the observation that the gaze patterns of humans are indicative of where a new viewer will look at [12]. When a new viewer is looking at a stimulus, we first estimate a topology of gaze points (initial gaze points). Next, these points are transformed so that they match the gaze patterns of other humans to find the correct gaze points. In a flexible uncalibrated setup with a web camera and no chin rest, the proposed method was tested on ten subjects and ten images. The method estimates the gaze points after looking at a stimulus for a few seconds with an average accuracy of 4.3◦. Although the reported performance is lower than what could be achieved with dedicated hardware or calibrated setup, the proposed method still provides a sufficient accuracy to trace the viewer attention. This is promising considering the fact that auto-calibration is done in a flexible setup , without the use of a chin rest, and based only on a few seconds of gaze initialization data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use human gaze patterns in order to auto-calibrate gaze estimators.</p><p>6 0.59718317 <a title="205-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Object_Tracking_with_Online_Multi-lifespan_Dictionary_Learning.html">359 iccv-2013-Robust Object Tracking with Online Multi-lifespan Dictionary Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Marius Leordeanu, Andrei Zanfir, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Estimating a dense correspondence field between successive video frames, under large displacement, is important in many visual learning and recognition tasks. We propose a novel sparse-to-dense matching method for motion field estimation and occlusion detection. As an alternative to the current coarse-to-fine approaches from the optical flow literature, we start from the higher level of sparse matching with rich appearance and geometric constraints collected over extended neighborhoods, using an occlusion aware, locally affine model. Then, we move towards the simpler, but denser classic flow field model, with an interpolation procedure that offers a natural transition between the sparse and the dense correspondence fields. We experimentally demonstrate that our appearance features and our complex geometric constraintspermit the correct motion estimation even in difficult cases of large displacements and significant appearance changes. We also propose a novel classification method for occlusion detection that works in conjunction with the sparse-to-dense matching model. We validate our approach on the newly released Sintel dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.87244332 <a title="205-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Human_Re-identification_by_Matching_Compositional_Template_with_Cluster_Sampling.html">205 iccv-2013-Human Re-identification by Matching Compositional Template with Cluster Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuanlu Xu, Liang Lin, Wei-Shi Zheng, Xiaobai Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims at a newly raising task in visual surveillance: re-identifying people at a distance by matching body information, given several reference examples. Most of existing works solve this task by matching a reference template with the target individual, but often suffer from large human appearance variability (e.g. different poses/views, illumination) and high false positives in matching caused by conjunctions, occlusions or surrounding clutters. Addressing these problems, we construct a simple yet expressive template from a few reference images of a certain individual, which represents the body as an articulated assembly of compositional and alternative parts, and propose an effective matching algorithm with cluster sampling. This algorithm is designed within a candidacy graph whose vertices are matching candidates (i.e. a pair of source and target body parts), and iterates in two steps for convergence. (i) It generates possible partial matches based on compatible and competitive relations among body parts. (ii) It con- firms the partial matches to generate a new matching solution, which is accepted by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mechanism. In the experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on three public databases compared to existing methods.</p><p>3 0.8723343 <a title="205-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Target-Driven_Moire_Pattern_Synthesis_by_Phase_Modulation.html">413 iccv-2013-Target-Driven Moire Pattern Synthesis by Phase Modulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Pei-Hen Tsai, Yung-Yu Chuang</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates an approach for generating two grating images so that the moir e´ pattern of their superposition resembles the target image. Our method is grounded on the fundamental moir e´ theorem. By focusing on the visually most dominant (1, −1)-moir e´ component, we obtain the phase smto ddoumlaintiaonnt c (o1n,s−tr1a)in-mt on the phase shifts bee otwbteaeinn the two grating images. For improving visual appearance of the grating images and hiding capability the embedded image, a smoothness term is added to spread information between the two grating images and an appearance phase function is used to add irregular structures into grating images. The grating images can be printed on transparencies and the hidden image decoding can be performed optically by overlaying them together. The proposed method enables the creation of moir e´ art and allows visual decoding without computers.</p><p>4 0.8646642 <a title="205-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Slice_Sampling_Particle_Belief_Propagation.html">395 iccv-2013-Slice Sampling Particle Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Oliver Müller, Michael Ying Yang, Bodo Rosenhahn</p><p>Abstract: Inference in continuous label Markov random fields is a challenging task. We use particle belief propagation (PBP) for solving the inference problem in continuous label space. Sampling particles from the belief distribution is typically done by using Metropolis-Hastings (MH) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods which involves sampling from a proposal distribution. This proposal distribution has to be carefully designed depending on the particular model and input data to achieve fast convergence. We propose to avoid dependence on a proposal distribution by introducing a slice sampling based PBP algorithm. The proposed approach shows superior convergence performance on an image denoising toy example. Our findings are validated on a challenging relational 2D feature tracking application.</p><p>5 0.85724884 <a title="205-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Constant_Time_Weighted_Median_Filtering_for_Stereo_Matching_and_Beyond.html">88 iccv-2013-Constant Time Weighted Median Filtering for Stereo Matching and Beyond</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziyang Ma, Kaiming He, Yichen Wei, Jian Sun, Enhua Wu</p><p>Abstract: Despite the continuous advances in local stereo matching for years, most efforts are on developing robust cost computation and aggregation methods. Little attention has been seriously paid to the disparity refinement. In this work, we study weighted median filtering for disparity refinement. We discover that with this refinement, even the simple box filter aggregation achieves comparable accuracy with various sophisticated aggregation methods (with the same refinement). This is due to the nice weighted median filtering properties of removing outlier error while respecting edges/structures. This reveals that the previously overlooked refinement can be at least as crucial as aggregation. We also develop the first constant time algorithmfor the previously time-consuming weighted median filter. This makes the simple combination “box aggregation + weighted median ” an attractive solution in practice for both speed and accuracy. As a byproduct, the fast weighted median filtering unleashes its potential in other applications that were hampered by high complexities. We show its superiority in various applications such as depth upsampling, clip-art JPEG artifact removal, and image stylization.</p><p>6 0.85621554 <a title="205-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Image_Partitioning_Using_Decision_Trees_with_Structured_Split_Criteria.html">448 iccv-2013-Weakly Supervised Learning of Image Partitioning Using Decision Trees with Structured Split Criteria</a></p>

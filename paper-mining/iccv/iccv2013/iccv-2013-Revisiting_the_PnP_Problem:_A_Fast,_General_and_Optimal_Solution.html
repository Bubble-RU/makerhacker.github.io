</p><p>6 Introduction  Given n (n ≥ 3) 3D reference points in the object framewoGrki vaennd nth (enir ≥ corresponding c2eD p projections, tboj edcette frrammineethe orientation and position of a fully calibrated perspective camera is known as the perspective-n-point (PnP) problem [9]. [sent-16, score-0.12]
</p><p>7 Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a fast (preferably, real-time) and globally optimal solution, which is accurate and applicable to a PnP problem with any point number n (n ≥ 3), any 3eD to point configuration tahn dan arbitrary camera pose. [sent-19, score-0.218]
</p><p>8 To properly account for the latest progress, we would like to roughly categorize them into two groups - the multi-stage methods and the direct minimization methods. [sent-25, score-0.113]
</p><p>9 Typically, the multi-stage methods first estimate the coordinates of some (or all) points in the camera framework, and transform the PnP problem into the 3D-3D absolute pose problem, for which there exist closed-form solution-  s [2 1]. [sent-26, score-0.125]
</p><p>10 Without estimating point coordinates, the well-known direct linear transformation (DLT) method [9] is also a multi-stage method, since it first determines the projection matrix and then extracts the calibration parameters and the camera pose. [sent-36, score-0.143]
</p><p>11 In contrast, the direct minimization methods are characteristic of minimizing a properly defined error function, either in the image space or the object space, while taking into consideration all nonlinear constraints. [sent-41, score-0.19]
</p><p>12 It is widely known that minimizing the reprojection error is the best criterion, which leads to a challenging nonconvex fractional programming problem. [sent-42, score-0.189]
</p><p>13 As a trade off, some direct minimization methods [6, 16] minimize instead certain algebraic error functions via local optimization techniques. [sent-46, score-0.256]
</p><p>14 [6] offered an alternating minimization method to minimize an algebraic error defined in the image space. [sent-49, score-0.202]
</p><p>15 The above direct minimization methods [6, 16, 17, 20] share another shortage that they return only a single solution, which might not correspond to the true camera pose in case of multiple solutions. [sent-55, score-0.235]
</p><p>16 To resolve these drawbacks, Hesch and Roumeliotis [10] developed a direct least square (DLS) method with complexity O(n), in which all stationary points are retrieved by solving the polynomial system derived from its first-order optimal condition via the resultant technique. [sent-56, score-0.419]
</p><p>17 Unfortunately, they parameterized rotation by using the Cayley representation, which is degenerate in all cases of 180 degree rotations around the x-, y- and z-axis1 . [sent-57, score-0.13]
</p><p>18 The accuracy deteriorates seriously when the camera pose approaches these singularities. [sent-58, score-0.088]
</p><p>19 As pointed out in [ 15], in addition to the number of points n, the configuration of the 3D reference points plays 1On the project page, Hesch and Roumeliotis provided a remedy by solving DLS three times under different rotated 3D points. [sent-59, score-0.262]
</p><p>20 A desirable PnP solution should be able to handle all 3D point configurations, including  the ordinary-3D, the planar and the quasi-singular (nearplanar or near-linear) configuration. [sent-63, score-0.198]
</p><p>21 However, some existing methods, like [ 14, 20], handle the ordinary-3D and the planar configuration separately, thus tend to be inaccurate in the in-between quasi-singular case. [sent-64, score-0.168]
</p><p>22 Overview of the Proposed Solution In this paper, we propose the first non-iterative O(n) solution that is fast, globally optimal and universally applicable. [sent-68, score-0.149]
</p><p>23 Our basic idea is to formulate the PnP problem into a minimization problem and retrieve all its stationary points by using the Gr¨ obner basis technique. [sent-69, score-0.342]
</p><p>24 By using a unusual non-unit quaternion representation to parameterize rotation, we formulate the PnP problem into an unconstrained optimization problem. [sent-71, score-0.284]
</p><p>25 The polynomial system arising from its first-order optimality condition is simpler than using the standard unit quaternion parameterization. [sent-72, score-0.588]
</p><p>26 More interestingly, this polynomial system is of odd-degree, thus assuming two-fold symmetry, a nice property that can be utilized to improve speed and numerical stability of a Gr¨ obner basis solver. [sent-73, score-0.467]
</p><p>27 Being globally optimal, our proposed solution successfully conquers the problem of local optimality (or even divergence) that might upset a local optimization based method. [sent-74, score-0.223]
</p><p>28 Unlike [10], our solution does not suffer from any degeneracy of camera pose. [sent-76, score-0.188]
</p><p>29 Experiment results have demonstrated that, in terms of accuracy, our proposed solution is definitely better than the examined state-of-the-art methods. [sent-77, score-0.121]
</p><p>30 Actually, although our cost function is only algebraically meaningful, its accuracy is even comparable to that of the reprojection error minimization method. [sent-78, score-0.255]
</p><p>31 Therefore, the proposed solution is universally applicable to any PnP problem, irrespective of the 3D point configuration, the camera pose and the number of points. [sent-81, score-0.27]

</p><p>34 Considering that the perspective camera has been calibrated, we simply assume that the projections pi are measured in the normalized homogeneous image coordinate framework. [sent-96, score-0.098]
</p><p>35 Rotation Parameterization A critical issue is how to parameterize the rotation matrix R, such that the orthonormal constraint RRT = I and the determinant constraint det(R) = 1could be satisfied. [sent-100, score-0.157]
</p><p>36 There are various parameterization methods for R, such as the Euler angle, rotation axis-angle, Cayley and unit quaternion parameterization. [sent-101, score-0.404]
</p><p>37 To facilitate global optimization via polynomial system solving, we advocate instead the non-unit quaternion parameterization, which is free of any trigonometric function. [sent-102, score-0.439]
</p><p>38 Specifically, letting s = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2, the non-unit quaternion parameterization reads  R =1s⎢⎡⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢a2 +2b bcd2+− 2c2a2a−cd 2 a2−2 bcbcd2+ −c2 2a db−d2 a2 −2cb d 2− +2 ca 2cb+d2⎥ ⎥ ⎥⎤⎥ ⎥,(2)  where a, b, c, d are the four unknown parameters. [sent-103, score-0.35]
</p><p>39 It⎦ is straightforward to verify that the parameterization in Eq. [sent-104, score-0.109]
</p><p>40 and At first sight, the above parameterization is unattractive at all. [sent-106, score-0.109]
</p><p>41 It is possible to exploit this property to resolve the concerns on the non-unit quaternion representation. [sent-116, score-0.196]
</p><p>42 Although it is only an algebraic error, as will be demonstrated in the experiment section, its accuracy is very close to that of minimizing the reprojection error, i. [sent-156, score-0.147]
</p><p>43 In addition, it suffers from no degeneracy of camera pose, and is independent of the 3D point configuration. [sent-167, score-0.147]
</p><p>44 Relation to Existing Works In the previous section, we have used the non-unit quaternion to parameterize the rotation, and fixed its scale by using the reciprocal of the average depth. [sent-170, score-0.284]
</p><p>45 Through some basic operations, one can verify that the Cayley parameterization is the same as R(1, b, c, d), that is, fixing the  scale of Eq. [sent-182, score-0.109]
</p><p>46 The major advantage lies in that the polynomial system in [ 10] is simpler to solve, since there remain only three variables. [sent-184, score-0.2]
</p><p>47 Here, we prefer to solve the polynomial system of the first-order optimality condition of Eq. [sent-189, score-0.317]
</p><p>48 The investigated solvers include the blind GB solver without utilizing symmetry (Blind GB), the GB solver using two-fold symmetry (Symmetric GB), the Symmetric GB followed by one damped  Newton polishing step (Symmetric GB + Polish) and the resultant based solver used in DLS [10]. [sent-207, score-0.725]
</p><p>49 The horizontal axis shows the log10 value of the absolute error between the ground-truth unitnorm quaternion and the estimated quaternion after normalization, while the vertical axis shows the counts over 5,000 independent runs. [sent-210, score-0.469]
</p><p>50 (1 1) with respect to a, b, c, d, the first-order optimality condition reads  ∂∂af= 0,∂∂bf= 0,∂∂cf= 0,∂∂df= 0,  (13)  which is composed of four three-degree polynomials with respect to a, b, c, d. [sent-213, score-0.209]
</p><p>51 A Blind Gr¨ obner  Basis Solver  Although solving multivariate polynomial systems is challenging in general, the multiview geometry community has achieved much progress by means of the Gr¨ obner basis (GB) technique [3]. [sent-216, score-0.446]
</p><p>52 [13] even developed an automatic generator of GB solvers, which facilitates the solving of polynomial systems arising from geometric computer vision problems. [sent-218, score-0.292]

</p><p>63 By using symmetry, the size of the elimination template and that of the action matrix could be drastically reduced, which in return improves computational speed and numerical stability. [sent-248, score-0.154]

<p>Author: Yubin Kuang, Kalle Åström</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the geometry problems of estimating camera pose with unknown focal length using combination of geometric primitives. We consider points, lines and also rich features such as quivers, i.e. points with one or more directions. We formulate the problems as polynomial systems where the constraints for different primitives are handled in a unified way. We develop efficient polynomial solvers for each of the derived cases with different combinations of primitives. The availability of these solvers enables robust pose estimation with unknown focal length for wider classes of features.

<p>Author: Zuzana Kukelova, Martin Bujnak, Tomas Pajdla</p><p>Abstract: Theproblem ofdetermining the absoluteposition andorientation of a camera from a set of 2D-to-3D point correspondences is one of the most important problems in computer vision with a broad range of applications. In this paper we present a new solution to the absolute pose problem for camera with unknown radial distortion and unknown focal length from five 2D-to-3D point correspondences. Our new solver is numerically more stable, more accurate, and significantly faster than the existing state-of-the-art minimal fourpoint absolutepose solvers for this problem. Moreover, our solver results in less solutions and can handle larger radial distortions. The new solver is straightforward and uses only simple concepts from linear algebra. Therefore it is simpler than the state-of-the-art Gr¨ obner basis solvers. We compare our new solver with the existing state-of-theart solvers and show its usefulness on synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>4 0.17289402 <a title="353-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Kneip, Simon Lynen</p><p>Abstract: This work makes use of a novel, recently proposed epipolar constraint for computing the relative pose between two calibrated images. By enforcing the coplanarity of epipolar plane normal vectors, it constrains the three degrees of freedom of the relative rotation between two camera views directly—independently of the translation. The present paper shows how the approach can be extended to n points, and translated into an efficient eigenvalue minimization over the three rotational degrees of freedom. Each iteration in the non-linear optimization has constant execution time, independently of the number of features. Two global optimization approaches are proposed. The first one consists of an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt scheme with randomized initial value, which already leads to stable and accurate results. The second scheme consists of a globally optimal branch-and-bound algorithm based on a bound on the eigenvalue variation derived from symmetric eigenvalue-perturbation theory. Analysis of the cost function reveals insights into the nature of a specific relative pose problem, and outlines the complexity under different conditions. The algorithm shows state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. essential-matrix based solutions, and a frameto-frame application to a video sequence immediately leads to an alternative, real-time visual odometry solution.

<p>Author: Xiaochun Cao, Hua Zhang, Si Liu, Xiaojie Guo, Liang Lin</p><p>Abstract: Recently, studies on sketch, such as sketch retrieval and sketch classification, have received more attention in the computer vision community. One of its most fundamental and essential problems is how to more effectively describe a sketch image. Many existing descriptors, such as shape context, have achieved great success. In this paper, we propose a new descriptor, namely Symmetric-aware Flip Invariant Sketch Histogram (SYM-FISH) to refine the shape context feature. Its extraction process includes three steps. First the Flip Invariant Sketch Histogram (FISH) descriptor is extracted on the input image, which is a flip-invariant version of the shape context feature. Then we explore the symmetry character of the image by calculating the kurtosis coefficient. Finally, the SYM-FISH is generated by constructing a symmetry table. The new SYM-FISH descriptor supplements the original shape context by encoding the symmetric information, which is a pervasive characteristic of natural scene and objects. We evaluate the efficacy of the novel descriptor in two applications, i.e., sketch retrieval and sketch classification. Extensive experiments on three datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed SYM-FISH descriptor.</p><p>6 0.088210665 <a title="353-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_Global_Linear_Method_for_Camera_Pose_Registration.html">17 iccv-2013-A Global Linear Method for Camera Pose Registration</a></p>

The novelty lies in a non-unit quaternion representation to parameterize the rotation and a simple but elegant formulation of the PnP problem into an unconstrained optimization problem. Interestingly, the polynomial system arising from its first-order optimality condition assumes two-fold symmetry, a nice property that can be utilized to improve speed and numerical stability of a Gr¨ obner basis solver.

We consider points, lines and also rich features such as quivers, i.e. points with one or more directions. We formulate the problems as polynomial systems where the constraints for different primitives are handled in a unified way. We develop efficient polynomial solvers for each of the derived cases with different combinations of primitives. The availability of these solvers enables robust pose estimation with unknown focal length for wider classes of features. Such rich features allow for fewer feature correspondences and generate larger inlier sets with higher probability.

<p>Author: Adrien Bartoli, Daniel Pizarro, Toby Collins</p><p>Abstract: We study the uncalibrated isometric Shape-fromTemplate problem, that consists in estimating an isometric deformation from a template shape to an input image whose focal length is unknown. Our method is the first that combines the following features: solving for both the 3D deformation and the camera ’s focal length, involving only local analytical solutions (there is no numerical optimization), being robust to mismatches, handling general surfaces and running extremely fast. This was achieved through two key steps. First, an ‘uncalibrated’ 3D deformation is computed thanks to a novel piecewise weak-perspective projection model. Second, the camera’s focal length is estimated and enables upgrading the 3D deformation to metric. We use a variational framework, implemented using a smooth function basis and sampled local deformation models. The only degeneracy which we easily detect– for focal length estimation is a flat and fronto-parallel surface. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets show that our method achieves a 3D shape accuracy – slightly below state of the art methods using a precalibrated or the true focal length, and a focal length accuracy slightly below static calibration methods.</p><p>5 0.79942364 <a title="353-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>

<p>Author: Tobias Weyand, Bastian Leibe</p><p>Abstract: Current landmark recognition engines are typically aimed at recognizing building-scale landmarks, but miss interesting details like portals, statues or windows. This is because they use a flat clustering that summarizes all photos of a building facade in one cluster. We propose Hierarchical Iconoid Shift, a novel landmark clustering algorithm capable of discovering such details. Instead of just a collection of clusters, the output of HIS is a set of dendrograms describing the detail hierarchy of a landmark. HIS is based on the novel Hierarchical Medoid Shift clustering algorithm that performs a continuous mode search over the complete scale space. HMS is completely parameter-free, has the same complexity as Medoid Shift and is easy to parallelize. We evaluate HIS on 800k images of 34 landmarks and show that it can extract an often surprising amount of detail and structure that can be applied, e.g., to provide a mobile user with more detailed information on a landmark or even to extend the landmark’s Wikipedia article.</p><p>3 0.71230567 <a title="353-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-No_Matter_Where_You_Are%3A_Flexible_Graph-Guided_Multi-task_Learning_for_Multi-view_Head_Pose_Classification_under_Target_Motion.html">291 iccv-2013-No Matter Where You Are: Flexible Graph-Guided Multi-task Learning for Multi-view Head Pose Classification under Target Motion</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Yan, Elisa Ricci, Ramanathan Subramanian, Oswald Lanz, Nicu Sebe</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel Multi-Task Learning framework (FEGA-MTL) for classifying the head pose of a person who moves freely in an environment monitored by multiple, large field-of-view surveillance cameras. As the target (person) moves, distortions in facial appearance owing to camera perspective and scale severely impede performance of traditional head pose classification methods. FEGA-MTL operates on a dense uniform spatial grid and learns appearance relationships across partitions as well as partition-specific appearance variations for a given head pose to build region-specific classifiers. Guided by two graphs which a-priori model appearance similarity among (i) grid partitions based on camera geometry and (ii) head pose classes, the learner efficiently clusters appearancewise related grid partitions to derive the optimal partitioning. For pose classification, upon determining the target’s position using a person tracker, the appropriate regionspecific classifier is invoked. Experiments confirm that FEGA-MTL achieves state-of-the-art classification with few training data.</p><p>4 0.71052682 <a title="353-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Direct_Super-Resolution_by_Simple_Functions.html">156 iccv-2013-Fast Direct Super-Resolution by Simple Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Chih-Yuan Yang, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: The goal of single-image super-resolution is to generate a high-quality high-resolution image based on a given low-resolution input. It is an ill-posed problem which requires exemplars or priors to better reconstruct the missing high-resolution image details. In this paper, we propose to split the feature space into numerous subspaces and collect exemplars to learn priors for each subspace, thereby creating effective mapping functions. The use of split input space facilitates both feasibility of using simple functionsfor super-resolution, and efficiency ofgenerating highresolution results. High-quality high-resolution images are reconstructed based on the effective learned priors. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed algorithmperforms efficiently and effectively over state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.71037024 <a title="353-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Set_Classification_Using_Holistic_Multiple_Order_Statistics_Features_and_Localized_Multi-kernel_Metric_Learning.html">212 iccv-2013-Image Set Classification Using Holistic Multiple Order Statistics Features and Localized Multi-kernel Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiwen Lu, Gang Wang, Pierre Moulin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for image set classification, where each training and testing example contains a set of image instances of an object captured from varying viewpoints or under varying illuminations. While a number of image set classification methods have been proposed in recent years, most of them model each image set as a single linear subspace or mixture of linear subspaces, which may lose some discriminative information for classification. To address this, we propose exploring multiple order statistics as features of image sets, and develop a localized multikernel metric learning (LMKML) algorithm to effectively combine different order statistics information for classification. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four widely used databases including the Honda/UCSD, CMU Mobo, and Youtube face datasets, and the ETH-80 object dataset.</p><p>6 0.70850235 <a title="353-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_Salient_Region_Detection_with_Soft_Image_Abstraction.html">137 iccv-2013-Efficient Salient Region Detection with Soft Image Abstraction</a></p>

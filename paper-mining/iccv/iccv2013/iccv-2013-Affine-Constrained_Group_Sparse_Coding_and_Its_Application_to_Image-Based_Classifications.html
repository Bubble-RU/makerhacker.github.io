</p><p>7 The proposed affineconstrained group sparse coding (ACGSC) model aims to further improve the effectiveness of SRC by addressing two of these shortcomings: its generalizability and its extension for multiple input images. [sent-35, score-0.712]
</p><p>8 Therefore, there is a need to properly generalize SRC for classification problems that require decision on a group of test data x1, . [sent-38, score-0.42]

</p><p>13 The matrix C of sparse coefficients can be used as in SRC to generate classification decision by applying voting or pooling across its rows. [sent-66, score-0.482]
</p><p>14 For classification problems in computer vision, this pa-  per argues that a generalization of the group sparse coding, affine-constrained group sparse coding, using the following objective function, offers a more principled and flexible approach: E(a, c; X, D) = ? [sent-68, score-0.916]

</p><p>16 (2), the ACGSC enlarges its feasible domain by including a kdimensional vector a. [sent-79, score-0.171]
</p><p>17 However, the feature vector c used in classification is in fact a vector not a matrix, and comparing with GSC, the classification decision based on Eq. [sent-80, score-0.252]

</p><p>19 xk that can best be sparse coded using the dictionary D. [sent-85, score-0.431]
</p><p>20 From classification viewpoint, ACGSC benefits from multiple inputs by using a linear generative model to “align” the test images with the dictionary elements. [sent-86, score-0.319]
</p><p>21 For example, if the test (face) images were taken under illumination conditions that are very different from the ones for the dictionary elements, sparse coding test images individually or in group can be expected to provide poor classification results. [sent-87, score-1.086]
</p><p>22 Heuristically, this can be explained as a kind of generalized misalignment (in terms of illumination effects) between the training and test images. [sent-88, score-0.218]
</p><p>23 For ACGSC, the coefficient a is used to “align” the test images with the dictionary el-  ements, and it is precisely this online “alignment” of the input images xi that provides ACGSC with an edge over other SRC methods. [sent-89, score-0.339]
</p><p>24 Second, in most applications, the linear generative model given by Xa is valid only for restricted a, and the nonnegative affine constraint proposed here is sufficiently general to provide a bounded and tractable domain for efficient optimization. [sent-93, score-0.275]
</p><p>25 We remark that for image-based applications, the test images xi have nonnegative intensity values, and therefore, their convex hull would never contain the zero vector (i. [sent-94, score-0.576]
</p><p>26 Likewise, for a typical group of data xi, their convex hull will not contain the zero vector. [sent-97, score-0.486]
</p><p>27 The argument in favor of affine-constrained group sparse coding relies mainly on a form of sparse recovery guarantee presented in Theorem 1below. [sent-100, score-0.895]
</p><p>28 We propose a novel sparse representation-based classification framework based on affine-constrained group sparse coding, and it provides a principled extension  of the current SRC framework to classification problems with multiple input samples. [sent-104, score-0.946]

</p><p>35 A schematic illustration of the difference between the group sparse coding and our constrained version is shown in Fig. [sent-124, score-0.69]
</p><p>36 The GSC-based classification scheme sparse codes the input feature vectors xi simultaneously. [sent-126, score-0.399]
</p><p>37 While some group sparsity can be claimed for this approach based on the appropriate regularizer Ψ, it is generally difficult to provide any guarantee on the behavior of the sparse coefficient matrix C. [sent-127, score-0.523]
</p><p>38 On the other hand, for our constrained version, the discrete set of the input vectors has been completed to form a convex set S, and our approach is designed to capture any vector in this convex set that can best be sparse coded by the dictionary D. [sent-128, score-0.74]
</p><p>39 The situation here shares some similarity with the LP-relaxation of integer programming [24] or the convexification of a non- convex program [18], in which one enlarges the feasible domain in order to achieve convexity and thereby, efficiently compute approximate solution. [sent-129, score-0.302]
</p><p>40 It is clear that the optimization problem is indeed convex and it is completely tractable as the feasible domain and objective function are both convex. [sent-132, score-0.256]
</p><p>41 The only complication is the projection onto the simplex defined by the group co-  (? [sent-134, score-0.202]

</p><p>45 None of the xi lie within the subspace; however some of the points on the convex hull do and the proposed algorithm is designed to capture these points. [sent-142, score-0.34]
</p><p>46 Theoretical Guarantee Given a dictionary D, a vector x has sparsity s if it can be written exactly as a linear combination of s columns of D. [sent-145, score-0.247]
</p><p>47 An important result that underlies all SRC frameworks is the guarantee provided by the sparse recovery result that for a feature vector x with sparsity bounded from above by a constant depending on D [4, 6], x can be recovered by minimizing the ? [sent-146, score-0.388]
</p><p>48 We remark that the two programs, while related, are in fact different, with most sparse recovery results given by minimizing (P1). [sent-156, score-0.315]
</p><p>49 i gA typical SRC method will determine its classification based on its sparse coefficients obtained by minimizing the program (Pλ1). [sent-158, score-0.401]
</p><p>50 Compared to them, our proposed framework enlarges (thPe optimization domain by introducing the group coefficients a, and it is possible that with larger domain, spurious and incorrect solutions could arise. [sent-159, score-0.447]
</p><p>51 The following theorem rules out this possibility, at least when the sparse vector x can be exactly recovered by a typical SRC method and classified correctly:  (Pλ1)  Theorem 1. [sent-160, score-0.269]
</p><p>52 gF Purthermore, we assume that the global minimum of ECGSC, given a group of input adta ttha eX g, lios unique. [sent-163, score-0.266]
</p><p>53 The proofis straightforward and it consists ofchecking the sparse vector x also corresponds to the global  minimum of ECGSC (a, c). [sent-168, score-0.233]
</p><p>54 Since x is a sparse vector that can be recovered exactly by minimizing (Pλ1) in Eq. [sent-170, score-0.24]

</p><p>57 However, the behavior of GSC in this case is difficult to predict because other (noisy) input feature vectors will affect the sparse coding of the (noiseless) input vector, and the result of the subsequence pooling based on the matrix C can be uncertain. [sent-185, score-0.505]
</p><p>58 Second, if there is a sparse vector x lying inside the convex hull S spanned by x1, . [sent-186, score-0.586]
</p><p>59 In the standard ACGSC, the online reconstructed image X a is simply the convex combination of the input images as the columns of X. [sent-194, score-0.281]
</p><p>60 This model can be augmented using a known image domain partition and define the reconstructed image as a composite image that uses a different convex combination in each region of the partition. [sent-195, score-0.233]
</p><p>61 (a): ai are the group coefficients corresponding to the sample xi. [sent-207, score-0.359]
</p><p>62 The nonnegative affine constraint here is a1 + a2 = 1. [sent-208, score-0.225]
</p><p>63 The vector ap can then be optimized individually under the nonnegative affine constraints given in Eq. [sent-271, score-0.329]
</p><p>64 Sparse representations have been successfully applied to many vision  problems such as face recognition [12], [17], [22], image classification [23], [5], [7], denoising and inpainting [14], and other areas [25]. [sent-279, score-0.228]
</p><p>65 Interestingly, one of the original motivations for using sparse representations in solving vision problems is the realization that sparse representations of visual signals are produced in the first stage of visual processing by human brain [15]. [sent-280, score-0.46]
</p><p>66 In many cases, simply replacing the original features with their sparse representations leads to surprisingly better recognition/classification results [25]. [sent-281, score-0.261]
</p><p>67 Group sparse coding was first proposed in [1] and its extension to block-structured dictionaries has been studied in [2, 19]. [sent-282, score-0.422]
</p><p>68 In these methods, group sparsity was promoted using a matrix norm that encourages features in the same group to share the same atoms in the dictionary. [sent-283, score-0.559]
</p><p>69 From classification viewpoint, [1] has two undesirable features: First, the classification is based on matrices (multiple vectors) and this increase in dimension complicates the process. [sent-284, score-0.22]
</p><p>70 Second, while promoting group sparsity, [1] does not go beyond the test data xi themselves to search for potentially more useful features that are better-aligned with the dictionary. [sent-285, score-0.334]
</p><p>71 Our proposed framework addresses both shortcomings by introducing the group coefficients a in Eq. [sent-286, score-0.36]
</p><p>72 However, none of the  cited work has investigated face recognition under more realistic scenario when there are large differences between the illumination conditions of the training and test images. [sent-292, score-0.261]
</p><p>73 The training images were used to simulate the well-lit images such as passport photos, and the test images were used to simulate images (e. [sent-297, score-0.177]
</p><p>74 We used the training images directly as atoms of the dictionary D [5, 26]. [sent-305, score-0.273]
</p><p>75 We have also compared with two group-regularized sparse coding algorithms proposed by [1] [2]. [sent-329, score-0.392]
</p><p>76 Their algorithm promotes the data in a group (columns of X) to share same dictionary atoms. [sent-340, score-0.369]
</p><p>77 In [2], block structure was added to D together with the group structure on the data X. [sent-341, score-0.295]
</p><p>78 We applied these two methods to every test sample since they do not utilize group structure on data and the results are also shown in Fig. [sent-357, score-0.278]
</p><p>79 2, is that our method goes beyond the input test images and searches for a more “aligned” image on a larger domain (the convex hull spanned by X) while the group-regularized methods can only rely on the input images that are poorly poorly “aligned” with the dictionary. [sent-361, score-0.612]
</p><p>80 This is because, in their experiments, they randomly chose half of the dataset as atoms of D and the other half as test samples. [sent-374, score-0.213]
</p><p>81 Therefore their dictionaries are 50% larger than ours and the variability between training and test samples are much more limited due to the random selection of training images. [sent-375, score-0.192]

</p><p>92 Since there is no group structure defined in their framework, we computed the sparse coefficients for all the test images individually. [sent-534, score-0.569]
</p><p>93 We have also presented a form of sparse recovery result and based on this result, we have argued that, at least in theory, the classification performance using the proposed method should be as good as if not better than the one using existing SRC-based methods. [sent-561, score-0.381]

<p>Author: Zhaowen Wang, Jianchao Yang, Nasser Nasrabadi, Thomas Huang</p><p>Abstract: Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) is a powerful tool in distinguishing signal categories which lie on different subspaces. Despite its wide application to visual recognition tasks, current understanding of SRC is solely based on a reconstructive perspective, which neither offers any guarantee on its classification performance nor provides any insight on how to design a discriminative dictionary for SRC. In this paper, we present a novel perspective towards SRC and interpret it as a margin classifier. The decision boundary and margin of SRC are analyzed in local regions where the support of sparse code is stable. Based on the derived margin, we propose a hinge loss function as the gauge for the classification performance of SRC. A stochastic gradient descent algorithm is implemented to maximize the margin of SRC and obtain more discriminative dictionaries. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting classification performance and improving dictionary quality over reconstructive ones. Classification results competitive with other state-ofthe-art sparse coding methods are reported on several data sets.</p><p>3 0.23330744 <a title="45-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Group_Sparsity_and_Geometry_Constrained_Dictionary_Learning_for_Action_Recognition_from_Depth_Maps.html">188 iccv-2013-Group Sparsity and Geometry Constrained Dictionary Learning for Action Recognition from Depth Maps</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiajia Luo, Wei Wang, Hairong Qi</p><p>Abstract: Human action recognition based on the depth information provided by commodity depth sensors is an important yet challenging task. The noisy depth maps, different lengths of action sequences, and free styles in performing actions, may cause large intra-class variations. In this paper, a new framework based on sparse coding and temporal pyramid matching (TPM) is proposed for depthbased human action recognition. Especially, a discriminative class-specific dictionary learning algorithm isproposed for sparse coding. By adding the group sparsity and geometry constraints, features can be well reconstructed by the sub-dictionary belonging to the same class, and the geometry relationships among features are also kept in the calculated coefficients.

<p>Author: Yu-Tseh Chi, Mohsen Ali, Muhammad Rushdi, Jeffrey Ho</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for sparse coding that further improves upon the sparse representation-based classification (SRC) framework. The proposed framework, Affine-Constrained Group Sparse Coding (ACGSC), extends the current SRC framework to classification problems with multiple input samples. Geometrically, the affineconstrained group sparse coding essentially searches for the vector in the convex hull spanned by the input vectors that can best be sparse coded using the given dictionary. The resulting objectivefunction is still convex and can be efficiently optimized using iterative block-coordinate descent scheme that is guaranteed to converge. Furthermore, we provide a form of sparse recovery result that guarantees, at least theoretically, that the classification performance of the constrained group sparse coding should be at least as good as the group sparse coding. We have evaluated the proposed approach using three different recognition experiments that involve illumination variation of faces and textures, and face recognition under occlusions. Prelimi- nary experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and in particular, the results from the recognition/occlusion experiment are surprisingly accurate and robust.</p><p>2 0.91832274 <a title="45-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-A_Max-Margin_Perspective_on_Sparse_Representation-Based_Classification.html">20 iccv-2013-A Max-Margin Perspective on Sparse Representation-Based Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhaowen Wang, Jianchao Yang, Nasser Nasrabadi, Thomas Huang</p><p>Abstract: Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) is a powerful tool in distinguishing signal categories which lie on different subspaces. Despite its wide application to visual recognition tasks, current understanding of SRC is solely based on a reconstructive perspective, which neither offers any guarantee on its classification performance nor provides any insight on how to design a discriminative dictionary for SRC. In this paper, we present a novel perspective towards SRC and interpret it as a margin classifier. The decision boundary and margin of SRC are analyzed in local regions where the support of sparse code is stable. Based on the derived margin, we propose a hinge loss function as the gauge for the classification performance of SRC. A stochastic gradient descent algorithm is implemented to maximize the margin of SRC and obtain more discriminative dictionaries. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting classification performance and improving dictionary quality over reconstructive ones. Classification results competitive with other state-ofthe-art sparse coding methods are reported on several data sets.</p><p>3 0.84776795 <a title="45-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Dictionary_Learning_by_Error_Source_Decomposition.html">354 iccv-2013-Robust Dictionary Learning by Error Source Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhuoyuan Chen, Ying Wu</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity models have recently shown great promise in many vision tasks. Using a learned dictionary in sparsity models can in general outperform predefined bases in clean data. In practice, both training and testing data may be corrupted and contain noises and outliers. Although recent studies attempted to cope with corrupted data and achieved encouraging results in testing phase, how to handle corruption in training phase still remains a very difficult problem. In contrast to most existing methods that learn the dictionaryfrom clean data, this paper is targeted at handling corruptions and outliers in training data for dictionary learning. We propose a general method to decompose the reconstructive residual into two components: a non-sparse component for small universal noises and a sparse component for large outliers, respectively. In addition, , further analysis reveals the connection between our approach and the “partial” dictionary learning approach, updating only part of the prototypes (or informative codewords) with remaining (or noisy codewords) fixed. Experiments on synthetic data as well as real applications have shown satisfactory per- formance of this new robust dictionary learning approach.</p><p>4 0.83494353 <a title="45-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Semi-supervised_Robust_Dictionary_Learning_via_Efficient_l-Norms_Minimization.html">384 iccv-2013-Semi-supervised Robust Dictionary Learning via Efficient l-Norms Minimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Wangmeng Zuo, Deyu Meng, Lei Zhang, Xiangchu Feng, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In many sparse coding based image restoration and image classification problems, using non-convex ?p-norm minimization (0 ≤ p < 1) can often obtain better results than timhei convex 0?1 -norm m 1)ini camniza otfiteonn. Ab naiunm bbeetrt of algorithms, e.g., iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), iteratively thresholding method (ITM-?p), and look-up table (LUT), have been proposed for non-convex ?p-norm sparse coding, while some analytic solutions have been suggested for some specific values of p. In this paper, by extending the popular soft-thresholding operator, we propose a generalized iterated shrinkage algorithm (GISA) for ?p-norm non-convex sparse coding. Unlike the analytic solutions, the proposed GISA algorithm is easy to implement, and can be adopted for solving non-convex sparse coding problems with arbitrary p values. Compared with LUT, GISA is more general and does not need to compute and store the look-up tables. Compared with IRLS and ITM-?p, GISA is theoretically more solid and can achieve more accurate solutions. Experiments on image restoration and sparse coding based face recognition are conducted to validate the performance of GISA. ××</p><p>6 0.78945225 <a title="45-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Sparse_Variation_Dictionary_Learning_for_Face_Recognition_with_a_Single_Training_Sample_per_Person.html">398 iccv-2013-Sparse Variation Dictionary Learning for Face Recognition with a Single Training Sample per Person</a></p>

<p>Author: Xingyu Zeng, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Cascaded classifiers1 have been widely used in pedestrian detection and achieved great success. These classifiers are trained sequentially without joint optimization. In this paper, we propose a new deep model that can jointly train multi-stage classifiers through several stages of backpropagation. It keeps the score map output by a classifier within a local region and uses it as contextual information to support the decision at the next stage. Through a specific design of the training strategy, this deep architecture is able to simulate the cascaded classifiers by mining hard samples to train the network stage-by-stage. Each classifier handles samples at a different difficulty level. Unsupervised pre-training and specifically designed stage-wise supervised training are used to regularize the optimization problem. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the training strategy helps to avoid overfitting. Experimental results on three datasets (Caltech, ETH and TUD-Brussels) show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.</p><p>3 0.85920066 <a title="45-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Manifold_Based_Face_Synthesis_from_Sparse_Samples.html">259 iccv-2013-Manifold Based Face Synthesis from Sparse Samples</a></p>

Specifically, we propose methods based on generating auxiliary data in the form of synthetic samples using transformations of the original sparse samples. To incorporate the auxiliary data, we propose a weighted data synthesis method, which adaptively selects from the generated samples for inclusion during the manifold learning process via a weighted iterative algorithm. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we apply it to the problem of face image synthesis from sparse samples.

<p>Author: Vidit Jain, Sachin Sudhakar Farfade</p><p>Abstract: Classification cascades have been very effective for object detection. Such a cascade fails to perform well in data domains with variations in appearances that may not be captured in the training examples. This limited generalization severely restricts the domains for which they can be used effectively. A common approach to address this limitation is to train a new cascade of classifiers from scratch for each of the new domains. Building separate detectors for each of the different domains requires huge annotation and computational effort, making it not scalable to a large number of data domains. Here we present an algorithm for quickly adapting a pre-trained cascade of classifiers using a small number oflabeledpositive instancesfrom a different yet similar data domain. In our experiments with images of human babies and human-like characters from movies, we demonstrate that the adapted cascade significantly outperforms both of the original cascade and the one trained from scratch using the given training examples. –</p><p>6 0.84703124 <a title="45-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Transfer_Feature_Learning_with_Joint_Distribution_Adaptation.html">427 iccv-2013-Transfer Feature Learning with Joint Distribution Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhaowen Wang, Jianchao Yang, Nasser Nasrabadi, Thomas Huang</p><p>Abstract: Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) is a powerful tool in distinguishing signal categories which lie on different subspaces. Despite its wide application to visual recognition tasks, current understanding of SRC is solely based on a reconstructive perspective, which neither offers any guarantee on its classification performance nor provides any insight on how to design a discriminative dictionary for SRC. In this paper, we present a novel perspective towards SRC and interpret it as a margin classifier. The decision boundary and margin of SRC are analyzed in local regions where the support of sparse code is stable. Based on the derived margin, we propose a hinge loss function as the gauge for the classification performance of SRC. A stochastic gradient descent algorithm is implemented to maximize the margin of SRC and obtain more discriminative dictionaries. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting classification performance and improving dictionary quality over reconstructive ones. Classification results competitive with other state-ofthe-art sparse coding methods are reported on several data sets.</p><p>3 0.13136643 <a title="45-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Coupling_Alignments_with_Recognition_for_Still-to-Video_Face_Recognition.html">97 iccv-2013-Coupling Alignments with Recognition for Still-to-Video Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiwu Huang, Xiaowei Zhao, Shiguang Shan, Ruiping Wang, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: The Still-to-Video (S2V) face recognition systems typically need to match faces in low-quality videos captured under unconstrained conditions against high quality still face images, which is very challenging because of noise, image blur, lowface resolutions, varying headpose, complex lighting, and alignment difficulty. To address the problem, one solution is to select the frames of ‘best quality ’ from videos (hereinafter called quality alignment in this paper). Meanwhile, the faces in the selected frames should also be geometrically aligned to the still faces offline well-aligned in the gallery. In this paper, we discover that the interactions among the three tasks–quality alignment, geometric alignment and face recognition–can benefit from each other, thus should be performed jointly. With this in mind, we propose a Coupling Alignments with Recognition (CAR) method to tightly couple these tasks via low-rank regularized sparse representation in a unified framework. Our method makes the three tasks promote mutually by a joint optimization in an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier routine. Extensive , experiments on two challenging S2V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods impressively.</p><p>4 0.12984256 <a title="45-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Group_Sparsity_and_Geometry_Constrained_Dictionary_Learning_for_Action_Recognition_from_Depth_Maps.html">188 iccv-2013-Group Sparsity and Geometry Constrained Dictionary Learning for Action Recognition from Depth Maps</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiajia Luo, Wei Wang, Hairong Qi</p><p>Abstract: Human action recognition based on the depth information provided by commodity depth sensors is an important yet challenging task. The noisy depth maps, different lengths of action sequences, and free styles in performing actions, may cause large intra-class variations. In this paper, a new framework based on sparse coding and temporal pyramid matching (TPM) is proposed for depthbased human action recognition. Especially, a discriminative class-specific dictionary learning algorithm isproposed for sparse coding. By adding the group sparsity and geometry constraints, features can be well reconstructed by the sub-dictionary belonging to the same class, and the geometry relationships among features are also kept in the calculated coefficients. The proposed approach is evaluated on two benchmark datasets captured by depth cameras.

<p>Author: Ehsan Elhamifar, Guillermo Sapiro, Allen Yang, S. Shankar Sasrty</p><p>Abstract: In many image/video/web classification problems, we have access to a large number of unlabeled samples. However, it is typically expensive and time consuming to obtain labels for the samples. Active learning is the problem of progressively selecting and annotating the most informative unlabeled samples, in order to obtain a high classification performance. Most existing active learning algorithms select only one sample at a time prior to retraining the classifier. Hence, they are computationally expensive and cannot take advantage of parallel labeling systems such as Mechanical Turk. On the other hand, algorithms that allow the selection of multiple samples prior to retraining the classifier, may select samples that have significant information overlap or they involve solving a non-convex optimization. More importantly, the majority of active learning algorithms are developed for a certain classifier type such as SVM. In this paper, we develop an efficient active learning framework based on convex programming, which can select multiple samples at a time for annotation. Unlike the state of the art, our algorithm can be used in conjunction with any type of classifiers, including those of the fam- ily of the recently proposed Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC). We use the two principles of classifier uncertainty and sample diversity in order to guide the optimization program towards selecting the most informative unlabeled samples, which have the least information overlap. Our method can incorporate the data distribution in the selection process by using the appropriate dissimilarity between pairs of samples. We show the effectiveness of our framework in person detection, scene categorization and face recognition on real-world datasets.</p><p>6 0.11420862 <a title="45-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_Generalized_Iterated_Shrinkage_Algorithm_for_Non-convex_Sparse_Coding.html">14 iccv-2013-A Generalized Iterated Shrinkage Algorithm for Non-convex Sparse Coding</a></p>

<p>Author: Wangmeng Zuo, Deyu Meng, Lei Zhang, Xiangchu Feng, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In many sparse coding based image restoration and image classification problems, using non-convex ?p-norm minimization (0 ≤ p < 1) can often obtain better results than timhei convex 0?1 -norm m 1)ini camniza otfiteonn. Ab naiunm bbeetrt of algorithms, e.g., iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), iteratively thresholding method (ITM-?p), and look-up table (LUT), have been proposed for non-convex ?p-norm sparse coding, while some analytic solutions have been suggested for some specific values of p. In this paper, by extending the popular soft-thresholding operator, we propose a generalized iterated shrinkage algorithm (GISA) for ?p-norm non-convex sparse coding. Unlike the analytic solutions, the proposed GISA algorithm is easy to implement, and can be adopted for solving non-convex sparse coding problems with arbitrary p values. Compared with LUT, GISA is more general and does not need to compute and store the look-up tables. Compared with IRLS and ITM-?p, GISA is theoretically more solid and can achieve more accurate solutions. Experiments on image restoration and sparse coding based face recognition are conducted to validate the performance of GISA. ××</p><p>4 0.73129851 <a title="45-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Sparse_Variation_Dictionary_Learning_for_Face_Recognition_with_a_Single_Training_Sample_per_Person.html">398 iccv-2013-Sparse Variation Dictionary Learning for Face Recognition with a Single Training Sample per Person</a></p>
<p>Author: Meng Yang, Luc Van_Gool, Lei Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Face recognition (FR) with a single training sample per person (STSPP) is a very challenging problem due to the lack of information to predict the variations in the query sample. Sparse representation based classification has shown interesting results in robust FR; however, its performance will deteriorate much for FR with STSPP. To address this issue, in this paper we learn a sparse variation dictionary from a generic training set to improve the query sample representation by STSPP. Instead of learning from the generic training set independently w.r.t. the gallery set, the proposed sparse variation dictionary learning (SVDL) method is adaptive to the gallery set by jointly learning a projection to connect the generic training set with the gallery set. The learnt sparse variation dictionary can be easily integrated into the framework of sparse representation based classification so that various variations in face images, including illumination, expression, occlusion, pose, etc., can be better handled. Experiments on the large-scale CMU Multi-PIE, FRGC and LFW databases demonstrate the promising performance of SVDL on FR with STSPP.</p><p>5 0.62413114 <a title="45-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Semi-supervised_Robust_Dictionary_Learning_via_Efficient_l-Norms_Minimization.html">384 iccv-2013-Semi-supervised Robust Dictionary Learning via Efficient l-Norms Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Weidong Cai, Heng Huang</p><p>Abstract: Representing the raw input of a data set by a set of relevant codes is crucial to many computer vision applications. Due to the intrinsic sparse property of real-world data, dictionary learning, in which the linear decomposition of a data point uses a set of learned dictionary bases, i.e., codes, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, traditional dictionary learning methods suffer from three weaknesses: sensitivity to noisy and outlier samples, difficulty to determine the optimal dictionary size, and incapability to incorporate supervision information. In this paper, we address these weaknesses by learning a Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSR-D). Specifically, we use the ℓ2,0+ norm as the loss function to improve the robustness against outliers, and develop a new structured sparse regularization com, , tom. . cai@sydney . edu . au , heng@uta .edu make the learning tasks easier to deal with and reduce the computational cost. For example, in image tagging, instead of using the raw pixel-wise features, semi-local or patch- based features, such as SIFT and geometric blur, are usually more desirable to achieve better performance. In practice, finding a set of compact features bases, also referred to as dictionary, with enhanced representative and discriminative power, plays a significant role in building a successful computer vision system. In this paper, we explore this important problem by proposing a novel formulation and its solution for learning Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSRD), where we examine the challenges in dictionary learning, and seek opportunities to overcome them and improve the dictionary qualities. 1.1. Challenges in Dictionary Learning to incorporate the supervision information in dictionary learning, without incurring additional parameters. Moreover, the optimal dictionary size is automatically learned from the input data. Minimizing the derived objective function is challenging because it involves many non-smooth ℓ2,0+ -norm terms. We present an efficient algorithm to solve the problem with a rigorous proof of the convergence of the algorithm. Extensive experiments are presented to show the superior performance of the proposed method.</p><p>6 0.61498928 <a title="45-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Correntropy_Induced_L2_Graph_for_Robust_Subspace_Clustering.html">94 iccv-2013-Correntropy Induced L2 Graph for Robust Subspace Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Piotr Dollár, C. Lawrence Zitnick</p><p>Abstract: Edge detection is a critical component of many vision systems, including object detectors and image segmentation algorithms. Patches of edges exhibit well-known forms of local structure, such as straight lines or T-junctions. In this paper we take advantage of the structure present in local image patches to learn both an accurate and computationally efficient edge detector. We formulate the problem of predicting local edge masks in a structured learning framework applied to random decision forests. Our novel approach to learning decision trees robustly maps the structured labels to a discrete space on which standard information gain measures may be evaluated. The result is an approach that obtains realtime performance that is orders of magnitude faster than many competing state-of-the-art approaches, while also achieving state-of-the-art edge detection results on the BSDS500 Segmentation dataset and NYU Depth dataset. Finally, we show the potential of our approach as a general purpose edge detector by showing our learned edge models generalize well across datasets.</p><p>2 0.79980522 <a title="45-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Distributed_Low-Rank_Subspace_Segmentation.html">122 iccv-2013-Distributed Low-Rank Subspace Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ameet Talwalkar, Lester Mackey, Yadong Mu, Shih-Fu Chang, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Vision problems ranging from image clustering to motion segmentation to semi-supervised learning can naturally be framed as subspace segmentation problems, in which one aims to recover multiple low-dimensional subspaces from noisy and corrupted input data. Low-Rank Representation (LRR), a convex formulation of the subspace segmentation problem, is provably and empirically accurate on small problems but does not scale to the massive sizes of modern vision datasets. Moreover, past work aimed at scaling up low-rank matrix factorization is not applicable to LRR given its non-decomposable constraints. In this work, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for large-scale subspace segmentation that can cope with LRR ’s non-decomposable constraints and maintains LRR ’s strong recovery guarantees. This has immediate implications for the scalability of subspace segmentation, which we demonstrate on a benchmark face recognition dataset and in simulations. We then introduce novel applications of LRR-based subspace segmentation to large-scale semisupervised learning for multimedia event detection, concept detection, and image tagging. In each case, we obtain stateof-the-art results and order-of-magnitude speed ups.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.77837938 <a title="45-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Affine-Constrained_Group_Sparse_Coding_and_Its_Application_to_Image-Based_Classifications.html">45 iccv-2013-Affine-Constrained Group Sparse Coding and Its Application to Image-Based Classifications</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu-Tseh Chi, Mohsen Ali, Muhammad Rushdi, Jeffrey Ho</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for sparse coding that further improves upon the sparse representation-based classification (SRC) framework. The proposed framework, Affine-Constrained Group Sparse Coding (ACGSC), extends the current SRC framework to classification problems with multiple input samples. Geometrically, the affineconstrained group sparse coding essentially searches for the vector in the convex hull spanned by the input vectors that can best be sparse coded using the given dictionary. The resulting objectivefunction is still convex and can be efficiently optimized using iterative block-coordinate descent scheme that is guaranteed to converge. Furthermore, we provide a form of sparse recovery result that guarantees, at least theoretically, that the classification performance of the constrained group sparse coding should be at least as good as the group sparse coding. We have evaluated the proposed approach using three different recognition experiments that involve illumination variation of faces and textures, and face recognition under occlusions. Prelimi- nary experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and in particular, the results from the recognition/occlusion experiment are surprisingly accurate and robust.</p><p>4 0.75753516 <a title="45-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-GOSUS%3A_Grassmannian_Online_Subspace_Updates_with_Structured-Sparsity.html">182 iccv-2013-GOSUS: Grassmannian Online Subspace Updates with Structured-Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jia Xu, Vamsi K. Ithapu, Lopamudra Mukherjee, James M. Rehg, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online subspace learning in the context of sequential observations involving structured perturbations. In online subspace learning, the observations are an unknown mixture of two components presented to the model sequentially the main effect which pertains to the subspace and a residual/error term. If no additional requirement is imposed on the residual, it often corresponds to noise terms in the signal which were unaccounted for by the main effect. To remedy this, one may impose ‘structural’ contiguity, which has the intended effect of leveraging the secondary terms as a covariate that helps the estimation of the subspace itself, instead of merely serving as a noise residual. We show that the corresponding online estimation procedure can be written as an approximate optimization process on a Grassmannian. We propose an efficient numerical solution, GOSUS, Grassmannian Online Subspace Updates with Structured-sparsity, for this problem. GOSUS is expressive enough in modeling both homogeneous perturbations of the subspace and structural contiguities of outliers, and after certain manipulations, solvable — via an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We evaluate the empirical performance of this algorithm on two problems of interest: online background subtraction and online multiple face tracking, and demonstrate that it achieves competitive performance with the state-of-the-art in near real time.</p><p>5 0.75566924 <a title="45-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Pictorial_Human_Spaces%3A_How_Well_Do_Humans_Perceive_a_3D_Articulated_Pose%3F.html">316 iccv-2013-Pictorial Human Spaces: How Well Do Humans Perceive a 3D Articulated Pose?</a></p>
<p>Author: Elisabeta Marinoiu, Dragos Papava, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Human motion analysis in images and video is a central computer vision problem. Yet, there are no studies that reveal how humans perceive other people in images and how accurate they are. In this paper we aim to unveil some of the processing–as well as the levels of accuracy–involved in the 3D perception of people from images by assessing the human performance. Our contributions are: (1) the construction of an experimental apparatus that relates perception and measurement, in particular the visual and kinematic performance with respect to 3D ground truth when the human subject is presented an image of a person in a given pose; (2) the creation of a dataset containing images, articulated 2D and 3D pose ground truth, as well as synchronized eye movement recordings of human subjects, shown a variety of human body configurations, both easy and difficult, as well as their ‘re-enacted’ 3D poses; (3) quantitative analysis revealing the human performance in 3D pose reenactment tasks, the degree of stability in the visual fixation patterns of human subjects, and the way it correlates with different poses. We also discuss the implications of our find- ings for the construction of visual human sensing systems.</p><p>6 0.75335503 <a title="45-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Subspace_Stabilization_for_Stereoscopic_Video.html">226 iccv-2013-Joint Subspace Stabilization for Stereoscopic Video</a></p>

<p>Author: Baoyuan Wu, Siwei Lyu, Bao-Gang Hu, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel method that simultaneously clusters and associates short sequences of detected faces (termed as face tracklets) in videos. The rationale of our method is that face tracklet clustering and linking are related problems that can benefit from the solutions of each other. Our method is based on a hidden Markov random field model that represents the joint dependencies of cluster labels and tracklet linking associations . We provide an efficient algorithm based on constrained clustering and optimal matching for the simultaneous inference of cluster labels and tracklet associations. We demonstrate significant improvements on the state-of-the-art results in face tracking and clustering performances on several video datasets.</p><p>4 0.21067019 <a title="120-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Bayesian_3D_Tracking_from_Monocular_Video.html">58 iccv-2013-Bayesian 3D Tracking from Monocular Video</a></p>

We develop a Bayesian modeling approach for tracking people in 3D from monocular video with unknown cameras. Modeling in 3D provides natural explanations for occlusions and smoothness discontinuities that result from projection, and allows priors on velocity and smoothness to be grounded in physical quantities: meters and seconds vs. pixels and frames. We pose the problem in the context of data association, in which observations are assigned to tracks. A correct application of Bayesian inference to multitarget tracking must address the fact that the model’s dimension changes as tracks are added or removed, and thus, posterior densities of different hypotheses are not comparable. We address this by marginalizing out the trajectory parameters so the resulting posterior over data associations has constant dimension. This is made tractable by using (a) Gaussian process priors for smooth trajectories and (b) approximately Gaussian likelihood functions. Our approach provides a principled method for incorporating multiple sources of evidence; we present results using both optical flow and object detector outputs. Results are comparable to recent work on 3D tracking and, unlike others, our method requires no pre-calibrated cameras.</p><p>5 0.20122412 <a title="120-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Improving_Graph_Matching_via_Density_Maximization.html">214 iccv-2013-Improving Graph Matching via Density Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Chao Wang, Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching has been widely used in various applications in computer vision due to its powerful performance. However, it poses three challenges to image sparse feature matching: (1) The combinatorial nature limits the size of the possible matches; (2) It is sensitive to outliers because the objective function prefers more matches; (3) It works poorly when handling many-to-many object correspondences, due to its assumption of one single cluster for each graph. In this paper, we address these problems with a unified framework—Density Maximization. We propose a graph density local estimator (퐷퐿퐸) to measure the quality of matches. Density Maximization aims to maximize the 퐷퐿퐸 values both locally and globally. The local maximization of 퐷퐿퐸 finds the clusters of nodes as well as eliminates the outliers. The global maximization of 퐷퐿퐸 efficiently refines the matches by exploring a much larger matching space. Our Density Maximization is orthogonal to specific graph matching algorithms. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that it significantly boosts the true matches and enables graph matching to handle both outliers and many-to-many object correspondences.</p><p>6 0.19336942 <a title="120-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-The_Way_They_Move%3A_Tracking_Multiple_Targets_with_Similar_Appearance.html">418 iccv-2013-The Way They Move: Tracking Multiple Targets with Similar Appearance</a></p>

<p>Author: Caglayan Dicle, Octavia I. Camps, Mario Sznaier</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient algorithm for multi-object tracking by detection that addresses four main challenges: appearance similarity among targets, missing data due to targets being out of the field of view or occluded behind other objects, crossing trajectories, and camera motion. The proposed method uses motion dynamics as a cue to distinguish targets with similar appearance, minimize target mis-identification and recover missing data. Computational efficiency is achieved by using a Generalized Linear Assignment (GLA) coupled with efficient procedures to recover missing data and estimate the complexity of the underlying dynamics. The proposed approach works with tracklets of arbitrary length and does not assume a dynamical model a priori, yet it captures the overall motion dynamics of the targets. Experiments using challenging videos show that this framework can handle complex target motions, non-stationary cameras and long occlusions, on scenarios where appearance cues are not available or poor.</p><p>3 0.71487993 <a title="120-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Data_Association%3A_Bayesian_Model_Selection_for_Multi-target_Tracking.html">230 iccv-2013-Latent Data Association: Bayesian Model Selection for Multi-target Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Christoph Straehle, Ullrich Koethe, Fred A. Hamprecht</p><p>Abstract: We propose a scheme that allows to partition an image into a previously unknown number of segments, using only minimal supervision in terms of a few must-link and cannotlink annotations. We make no use of regional data terms, learning instead what constitutes a likely boundary between segments. Since boundaries are only implicitly specified through cannot-link constraints, this is a hard and nonconvex latent variable problem. We address this problem in a greedy fashion using a randomized decision tree on features associated with interpixel edges. We use a structured purity criterion during tree construction and also show how a backtracking strategy can be used to prevent the greedy search from ending up in poor local optima. The proposed strategy is compared with prior art on natural images.</p><p>5 0.64403081 <a title="120-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Network_Principles_for_SfM%3A_Disambiguating_Repeated_Structures_with_Local_Context.html">289 iccv-2013-Network Principles for SfM: Disambiguating Repeated Structures with Local Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Kyle Wilson, Noah Snavely</p><p>Abstract: Repeated features are common in urban scenes. Many objects, such as clock towers with nearly identical sides, or domes with strong radial symmetries, pose challenges for structure from motion. When similar but distinct features are mistakenly equated, the resulting 3D reconstructions can have errors ranging from phantom walls and superimposed structures to a complete failure to reconstruct. We present a new approach to solving such problems by considering the local visibility structure of such repeated features. Drawing upon network theory, we present a new way of scoring features using a measure of local clustering. Our model leads to a simple, fast, and highly scalable technique for disambiguating repeated features based on an analysis of an underlying visibility graph, without relying on explicit geometric reasoning. We demonstrate our method on several very large datasets drawn from Internet photo collections, and compare it to a more traditional geometry-based disambiguation technique.</p><p>6 0.64211094 <a title="120-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Conservation_Tracking.html">87 iccv-2013-Conservation Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Yinqiang Zheng, Yubin Kuang, Shigeki Sugimoto, Kalle Åström, Masatoshi Okutomi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the classical perspective-n-point (PnP) problem, and propose the first non-iterative O(n) solution that is fast, generally applicable and globally optimal. Our basic idea is to formulate the PnP problem into a functional minimization problem and retrieve all its stationary points by using the Gr¨ obner basis technique. The novelty lies in a non-unit quaternion representation to parameterize the rotation and a simple but elegant formulation of the PnP problem into an unconstrained optimization problem. Interestingly, the polynomial system arising from its first-order optimality condition assumes two-fold symmetry, a nice property that can be utilized to improve speed and numerical stability of a Gr¨ obner basis solver. Experiment results have demonstrated that, in terms of accuracy, our proposed solution is definitely better than the state-ofthe-art O(n) methods, and even comparable with the reprojection error minimization method.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.726107 <a title="120-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminative_Label_Propagation_for_Multi-object_Tracking_with_Sporadic_Appearance_Features.html">120 iccv-2013-Discriminative Label Propagation for Multi-object Tracking with Sporadic Appearance Features</a></p>
<p>Author: K.C. Amit Kumar, Christophe De_Vleeschouwer</p><p>Abstract: Given a set of plausible detections, detected at each time instant independently, we investigate how to associate them across time. This is done by propagating labels on a set of graphs that capture how the spatio-temporal and the appearance cues promote the assignment of identical or distinct labels to a pair of nodes. The graph construction is driven by the locally linear embedding (LLE) of either the spatio-temporal or the appearance features associated to the detections. Interestingly, the neighborhood of a node in each appearance graph is defined to include all nodes for which the appearance feature is available (except the ones that coexist at the same time). This allows to connect the nodes that share the same appearance even if they are temporally distant, which gives our framework the uncommon ability to exploit the appearance features that are available only sporadically along the sequence of detections. Once the graphs have been defined, the multi-object tracking is formulated as the problem of finding a label assignment that is consistent with the constraints captured by each of the graphs. This results into a difference of convex program that can be efficiently solved. Experiments are performed on a basketball and several well-known pedestrian datasets in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</p><p>3 0.6838181 <a title="120-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Data_Association%3A_Bayesian_Model_Selection_for_Multi-target_Tracking.html">230 iccv-2013-Latent Data Association: Bayesian Model Selection for Multi-target Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Aleksandr V. Segal, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel parametrization of the data association problem for multi-target tracking. In our formulation, the number of targets is implicitly inferred together with the data association, effectively solving data association and model selection as a single inference problem. The novel formulation allows us to interpret data association and tracking as a single Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS). We compute an approximate posterior solution to this problem using a dynamic programming/message passing technique. This inference-based approach allows us to incorporate richer probabilistic models into the tracking system. In particular, we incorporate inference over inliers/outliers and track termination times into the system. We evaluate our approach on publicly available datasets and demonstrate results competitive with, and in some cases exceeding the state of the art.</p><p>4 0.68092179 <a title="120-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven_Efficiently-Sampled_Sparse_Graphical_Models_for_Concurrent_Tumor_Segmentation_and_Atlas_Registration.html">432 iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven Efficiently-Sampled Sparse Graphical Models for Concurrent Tumor Segmentation and Atlas Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Sarah Parisot, William Wells_III, Stéphane Chemouny, Hugues Duffau, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based methods have become popular in recent years and have successfully addressed tasks like segmentation and deformable registration. Their main strength is optimality of the obtained solution while their main limitation is the lack of precision due to the grid-like representations and the discrete nature of the quantized search space. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for combined segmentation/registration of brain tumors that adapts graph and sampling resolution according to the image content. To this end we estimate the segmentation and registration marginals towards adaptive graph resolution and intelligent definition of the search space. This information is considered in a hierarchical framework where uncertainties are propagated in a natural manner. State of the art results in the joint segmentation/registration of brain images with low-grade gliomas demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>5 0.67862326 <a title="120-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Motion_for_Every_Visible_Point.html">441 iccv-2013-Video Motion for Every Visible Point</a></p>
<p>Author: Susanna Ricco, Carlo Tomasi</p><p>Abstract: Dense motion of image points over many video frames can provide important information about the world. However, occlusions and drift make it impossible to compute long motionpaths by merely concatenating opticalflow vectors between consecutive frames. Instead, we solve for entire paths directly, and flag the frames in which each is visible. As in previous work, we anchor each path to a unique pixel which guarantees an even spatial distribution of paths. Unlike earlier methods, we allow paths to be anchored in any frame. By explicitly requiring that at least one visible path passes within a small neighborhood of every pixel, we guarantee complete coverage of all visible points in all frames. We achieve state-of-the-art results on real sequences including both rigid and non-rigid motions with significant occlusions.</p><p>6 0.67810643 <a title="120-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Parsing_IKEA_Objects%3A_Fine_Pose_Estimation.html">308 iccv-2013-Parsing IKEA Objects: Fine Pose Estimation</a></p>

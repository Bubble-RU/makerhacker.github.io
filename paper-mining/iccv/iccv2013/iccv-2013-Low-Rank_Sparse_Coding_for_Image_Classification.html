<p>Author: Yannis Avrithis</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by the close relation between nearest neighbor search and clustering in high-dimensional spaces as well as the success of one helping to solve the other, we introduce a new paradigm where both problems are solved simultaneously. Our solution is recursive, not in the size of input data but in the number of dimensions. One result is a clustering algorithm that is tuned to small codebooks but does not need all data in memory at the same time and is practically constant in the data size. As a by-product, a tree structure performs either exact or approximate quantization on trained centroids, the latter being not very precise but extremely fast. A lesser contribution is a new indexing scheme for image retrieval that exploits multiple small codebooks to provide an arbitrarily fine partition of the descriptor space. Large scale experiments on public datasets exhibit state of the art performance and remarkable generalization.</p><p>3 0.095761076 <a title="258-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Hierarchical_Joint_Max-Margin_Learning_of_Mid_and_Top_Level_Representations_for_Visual_Recognition.html">197 iccv-2013-Hierarchical Joint Max-Margin Learning of Mid and Top Level Representations for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Hans Lobel, Ren√© Vidal, Alvaro Soto</p><p>Abstract: Currently, Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) and part-based methods are the most popular approaches for visual recognition. In both cases, a mid-level representation is built on top of low-level image descriptors and top-level classifiers use this mid-level representation to achieve visual recognition. While in current part-based approaches, mid- and top-level representations are usually jointly trained, this is not the usual case for BoVW schemes. A main reason for this is the complex data association problem related to the usual large dictionary size needed by BoVW approaches. As a further observation, typical solutions based on BoVW and part-based representations are usually limited to extensions of binary classification schemes, a strategy that ignores relevant correlations among classes. In this work we propose a novel hierarchical approach to visual recognition based on a BoVW scheme that jointly learns suitable midand top-level representations. Furthermore, using a maxmargin learning framework, the proposed approach directly handles the multiclass case at both levels of abstraction. We test our proposed method using several popular bench- mark datasets. As our main result, we demonstrate that, by coupling learning of mid- and top-level representations, the proposed approach fosters sharing of discriminative visual words among target classes, being able to achieve state-ofthe-art recognition performance using far less visual words than previous approaches.</p><p>4 0.084627032 <a title="258-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_to_Share_Latent_Tasks_for_Action_Recognition.html">249 iccv-2013-Learning to Share Latent Tasks for Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiang Zhou, Gang Wang, Kui Jia, Qi Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Sharing knowledge for multiple related machine learning tasks is an effective strategy to improve the generalization performance. In this paper, we investigate knowledge sharing across categories for action recognition in videos. The motivation is that many action categories are related, where common motion pattern are shared among them (e.g. diving and high jump share the jump motion). We propose a new multi-task learning method to learn latent tasks shared across categories, and reconstruct a classifier for each category from these latent tasks. Compared to previous methods, our approach has two advantages: (1) The learned latent tasks correspond to basic motionpatterns instead offull actions, thus enhancing discrimination power of the classifiers. (2) Categories are selected to share information with a sparsity regularizer, avoidingfalselyforcing all categories to share knowledge. Experimental results on multiplepublic data sets show that the proposed approach can effectively transfer knowledge between different action categories to improve the performance of conventional single task learning methods.</p><p>5 0.081379659 <a title="258-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Characterizing_Layouts_of_Outdoor_Scenes_Using_Spatial_Topic_Processes.html">72 iccv-2013-Characterizing Layouts of Outdoor Scenes Using Spatial Topic Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Dahua Lin, Jianxiong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generative model to describe the layouts of outdoor scenes the spatial configuration of regions. Specifically, the layout of an image is represented as a composite of regions, each associated with a semantic topic. At the heart of this model is a novel stochastic process called Spatial Topic Process, which generates a spatial map of topics from a set of coupled Gaussian processes, thus allowing the distributions of topics to vary continuously across the image plane. A key aspect that distinguishes this model from previous ones consists in its capability of capturing dependencies across both locations and topics while allowing substantial variations in the layouts. We demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed model by testing it on scene classification, semantic segmentation, and layout hallucination. ‚Äì</p><p>6 0.079690836 <a title="258-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Space_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering.html">232 iccv-2013-Latent Space Sparse Subspace Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Nakamasa Inoue, Koichi Shinoda</p><p>Abstract: Assigning a visual code to a low-level image descriptor, which we call code assignment, is the most computationally expensive part of image classification algorithms based on the bag of visual word (BoW) framework. This paper proposes a fast computation method, Neighbor-toNeighbor (NTN) search, for this code assignment. Based on the fact that image features from an adjacent region are usually similar to each other, this algorithm effectively reduces the cost of calculating the distance between a codeword and a feature vector. This method can be applied not only to a hard codebook constructed by vector quantization (NTN-VQ), but also to a soft codebook, a Gaussian mixture model (NTN-GMM). We evaluated this method on the PASCAL VOC 2007 classification challenge task. NTN-VQ reduced the assignment cost by 77.4% in super-vector coding, and NTN-GMM reduced it by 89.3% in Fisher-vector coding, without any significant degradation in classification performance.</p><p>3 0.61310279 <a title="258-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Hierarchical_Joint_Max-Margin_Learning_of_Mid_and_Top_Level_Representations_for_Visual_Recognition.html">197 iccv-2013-Hierarchical Joint Max-Margin Learning of Mid and Top Level Representations for Visual Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Ankit Gandhi, Karteek Alahari, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: We aim to decompose a global histogram representation of an image into histograms of its associated objects and regions. This task is formulated as an optimization problem, given a set of linear classifiers, which can effectively discriminate the object categories present in the image. Our decomposition bypasses harder problems associated with accurately localizing and segmenting objects. We evaluate our method on a wide variety of composite histograms, and also compare it with MRF-based solutions. In addition to merely measuring the accuracy of decomposition, we also show the utility of the estimated object and background histograms for the task of image classification on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.</p><p>5 0.60384703 <a title="258-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-SIFTpack%3A_A_Compact_Representation_for_Efficient_SIFT_Matching.html">365 iccv-2013-SIFTpack: A Compact Representation for Efficient SIFT Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandra Gilinsky, Lihi Zelnik Manor</p><p>Abstract: Computing distances between large sets of SIFT descriptors is a basic step in numerous algorithms in computer vision. When the number of descriptors is large, as is often the case, computing these distances can be extremely time consuming. In this paper we propose the SIFTpack: a compact way of storing SIFT descriptors, which enables significantly faster calculations between sets of SIFTs than the current solutions. SIFTpack can be used to represent SIFTs densely extracted from a single image or sparsely from multiple different images. We show that the SIFTpack representation saves both storage space and run time, for both finding nearest neighbors and for computing all distances between all descriptors. The usefulness of SIFTpack is also demonstrated as an alternative implementation for K-means dictionaries of visual words.</p><p>6 0.60331988 <a title="258-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Characterizing_Layouts_of_Outdoor_Scenes_Using_Spatial_Topic_Processes.html">72 iccv-2013-Characterizing Layouts of Outdoor Scenes Using Spatial Topic Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Xinxiao Wu, Han Wang, Cuiwei Liu, Yunde Jia</p><p>Abstract: In cross-view action recognition, ‚Äúwhat you saw‚Äù in one view is different from ‚Äúwhat you recognize ‚Äù in another view. The data distribution even the feature space can change from one view to another due to the appearance and motion of actions drastically vary across different views. In this paper, we address the problem of transferring action models learned in one view (source view) to another different view (target view), where action instances from these two views are represented by heterogeneous features. A novel learning method, called Heterogeneous Transfer Discriminantanalysis of Canonical Correlations (HTDCC), is proposed to learn a discriminative common feature space for linking source and target views to transfer knowledge between them. Two projection matrices that respectively map data from source and target views into the common space are optimized via simultaneously minimizing the canonical correlations of inter-class samples and maximizing the intraclass canonical correlations. Our model is neither restricted to corresponding action instances in the two views nor restricted to the same type of feature, and can handle only a few or even no labeled samples available in the target view. To reduce the data distribution mismatch between the source and target views in the commonfeature space, a nonparametric criterion is included in the objective function. We additionally propose a joint weight learning method to fuse multiple source-view action classifiers for recognition in the target view. Different combination weights are assigned to different source views, with each weight presenting how contributive the corresponding source view is to the target view. The proposed method is evaluated on the IXMAS multi-view dataset and achieves promising results.</p><p>2 0.99841273 <a title="258-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-3DNN%3A_Viewpoint_Invariant_3D_Geometry_Matching_for_Scene_Understanding.html">1 iccv-2013-3DNN: Viewpoint Invariant 3D Geometry Matching for Scene Understanding</a></p>
<p>Author: Scott Satkin, Martial Hebert</p><p>Abstract: We present a new algorithm 3DNN (3D NearestNeighbor), which is capable of matching an image with 3D data, independently of the viewpoint from which the image was captured. By leveraging rich annotations associated with each image, our algorithm can automatically produce precise and detailed 3D models of a scene from a single image. Moreover, we can transfer information across images to accurately label and segment objects in a scene. The true benefit of 3DNN compared to a traditional 2D nearest-neighbor approach is that by generalizing across viewpoints, we free ourselves from the need to have training examples captured from all possible viewpoints. Thus, we are able to achieve comparable results using orders of magnitude less data, and recognize objects from never-beforeseen viewpoints. In this work, we describe the 3DNN algorithm and rigorously evaluate its performance for the tasks of geometry estimation and object detection/segmentation. By decoupling the viewpoint and the geometry of an image, we develop a scene matching approach which is truly 100% viewpoint invariant, yielding state-of-the-art performance on challenging data.</p><p>3 0.99790782 <a title="258-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Person_Re-identification_by_Salience_Matching.html">313 iccv-2013-Person Re-identification by Salience Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Zhao, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Human salience is distinctive and reliable information in matching pedestrians across disjoint camera views. In this paper, we exploit the pairwise salience distribution relationship between pedestrian images, and solve the person re-identification problem by proposing a salience matching strategy. To handle the misalignment problem in pedestrian images, patch matching is adopted and patch salience is estimated. Matching patches with inconsistent salience brings penalty. Images of the same person are recognized by minimizing the salience matching cost. Furthermore, our salience matching is tightly integrated with patch matching in a unified structural RankSVM learning framework. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on the VIPeR dataset and the CUHK Campus dataset. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both datasets.</p><p>4 0.99757081 <a title="258-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Separating_Reflective_and_Fluorescent_Components_Using_High_Frequency_Illumination_in_the_Spectral_Domain.html">385 iccv-2013-Separating Reflective and Fluorescent Components Using High Frequency Illumination in the Spectral Domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Ying Fu, Antony Lam, Imari Sato, Takahiro Okabe, Yoichi Sato</p><p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging is beneficial to many applications but current methods do not consider fluorescent effects which are present in everyday items ranging from paper, to clothing, to even our food. Furthermore, everyday fluorescent items exhibit a mix of reflectance and fluorescence. So proper separation of these components is necessary for analyzing them. In this paper, we demonstrate efficient separation and recovery of reflective and fluorescent emission spectra through the use of high frequency illumination in the spectral domain. With the obtained fluorescent emission spectra from our high frequency illuminants, we then present to our knowledge, the first method for estimating the fluorescent absorption spectrum of a material given its emission spectrum. Conventional bispectral measurement of absorption and emission spectra needs to examine all combinations of incident and observed light wavelengths. In contrast, our method requires only two hyperspectral images. The effectiveness of our proposed methods are then evaluated through a combination of simulation and real experiments. We also demonstrate an application of our method to synthetic relighting of real scenes.</p><p>5 0.99713147 <a title="258-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Discriminative_Part_Detectors_for_Image_Classification_and_Cosegmentation.html">236 iccv-2013-Learning Discriminative Part Detectors for Image Classification and Cosegmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jian Sun, Jean Ponce</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of learning discriminative part detectors from image sets with category labels. We propose a novel latent SVM model regularized by group sparsity to learn these part detectors. Starting from a large set of initial parts, the group sparsity regularizer forces the model to jointly select and optimize a set of discriminative part detectors in a max-margin framework. We propose a stochastic version of a proximal algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization problem. We apply the proposed method to image classification and cosegmentation, and quantitative experiments with standard benchmarks show that it matches or improves upon the state of the art.</p><p>6 0.99591333 <a title="258-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_New_Image_Quality_Metric_for_Image_Auto-denoising.html">23 iccv-2013-A New Image Quality Metric for Image Auto-denoising</a></p>

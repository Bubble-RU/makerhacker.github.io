<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jinhui Tang, Min Lin, Liang Lin, Shuicheng Yan, Zhouchen Lin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the robust subspace clustering problem, which aims to cluster the given possibly noisy data points into their underlying subspaces. A large pool of previous subspace clustering methods focus on the graph construction by different regularization of the representation coefficient. We instead focus on the robustness of the model to non-Gaussian noises. We propose a new robust clustering method by using the correntropy induced metric, which is robust for handling the non-Gaussian and impulsive noises. Also we further extend the method for handling the data with outlier rows/features. The multiplicative form of half-quadratic optimization is used to optimize the nonconvex correntropy objective function of the proposed models. Extensive experiments on face datasets well demonstrate that the proposed methods are more robust to corruptions and occlusions.</p><p>3 0.083265632 <a title="412-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Characterizing_Layouts_of_Outdoor_Scenes_Using_Spatial_Topic_Processes.html">72 iccv-2013-Characterizing Layouts of Outdoor Scenes Using Spatial Topic Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Dahua Lin, Jianxiong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generative model to describe the layouts of outdoor scenes the spatial configuration of regions. Specifically, the layout of an image is represented as a composite of regions, each associated with a semantic topic. At the heart of this model is a novel stochastic process called Spatial Topic Process, which generates a spatial map of topics from a set of coupled Gaussian processes, thus allowing the distributions of topics to vary continuously across the image plane. A key aspect that distinguishes this model from previous ones consists in its capability of capturing dependencies across both locations and topics while allowing substantial variations in the layouts. We demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed model by testing it on scene classification, semantic segmentation, and layout hallucination. –</p><p>4 0.076278068 <a title="412-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Co-segmentation_via_Consistent_Functional_Maps.html">208 iccv-2013-Image Co-segmentation via Consistent Functional Maps</a></p>
<p>Author: Fan Wang, Qixing Huang, Leonidas J. Guibas</p><p>Abstract: Joint segmentation of image sets has great importance for object recognition, image classification, and image retrieval. In this paper, we aim to jointly segment a set of images starting from a small number of labeled images or none at all. To allow the images to share segmentation information with each other, we build a network that contains segmented as well as unsegmented images, and extract functional maps between connected image pairs based on image appearance features. These functional maps act as general property transporters between the images and, in particular, are used to transfer segmentations. We define and operate in a reduced functional space optimized so that the functional maps approximately satisfy cycle-consistency under composition in the network. A joint optimization framework is proposed to simultaneously generate all segmentation functions over the images so that they both align with local segmentation cues in each particular image, and agree with each other under network transportation. This formulation allows us to extract segmentations even with no training data, but can also exploit such data when available. The collective effect of the joint processing using functional maps leads to accurate information sharing among images and yields superior segmentation results, as shown on the iCoseg, MSRC, and PASCAL data sets.</p><p>5 0.073617965 <a title="412-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Segmentation_by_Tracking_Many_Figure-Ground_Segments.html">442 iccv-2013-Video Segmentation by Tracking Many Figure-Ground Segments</a></p>
<p>Author: Fuxin Li, Taeyoung Kim, Ahmad Humayun, David Tsai, James M. Rehg</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised video segmentation approach by simultaneously tracking multiple holistic figureground segments. Segment tracks are initialized from a pool of segment proposals generated from a figure-ground segmentation algorithm. Then, online non-local appearance models are trained incrementally for each track using a multi-output regularized least squares formulation. By using the same set of training examples for all segment tracks, a computational trick allows us to track hundreds of segment tracks efficiently, as well as perform optimal online updates in closed-form. Besides, a new composite statistical inference approach is proposed for refining the obtained segment tracks, which breaks down the initial segment proposals and recombines for better ones by utilizing highorder statistic estimates from the appearance model and enforcing temporal consistency. For evaluating the algorithm, a dataset, SegTrack v2, is collected with about 1,000 frames with pixel-level annotations. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in the dataset, show- ing its efficiency and robustness to challenges in different video sequences.</p><p>6 0.069821991 <a title="412-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Low-Rank_Sparse_Coding_for_Image_Classification.html">258 iccv-2013-Low-Rank Sparse Coding for Image Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Alon Faktor, Michal Irani</p><p>Abstract: Given a set of images which share an object from the same semantic category, we would like to co-segment the shared object. We define ‘good’ co-segments to be ones which can be easily composed (like a puzzle) from large pieces of other co-segments, yet are difficult to compose from remaining image parts. These pieces must not only match well but also be statistically significant (hard to compose at random). This gives rise to co-segmentation of objects in very challenging scenarios with large variations in appearance, shape and large amounts of clutter. We further show how multiple images can collaborate and “score each others ’ co-segments to improve the overall fidelity and accuracy of the co-segmentation. Our co-segmentation can be applied both to large image collections, as well as to very few images (where there is too little data for unsupervised learning). At the extreme, it can be applied even to a single image, to extract its co-occurring objects. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. We further show very encouraging co-segmentation results on the challenging PASCAL-VOC dataset. ”</p><p>5 0.67870337 <a title="412-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Bounded_Labeling_Function_for_Global_Segmentation_of_Multi-part_Objects_with_Geometric_Constraints.html">63 iccv-2013-Bounded Labeling Function for Global Segmentation of Multi-part Objects with Geometric Constraints</a></p>

Tsotsos</p><p>Abstract: In graph-based semi-supervised learning approaches, the classification rate is highly dependent on the size of the availabel labeled data, as well as the accuracy of the similarity measures. Here, we propose a semi-supervised multi-class/multi-label classification scheme, dynamic label propagation (DLP), which performs transductive learning through propagation in a dynamic process. Existing semi-supervised classification methods often have difficulty in dealing with multi-class/multi-label problems due to the lack in consideration of label correlation; our algorithm instead emphasizes dynamic metric fusion with label information. Significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods is observed on benchmark datasets for both multiclass and multi-label tasks.</p><p>3 0.62714058 <a title="412-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-New_Graph_Structured_Sparsity_Model_for_Multi-label_Image_Annotations.html">290 iccv-2013-New Graph Structured Sparsity Model for Multi-label Image Annotations</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao Cai, Feiping Nie, Weidong Cai, Heng Huang</p><p>Abstract: In multi-label image annotations, because each image is associated to multiple categories, the semantic terms (label classes) are not mutually exclusive. Previous research showed that such label correlations can largely boost the annotation accuracy. However, all existing methods only directly apply the label correlation matrix to enhance the label inference and assignment without further learning the structural information among classes. In this paper, we model the label correlations using the relational graph, and propose a novel graph structured sparse learning model to incorporate the topological constraints of relation graph in multi-label classifications. As a result, our new method will capture and utilize the hidden class structures in relational graph to improve the annotation results. In proposed objective, a large number of structured sparsity-inducing norms are utilized, thus the optimization becomes difficult. To solve this problem, we derive an efficient optimization algorithm with proved convergence. We perform extensive experiments on six multi-label image annotation benchmark data sets. In all empirical results, our new method shows better annotation results than the state-of-the-art approaches.</p><p>4 0.59227479 <a title="412-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Model_Recommendation_with_Virtual_Probes_for_Egocentric_Hand_Detection.html">267 iccv-2013-Model Recommendation with Virtual Probes for Egocentric Hand Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Cheng Li, Kris M. Kitani</p><p>Abstract: Egocentric cameras can be used to benefit such tasks as analyzing fine motor skills, recognizing gestures and learning about hand-object manipulation. To enable such technology, we believe that the hands must detected on thepixellevel to gain important information about the shape of the hands and fingers. We show that the problem of pixel-wise hand detection can be effectively solved, by posing the problem as a model recommendation task. As such, the goal of a recommendation system is to recommend the n-best hand detectors based on the probe set a small amount of labeled data from the test distribution. This requirement of a probe set is a serious limitation in many applications, such as ego-centric hand detection, where the test distribution may be continually changing. To address this limitation, we propose the use of virtual probes which can be automatically extracted from the test distribution. The key idea is – that many features, such as the color distribution or relative performance between two detectors, can be used as a proxy to the probe set. In our experiments we show that the recommendation paradigm is well-equipped to handle complex changes in the appearance of the hands in firstperson vision. In particular, we show how our system is able to generalize to new scenarios by testing our model across multiple users.</p><p>5 0.57889187 <a title="412-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Set_Classification_Using_Holistic_Multiple_Order_Statistics_Features_and_Localized_Multi-kernel_Metric_Learning.html">212 iccv-2013-Image Set Classification Using Holistic Multiple Order Statistics Features and Localized Multi-kernel Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiwen Lu, Gang Wang, Pierre Moulin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for image set classification, where each training and testing example contains a set of image instances of an object captured from varying viewpoints or under varying illuminations. While a number of image set classification methods have been proposed in recent years, most of them model each image set as a single linear subspace or mixture of linear subspaces, which may lose some discriminative information for classification. To address this, we propose exploring multiple order statistics as features of image sets, and develop a localized multikernel metric learning (LMKML) algorithm to effectively combine different order statistics information for classification. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four widely used databases including the Honda/UCSD, CMU Mobo, and Youtube face datasets, and the ETH-80 object dataset.</p><p>6 0.5560587 <a title="412-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Segmentation_and_Pose_Tracking_of_Human_in_Natural_Videos.html">225 iccv-2013-Joint Segmentation and Pose Tracking of Human in Natural Videos</a></p>

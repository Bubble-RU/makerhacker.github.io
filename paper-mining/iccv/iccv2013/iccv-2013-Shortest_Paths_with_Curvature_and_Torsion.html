</p><p>4 Introduction In differential geometry, the fundamental theorem of curves states that any regular curve in three dimensions with non-zero curvature has its shape completely determined by its curvature and torsion [12]. [sent-12, score-1.895]
</p><p>5 Therefore, for curve recon-  struction problems, it makes sense to regularize the solution with curvature and torsion priors. [sent-13, score-1.251]
</p><p>6 In this paper, we demonstrate that with today’s modern CPUs and clever implementation choices, it is actually possible to solve inverse problems involving both curvature and torsion priors at reasonable running times. [sent-16, score-1.225]
</p><p>7 In [10], it is shown that Euler’s elastica – the line integral of the squared curvature conforms better to intuitive completion of boundary curves. [sent-18, score-0.703]
</p><p>8 Other applications where curvature plays an important role include saliency [17], inpainting [9], stereo [21], region-based image segmentation [15] and surface reconstruction [19]. [sent-19, score-0.682]
</p><p>9 In many applications, the reconstructed –  long with high curvature, but have low torsion as they lie approximately in a plane. [sent-21, score-0.587]
</p><p>10 The coronary arteries are neither short nor have low curvature, but they do have low torsion. [sent-26, score-0.176]
</p><p>11 We follow a classic approach for computing the global minimum of an active contour model based on shortest paths [2, 3]. [sent-29, score-0.194]
</p><p>12 Most of  ×  these methods use only weighted length regularization, even though the idea of applying shortest paths to higher-order functionals involving curvature is not new. [sent-31, score-0.921]
</p><p>13 An extension of the live-wire framework with curvature priors is presented in [20]. [sent-36, score-0.594]
</p><p>14 Many nice examples of the benefits with curvature are given in both [11] and [20], but no running times are reported. [sent-39, score-0.656]
</p><p>15 Our contribution is a global method to find a curve of minimal curvature between two points using  line graphs. [sent-44, score-0.72]
</p><p>16 We are the first to demonstrate practical curvature experiments in 3D and our two-dimensional running times are in the order of seconds. [sent-45, score-0.637]
</p><p>17 Shortest Paths with Curvature and Torsion We are interested in finding a curve γ in two or three dimensions which minimizes an image-dependent functional of its length, curvature and torsion, or more generally:  iγn,Lf? [sent-55, score-0.664]
</p><p>18 (2)  Here κ(s) and τ(s) denote the curvature and the torsion, respectively; see Section 2. [sent-68, score-0.594]
</p><p>19 The scalars ρ, σ and ν are weighting factors of length, curvature and torsion, respectively and can be made image-dependent as well. [sent-70, score-0.594]
</p><p>20 Figure 2: The same path through a mesh (shown in black) repre-  sented in three different ways. [sent-74, score-0.213]
</p><p>21 The shortest path computation is carried out in a graph, consisting of nodes and arcs. [sent-78, score-0.238]
</p><p>22 The mesh is stored explicitly in memory and is the same no matter which regularization is used. [sent-81, score-0.267]
</p><p>23 The simplest case is length regularization (σ = ν = 0), for which the graph is identical to the mesh. [sent-84, score-0.284]
</p><p>24 It follows that we need to consider at least three points to determine the curvature cost. [sent-89, score-0.631]
</p><p>25 To achieve this, a line graph is constructed in which each node corresponds to an edge in the mesh. [sent-90, score-0.171]
</p><p>26 In this manner we can compute the curvature cost of any path through the original mesh. [sent-92, score-0.699]
</p><p>27 Because three points always lie in the same plane, at least four points are needed to determine the torsion cost. [sent-95, score-0.661]
</p><p>28 Figure 2c shows the same path as before, with each node in the graph corresponding to an edge pair in the mesh. [sent-97, score-0.253]
</p><p>29 The graph grows very rapidly in size, but we never construct it explicitly; only the mesh is explicitly created and stored. [sent-98, score-0.176]
</p><p>30 squared curvature as well as the length element ds = ? [sent-114, score-0.749]
</p><p>31 Figure 3 graphs an example curve (a helix), for which the exact curvature and torsion are well known: they are both =  det ? [sent-131, score-1.278]
</p><p>32 Figure 4 shows the error when approximating the curvature and torsion using three and four points, respectively. [sent-142, score-1.181]
</p><p>33 Figure 4: Error when computing the curvature and torsion using the middle point of a spline fit to two or three edges on the curve in Figure 3. [sent-144, score-1.319]
</p><p>34 Our Implementation Dijkstra’s algorithm for computing the shortest path is  well known. [sent-147, score-0.197]
</p><p>35 (ii) An oracle that given a node returns its neighbors and arc weights. [sent-150, score-0.167]
</p><p>36 Each edge and edge pair in the mesh then require 8 and 12 bytes, respectively. [sent-172, score-0.302]
</p><p>37 The array of edges is sorted after the mesh is created, which makes it possible to find the index of a given edge in logarithmic time. [sent-173, score-0.299]
</p><p>38 Then it looks up the edge index for each pair of points in the sorted edge array. [sent-176, score-0.207]
</p><p>39 Instead, the neighbors of an edge pair are computed via the edge neighbors of its last edge as above. [sent-180, score-0.335]
</p><p>40 For example, the curvature cost between two edges is the same even if both edges are translated by the same amount. [sent-182, score-0.706]
</p><p>41 Thus, the integrated curvature needs only •  –  be computed once for each configuration. [sent-183, score-0.612]
</p><p>42 The cache has to be fast, since when working with torsion there are millions of different configurations of two edge pairs. [sent-184, score-0.722]
</p><p>43 Computing the shortest path between two nodes efficiently in parallel is not a trivial task. [sent-189, score-0.238]
</p><p>44 The curvature or torsion cache is filled before the computation starts. [sent-193, score-1.241]
</p><p>45 First, we would like to demonstrate the differences between length, curvature, and torsion with a couple of synthetic experiments. [sent-197, score-0.587]

</p><p>47 Naturally, the heuristic works best for low curvature regularization. [sent-215, score-0.614]
</p><p>48 All of our 2D (3D) experiments are performed with a mesh whose points are arranged in a square (cubic) lattice. [sent-223, score-0.169]
</p><p>49 We manually sampled the river image in Figure 6 at different locations and calculated the data cost for every pixel as the shortest (Euclidean) distance in L*a*b* space to any of the color samples of the river delta. [sent-230, score-0.226]
</p><p>50 Curvature regularization yields a long path which does not turn much. [sent-233, score-0.216]
</p><p>51 No amount of length regularization is able to find that path as indicated by Figure 6a. [sent-234, score-0.341]
</p><p>52 Figure 7 shows an experiment where some edges have been removed around the start and end sets in such a way that the optimal analytical solution is a circle of maximum radius. [sent-236, score-0.172]
</p><p>53 This experiment shows that low regularization radii introduce significant bias when minimizing the squared curvature. [sent-237, score-0.19]
</p><p>54 The underlying mesh has 220,443 points (373 591) and 3,509,756 edges (16-connected). [sent-246, score-0.236]
</p><p>55 Figures (c) and (d) show the order in which the nodes were visited for medium curvature with and without A*, from blue (early) to red (late). [sent-249, score-0.677]
</p><p>56 ference between a curve with curvature regularization and  torsion regularization is given. [sent-251, score-1.521]
</p><p>57 High torsion regularization forces the curve to stay within a plane, but within the plane, the curve may have high length and curvature. [sent-252, score-0.967]
</p><p>58 The graph used for the torsion regularization had about 75 billion arcs. [sent-253, score-0.791]
</p><p>59 2D Retinal Images Automated segmentation of vessels in retinal images is an important problem in medical image analysis, which, for example, can be used when screening for diabetic retinopathy. [sent-257, score-0.256]
</p><p>60 We have investigated whether curvature regularization is useful for this task on a publicly available dataset [18]. [sent-258, score-0.729]
</p><p>61 We iteratively computed shortest paths from a user-provided start point to any point on the image boundary. [sent-260, score-0.221]
</p><p>62 A curve could start anywhere along the previously found curves, but not end close to a previous end point. [sent-261, score-0.2]
</p><p>63 We performed experiments with different amounts of length regularization (Figures 8b–8e). [sent-262, score-0.24]
</p><p>64 No or low length regularization resulted in noisy, wiggling paths. [sent-263, score-0.24]
</p><p>65 This problem expectedly disappeared for medium regularization, but sharp turns were still present in the solution (sharp turns usually change direction in the vessel tree). [sent-264, score-0.302]
</p><p>66 When using too high regularization (Figure 8e), the solution almost ignores the data term and prefers paths along the image boundary. [sent-265, score-0.194]
</p><p>67 Art laln pdo ienntds points have been chosen in such a way that the analytical solution when minimizing the integrated squared curvature is a circle with cost π/10. [sent-270, score-0.753]
</p><p>68 In contrast, curvature regularization is able to more cor-  rectly capture the vessel tree. [sent-271, score-0.938]
</p><p>69 3D Coronary Artery Centerline Extraction Finding the centerlines of coronary arteries is of high clinical importance [14], but is very time consuming when performed manually. [sent-275, score-0.176]
</p><p>70 Each segmentation is initialized by manually specifying the start and end of each vessel information which is included in the dataset. [sent-278, score-0.329]
</p><p>71 To model the vessel we adopt the speed image S from [5], which combines the probability of a voxel being a vessel, measured by “vesselness” [13] and a soft threshold of the image. [sent-280, score-0.231]
</p><p>72 Figure 8: Segmenting a vessel tree with 8 leaves in a 2D retinal image from the DRIVE [18] database. [sent-300, score-0.271]
</p><p>73 The underlying mesh has 329,960 points (584 565) and 10,496,766 edges (32-connected). [sent-302, score-0.236]
</p><p>74 oAnlnl length regularizations (b-d) have various issues and curvature regularization (e) finds a reasonable tree. [sent-305, score-0.864]
</p><p>75 ble 2 presents quantitative result on the training data of [14] and compares length to curvature regularization. [sent-306, score-0.699]
</p><p>76 A example  where curvature regularization outperforms length is given in Figure 9. [sent-307, score-0.834]
</p><p>77 We reconstructed a tree iteratively in the same way as in Figure 8 and, as expected, length regularization introduces similar artifacts. [sent-313, score-0.259]
</p><p>78 Integrating the image along the projected 3D edge gives the edge cost for a single view. [sent-314, score-0.174]

</p><p>80 We segmented each vessel in the training set of [14] with length and curvature regularization. [sent-320, score-0.927]
</p><p>81 For both length and curvature we choose the strength giving the best result and applied it to all vessels. [sent-322, score-0.699]
</p><p>82 The second column reports the number of vessels for which length and curvature performed best, respectively, not  counting any vessel with less than 50% overlap (6 out of 28 vessels) or ties (5 vessels). [sent-323, score-1.014]

</p><p>85 We run the segmentation with either very high curvature (yellow) or very high torsion regularization (red). [sent-349, score-1.359]

</p><p>88 Using length regularization gives similar artifacts (sharp turns) as in Figure 8. [sent-355, score-0.24]
</p><p>89 The underlying mesh has 125,000 points and 24,899,888 edges (218-connectivity). [sent-356, score-0.236]
</p><p>90 Conclusions This paper has demonstrated the possibility of incorporating curvature and torsion to shortest path problems. [sent-362, score-1.378]
</p><p>91 Although all of our methods find the global optimum in polynomial time, using torsion can not be considered feasible, as we have only used it for quite small problems. [sent-365, score-0.587]
</p><p>92 On the other hand, using curvature is not that expensive for many problems and we believe we have demonstrated its usefulness for medical imaging problems, both in 2D (Figure 8) and in 3D (Figure 9). [sent-366, score-0.684]

<p>Author: Carl Olsson, Johannes Ulén, Yuri Boykov, Vladimir Kolmogorov</p><p>Abstract: Energies with high-order non-submodular interactions have been shown to be very useful in vision due to their high modeling power. Optimization of such energies, however, is generally NP-hard. A naive approach that works for small problem instances is exhaustive search, that is, enumeration of all possible labelings of the underlying graph. We propose a general minimization approach for large graphs based on enumeration of labelings of certain small patches. This partial enumeration technique reduces complex highorder energy formulations to pairwise Constraint Satisfaction Problems with unary costs (uCSP), which can be efficiently solved using standard methods like TRW-S. Our approach outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art algorithms on well known difficult problems (e.g. curvature regularization, stereo, deconvolution); it gives near global minimum and better speed. Our main application of interest is curvature regularization. In the context of segmentation, our partial enumeration technique allows to evaluate curvature directly on small patches using a novel integral geometry approach. 1</p><p>3 0.37967208 <a title="389-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-On_the_Mean_Curvature_Flow_on_Graphs_with_Applications_in_Image_and_Manifold_Processing.html">296 iccv-2013-On the Mean Curvature Flow on Graphs with Applications in Image and Manifold Processing</a></p>

We introduce the perimeters on graph using difference operators and define the curvature as the first variation of these perimeters. Our proposed approach of mean curvature unifies both local and non local notions of mean curvature on Euclidean domains. Furthermore, it allows the extension to the processing of manifolds and data which can be represented by graphs.</p><p>4 0.20093402 <a title="389-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Tree_Shape_Priors_with_Connectivity_Constraints_Using_Convex_Relaxation_on_General_Graphs.html">429 iccv-2013-Tree Shape Priors with Connectivity Constraints Using Convex Relaxation on General Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan Stühmer, Peter Schröder, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to include a connectivity prior into image segmentation that is based on a binary labeling of a directed graph, in this case a geodesic shortest path tree. Specifically we make two contributions: First, we construct a geodesic shortest path tree with a distance measure that is related to the image data and the bending energy of each path in the tree. Second, we include a connectivity prior in our segmentation model, that allows to segment not only a single elongated structure, but instead a whole connected branching tree. Because both our segmentation model and the connectivity constraint are convex, a global optimal solution can be found. To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure. To validate our method we present results on data from medical imaging in angiography and retinal blood vessel segmentation.</p><p>5 0.19977081 <a title="389-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Curvature-Aware_Regularization_on_Riemannian_Submanifolds.html">100 iccv-2013-Curvature-Aware Regularization on Riemannian Submanifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Kwang In Kim, James Tompkin, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: One fundamental assumption in object recognition as well as in other computer vision and pattern recognition problems is that the data generation process lies on a manifold and that it respects the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. This assumption is held in several successful algorithms for diffusion and regularization, in particular, in graph-Laplacian-based algorithms. We claim that the performance of existing algorithms can be improved if we additionally account for how the manifold is embedded within the ambient space, i.e., if we consider the extrinsic geometry of the manifold. We present a procedure for characterizing the extrinsic (as well as intrinsic) curvature of a manifold M which is described by a sampled point cloud in a high-dimensional Euclidean space.

We use shortest paths to minimize very general functionals of higher-order curve properties, such as curvature and torsion.

We introduce the perimeters on graph using difference operators and define the curvature as the first variation of these perimeters. Our proposed approach of mean curvature unifies both local and non local notions of mean curvature on Euclidean domains. Furthermore, it allows the extension to the processing of manifolds and data which can be represented by graphs.</p><p>3 0.88622075 <a title="389-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Partial_Enumeration_and_Curvature_Regularization.html">309 iccv-2013-Partial Enumeration and Curvature Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Olsson, Johannes Ulén, Yuri Boykov, Vladimir Kolmogorov</p><p>Abstract: Energies with high-order non-submodular interactions have been shown to be very useful in vision due to their high modeling power. Optimization of such energies, however, is generally NP-hard. A naive approach that works for small problem instances is exhaustive search, that is, enumeration of all possible labelings of the underlying graph. We propose a general minimization approach for large graphs based on enumeration of labelings of certain small patches. This partial enumeration technique reduces complex highorder energy formulations to pairwise Constraint Satisfaction Problems with unary costs (uCSP), which can be efficiently solved using standard methods like TRW-S. Our approach outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art algorithms on well known difficult problems (e.g. curvature regularization, stereo, deconvolution); it gives near global minimum and better speed. Our main application of interest is curvature regularization. In the context of segmentation, our partial enumeration technique allows to evaluate curvature directly on small patches using a novel integral geometry approach. 1</p><p>4 0.70081097 <a title="389-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Curvature-Aware_Regularization_on_Riemannian_Submanifolds.html">100 iccv-2013-Curvature-Aware Regularization on Riemannian Submanifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Kwang In Kim, James Tompkin, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: One fundamental assumption in object recognition as well as in other computer vision and pattern recognition problems is that the data generation process lies on a manifold and that it respects the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. This assumption is held in several successful algorithms for diffusion and regularization, in particular, in graph-Laplacian-based algorithms. We claim that the performance of existing algorithms can be improved if we additionally account for how the manifold is embedded within the ambient space, i.e., if we consider the extrinsic geometry of the manifold. We present a procedure for characterizing the extrinsic (as well as intrinsic) curvature of a manifold M which is described by a sampled point cloud in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Once estimated, we use this characterization in general diffusion and regularization on M, and form a new regularizer on a point cloud. The resulting re-weighted graph Laplacian demonstrates superior performance over classical graph Laplacian in semisupervised learning and spectral clustering.</p><p>5 0.4942275 <a title="389-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Tree_Shape_Priors_with_Connectivity_Constraints_Using_Convex_Relaxation_on_General_Graphs.html">429 iccv-2013-Tree Shape Priors with Connectivity Constraints Using Convex Relaxation on General Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan Stühmer, Peter Schröder, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to include a connectivity prior into image segmentation that is based on a binary labeling of a directed graph, in this case a geodesic shortest path tree. Specifically we make two contributions: First, we construct a geodesic shortest path tree with a distance measure that is related to the image data and the bending energy of each path in the tree. Second, we include a connectivity prior in our segmentation model, that allows to segment not only a single elongated structure, but instead a whole connected branching tree. Because both our segmentation model and the connectivity constraint are convex, a global optimal solution can be found. To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure. To validate our method we present results on data from medical imaging in angiography and retinal blood vessel segmentation.</p><p>6 0.31027141 <a title="389-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Potts_Model%2C_Parametric_Maxflow_and_K-Submodular_Functions.html">324 iccv-2013-Potts Model, Parametric Maxflow and K-Submodular Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicolas Martin, Vincent Couture, Sébastien Roy</p><p>Abstract: We present a scanning method that recovers dense subpixel camera-projector correspondence without requiring any photometric calibration nor preliminary knowledge of their relative geometry. Subpixel accuracy is achieved by considering several zero-crossings defined by the difference between pairs of unstructured patterns. We use gray-level band-pass white noise patterns that increase robustness to indirect lighting and scene discontinuities. Simulated and experimental results show that our method recovers scene geometry with high subpixel precision, and that it can handle many challenges of active reconstruction systems. We compare our results to state of the art methods such as micro phase shifting and modulated phase shifting.</p><p>3 0.75282669 <a title="389-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Camera_Alignment_Using_Trajectory_Intersections_in_Unsynchronized_Videos.html">68 iccv-2013-Camera Alignment Using Trajectory Intersections in Unsynchronized Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Kuo, Santhoshkumar Sunderrajan, B.S. Manjunath</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the novel and challenging problem of aligning camera views that are unsynchronized by low and/or variable frame rates using object trajectories. Unlike existing trajectory-based alignment methods, our method does not require frame-to-frame synchronization. Instead, we propose using the intersections of corresponding object trajectories to match views. To find these intersections, we introduce a novel trajectory matching algorithm based on matching Spatio-Temporal Context Graphs (STCGs). These graphs represent the distances between trajectories in time and space within a view, and are matched to an STCG from another view to find the corresponding trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to align views that are unsynchronized with variable frame rates. The results on simulated and real-world datasets show trajectory intersections area viablefeatureforcamera alignment, and that the trajectory matching method performs well in real-world scenarios.</p><p>4 0.72866023 <a title="389-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Nonparametric_Blind_Super-resolution.html">293 iccv-2013-Nonparametric Blind Super-resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Tomer Michaeli, Michal Irani</p><p>Abstract: Super resolution (SR) algorithms typically assume that the blur kernel is known (either the Point Spread Function ‘PSF’ of the camera, or some default low-pass filter, e.g. a Gaussian). However, the performance of SR methods significantly deteriorates when the assumed blur kernel deviates from the true one. We propose a general framework for “blind” super resolution. In particular, we show that: (i) Unlike the common belief, the PSF of the camera is the wrong blur kernel to use in SR algorithms. (ii) We show how the correct SR blur kernel can be recovered directly from the low-resolution image. This is done by exploiting the inherent recurrence property of small natural image patches (either internally within the same image, or externally in a collection of other natural images). In particular, we show that recurrence of small patches across scales of the low-res image (which forms the basis for single-image SR), can also be used for estimating the optimal blur kernel. This leads to significant improvement in SR results.</p><p>5 0.6921382 <a title="389-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Event_Recognition_in_Photo_Collections_with_a_Stopwatch_HMM.html">147 iccv-2013-Event Recognition in Photo Collections with a Stopwatch HMM</a></p>
<p>Author: Lukas Bossard, Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: The task of recognizing events in photo collections is central for automatically organizing images. It is also very challenging, because of the ambiguity of photos across different event classes and because many photos do not convey enough relevant information. Unfortunately, the field still lacks standard evaluation data sets to allow comparison of different approaches. In this paper, we introduce and release a novel data set of personal photo collections containing more than 61,000 images in 807 collections, annotated with 14 diverse social event classes. Casting collections as sequential data, we build upon recent and state-of-the-art work in event recognition in videos to propose a latent sub-event approach for event recognition in photo collections. However, photos in collections are sparsely sampled over time and come in bursts from which transpires the importance of specific moments for the photographers. Thus, we adapt a discriminative hidden Markov model to allow the transitions between states to be a function of the time gap between consecutive images, which we coin as Stopwatch Hidden Markov model (SHMM). In our experiments, we show that our proposed model outperforms approaches based only on feature pooling or a classical hidden Markov model. With an average accuracy of 56%, we also highlight the difficulty of the data set and the need for future advances in event recognition in photo collections.</p><p>6 0.66912264 <a title="389-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Scene_Text_Localization_and_Recognition_with_Oriented_Stroke_Detection.html">376 iccv-2013-Scene Text Localization and Recognition with Oriented Stroke Detection</a></p>

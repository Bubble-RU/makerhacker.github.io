<p>Author: Fatemeh Mirrashed, Mohammad Rastegari</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method that exploits intrinsic compact structures of categories across different domains using binary attributes. Our method directly optimizes for classification in the target domain. The key insight is finding attributes that are discriminative across categories and predictable across domains. We achieve a performance that significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. In fact, in many cases, our method reaches the same-domain performance, the upper bound, in unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios.</p><p>3 0.12362412 <a title="431-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Write_a_Classifier%3A_Zero-Shot_Learning_Using_Purely_Textual_Descriptions.html">451 iccv-2013-Write a Classifier: Zero-Shot Learning Using Purely Textual Descriptions</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohamed Elhoseiny, Babak Saleh, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: The main question we address in this paper is how to use purely textual description of categories with no training images to learn visual classifiers for these categories. We propose an approach for zero-shot learning of object categories where the description of unseen categories comes in the form of typical text such as an encyclopedia entry, without the need to explicitly defined attributes. We propose and investigate two baseline formulations, based on regression and domain adaptation. Then, we propose a new constrained optimization formulation that combines a regression function and a knowledge transfer function with additional constraints to predict the classifier parameters for new classes. We applied the proposed approach on two fine-grained categorization datasets, and the results indicate successful classifier prediction.</p><p>4 0.099601716 <a title="431-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_Practical_Transfer_Learning_Algorithm_for_Face_Verification.html">26 iccv-2013-A Practical Transfer Learning Algorithm for Face Verification</a></p>
<p>Author: Xudong Cao, David Wipf, Fang Wen, Genquan Duan, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: Face verification involves determining whether a pair of facial images belongs to the same or different subjects. This problem can prove to be quite challenging in many important applications where labeled training data is scarce, e.g., family album photo organization software. Herein we propose a principled transfer learning approach for merging plentiful source-domain data with limited samples from some target domain of interest to create a classifier that ideally performs nearly as well as if rich target-domain data were present. Based upon a surprisingly simple generative Bayesian model, our approach combines a KL-divergencebased regularizer/prior with a robust likelihood function leading to a scalable implementation via the EM algorithm. As justification for our design choices, we later use principles from convex analysis to recast our algorithm as an equivalent structured rank minimization problem leading to a number of interesting insights related to solution structure and feature-transform invariance. These insights help to both explain the effectiveness of our algorithm as well as elucidate a wide variety of related Bayesian approaches. Experimental testing with challenging datasets validate the utility of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>5 0.093689077 <a title="431-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Visual_Domain_Adaptation_Using_Subspace_Alignment.html">438 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Visual Domain Adaptation Using Subspace Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Basura Fernando, Amaury Habrard, Marc Sebban, Tinne Tuytelaars</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new domain adaptation (DA) algorithm where the source and target domains are represented by subspaces described by eigenvectors. In this context, our method seeks a domain adaptation solution by learning a mapping function which aligns the source subspace with the target one. We show that the solution of the corresponding optimization problem can be obtained in a simple closed form, leading to an extremely fast algorithm. We use a theoretical result to tune the unique hyperparameter corresponding to the size of the subspaces. We run our method on various datasets and show that, despite its intrinsic simplicity, it outperforms state of the art DA methods.</p><p>6 0.093628019 <a title="431-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Similarity_Metric_Learning_for_Face_Recognition.html">392 iccv-2013-Similarity Metric Learning for Face Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Yangqing Jia, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of large-scale image classification systems that are able to identify objects among thousands of possible labels. However, it is yet unclear how general classifiers such as ones trained on ImageNet can be optimally adapted to specific tasks, each of which only covers a semantically related subset of all the objects in the world. It is inefficient and suboptimal to retrain classifiers whenever a new task is given, and is inapplicable when tasks are not given explicitly, but implicitly specified as a set of image queries. In this paper we propose a novel probabilistic model that jointly identifies the underlying task and performs prediction with a lineartime probabilistic inference algorithm, given a set of query images from a latent task. We present efficient ways to estimate parameters for the model, and an open-source toolbox to train classifiers distributedly at a large scale. Empirical results based on the ImageNet data showed significant performance increase over several baseline algorithms.</p><p>3 0.77822572 <a title="431-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_to_Rank_Using_Privileged_Information.html">248 iccv-2013-Learning to Rank Using Privileged Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Viktoriia Sharmanska, Novi Quadrianto, Christoph H. Lampert</p><p>Abstract: Many computer visionproblems have an asymmetric distribution of information between training and test time. In this work, we study the case where we are given additional information about the training data, which however will not be available at test time. This situation is called learning using privileged information (LUPI). We introduce two maximum-margin techniques that are able to make use of this additional source of information, and we show that the framework is applicable to several scenarios that have been studied in computer vision before. Experiments with attributes, bounding boxes, image tags and rationales as additional information in object classification show promising results.</p><p>4 0.77594697 <a title="431-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-From_Point_to_Set%3A_Extend_the_Learning_of_Distance_Metrics.html">177 iccv-2013-From Point to Set: Extend the Learning of Distance Metrics</a></p>
<p>Author: Pengfei Zhu, Lei Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Most of the current metric learning methods are proposed for point-to-point distance (PPD) based classification. In many computer vision tasks, however, we need to measure the point-to-set distance (PSD) and even set-to-set distance (SSD) for classification. In this paper, we extend the PPD based Mahalanobis distance metric learning to PSD and SSD based ones, namely point-to-set distance metric learning (PSDML) and set-to-set distance metric learning (SSDML), and solve them under a unified optimization framework. First, we generate positive and negative sample pairs by computing the PSD and SSD between training samples. Then, we characterize each sample pair by its covariance matrix, and propose a covariance kernel based discriminative function. Finally, we tackle the PSDML and SSDMLproblems by using standard support vector machine solvers, making the metric learning very efficient for multiclass visual classification tasks. Experiments on gender classification, digit recognition, object categorization and face recognition show that the proposed metric learning methods can effectively enhance the performance of PSD and SSD based classification.</p><p>5 0.75987428 <a title="431-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Frustratingly_Easy_NBNN_Domain_Adaptation.html">181 iccv-2013-Frustratingly Easy NBNN Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tatiana Tommasi, Barbara Caputo</p><p>Abstract: Over the last years, several authors have signaled that state of the art categorization methods fail to perform well when trained and tested on data from different databases. The general consensus in the literature is that this issue, known as domain adaptation and/or dataset bias, is due to a distribution mismatch between data collections. Methods addressing it go from max-margin classifiers to learning how to modify the features and obtain a more robust representation. The large majority of these works use BOW feature descriptors, and learning methods based on imageto-image distance functions. Following the seminal work of [6], in this paper we challenge these two assumptions. We experimentally show that using the NBNN classifier over existing domain adaptation databases achieves always very strong performances. We build on this result, and present an NBNN-based domain adaptation algorithm that learns iteratively a class metric while inducing, for each sample, a large margin separation among classes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work casting the domain adaptation problem within the NBNN framework. Experiments show that our method achieves the state of the art, both in the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.</p><p>6 0.72560078 <a title="431-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Quadruplet-Wise_Image_Similarity_Learning.html">332 iccv-2013-Quadruplet-Wise Image Similarity Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Chih-Yuan Yang, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: The goal of single-image super-resolution is to generate a high-quality high-resolution image based on a given low-resolution input. It is an ill-posed problem which requires exemplars or priors to better reconstruct the missing high-resolution image details. In this paper, we propose to split the feature space into numerous subspaces and collect exemplars to learn priors for each subspace, thereby creating effective mapping functions. The use of split input space facilitates both feasibility of using simple functionsfor super-resolution, and efficiency ofgenerating highresolution results. High-quality high-resolution images are reconstructed based on the effective learned priors.

Jane Wang</p><p>Abstract: Digital images nowadays show large appearance variabilities on picture styles, in terms of color tone, contrast, vignetting, and etc. These ‘picture styles’ are directly related to the scene radiance, image pipeline of the camera, and post processing functions (e.g., photography effect filters). Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of these factors, popular gradient-based image descriptors generally are not invariant to different picture styles, which could degrade the performance for object recognition. Given that images shared online or created by individual users are taken with a wide range of devices and may be processed by various post processing functions, to find a robust object recognition system is useful and challenging. In this paper, we investigate the influence of picture styles on object recognition by making a connection between image descriptors and a pixel mapping function g, and accordingly propose an adaptive approach based on a g-incorporated kernel descriptor and multiple kernel learning, without estimating or specifying the image styles used in training and testing. We conduct experiments on the Domain Adaptation data set, the Oxford Flower data set, and several variants of the Flower data set by introducing popular photography effects through post-processing. The results demonstrate that theproposedmethod consistently yields recognition improvements over standard descriptors in all studied cases.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.7576893 <a title="431-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Unbiased_Metric_Learning%3A_On_the_Utilization_of_Multiple_Datasets_and_Web_Images_for_Softening_Bias.html">431 iccv-2013-Unbiased Metric Learning: On the Utilization of Multiple Datasets and Web Images for Softening Bias</a></p>
<p>Author: Chen Fang, Ye Xu, Daniel N. Rockmore</p><p>Abstract: Many standard computer vision datasets exhibit biases due to a variety of sources including illumination condition, imaging system, and preference of dataset collectors. Biases like these can have downstream effects in the use of vision datasets in the construction of generalizable techniques, especially for the goal of the creation of a classification system capable of generalizing to unseen and novel datasets. In this work we propose Unbiased Metric Learning (UML), a metric learning approach, to achieve this goal. UML operates in the following two steps: (1) By varying hyperparameters, it learns a set of less biased candidate distance metrics on training examples from multiple biased datasets. The key idea is to learn a neighborhood for each example, which consists of not only examples of the same category from the same dataset, but those from other datasets. The learning framework is based on structural SVM. (2) We do model validation on a set of weakly-labeled web images retrieved by issuing class labels as keywords to search engine. The metric with best validationperformance is selected. Although the web images sometimes have noisy labels, they often tend to be less biased, which makes them suitable for the validation set in our task. Cross-dataset image classification experiments are carried out. Results show significant performance improvement on four well-known computer vision datasets.</p><p>4 0.72914398 <a title="431-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Pose-Free_Facial_Landmark_Fitting_via_Optimized_Part_Mixtures_and_Cascaded_Deformable_Shape_Model.html">321 iccv-2013-Pose-Free Facial Landmark Fitting via Optimized Part Mixtures and Cascaded Deformable Shape Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiang Yu, Junzhou Huang, Shaoting Zhang, Wang Yan, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of facial landmark localization and tracking from a single camera. We present a two-stage cascaded deformable shape model to effectively and efficiently localize facial landmarks with large head pose variations. For face detection, we propose a group sparse learning method to automatically select the most salient facial landmarks. By introducing 3D face shape model, we use procrustes analysis to achieve pose-free facial landmark initialization. For deformation, the first step uses mean-shift local search with constrained local model to rapidly approach the global optimum. The second step uses component-wise active contours to discriminatively refine the subtle shape variation. Our framework can simultaneously handle face detection, pose-free landmark localization and tracking in real time. Extensive experiments are conducted on both laboratory environmental face databases and face-in-the-wild databases. All results demonstrate that our approach has certain advantages over state-of-theart methods in handling pose variations1.</p><p>5 0.71982718 <a title="431-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Joint_Intensity_and_Depth_Co-sparse_Analysis_Model_for_Depth_Map_Super-resolution.html">18 iccv-2013-A Joint Intensity and Depth Co-sparse Analysis Model for Depth Map Super-resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Kiechle, Simon Hawe, Martin Kleinsteuber</p><p>Abstract: High-resolution depth maps can be inferred from lowresolution depth measurements and an additional highresolution intensity image of the same scene. To that end, we introduce a bimodal co-sparse analysis model, which is able to capture the interdependency of registered intensity . go l e i um . de . .t ities together with the knowledge of the relative positions between all views. Despite very active research in this area and significant improvements over the past years, stereo methods still struggle with noise, texture-less regions, repetitive texture, and occluded areas. For an overview of stereo methods, the reader is referred to [25]. and depth information. This model is based on the assumption that the co-supports of corresponding bimodal image structures are aligned when computed by a suitable pair of analysis operators. No analytic form of such operators ex- ist and we propose a method for learning them from a set of registered training signals. This learning process is done offline and returns a bimodal analysis operator that is universally applicable to natural scenes. We use this to exploit the bimodal co-sparse analysis model as a prior for solving inverse problems, which leads to an efficient algorithm for depth map super-resolution.</p><p>6 0.71832711 <a title="431-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Example-Based_Super-Resolution.html">51 iccv-2013-Anchored Neighborhood Regression for Fast Example-Based Super-Resolution</a></p>

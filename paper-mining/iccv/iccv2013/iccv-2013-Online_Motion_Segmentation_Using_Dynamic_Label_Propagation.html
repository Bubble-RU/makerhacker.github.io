<p>Author: Jiaming Guo, Zhuwen Li, Loong-Fah Cheong, Steven Zhiying Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Given a pair of videos having a common action, our goal is to simultaneously segment this pair of videos to extract this common action. As a preprocessing step, we first remove background trajectories by a motion-based figureground segmentation. To remove the remaining background and those extraneous actions, we propose the trajectory cosaliency measure, which captures the notion that trajectories recurring in all the videos should have their mutual saliency boosted. This requires a trajectory matching process which can compare trajectories with different lengths and not necessarily spatiotemporally aligned, and yet be discriminative enough despite significant intra-class variation in the common action. We further leverage the graph matching to enforce geometric coherence between regions so as to reduce feature ambiguity and matching errors. Finally, to classify the trajectories into common action and action outliers, we formulate the problem as a binary labeling of a Markov Random Field, in which the data term is measured by the trajectory co-saliency and the smooth- ness term is measured by the spatiotemporal consistency between trajectories.

<p>Author: Feng Shi, Zhong Zhou, Jiangjian Xiao, Wei Wu</p><p>Abstract: Due to occlusions and objects ’ non-rigid deformation in the scene, the obtained motion trajectories from common trackers may contain a number of missing or mis-associated entries. To cluster such corrupted point based trajectories into multiple motions is still a hard problem. In this paper, we present an approach that exploits temporal and spatial characteristics from tracked points to facilitate segmentation of incomplete and corrupted trajectories, thereby obtain highly robust results against severe data missing and noises. Our method first uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) bases as a temporal smoothness constraint on trajectory projection to ensure the validity of resulting components to repair pathological trajectories. Then, based on an observation that the trajectories of foreground and background in a scene may have different spatial distributions, we propose a two-stage clustering strategy that first performs foreground-background separation then segments remaining foreground trajectories. We show that, with this new clustering strategy, sequences with complex motions can be accurately segmented by even using a simple trans- lational model. Finally, a series of experiments on Hopkins 155 dataset andBerkeley motion segmentation dataset show the advantage of our method over other state-of-the-art motion segmentation algorithms in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.</p><p>4 0.42627004 <a title="297-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Camera_Alignment_Using_Trajectory_Intersections_in_Unsynchronized_Videos.html">68 iccv-2013-Camera Alignment Using Trajectory Intersections in Unsynchronized Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Kuo, Santhoshkumar Sunderrajan, B.S. Manjunath</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the novel and challenging problem of aligning camera views that are unsynchronized by low and/or variable frame rates using object trajectories. Unlike existing trajectory-based alignment methods, our method does not require frame-to-frame synchronization. Instead, we propose using the intersections of corresponding object trajectories to match views. To find these intersections, we introduce a novel trajectory matching algorithm based on matching Spatio-Temporal Context Graphs (STCGs). These graphs represent the distances between trajectories in time and space within a view, and are matched to an STCG from another view to find the corresponding trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to align views that are unsynchronized with variable frame rates. The results on simulated and real-world datasets show trajectory intersections area viablefeatureforcamera alignment, and that the trajectory matching method performs well in real-world scenarios.</p><p>5 0.36589891 <a title="297-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Action_Recognition_with_Improved_Trajectories.html">39 iccv-2013-Action Recognition with Improved Trajectories</a></p>
<p>Author: Heng Wang, Cordelia Schmid</p><p>Abstract: Recently dense trajectories were shown to be an efficient video representation for action recognition and achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets. This paper improves their performance by taking into account camera motion to correct them. To estimate camera motion, we match feature points between frames using SURF descriptors and dense optical flow, which are shown to be complementary. These matches are, then, used to robustly estimate a homography with RANSAC. Human motion is in general different from camera motion and generates inconsistent matches. To improve the estimation, a human detector is employed to remove these matches. Given the estimated camera motion, we remove trajectories consistent with it. We also use this estimation to cancel out camera motion from the optical flow. This significantly improves motion-based descriptors, such as HOF and MBH. Experimental results onfour challenging action datasets (i.e., Hollywood2, HMDB51, Olympic Sports and UCF50) significantly outperform the current state of the art.</p><p>6 0.32164669 <a title="297-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Inferring_%22Dark_Matter%22_and_%22Dark_Energy%22_from_Videos.html">216 iccv-2013-Inferring "Dark Matter" and "Dark Energy" from Videos</a></p>

<p>Author: Dan Xie, Sinisa Todorovic, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach to localizing functional objects in surveillance videos without domain knowledge about semantic object classes that may appear in the scene. Functional objects do not have discriminative appearance and shape, but they affect behavior of people in the scene. For example, they “attract” people to approach them for satisfying certain needs (e.g., vending machines could quench thirst), or “repel” people to avoid them (e.g., grass lawns). Therefore, functional objects can be viewed as “dark matter”, emanating “dark energy ” that affects people ’s trajectories in the video. To detect “dark matter” and infer their “dark energy ” field, we extend the Lagrangian mechanics. People are treated as particle-agents with latent intents to approach “dark matter” and thus satisfy their needs, where their motions are subject to a composite “dark energy ” field of all functional objects in the scene. We make the assumption that people take globally optimal paths toward the intended “dark matter” while avoiding latent obstacles. A Bayesian framework is used to probabilistically model: people ’s trajectories and intents, constraint map of the scene, and locations of functional objects. A data-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process is used for inference. Our evaluation on videos of public squares and courtyards demonstrates our effectiveness in localizing functional objects and predicting people ’s trajectories in unobserved parts of the video footage.</p><p>6 0.69187629 <a title="297-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Measuring_Flow_Complexity_in_Videos.html">263 iccv-2013-Measuring Flow Complexity in Videos</a></p>

<p>Author: Sergio Guadarrama, Niveda Krishnamoorthy, Girish Malkarnenkar, Subhashini Venugopalan, Raymond Mooney, Trevor Darrell, Kate Saenko</p><p>Abstract: Despite a recent push towards large-scale object recognition, activity recognition remains limited to narrow domains and small vocabularies of actions. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of recognizing and describing activities “in-the-wild”. We present a solution that takes a short video clip and outputs a brief sentence that sums up the main activity in the video, such as the actor, the action and its object. Unlike previous work, our approach works on out-of-domain actions: it does not require training videos of the exact activity. If it cannot find an accurate prediction for a pre-trained model, it finds a less specific answer that is also plausible from a pragmatic standpoint. We use semantic hierarchies learned from the data to help to choose an appropriate level of generalization, and priors learned from web-scale natural language corpora to penalize unlikely combinations of actors/actions/objects; we also use a web-scale language model to “fill in ” novel verbs, i.e. when the verb does not appear in the training set. We evaluate our method on a large YouTube corpus and demonstrate it is able to generate short sentence descriptions of video clips better than baseline approaches.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.74249738 <a title="297-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Motion_Segmentation_Using_Dynamic_Label_Propagation.html">297 iccv-2013-Online Motion Segmentation Using Dynamic Label Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Elqursh, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: The vast majority of work on motion segmentation adopts the affine camera model due to its simplicity. Under the affine model, the motion segmentation problem becomes that of subspace separation. Due to this assumption, such methods are mainly offline and exhibit poor performance when the assumption is not satisfied. This is made evident in state-of-the-art methods that relax this assumption by using piecewise affine spaces and spectral clustering techniques to achieve better results. In this paper, we formulate the problem of motion segmentation as that of manifold separation. We then show how label propagation can be used in an online framework to achieve manifold separation. The performance of our framework is evaluated on a benchmark dataset and achieves competitive performance while being online.</p><p>4 0.73299664 <a title="297-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_to_Predict_Gaze_in_Egocentric_Video.html">247 iccv-2013-Learning to Predict Gaze in Egocentric Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Yin Li, Alireza Fathi, James M. Rehg</p><p>Abstract: We present a model for gaze prediction in egocentric video by leveraging the implicit cues that exist in camera wearer’s behaviors. Specifically, we compute the camera wearer’s head motion and hand location from the video and combine them to estimate where the eyes look. We further model the dynamic behavior of the gaze, in particular fixations, as latent variables to improve the gaze prediction. Our gaze prediction results outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin on publicly available egocentric vision datasets. In addition, we demonstrate that we get a significant performance boost in recognizing daily actions and segmenting foreground objects by plugging in our gaze predictions into state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.72690004 <a title="297-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Face_Landmark_Estimation_under_Occlusion.html">355 iccv-2013-Robust Face Landmark Estimation under Occlusion</a></p>
<p>Author: Xavier P. Burgos-Artizzu, Pietro Perona, Piotr Dollár</p><p>Abstract: Human faces captured in real-world conditions present large variations in shape and occlusions due to differences in pose, expression, use of accessories such as sunglasses and hats and interactions with objects (e.g. food). Current face landmark estimation approaches struggle under such conditions since theyfail toprovide aprincipled way ofhandling outliers. We propose a novel method, called Robust Cascaded Pose Regression (RCPR) which reduces exposure to outliers by detecting occlusions explicitly and using robust shape-indexed features. We show that RCPR improves on previous landmark estimation methods on three popular face datasets (LFPW, LFW and HELEN). We further explore RCPR ’s performance by introducing a novel face dataset focused on occlusion, composed of 1,007 faces presenting a wide range of occlusion patterns. RCPR reduces failure cases by half on all four datasets, at the same time as it detects face occlusions with a 80/40% precision/recall.</p><p>6 0.72518116 <a title="297-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Noise_Level_Estimation_from_Personal_Photo_Collections.html">223 iccv-2013-Joint Noise Level Estimation from Personal Photo Collections</a></p>

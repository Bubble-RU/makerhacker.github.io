<p>Author: Stefanos Zafeiriou, Irene Kotsia</p><p>Abstract: Kernels have been a common tool of machine learning and computer vision applications for modeling nonlinearities and/or the design of robust1 similarity measures between objects. Arguably, the class of positive semidefinite (psd) kernels, widely known as Mercer’s Kernels, constitutes one of the most well-studied cases. For every psd kernel there exists an associated feature map to an arbitrary dimensional Hilbert space H, the so-called feature space.

Recently, due to the development of very efficient solutions for large scale linear SVMs and for incremental linear component analysis, the research to- wards finding feature map approximations for classes of kernels has attracted significant interest. In this paper, we attempt the derivation of explicit feature maps of a recently proposed class of kernels, the so-called one-shot similarity kernels. We show that for this class of kernels either there exists an explicit representation in feature space or the kernel can be expressed in such a form that allows for exact incremental learning.

<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for 2D shape analysis using positive definite kernels defined on Kendall’s shape manifold. Different representations of 2D shapes are known to generate different nonlinear spaces. Due to the nonlinearity of these spaces, most existing shape classification algorithms resort to nearest neighbor methods and to learning distances on shape spaces. Here, we propose to map shapes on Kendall’s shape manifold to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To this end, we introduce a kernel on this manifold that permits such a mapping, and prove its positive definiteness. This kernel lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM, MKL and kernel PCA, to the shape manifold. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods on shape classification, clustering and retrieval.</p><p>4 0.10325356 <a title="212-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Similarity_Metric_Learning_for_Face_Recognition.html">392 iccv-2013-Similarity Metric Learning for Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiong Cao, Yiming Ying, Peng Li</p><p>Abstract: Recently, there is a considerable amount of efforts devoted to the problem of unconstrained face verification, where the task is to predict whether pairs of images are from the same person or not. This problem is challenging and difficult due to the large variations in face images. In this paper, we develop a novel regularization framework to learn similarity metrics for unconstrained face verification. We formulate its objective function by incorporating the robustness to the large intra-personal variations and the discriminative power of novel similarity metrics. In addition, our formulation is a convex optimization problem which guarantees the existence of its global solution. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on the challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) database [10].</p><p>5 0.10240828 <a title="212-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Compositional_Models_for_Video_Event_Detection%3A_A_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_Latent_Variable_Approach.html">85 iccv-2013-Compositional Models for Video Event Detection: A Multiple Kernel Learning Latent Variable Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Arash Vahdat, Kevin Cannons, Greg Mori, Sangmin Oh, Ilseo Kim</p><p>Abstract: We present a compositional model for video event detection. A video is modeled using a collection of both global and segment-level features and kernel functions are employed for similarity comparisons. The locations of salient, discriminative video segments are treated as a latent variable, allowing the model to explicitly ignore portions of the video that are unimportant for classification. A novel, multiple kernel learning (MKL) latent support vector machine (SVM) is defined, that is used to combine and re-weight multiple feature types in a principled fashion while simultaneously operating within the latent variable framework. The compositional nature of the proposed model allows it to respond directly to the challenges of temporal clutter and intra-class variation, which are prevalent in unconstrained internet videos. Experimental results on the TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection 2011 (MED11) dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the method.</p><p>6 0.082139112 <a title="212-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Combining_the_Right_Features_for_Complex_Event_Recognition.html">81 iccv-2013-Combining the Right Features for Complex Event Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Zheyun Feng, Rong Jin, Anil Jain</p><p>Abstract: One of the key challenges in search-based image annotation models is to define an appropriate similarity measure between images. Many kernel distance metric learning (KML) algorithms have been developed in order to capture the nonlinear relationships between visual features and semantics ofthe images. Onefundamental limitation in applying KML to image annotation is that it requires converting image annotations into binary constraints, leading to a significant information loss. In addition, most KML algorithms suffer from high computational cost due to the requirement that the learned matrix has to be positive semi-definitive (PSD). In this paper, we propose a robust kernel metric learning (RKML) algorithm based on the regression technique that is able to directly utilize image annotations. The proposed method is also computationally more efficient because PSD property is automatically ensured by regression. We provide the theoretical guarantee for the proposed algorithm, and verify its efficiency and effectiveness for image annotation by comparing it to state-of-the-art approaches for both distance metric learning and image annotation. ,</p><p>3 0.78213859 <a title="212-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-On_One-Shot_Similarity_Kernels%3A_Explicit_Feature_Maps_and_Properties.html">295 iccv-2013-On One-Shot Similarity Kernels: Explicit Feature Maps and Properties</a></p>

<p>Author: Peihua Li, Qilong Wang, Wangmeng Zuo, Lei Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The symmetric positive de?nite (SPD) matrices have been widely used in image and vision problems. Recently there are growing interests in studying sparse representation (SR) of SPD matrices, motivated by the great success of SR for vector data. Though the space of SPD matrices is well-known to form a Lie group that is a Riemannian manifold, existing work fails to take full advantage of its geometric structure. This paper attempts to tackle this problem by proposing a kernel based method for SR and dictionary learning (DL) of SPD matrices. We disclose that the space of SPD matrices, with the operations of logarithmic multiplication and scalar logarithmic multiplication de?ned in the Log-Euclidean framework, is a complete inner product space. We can thus develop a broad family of kernels that satis?es Mercer’s condition. These kernels characterize the geodesic distance and can be computed ef?ciently. We also consider the geometric structure in the DL process by updating atom matrices in the Riemannian space instead of in the Euclidean space. The proposed method is evaluated with various vision problems and shows notable per- formance gains over state-of-the-arts.</p><p>5 0.71758699 <a title="212-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Novel_Earth_Mover%27s_Distance_Methodology_for_Image_Matching_with_Gaussian_Mixture_Models.html">25 iccv-2013-A Novel Earth Mover's Distance Methodology for Image Matching with Gaussian Mixture Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Peihua Li, Qilong Wang, Lei Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The similarity or distance measure between Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) plays a crucial role in contentbased image matching. Though the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) has shown its advantages in matching histogram features, its potentials in matching GMMs remain unclear and are not fully explored. To address this problem, we propose a novel EMD methodology for GMM matching. We ?rst present a sparse representation based EMD called SR-EMD by exploiting the sparse property of the underlying problem. SR-EMD is more ef?cient and robust than the conventional EMD. Second, we present two novel ground distances between component Gaussians based on the information geometry. The perspective from the Riemannian geometry distinguishes the proposed ground distances from the classical entropy- or divergence-based ones. Furthermore, motivated by the success of distance metric learning of vector data, we make the ?rst attempt to learn the EMD distance metrics between GMMs by using a simple yet effective supervised pair-wise based method. It can adapt the distance metrics between GMMs to speci?c classi?ca- tion tasks. The proposed method is evaluated on both simulated data and benchmark real databases and achieves very promising performance.</p><p>6 0.71213585 <a title="212-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-An_Adaptive_Descriptor_Design_for_Object_Recognition_in_the_Wild.html">48 iccv-2013-An Adaptive Descriptor Design for Object Recognition in the Wild</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel M. Steinberg, Oscar Pizarro, Stefan B. Williams</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of cheap, high fidelity, digital imaging systems, the quantity and rate of generation of visual data can dramatically outpace a humans ability to label or annotate it. In these situations there is scope for the use of unsupervised approaches that can model these datasets and automatically summarise their content. To this end, we present a totally unsupervised, and annotation-less, model for scene understanding. This model can simultaneously cluster whole-image and segment descriptors, therebyforming an unsupervised model of scenes and objects. We show that this model outperforms other unsupervised models that can only cluster one source of information (image or segment) at once. We are able to compare unsupervised and supervised techniques using standard measures derived from confusion matrices and contingency tables. This shows that our unsupervised model is competitive with current supervised and weakly-supervised models for scene understanding on standard datasets. We also demonstrate our model operating on a dataset with more than 100,000 images col- lected by an autonomous underwater vehicle.</p><p>2 0.6983583 <a title="212-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Label_Propagation_for_Semi-supervised_Multi-class_Multi-label_Classification.html">126 iccv-2013-Dynamic Label Propagation for Semi-supervised Multi-class Multi-label Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Wang, Zhuowen Tu, John K. Tsotsos</p><p>Abstract: In graph-based semi-supervised learning approaches, the classification rate is highly dependent on the size of the availabel labeled data, as well as the accuracy of the similarity measures. Here, we propose a semi-supervised multi-class/multi-label classification scheme, dynamic label propagation (DLP), which performs transductive learning through propagation in a dynamic process. Existing semi-supervised classification methods often have difficulty in dealing with multi-class/multi-label problems due to the lack in consideration of label correlation; our algorithm instead emphasizes dynamic metric fusion with label information. Significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods is observed on benchmark datasets for both multiclass and multi-label tasks.</p><p>3 0.6633302 <a title="212-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-New_Graph_Structured_Sparsity_Model_for_Multi-label_Image_Annotations.html">290 iccv-2013-New Graph Structured Sparsity Model for Multi-label Image Annotations</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao Cai, Feiping Nie, Weidong Cai, Heng Huang</p><p>Abstract: In multi-label image annotations, because each image is associated to multiple categories, the semantic terms (label classes) are not mutually exclusive. Previous research showed that such label correlations can largely boost the annotation accuracy. However, all existing methods only directly apply the label correlation matrix to enhance the label inference and assignment without further learning the structural information among classes. In this paper, we model the label correlations using the relational graph, and propose a novel graph structured sparse learning model to incorporate the topological constraints of relation graph in multi-label classifications. As a result, our new method will capture and utilize the hidden class structures in relational graph to improve the annotation results. In proposed objective, a large number of structured sparsity-inducing norms are utilized, thus the optimization becomes difficult. To solve this problem, we derive an efficient optimization algorithm with proved convergence. We perform extensive experiments on six multi-label image annotation benchmark data sets. In all empirical results, our new method shows better annotation results than the state-of-the-art approaches.</p><p>4 0.64762747 <a title="212-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Model_Recommendation_with_Virtual_Probes_for_Egocentric_Hand_Detection.html">267 iccv-2013-Model Recommendation with Virtual Probes for Egocentric Hand Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Cheng Li, Kris M. Kitani</p><p>Abstract: Egocentric cameras can be used to benefit such tasks as analyzing fine motor skills, recognizing gestures and learning about hand-object manipulation. To enable such technology, we believe that the hands must detected on thepixellevel to gain important information about the shape of the hands and fingers. We show that the problem of pixel-wise hand detection can be effectively solved, by posing the problem as a model recommendation task. As such, the goal of a recommendation system is to recommend the n-best hand detectors based on the probe set a small amount of labeled data from the test distribution. This requirement of a probe set is a serious limitation in many applications, such as ego-centric hand detection, where the test distribution may be continually changing. To address this limitation, we propose the use of virtual probes which can be automatically extracted from the test distribution. The key idea is – that many features, such as the color distribution or relative performance between two detectors, can be used as a proxy to the probe set. In our experiments we show that the recommendation paradigm is well-equipped to handle complex changes in the appearance of the hands in firstperson vision. In particular, we show how our system is able to generalize to new scenarios by testing our model across multiple users.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.61772764 <a title="212-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Set_Classification_Using_Holistic_Multiple_Order_Statistics_Features_and_Localized_Multi-kernel_Metric_Learning.html">212 iccv-2013-Image Set Classification Using Holistic Multiple Order Statistics Features and Localized Multi-kernel Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiwen Lu, Gang Wang, Pierre Moulin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for image set classification, where each training and testing example contains a set of image instances of an object captured from varying viewpoints or under varying illuminations. While a number of image set classification methods have been proposed in recent years, most of them model each image set as a single linear subspace or mixture of linear subspaces, which may lose some discriminative information for classification. To address this, we propose exploring multiple order statistics as features of image sets, and develop a localized multikernel metric learning (LMKML) algorithm to effectively combine different order statistics information for classification. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four widely used databases including the Honda/UCSD, CMU Mobo, and Youtube face datasets, and the ETH-80 object dataset.</p><p>6 0.61111695 <a title="212-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Segmentation_and_Pose_Tracking_of_Human_in_Natural_Videos.html">225 iccv-2013-Joint Segmentation and Pose Tracking of Human in Natural Videos</a></p>

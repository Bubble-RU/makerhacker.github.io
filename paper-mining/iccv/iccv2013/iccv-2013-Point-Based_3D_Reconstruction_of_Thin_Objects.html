<p>Author: Frank Steinbrücker, Christian Kerl, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to generate highly detailed, textured 3D models of large environments from RGB-D sequences. Our system runs in real-time on a standard desktop PC with a state-of-the-art graphics card. To reduce the memory consumption, we fuse the acquired depth maps and colors in a multi-scale octree representation of a signed distance function. To estimate the camera poses, we construct a pose graph and use dense image alignment to determine the relative pose between pairs of frames. We add edges between nodes when we detect loop-closures and optimize the pose graph to correct for long-term drift. Our implementation is highly parallelized on graphics hardware to achieve real-time performance. More specifically, we can reconstruct, store, and continuously update a colored 3D model of an entire corridor of nine rooms at high levels of detail in real-time on a single GPU with 2.5GB.</p><p>3 0.21152346 <a title="319-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Normal_Field_Integration_for_3D_Reconstruction_of_Mirroring_Objects.html">281 iccv-2013-Multi-view Normal Field Integration for 3D Reconstruction of Mirroring Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Weinmann, Aljosa Osep, Roland Ruiters, Reinhard Klein</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel, robust multi-view normal field integration technique for reconstructing the full 3D shape of mirroring objects. We employ a turntablebased setup with several cameras and displays. These are used to display illumination patterns which are reflected by the object surface. The pattern information observed in the cameras enables the calculation of individual volumetric normal fields for each combination of camera, display and turntable angle. As the pattern information might be blurred depending on the surface curvature or due to nonperfect mirroring surface characteristics, we locally adapt the decoding to the finest still resolvable pattern resolution. In complex real-world scenarios, the normal fields contain regions without observations due to occlusions and outliers due to interreflections and noise. Therefore, a robust reconstruction using only normal information is challenging. Via a non-parametric clustering of normal hypotheses derived for each point in the scene, we obtain both the most likely local surface normal and a local surface consistency estimate. This information is utilized in an iterative mincut based variational approach to reconstruct the surface geometry.</p><p>4 0.21098244 <a title="319-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Shape_Anchors_for_Data-Driven_Multi-view_Reconstruction.html">387 iccv-2013-Shape Anchors for Data-Driven Multi-view Reconstruction</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Owens, Jianxiong Xiao, Antonio Torralba, William Freeman</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven method for building dense 3D reconstructions using a combination of recognition and multi-view cues. Our approach is based on the idea that there are image patches that are so distinctive that we can accurately estimate their latent 3D shapes solely using recognition. We call these patches shape anchors, and we use them as the basis of a multi-view reconstruction system that transfers dense, complex geometry between scenes. We “anchor” our 3D interpretation from these patches, using them to predict geometry for parts of the scene that are relatively ambiguous. The resulting algorithm produces dense reconstructions from stereo point clouds that are sparse and noisy, and we demonstrate it on a challenging dataset of real-world, indoor scenes.</p><p>5 0.20918369 <a title="319-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-STAR3D%3A_Simultaneous_Tracking_and_Reconstruction_of_3D_Objects_Using_RGB-D_Data.html">366 iccv-2013-STAR3D: Simultaneous Tracking and Reconstruction of 3D Objects Using RGB-D Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Yuheng Ren, Victor Prisacariu, David Murray, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a probabilistic framework for simultaneous tracking and reconstruction of 3D rigid objects using an RGB-D camera. The tracking problem is handled using a bag-of-pixels representation and a back-projection scheme. Surface and background appearance models are learned online, leading to robust tracking in the presence of heavy occlusion and outliers. In both our tracking and reconstruction modules, the 3D object is implicitly embedded using a 3D level-set function. The framework is initialized with a simple shape primitive model (e.g. a sphere or a cube), and the real 3D object shape is tracked and reconstructed online. Unlike existing depth-based 3D reconstruction works, which either rely on calibrated/fixed camera set up or use the observed world map to track the depth camera, our framework can simultaneously track and reconstruct small moving objects. We use both qualitative and quantitative results to demonstrate the superior performance of both tracking and reconstruction of our method.</p><p>6 0.20784032 <a title="319-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Saliency_Detection_in_Large_Point_Sets.html">370 iccv-2013-Saliency Detection in Large Point Sets</a></p>

<p>Author: Jaesik Park, Sudipta N. Sinha, Yasuyuki Matsushita, Yu-Wing Tai, In So Kweon</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for accurate 3D shape reconstruction using uncalibrated multiview photometric stereo. A coarse mesh reconstructed using multiview stereo is first parameterized using a planar mesh parameterization technique. Subsequently, multiview photometric stereo is performed in the 2D parameter domain of the mesh, where all geometric and photometric cues from multiple images can be treated uniformly. Unlike traditional methods, there is no need for merging view-dependent surface normal maps. Our key contribution is a new photometric stereo based mesh refinement technique that can efficiently reconstruct meshes with extremely fine geometric details by directly estimating a displacement texture map in the 2D parameter domain. We demonstrate that intricate surface geometry can be reconstructed using several challenging datasets containing surfaces with specular reflections, multiple albedos and complex topologies.</p><p>3 0.77275884 <a title="319-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Large-Scale_Multi-resolution_Surface_Reconstruction_from_RGB-D_Sequences.html">228 iccv-2013-Large-Scale Multi-resolution Surface Reconstruction from RGB-D Sequences</a></p>

<p>Author: Qian-Yi Zhou, Stephen Miller, Vladlen Koltun</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to reconstruction of detailed scene geometry from range video. Range data produced by commodity handheld cameras suffers from high-frequency errors and low-frequency distortion. Our approach deals with both sources of error by reconstructing locally smooth scene fragments and letting these fragments deform in order to align to each other. We develop a volumetric registration formulation that leverages the smoothness of the deformation to make optimization practical for large scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially increases the fidelity of complex scene geometry reconstructed with commodity handheld cameras.</p><p>5 0.72200209 <a title="319-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Normal_Field_Integration_for_3D_Reconstruction_of_Mirroring_Objects.html">281 iccv-2013-Multi-view Normal Field Integration for 3D Reconstruction of Mirroring Objects</a></p>

We introduce the perimeters on graph using difference operators and define the curvature as the first variation of these perimeters. Our proposed approach of mean curvature unifies both local and non local notions of mean curvature on Euclidean domains.

Existing re-identification studies focus on improving the ranking performance, but rarely look into the critical problem of optimising the time-consuming and error-prone post-rank visual search at the user end. In this study, we present a novel one-shot Post-rank OPtimisation (POP) method, which allows a user to quickly refine their search by either “one-shot” or a couple of sparse negative selections during a re-identification process. We conduct systematic behavioural studies to understand user’s searching behaviour and show that the proposed method allows correct re-identification to converge 2.6 times faster than the conventional exhaustive search. Importantly, through extensive evaluations we demonstrate that the method is capable of achieving significant improvement over the stateof-the-art distance metric learning based ranking models, even with just “one shot” feedback optimisation, by as much as over 30% performance improvement for rank 1reidentification on the VIPeR and i-LIDS datasets.</p><p>4 0.61056525 <a title="319-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Sieving_Regression_Forest_Votes_for_Facial_Feature_Detection_in_the_Wild.html">391 iccv-2013-Sieving Regression Forest Votes for Facial Feature Detection in the Wild</a></p>
<p>Author: Heng Yang, Ioannis Patras</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a method for the localization of multiple facial features on challenging face images. In the regression forests (RF) framework, observations (patches) that are extracted at several image locations cast votes for the localization of several facial features. In order to filter out votes that are not relevant, we pass them through two types of sieves, that are organised in a cascade, and which enforce geometric constraints. The first sieve filters out votes that are not consistent with a hypothesis for the location of the face center. Several sieves of the second type, one associated with each individual facial point, filter out distant votes. We propose a method that adjusts onthe-fly the proximity threshold of each second type sieve by applying a classifier which, based on middle-level features extracted from voting maps for the facial feature in question, makes a sequence of decisions on whether the threshold should be reduced or not. We validate our proposed method on two challenging datasets with images collected from the Internet in which we obtain state of the art results without resorting to explicit facial shape models. We also show the benefits of our method for proximity threshold adjustment especially on ’difficult’ face images.</p><p>5 0.60872185 <a title="319-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Constructing_Adaptive_Complex_Cells_for_Robust_Visual_Tracking.html">89 iccv-2013-Constructing Adaptive Complex Cells for Robust Visual Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Dapeng Chen, Zejian Yuan, Yang Wu, Geng Zhang, Nanning Zheng</p><p>Abstract: Representation is a fundamental problem in object tracking. Conventional methods track the target by describing its local or global appearance. In this paper we present that, besides the two paradigms, the composition of local region histograms can also provide diverse and important object cues. We use cells to extract local appearance, and construct complex cells to integrate the information from cells. With different spatial arrangements of cells, complex cells can explore various contextual information at multiple scales, which is important to improve the tracking performance. We also develop a novel template-matching algorithm for object tracking, where the template is composed of temporal varying cells and has two layers to capture the target and background appearance respectively. An adaptive weight is associated with each complex cell to cope with occlusion as well as appearance variation. A fusion weight is associated with each complex cell type to preserve the global distinctiveness. Our algorithm is evaluated on 25 challenging sequences, and the results not only confirm the contribution of each component in our tracking system, but also outperform other competing trackers.</p><p>6 0.59585679 <a title="319-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Active_Learning_of_an_Action_Detector_from_Untrimmed_Videos.html">41 iccv-2013-Active Learning of an Action Detector from Untrimmed Videos</a></p>

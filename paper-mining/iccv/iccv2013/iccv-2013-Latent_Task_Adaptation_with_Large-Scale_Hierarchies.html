<p>Author: Min Sun, Wan Huang, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: Many methods have been proposed to solve the image classification problem for a large number of categories. Among them, methods based on tree-based representations achieve good trade-off between accuracy and test time efficiency. While focusing on learning a tree-shaped hierarchy and the corresponding set of classifiers, most of them [11, 2, 14] use a greedy prediction algorithm for test time efficiency. We argue that the dramatic decrease in accuracy at high efficiency is caused by the specific design choice of the learning and greedy prediction algorithms. In this work, we propose a classifier which achieves a better trade-off between efficiency and accuracy with a given tree-shaped hierarchy. First, we convert the classification problem as finding the best path in the hierarchy, and a novel branchand-bound-like algorithm is introduced to efficiently search for the best path. Second, we jointly train the classifiers using a novel Structured SVM (SSVM) formulation with additional bound constraints. As a result, our method achieves a significant 4.65%, 5.43%, and 4.07% (relative 24.82%, 41.64%, and 109.79%) improvement in accuracy at high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art greedy “tree-based” methods [14] on Caltech-256 [15], SUN [32] and ImageNet 1K [9] dataset, respectively. Finally, we show that our branch-and-bound-like algorithm naturally ranks the paths in the hierarchy (Fig. 8) so that users can further process them.</p><p>5 0.22767881 <a title="233-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Grids%3A_Fast_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbors_and_Range_Searching_for_Image_Search.html">337 iccv-2013-Random Grids: Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbors and Range Searching for Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Dror Aiger, Efi Kokiopoulou, Ehud Rivlin</p><p>Abstract: We propose two solutions for both nearest neighbors and range search problems. For the nearest neighbors problem, we propose a c-approximate solutionfor the restricted version ofthe decisionproblem with bounded radius which is then reduced to the nearest neighbors by a known reduction. For range searching we propose a scheme that learns the parameters in a learning stage adopting them to the case of a set of points with low intrinsic dimension that are embedded in high dimensional space (common scenario for image point descriptors). We compare our algorithms to the best known methods for these problems, i.e. LSH, ANN and FLANN. We show analytically and experimentally that we can do better for moderate approximation factor. Our algorithms are trivial to parallelize. In the experiments conducted, running on couple of million im- ages, our algorithms show meaningful speed-ups when compared with the above mentioned methods.</p><p>6 0.22004151 <a title="233-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Subspace_Search_via_Grassmannian_Based_Hashing.html">162 iccv-2013-Fast Subspace Search via Grassmannian Based Hashing</a></p>

<p>Author: Shi Qiu, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes modeling the complex web image collections with an automatically generated graph structure called visual semantic complex network (VSCN). The nodes on this complex network are clusters of images with both visual and semantic consistency, called semantic concepts. These nodes are connected based on the visual and semantic correlations. Our VSCN with 33, 240 concepts is generated from a collection of 10 million web images. 1 A great deal of valuable information on the structures of the web image collections can be revealed by exploring the VSCN, such as the small-world behavior, concept community, indegree distribution, hubs, and isolated concepts. It not only helps us better understand the web image collections at a macroscopic level, but also has many important practical applications. This paper presents two application examples: content-based image retrieval and image browsing. Experimental results show that the VSCN leads to significant improvement on both the precision of image retrieval (over 200%) and user experience for image browsing.</p><p>3 0.74038976 <a title="233-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Query-Adaptive_Asymmetrical_Dissimilarities_for_Visual_Object_Retrieval.html">334 iccv-2013-Query-Adaptive Asymmetrical Dissimilarities for Visual Object Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Cai-Zhi Zhu, Hervé Jégou, Shin'Ichi Satoh</p><p>Abstract: Visual object retrieval aims at retrieving, from a collection of images, all those in which a given query object appears. It is inherently asymmetric: the query object is mostly included in the database image, while the converse is not necessarily true. However, existing approaches mostly compare the images with symmetrical measures, without considering the different roles of query and database. This paper first measure the extent of asymmetry on large-scale public datasets reflecting this task. Considering the standard bag-of-words representation, we then propose new asymmetrical dissimilarities accounting for the different inlier ratios associated with query and database images. These asymmetrical measures depend on the query, yet they are compatible with an inverted file structure, without noticeably impacting search efficiency. Our experiments show the benefit of our approach, and show that the visual object retrieval task is better treated asymmetrically, in the spirit of state-of-the-art text retrieval.</p><p>4 0.73926026 <a title="233-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Mining_Multiple_Queries_for_Image_Retrieval%3A_On-the-Fly_Learning_of_an_Object-Specific_Mid-level_Representation.html">266 iccv-2013-Mining Multiple Queries for Image Retrieval: On-the-Fly Learning of an Object-Specific Mid-level Representation</a></p>

Empirical results based on the ImageNet data showed significant performance increase over several baseline algorithms.</p><p>2 0.73067111 <a title="233-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Multiple_Non-rigid_Surface_Detection_and_Registration.html">283 iccv-2013-Multiple Non-rigid Surface Detection and Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Wu, Yoshihisa Ijiri, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Detecting and registering nonrigid surfaces are two important research problems for computer vision. Much work has been done with the assumption that there exists only one instance in the image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that detects and registers multiple nonrigid instances of given objects in a cluttered image. Specifically, after we use low level feature points to obtain the initial matches between templates and the input image, a novel high-order affinity graph is constructed to model the consistency of local topology. A hierarchical clustering approach is then used to locate the nonrigid surfaces. To remove the outliers in the cluster, we propose a deterministic annealing approach based on the Thin Plate Spline (TPS) model. The proposed method achieves high accuracy even when the number of outliers is nineteen times larger than the inliers. As the matches may appear sparsely in each instance, we propose a TPS based match growing approach to propagate the matches. Finally, an approach that fuses feature and appearance information is proposed to register each nonrigid surface. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves promis- ing results in detecting and registering multiple non-rigid surfaces in a cluttered scene.</p><p>3 0.724307 <a title="233-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Illuminant_Chromaticity_from_Image_Sequences.html">207 iccv-2013-Illuminant Chromaticity from Image Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Veronique Prinet, Dani Lischinski, Michael Werman</p><p>Abstract: We estimate illuminant chromaticity from temporal sequences, for scenes illuminated by either one or two dominant illuminants. While there are many methods for illuminant estimation from a single image, few works so far have focused on videos, and even fewer on multiple light sources. Our aim is to leverage information provided by the temporal acquisition, where either the objects or the camera or the light source are/is in motion in order to estimate illuminant color without the need for user interaction or using strong assumptions and heuristics. We introduce a simple physically-based formulation based on the assumption that the incident light chromaticity is constant over a short space-time domain. We show that a deterministic approach is not sufficient for accurate and robust estimation: however, a probabilistic formulation makes it possible to implicitly integrate away hidden factors that have been ignored by the physical model. Experimental results are reported on a dataset of natural video sequences and on the GrayBall benchmark, indicating that we compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.</p><p>4 0.71656454 <a title="233-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Pictorial_Human_Spaces%3A_How_Well_Do_Humans_Perceive_a_3D_Articulated_Pose%3F.html">316 iccv-2013-Pictorial Human Spaces: How Well Do Humans Perceive a 3D Articulated Pose?</a></p>
<p>Author: Elisabeta Marinoiu, Dragos Papava, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Human motion analysis in images and video is a central computer vision problem. Yet, there are no studies that reveal how humans perceive other people in images and how accurate they are. In this paper we aim to unveil some of the processing–as well as the levels of accuracy–involved in the 3D perception of people from images by assessing the human performance. Our contributions are: (1) the construction of an experimental apparatus that relates perception and measurement, in particular the visual and kinematic performance with respect to 3D ground truth when the human subject is presented an image of a person in a given pose; (2) the creation of a dataset containing images, articulated 2D and 3D pose ground truth, as well as synchronized eye movement recordings of human subjects, shown a variety of human body configurations, both easy and difficult, as well as their ‘re-enacted’ 3D poses; (3) quantitative analysis revealing the human performance in 3D pose reenactment tasks, the degree of stability in the visual fixation patterns of human subjects, and the way it correlates with different poses. We also discuss the implications of our find- ings for the construction of visual human sensing systems.</p><p>5 0.70716816 <a title="233-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Feature_Set_Matching_for_Partial_Face_Recognition.html">356 iccv-2013-Robust Feature Set Matching for Partial Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Renliang Weng, Jiwen Lu, Junlin Hu, Gao Yang, Yap-Peng Tan</p><p>Abstract: Over the past two decades, a number of face recognition methods have been proposed in the literature. Most of them use holistic face images to recognize people. However, human faces are easily occluded by other objects in many real-world scenarios and we have to recognize the person of interest from his/her partial faces. In this paper, we propose a new partial face recognition approach by using feature set matching, which is able to align partial face patches to holistic gallery faces automatically and is robust to occlusions and illumination changes. Given each gallery image and probe face patch, we first detect keypoints and extract their local features. Then, we propose a Metric Learned ExtendedRobust PointMatching (MLERPM) method to discriminatively match local feature sets of a pair of gallery and probe samples. Lastly, the similarity of two faces is converted as the distance between two feature sets. Experimental results on three public face databases are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><p>6 0.70038396 <a title="233-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Image_Partitioning_Using_Decision_Trees_with_Structured_Split_Criteria.html">448 iccv-2013-Weakly Supervised Learning of Image Partitioning Using Decision Trees with Structured Split Criteria</a></p>

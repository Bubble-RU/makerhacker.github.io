</p><p>5 Introduction Surface registration is one of the most active research topics in 3D computer vision, due to the wide availability of 3D data acquisition techniques/devices (e. [sent-10, score-0.19]
</p><p>6 It often serves as a necessary step for numerous applications, such as shape recognition/retrieval, deformation transfer, facial expression recognition and change detection [6, 23]. [sent-13, score-0.366]
</p><p>7 Most existing surface registration approaches rely on some assumption on the deformation (e. [sent-15, score-0.749]
</p><p>8 , rigid [2], isometric [5] and conformal [26]), which serves as a prior/regularization model and/or facilitates the search of optimal correspondences. [sent-17, score-0.192]
</p><p>9 Despite their success in various applications, accuracy will deteriorate drastically when the real deformation deviates from the assumed group. [sent-18, score-0.296]
</p><p>10 To overcome such a limitation, we first propose a novel deformation model that is able to represent a much wider range of deformations. [sent-19, score-0.296]
</p><p>11 According to Riemannian geome-  try [8], a surface can be represented in a parametrized domain (local charts) so that the deformation at any point p can be unambiguously (i. [sent-20, score-0.536]
</p><p>12 , independently of parametrization and embedding) characterized by considering a particular class of parametrizations for that surface (called canonical parametrizations). [sent-22, score-0.662]
</p><p>13 Based on this, we introduce Canonical Distortion Coefficients (CDCs), defined as the distortions along p’s two principle directions and computed on the canonical parametrization domain. [sent-23, score-0.3]
</p><p>14 An intuitive explanation of CDCs is that they characterize how an infinitesimal circle is deformed into an infinitesimal ellipse at every point. [sent-24, score-0.192]
</p><p>15 Furthermore, in the discrete setting where a surface is represented as a simplicial complex (e. [sent-25, score-0.278]
</p><p>16 , a planar or tetrahedral mesh), we show that the computation of CDCs at any point on the continuous surface corresponds to the computation of CDCs for its corresponding facet in the discrete setting, derived via the common piecewise linear assumption in finite element methods [3]. [sent-27, score-0.637]
</p><p>17 Accordingly, the canonical parametrization at a particular point, which requires the metric tensor to be Euclidean, simply corresponds to any mapping of the facet from 3D to 2D that preserves edge lengths and orientations. [sent-28, score-0.61]
</p><p>18 It follows that the CDCs for the deformation ofeach facet can be computed in a closed form, 33335603  Figure1. [sent-29, score-0.555]
</p><p>19 Finally, we introduce a higher-order MRF-based approach for dense surface registration, which integrates the above deformation model and geometry/texture similarity in a single formulation and jointly searches for the optimal correspondence for all the points via combinatorial optimization. [sent-35, score-0.566]
</p><p>20 In sum, the contributions of this paper are three-fold, including the generic deformation model (CDCs), the higherorder MRF-based approach for dense surface registration and the parallel MRF inference algorithm. [sent-37, score-0.902]
</p><p>21 On the one hand, our deformation model is generic, leading to the fact that those deformation groups commonly used in surface registration (e. [sent-39, score-1.022]
</p><p>22 Due to this property, our surface registration method is able to effectively handle much more complex deformations such as the anisotropic or locally twisting motions (Fig. [sent-42, score-0.541]
</p><p>23 On the other hand, the higher-order MRF surface registration approach takes advantage of optimality and efficiency properties of graphical models [24], which is further boosted by the developed  parallel inference algorithm. [sent-44, score-0.518]
</p><p>24 Via a series of experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvement in nonrigid 3D surface registration and tracking. [sent-45, score-0.456]
</p><p>25 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the mathematical formulation of the deformation model is introduced in Sec. [sent-46, score-0.318]
</p><p>26 3, we present our higher-order MRF model for surface registration, as well as its parallel optimization; the experimental validation of the proposed techniques in 3D surface registration and tracking is shown in Sec. [sent-48, score-0.759]
</p><p>27 Related work Accurately characterizing the deformations of an arbitrary 3D object is a very challenging task due to the high degrees of freedom exhibited in real-world deformations. [sent-51, score-0.201]
</p><p>28 Among previous approaches, certain “rigidity” assumptions have been widely made, either in extrinsic space or in intrinsic space, as a tradeoff between the accuracy in deformation representation and the simplicity in computation. [sent-52, score-0.375]
</p><p>29 When a shape is represented in extrinsic space, a simple deformation model is the rigid deformation (i. [sent-53, score-0.63]
</p><p>30 Assuming two shapes undergo a (near) rigid deformation between them, the Iterative Closest Points (ICP) method [2] has been widely adopted for surface registration. [sent-56, score-0.536]
</p><p>31 In order to address this, the notion of local rigidity has been proposed, which assumes that the deformation between the local neighborhoods of two corresponding points is rigid  [7, 16, 20, 22], leading to a higher degrees of freedom of the deformation. [sent-60, score-0.396]
</p><p>32 However, such a model does not make use of the geometric properties of surface deformation and searching for the correspondences between two surfaces with large deformations directly in the original extrinsic space would suffer from high computational complexity. [sent-61, score-0.787]
</p><p>33 A more efficient way of handling large deformations is to consider the intrinsic representation, which assumes that each point of a surface is equipped with a metric tensor. [sent-62, score-0.422]
</p><p>34 , isometry) can then be characterized by assuming that the metric tensor remains the same during the deformation of a surface. [sent-65, score-0.392]
</p><p>35 One popular approach to matching two surfaces undergoing isometric deformations is to consider the conformal mappings of the surfaces [26]. [sent-66, score-0.478]
</p><p>36 It benefits from a nice property: for surfaces undergoing only isometric deformations, their conformal parametrizations only differ by a Mobius transformation with very few degrees of freedom [11]. [sent-67, score-0.461]
</p><p>37 Another popular approach is to embed the surface into an Euclidean space such that the Euclidean distance approximates the intrinsic properties of the surface [4, 12, 14, 19]. [sent-72, score-0.521]
</p><p>38 The finite element method assumes the transformation between facets to be piecewise linear and f(a? [sent-106, score-0.173]
</p><p>39 comes to dense and anisometric deformations, the accuracy of the above methods would unavoidably deteriorate due to the isometric assumption. [sent-121, score-0.2]
</p><p>40 Riemannian metric and parametrization Let (M, gM) denote a surface M equipped with a RiemaLnnetia (nM Mm,etgric gM . [sent-134, score-0.425]

</p><p>42 Any local representation satisfying this transformation rule is a valid parametrization of the surface. [sent-147, score-0.19]
</p><p>43 Since the metric tensor at any point p is positive definite, it is always possible to apply a proper linear transformation to its local parametrization φα such that gα (p) is an identity matrix. [sent-148, score-0.251]
</p><p>44 We name this particular type of parametrization canonical parametrization: Definition 1 (Canonical parametrization) For any p ∈ DMef, a parametrization φaαl : a Urαa m→e rRiz2a itsi ocna)lle Fdo rcan aonnyic pal if Mthe ,m ae ptarirca mtenetsorirz aatit p ni sφ the: identity matrix. [sent-149, score-0.433]
</p><p>45 Accordingly, the Jacobian matrix Jpq between the two points p and q under their canonical parametrizations is called the canonical Jacobian. [sent-150, score-0.355]
</p><p>46 In the following, we show that considering the canonical parametrization and Jacobian leads to a representation of arbitrary deformations that are independent from both the intrinsic and extrinsic represen-  tations of the surface. [sent-151, score-0.468]
</p><p>47 Canonical Distortion Coefficients Let us consider arbitrary diffeomorphisms between the parametrization domains of two surfaces. [sent-154, score-0.184]
</p><p>48 In particular, under canonical parametrizations for points p and q (i. [sent-156, score-0.232]
</p><p>49 , both gα (p) and (q) are identity matrices), the matrix JpTqJpq accurately characterizes such local deformation, where Jpq is the canonical Jacobian mapping p to q. [sent-158, score-0.16]
</p><p>50 , how a circle is deformed into an ellipse regardless of its orientation, the distortion along its two principle directions can be represented by the two eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 of JpTqJpq. [sent-162, score-0.161]
</p><p>51 Therefore, the local deformation between two surfaces can be characterized by the two eigenvalues for each pair (p, q) of corresponding points. [sent-163, score-0.433]
</p><p>52 Formally, we define:  gβ  Definition 2 (Canonical Distortion Coefficients) Canonical Distortion Coefficients (CDCs) between points p and q are defined as the eigenvalues of the matrix JpTqJpq where Jpq is the Jacobian matrix between any canonical parametrization at p and q. [sent-164, score-0.307]
</p><p>53 CDCs are able to characterize a wide class of deformation groups. [sent-165, score-0.322]
</p><p>54 In the case of the isometric deformation, a unit circle is mapped to a unit circle, i. [sent-167, score-0.166]
</p><p>55 In the case of the conformal deformation, a unit circle can be mapped to a circle with arbitrary radius [21], i. [sent-171, score-0.173]
</p><p>56 However, BCs are for conformal surface parametrization, where the scaling factor is lost. [sent-175, score-0.315]
</p><p>57 The proposed CDCs preserve the scale information which is important for surface registration. [sent-176, score-0.24]
</p><p>58 Note that the ability of CDCs to encode scale information directly makes CDCs suitable to characterize detailed, anisometric deformation for dense surface registration. [sent-178, score-0.645]
</p><p>59 Finite element discretization The basic assumption in finite element analysis [3] is that continuous space can be approximated using a set of basis 33335625  elements (e. [sent-181, score-0.154]
</p><p>60 Here, we consider the most common discrete surface representation – the triangular mesh, with triangular facets as basis finite elements. [sent-184, score-0.611]
</p><p>61 Thus, the  ×  canonical parametrization for a facet is Euclidean ifits mapping to the 2D domain preserves all the edge lengths. [sent-186, score-0.549]

</p><p>78 The algorithm by [3 1] does not guarantee the quality of each triangular facet in the target matching (b). [sent-443, score-0.375]

</p><p>83 Furthermore, we have compared our approach with a recent intrinsic space based method [10] for dense surface registration. [sent-465, score-0.311]
</p><p>84 Note that [10] assumes the mapping between two surfaces be bijective and there is no explicit underlying deformation model in selecting the final correspondence. [sent-469, score-0.406]
</p><p>85 In contrast, our deformation model was explicitly encoded in the MRF model for selecting the op-  timal dense correspondence, which is a main reason for the better performance. [sent-470, score-0.326]
</p><p>86 The quality of matching is measured by the ratio of area change of each triangular facet, under the assumption that most large area changes are caused by wrong matches. [sent-473, score-0.21]
</p><p>87 The 3D scan of a highly deformable toy is captured by the system introduced in [27] before and after a large deformation (Fig. [sent-488, score-0.296]

</p><p>91 Template-based surface tracking Finally, we apply our method to the challenging problem of template-base surface tracking. [sent-513, score-0.507]

</p><p>94 Also we handle drift error by imposing consistency between the first frame and the current frame, using the same deformation prior obtained in Fig. [sent-529, score-0.296]
</p><p>95 The tracking results demonstrate that our method is able to track the subtle expression change correctly, even in the challenging case where the deformation is highly anisometric. [sent-535, score-0.365]

<p>Author: Wei Zeng, Mayank Goswami, Feng Luo, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Surface registration plays a fundamental role in many applications in computer vision and aims at finding a oneto-one correspondence between surfaces. Conformal mapping based surface registration methods conformally map 2D/3D surfaces onto 2D canonical domains and perform the matching on the 2D plane. This registration framework reduces dimensionality, and the result is intrinsic to Riemannian metric and invariant under isometric deformation. However, conformal mapping will be affected by inconsistent boundaries and non-isometric deformations of surfaces. In this work, we quantify the effects of boundary variation and non-isometric deformation to conformal mappings, and give the theoretical upper bounds for the distortions of conformal mappings under these two factors.

<p>Author: Yuandong Tian, Srinivasa G. Narasimhan</p><p>Abstract: Real-world surfaces such as clothing, water and human body deform in complex ways. The image distortions observed are high-dimensional and non-linear, making it hard to estimate these deformations accurately. The recent datadriven descent approach [17] applies Nearest Neighbor estimators iteratively on a particular distribution of training samples to obtain a globally optimal and dense deformation field between a template and a distorted image. In this work, we develop a hierarchical structure for the Nearest Neighbor estimators, each of which can have only a local image support. We demonstrate in both theory and practice that this algorithm has several advantages over the nonhierarchical version: it guarantees global optimality with significantly fewer training samples, is several orders faster, provides a metric to decide whether a given image is “hard” (or “easy ”) requiring more (or less) samples, and can handle more complex scenes that include both global motion and local deformation. The proposed algorithm successfully tracks a broad range of non-rigid scenes including water, clothing, and medical images, and compares favorably against several other deformation estimation and tracking approaches that do not provide optimality guarantees.</p><p>4 0.16394962 <a title="16-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Accurate_and_Robust_3D_Facial_Capture_Using_a_Single_RGBD_Camera.html">36 iccv-2013-Accurate and Robust 3D Facial Capture Using a Single RGBD Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Yen-Lin Chen, Hsiang-Tao Wu, Fuhao Shi, Xin Tong, Jinxiang Chai</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an automatic and robust approach that accurately captures high-quality 3D facial performances using a single RGBD camera. The key of our approach is to combine the power of automatic facial feature detection and image-based 3D nonrigid registration techniques for 3D facial reconstruction. In particular, we develop a robust and accurate image-based nonrigid registration algorithm that incrementally deforms a 3D template mesh model to best match observed depth image data and important facial features detected from single RGBD images. The whole process is fully automatic and robust because it is based on single frame facial registration framework. The system is flexible because it does not require any strong 3D facial priors such as blendshape models. We demonstrate the power of our approach by capturing a wide range of 3D facial expressions using a single RGBD camera and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy by comparing against alternative methods.</p><p>5 0.15680164 <a title="16-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Multiple_Non-rigid_Surface_Detection_and_Registration.html">283 iccv-2013-Multiple Non-rigid Surface Detection and Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Wu, Yoshihisa Ijiri, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Detecting and registering nonrigid surfaces are two important research problems for computer vision. Much work has been done with the assumption that there exists only one instance in the image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that detects and registers multiple nonrigid instances of given objects in a cluttered image. Specifically, after we use low level feature points to obtain the initial matches between templates and the input image, a novel high-order affinity graph is constructed to model the consistency of local topology. A hierarchical clustering approach is then used to locate the nonrigid surfaces. To remove the outliers in the cluster, we propose a deterministic annealing approach based on the Thin Plate Spline (TPS) model. The proposed method achieves high accuracy even when the number of outliers is nineteen times larger than the inliers. As the matches may appear sparsely in each instance, we propose a TPS based match growing approach to propagate the matches. Finally, an approach that fuses feature and appearance information is proposed to register each nonrigid surface. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves promis- ing results in detecting and registering multiple non-rigid surfaces in a cluttered scene.</p><p>6 0.13763596 <a title="16-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven_Efficiently-Sampled_Sparse_Graphical_Models_for_Concurrent_Tumor_Segmentation_and_Atlas_Registration.html">432 iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven Efficiently-Sampled Sparse Graphical Models for Concurrent Tumor Segmentation and Atlas Registration</a></p>

<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Xianfeng Gu, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dense non-rigid 3D surface registration, which brings together Riemannian geometry and graphical models. To this end, we first introduce a generic deformation model, called Canonical Distortion Coefficients (CDCs), by characterizing the deformation of every point on a surface using the distortions along its two principle directions. This model subsumes the deformation groups commonly used in surface registration such as isometry and conformality, and is able to handle more complex deformations. We also derive its discrete counterpart which can be computed very efficiently in a closed form. Based on these, we introduce a higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) model which seamlessly integrates our deformation model and a geometry/texture similarity metric. Then we jointly establish the optimal correspondences for all the points via maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Moreover, we develop a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently perform the inference for the proposed higher-order MRF model.

<p>Author: Wei Zeng, Mayank Goswami, Feng Luo, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Surface registration plays a fundamental role in many applications in computer vision and aims at finding a oneto-one correspondence between surfaces. Conformal mapping based surface registration methods conformally map 2D/3D surfaces onto 2D canonical domains and perform the matching on the 2D plane. This registration framework reduces dimensionality, and the result is intrinsic to Riemannian metric and invariant under isometric deformation. However, conformal mapping will be affected by inconsistent boundaries and non-isometric deformations of surfaces. In this work, we quantify the effects of boundary variation and non-isometric deformation to conformal mappings, and give the theoretical upper bounds for the distortions of conformal mappings under these two factors. Besides giving the thorough theoretical proofs of the theorems, we verified them by concrete experiments using 3D human facial scans with dynamic expressions and varying boundaries. Furthermore, we used the distortion estimates for reducing search range in feature matching of surface registration applications.

Range data produced by commodity handheld cameras suffers from high-frequency errors and low-frequency distortion. Our approach deals with both sources of error by reconstructing locally smooth scene fragments and letting these fragments deform in order to align to each other. We develop a volumetric registration formulation that leverages the smoothness of the deformation to make optimization practical for large scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially increases the fidelity of complex scene geometry reconstructed with commodity handheld cameras.</p><p>6 0.6149745 <a title="16-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Go-ICP%3A_Solving_3D_Registration_Efficiently_and_Globally_Optimally.html">185 iccv-2013-Go-ICP: Solving 3D Registration Efficiently and Globally Optimally</a></p>

<p>Author: Peihua Li, Qilong Wang, Lei Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The similarity or distance measure between Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) plays a crucial role in contentbased image matching. Though the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) has shown its advantages in matching histogram features, its potentials in matching GMMs remain unclear and are not fully explored. To address this problem, we propose a novel EMD methodology for GMM matching. We ?rst present a sparse representation based EMD called SR-EMD by exploiting the sparse property of the underlying problem. SR-EMD is more ef?cient and robust than the conventional EMD. Second, we present two novel ground distances between component Gaussians based on the information geometry. The perspective from the Riemannian geometry distinguishes the proposed ground distances from the classical entropy- or divergence-based ones. Furthermore, motivated by the success of distance metric learning of vector data, we make the ?rst attempt to learn the EMD distance metrics between GMMs by using a simple yet effective supervised pair-wise based method. It can adapt the distance metrics between GMMs to speci?c classi?ca- tion tasks. The proposed method is evaluated on both simulated data and benchmark real databases and achieves very promising performance.</p><p>2 0.80210865 <a title="16-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Graph_Matching%3A_Oriented_to_Category_Modeling_from_Cluttered_Scenes.html">237 iccv-2013-Learning Graph Matching: Oriented to Category Modeling from Cluttered Scenes</a></p>

In this way, the model learning is oriented toward both matching and recognition performance, and can proceed in an unsupervised1 fashion.

<p>Author: Saad Ali</p><p>Abstract: In this paper a notion of flow complexity that measures the amount of interaction among objects is introduced and an approach to compute it directly from a video sequence is proposed. The approach employs particle trajectories as the input representation of motion and maps it into a ‘braid’ based representation. The mapping is based on the observation that 2D trajectories of particles take the form of a braid in space-time due to the intermingling among particles over time. As a result of this mapping, the problem of estimating the flow complexity from particle trajectories becomes the problem of estimating braid complexity, which in turn can be computed by measuring the topological entropy of a braid. For this purpose recently developed mathematical tools from braid theory are employed which allow rapid computation of topological entropy of braids. The approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of open source videos depicting variations in terms of types of moving objects, scene layout, camera view angle, motion patterns, and object densities. The results show that the proposed approach is able to quantify the complexity of the flow, and at the same time provides useful insights about the sources of the complexity.</p><p>6 0.75269139 <a title="16-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-GOSUS%3A_Grassmannian_Online_Subspace_Updates_with_Structured-Sparsity.html">182 iccv-2013-GOSUS: Grassmannian Online Subspace Updates with Structured-Sparsity</a></p>

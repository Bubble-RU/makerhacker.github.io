<p>Author: Peihua Li, Qilong Wang, Wangmeng Zuo, Lei Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The symmetric positive de?nite (SPD) matrices have been widely used in image and vision problems. Recently there are growing interests in studying sparse representation (SR) of SPD matrices, motivated by the great success of SR for vector data. Though the space of SPD matrices is well-known to form a Lie group that is a Riemannian manifold, existing work fails to take full advantage of its geometric structure. This paper attempts to tackle this problem by proposing a kernel based method for SR and dictionary learning (DL) of SPD matrices. We disclose that the space of SPD matrices, with the operations of logarithmic multiplication and scalar logarithmic multiplication de?ned in the Log-Euclidean framework, is a complete inner product space. We can thus develop a broad family of kernels that satis?es Mercer’s condition. These kernels characterize the geodesic distance and can be computed ef?ciently. We also consider the geometric structure in the DL process by updating atom matrices in the Riemannian space instead of in the Euclidean space. The proposed method is evaluated with various vision problems and shows notable per- formance gains over state-of-the-arts.</p><p>3 0.11566161 <a title="25-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Saliency_and_Human_Fixations%3A_State-of-the-Art_and_Study_of_Comparison_Metrics.html">373 iccv-2013-Saliency and Human Fixations: State-of-the-Art and Study of Comparison Metrics</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolas Riche, Matthieu Duvinage, Matei Mancas, Bernard Gosselin, Thierry Dutoit</p><p>Abstract: Visual saliency has been an increasingly active research area in the last ten years with dozens of saliency models recently published. Nowadays, one of the big challenges in the field is to find a way to fairly evaluate all of these models. In this paper, on human eye fixations ,we compare the ranking of 12 state-of-the art saliency models using 12 similarity metrics. The comparison is done on Jian Li ’s database containing several hundreds of natural images. Based on Kendall concordance coefficient, it is shown that some of the metrics are strongly correlated leading to a redundancy in the performance metrics reported in the available benchmarks. On the other hand, other metrics provide a more diverse picture of models ’ overall performance. As a recommendation, three similarity metrics should be used to obtain a complete point of view of saliency model performance.</p><p>4 0.085720733 <a title="25-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_Salient_Region_Detection_with_Soft_Image_Abstraction.html">137 iccv-2013-Efficient Salient Region Detection with Soft Image Abstraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming-Ming Cheng, Jonathan Warrell, Wen-Yan Lin, Shuai Zheng, Vibhav Vineet, Nigel Crook</p><p>Abstract: Detecting visually salient regions in images is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision. We propose a novel method to decompose an image into large scale perceptually homogeneous elements for efficient salient region detection, using a soft image abstraction representation. By considering both appearance similarity and spatial distribution of image pixels, the proposed representation abstracts out unnecessary image details, allowing the assignment of comparable saliency values across similar regions, and producing perceptually accurate salient region detection. We evaluate our salient region detection approach on the largest publicly available dataset with pixel accurate annotations. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms 18 alternate methods, reducing the mean absolute error by 25.2% compared to the previous best result, while being computationally more efficient.</p><p>5 0.069192894 <a title="25-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Deep_Learning_for_Pedestrian_Detection.html">220 iccv-2013-Joint Deep Learning for Pedestrian Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Feature extraction, deformation handling, occlusion handling, and classi?cation are four important components in pedestrian detection. Existing methods learn or design these components either individually or sequentially. The interaction among these components is not yet well explored. This paper proposes that they should be jointly learned in order to maximize their strengths through cooperation. We formulate these four components into a joint deep learning framework and propose a new deep network architecture1. By establishing automatic, mutual interaction among components, the deep model achieves a 9% reduction in the average miss rate compared with the current best-performing pedestrian detection approaches on the largest Caltech benchmark dataset.</p><p>6 0.065269694 <a title="25-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Feature_Set_Matching_for_Partial_Face_Recognition.html">356 iccv-2013-Robust Feature Set Matching for Partial Face Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Hesamoddin Salehian, Guang Cheng, Baba C. Vemuri, Jeffrey Ho</p><p>Abstract: Symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices are ubiquitous in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Medical Image Analysis. Finding the center/average of a population of such matrices is a common theme in many algorithms such as clustering, segmentation, principal geodesic analysis, etc. The center of a population of such matrices can be defined using a variety of distance/divergence measures as the minimizer of the sum of squared distances/divergences from the unknown center to the members of the population. It is well known that the computation of the Karcher mean for the space of SPD matrices which is a negativelycurved Riemannian manifold is computationally expensive. Recently, the LogDet divergence-based center was shown to be a computationally attractive alternative. However, the LogDet-based mean of more than two matrices can not be computed in closed form, which makes it computationally less attractive for large populations. In this paper we present a novel recursive estimator for center based on the Stein distance which is the square root of the LogDet di– vergence that is significantly faster than the batch mode computation of this center. The key theoretical contribution is a closed-form solution for the weighted Stein center of two SPD matrices, which is used in the recursive computation of the Stein center for a population of SPD matrices. Additionally, we show experimental evidence of the convergence of our recursive Stein center estimator to the batch mode Stein center. We present applications of our recursive estimator to K-means clustering and image indexing depicting significant time gains over corresponding algorithms that use the batch mode computations. For the latter application, we develop novel hashing functions using the Stein distance and apply it to publicly available data sets, and experimental results have shown favorable com– ∗This research was funded in part by the NIH grant NS066340 to BCV. †Corresponding author parisons to other competing methods.</p><p>3 0.74612379 <a title="25-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Log-Euclidean_Kernels_for_Sparse_Representation_and_Dictionary_Learning.html">257 iccv-2013-Log-Euclidean Kernels for Sparse Representation and Dictionary Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Pengfei Zhu, Lei Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Most of the current metric learning methods are proposed for point-to-point distance (PPD) based classification. In many computer vision tasks, however, we need to measure the point-to-set distance (PSD) and even set-to-set distance (SSD) for classification. In this paper, we extend the PPD based Mahalanobis distance metric learning to PSD and SSD based ones, namely point-to-set distance metric learning (PSDML) and set-to-set distance metric learning (SSDML), and solve them under a unified optimization framework. First, we generate positive and negative sample pairs by computing the PSD and SSD between training samples. Then, we characterize each sample pair by its covariance matrix, and propose a covariance kernel based discriminative function. Finally, we tackle the PSDML and SSDMLproblems by using standard support vector machine solvers, making the metric learning very efficient for multiclass visual classification tasks. Experiments on gender classification, digit recognition, object categorization and face recognition show that the proposed metric learning methods can effectively enhance the performance of PSD and SSD based classification.</p><p>5 0.65435487 <a title="25-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Set_Classification_Using_Holistic_Multiple_Order_Statistics_Features_and_Localized_Multi-kernel_Metric_Learning.html">212 iccv-2013-Image Set Classification Using Holistic Multiple Order Statistics Features and Localized Multi-kernel Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiwen Lu, Gang Wang, Pierre Moulin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for image set classification, where each training and testing example contains a set of image instances of an object captured from varying viewpoints or under varying illuminations. While a number of image set classification methods have been proposed in recent years, most of them model each image set as a single linear subspace or mixture of linear subspaces, which may lose some discriminative information for classification. To address this, we propose exploring multiple order statistics as features of image sets, and develop a localized multikernel metric learning (LMKML) algorithm to effectively combine different order statistics information for classification. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four widely used databases including the Honda/UCSD, CMU Mobo, and Youtube face datasets, and the ETH-80 object dataset.</p><p>6 0.6085692 <a title="25-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Large-Scale_Image_Annotation_by_Efficient_and_Robust_Kernel_Metric_Learning.html">227 iccv-2013-Large-Scale Image Annotation by Efficient and Robust Kernel Metric Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Chi Xu, Li Cheng</p><p>Abstract: We tackle the practical problem of hand pose estimation from a single noisy depth image. A dedicated three-step pipeline is proposed: Initial estimation step provides an initial estimation of the hand in-plane orientation and 3D location; Candidate generation step produces a set of 3D pose candidate from the Hough voting space with the help of the rotational invariant depth features; Verification step delivers the final 3D hand pose as the solution to an optimization problem. We analyze the depth noises, and suggest tips to minimize their negative impacts on the overall performance. Our approach is able to work with Kinecttype noisy depth images, and reliably produces pose estimations of general motions efficiently (12 frames per second). Extensive experiments are conducted to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the performance with respect to the state-of-the-art methods that have access to additional RGB images. Our approach is shown to deliver on par or even better results.</p><p>2 0.94701219 <a title="25-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Unifying_Nuclear_Norm_and_Bilinear_Factorization_Approaches_for_Low-Rank_Matrix_Decomposition.html">434 iccv-2013-Unifying Nuclear Norm and Bilinear Factorization Approaches for Low-Rank Matrix Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ricardo Cabral, Fernando De_La_Torre, João P. Costeira, Alexandre Bernardino</p><p>Abstract: Low rank models have been widely usedfor the representation of shape, appearance or motion in computer vision problems. Traditional approaches to fit low rank models make use of an explicit bilinear factorization. These approaches benefit from fast numerical methods for optimization and easy kernelization. However, they suffer from serious local minima problems depending on the loss function and the amount/type of missing data. Recently, these lowrank models have alternatively been formulated as convex problems using the nuclear norm regularizer; unlike factorization methods, their numerical solvers are slow and it is unclear how to kernelize them or to impose a rank a priori. This paper proposes a unified approach to bilinear factorization and nuclear norm regularization, that inherits the benefits of both. We analyze the conditions under which these approaches are equivalent. Moreover, based on this analysis, we propose a new optimization algorithm and a “rank continuation ” strategy that outperform state-of-theart approaches for Robust PCA, Structure from Motion and Photometric Stereo with outliers and missing data.</p><p>3 0.92858428 <a title="25-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Object_Segmentation_in_Unconstrained_Video.html">160 iccv-2013-Fast Object Segmentation in Unconstrained Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Anestis Papazoglou, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: We present a technique for separating foreground objects from the background in a video. Our method isfast, , fully automatic, and makes minimal assumptions about the video. This enables handling essentially unconstrained settings, including rapidly moving background, arbitrary object motion and appearance, and non-rigid deformations and articulations. In experiments on two datasets containing over 1400 video shots, our method outperforms a state-of-theart background subtraction technique [4] as well as methods based on clustering point tracks [6, 18, 19]. Moreover, it performs comparably to recent video object segmentation methods based on objectproposals [14, 16, 27], while being orders of magnitude faster.</p><p>4 0.91131032 <a title="25-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Dictionary_Learning_by_Error_Source_Decomposition.html">354 iccv-2013-Robust Dictionary Learning by Error Source Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhuoyuan Chen, Ying Wu</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity models have recently shown great promise in many vision tasks. Using a learned dictionary in sparsity models can in general outperform predefined bases in clean data. In practice, both training and testing data may be corrupted and contain noises and outliers. Although recent studies attempted to cope with corrupted data and achieved encouraging results in testing phase, how to handle corruption in training phase still remains a very difficult problem. In contrast to most existing methods that learn the dictionaryfrom clean data, this paper is targeted at handling corruptions and outliers in training data for dictionary learning. We propose a general method to decompose the reconstructive residual into two components: a non-sparse component for small universal noises and a sparse component for large outliers, respectively. In addition, , further analysis reveals the connection between our approach and the “partial” dictionary learning approach, updating only part of the prototypes (or informative codewords) with remaining (or noisy codewords) fixed. Experiments on synthetic data as well as real applications have shown satisfactory per- formance of this new robust dictionary learning approach.</p><p>5 0.90661263 <a title="25-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Interactive_Markerless_Articulated_Hand_Motion_Tracking_Using_RGB_and_Depth_Data.html">218 iccv-2013-Interactive Markerless Articulated Hand Motion Tracking Using RGB and Depth Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Srinath Sridhar, Antti Oulasvirta, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: Tracking the articulated 3D motion of the hand has important applications, for example, in human–computer interaction and teleoperation. We present a novel method that can capture a broad range of articulated hand motions at interactive rates. Our hybrid approach combines, in a voting scheme, a discriminative, part-based pose retrieval method with a generative pose estimation method based on local optimization. Color information from a multiview RGB camera setup along with a person-specific hand model are used by the generative method to find the pose that best explains the observed images. In parallel, our discriminative pose estimation method uses fingertips detected on depth data to estimate a complete or partial pose of the hand by adopting a part-based pose retrieval strategy. This part-based strategy helps reduce the search space drastically in comparison to a global pose retrieval strategy. Quantitative results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging sequences and a near-realtime performance of 10 fps on a desktop computer.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.89994228 <a title="25-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_Novel_Earth_Mover%27s_Distance_Methodology_for_Image_Matching_with_Gaussian_Mixture_Models.html">25 iccv-2013-A Novel Earth Mover's Distance Methodology for Image Matching with Gaussian Mixture Models</a></p>

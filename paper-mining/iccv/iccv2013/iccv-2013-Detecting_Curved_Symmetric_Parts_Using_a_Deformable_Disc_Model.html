<p>Author: Michael Van_Den_Bergh, Gemma Roig, Xavier Boix, Santiago Manen, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Superpixel and objectness algorithms are broadly used as a pre-processing step to generate support regions and to speed-up further computations. Recently, many algorithms have been extended to video in order to exploit the temporal consistency between frames. However, most methods are computationally too expensive for real-time applications. We introduce an online, real-time video superpixel algorithm based on the recently proposed SEEDS superpixels. A new capability is incorporated which delivers multiple diverse samples (hypotheses) of superpixels in the same image or video sequence. The multiple samples are shown to provide a strong cue to efficiently measure the objectness of image windows, and we introduce the novel concept of objectness in temporal windows. Experiments show that the video superpixels achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art offline methods while running at 30 fps on a single 2.8 GHz i7 CPU. State-of-the-art performance on objectness is also demonstrated, yet orders of magnitude faster and extended to temporal windows in video.</p><p>3 0.2187686 <a title="110-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-SYM-FISH%3A_A_Symmetry-Aware_Flip_Invariant_Sketch_Histogram_Shape_Descriptor.html">368 iccv-2013-SYM-FISH: A Symmetry-Aware Flip Invariant Sketch Histogram Shape Descriptor</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaochun Cao, Hua Zhang, Si Liu, Xiaojie Guo, Liang Lin</p><p>Abstract: Recently, studies on sketch, such as sketch retrieval and sketch classification, have received more attention in the computer vision community. One of its most fundamental and essential problems is how to more effectively describe a sketch image. Many existing descriptors, such as shape context, have achieved great success. In this paper, we propose a new descriptor, namely Symmetric-aware Flip Invariant Sketch Histogram (SYM-FISH) to refine the shape context feature. Its extraction process includes three steps. First the Flip Invariant Sketch Histogram (FISH) descriptor is extracted on the input image, which is a flip-invariant version of the shape context feature. Then we explore the symmetry character of the image by calculating the kurtosis coefficient. Finally, the SYM-FISH is generated by constructing a symmetry table. The new SYM-FISH descriptor supplements the original shape context by encoding the symmetric information, which is a pervasive characteristic of natural scene and objects. We evaluate the efficacy of the novel descriptor in two applications, i.e., sketch retrieval and sketch classification. Extensive experiments on three datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed SYM-FISH descriptor.</p><p>4 0.19247708 <a title="110-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Object_Segmentation_in_Space_and_Time.html">282 iccv-2013-Multi-view Object Segmentation in Space and Time</a></p>
<p>Author: Abdelaziz Djelouah, Jean-Sébastien Franco, Edmond Boyer, François Le_Clerc, Patrick Pérez</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of object segmentation in multiple views or videos when two or more viewpoints of the same scene are available. We propose a new approach that propagates segmentation coherence information in both space and time, hence allowing evidences in one image to be shared over the complete set. To this aim the segmentation is cast as a single efficient labeling problem over space and time with graph cuts. In contrast to most existing multi-view segmentation methods that rely on some form of dense reconstruction, ours only requires a sparse 3D sampling to propagate information between viewpoints. The approach is thoroughly evaluated on standard multiview datasets, as well as on videos. With static views, results compete with state of the art methods but they are achieved with significantly fewer viewpoints. With multiple videos, we report results that demonstrate the benefit of segmentation propagation through temporal cues.</p><p>5 0.18416265 <a title="110-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Temporally_Consistent_Superpixels.html">414 iccv-2013-Temporally Consistent Superpixels</a></p>

In this regards, this paper presents a highly competitive approach for temporally consistent superpixelsfor video content. The approach is based on energy-minimizing clustering utilizing a novel hybrid clustering strategy for a multi-dimensional feature space working in a global color subspace and local spatial subspaces. Moreover, a new contour evolution based strategy is introduced to ensure spatial coherency of the generated superpixels.

<p>Author: Adrien Bartoli, Daniel Pizarro, Toby Collins</p><p>Abstract: We study the uncalibrated isometric Shape-fromTemplate problem, that consists in estimating an isometric deformation from a template shape to an input image whose focal length is unknown. Our method is the first that combines the following features: solving for both the 3D deformation and the camera ’s focal length, involving only local analytical solutions (there is no numerical optimization), being robust to mismatches, handling general surfaces and running extremely fast. This was achieved through two key steps. First, an ‘uncalibrated’ 3D deformation is computed thanks to a novel piecewise weak-perspective projection model. Second, the camera’s focal length is estimated and enables upgrading the 3D deformation to metric. We use a variational framework, implemented using a smooth function basis and sampled local deformation models. The only degeneracy which we easily detect– for focal length estimation is a flat and fronto-parallel surface. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets show that our method achieves a 3D shape accuracy – slightly below state of the art methods using a precalibrated or the true focal length, and a focal length accuracy slightly below static calibration methods.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.68386722 <a title="110-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Detecting_Curved_Symmetric_Parts_Using_a_Deformable_Disc_Model.html">110 iccv-2013-Detecting Curved Symmetric Parts Using a Deformable Disc Model</a></p>

However, we learn affinities between adjacent superpixels in a space that’s invariant to bending and tapering along the symmetry axis, enabling us to capture a wider class of symmetric parts. Moreover, we introduce a global cost that perceptually integrates the hypothesis space by combining a pairwise and a higher-level smoothing term, which we minimize globally using dynamic programming. The new framework is demonstrated on two datasets, and is shown to significantly outperform the baseline [13].</p><p>3 0.6504932 <a title="110-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_the_Visual_Interpretation_of_Sentences.html">246 iccv-2013-Learning the Visual Interpretation of Sentences</a></p>
<p>Author: C. Lawrence Zitnick, Devi Parikh, Lucy Vanderwende</p><p>Abstract: Sentences that describe visual scenes contain a wide variety of information pertaining to the presence of objects, their attributes and their spatial relations. In this paper we learn the visual features that correspond to semantic phrases derived from sentences. Specifically, we extract predicate tuples that contain two nouns and a relation. The relation may take several forms, such as a verb, preposition, adjective or their combination. We model a scene using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) formulation where each node corresponds to an object, and the edges to their relations. We determine the potentials of the CRF using the tuples extracted from the sentences. We generate novel scenes depicting the sentences’ visual meaning by sampling from the CRF. The CRF is also used to score a set of scenes for a text-based image retrieval task. Our results show we can generate (retrieve) scenes that convey the desired semantic meaning, even when scenes (queries) are described by multiple sentences. Significant improvement is found over several baseline approaches.</p><p>4 0.61989772 <a title="110-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Markov_Network-Based_Unified_Classifier_for_Face_Identification.html">261 iccv-2013-Markov Network-Based Unified Classifier for Face Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Wonjun Hwang, Kyungshik Roh, Junmo Kim</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel unifying framework using a Markov network to learn the relationship between multiple classifiers in face recognition. We assume that we have several complementary classifiers and assign observation nodes to the features of a query image and hidden nodes to the features of gallery images. We connect each hidden node to its corresponding observation node and to the hidden nodes of other neighboring classifiers. For each observation-hidden node pair, we collect a set of gallery candidates that are most similar to the observation instance, and the relationship between the hidden nodes is captured in terms of the similarity matrix between the collected gallery images. Posterior probabilities in the hidden nodes are computed by the belief-propagation algorithm. The novelty of the proposed framework is the method that takes into account the classifier dependency using the results of each neighboring classifier. We present extensive results on two different evaluation protocols, known and unknown image variation tests, using three different databases, which shows that the proposed framework always leads to good accuracy in face recognition.</p><p>5 0.61567944 <a title="110-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Large-Scale_Multi-resolution_Surface_Reconstruction_from_RGB-D_Sequences.html">228 iccv-2013-Large-Scale Multi-resolution Surface Reconstruction from RGB-D Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Steinbrücker, Christian Kerl, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to generate highly detailed, textured 3D models of large environments from RGB-D sequences. Our system runs in real-time on a standard desktop PC with a state-of-the-art graphics card. To reduce the memory consumption, we fuse the acquired depth maps and colors in a multi-scale octree representation of a signed distance function. To estimate the camera poses, we construct a pose graph and use dense image alignment to determine the relative pose between pairs of frames. We add edges between nodes when we detect loop-closures and optimize the pose graph to correct for long-term drift. Our implementation is highly parallelized on graphics hardware to achieve real-time performance. More specifically, we can reconstruct, store, and continuously update a colored 3D model of an entire corridor of nine rooms at high levels of detail in real-time on a single GPU with 2.5GB.</p><p>6 0.61454737 <a title="110-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Handling_Uncertain_Tags_in_Visual_Recognition.html">191 iccv-2013-Handling Uncertain Tags in Visual Recognition</a></p>

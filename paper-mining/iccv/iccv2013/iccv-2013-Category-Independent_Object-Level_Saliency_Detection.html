<p>Author: Xiaohui Li, Huchuan Lu, Lihe Zhang, Xiang Ruan, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a visual saliency detection algorithm from the perspective of reconstruction errors. The image boundaries are first extracted via superpixels as likely cues for background templates, from which dense and sparse appearance models are constructed. For each image region, we first compute dense and sparse reconstruction errors. Second, the reconstruction errors are propagated based on the contexts obtained from K-means clustering. Third, pixel-level saliency is computed by an integration of multi-scale reconstruction errors and refined by an object-biased Gaussian model. We apply the Bayes formula to integrate saliency measures based on dense and sparse reconstruction errors. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against seventeen state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall. In addition, the proposed algorithm is demonstrated to be more effective in highlighting salient objects uniformly and robust to background noise.</p><p>3 0.67250788 <a title="71-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Salient_Region_Detection_by_UFO%3A_Uniqueness%2C_Focusness_and_Objectness.html">374 iccv-2013-Salient Region Detection by UFO: Uniqueness, Focusness and Objectness</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Jiang, Haibin Ling, Jingyi Yu, Jingliang Peng</p><p>Abstract: The goal of saliency detection is to locate important pixels or regions in an image which attract humans ’ visual attention the most. This is a fundamental task whose output may serve as the basis for further computer vision tasks like segmentation, resizing, tracking and so forth. In this paper we propose a novel salient region detection algorithm by integrating three important visual cues namely uniqueness, focusness and objectness (UFO). In particular, uniqueness captures the appearance-derived visual contrast; focusness reflects the fact that salient regions are often photographed in focus; and objectness helps keep completeness of detected salient regions. While uniqueness has been used for saliency detection for long, it is new to integrate focusness and objectness for this purpose. In fact, focusness and objectness both provide important saliency information complementary of uniqueness. In our experiments using public benchmark datasets, we show that, even with a simple pixel level combination of the three components, the proposed approach yields significant improve- ment compared with previously reported methods.</p><p>4 0.59262788 <a title="71-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Contextual_Hypergraph_Modeling_for_Salient_Object_Detection.html">91 iccv-2013-Contextual Hypergraph Modeling for Salient Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xi Li, Yao Li, Chunhua Shen, Anthony Dick, Anton Van_Den_Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Salient object detection aims to locate objects that capture human attention within images. Previous approaches often pose this as a problem of image contrast analysis. In this work, we model an image as a hypergraph that utilizes a set of hyperedges to capture the contextual properties of image pixels or regions. As a result, the problem of salient object detection becomes one of finding salient vertices and hyperedges in the hypergraph. The main advantage of hypergraph modeling is that it takes into account each pixel’s (or region ’s) affinity with its neighborhood as well as its separation from image background. Furthermore, we propose an alternative approach based on centerversus-surround contextual contrast analysis, which performs salient object detection by optimizing a cost-sensitive support vector machine (SVM) objective function. Experimental results on four challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches against the stateof-the-art approaches to salient object detection.</p><p>5 0.55203682 <a title="71-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_Salient_Region_Detection_with_Soft_Image_Abstraction.html">137 iccv-2013-Efficient Salient Region Detection with Soft Image Abstraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming-Ming Cheng, Jonathan Warrell, Wen-Yan Lin, Shuai Zheng, Vibhav Vineet, Nigel Crook</p><p>Abstract: Detecting visually salient regions in images is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision. We propose a novel method to decompose an image into large scale perceptually homogeneous elements for efficient salient region detection, using a soft image abstraction representation. By considering both appearance similarity and spatial distribution of image pixels, the proposed representation abstracts out unnecessary image details, allowing the assignment of comparable saliency values across similar regions, and producing perceptually accurate salient region detection. We evaluate our salient region detection approach on the largest publicly available dataset with pixel accurate annotations. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms 18 alternate methods, reducing the mean absolute error by 25.2% compared to the previous best result, while being computationally more efficient.</p><p>6 0.54119474 <a title="71-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Person_Re-identification_by_Salience_Matching.html">313 iccv-2013-Person Re-identification by Salience Matching</a></p>

An image is characterized by a set of binary images, which are generated by randomly thresholding the image ’s color channels. Based on a Gestalt principle of figure-ground segregation, BMS computes saliency maps by analyzing the topological structure of Boolean maps. BMS is simple to implement and efficient to run. Despite its simplicity, BMS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with ten leading methods on five eye tracking datasets.

<p>Author: Eran Swears, Anthony Hoogs, Kim Boyer</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing functional scene elemeents in video scenes based on the behaviors of moving objects that interact with them is an emerging problem ooff interest. Existing approaches have a limited ability to chharacterize elements such as cross-walks, intersections, andd buildings that have low activity, are multi-modal, or havee indirect evidence. Our approach recognizes the low activvity and multi-model elements (crosswalks/intersections) by introducing a hierarchy of descriptive clusters to fform a pyramid of codebooks that is sparse in the numbber of clusters and dense in content. The incorporation oof local behavioral context such as person-enter-building aand vehicle-parking nearby enables the detection of elemennts that do not have direct motion-based evidence, e.g. buuildings. These two contributions significantly improvee scene element recognition when compared against thhree state-of-the-art approaches. Results are shown on tyypical ground level surveillance video and for the first time on the more complex Wide Area Motion Imagery.</p><p>2 0.94396579 <a title="71-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Optimal_Orthogonal_Basis_and_Image_Assimilation%3A_Motion_Modeling.html">301 iccv-2013-Optimal Orthogonal Basis and Image Assimilation: Motion Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Etienne Huot, Giuseppe Papari, Isabelle Herlin</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes modeling and numerical computation of orthogonal bases, which are used to describe images and motion fields. Motion estimation from image data is then studied on subspaces spanned by these bases. A reduced model is obtained as the Galerkin projection on these subspaces of a physical model, based on Euler and optical flow equations. A data assimilation method is studied, which assimilates coefficients of image data in the reduced model in order to estimate motion coefficients. The approach is first quantified on synthetic data: it demonstrates the interest of model reduction as a compromise between results quality and computational cost. Results obtained on real data are then displayed so as to illustrate the method.</p><p>3 0.86359769 <a title="71-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Space-Time_Robust_Representation_for_Action_Recognition.html">396 iccv-2013-Space-Time Robust Representation for Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolas Ballas, Yi Yang, Zhen-Zhong Lan, Bertrand Delezoide, Françoise Prêteux, Alexander Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of action recognition in unconstrained videos. We propose a novel content driven pooling that leverages space-time context while being robust toward global space-time transformations. Being robust to such transformations is of primary importance in unconstrained videos where the action localizations can drastically shift between frames. Our pooling identifies regions of interest using video structural cues estimated by different saliency functions. To combine the different structural information, we introduce an iterative structure learning algorithm, WSVM (weighted SVM), that determines the optimal saliency layout ofan action model through a sparse regularizer. A new optimization method isproposed to solve the WSVM’ highly non-smooth objective function. We evaluate our approach on standard action datasets (KTH, UCF50 and HMDB). Most noticeably, the accuracy of our algorithm reaches 51.8% on the challenging HMDB dataset which outperforms the state-of-the-art of 7.3% relatively.</p><p>4 0.85946804 <a title="71-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Stacked_Predictive_Sparse_Coding_for_Classification_of_Distinct_Regions_in_Tumor_Histopathology.html">401 iccv-2013-Stacked Predictive Sparse Coding for Classification of Distinct Regions in Tumor Histopathology</a></p>
<p>Author: Hang Chang, Yin Zhou, Paul Spellman, Bahram Parvin</p><p>Abstract: Image-based classification ofhistology sections, in terms of distinct components (e.g., tumor, stroma, normal), provides a series of indices for tumor composition. Furthermore, aggregation of these indices, from each whole slide image (WSI) in a large cohort, can provide predictive models of the clinical outcome. However, performance of the existing techniques is hindered as a result of large technical variations and biological heterogeneities that are always present in a large cohort. We propose a system that automatically learns a series of basis functions for representing the underlying spatial distribution using stacked predictive sparse decomposition (PSD). The learned representation is then fed into the spatial pyramid matching framework (SPM) with a linear SVM classifier. The system has been evaluated for classification of (a) distinct histological components for two cohorts of tumor types, and (b) colony organization of normal and malignant cell lines in 3D cell culture models. Throughput has been increased through the utility of graphical processing unit (GPU), and evalu- ation indicates a superior performance results, compared with previous research.</p><p>5 0.85773027 <a title="71-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Improving_Graph_Matching_via_Density_Maximization.html">214 iccv-2013-Improving Graph Matching via Density Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Chao Wang, Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching has been widely used in various applications in computer vision due to its powerful performance. However, it poses three challenges to image sparse feature matching: (1) The combinatorial nature limits the size of the possible matches; (2) It is sensitive to outliers because the objective function prefers more matches; (3) It works poorly when handling many-to-many object correspondences, due to its assumption of one single cluster for each graph. In this paper, we address these problems with a unified framework—Density Maximization. We propose a graph density local estimator (퐷퐿퐸) to measure the quality of matches. Density Maximization aims to maximize the 퐷퐿퐸 values both locally and globally. The local maximization of 퐷퐿퐸 finds the clusters of nodes as well as eliminates the outliers. The global maximization of 퐷퐿퐸 efficiently refines the matches by exploring a much larger matching space. Our Density Maximization is orthogonal to specific graph matching algorithms. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that it significantly boosts the true matches and enables graph matching to handle both outliers and many-to-many object correspondences.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.85363257 <a title="71-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Category-Independent_Object-Level_Saliency_Detection.html">71 iccv-2013-Category-Independent Object-Level Saliency Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Jian Zhang, Chen Kan, Alexander G.

<p>Author: Alexander G. Schwing, Sanja Fidler, Marc Pollefeys, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose an approach to jointly infer the room layout as well as the objects present in the scene. Towards this goal, we propose a branch and bound algorithm which is guaranteed to retrieve the global optimum of the joint problem. The main difficulty resides in taking into account occlusion in order to not over-count the evidence. We introduce a new decomposition method, which generalizes integral geometry to triangular shapes, and allows us to bound the different terms in constant time. We exploit both geometric cues and object detectors as image features and show large improvements in 2D and 3D object detection over state-of-the-art deformable part-based models.</p><p>4 0.1957832 <a title="72-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-3DNN%3A_Viewpoint_Invariant_3D_Geometry_Matching_for_Scene_Understanding.html">1 iccv-2013-3DNN: Viewpoint Invariant 3D Geometry Matching for Scene Understanding</a></p>
<p>Author: Scott Satkin, Martial Hebert</p><p>Abstract: We present a new algorithm 3DNN (3D NearestNeighbor), which is capable of matching an image with 3D data, independently of the viewpoint from which the image was captured. By leveraging rich annotations associated with each image, our algorithm can automatically produce precise and detailed 3D models of a scene from a single image. Moreover, we can transfer information across images to accurately label and segment objects in a scene. The true benefit of 3DNN compared to a traditional 2D nearest-neighbor approach is that by generalizing across viewpoints, we free ourselves from the need to have training examples captured from all possible viewpoints. Thus, we are able to achieve comparable results using orders of magnitude less data, and recognize objects from never-beforeseen viewpoints. In this work, we describe the 3DNN algorithm and rigorously evaluate its performance for the tasks of geometry estimation and object detection/segmentation. By decoupling the viewpoint and the geometry of an image, we develop a scene matching approach which is truly 100% viewpoint invariant, yielding state-of-the-art performance on challenging data.</p><p>5 0.15701252 <a title="72-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_3D_Scene_Labeling_Using_Fields_of_Trees.html">132 iccv-2013-Efficient 3D Scene Labeling Using Fields of Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Olaf Kähler, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of 3D scene labeling in a structured learning framework. Unlike previous work which uses structured Support VectorMachines, we employ the recently described Decision Tree Field and Regression Tree Field frameworks, which learn the unary and binary terms of a Conditional Random Field from training data. We show this has significant advantages in terms of inference speed, while maintaining similar accuracy. We also demonstrate empirically the importance for overall labeling accuracy of features that make use of prior knowledge about the coarse scene layout such as the location of the ground plane. We show how this coarse layout can be estimated by our framework automatically, and that this information can be used to bootstrap improved accuracy in the detailed labeling.</p><p>6 0.122656 <a title="72-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Hierarchical_Joint_Max-Margin_Learning_of_Mid_and_Top_Level_Representations_for_Visual_Recognition.html">197 iccv-2013-Hierarchical Joint Max-Margin Learning of Mid and Top Level Representations for Visual Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Dahua Lin, Sanja Fidler, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of indoor scene understanding using RGBD data. Towards this goal, we propose a holistic approach that exploits 2D segmentation, 3D geometry, as well as contextual relations between scenes and objects. Specifically, we extend the CPMC [3] framework to 3D in order to generate candidate cuboids, and develop a conditional random field to integrate information from different sources to classify the cuboids. With this formulation, scene classification and 3D object recognition are coupled and can be jointly solved through probabilistic inference. We test the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging NYU v2 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that through effective evidence integration and holistic reasoning, our approach achieves substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.56026852 <a title="72-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Active_MAP_Inference_in_CRFs_for_Efficient_Semantic_Segmentation.html">42 iccv-2013-Active MAP Inference in CRFs for Efficient Semantic Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Naiyan Wang, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: Matrix factorization is a fundamental problem that is often encountered in many computer vision and machine learning tasks. In recent years, enhancing the robustness of matrix factorization methods has attracted much attention in the research community. To benefit from the strengths of full Bayesian treatment over point estimation, we propose here a full Bayesian approach to robust matrix factorization. For the generative process, the model parameters have conjugate priors and the likelihood (or noise model) takes the form of a Laplace mixture. For Bayesian inference, we devise an efficient sampling algorithm by exploiting a hierarchical view of the Laplace distribution. Besides the basic model, we also propose an extension which assumes that the outliers exhibit spatial or temporal proximity as encountered in many computer vision applications. The proposed methods give competitive experimental results when compared with several state-of-the-art methods on some benchmark image and video processing tasks.</p><p>3 0.91066504 <a title="72-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Adaptation_for_Personalized_Image_Search.html">52 iccv-2013-Attribute Adaptation for Personalized Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Adriana Kovashka, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: Current methods learn monolithic attribute predictors, with the assumption that a single model is sufficient to reflect human understanding of a visual attribute. However, in reality, humans vary in how they perceive the association between a named property and image content. For example, two people may have slightly different internal models for what makes a shoe look “formal”, or they may disagree on which of two scenes looks “more cluttered”. Rather than discount these differences as noise, we propose to learn user-specific attribute models. We adapt a generic model trained with annotations from multiple users, tailoring it to satisfy user-specific labels. Furthermore, we propose novel techniques to infer user-specific labels based on transitivity and contradictions in the user’s search history. We demonstrate that adapted attributes improve accuracy over both existing monolithic models as well as models that learn from scratch with user-specific data alone. In addition, we show how adapted attributes are useful to personalize image search, whether with binary or relative attributes.</p><p>4 0.9071722 <a title="72-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Near-Optimal_Cost-Sensitive_Decision_Policy_for_Object_Detection.html">241 iccv-2013-Learning Near-Optimal Cost-Sensitive Decision Policy for Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Tianfu Wu, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Many object detectors, such as AdaBoost, SVM and deformable part-based models (DPM), compute additive scoring functions at a large number of windows scanned over image pyramid, thus computational efficiency is an important consideration beside accuracy performance. In this paper, we present a framework of learning cost-sensitive decision policy which is a sequence of two-sided thresholds to execute early rejection or early acceptance based on the accumulative scores at each step. A decision policy is said to be optimal if it minimizes an empirical global risk function that sums over the loss of false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP), and the cost of computation. While the risk function is very complex due to high-order connections among the two-sided thresholds, we find its upper bound can be optimized by dynamic programming (DP) efficiently and thus say the learned policy is near-optimal. Given the loss of FN and FP and the cost in three numbers, our method can produce a policy on-the-fly for Adaboost, SVM and DPM. In experiments, we show that our decision policy outperforms state-of-the-art cascade methods significantly in terms of speed with similar accuracy performance.</p><p>5 0.9070555 <a title="72-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-3D_Scene_Understanding_by_Voxel-CRF.html">2 iccv-2013-3D Scene Understanding by Voxel-CRF</a></p>
<p>Author: Byung-Soo Kim, Pushmeet Kohli, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: Scene understanding is an important yet very challenging problem in computer vision. In the past few years, researchers have taken advantage of the recent diffusion of depth-RGB (RGB-D) cameras to help simplify the problem of inferring scene semantics. However, while the added 3D geometry is certainly useful to segment out objects with different depth values, it also adds complications in that the 3D geometry is often incorrect because of noisy depth measurements and the actual 3D extent of the objects is usually unknown because of occlusions. In this paper we propose a new method that allows us to jointly refine the 3D reconstruction of the scene (raw depth values) while accurately segmenting out the objects or scene elements from the 3D reconstruction. This is achieved by introducing a new model which we called Voxel-CRF. The Voxel-CRF model is based on the idea of constructing a conditional random field over a 3D volume of interest which captures the semantic and 3D geometric relationships among different elements (voxels) of the scene. Such model allows to jointly estimate (1) a dense voxel-based 3D reconstruction and (2) the semantic labels associated with each voxel even in presence of par- tial occlusions using an approximate yet efficient inference strategy. We evaluated our method on the challenging NYU Depth dataset (Version 1and 2). Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive accuracy in inferring scene semantics and visually appealing results in improving the quality of the 3D reconstruction. We also demonstrate an interesting application of object removal and scene completion from RGB-D images.</p><p>6 0.906627 <a title="72-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Spoken_Attributes%3A_Mixing_Binary_and_Relative_Attributes_to_Say_the_Right_Thing.html">399 iccv-2013-Spoken Attributes: Mixing Binary and Relative Attributes to Say the Right Thing</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaoyu Ding, Wen-Sheng Chu, Fernando De_La_Torre, Jeffery F. Cohn, Qiao Wang</p><p>Abstract: Automatic facial Action Unit (AU) detection from video is a long-standing problem in facial expression analysis. AU detection is typically posed as a classification problem between frames or segments of positive examples and negative ones, where existing work emphasizes the use of different features or classifiers. In this paper, we propose a method called Cascade of Tasks (CoT) that combines the use ofdifferent tasks (i.e., , frame, segment and transition)for AU event detection. We train CoT in a sequential manner embracing diversity, which ensures robustness and generalization to unseen data. In addition to conventional framebased metrics that evaluate frames independently, we propose a new event-based metric to evaluate detection performance at event-level. We show how the CoT method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both frame-based and event-based metrics, across three public datasets that differ in complexity: CK+, FERA and RUFACS.</p><p>3 0.10589412 <a title="243-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Capturing_Global_Semantic_Relationships_for_Facial_Action_Unit_Recognition.html">69 iccv-2013-Capturing Global Semantic Relationships for Facial Action Unit Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziheng Wang, Yongqiang Li, Shangfei Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of facial action unit (AU) recognition by exploiting the complex semantic relationships among AUs, which carry crucial top-down information yet have not been thoroughly exploited. Towards this goal, we build a hierarchical model that combines the bottom-level image features and the top-level AU relationships to jointly recognize AUs in a principled manner. The proposed model has two major advantages over existing methods. 1) Unlike methods that can only capture local pair-wise AU dependencies, our model is developed upon the restricted Boltzmann machine and therefore can exploit the global relationships among AUs. 2) Although AU relationships are influenced by many related factors such as facial expressions, these factors are generally ignored by the current methods. Our model, however, can successfully capture them to more accurately characterize the AU relationships. Efficient learning and inference algorithms of the proposed model are also developed. Experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in modelling complex AU relationships as well as its superior AU recognition performance over existing approaches.</p><p>4 0.067915812 <a title="243-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Space-Time_Tradeoffs_in_Photo_Sequencing.html">397 iccv-2013-Space-Time Tradeoffs in Photo Sequencing</a></p>
<p>Author: Tali Dekel_(Basha), Yael Moses, Shai Avidan</p><p>Abstract: Photo-sequencing is the problem of recovering the temporal order of a set of still images of a dynamic event, taken asynchronously by a set of uncalibrated cameras. Solving this problem is a first, crucial step for analyzing (or visualizing) the dynamic content of the scene captured by a large number of freely moving spectators. We propose a geometric based solution, followed by rank aggregation to . ac . i l avidan@ eng .t au . ac . i l the photo-sequencing problem. Our algorithm trades spatial certainty for temporal certainty. Whereas the previous solution proposed by [4] relies on two images taken from the same static camera to eliminate uncertainty in space, we drop the static-camera assumption and replace it with temporal information available from images taken from the same (moving) camera. Our method thus overcomes the limitation of the static-camera assumption, and scales much better with the duration of the event and the spread of cameras in space. We present successful results on challenging real data sets and large scale synthetic data (250 images).</p><p>5 0.066994414 <a title="243-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Segmentation_and_Pose_Tracking_of_Human_in_Natural_Videos.html">225 iccv-2013-Joint Segmentation and Pose Tracking of Human in Natural Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Taegyu Lim, Seunghoon Hong, Bohyung Han, Joon Hee Han</p><p>Abstract: We propose an on-line algorithm to extract a human by foreground/background segmentation and estimate pose of the human from the videos captured by moving cameras. We claim that a virtuous cycle can be created by appropriate interactions between the two modules to solve individual problems. This joint estimation problem is divided into two subproblems, , foreground/background segmentation and pose tracking, which alternate iteratively for optimization; segmentation step generates foreground mask for human pose tracking, and human pose tracking step provides foreground response map for segmentation. The final solution is obtained when the iterative procedure converges. We evaluate our algorithm quantitatively and qualitatively in real videos involving various challenges, and present its outstandingperformance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques for segmentation and pose estimation.</p><p>6 0.062051434 <a title="243-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Event_Detection_in_Complex_Scenes_Using_Interval_Temporal_Constraints.html">146 iccv-2013-Event Detection in Complex Scenes Using Interval Temporal Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Yifan Zhang, Qiang Ji, Hanqing Lu</p><p>Abstract: In complex scenes with multiple atomic events happening sequentially or in parallel, detecting each individual event separately may not always obtain robust and reliable result. It is essential to detect them in a holistic way which incorporates the causality and temporal dependency among them to compensate the limitation of current computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose an interval temporal constrained dynamic Bayesian network to extendAllen ’s interval algebra network (IAN) [2]from a deterministic static model to a probabilistic dynamic system, which can not only capture the complex interval temporal relationships, but also model the evolution dynamics and handle the uncertainty from the noisy visual observation. In the model, the topology of the IAN on each time slice and the interlinks between the time slices are discovered by an advanced structure learning method. The duration of the event and the unsynchronized time lags between two correlated event intervals are captured by a duration model, so that we can better determine the temporal boundary of the event. Empirical results on two real world datasets show the power of the proposed interval temporal constrained model.</p><p>5 0.61303729 <a title="243-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Space-Time_Tradeoffs_in_Photo_Sequencing.html">397 iccv-2013-Space-Time Tradeoffs in Photo Sequencing</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohit Gupta, Daisuke Iso, Shree K. Nayar</p><p>Abstract: Exposure bracketing for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging involves capturing several images of the scene at different exposures. If either the camera or the scene moves during capture, the captured images must be registered. Large exposure differences between bracketed images lead to inaccurate registration, resulting in artifacts such as ghosting (multiple copies of scene objects) and blur. We present two techniques, one for image capture (Fibonacci exposure bracketing) and one for image registration (generalized registration), to prevent such motion-related artifacts. Fibonacci bracketing involves capturing a sequence of images such that each exposure time is the sum of the previous N(N > 1) exposures. Generalized registration involves estimating motion between sums of contiguous sets of frames, instead of between individual frames. Together, the two techniques ensure that motion is always estimated betweenframes of the same total exposure time. This results in HDR images and videos which have both a large dynamic range andminimal motion-relatedartifacts. We show, by results for several real-world indoor and outdoor scenes, that theproposed approach significantly outperforms several ex- isting bracketing schemes.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.63853067 <a title="243-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Slow_Features_for_Behaviour_Analysis.html">243 iccv-2013-Learning Slow Features for Behaviour Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Lazaros Zafeiriou, Mihalis A. Nicolaou, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Symeon Nikitidis, Maja Pantic</p><p>Abstract: A recently introduced latent feature learning technique for time varying dynamic phenomena analysis is the socalled Slow Feature Analysis (SFA). SFA is a deterministic component analysis technique for multi-dimensional sequences that by minimizing the variance of the first order time derivative approximation of the input signal finds uncorrelated projections that extract slowly-varying features ordered by their temporal consistency and constancy. In this paper, we propose a number of extensions in both the deterministic and the probabilistic SFA optimization frameworks. In particular, we derive a novel deterministic SFA algorithm that is able to identify linear projections that extract the common slowest varying features of two or more sequences. In addition, we propose an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to perform inference in a probabilistic formulation of SFA and similarly extend it in order to handle two and more time varying data sequences. Moreover, we demonstrate that the probabilistic SFA (EMSFA) algorithm that discovers the common slowest varying latent space of multiple sequences can be combined with dynamic time warping techniques for robust sequence timealignment. The proposed SFA algorithms were applied for facial behavior analysis demonstrating their usefulness and appropriateness for this task.</p><p>3 0.61713588 <a title="243-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Simultaneous_Clustering_and_Tracklet_Linking_for_Multi-face_Tracking_in_Videos.html">393 iccv-2013-Simultaneous Clustering and Tracklet Linking for Multi-face Tracking in Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Baoyuan Wu, Siwei Lyu, Bao-Gang Hu, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel method that simultaneously clusters and associates short sequences of detected faces (termed as face tracklets) in videos. The rationale of our method is that face tracklet clustering and linking are related problems that can benefit from the solutions of each other. Our method is based on a hidden Markov random field model that represents the joint dependencies of cluster labels and tracklet linking associations . We provide an efficient algorithm based on constrained clustering and optimal matching for the simultaneous inference of cluster labels and tracklet associations. We demonstrate significant improvements on the state-of-the-art results in face tracking and clustering performances on several video datasets.</p><p>4 0.60389489 <a title="243-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Measuring_Flow_Complexity_in_Videos.html">263 iccv-2013-Measuring Flow Complexity in Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Saad Ali</p><p>Abstract: In this paper a notion of flow complexity that measures the amount of interaction among objects is introduced and an approach to compute it directly from a video sequence is proposed. The approach employs particle trajectories as the input representation of motion and maps it into a ‘braid’ based representation. The mapping is based on the observation that 2D trajectories of particles take the form of a braid in space-time due to the intermingling among particles over time. As a result of this mapping, the problem of estimating the flow complexity from particle trajectories becomes the problem of estimating braid complexity, which in turn can be computed by measuring the topological entropy of a braid. For this purpose recently developed mathematical tools from braid theory are employed which allow rapid computation of topological entropy of braids. The approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of open source videos depicting variations in terms of types of moving objects, scene layout, camera view angle, motion patterns, and object densities. The results show that the proposed approach is able to quantify the complexity of the flow, and at the same time provides useful insights about the sources of the complexity.</p><p>5 0.58964473 <a title="243-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Random_Forest_Manifold_Alignment_for_Lipreading.html">437 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Random Forest Manifold Alignment for Lipreading</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuru Pei, Tae-Kyun Kim, Hongbin Zha</p><p>Abstract: Lipreading from visual channels remains a challenging topic considering the various speaking characteristics. In this paper, we address an efficient lipreading approach by investigating the unsupervised random forest manifold alignment (RFMA). The density random forest is employed to estimate affinity of patch trajectories in speaking facial videos. We propose novel criteria for node splitting to avoid the rank-deficiency in learning density forests. By virtue of the hierarchical structure of random forests, the trajectory affinities are measured efficiently, which are used to find embeddings of the speaking video clips by a graph-based algorithm. Lipreading is formulated as matching between manifolds of query and reference video clips. We employ the manifold alignment technique for matching, where the L∞norm-based manifold-to-manifold distance is proposed to find the matching pairs. We apply this random forest manifold alignment technique to various video data sets captured by consumer cameras. The experiments demonstrate that lipreading can be performed effectively, and outperform state-of-the-arts.</p><p>6 0.51833194 <a title="243-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Coupled_Dictionary_and_Feature_Space_Learning_with_Applications_to_Cross-Domain_Image_Synthesis_and_Recognition.html">96 iccv-2013-Coupled Dictionary and Feature Space Learning with Applications to Cross-Domain Image Synthesis and Recognition</a></p>

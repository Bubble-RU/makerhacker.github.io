<p>Author: Jimei Yang, Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: We present a hybrid parametric and nonparametric algorithm, exemplar cut, for generating class-specific object segmentation hypotheses. For the parametric part, we train a pylon model on a hierarchical region tree as the energy function for segmentation. For the nonparametric part, we match the input image with each exemplar by using regions to obtain a score which augments the energy function from the pylon model. Our method thus generates a set of highly plausible segmentation hypotheses by solving a series of exemplar augmented graph cuts. Experimental results on the Graz and PASCAL datasets show that the proposed algorithm achievesfavorable segmentationperformance against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and accuracy.</p><p>3 0.40083224 <a title="203-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Recognising_Human-Object_Interaction_via_Exemplar_Based_Modelling.html">344 iccv-2013-Recognising Human-Object Interaction via Exemplar Based Modelling</a></p>
<p>Author: Jian-Fang Hu, Wei-Shi Zheng, Jianhuang Lai, Shaogang Gong, Tao Xiang</p><p>Abstract: Human action can be recognised from a single still image by modelling Human-object interaction (HOI), which infers the mutual spatial structure information between human and object as well as their appearance. Existing approaches rely heavily on accurate detection of human and object, and estimation of human pose. They are thus sensitive to large variations of human poses, occlusion and unsatisfactory detection of small size objects. To overcome this limitation, a novel exemplar based approach is proposed in this work. Our approach learns a set of spatial pose-object interaction exemplars, which are density functions describing how a person is interacting with a manipulated object for different activities spatially in a probabilistic way. A representation based on our HOI exemplar thus has great potential for being robust to the errors in human/object detection and pose estimation. A new framework consists of a proposed exemplar based HOI descriptor and an activity specific matching model that learns the parameters is formulated for robust human activity recog- nition. Experiments on two benchmark activity datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach obtains state-ofthe-art performance.</p><p>4 0.19330728 <a title="203-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Feature_Weighting_via_Optimal_Thresholding_for_Video_Analysis.html">163 iccv-2013-Feature Weighting via Optimal Thresholding for Video Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongwen Xu, Yi Yang, Ivor Tsang, Nicu Sebe, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Fusion of multiple features can boost the performance of large-scale visual classification and detection tasks like TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection (MED) competition [1]. In this paper, we propose a novel feature fusion approach, namely Feature Weighting via Optimal Thresholding (FWOT) to effectively fuse various features. FWOT learns the weights, thresholding and smoothing parameters in a joint framework to combine the decision values obtained from all the individual features and the early fusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the weight and threshold factors of fusion problem simultaneously. Compared to state-of-the-art fusion algorithms, our approach achieves promising improvements on HMDB [8] action recognition dataset and CCV [5] video classification dataset. In addition, experiments on two TRECVID MED 2011 collections show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion methods for complex event detection.</p><p>5 0.17131262 <a title="203-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Direct_Super-Resolution_by_Simple_Functions.html">156 iccv-2013-Fast Direct Super-Resolution by Simple Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Chih-Yuan Yang, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: The goal of single-image super-resolution is to generate a high-quality high-resolution image based on a given low-resolution input. It is an ill-posed problem which requires exemplars or priors to better reconstruct the missing high-resolution image details. In this paper, we propose to split the feature space into numerous subspaces and collect exemplars to learn priors for each subspace, thereby creating effective mapping functions. The use of split input space facilitates both feasibility of using simple functionsfor super-resolution, and efficiency ofgenerating highresolution results. High-quality high-resolution images are reconstructed based on the effective learned priors. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed algorithmperforms efficiently and effectively over state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.1540951 <a title="203-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Bird_Part_Localization_Using_Exemplar-Based_Models_with_Enforced_Pose_and_Subcategory_Consistency.html">62 iccv-2013-Bird Part Localization Using Exemplar-Based Models with Enforced Pose and Subcategory Consistency</a></p>

We present a method for synthesizing complex, photo-realistic facade images, from a single example. After parsing the example image into its semantic components, a tiling for it is generated. Novel tilings can then be created, yielding facade textures with different dimensions or with occluded parts inpainted. A genetic algorithm guides the novel facades as well as inpainted parts to be consistent with the example, both in terms of their overall structure and their detailed textures. Promising results for multiple standard datasets in particular for the different building styles they contain demonstrate the potential of the method. – –</p><p>5 0.50715697 <a title="203-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Feature_Weighting_via_Optimal_Thresholding_for_Video_Analysis.html">163 iccv-2013-Feature Weighting via Optimal Thresholding for Video Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Dan Xie, Sinisa Todorovic, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach to localizing functional objects in surveillance videos without domain knowledge about semantic object classes that may appear in the scene. Functional objects do not have discriminative appearance and shape, but they affect behavior of people in the scene. For example, they “attract” people to approach them for satisfying certain needs (e.g., vending machines could quench thirst), or “repel” people to avoid them (e.g., grass lawns). Therefore, functional objects can be viewed as “dark matter”, emanating “dark energy ” that affects people ’s trajectories in the video. To detect “dark matter” and infer their “dark energy ” field, we extend the Lagrangian mechanics. People are treated as particle-agents with latent intents to approach “dark matter” and thus satisfy their needs, where their motions are subject to a composite “dark energy ” field of all functional objects in the scene. We make the assumption that people take globally optimal paths toward the intended “dark matter” while avoiding latent obstacles. A Bayesian framework is used to probabilistically model: people ’s trajectories and intents, constraint map of the scene, and locations of functional objects. A data-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process is used for inference. Our evaluation on videos of public squares and courtyards demonstrates our effectiveness in localizing functional objects and predicting people ’s trajectories in unobserved parts of the video footage.</p><p>2 0.85893703 <a title="203-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven_Efficiently-Sampled_Sparse_Graphical_Models_for_Concurrent_Tumor_Segmentation_and_Atlas_Registration.html">432 iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven Efficiently-Sampled Sparse Graphical Models for Concurrent Tumor Segmentation and Atlas Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Sarah Parisot, William Wells_III, Stéphane Chemouny, Hugues Duffau, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based methods have become popular in recent years and have successfully addressed tasks like segmentation and deformable registration. Their main strength is optimality of the obtained solution while their main limitation is the lack of precision due to the grid-like representations and the discrete nature of the quantized search space. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for combined segmentation/registration of brain tumors that adapts graph and sampling resolution according to the image content. To this end we estimate the segmentation and registration marginals towards adaptive graph resolution and intelligent definition of the search space. This information is considered in a hierarchical framework where uncertainties are propagated in a natural manner. State of the art results in the joint segmentation/registration of brain images with low-grade gliomas demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>3 0.85767961 <a title="203-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Bayesian_3D_Tracking_from_Monocular_Video.html">58 iccv-2013-Bayesian 3D Tracking from Monocular Video</a></p>

We develop a Bayesian modeling approach for tracking people in 3D from monocular video with unknown cameras. Modeling in 3D provides natural explanations for occlusions and smoothness discontinuities that result from projection, and allows priors on velocity and smoothness to be grounded in physical quantities: meters and seconds vs. pixels and frames. We pose the problem in the context of data association, in which observations are assigned to tracks. A correct application of Bayesian inference to multitarget tracking must address the fact that the model’s dimension changes as tracks are added or removed, and thus, posterior densities of different hypotheses are not comparable. We address this by marginalizing out the trajectory parameters so the resulting posterior over data associations has constant dimension. This is made tractable by using (a) Gaussian process priors for smooth trajectories and (b) approximately Gaussian likelihood functions. Our approach provides a principled method for incorporating multiple sources of evidence; we present results using both optical flow and object detector outputs. Results are comparable to recent work on 3D tracking and, unlike others, our method requires no pre-calibrated cameras.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.79925495 <a title="203-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-How_Related_Exemplars_Help_Complex_Event_Detection_in_Web_Videos%3F.html">203 iccv-2013-How Related Exemplars Help Complex Event Detection in Web Videos?</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Yang, Zhigang Ma, Zhongwen Xu, Shuicheng Yan, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Compared to visual concepts such as actions, scenes and objects, complex event is a higher level abstraction of longer video sequences. For example, a “marriage proposal” event is described by multiple objects (e.g., ring, faces), scenes (e.g., in a restaurant, outdoor) and actions (e.g., kneeling down). The positive exemplars which exactly convey the precise semantic of an event are hard to obtain. It would be beneficial to utilize the related exemplars for complex event detection. However, the semantic correlations between related exemplars and the target event vary substantially as relatedness assessment is subjective. Two related exemplars can be about completely different events, e.g., in the TRECVID MED dataset, both bicycle riding and equestrianism are labeled as related to “attempting a bike trick” event. To tackle the subjectiveness of human assessment, our algorithm automatically evaluates how positive the related exemplars are for the detection of an event and uses them on an exemplar-specific basis. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is able to utilize related exemplars adaptively, and the algorithm gains good perform- z. ance for complex event detection.</p><p>5 0.77818227 <a title="203-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Alternating_Regression_Forests_for_Object_Detection_and_Pose_Estimation.html">47 iccv-2013-Alternating Regression Forests for Object Detection and Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel Schulter, Christian Leistner, Paul Wohlhart, Peter M. Roth, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: We present Alternating Regression Forests (ARFs), a novel regression algorithm that learns a Random Forest by optimizing a global loss function over all trees. This interrelates the information of single trees during the training phase and results in more accurate predictions. ARFs can minimize any differentiable regression loss without sacrificing the appealing properties of Random Forests, like low computational complexity during both, training and testing. Inspired by recent developments for classification [19], we derive a new algorithm capable of dealing with different regression loss functions, discuss its properties and investigate the relations to other methods like Boosted Trees. We evaluate ARFs on standard machine learning benchmarks, where we observe better generalization power compared to both standard Random Forests and Boosted Trees. Moreover, we apply the proposed regressor to two computer vision applications: object detection and head pose estimation from depth images. ARFs outperform the Random Forest baselines in both tasks, illustrating the importance of optimizing a common loss function for all trees.</p><p>6 0.7655369 <a title="203-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Object_Tracking_with_Online_Multi-lifespan_Dictionary_Learning.html">359 iccv-2013-Robust Object Tracking with Online Multi-lifespan Dictionary Learning</a></p>

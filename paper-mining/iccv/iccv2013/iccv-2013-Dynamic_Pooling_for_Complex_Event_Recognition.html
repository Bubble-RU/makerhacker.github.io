<p>Author: Nicolas Ballas, Yi Yang, Zhen-Zhong Lan, Bertrand Delezoide, Françoise Prêteux, Alexander Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of action recognition in unconstrained videos. We propose a novel content driven pooling that leverages space-time context while being robust toward global space-time transformations. Being robust to such transformations is of primary importance in unconstrained videos where the action localizations can drastically shift between frames. Our pooling identifies regions of interest using video structural cues estimated by different saliency functions. To combine the different structural information, we introduce an iterative structure learning algorithm, WSVM (weighted SVM), that determines the optimal saliency layout ofan action model through a sparse regularizer. A new optimization method isproposed to solve the WSVM’ highly non-smooth objective function. We evaluate our approach on standard action datasets (KTH, UCF50 and HMDB). Most noticeably, the accuracy of our algorithm reaches 51.8% on the challenging HMDB dataset which outperforms the state-of-the-art of 7.3% relatively.</p><p>3 0.24973819 <a title="127-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Compositional_Models_for_Video_Event_Detection%3A_A_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_Latent_Variable_Approach.html">85 iccv-2013-Compositional Models for Video Event Detection: A Multiple Kernel Learning Latent Variable Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Arash Vahdat, Kevin Cannons, Greg Mori, Sangmin Oh, Ilseo Kim</p><p>Abstract: We present a compositional model for video event detection. A video is modeled using a collection of both global and segment-level features and kernel functions are employed for similarity comparisons. The locations of salient, discriminative video segments are treated as a latent variable, allowing the model to explicitly ignore portions of the video that are unimportant for classification. A novel, multiple kernel learning (MKL) latent support vector machine (SVM) is defined, that is used to combine and re-weight multiple feature types in a principled fashion while simultaneously operating within the latent variable framework. The compositional nature of the proposed model allows it to respond directly to the challenges of temporal clutter and intra-class variation, which are prevalent in unconstrained internet videos. Experimental results on the TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection 2011 (MED11) dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the method.</p><p>4 0.23327166 <a title="127-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Mining_Motion_Atoms_and_Phrases_for_Complex_Action_Recognition.html">265 iccv-2013-Mining Motion Atoms and Phrases for Complex Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Limin Wang, Yu Qiao, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes motion atom and phrase as a midlevel temporal “part” for representing and classifying complex action. Motion atom is defined as an atomic part of action, and captures the motion information of action video in a short temporal scale. Motion phrase is a temporal composite of multiple motion atoms with an AND/OR structure, which further enhances the discriminative ability of motion atoms by incorporating temporal constraints in a longer scale. Specifically, given a set of weakly labeled action videos, we firstly design a discriminative clustering method to automatically discovera set ofrepresentative motion atoms. Then, based on these motion atoms, we mine effective motion phrases with high discriminative and representativepower. We introduce a bottom-upphrase construction algorithm and a greedy selection method for this mining task. We examine the classification performance of the motion atom and phrase based representation on two complex action datasets: Olympic Sports and UCF50. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance over recent published methods on both datasets.</p><p>5 0.21112691 <a title="127-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Event_Detection_in_Complex_Scenes_Using_Interval_Temporal_Constraints.html">146 iccv-2013-Event Detection in Complex Scenes Using Interval Temporal Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yifan Zhang, Qiang Ji, Hanqing Lu</p><p>Abstract: In complex scenes with multiple atomic events happening sequentially or in parallel, detecting each individual event separately may not always obtain robust and reliable result. It is essential to detect them in a holistic way which incorporates the causality and temporal dependency among them to compensate the limitation of current computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose an interval temporal constrained dynamic Bayesian network to extendAllen ’s interval algebra network (IAN) [2]from a deterministic static model to a probabilistic dynamic system, which can not only capture the complex interval temporal relationships, but also model the evolution dynamics and handle the uncertainty from the noisy visual observation. In the model, the topology of the IAN on each time slice and the interlinks between the time slices are discovered by an advanced structure learning method. The duration of the event and the unsynchronized time lags between two correlated event intervals are captured by a duration model, so that we can better determine the temporal boundary of the event. Empirical results on two real world datasets show the power of the proposed interval temporal constrained model.</p><p>6 0.19849743 <a title="127-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Action_Recognition_and_Localization_by_Hierarchical_Space-Time_Segments.html">37 iccv-2013-Action Recognition and Localization by Hierarchical Space-Time Segments</a></p>

<p>Author: Ping Wei, Yibiao Zhao, Nanning Zheng, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing the events and objects in the video sequence are two challenging tasks due to the complex temporal structures and the large appearance variations. In this paper, we propose a 4D human-object interaction model, where the two tasks jointly boost each other. Our human-object interaction is defined in 4D space: i) the cooccurrence and geometric constraints of human pose and object in 3D space; ii) the sub-events transition and objects coherence in 1D temporal dimension. We represent the structure of events, sub-events and objects in a hierarchical graph. For an input RGB-depth video, we design a dynamic programming beam search algorithm to: i) segment the video, ii) recognize the events, and iii) detect the objects simultaneously. For evaluation, we built a large-scale multiview 3D event dataset which contains 3815 video sequences and 383,036 RGBD frames captured by the Kinect cameras. The experiment results on this dataset show the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>4 0.7969799 <a title="127-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Concurrent_Action_Detection_with_Structural_Prediction.html">86 iccv-2013-Concurrent Action Detection with Structural Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Wei, Nanning Zheng, Yibiao Zhao, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Action recognition has often been posed as a classification problem, which assumes that a video sequence only have one action class label and different actions are independent. However, a single human body can perform multiple concurrent actions at the same time, and different actions interact with each other. This paper proposes a concurrent action detection model where the action detection is formulated as a structural prediction problem. In this model, an interval in a video sequence can be described by multiple action labels. An detected action interval is determined both by the unary local detector and the relations with other actions. We use a wavelet feature to represent the action sequence, and design a composite temporal logic descriptor to describe the action relations. The model parameters are trained by structural SVM learning. Given a long video sequence, a sequential decision window search algorithm is designed to detect the actions. Experiments on our new collected concurrent action dataset demonstrate the strength of our method.</p><p>5 0.79381973 <a title="127-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-ACTIVE%3A_Activity_Concept_Transitions_in_Video_Event_Classification.html">4 iccv-2013-ACTIVE: Activity Concept Transitions in Video Event Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Chen Sun, Ram Nevatia</p><p>Abstract: The goal of high level event classification from videos is to assign a single, high level event label to each query video. Traditional approaches represent each video as a set of low level features and encode it into a fixed length feature vector (e.g. Bag-of-Words), which leave a big gap between low level visual features and high level events. Our paper tries to address this problem by exploiting activity concept transitions in video events (ACTIVE). A video is treated as a sequence of short clips, all of which are observations corresponding to latent activity concept variables in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We propose to apply Fisher Kernel techniques so that the concept transitions over time can be encoded into a compact and fixed length feature vector very efficiently. Our approach can utilize concept annotations from independent datasets, and works well even with a very small number of training samples. Experiments on the challenging NIST TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection (MED) dataset shows our approach performs favorably over the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.76690358 <a title="127-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Maximum_Margin_Temporal_Warping_for_Action_Recognition.html">240 iccv-2013-Learning Maximum Margin Temporal Warping for Action Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Chi Xu, Li Cheng</p><p>Abstract: We tackle the practical problem of hand pose estimation from a single noisy depth image. A dedicated three-step pipeline is proposed: Initial estimation step provides an initial estimation of the hand in-plane orientation and 3D location; Candidate generation step produces a set of 3D pose candidate from the Hough voting space with the help of the rotational invariant depth features; Verification step delivers the final 3D hand pose as the solution to an optimization problem. We analyze the depth noises, and suggest tips to minimize their negative impacts on the overall performance. Our approach is able to work with Kinecttype noisy depth images, and reliably produces pose estimations of general motions efficiently (12 frames per second). Extensive experiments are conducted to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the performance with respect to the state-of-the-art methods that have access to additional RGB images. Our approach is shown to deliver on par or even better results.</p><p>2 0.97142154 <a title="127-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Unifying_Nuclear_Norm_and_Bilinear_Factorization_Approaches_for_Low-Rank_Matrix_Decomposition.html">434 iccv-2013-Unifying Nuclear Norm and Bilinear Factorization Approaches for Low-Rank Matrix Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ricardo Cabral, Fernando De_La_Torre, João P. Costeira, Alexandre Bernardino</p><p>Abstract: Low rank models have been widely usedfor the representation of shape, appearance or motion in computer vision problems. Traditional approaches to fit low rank models make use of an explicit bilinear factorization. These approaches benefit from fast numerical methods for optimization and easy kernelization. However, they suffer from serious local minima problems depending on the loss function and the amount/type of missing data. Recently, these lowrank models have alternatively been formulated as convex problems using the nuclear norm regularizer; unlike factorization methods, their numerical solvers are slow and it is unclear how to kernelize them or to impose a rank a priori. This paper proposes a unified approach to bilinear factorization and nuclear norm regularization, that inherits the benefits of both. We analyze the conditions under which these approaches are equivalent. Moreover, based on this analysis, we propose a new optimization algorithm and a “rank continuation ” strategy that outperform state-of-theart approaches for Robust PCA, Structure from Motion and Photometric Stereo with outliers and missing data.</p><p>3 0.95812625 <a title="127-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Object_Segmentation_in_Unconstrained_Video.html">160 iccv-2013-Fast Object Segmentation in Unconstrained Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Anestis Papazoglou, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: We present a technique for separating foreground objects from the background in a video. Our method isfast, , fully automatic, and makes minimal assumptions about the video. This enables handling essentially unconstrained settings, including rapidly moving background, arbitrary object motion and appearance, and non-rigid deformations and articulations. In experiments on two datasets containing over 1400 video shots, our method outperforms a state-of-theart background subtraction technique [4] as well as methods based on clustering point tracks [6, 18, 19]. Moreover, it performs comparably to recent video object segmentation methods based on objectproposals [14, 16, 27], while being orders of magnitude faster.</p><p>4 0.94544089 <a title="127-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Dictionary_Learning_by_Error_Source_Decomposition.html">354 iccv-2013-Robust Dictionary Learning by Error Source Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhuoyuan Chen, Ying Wu</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity models have recently shown great promise in many vision tasks. Using a learned dictionary in sparsity models can in general outperform predefined bases in clean data. In practice, both training and testing data may be corrupted and contain noises and outliers. Although recent studies attempted to cope with corrupted data and achieved encouraging results in testing phase, how to handle corruption in training phase still remains a very difficult problem. In contrast to most existing methods that learn the dictionaryfrom clean data, this paper is targeted at handling corruptions and outliers in training data for dictionary learning. We propose a general method to decompose the reconstructive residual into two components: a non-sparse component for small universal noises and a sparse component for large outliers, respectively. In addition, , further analysis reveals the connection between our approach and the “partial” dictionary learning approach, updating only part of the prototypes (or informative codewords) with remaining (or noisy codewords) fixed. Experiments on synthetic data as well as real applications have shown satisfactory per- formance of this new robust dictionary learning approach.</p><p>5 0.94110411 <a title="127-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Interactive_Markerless_Articulated_Hand_Motion_Tracking_Using_RGB_and_Depth_Data.html">218 iccv-2013-Interactive Markerless Articulated Hand Motion Tracking Using RGB and Depth Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Srinath Sridhar, Antti Oulasvirta, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: Tracking the articulated 3D motion of the hand has important applications, for example, in human–computer interaction and teleoperation. We present a novel method that can capture a broad range of articulated hand motions at interactive rates. Our hybrid approach combines, in a voting scheme, a discriminative, part-based pose retrieval method with a generative pose estimation method based on local optimization. Color information from a multiview RGB camera setup along with a person-specific hand model are used by the generative method to find the pose that best explains the observed images. In parallel, our discriminative pose estimation method uses fingertips detected on depth data to estimate a complete or partial pose of the hand by adopting a part-based pose retrieval strategy. This part-based strategy helps reduce the search space drastically in comparison to a global pose retrieval strategy. Quantitative results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging sequences and a near-realtime performance of 10 fps on a desktop computer.</p><p>6 0.93415052 <a title="127-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_Novel_Earth_Mover%27s_Distance_Methodology_for_Image_Matching_with_Gaussian_Mixture_Models.html">25 iccv-2013-A Novel Earth Mover's Distance Methodology for Image Matching with Gaussian Mixture Models</a></p>

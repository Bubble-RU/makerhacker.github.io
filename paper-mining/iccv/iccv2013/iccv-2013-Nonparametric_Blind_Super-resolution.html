<p>Author: Netalee Efrat, Daniel Glasner, Alexander Apartsin, Boaz Nadler, Anat Levin</p><p>Abstract: Over the past decade, single image Super-Resolution (SR) research has focused on developing sophisticated image priors, leading to significant advances. Estimating and incorporating the blur model, that relates the high-res and low-res images, has received much less attention, however. In particular, the reconstruction constraint, namely that the blurred and downsampled high-res output should approximately equal the low-res input image, has been either ignored or applied with default fixed blur models. In this work, we examine the relative importance ofthe imageprior and the reconstruction constraint. First, we show that an accurate reconstruction constraint combined with a simple gradient regularization achieves SR results almost as good as those of state-of-the-art algorithms with sophisticated image priors. Second, we study both empirically and theoretically the sensitivity of SR algorithms to the blur model assumed in the reconstruction constraint. We find that an accurate blur model is more important than a sophisticated image prior. Finally, using real camera data, we demonstrate that the default blur models of various SR algorithms may differ from the camera blur, typically leading to over- smoothed results. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately estimating camera blur in reconstructing raw low- res images acquired by an actual camera.</p><p>3 0.23981491 <a title="293-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Scene_Deblurring.html">129 iccv-2013-Dynamic Scene Deblurring</a></p>
<p>Author: Tae Hyun Kim, Byeongjoo Ahn, Kyoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: Most conventional single image deblurring methods assume that the underlying scene is static and the blur is caused by only camera shake. In this paper, in contrast to this restrictive assumption, we address the deblurring problem of general dynamic scenes which contain multiple moving objects as well as camera shake. In case of dynamic scenes, moving objects and background have different blur motions, so the segmentation of the motion blur is required for deblurring each distinct blur motion accurately. Thus, we propose a novel energy model designed with the weighted sum of multiple blur data models, which estimates different motion blurs and their associated pixelwise weights, and resulting sharp image. In this framework, the local weights are determined adaptively and get high values when the corresponding data models have high data fidelity. And, the weight information is used for the segmentation of the motion blur. Non-local regularization of weights are also incorporated to produce more reliable segmentation results. A convex optimization-based method is used for the solution of the proposed energy model. Exper- imental results demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches in deblurring both dynamic scenes and static scenes.</p><p>4 0.22531532 <a title="293-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Deblurring_by_Example_Using_Dense_Correspondence.html">103 iccv-2013-Deblurring by Example Using Dense Correspondence</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoav Hacohen, Eli Shechtman, Dani Lischinski</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new method for deblurring photos using a sharp reference example that contains some shared content with the blurry photo. Most previous deblurring methods that exploit information from other photos require an accurately registered photo of the same static scene. In contrast, our method aims to exploit reference images where the shared content may have undergone substantial photometric and non-rigid geometric transformations, as these are the kind of reference images most likely to be found in personal photo albums. Our approach builds upon a recent method for examplebased deblurring using non-rigid dense correspondence (NRDC) [11] and extends it in two ways. First, we suggest exploiting information from the reference image not only for blur kernel estimation, but also as a powerful local prior for the non-blind deconvolution step. Second, we introduce a simple yet robust technique for spatially varying blur estimation, rather than assuming spatially uniform blur. Unlike the aboveprevious method, which hasproven successful only with simple deblurring scenarios, we demonstrate that our method succeeds on a variety of real-world examples. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our method and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p><p>5 0.21406126 <a title="293-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Direct_Super-Resolution_by_Simple_Functions.html">156 iccv-2013-Fast Direct Super-Resolution by Simple Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Chih-Yuan Yang, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: The goal of single-image super-resolution is to generate a high-quality high-resolution image based on a given low-resolution input. It is an ill-posed problem which requires exemplars or priors to better reconstruct the missing high-resolution image details. In this paper, we propose to split the feature space into numerous subspaces and collect exemplars to learn priors for each subspace, thereby creating effective mapping functions. The use of split input space facilitates both feasibility of using simple functionsfor super-resolution, and efficiency ofgenerating highresolution results. High-quality high-resolution images are reconstructed based on the effective learned priors. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed algorithmperforms efficiently and effectively over state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.21310124 <a title="293-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Forward_Motion_Deblurring.html">174 iccv-2013-Forward Motion Deblurring</a></p>

In particular, we show that recurrence of small patches across scales of the low-res image (which forms the basis for single-image SR), can also be used for estimating the optimal blur kernel. This leads to significant improvement in SR results.</p><p>2 0.65310323 <a title="293-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Depth_from_Combining_Defocus_and_Correspondence_Using_Light-Field_Cameras.html">108 iccv-2013-Depth from Combining Defocus and Correspondence Using Light-Field Cameras</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael W. Tao, Sunil Hadap, Jitendra Malik, Ravi Ramamoorthi</p><p>Abstract: Light-field cameras have recently become available to the consumer market. An array of micro-lenses captures enough information that one can refocus images after acquisition, as well as shift one ’s viewpoint within the subapertures of the main lens, effectively obtaining multiple views. Thus, depth cues from both defocus and correspondence are available simultaneously in a single capture. Previously, defocus could be achieved only through multiple image exposures focused at different depths, while correspondence cues needed multiple exposures at different viewpoints or multiple cameras; moreover, both cues could not easily be obtained together. In this paper, we present a novel simple and principled algorithm that computes dense depth estimation by combining both defocus and correspondence depth cues. We analyze the x-u 2D epipolar image (EPI), where by convention we assume the spatial x coordinate is horizontal and the angular u coordinate is vertical (our final algorithm uses the full 4D EPI). We show that defocus depth cues are obtained by computing the horizontal (spatial) variance after vertical (angular) integration, and correspondence depth cues by computing the vertical (angular) variance. We then show how to combine the two cues into a high quality depth map, suitable for computer vision applications such as matting, full control of depth-of-field, and surface reconstruction.</p><p>3 0.64935476 <a title="293-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-3D_Sub-query_Expansion_for_Improving_Sketch-Based_Multi-view_Image_Retrieval.html">3 iccv-2013-3D Sub-query Expansion for Improving Sketch-Based Multi-view Image Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Yen-Liang Lin, Cheng-Yu Huang, Hao-Jeng Wang, Winston Hsu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a 3D sub-query expansion approach for boosting sketch-based multi-view image retrieval. The core idea of our method is to automatically convert two (guided) 2D sketches into an approximated 3D sketch model, and then generate multi-view sketches as expanded sub-queries to improve the retrieval performance. To learn the weights among synthesized views (sub-queries), we present a new multi-query feature to model the similarity between subqueries and dataset images, and formulate it into a convex optimization problem. Our approach shows superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approach on a public multi-view image dataset. Moreover, we also conduct sensitivity tests to analyze the parameters of our approach based on the gathered user sketches.</p><p>4 0.64512342 <a title="293-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Cosegmentation_and_Cosketch_by_Unsupervised_Learning.html">95 iccv-2013-Cosegmentation and Cosketch by Unsupervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jifeng Dai, Ying Nian Wu, Jie Zhou, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Cosegmentation refers to theproblem ofsegmenting multiple images simultaneously by exploiting the similarities between the foreground and background regions in these images. The key issue in cosegmentation is to align common objects between these images. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised learning framework for cosegmentation, by coupling cosegmentation with what we call “cosketch ”. The goal of cosketch is to automatically discover a codebook of deformable shape templates shared by the input images. These shape templates capture distinct image patterns and each template is matched to similar image patches in different images. Thus the cosketch of the images helps to align foreground objects, thereby providing crucial information for cosegmentation. We present a statistical model whose energy function couples cosketch and cosegmentation. We then present an unsupervised learning algorithm that performs cosketch and cosegmentation by energy minimization. Experiments show that our method outperforms state of the art methods for cosegmentation on the challenging MSRC and iCoseg datasets. We also illustrate our method on a new dataset called Coseg-Rep where cosegmentation can be performed within a single image with repetitive patterns.</p><p>5 0.62714827 <a title="293-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Graph_Matching%3A_Oriented_to_Category_Modeling_from_Cluttered_Scenes.html">237 iccv-2013-Learning Graph Matching: Oriented to Category Modeling from Cluttered Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Quanshi Zhang, Xuan Song, Xiaowei Shao, Huijing Zhao, Ryosuke Shibasaki</p><p>Abstract: Although graph matching is a fundamental problem in pattern recognition, and has drawn broad interest from many fields, the problem of learning graph matching has not received much attention. In this paper, we redefine the learning ofgraph matching as a model learningproblem. In addition to conventional training of matching parameters, our approach modifies the graph structure and attributes to generate a graphical model. In this way, the model learning is oriented toward both matching and recognition performance, and can proceed in an unsupervised1 fashion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional methods for learning graph matching.</p><p>6 0.60476375 <a title="293-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic_Segmentation_without_Annotating_Segments.html">379 iccv-2013-Semantic Segmentation without Annotating Segments</a></p>

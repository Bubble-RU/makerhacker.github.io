<p>Author: Renliang Weng, Jiwen Lu, Junlin Hu, Gao Yang, Yap-Peng Tan</p><p>Abstract: Over the past two decades, a number of face recognition methods have been proposed in the literature. Most of them use holistic face images to recognize people. However, human faces are easily occluded by other objects in many real-world scenarios and we have to recognize the person of interest from his/her partial faces. In this paper, we propose a new partial face recognition approach by using feature set matching, which is able to align partial face patches to holistic gallery faces automatically and is robust to occlusions and illumination changes. Given each gallery image and probe face patch, we first detect keypoints and extract their local features. Then, we propose a Metric Learned ExtendedRobust PointMatching (MLERPM) method to discriminatively match local feature sets of a pair of gallery and probe samples. Lastly, the similarity of two faces is converted as the distance between two feature sets. Experimental results on three public face databases are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><p>3 0.20970951 <a title="261-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Coupling_Alignments_with_Recognition_for_Still-to-Video_Face_Recognition.html">97 iccv-2013-Coupling Alignments with Recognition for Still-to-Video Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiwu Huang, Xiaowei Zhao, Shiguang Shan, Ruiping Wang, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: The Still-to-Video (S2V) face recognition systems typically need to match faces in low-quality videos captured under unconstrained conditions against high quality still face images, which is very challenging because of noise, image blur, lowface resolutions, varying headpose, complex lighting, and alignment difficulty. To address the problem, one solution is to select the frames of ‘best quality ’ from videos (hereinafter called quality alignment in this paper). Meanwhile, the faces in the selected frames should also be geometrically aligned to the still faces offline well-aligned in the gallery. In this paper, we discover that the interactions among the three tasks–quality alignment, geometric alignment and face recognition–can benefit from each other, thus should be performed jointly. With this in mind, we propose a Coupling Alignments with Recognition (CAR) method to tightly couple these tasks via low-rank regularized sparse representation in a unified framework. Our method makes the three tasks promote mutually by a joint optimization in an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier routine. Extensive , experiments on two challenging S2V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods impressively.</p><p>4 0.20079654 <a title="261-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-POP%3A_Person_Re-identification_Post-rank_Optimisation.html">305 iccv-2013-POP: Person Re-identification Post-rank Optimisation</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunxiao Liu, Chen Change Loy, Shaogang Gong, Guijin Wang</p><p>Abstract: Owing to visual ambiguities and disparities, person reidentification methods inevitably produce suboptimal ranklist, which still requires exhaustive human eyeballing to identify the correct target from hundreds of different likelycandidates. Existing re-identification studies focus on improving the ranking performance, but rarely look into the critical problem of optimising the time-consuming and error-prone post-rank visual search at the user end. In this study, we present a novel one-shot Post-rank OPtimisation (POP) method, which allows a user to quickly refine their search by either “one-shot” or a couple of sparse negative selections during a re-identification process. We conduct systematic behavioural studies to understand user’s searching behaviour and show that the proposed method allows correct re-identification to converge 2.6 times faster than the conventional exhaustive search. Importantly, through extensive evaluations we demonstrate that the method is capable of achieving significant improvement over the stateof-the-art distance metric learning based ranking models, even with just “one shot” feedback optimisation, by as much as over 30% performance improvement for rank 1reidentification on the VIPeR and i-LIDS datasets.</p><p>5 0.19003348 <a title="261-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Sparse_Variation_Dictionary_Learning_for_Face_Recognition_with_a_Single_Training_Sample_per_Person.html">398 iccv-2013-Sparse Variation Dictionary Learning for Face Recognition with a Single Training Sample per Person</a></p>
<p>Author: Meng Yang, Luc Van_Gool, Lei Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Face recognition (FR) with a single training sample per person (STSPP) is a very challenging problem due to the lack of information to predict the variations in the query sample. Sparse representation based classification has shown interesting results in robust FR; however, its performance will deteriorate much for FR with STSPP. To address this issue, in this paper we learn a sparse variation dictionary from a generic training set to improve the query sample representation by STSPP. Instead of learning from the generic training set independently w.r.t. the gallery set, the proposed sparse variation dictionary learning (SVDL) method is adaptive to the gallery set by jointly learning a projection to connect the generic training set with the gallery set. The learnt sparse variation dictionary can be easily integrated into the framework of sparse representation based classification so that various variations in face images, including illumination, expression, occlusion, pose, etc., can be better handled. Experiments on the large-scale CMU Multi-PIE, FRGC and LFW databases demonstrate the promising performance of SVDL on FR with STSPP.</p><p>6 0.14929558 <a title="261-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Faces_Guided_Sparse_Many-to-One_Encoder_for_Pose-Invariant_Face_Recognition.html">335 iccv-2013-Random Faces Guided Sparse Many-to-One Encoder for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Adrien Bartoli, Daniel Pizarro, Toby Collins</p><p>Abstract: We study the uncalibrated isometric Shape-fromTemplate problem, that consists in estimating an isometric deformation from a template shape to an input image whose focal length is unknown. Our method is the first that combines the following features: solving for both the 3D deformation and the camera ’s focal length, involving only local analytical solutions (there is no numerical optimization), being robust to mismatches, handling general surfaces and running extremely fast. This was achieved through two key steps. First, an ‘uncalibrated’ 3D deformation is computed thanks to a novel piecewise weak-perspective projection model. Second, the camera’s focal length is estimated and enables upgrading the 3D deformation to metric. We use a variational framework, implemented using a smooth function basis and sampled local deformation models. The only degeneracy which we easily detect– for focal length estimation is a flat and fronto-parallel surface. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets show that our method achieves a 3D shape accuracy – slightly below state of the art methods using a precalibrated or the true focal length, and a focal length accuracy slightly below static calibration methods.</p><p>2 0.60586363 <a title="261-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Detecting_Curved_Symmetric_Parts_Using_a_Deformable_Disc_Model.html">110 iccv-2013-Detecting Curved Symmetric Parts Using a Deformable Disc Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Sie Ho Lee, Sanja Fidler, Sven Dickinson</p><p>Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful shape regularity that’s been exploited by perceptual grouping researchers in both human and computer vision to recover part structure from an image without a priori knowledge of scene content. Drawing on the concept of a medial axis, defined as the locus of centers of maximal inscribed discs that sweep out a symmetric part, we model part recovery as the search for a sequence of deformable maximal inscribed disc hypotheses generated from a multiscale superpixel segmentation, a framework proposed by [13]. However, we learn affinities between adjacent superpixels in a space that’s invariant to bending and tapering along the symmetry axis, enabling us to capture a wider class of symmetric parts. Moreover, we introduce a global cost that perceptually integrates the hypothesis space by combining a pairwise and a higher-level smoothing term, which we minimize globally using dynamic programming. The new framework is demonstrated on two datasets, and is shown to significantly outperform the baseline [13].</p><p>3 0.58245057 <a title="261-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_the_Visual_Interpretation_of_Sentences.html">246 iccv-2013-Learning the Visual Interpretation of Sentences</a></p>
<p>Author: C. Lawrence Zitnick, Devi Parikh, Lucy Vanderwende</p><p>Abstract: Sentences that describe visual scenes contain a wide variety of information pertaining to the presence of objects, their attributes and their spatial relations. In this paper we learn the visual features that correspond to semantic phrases derived from sentences. Specifically, we extract predicate tuples that contain two nouns and a relation. The relation may take several forms, such as a verb, preposition, adjective or their combination. We model a scene using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) formulation where each node corresponds to an object, and the edges to their relations. We determine the potentials of the CRF using the tuples extracted from the sentences. We generate novel scenes depicting the sentences’ visual meaning by sampling from the CRF. The CRF is also used to score a set of scenes for a text-based image retrieval task. Our results show we can generate (retrieve) scenes that convey the desired semantic meaning, even when scenes (queries) are described by multiple sentences. Significant improvement is found over several baseline approaches.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.54743057 <a title="261-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Markov_Network-Based_Unified_Classifier_for_Face_Identification.html">261 iccv-2013-Markov Network-Based Unified Classifier for Face Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Wonjun Hwang, Kyungshik Roh, Junmo Kim</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel unifying framework using a Markov network to learn the relationship between multiple classifiers in face recognition. We assume that we have several complementary classifiers and assign observation nodes to the features of a query image and hidden nodes to the features of gallery images. We connect each hidden node to its corresponding observation node and to the hidden nodes of other neighboring classifiers. For each observation-hidden node pair, we collect a set of gallery candidates that are most similar to the observation instance, and the relationship between the hidden nodes is captured in terms of the similarity matrix between the collected gallery images. Posterior probabilities in the hidden nodes are computed by the belief-propagation algorithm. The novelty of the proposed framework is the method that takes into account the classifier dependency using the results of each neighboring classifier. We present extensive results on two different evaluation protocols, known and unknown image variation tests, using three different databases, which shows that the proposed framework always leads to good accuracy in face recognition.</p><p>5 0.53883547 <a title="261-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Large-Scale_Multi-resolution_Surface_Reconstruction_from_RGB-D_Sequences.html">228 iccv-2013-Large-Scale Multi-resolution Surface Reconstruction from RGB-D Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Steinbrücker, Christian Kerl, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to generate highly detailed, textured 3D models of large environments from RGB-D sequences. Our system runs in real-time on a standard desktop PC with a state-of-the-art graphics card. To reduce the memory consumption, we fuse the acquired depth maps and colors in a multi-scale octree representation of a signed distance function. To estimate the camera poses, we construct a pose graph and use dense image alignment to determine the relative pose between pairs of frames. We add edges between nodes when we detect loop-closures and optimize the pose graph to correct for long-term drift. Our implementation is highly parallelized on graphics hardware to achieve real-time performance. More specifically, we can reconstruct, store, and continuously update a colored 3D model of an entire corridor of nine rooms at high levels of detail in real-time on a single GPU with 2.5GB.</p><p>6 0.53239429 <a title="261-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Handling_Uncertain_Tags_in_Visual_Recognition.html">191 iccv-2013-Handling Uncertain Tags in Visual Recognition</a></p>

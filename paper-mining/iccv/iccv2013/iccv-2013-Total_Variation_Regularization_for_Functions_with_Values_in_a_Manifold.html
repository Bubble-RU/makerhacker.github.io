<h1>421 iccv-2013-Total Variation Regularization for Functions with Values in a Manifold</h1>

In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to solve such problems which applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. The key idea is to reformulate the variational problem as a multilabel optimization problem with an infinite number of labels. This leads to a hard optimization problem which can be approximately solved using convex relaxation techniques. The framework can be easily adapted to different manifolds including spheres and three-dimensional rotations, and allows to obtain accurate solutions even with a relatively coarse discretization. With numerous examples we demonstrate that the proposed framework can be applied to variational models that incorporate chromaticity values, normal fields, or camera trajectories.</p><p>Reference: <a title="iccv-2013-421-reference" href="../iccv2013_reference/iccv-2013-Total_Variation_Regularization_for_Functions_with_Values_in_a_Manifold_reference.html">text</a></p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 The key idea is to reformulate the variational problem as a multilabel optimization problem with an infinite number of labels.

</p><p>5 dx,  (1)  plays a central role in variational image processing because of its numerous favorable properties: it preserves discontinuities, as a sharp transition from 0 to 1has the same cost as a smooth monotone transition. [sent-16, score-0.177]
</p><p>6 In many applications of computer vision, however, the functions of interest take on values which do not lie in a Euclidean space such as Rl, but rather on a manifold see Figure 1. [sent-19, score-0.393]
</p><p>7 We propose an algorithm for total variation (TV)-regularization of functions with values on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. [sent-22, score-0.296]
</p><p>8 The key idea is to represent the manifold by a set of grid points (labels) and to solve a convex optimization problem that admits sub-label accuracy: in the above example, the blue points may lie between grid-points. [sent-26, score-0.535]
</p><p>9 Processing the normal field of a geometric structure, such as a surface or three-dimensional shape, leads to variational problems in terms of functions that assume values on the two-dimensional sphere S2. [sent-28, score-0.529]
</p><p>10 While the latter can usually be dealt with by a suitable modification of the differential operators, constraining the range of u to a manifold is generally a nonconvex constraint, which makes optimization much harder. [sent-30, score-0.257]
</p><p>11 Another major challenge in extending the concept of total variation to such manifold-valued data is that we need to assure algorithmically that discontinuities in the values are properly handled. [sent-31, score-0.262]
</p><p>12 In particular, jumps in the values should be measured with respect to the geodesic distance on that manifold. [sent-32, score-0.211]
</p><p>13 For general manifolds the estimation of the geodesic distance itself may also be a challenging computational problem. [sent-33, score-0.219]
</p><p>14 Related Work Giaquinta and Mucci [8, 9] studied the notion of total variation for functions u : Ω → M with values in general vmaarniaitfiooldns f oMr f. [sent-36, score-0.296]

</p><p>16 The authors theoretically  u+  study the functions with bounded total variation and prove several properties such as lower-semicontinuity and structure theorems. [sent-43, score-0.287]
</p><p>17 However, they do not provide an algorithm for implementing this regularizer in a variational setting. [sent-44, score-0.185]
</p><p>18 In fact, their theoretical analysis is based on an embedding of the given manifold M in a higher-dimensional Eudcilindgea onf space vwenhic mha nisi fionlfdea Msib lien tao implement: Firstly, Ethuehigher-dimensional embedding space increases the computational complexity.

</p><p>26 A straightforward approach to apply this idea to manifolds is to choose a finite set of points z1, . [sent-89, score-0.28]
</p><p>27 as two major drawbacks: Firstly, it generally requires a quadratic number of constraints, which severely restricts the resolution with which the manifold can be discretized. [sent-98, score-0.257]
</p><p>28 Together,  these features  ensure that the minimization  problem is computationally  feasible, and allow to obtain  accurate solutions with values on the manifold that are not restricted to a finite set. [sent-115, score-0.422]

</p><p>55 Another possible way is to replace the spectral norm by the Frobenius norm, in which case (19)–(20) becomes a standard second-order cone program (SOCP). [sent-374, score-0.14]

<p>Author: Hongteng Xu, Hongyuan Zha</p><p>Abstract: Data sparsity has been a thorny issuefor manifold-based image synthesis, and in this paper we address this critical problem by leveraging ideas from transfer learning. Specifically, we propose methods based on generating auxiliary data in the form of synthetic samples using transformations of the original sparse samples. To incorporate the auxiliary data, we propose a weighted data synthesis method, which adaptively selects from the generated samples for inclusion during the manifold learning process via a weighted iterative algorithm. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we apply it to the problem of face image synthesis from sparse samples. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method shows encouraging results with good performance improvements.</p><p>3 0.15705416 <a title="421-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Framework_for_Shape_Analysis_via_Hilbert_Space_Embedding.html">10 iccv-2013-A Framework for Shape Analysis via Hilbert Space Embedding</a></p>
<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for 2D shape analysis using positive definite kernels defined on Kendall’s shape manifold. Different representations of 2D shapes are known to generate different nonlinear spaces. Due to the nonlinearity of these spaces, most existing shape classification algorithms resort to nearest neighbor methods and to learning distances on shape spaces. Here, we propose to map shapes on Kendall’s shape manifold to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To this end, we introduce a kernel on this manifold that permits such a mapping, and prove its positive definiteness. This kernel lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM, MKL and kernel PCA, to the shape manifold. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods on shape classification, clustering and retrieval.</p><p>4 0.14247285 <a title="421-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Curvature-Aware_Regularization_on_Riemannian_Submanifolds.html">100 iccv-2013-Curvature-Aware Regularization on Riemannian Submanifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Kwang In Kim, James Tompkin, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: One fundamental assumption in object recognition as well as in other computer vision and pattern recognition problems is that the data generation process lies on a manifold and that it respects the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. This assumption is held in several successful algorithms for diffusion and regularization, in particular, in graph-Laplacian-based algorithms. We claim that the performance of existing algorithms can be improved if we additionally account for how the manifold is embedded within the ambient space, i.e., if we consider the extrinsic geometry of the manifold. We present a procedure for characterizing the extrinsic (as well as intrinsic) curvature of a manifold M which is described by a sampled point cloud in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Once estimated, we use this characterization in general diffusion and regularization on M, and form a new regularizer on a point cloud. The resulting re-weighted graph Laplacian demonstrates superior performance over classical graph Laplacian in semisupervised learning and spectral clustering.</p><p>5 0.12268245 <a title="421-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Motion_Segmentation_Using_Dynamic_Label_Propagation.html">297 iccv-2013-Online Motion Segmentation Using Dynamic Label Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Elqursh, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: The vast majority of work on motion segmentation adopts the affine camera model due to its simplicity. Under the affine model, the motion segmentation problem becomes that of subspace separation. Due to this assumption, such methods are mainly offline and exhibit poor performance when the assumption is not satisfied. This is made evident in state-of-the-art methods that relax this assumption by using piecewise affine spaces and spectral clustering techniques to achieve better results. In this paper, we formulate the problem of motion segmentation as that of manifold separation. We then show how label propagation can be used in an online framework to achieve manifold separation. The performance of our framework is evaluated on a benchmark dataset and achieves competitive performance while being online.</p><p>6 0.11993401 <a title="421-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_General_Dense_Image_Matching_Framework_Combining_Direct_and_Feature-Based_Costs.html">12 iccv-2013-A General Dense Image Matching Framework Combining Direct and Feature-Based Costs</a></p>

<p>Author: Qiegen Liu, Jianbo Liu, Pei Dong, Dong Liang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel structure gradient and texture decorrelating regularization (SGTD) for image decomposition. The motivation of the idea is under the assumption that the structure gradient and texture components should be properly decorrelated for a successful decomposition. The proposed model consists of the data fidelity term, total variation regularization and the SGTD regularization. An augmented Lagrangian method is proposed to address this optimization issue, by first transforming the unconstrained problem to an equivalent constrained problem and then applying an alternating direction method to iteratively solve the subproblems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method presents better or comparable performance as state-of-the-art methods do.</p><p>5 0.62580603 <a title="421-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Perceptual_Fidelity_Aware_Mean_Squared_Error.html">312 iccv-2013-Perceptual Fidelity Aware Mean Squared Error</a></p>
<p>Author: Wufeng Xue, Xuanqin Mou, Lei Zhang, Xiangchu Feng</p><p>Abstract: How to measure the perceptual quality of natural images is an important problem in low level vision. It is known that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is not an effective index to describe the perceptual fidelity of images. Numerous perceptual fidelity indices have been developed, while the representatives include the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index and its variants. However, most of those perceptual measures are nonlinear, and they cannot be easily adopted as an objective function to minimize in various low level vision tasks. Can MSE be perceptual fidelity aware after some minor adaptation ? In this paper we propose a simple framework to enhance the perceptual fidelity awareness of MSE by introducing an l2-norm structural error term to it. Such a Structural MSE (SMSE) can lead to very competitive image quality assessment (IQA) results. More surprisingly, we show that by using certain structure extractors, SMSE can befurther turned into a Gaussian smoothed MSE (i.e., the Euclidean distance between the original and distorted images after Gaussian , smooth filtering), which is much simpler to calculate but achieves rather better IQA performance than SSIM. The socalled Perceptual-fidelity Aware MSE (PAMSE) can have great potentials in applications such as perceptual image coding and perceptual image restoration.</p><p>6 0.60756451 <a title="421-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Parallel_Transport_of_Deformations_in_Shape_Space_of_Elastic_Surfaces.html">307 iccv-2013-Parallel Transport of Deformations in Shape Space of Elastic Surfaces</a></p>

<p>Author: Ying Fu, Antony Lam, Imari Sato, Takahiro Okabe, Yoichi Sato</p><p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging is beneficial to many applications but current methods do not consider fluorescent effects which are present in everyday items ranging from paper, to clothing, to even our food. Furthermore, everyday fluorescent items exhibit a mix of reflectance and fluorescence. So proper separation of these components is necessary for analyzing them. In this paper, we demonstrate efficient separation and recovery of reflective and fluorescent emission spectra through the use of high frequency illumination in the spectral domain. With the obtained fluorescent emission spectra from our high frequency illuminants, we then present to our knowledge, the first method for estimating the fluorescent absorption spectrum of a material given its emission spectrum. Conventional bispectral measurement of absorption and emission spectra needs to examine all combinations of incident and observed light wavelengths. In contrast, our method requires only two hyperspectral images. The effectiveness of our proposed methods are then evaluated through a combination of simulation and real experiments. We also demonstrate an application of our method to synthetic relighting of real scenes.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.79008317 <a title="421-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Total_Variation_Regularization_for_Functions_with_Values_in_a_Manifold.html">421 iccv-2013-Total Variation Regularization for Functions with Values in a Manifold</a></p>

<p>Author: Stefan Duffner, Christophe Garcia</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for fast tracking of generic objects in videos. The algorithm uses two components: a detector that makes use of the generalised Hough transform with pixel-based descriptors, and a probabilistic segmentation method based on global models for foreground and background. These components are used for tracking in a combined way, and they adapt each other in a co-training manner. Through effective model adaptation and segmentation, the algorithm is able to track objects that undergo rigid and non-rigid deformations and considerable shape and appearance variations. The proposed tracking method has been thoroughly evaluated on challenging standard videos, and outperforms state-of-theart tracking methods designed for the same task. Finally, the proposed models allow for an extremely efficient implementation, and thus tracking is very fast.</p><p>4 0.6307323 <a title="421-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_3D_Scene_Labeling_Using_Fields_of_Trees.html">132 iccv-2013-Efficient 3D Scene Labeling Using Fields of Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Olaf Kähler, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of 3D scene labeling in a structured learning framework. Unlike previous work which uses structured Support VectorMachines, we employ the recently described Decision Tree Field and Regression Tree Field frameworks, which learn the unary and binary terms of a Conditional Random Field from training data. We show this has significant advantages in terms of inference speed, while maintaining similar accuracy. We also demonstrate empirically the importance for overall labeling accuracy of features that make use of prior knowledge about the coarse scene layout such as the location of the ground plane. We show how this coarse layout can be estimated by our framework automatically, and that this information can be used to bootstrap improved accuracy in the detailed labeling.</p><p>5 0.62705916 <a title="421-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Visual_Reranking_through_Weakly_Supervised_Multi-graph_Learning.html">445 iccv-2013-Visual Reranking through Weakly Supervised Multi-graph Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Cheng Deng, Rongrong Ji, Wei Liu, Dacheng Tao, Xinbo Gao</p><p>Abstract: Visual reranking has been widely deployed to refine the quality of conventional content-based image retrieval engines. The current trend lies in employing a crowd of retrieved results stemming from multiple feature modalities to boost the overall performance of visual reranking. However, a major challenge pertaining to current reranking methods is how to take full advantage of the complementary property of distinct feature modalities. Given a query image and one feature modality, a regular visual reranking framework treats the top-ranked images as pseudo positive instances which are inevitably noisy, difficult to reveal this complementary property, and thus lead to inferior ranking performance. This paper proposes a novel image reranking approach by introducing a Co-Regularized Multi-Graph Learning (Co-RMGL) framework, in which the intra-graph and inter-graph constraints are simultaneously imposed to encode affinities in a single graph and consistency across different graphs. Moreover, weakly supervised learning driven by image attributes is performed to denoise the pseudo- labeled instances, thereby highlighting the unique strength of individual feature modality. Meanwhile, such learning can yield a few anchors in graphs that vitally enable the alignment and fusion of multiple graphs. As a result, an edge weight matrix learned from the fused graph automatically gives the ordering to the initially retrieved results.

<p>Author: Mehrtash Harandi, Conrad Sanderson, Chunhua Shen, Brian Lovell</p><p>Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning suggest that a wide range of problems can be addressed more appropriately by considering non-Euclidean geometry. In this paper we explore sparse dictionary learning over the space of linear subspaces, which form Riemannian structures known as Grassmann manifolds. To this end, we propose to embed Grassmann manifolds into the space of symmetric matrices by an isometric mapping, which enables us to devise a closed-form solution for updating a Grassmann dictionary, atom by atom. Furthermore, to handle non-linearity in data, we propose a kernelised version of the dictionary learning algorithm. Experiments on several classification tasks (face recognition, action recognition, dynamic texture classification) show that the proposed approach achieves considerable improvements in discrimination accuracy, in comparison to state-of-the-art methods such as kernelised Affine Hull Method and graphembedding Grassmann discriminant analysis.</p><p>3 0.23257492 <a title="421-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Manifold_Based_Face_Synthesis_from_Sparse_Samples.html">259 iccv-2013-Manifold Based Face Synthesis from Sparse Samples</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongteng Xu, Hongyuan Zha</p><p>Abstract: Data sparsity has been a thorny issuefor manifold-based image synthesis, and in this paper we address this critical problem by leveraging ideas from transfer learning. Specifically, we propose methods based on generating auxiliary data in the form of synthetic samples using transformations of the original sparse samples. To incorporate the auxiliary data, we propose a weighted data synthesis method, which adaptively selects from the generated samples for inclusion during the manifold learning process via a weighted iterative algorithm. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we apply it to the problem of face image synthesis from sparse samples. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method shows encouraging results with good performance improvements.</p><p>4 0.19317591 <a title="421-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_Framework_for_Shape_Analysis_via_Hilbert_Space_Embedding.html">10 iccv-2013-A Framework for Shape Analysis via Hilbert Space Embedding</a></p>
<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for 2D shape analysis using positive definite kernels defined on Kendall’s shape manifold. Different representations of 2D shapes are known to generate different nonlinear spaces. Due to the nonlinearity of these spaces, most existing shape classification algorithms resort to nearest neighbor methods and to learning distances on shape spaces. Here, we propose to map shapes on Kendall’s shape manifold to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To this end, we introduce a kernel on this manifold that permits such a mapping, and prove its positive definiteness. This kernel lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM, MKL and kernel PCA, to the shape manifold. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods on shape classification, clustering and retrieval.</p><p>5 0.17022738 <a title="421-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_New_Image_Quality_Metric_for_Image_Auto-denoising.html">23 iccv-2013-A New Image Quality Metric for Image Auto-denoising</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiangfei Kong, Kuan Li, Qingxiong Yang, Liu Wenyin, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new non-reference image quality metric that can be adopted by the state-of-the-art image/video denoising algorithms for auto-denoising. The proposed metric is extremely simple and can be implemented in four lines of Matlab code1. The basic assumption employed by the proposed metric is that the noise should be independent of the original image. A direct measurement of this dependence is, however, impractical due to the relatively low accuracy of existing denoising method. The proposed metric thus aims at maximizing the structure similarity between the input noisy image and the estimated image noise around homogeneous regions and the structure similarity between the input noisy image and the denoised image around highly-structured regions, and is computed as the linear correlation coefficient of the two corresponding structure similarity maps. Numerous experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric not only outperforms the current state-of-the-art non-reference quality metric quantitatively and qualitatively, but also better maintains temporal coherence when used for video denoising. ˜</p><p>6 0.16781017 <a title="421-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Motion_Segmentation_Using_Dynamic_Label_Propagation.html">297 iccv-2013-Online Motion Segmentation Using Dynamic Label Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kwang In Kim, James Tompkin, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: One fundamental assumption in object recognition as well as in other computer vision and pattern recognition problems is that the data generation process lies on a manifold and that it respects the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. This assumption is held in several successful algorithms for diffusion and regularization, in particular, in graph-Laplacian-based algorithms. We claim that the performance of existing algorithms can be improved if we additionally account for how the manifold is embedded within the ambient space, i.e., if we consider the extrinsic geometry of the manifold. We present a procedure for characterizing the extrinsic (as well as intrinsic) curvature of a manifold M which is described by a sampled point cloud in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Once estimated, we use this characterization in general diffusion and regularization on M, and form a new regularizer on a point cloud. The resulting re-weighted graph Laplacian demonstrates superior performance over classical graph Laplacian in semisupervised learning and spectral clustering.</p><p>5 0.55311352 <a title="421-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_New_Image_Quality_Metric_for_Image_Auto-denoising.html">23 iccv-2013-A New Image Quality Metric for Image Auto-denoising</a></p>

<p>Author: Kyle Wilson, Noah Snavely</p><p>Abstract: Repeated features are common in urban scenes. Many objects, such as clock towers with nearly identical sides, or domes with strong radial symmetries, pose challenges for structure from motion. When similar but distinct features are mistakenly equated, the resulting 3D reconstructions can have errors ranging from phantom walls and superimposed structures to a complete failure to reconstruct. We present a new approach to solving such problems by considering the local visibility structure of such repeated features. Drawing upon network theory, we present a new way of scoring features using a measure of local clustering. Our model leads to a simple, fast, and highly scalable technique for disambiguating repeated features based on an analysis of an underlying visibility graph, without relying on explicit geometric reasoning. We demonstrate our method on several very large datasets drawn from Internet photo collections, and compare it to a more traditional geometry-based disambiguation technique.</p><p>3 0.55643553 <a title="421-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Similarity_Metric_Learning_for_Face_Recognition.html">392 iccv-2013-Similarity Metric Learning for Face Recognition</a></p>

In this paper, we develop a novel regularization framework to learn similarity metrics for unconstrained face verification. We formulate its objective function by incorporating the robustness to the large intra-personal variations and the discriminative power of novel similarity metrics. In addition, our formulation is a convex optimization problem which guarantees the existence of its global solution. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on the challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) database [10].</p><p>4 0.52273685 <a title="421-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-EVSAC%3A_Accelerating_Hypotheses_Generation_by_Modeling_Matching_Scores_with_Extreme_Value_Theory.html">131 iccv-2013-EVSAC: Accelerating Hypotheses Generation by Modeling Matching Scores with Extreme Value Theory</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Fragoso, Pradeep Sen, Sergio Rodriguez, Matthew Turk</p><p>Abstract: Algorithms based on RANSAC that estimate models usingfeature correspondences between images can slow down tremendously when the percentage of correct correspondences (inliers) is small. In this paper, we present a probabilistic parametric model that allows us to assign confidence values for each matching correspondence and therefore accelerates the generation of hypothesis models for RANSAC under these conditions. Our framework leverages Extreme Value Theory to accurately model the statistics of matching scores produced by a nearest-neighbor feature matcher. Using a new algorithm based on this model, we are able to estimate accurate hypotheses with RANSAC at low inlier ratios significantly faster than previous stateof-the-art approaches, while still performing comparably when the number ofinliers is large. Wepresent results ofhomography and fundamental matrix estimation experiments for both SIFT and SURF matches that demonstrate that our method leads to accurate and fast model estimations.</p><p>5 0.50385308 <a title="421-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Co-segmentation_via_Consistent_Functional_Maps.html">208 iccv-2013-Image Co-segmentation via Consistent Functional Maps</a></p>
<p>Author: Fan Wang, Qixing Huang, Leonidas J. Guibas</p><p>Abstract: Joint segmentation of image sets has great importance for object recognition, image classification, and image retrieval. In this paper, we aim to jointly segment a set of images starting from a small number of labeled images or none at all. To allow the images to share segmentation information with each other, we build a network that contains segmented as well as unsegmented images, and extract functional maps between connected image pairs based on image appearance features. These functional maps act as general property transporters between the images and, in particular, are used to transfer segmentations. We define and operate in a reduced functional space optimized so that the functional maps approximately satisfy cycle-consistency under composition in the network. A joint optimization framework is proposed to simultaneously generate all segmentation functions over the images so that they both align with local segmentation cues in each particular image, and agree with each other under network transportation. This formulation allows us to extract segmentations even with no training data, but can also exploit such data when available. The collective effect of the joint processing using functional maps leads to accurate information sharing among images and yields superior segmentation results, as shown on the iCoseg, MSRC, and PASCAL data sets.</p><p>6 0.491575 <a title="421-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Domain_Adaptive_Classification.html">123 iccv-2013-Domain Adaptive Classification</a></p>

</p><p>7 Introduction The success of recognition methods based on visual descriptors and off-the-shelf machine learning techniques [27, 6] is one of the main reasons for the new enthusiasm in computer vision technologies. [sent-11, score-0.257]
</p><p>8 These methods have shown robustness against visual complexities, such as changes in illumination, scale, affine distortions, and mild intraclass Acknowledgment: This work was partially funded by FONDECYT grant 1120720 and NSF grant 11-1218709. [sent-12, score-0.146]
</p><p>9 BoVW models build a mid-level representation that cor-  responds to the output of a pooling scheme acting on a visual dictionary that encodes appearance information from local image patches. [sent-17, score-0.877]
</p><p>10 Afterwards, several variations have been proposed using alternative quantization methods, discriminative dictionaries, or different pooling strategies [12, 14, 30, 20]. [sent-19, score-0.373]
</p><p>11 Recently, sparse coding schemes have emerged as a powerful alternative to vector quantization providing dictionaries that achieve lower reconstruction errors and attractive computational properties. [sent-21, score-0.445]
</p><p>12 In particular, [3 1] shows that a combination of sparse coding, spatial pyramidal decomposition, max-polling, and high dimensional linear SVM classifiers provide a powerful scheme to perform object and scene recognition. [sent-22, score-0.428]
</p><p>13 Discriminative sparse representations have also been proposed [19, 4], mostly building particular dictionaries for each class. [sent-23, score-0.165]
</p><p>14 In the case of part-based models, the mid-level representation corresponds to basic semantic visual structures that can usually be mapped to relevant object components. [sent-24, score-0.214]
</p><p>15 Common strategies to obtain these parts are manual selection [7], greedy latent models [8], or the output of a large set of part-based classifiers trained using a costly labeling process [3]. [sent-25, score-0.23]
</p><p>16 After the seminal work in [8], latent models have 11669977  been used to jointly learn parts and object classifiers under a common optimization scheme that maximizes object classification performance. [sent-27, score-0.371]
</p><p>17 Recently, [29] proposes an extension to [8] that directly considers the multiclass classification case, but in the context of an action recognition application. [sent-28, score-0.212]
</p><p>18 In both cases, BoVW and part-based models, the final recognition is generally based on a classifier that is trained on top of the mid-level representation usually augmented with spatial information. [sent-29, score-0.164]
</p><p>19 As a common fact, most of these models do not consider the multiclass classification problem directly, [29] being a notable exception. [sent-30, score-0.175]
</p><p>20 As an alternative, most methods achieve multiclass classification by using variations of the binary classification case, for example, using a one-versus-all classification strategy. [sent-31, score-0.301]
</p><p>21 In contrast, we embed semantic knowledge to our model by explicitly exploiting compositional relations among low level visual features, visual words, and high label classifiers. [sent-37, score-0.298]
</p><p>22 We believe that it is still not clear what is the most suitable level of abstraction to implement intermediate level representations. [sent-40, score-0.236]
</p><p>23 In these cases, the redundancy and greater flexibility offered by the statistical properties of BoWs, based on a suitable dictionary of visual words, represent an attractive alternative or complement to part-based approaches. [sent-42, score-0.769]
</p><p>24 In this work we present a novel hierarchical approach to visual recognition that jointly learns a suitable mid-level representation together with top-level classifiers using a multiclass max-margin approach. [sent-43, score-0.574]
</p><p>25 We formulate our prob-  lem as an energy minimization problem, where structural hierarchical relations are modeled by sub-energy terms acting at different levels of abstraction. [sent-44, score-0.279]
</p><p>26 In terms of dictionary construction, we depart from the usual vector quantization [24] or sparse coding schemes [3 1] commonly used in BoVW models, and similarly to [8], we use linear SVMs classifiers to characterize each word ofthe dictionary underlying the BoVW representation. [sent-45, score-1.418]
</p><p>27 Furthermore, we complement the dictionary construction with a max-pooling strategy, because it shows superior performance than alternative techniques, as suggested in [3 1] and [4]. [sent-46, score-0.575]
</p><p>28 More importantly, by coupling learning of a mid-level dictionary and top-level classifiers, we are able to obtain a mid-level representation that fosters word sharing among target classes. [sent-47, score-0.733]
</p><p>29 As shown by our experiments, this allows us to achieve state-of-theart recognition performance in several common benchmarks datasets, using an order of magnitude less words than previous approaches. [sent-48, score-0.204]
</p><p>30 We believe that this is a critical issue to the scalability of visual recognition algorithms. [sent-49, score-0.133]
</p><p>31 In particular, high level semantic information at the level of object or scene class labels can be propagated to guide the otherwise unsupervised search for relevant visual words at the level of image patches. [sent-51, score-0.482]
</p><p>32 We believe that this is a powerful learning scheme that can be extended to further levels of abstraction providing a rich hypothesis space to build visual compositional  schemes [2]. [sent-52, score-0.427]
</p><p>33 Consequently, this work makes two main contributions: •  •  Introduce a hierarchical method that jointly learns suitIanbtlreo dBuocVeaW h meriadr-clheivceall representations alnyd le top-level classifiers using a multiclass max-margin framework. [sent-53, score-0.399]
</p><p>34 Demonstrate that by coupling learning of a mid-level dictionary taen dth top le coveulp lcinlagss leifiaerrnsi,n we are iadb-llee etol achieve state-of-the-art results with a significant reduction in dictionary size respect to previous approaches. [sent-54, score-1.023]
</p><p>35 In this work, the authors achieve excellent results in image classification by combining a linear spatial pyramid matching (SPM) kernel based on sparse coding (ScSPM) with linear SVMs. [sent-58, score-0.302]
</p><p>36 Their key insights are to use sparse dictionary learning techniques to construct the dictionary (as opposed to k-means), and to use max pooling to construct the descriptors over a spatial pyramid (as opposed to average pooling, which leads to histograms). [sent-59, score-1.379]
</p><p>37 An important disadvantage of [3 1] is that the dictionary of visual features is learned independently from the classification parameters for the different object categories. [sent-60, score-0.619]
</p><p>38 In this 11669988  work, we propose an approach in which the visual dictio-  nary is learned jointly with the top level visual classifiers. [sent-61, score-0.291]
</p><p>39 Image Representation As in [3 1], we assume that visual descriptors [18, 1] are extracted from images, either centered at interest points or by using a dense sampling scheme, and that each of these descriptors has size T. [sent-64, score-0.252]
</p><p>40 Inspired by [10], we define a visual dictionary Θ of K words, Θ = [θ1 θ2 θ3 . [sent-65, score-0.556]
</p><p>41 (2)  Unlike [3 1], instead of using sparse coding to encode each descriptor, we use an encoding scheme based on the classification score obtained by each dictionary word. [sent-72, score-0.722]
</p><p>42 More specifically, if v is a descriptor vector, its coding cΘ (v) using dictionary Θ is given by: cΘ(v) = [? [sent-73, score-0.636]
</p><p>43 (3)  Intuitively, if the visual words are sufficiently discriminative, the descriptor v should be similar only to a few words in the dictionary. [sent-81, score-0.505]
</p><p>44 Given a dictionary Θ and a set of L rectangular regions defined over an image, we represent the image using max spatial pooling. [sent-83, score-0.618]
</p><p>45 Generally, these regions are defined us-  ing a spatial pyramidal decomposition. [sent-84, score-0.234]
</p><p>46 , L, let vjl be a descriptor vector extracted from region l, where j ∈ [1. [sent-89, score-0.262]
</p><p>47 Nl] indexes the Nl descriptors erexgtrioacnte ld, wfrhoemre region 1l. [sent-92, score-0.123]
</p><p>48 ThNus, given a dictionary Θ, we encode region lusing max spatial pooling as: xl,Θ  = [jm∈aNxl? [sent-95, score-0.758]
</p><p>49 (4)  Notice that, unlike the sparse coding scheme, which assigns zero weights to dictionary words that do not contribute to image reconstruction, our scheme assigns negative weights to dictionary words with low similarity. [sent-103, score-1.529]
</p><p>50 To avoid this, we assume that each region contains a null feature vector whose classification score is zero for any of the dictionary words. [sent-105, score-0.568]
</p><p>51 Finally, the complete descriptor of image I given dictionary Θ, xΘ (I), is obtained by concatenating the descriptors of its L regions, i. [sent-107, score-0.613]
</p><p>52 Image Classification Given a descriptor for image I, xΘ (I), we define an image classification score, or energy function, for an image I as:  E(I, y, Θ, W) = wyTxΘ(I). [sent-116, score-0.2]
</p><p>53 If wy is divided into L sub-vectors of size K, each one assigned to a different region, we can rewrite the energy in the following form: ? [sent-121, score-0.139]
</p><p>54 It can also be seen that the energy function shows a nonlinear dependence between the weights wy and the dictionary words θk. [sent-129, score-0.804]
</p><p>55 Given the parameters of the classifiers for the different object categories, W, and the parameters of the classifiers for the different visual words, Θ, we classify an image I follows as  y∗ = argmyaxE(I,y,Θ,W). [sent-130, score-0.328]
</p><p>56 Learning  (9)  The model described in the previous section depends on two sets of parameters: the object classifiers W and the visual words classifiers Θ. [sent-132, score-0.495]
</p><p>57 Rather than first learning the visual words and then learning the object classifiers, our goal is to learn both of them simultaneously, so that the visual words are discriminative for the visual classification task. [sent-133, score-0.827]
</p><p>58 −  (10) −  ξi,  The objective function encourages the construction of visual words that behave like linear SVMs, i. [sent-148, score-0.263]
</p><p>59 , classifiers 11669999  that jointly maximize the margin and minimize the loss. [sent-150, score-0.171]
</p><p>60 To tackle this issue, we can solve a relaxed version of the previous problem using latent variables to avoid the nonlinearity. [sent-157, score-0.119]
</p><p>61 If we recall, the descriptor of a region l is given by Eq. [sent-158, score-0.12]
</p><p>62 We modify this expression by removing the max operator and adding a set of latent variables z = {z(l,k) }, foopre lr ∈to {r1 a,n . [sent-160, score-0.161]
</p><p>63 ](T12,) where z(l,k) is the index of the descriptor extracted from region lwith maximum response, when θk is applied to it, i. [sent-175, score-0.12]
</p><p>64 According to the CCCP algorithm [33] used to solve the LS-SVM, if the problem can be factored as a sum of a convex and a concave term, it can be efficiently solved by iterating between the optimization of the concave and the convex parts leading to a local minimum or saddle point. [sent-216, score-0.141]
</p><p>65 Given fixed values of Θ and W, compute for each example the optimum value for its latent variables zi as:  = argmax? [sent-245, score-0.194]
</p><p>66 (18) shows that the descriptor vector selected for a region land dictionary word θk depends directly on the values of wyi,l,k and the inner product ? [sent-255, score-0.644]
</p><p>67 As a consequence zi now only depends on Θ, thus making it unnecessary to update the latent variables after recomputing W. [sent-262, score-0.194]
</p><p>68 1  Although the convergence to a local minimum or saddle point can not be theoreticaly guaranteed for our block coordinate descent method [25], experimentally we found that for a suitable selection of the regularization parameters, our procedure does converge. [sent-307, score-0.116]
</p><p>69 We first focus on the analysis of the sensitivity of the results to the values taken by the regularization constants, C1 and C2, the size of the dictionary, K, and the number of pooling regions, L. [sent-311, score-0.155]
</p><p>70 Local descriptors are extracted from each image over a dense grid of regions of 16x16 pixels, with a spacing of 8 pixels in each direction. [sent-316, score-0.138]
</p><p>71 To construct the descriptor for each image, we randomly select L rectangular regions of sizes between 25% to 100% of the image size and low overlap. [sent-318, score-0.135]
</p><p>72 Starting dictionary We sample 75 descriptors per training image and cluster them using the standard K-Means algorithm. [sent-319, score-0.538]
</p><p>73 A linear SVM is trained for each centroid using, as positive examples, the ones belonging to that centroid and, as negative examples, a random sample of descriptors belonging to other centroids. [sent-320, score-0.154]
</p><p>74 MIT67 Indoor: This dataset contains 67 indoor scene categories having a large isnettrca o-cnlatasisn vsa 6r7iat iniodno. [sent-325, score-0.123]
</p><p>75 1  Effects of the regularization constants  Regularization constants, C1 and C2, play a significant role in keeping generalization at high levels and avoiding overfitting to training data. [sent-331, score-0.154]
</p><p>76 As for C1, we consider the fact that each word in the starting dictionary is trained independently. [sent-337, score-0.524]
</p><p>77 In this way, the resulting dictionary has a large norm compared to the 0-1 Δ function we use. [sent-338, score-0.46]
</p><p>78 2  Effects of the number pooling regions and dictionary words  We use from 10 to 60 pooling regions and average the hit rate obtained in the three datasets. [sent-346, score-1.105]
</p><p>79 Table 1 shows our results, where we also include the performance of the standard pyramidal decomposition using 3 levels (SP). [sent-348, score-0.163]
</p><p>80 Table 1 shows a consistent improvement in performance as the number of regions increases; the best performance being reached for 30 pooling regions. [sent-350, score-0.215]
</p><p>81 It is interesting to note that the performance obtained by randomly selecting regions is consistently higher than the standard pyramidal decomposition, a result also shown in [11]. [sent-351, score-0.178]
</p><p>82 The size of the dictionary (number of words) is a central issue in this research. [sent-352, score-0.46]
</p><p>83 We perform tests changing the number of dictionary words between 50 and 500 and measure the average hit rate in the three datasets. [sent-353, score-0.675]
</p><p>84 We fix the number of pooling regions to 30, as our previous experiments suggested. [sent-354, score-0.215]
</p><p>85 As it can be seen, there is a clear increase in performance when the dictionary size increases from 50 to 200 words. [sent-356, score-0.46]
</p><p>86 Near 200 words seems to be minimum size for this method to work correctly. [sent-357, score-0.167]
</p><p>87 These results confirm a key property of our method, as the increase in dictionary size is lower than linear with respect to the increase of target classes. [sent-361, score-0.46]
</p><p>88 This method is the same approach described in this paper, but without the dictionary updating step (step 3 of the algorithm description). [sent-367, score-0.46]
</p><p>89 An important aspect of our results is that they are achieved using only 200 or 300 dictionary words, while alternative methods usually use more than a thousand. [sent-369, score-0.573]
</p><p>90 Therefore, by updating the dictionary using information from the top level classifiers our method not only improves its raw performance compared to the baseline, but also achieves its peak performance using less visual words. [sent-371, score-0.716]
</p><p>91 Conclusions and Future Work In this work we present a novel method for visual recognition that uses a joint optimization scheme to learn a discriminative visual dictionary and the weights of a multiclass max-margin classifier. [sent-373, score-0.949]
</p><p>92 Another key result of our method is the generation of a common dictionary of discriminative visual words among the target visual categories. [sent-375, score-0.869]
</p><p>93 This allows us to achieve stateof-the-art performance using an order of magnitude less visual words than previous approaches. [sent-376, score-0.263]
</p><p>94 This is a relevant is-  sue that not only reduces the complexity of the underlying optimization problem, but also has an impact at testing time due to the reduced number of visual words. [sent-377, score-0.143]
</p><p>95 Future work will focus on using multiscale patches to enrich our hypothesis space to search for suitable visual words. [sent-378, score-0.159]
</p><p>96 We also plan to handle larger dictionaries to allow a suitable representation of datasets with a large number of visual categories. [sent-379, score-0.265]

<p>Author: Hans Lobel, René Vidal, Alvaro Soto</p><p>Abstract: Currently, Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) and part-based methods are the most popular approaches for visual recognition. In both cases, a mid-level representation is built on top of low-level image descriptors and top-level classifiers use this mid-level representation to achieve visual recognition. While in current part-based approaches, mid- and top-level representations are usually jointly trained, this is not the usual case for BoVW schemes. A main reason for this is the complex data association problem related to the usual large dictionary size needed by BoVW approaches. As a further observation, typical solutions based on BoVW and part-based representations are usually limited to extensions of binary classification schemes, a strategy that ignores relevant correlations among classes. In this work we propose a novel hierarchical approach to visual recognition based on a BoVW scheme that jointly learns suitable midand top-level representations. Furthermore, using a maxmargin learning framework, the proposed approach directly handles the multiclass case at both levels of abstraction. We test our proposed method using several popular bench- mark datasets. As our main result, we demonstrate that, by coupling learning of mid- and top-level representations, the proposed approach fosters sharing of discriminative visual words among target classes, being able to achieve state-ofthe-art recognition performance using far less visual words than previous approaches.</p><p>2 0.38966376 <a title="197-tfidf-2" href="./iccv-2013-Semi-supervised_Robust_Dictionary_Learning_via_Efficient_l-Norms_Minimization.html">384 iccv-2013-Semi-supervised Robust Dictionary Learning via Efficient l-Norms Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Weidong Cai, Heng Huang</p><p>Abstract: Representing the raw input of a data set by a set of relevant codes is crucial to many computer vision applications. Due to the intrinsic sparse property of real-world data, dictionary learning, in which the linear decomposition of a data point uses a set of learned dictionary bases, i.e., codes, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance.

Considering training samples with multiple attributes, a new distance matrix is proposed by jointly incorporating data and attribute similarities. Then, an objective function is presented to learn categorydependent dictionaries that are compact (closeness of dictionary atoms based on data distance and attribute similarity), reconstructive (low reconstruction error with correct dictionary) and label-consistent (encouraging the labels of dictionary atoms to be similar). We have demonstrated our algorithm on action classification and face recognition tasks on several publicly available datasets.

<p>Author: Zhuoyuan Chen, Ying Wu</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity models have recently shown great promise in many vision tasks. Using a learned dictionary in sparsity models can in general outperform predefined bases in clean data. In practice, both training and testing data may be corrupted and contain noises and outliers. Although recent studies attempted to cope with corrupted data and achieved encouraging results in testing phase, how to handle corruption in training phase still remains a very difficult problem. In contrast to most existing methods that learn the dictionaryfrom clean data, this paper is targeted at handling corruptions and outliers in training data for dictionary learning. We propose a general method to decompose the reconstructive residual into two components: a non-sparse component for small universal noises and a sparse component for large outliers, respectively. In addition, , further analysis reveals the connection between our approach and the “partial” dictionary learning approach, updating only part of the prototypes (or informative codewords) with remaining (or noisy codewords) fixed.

<p>Author: Hans Lobel, René Vidal, Alvaro Soto</p><p>Abstract: Currently, Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) and part-based methods are the most popular approaches for visual recognition. In both cases, a mid-level representation is built on top of low-level image descriptors and top-level classifiers use this mid-level representation to achieve visual recognition. While in current part-based approaches, mid- and top-level representations are usually jointly trained, this is not the usual case for BoVW schemes. A main reason for this is the complex data association problem related to the usual large dictionary size needed by BoVW approaches. As a further observation, typical solutions based on BoVW and part-based representations are usually limited to extensions of binary classification schemes, a strategy that ignores relevant correlations among classes. In this work we propose a novel hierarchical approach to visual recognition based on a BoVW scheme that jointly learns suitable midand top-level representations. Furthermore, using a maxmargin learning framework, the proposed approach directly handles the multiclass case at both levels of abstraction. We test our proposed method using several popular bench- mark datasets. As our main result, we demonstrate that, by coupling learning of mid- and top-level representations, the proposed approach fosters sharing of discriminative visual words among target classes, being able to achieve state-ofthe-art recognition performance using far less visual words than previous approaches.</p><p>2 0.91505182 <a title="197-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-Semi-supervised_Robust_Dictionary_Learning_via_Efficient_l-Norms_Minimization.html">384 iccv-2013-Semi-supervised Robust Dictionary Learning via Efficient l-Norms Minimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhaowen Wang, Jianchao Yang, Nasser Nasrabadi, Thomas Huang</p><p>Abstract: Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) is a powerful tool in distinguishing signal categories which lie on different subspaces. Despite its wide application to visual recognition tasks, current understanding of SRC is solely based on a reconstructive perspective, which neither offers any guarantee on its classification performance nor provides any insight on how to design a discriminative dictionary for SRC. In this paper, we present a novel perspective towards SRC and interpret it as a margin classifier. The decision boundary and margin of SRC are analyzed in local regions where the support of sparse code is stable. Based on the derived margin, we propose a hinge loss function as the gauge for the classification performance of SRC. A stochastic gradient descent algorithm is implemented to maximize the margin of SRC and obtain more discriminative dictionaries. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting classification performance and improving dictionary quality over reconstructive ones. Classification results competitive with other state-ofthe-art sparse coding methods are reported on several data sets.</p><p>6 0.81432045 <a title="197-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-attributed_Dictionary_Learning_for_Sparse_Coding.html">276 iccv-2013-Multi-attributed Dictionary Learning for Sparse Coding</a></p>

<p>Author: Linjie Yang, Jianzhuang Liu, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: An important topic in computer vision is 3D object reconstruction from line drawings. Previous algorithms either deal with simple general objects or are limited to only manifolds (a subset of solids). In this paper, we propose a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of complex general objects, including manifolds, non-manifold solids, and non-solids. Through developing some 3D object properties, we use the degree of freedom of objects to decompose a complex line drawing into multiple simpler line drawings that represent meaningful building blocks of a complex object. After 3D objects are reconstructed from the decomposed line drawings, they are merged to form a complex object from their touching faces, edges, and vertices. Our experiments show a number of reconstruction examples from both complex line drawings and images with line drawings superimposed. Comparisons are also given to indicate that our algorithm can deal with much more complex line drawings of general objects than previous algorithms. 1. Introduction and Related Work A 2D line drawing is the most straightforward way of illustrating a 3D object. Given a line drawing representing a 3D object, our visual system can understand the 3D structure easily. For example, we can interpret without difficulty the line drawing shown in Fig. 1(a) as a castle with four walls and one door. Imitating this ability has been a longstanding and challenging topic in computer vision when a line drawing is as complex as this example. The applications of this work include 3D object design in CAD and for 3D printers, 3D query generation for 3D object retrieval, and 3D modeling from images. In this paper, same as the majority of related work, a line drawing is defined as the orthogonal projection of the Fig.1 (a)Alinedrawing(rae)pres nti gac stle.(b)The3Dm(obd)el of the line drawing. edges and vertices of a 3D object in a generic view, and objects with planar surfaces are considered. A line drawing is represented by an edge-vertex graph. It can be obtained by the user/designer who draws on the screen with a tablet pen, a mouse, or a finger (on a touch sensitive screen), with all, with some, or without hidden edges and vertices. Line labeling is the earliest work to interpret line drawings [1], [17]. It searches for a set of consistent labels such as convex, concave, and occluding from a line drawing to test its correctness and/or realizability. Line labeling itself cannot recover 3D shape from a line drawing. Later, 3D reconstruction from the contours (line drawings) of objects in images is studied [19], [14], [13], which handles simple objects only. Model-based 3D reconstruction [2], [3], [20] can deal with more complex objects, but these methods require to pre-define a set of parametric models. Recently, popular methods of 3D reconstruction from line drawings are optimization based, which are most related to our work and are reviewed next. These methods can be classified into two categories: one dealing with manifolds and the other dealing with general objects. A general object can be a manifold, non-manifold solid, or non-solid. Manifolds are a subset of solids, defined as follows: A manifold, or more rigorously 2D manifold, is a solid where every point on its surface has a neighborhood topologically equivalent to an open diskin the 2D Euclidean space. 1433 In this paper, a solid is a portion of 3D space bounded by planar faces, and a manifold is also bounded by planar faces. Each edge of such manifolds is shared exactly by two faces [4]. Most 3D reconstruction methods from a line drawing assume that the face topology of the line drawing is known in advance. This information can reduce the reconstruction complexity greatly. Algorithms have been developed to find faces from a line drawing in [16], [10], and [9], where [16] and [10] are for general objects and [9] for manifolds. Optimization-based 3D reconstruction depends on some critera (also called image regularities) that simulate our visual perception. Marill proposes a very simple but effective criterion to reconstruct a simple object: minimizing the standard deviation of the angles (MSDA) in the object [11]. Later, other regularities are proposed to deal with more complex objects such as face planarity, line parallelism, isometry, and corner orthogonality [5], [6], [15], [18]. In these methods, an objective function ?C Φ(z1,z2, ...,zNv) = ?ωiφi(z1,z2, ...,zNv) (1) i?= ?1 is minimized to derive the depths z1, z2 , ..., zNv , where Nv is the number of vertices in the line drawing, φi , i = 1, 2, ..., C, are the regularities, and ωi , i = 1, 2, ..., C, are the weights. The main problem in this approach is that these algorithms are easy to get trapped into local minima (obtaining failed results) when a line drawing is complex with many vertices, due to the search in a highdimensional space (Nv dimensions) with the non-convex objective function. For example, the search space is of 56 dimensions for the object in Fig. 1(a). To alleviate this problem, Liu et al. formulate 3D reconstruction in a lower dimensional space so that the optimization procedure has a better chance to find desired results [7]. For the complex object in Fig. 1(a), however, the search in a space with 18 dimensions is still too difficult for it to obtain a satisfactory 3D object (see Section 3). The methods in [5], [6], [15], [18], and [7] reconstruct general objects, and the one in [7] can deal with more complex objects than the other four. But these algorithms cannot avoid the local minimum problem in a high dimensional search space when a line drawing is complex. In [8], a divide-and-conquer (D&C;) strategy is used to tackle this problem. It first separates a complex line drawing into multiple simpler ones, then independently recovers the 3D objects from these line drawings, and finally merges them to form a complete object. Since the separated line drawings are much simpler than the original one, the 3D reconstruction from each of them is an easy task. This D&C; approach handles manifolds only. Based on known faces found by the face identification algorithm in [9], it uses manifold properties to find internal faces Fig.2(a)Asimaeplhdmiafnbo(ldagc)withnae'fahdc'eisfba'nd(obgcn)'eitrnalfce (a, b, c, d).

(d) Expected decomposition of (c). from a line drawing and then separates the line drawing from the internal faces. An internal face is defined as an imaginary face lying inside a manifold with only its edges visible on the surface [8]. It is not a real face but can be considered as two coincident real faces of identical shape belonging to two manifolds. For example, Fig. 2(a) shows a manifold with nine faces. The D&C; first finds the internal face (a, b, c, d) and then decomposes the line drawing from this internal face (Fig. 2(b)). However, handling manifolds only limits the applica- tions of [8]. In many applications in computer vision and graphics such as 3D object matching, retrieval, and rendering, it is unnecessary to represent objects as manifolds, in order to facilitate data processing and reduce data storage. For example, a flat ground can be represented by a sheet (one face), but if it is represented by a manifold, a thin box with six faces has to be used. Fig. 1(a), Fig. 3(a), and Fig. 3(c) are line drawings of three non-manifolds. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of complex general objects based on visual perception, object properties, and new line drawing decomposition. Compared with previous methods, ours can deal with much more complex line drawings of general objects. It can handle not only manifolds but also non-manifold solids and non-solids, and is insensitive to sketching errors. 2. General Object Reconstruction We also use the D&C; strategy to deal with 3D reconstruction from a line drawing representing a complex general object. The key is how to decompose a complex line drawing of any objects into multiple simpler line drawings. These decomposed line drawings should represent objects that are in accordance with our visual perception, which makes the 3D reconstruction from these line drawings easier and better because the regularities used to build an objective function for reconstruction follow human perception of 1434 common objects [11], [5], [6], [15], [18]. Before the decomposition of a line drawing, we assume that all the real and internal faces of the object have been obtained from the line drawing using a face identification algorithm. For example, the algorithm in [10] finds 10 faces from the line drawing in Fig. 2(a) (including the internal face), and obtains 12 and 7 faces from the line drawings in Figs. 3(a) and (c), respectively. 2.1. Decomposing line drawings of solids In this subsection, we consider the line drawings of solids first. The decomposition method will be extended to the line drawings of general objects in the next subsection. It is not difficult to see that in general, a complex object, especially a manmade complex object, can be considered as the combinations of multiple smaller objects. The most common combination is the touch of two faces from two different objects such as the one in Fig. 2. Other combinations are the touches among lines, faces, and vertices. Our target is to decompose a complex solid into multiple primitive solids. Before the definition of a primitive solid, we introduce a term called the degree of freedom of a solid. Definition 1. The degree of freedom (DoF) of a 3D solid represented by a line drawing is the minimal number of zcoordinates that can uniquely determine this 3D solid. This is the first time that the concept of DoF is used to decompose line drawings. Now let us consider a simple object in Fig. 4(a). The cube has six faces: (v1, v2 , v3 , v4), (v1, v2, v6, v5), (v1, v4, v8, v5), (v2 , v3, v7, v6), (v4, v3, v7, v8), and (v6, v7, v8, v5). We can show that the cube is determined if the z-coordinates of its four non-coplanar vertices are known. Without loss of generality, suppose z1, z2, z4, and z5 are known. Since the 3D coordinates of v1, v2, and v4 are fixed (remind that the x- and y-coordinates of all the vertices are known under the orthogonal projection), the 3D plane passing through the face (v1, v2 , v3, v4) is determined, and thus z3 can be calculated. Similarly, z6 and z8 can be obtained. Finally, z7 can be computed with the 3D coordinates of v3, v4, and v8 known, which determine the plane passing through the face (v4, v3, v7, v8). So the 3D cube can be determined by the known four z-coordinates, z1, z2, z4, and z5. Further, it can be verified that three 3D vertices cannot determine this object uniquely because they can only define one face in 3D space. Therefore, the DoF of the cube is 4. Similar analysis allows us to know that the solids in Fig. 2(b), Fig. 3(b), and Fig. 4(b) all have DoF 4, while the two solids in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 3(a) have DoFs 5 and 6, respectively. From these analysis, we can have the intuition that solids with DoF 4 serve as the building blocks of more complex solids whose DoFs are more than 4. Besides, we have the following property: Property 1. There is no solid with DoF less than 4. Fv5(1iga).4v (26a)Av48cubev3w7hos(be)DoFis4.(b)Anedo(tch)fergBasbolifdAwhosfCeDocFji is also 4. (c) Part of a line drawing with each vertex of degree 3. This property is easy to verify. A solid with fewest faces is a tetrahedron. Every two of its four faces are not co-planar. Three 3D vertices of a tetrahedron can only determine one 3D face. Next, we define primitive solids. Definition 2. A 3D solid represented by a line drawing is called a primitive solid if its DoF is 4. Property 2. If every vertex of a 3D solid represented by a line drawing has degree 31, then it is a primitive solid. Proof. Let part of such a line drawing be the one as shown in Fig. 4(c). At each vertex, every two of the three edges form a face, because a solid is bounded by faces without dangling faces and edges. Let the three paths fA, fB, and fC in Fig. 4(c) denote the three faces at vertex a. Without loss of generality, suppose that the four zcoordinates (and thus the four 3D coordinates) of vertices a, b, c, and d are known. Then the three planes passing through fA, fB, and fC are determined in 3D space. With the two known 3D planes passing through fA and fB at vertex b, the 3D coordinates of vertices g and h connected to b can be computed. Similarly, the 3D coordinates of vertices e and f connected to d and the 3D coordinates of vertices i and j connected to c can be obtained. Furthermore, all the 3D coordinates of the other vertices connected to e, f, g, h, i, and j can be derived in the same way. This derivation can propagate to all the vertices of this solid. Therefore, the DoF of this solid is 4 and it is a primitive solid. Property 3. The DoF of a solid is 5 which is obtained by gluing two faces of two primitive solids. Proof. Let the two primitive solids be PS1 and PS2 and their corresponding gluing faces be f1and f2, respectively. The DoFs of PS1 and PS2 are both 4. Suppose that PS1 is determined in 3D space, which requires four z-coordinates. Then f1and f2 are also determined in 3D space. When the z-coordinates of three vertices on PS2 are known based on f2, one more z-coordinate of a vertex not coplanar with f2 on PS2 can determine PS2 in 3D space. Therefore, the DoF of the combined solid is 5. Fig. 2 is a typical example of two primitive solids gluing together along faces. Fig. 3(a) is an example of two primitive solids gluing together along edges. Two primitive solids may also connect at one vertex. The following property is easy to verify. 1The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to this vertex. 1435 Property 4. The DoF of a solid is 6 which is obtained by gluing two edges of two primitive solids. The DoF of a solid is 7 which is obtained by gluing two vertices oftwoprimitive solids. From the above properties, we can see that primitive solids are indeed the “smallest” solids in terms of DoF and they can serve as the building blocks to construct more complex solids. Therefore, our next target is to decompose a line drawing representing a complex solid into multiple line drawings representing primitive solids. Before giving Definition 3, we define some terms first. Vertex set of a face. The vertex set V er(f) of a face f is the set of all the vertices of f. Fixed vertex. A fixed vertex is one with its z-coordinate (thus its 3D coordinate) known. Unfixed vertex. An unfixed vertex is one with its zcoordinate unknown. Fixed face. A fixed face is one with its 3D position determined by its three fixed vertices. Unfixed face. An unfixed face is one with its 3D position undetermined. Definition 3. Let the vertex set and the face set of a line drawing be V = {v1, v2 , ..., vn} and F = {f1, f2 , ..., fm}, respectively, w =he {rve n and m are Fthe = n{fumbers of th}e, vertices and the faces, respectively. Also let Vfixed, Ffixed, Vunfixed, and Funfixed be the sets of fixed vertices, fixed faces, unfixed vertices, and unfixed faces, respectively. Suppose that an initial set of two fixed neighboring faces sharing an edge is Finitial with all their fixed vertices in Vinitial. The final Ffixed in Algorithm 1 is called the maximum extended face set (MEFS) from Finitial. In Algorithm 1, a face f that satisfies the condition in step 3 is a face that has been determined in 3D space by the current fixed vertices in Ffixed. When this face is found, it becomes a fixed face and all its vertices become fixed vertices. The DoF of the initial two fixed faces combined is 4. It is not difficult to see that the algorithm does not increase the initial DoF, and thus the final object represented by the MEFS also has DoF 4. Next, let us consider a simple example shown in Fig. 2(a) with the following three cases: Case 1. Suppose that Finitial = {(e, f,g, h) , (e, f,b, a)}, Vinitial = {e, f,g, h, b, a}, and th{e( algorithm a(de,dfs tbh,ea f}a,c Ves into Ffixed ,ing thh,isb aor}d,e ar:n (f th,e g, c, obr)i →m (a, b, c, d) → (e, h, d, a) →i ( tgh, hs, odr, dce)r.

Note that the algorithm does not add any triangular faces into Ffixed because they do not satisfy the condition in step 3. Case 2.

Fig.5(a)Ac(oam)plexinedrawingofn (-bm)anifolds id.(b)The decomposition result by our algorithm. In case 3, the object represented by the MEFS has only two initial faces and this object is discarded. In order not to miss a primitive solid, we run Algorithm 1 multiple times each with a different pair of neighboring faces in Finitial. Then, we can always have Finitial with its two faces from one primitive solid. For the object in Fig. 2(a), we can always find the cube and the pyramid. Note that the same primitive solid may be found multiple times from different Finitial, and finally we keep only one copy of each different object (cube and pyramid in this example). When a complex solid is formed by more than two primitive solids, Algorithm 1 can still be used to find the primitive solids, which is the decomposition result of the complex line drawing. More complex examples are given in Section 3. Besides, Algorithm 1 can also deal with complex solids formed by gluing primitive solids between edges and vertices. Fig. 5(a) is a solid constructed by gluing eight primitive solids between faces, edges, and vertices. Running Algorithm 1multiple times with different pairs of neighboring faces in Finitial generates the primitive solids as shown in Fig. 5(b). 2.2. Decomposing line drawings of general objects A general object can be a manifold, non-manifold solid, or non-solid. Given a line drawing representing a general object, it is unknown whether this object consists of only primitive solids. However, we can always apply Algorithm 1to the line drawing multiple times, each with a 1436 Obj6(4)O b j 15( 94)(ca)O b j 24(9 7)Obj3(7)(bd) Fig. 6. Illustration of our decomposition method.

(d) The decomposition of (a). different pair of neighboring faces in Finitial, generating a set SMEFS of MEFSs (recall that an MEFS with only two initial neighboring faces is discarded). In what follows, we also call an MEFS an object, which is represented by the MEFS. Note that an MEFS generated from a general line drawing may not be a primitive solid, but its DoF must be 4. Objects of DoF 4 have relatively simple structures and are easy to be reconstructed. A number of decomposition examples of complex general line drawings can be seen from the experimental section. One issue existing in this decomposition method is that two different MEFSs may share many faces. For example, from the line drawing in Fig. 6(a), all different MEFSs found by running Algorithm 1multiple times are shown in Fig. 6(b), where Obj 1and Obj 5 share four faces, and so do Obj 2 and Obj 6. Obviously, Obj 5 and Obj 6 are not necessary. Next we define object coexistence and a rule to choose objects. Definition 4. Two objects are called coexistent if they share no face or share only coplanar faces. Rule 1. Choose a subset of SMEFS such that in the subset, all the objects are coexistent and the number of total faces is maximized. From Definition 4, Obj 1 and Obj 5 are not coexistent in Fig. 6, and Obj 2 and Obj 6 are not either. If Obj 5 and Obj 6 are kept with Obj 1and Obj 2 discarded, many faces in the original object will be missing. Rule 1guarantees that Obj 1and Obj 2 are kept but not Obj 5 and Obj 6.

Fig.7 (a)Ashe tobjec(ta)with23faces.(b)Decompositon(br)esult by Algorithm 2 with the modification in Algorithm 1. We formulate Rule 1 as a maximum weight clique problem (MWCP), which is to find a clique2 of the maximum weight from a weighted graph. First, we construct a weighted graph, called the object-coexistence graph, in which a vertex denotes an object in SMEFS and there is an edge connecting two vertices if the two objects represented by the two vertices are coexistent. Besides, each vertex is assigned a weight equal to the number of the faces of the corresponding object. The MWCP is a well-known NP-hard problem. In our application, however, solving this problem is fast enough since an object-coexistence graph usually has less than 20 objects (vertices). We use the algorithm in [12] to deal with this problem. Fig. 6(c) is the object-coexistence graph constructed from the six objects in Fig. 6(b), where the weights of the vertices are denoted by the numbers in the parentheses. The maximum weight clique is shown in bold. From Fig. 6, we see that the face (14, 13, 26, 25) is not contained in SWMC, which is used to store the objects in the maximum weight clique. This face is finally attached to Obj 3. In general, each of the faces not in SWMC is attached to an object that contains the maximum number of the vertices of this face. If there are two or more objects that contain the same number of the vertices of this face, this face is assigned to any of them. 2A clique is a subgraph of a graph such that subgraph are connected by an edge. every two vertices in the 1437 Algorithm 2 shows the complete algorithm to decompose a general line drawing. Steps 7 and 8 attach the faces not in SMWC to some objects in SMWC. A common complex object usually consists of primitive solids and sheets, and Algorithm 2 works well for the decomposition of most complex line drawings. However, there are still some line drawings the algorithm cannot deal with. Such an example is shown in Fig. 7(a) which is a sheet object with 23 faces. In Algorithm 1, with any pair of initial neighboring faces, there is no any other face satisfying the condition in step 3, thus no object of DoF 4 will be found. The following scheme can solve this problem. Given a line drawing, steps 1–6 in Algorithm 2 are used to decompose it into multiple objects of DoF 4. If there are separate groups of faces not in SMWC, where the faces in each group are connected, then attach the groups each with less than four faces to some objects in SMWC3 (the attachment method is similar to steps 7 and 8 in Algorithm 2). For a group with four or more connected faces, Algorithm 2 is applied to it with a minor modification in Algorithm 1. The modification is to set Finitial to contain three connected faces whose combined DoF is 5. This modification allows the search of objects of DoF 5. Suppose the object in Fig. 7(a) is such a group. Applying Algorithm 2 to it with the minor modification generates the decomposition result as shown in Fig. 7(b). 2.3. 3D Reconstruction A complex line drawing can be decomposed into several simpler ones using the method proposed in Sections 2. 1 and 2.2. The next step is to reconstruct a 3D object from each ofthem, which is an easy task because the decomposed line drawings are simple. The method in [6] or [7] can carry out this task very well. We use the one in [6] for our work with the objective function Φ(z1 , z2 , ..., zNv ) constructed by these five image regularities: MSDA, face planarity, line parallelism, isometry, and corner orthogonality. The details of the regularities can be found from [6]. After obtaining the 3D objects from all the decomposed line drawings, the next step is to merge them to form one complex object. When merging two 3D objects, since they are reconstructed separately, the gluing parts (face or edge) of them are usually not of the same size. Then one object is automatically rescaled according to the sizes of the two gluing parts, and the vertices of the gluing part of this object are also adjusted so that the two parts are the same. After merging all the 3D objects, the whole object is fine-tuned by minimizing the objective function Φ on the object. We can also apply our method to reconstruct 3D shapes from objects in images. First, the user draws a line drawing along the visible edges of an object and he/she can also 3The reason to attach a group with less than four faces to an object in SMWC is that this group is small and is not necessary to be an independent object to reconstruct. guess (draw) the hidden edges. Then from this line drawing, our approach described above reconstructs the 3D geometry of the object in the image. 3. Experimental Results In this section, we show a number of complex 3D reconstruction examples from both line drawings and images to demonstrate the performance of our approach. The first set of experiments in Fig. 8 has nine complex line drawings. Fig. 8(a) is a manifold, and the others are nonmanifold solids or non-solids. The decompositions of the line drawings are also given in the figure, from which we can see that the results are in accordance with our visual perception very well. All the primitive solids are found by our algorithm. It is the successful decompositions that make the 3D reconstructions from these complex line drawings possible. The expected satisfactory reconstruction results are shown also in Fig. 8 each in two views. Fig. 9 shows another set of 3D reconstructions from objects in images with line drawings drawn on the objects. The decomposition results are omitted due to the space limitation. Each reconstruction result obtained by our algorithm is shown in two views with the texture from the image mapped onto the surface. We can see that the results are very good. The details of the objects and the line drawings can be shown by enlarging the figures on the screen. Among all the previous algorithms for general object reconstruction, the one in [7] can deal with most complex objects. Due to the local minimum problem in a high dimensional search space, however, this algorithm cannot handle line drawings as complex as those in Figs. 8 and 9. For example, Fig. 10(a) shows its reconstruction result from the line drawing in Fig. 8(c), which is a failure. The reader may wonder what happens if the 3D reconstruction is based on an arbitrary decomposition of a complex line drawing, instead of the proposed one. Fig. 10(b) shows such a decomposition from Fig. 8(c). Based on this decomposition, the 3D reconstruction result obtained by the scheme described in Section 2.3 is given in Fig. 10(c), which is a failure. The failure is caused by two reasons: (i) An arbitrary decomposition usually does not generate common objects, which makes the image regularities less meaningful for the 3D reconstruction. (ii) The gluing of 3D objects from the decomposition in Fig. 10(b) is difficult because of the irregular touches between the objects. The fine-tuning processing (see Section 2.3) cannot reduce the large distortion to an acceptable result. Note that since our algorithm is not limited to manifolds, it can deal with line drawings with some or without hidden lines. The third line drawing in Fig. 9 is an example where some hidden lines are not drawn. Most of the line drawings in this paper look tidy. This 1438 (g)(h)(i) Fig. 8.

In fact, our algorithm is not sensitive to sketching errors. Take Fig. 8(a) as an example and assume it is an accurate projection of the 3D object. Then, random variations are generated with the Gaussian distribution N(0, σ2) on the 2D locations of the vertices. Fig. 11(a) is a resulting noisy line drawing with σ = W/200 where W is the width of the line drawing in Fig. 8(a). From Fig. 11, we see that even for this line drawing with strong sketching errors, our algorithm can still obtain the good reconstruction result. Our algorithm is implemented in C++. The computational time includes two parts: line drawing decomposition and 3D reconstruction. The main computation is consumed by the second part. On average, a common PC takes about one minute to obtain the reconstruction from each of the line drawings in Figs. 8 and 9. 4. Conclusion Previous algorithms of 3D object reconstruction from line drawings either deal with simple general objects or are limited to only manifolds (a subset of solids). In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach that can handle complex general objects, including manifolds, nonmanifold solids, and non-solids. It decomposes a complex line drawing into simpler ones according to the degree of freedom of objects, which is based on the developed 3D object properties. After 3D objects are reconstructed from the decomposed line drawings, they are merged to form a complex object. We have shown a number of reconstruction examples with comparison to the best previous algorithm. The results indicate that our algorithm can tackle much more complex line drawings of general objects and is insensitive to sketching errors. The future work includes (i) the correction of the distortions of 3D objects reconstructed from images caused by the perspective projection, and (ii) the extension of this work to objects with curved faces.

To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised learning framework for cosegmentation, by coupling cosegmentation with what we call “cosketch ”. The goal of cosketch is to automatically discover a codebook of deformable shape templates shared by the input images. These shape templates capture distinct image patterns and each template is matched to similar image patches in different images. Thus the cosketch of the images helps to align foreground objects, thereby providing crucial information for cosegmentation. We present a statistical model whose energy function couples cosketch and cosegmentation. We then present an unsupervised learning algorithm that performs cosketch and cosegmentation by energy minimization. Experiments show that our method outperforms state of the art methods for cosegmentation on the challenging MSRC and iCoseg datasets. We also illustrate our method on a new dataset called Coseg-Rep where cosegmentation can be performed within a single image with repetitive patterns.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.90317428 <a title="197-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Hierarchical_Joint_Max-Margin_Learning_of_Mid_and_Top_Level_Representations_for_Visual_Recognition.html">197 iccv-2013-Hierarchical Joint Max-Margin Learning of Mid and Top Level Representations for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Hans Lobel, René Vidal, Alvaro Soto</p><p>Abstract: Currently, Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) and part-based methods are the most popular approaches for visual recognition. In both cases, a mid-level representation is built on top of low-level image descriptors and top-level classifiers use this mid-level representation to achieve visual recognition. While in current part-based approaches, mid- and top-level representations are usually jointly trained, this is not the usual case for BoVW schemes. A main reason for this is the complex data association problem related to the usual large dictionary size needed by BoVW approaches. As a further observation, typical solutions based on BoVW and part-based representations are usually limited to extensions of binary classification schemes, a strategy that ignores relevant correlations among classes. In this work we propose a novel hierarchical approach to visual recognition based on a BoVW scheme that jointly learns suitable midand top-level representations. Furthermore, using a maxmargin learning framework, the proposed approach directly handles the multiclass case at both levels of abstraction. We test our proposed method using several popular bench- mark datasets. As our main result, we demonstrate that, by coupling learning of mid- and top-level representations, the proposed approach fosters sharing of discriminative visual words among target classes, being able to achieve state-ofthe-art recognition performance using far less visual words than previous approaches.</p><p>4 0.88141859 <a title="197-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-From_Where_and_How_to_What_We_See.html">180 iccv-2013-From Where and How to What We See</a></p>

Manjunath</p><p>Abstract: Eye movement studies have confirmed that overt attention is highly biased towards faces and text regions in images. In this paper we explore a novel problem of predicting face and text regions in images using eye tracking data from multiple subjects. The problem is challenging as we aim to predict the semantics (face/text/background) only from eye tracking data without utilizing any image information. The proposed algorithm spatially clusters eye tracking data obtained in an image into different coherent groups and subsequently models the likelihood of the clusters containing faces and text using afully connectedMarkov Random Field (MRF). Given the eye tracking datafrom a test image, itpredicts potential face/head (humans, dogs and cats) and text locations reliably. Furthermore, the approach can be used to select regions of interest for further analysis by object detectors for faces and text. The hybrid eye position/object detector approach achieves better detection performance and reduced computation time compared to using only the object detection algorithm. We also present a new eye tracking dataset on 300 images selected from ICDAR, Street-view, Flickr and Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset from 15 subjects.</p><p>5 0.88029087 <a title="197-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Model_Recommendation_with_Virtual_Probes_for_Egocentric_Hand_Detection.html">267 iccv-2013-Model Recommendation with Virtual Probes for Egocentric Hand Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Cheng Li, Kris M. Kitani</p><p>Abstract: Egocentric cameras can be used to benefit such tasks as analyzing fine motor skills, recognizing gestures and learning about hand-object manipulation. To enable such technology, we believe that the hands must detected on thepixellevel to gain important information about the shape of the hands and fingers. We show that the problem of pixel-wise hand detection can be effectively solved, by posing the problem as a model recommendation task. As such, the goal of a recommendation system is to recommend the n-best hand detectors based on the probe set a small amount of labeled data from the test distribution. This requirement of a probe set is a serious limitation in many applications, such as ego-centric hand detection, where the test distribution may be continually changing. To address this limitation, we propose the use of virtual probes which can be automatically extracted from the test distribution. The key idea is – that many features, such as the color distribution or relative performance between two detectors, can be used as a proxy to the probe set. In our experiments we show that the recommendation paradigm is well-equipped to handle complex changes in the appearance of the hands in firstperson vision. In particular, we show how our system is able to generalize to new scenarios by testing our model across multiple users.</p><p>6 0.87749404 <a title="197-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Predicting_Sufficient_Annotation_Strength_for_Interactive_Foreground_Segmentation.html">326 iccv-2013-Predicting Sufficient Annotation Strength for Interactive Foreground Segmentation</a></p>

</p><p>4 To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure. [sent-5, score-0.311]
</p><p>5 To validate our method we present results on data from medical imaging in angiography and retinal blood vessel segmentation. [sent-6, score-0.404]
</p><p>6 While state-of-the-art segmentation methods [8, 18, 29] perform well for segmenting compact objects, their performance on thin and elongated structures is often not satisfying. [sent-9, score-0.401]
</p><p>7 The commonly used length regularizer suppresses small structures and the correct topology cannot be reconstructed. [sent-10, score-0.155]
</p><p>8 First, curvature based measures have attracted the interest of researchers in computer vision to include them in image segmentation frameworks [17, 25, 14]. [sent-12, score-0.241]
</p><p>9 However, introducing these regularizers into segmentation algorithms leads to higher order cost functions, which are hard to optimize. [sent-13, score-0.149]
</p><p>10 Another way to preserve thin structures is to use topological constraints. [sent-14, score-0.159]
</p><p>11 A special subclass of these constraints are connectivity constraints, which ensure the connectedness of a labeled region and therefore allow that thin connections Caltech  TU M ¨unchen  angiography. [sent-15, score-0.562]
</p><p>12 The connectivity constraint allows to connect previously unconnected regions while noise is successfully removed. [sent-16, score-0.484]
</p><p>13 Left image and top right: Lung vessel tree segmented with the proposed method. [sent-17, score-0.266]
</p><p>14 Bottom right: Result of the algorithm using the same parameters but without the connectivity constraint. [sent-18, score-0.367]
</p><p>15 between foreground regions are preserved in the final segmentation result. [sent-19, score-0.268]
</p><p>16 To overcome the limitation of topology preserving level set methods [19], that only locally optimal  solutions can be achieved, recent approaches include topological constraints in random field models [30, 23, 11]. [sent-20, score-0.232]
</p><p>17 [3 1] a topology preserving extension of the GraphCut method [9] is presented. [sent-25, score-0.156]
</p><p>18 The method is initialized on a coarser scale and then refines the segmentation while preserving the topology. [sent-26, score-0.196]
</p><p>19 Similar to topology preserving level set methods [19] this method converges only to a local minimum of the energy. [sent-27, score-0.156]
</p><p>20 [30] introduce a Markov random field segmentation model extended with a connectivity constraint for user given seed nodes, that should be connected to the foreground segment. [sent-29, score-0.812]
</p><p>21 They prove that even when the model only contains unary terms solving the image segmentation problem with these constraints is NP-hard. [sent-30, score-0.186]
</p><p>22 Therefore they introduce a heuristic algorithm that is essentially a Dijkstra algorithm into which a graph cut algorithm is embedded, but which can only provide an approximate solution when the random field contains pairwise energies. [sent-31, score-0.166]
</p><p>23 Another recent approach to enforce connectivity of the foreground region is the work of Nowozin and Lampert [23]. [sent-32, score-0.486]
</p><p>24 They formulate the constrained image segmentation problem as a linear programming (LP) relaxation which can in principle be solved globally optimally. [sent-33, score-0.149]
</p><p>25 One application field of methods that preserve elongated structures is in angiography, were thin structures like blood vessels need to be segmented. [sent-36, score-0.521]
</p><p>26 Some of the most promising existing methods for this special task are based on geodesic shortest paths. [sent-37, score-0.521]
</p><p>27 Instead of modeling the objects that should be segmented explicitly as connected paths some authors propose to first preprocess the image data with filters that show a strong response in areas were elongated structures are present [16, 21]. [sent-39, score-0.344]
</p><p>28 [3] a similar approach leads to an explicit model of short tubular segments that are in a second step connected to a whole tree of branching tubular structures. [sent-41, score-0.499]
</p><p>29 Therefore a connection confidence measure to join adjacent tube segments is defined, that depends on the distance and joining angle of the segments. [sent-42, score-0.107]
</p><p>30 The resulting minimization problem is solved by using the graph cut algorithm [9]. [sent-43, score-0.166]

</p><p>32 Problem Formulation  Given an image I with the domain Ω, a bounded connected subset of Rm, we wish to solve the constrained optimization problem  ‘∈m{i0n,1}ΩZf(x)‘(x)dx + λPer(Σ‘=1)  (1)  s. [sent-47, score-0.127]
</p><p>33 (C0) The discrete label assignment ‘ : Ω → {0, 1} describes if an image region belongs mtoe tnhte ‘ object →of { i0n,te1r}es dte ‘s(cxri)b e=s i1f or the image background ‘(x) = 0. [sent-50, score-0.042]
</p><p>34 The set Σ‘=1 = {x ∈ Ω : ‘(x) = 1} is the foreground region, a subs{ext o ∈f t hΩe image d =om a1i}n. [sent-51, score-0.119]

[sent-54, score-1.178]
</p><p>37 This constraint ensures that the whole foreground region is connected. [sent-55, score-0.202]

</p><p>41 We show how a-priori information about the geometry of the structure of interest can be included when constructing this shortest path tree. [sent-62, score-0.528]
</p><p>42 To solve the resulting labeling problem, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph. [sent-63, score-0.249]

</p><p>46 (C1) In contrast to the original image segmentation problem, we will show in section 3. [sent-69, score-0.149]
</p><p>47 3 that this constraint can be introduced as a linear constraint in a convex optimization framework and therefore allows for an optimal solution. [sent-70, score-0.286]
</p><p>48 Constructing the Geodesic Shortest Path Tree The shortest geodesic path topology is inspired by image segmentation methods based on shortest geodesic distances, that have been successfully applied to medical im-  age segmentation [4] and general image segmentation as well [2, 12]. [sent-73, score-1.788]
</p><p>49 It allows to use an image depending local geodesic metric and additionally to incorporate a-priori knowledge about the geometry of the object of interest. [sent-74, score-0.184]
</p><p>50 22333377  First we have to choose an appropriate local geodesic metric. [sent-75, score-0.184]
</p><p>51 If λ = 0 the labeling function u(x) takes the value 1for f(x) < 0 and 0 for f(x) > 0. [sent-76, score-0.063]
</p><p>52 We leave out the special case f(x) = 0 as it does not occur in practice. [sent-77, score-0.05]

</p><p>54 The optimal cost of the connecting path between a )fix ≥ed 0 s Tahnde any x in the region that should be connected on Gs is then given by  mCsixnZ0Tf+(C(t))dt,  (2)  with f+ = max(0, f(x)). [sent-79, score-0.335]
</p><p>55 Bending Energy Prior Further a-priori information about the geometry of the object that should be segmented can be included in the framework. [sent-83, score-0.038]
</p><p>56 For the special case of blood vessel segmentation in medical imaging a reasonable assumption would be, that the structure of interest ideally minimizes its bending energy. [sent-84, score-0.781]
</p><p>57 To compute the bending energy we use the discretized bending energy of Bergou et al. [sent-86, score-0.721]
</p><p>58 It is expressed using the curvature binormal  (κb)t=|et−12||eett−|1 +× et e−t1· et  (4)  with et = xt+1 − xt and et−1 = xt − xt−1 . [sent-88, score-0.636]
</p><p>59 Because this is an integrated quantity, dividing it− by the length of the domain of integration, in this case half the length lt = |et | + |et−1 | of the edges joining at xt, gives the discretized |veer|s+ion|e of th|e o bending energy  Ebend(xt) =21α? [sent-89, score-0.513]
</p><p>60 (5)  The curvature binormal (κb)t depends not only on the position xt but also on the positions of the neighboring nodes xt+1 and xt−1 . [sent-92, score-0.471]
</p><p>61 Finally, the combination of the non negative data term and the bending energy prior lead to the shortest path prob-  lem  mCinZ0Tf+(C(t)) + Ebend(C(t))dt. [sent-93, score-0.885]

</p><p>63 The bending energy depends on the two edges et−1 and et joining at a node xt. [sent-95, score-0.534]
</p><p>64 Note that this is not a usual geodesic measure, because the bending energy term depends on the incoming and outgoing angle. [sent-96, score-0.575]
</p><p>65 Instead, such cost functions can be minimized by computing a shortest path on a higher order graph, which contains a node for every edge in the original graph i. [sent-98, score-0.808]
</p><p>66 for every pair of nodes that are connected by an edge in the original graph [1]. [sent-100, score-0.363]
</p><p>67 Because our major contribution in this paper is the labeling of the nodes via convex optimization, we approximate the minimal path using a greedy  optimization scheme, in this case Dijkstra’s [13] algorithm on the vertex graph. [sent-101, score-0.555]
</p><p>68 6 for the candidate nodes xt+1 is computed by taking the predecessor xt−1 in the current shortest path to xt. [sent-103, score-0.616]
</p><p>69 Thus this approximation does not take into account different incoming angles to the node xt but assumes this angle to be fixed by xt−1 . [sent-104, score-0.353]

</p><p>72 In the continuous framework, the image segmentation problem with C1 has the form  u∈m[0in,1]ΩZf(x)u(x) + λ|∇u|dx s. [sent-109, score-0.215]
</p><p>73 (7) (C1)  In the following we show how this continuous image segmentation problem can be equivalently transformed to the domain of a discrete graph. [sent-112, score-0.257]

</p><p>75 As a consequence, the labeling problem on the weighted graph can be solved efficiently using a recent algorithm for continuous convex optimization [10]. [sent-114, score-0.418]
</p><p>76 While ensuring connectivity constraints in image segmentation algorithms is usually difficult and in general not optimally solvable our method allows to include the connectivity prior directly in the convex optimization framework. [sent-115, score-1.04]

</p><p>96 The second advantage of our framework is that a connectivity constraint can be included very easily. [sent-146, score-0.45]

<p>Author: Jan Stühmer, Peter Schröder, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to include a connectivity prior into image segmentation that is based on a binary labeling of a directed graph, in this case a geodesic shortest path tree. Specifically we make two contributions: First, we construct a geodesic shortest path tree with a distance measure that is related to the image data and the bending energy of each path in the tree. Second, we include a connectivity prior in our segmentation model, that allows to segment not only a single elongated structure, but instead a whole connected branching tree. Because both our segmentation model and the connectivity constraint are convex, a global optimal solution can be found. To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure. To validate our method we present results on data from medical imaging in angiography and retinal blood vessel segmentation.</p><p>2 0.20093402 <a title="429-tfidf-2" href="./iccv-2013-Shortest_Paths_with_Curvature_and_Torsion.html">389 iccv-2013-Shortest Paths with Curvature and Torsion</a></p>
<p>Author: Petter Strandmark, Johannes Ulén, Fredrik Kahl, Leo Grady</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a method of finding thin, elongated structures in images and volumes. We use shortest paths to minimize very general functionals of higher-order curve properties, such as curvature and torsion. Our globally optimal method uses line graphs and its runtime is polynomial in the size of the discretization, often in the order of seconds on a single computer. To our knowledge, we are the first to perform experiments in three dimensions with curvature and torsion regularization. The largest graphs we process have almost one hundred billion arcs. Experiments on medical images and in multi-view reconstruction show the significance and practical usefulness of regularization based on curvature while torsion is still only tractable for small-scale problems.</p><p>3 0.17451163 <a title="429-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Image_Partitioning_Using_Decision_Trees_with_Structured_Split_Criteria.html">448 iccv-2013-Weakly Supervised Learning of Image Partitioning Using Decision Trees with Structured Split Criteria</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph Straehle, Ullrich Koethe, Fred A. Hamprecht</p><p>Abstract: We propose a scheme that allows to partition an image into a previously unknown number of segments, using only minimal supervision in terms of a few must-link and cannotlink annotations. We make no use of regional data terms, learning instead what constitutes a likely boundary between segments. Since boundaries are only implicitly specified through cannot-link constraints, this is a hard and nonconvex latent variable problem. We address this problem in a greedy fashion using a randomized decision tree on features associated with interpixel edges. We use a structured purity criterion during tree construction and also show how a backtracking strategy can be used to prevent the greedy search from ending up in poor local optima.

<p>Author: Ryan Tokola, Wongun Choi, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to multi-target tracking that has expressive potential beyond the capabilities of chainshaped hidden Markov models, yet has significantly reduced complexity. Our framework, which we call tracking-byselection, is similar to tracking-by-detection in that it separates the tasks of detection and tracking, but it shifts tempo-labs . com Stanford, CA ssi lvio @ st an ford . edu ral reasoning from the tracking stage to the detection stage. The core feature of tracking-by-selection is that it reasons about path hypotheses that traverse the entire video instead of a chain of single-frame object hypotheses. A traditional chain-shaped tracking-by-detection model is only able to promote consistency between one frame and the next. In tracking-by-selection, path hypotheses exist across time, and encouraging long-term temporal consistency is as simple as rewarding path hypotheses with consistent image features. One additional advantage of tracking-by-selection is that it results in a dramatically simplified model that can be solved exactly. We adapt an existing tracking-by-detection model to the tracking-by-selectionframework, and show improvedperformance on a challenging dataset (introduced in [18]).</p><p>5 0.15037893 <a title="429-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Segmentation_and_Pose_Tracking_of_Human_in_Natural_Videos.html">225 iccv-2013-Joint Segmentation and Pose Tracking of Human in Natural Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Taegyu Lim, Seunghoon Hong, Bohyung Han, Joon Hee Han</p><p>Abstract: We propose an on-line algorithm to extract a human by foreground/background segmentation and estimate pose of the human from the videos captured by moving cameras. We claim that a virtuous cycle can be created by appropriate interactions between the two modules to solve individual problems. This joint estimation problem is divided into two subproblems, , foreground/background segmentation and pose tracking, which alternate iteratively for optimization; segmentation step generates foreground mask for human pose tracking, and human pose tracking step provides foreground response map for segmentation. The final solution is obtained when the iterative procedure converges. We evaluate our algorithm quantitatively and qualitatively in real videos involving various challenges, and present its outstandingperformance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques for segmentation and pose estimation.</p><p>6 0.13754618 <a title="429-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Motion_for_Every_Visible_Point.html">441 iccv-2013-Video Motion for Every Visible Point</a></p>

Specifically we make two contributions: First, we construct a geodesic shortest path tree with a distance measure that is related to the image data and the bending energy of each path in the tree. Second, we include a connectivity prior in our segmentation model, that allows to segment not only a single elongated structure, but instead a whole connected branching tree. Because both our segmentation model and the connectivity constraint are convex, a global optimal solution can be found. To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure.

<p>Author: Carl Olsson, Johannes Ulén, Yuri Boykov, Vladimir Kolmogorov</p><p>Abstract: Energies with high-order non-submodular interactions have been shown to be very useful in vision due to their high modeling power. Optimization of such energies, however, is generally NP-hard. A naive approach that works for small problem instances is exhaustive search, that is, enumeration of all possible labelings of the underlying graph. We propose a general minimization approach for large graphs based on enumeration of labelings of certain small patches. This partial enumeration technique reduces complex highorder energy formulations to pairwise Constraint Satisfaction Problems with unary costs (uCSP), which can be efficiently solved using standard methods like TRW-S. Our approach outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art algorithms on well known difficult problems (e.g. curvature regularization, stereo, deconvolution); it gives near global minimum and better speed. Our main application of interest is curvature regularization. In the context of segmentation, our partial enumeration technique allows to evaluate curvature directly on small patches using a novel integral geometry approach. 1</p><p>4 0.63605511 <a title="429-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Potts_Model%2C_Parametric_Maxflow_and_K-Submodular_Functions.html">324 iccv-2013-Potts Model, Parametric Maxflow and K-Submodular Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Igor Gridchyn, Vladimir Kolmogorov</p><p>Abstract: The problem of minimizing the Potts energy function frequently occurs in computer vision applications. One way to tackle this NP-hard problem was proposed by Kovtun [20, 21]. It identifies a part of an optimal solution by running k maxflow computations, where k is the number of labels. The number of “labeled” pixels can be significant in some applications, e.g. 50-93% in our tests for stereo. We show how to reduce the runtime to O(log k) maxflow computations (or one parametric maxflow computation). Furthermore, the output of our algorithm allows to speed-up the subsequent alpha expansion for the unlabeled part, or can be used as it is for time-critical applications. To derive our technique, we generalize the algorithm of Felzenszwalb et al. [7] for Tree Metrics. We also show a connection to k-submodular functions from combinatorial optimization, and discuss k-submodular relaxations for general energy functions.</p><p>5 0.63164127 <a title="429-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Image_Partitioning_Using_Decision_Trees_with_Structured_Split_Criteria.html">448 iccv-2013-Weakly Supervised Learning of Image Partitioning Using Decision Trees with Structured Split Criteria</a></p>

<p>Author: Yannis Avrithis</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by the close relation between nearest neighbor search and clustering in high-dimensional spaces as well as the success of one helping to solve the other, we introduce a new paradigm where both problems are solved simultaneously. Our solution is recursive, not in the size of input data but in the number of dimensions. One result is a clustering algorithm that is tuned to small codebooks but does not need all data in memory at the same time and is practically constant in the data size. As a by-product, a tree structure performs either exact or approximate quantization on trained centroids, the latter being not very precise but extremely fast. A lesser contribution is a new indexing scheme for image retrieval that exploits multiple small codebooks to provide an arbitrarily fine partition of the descriptor space. Large scale experiments on public datasets exhibit state of the art performance and remarkable generalization.</p><p>3 0.65973878 <a title="429-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Estimating_the_Material_Properties_of_Fabric_from_Video.html">145 iccv-2013-Estimating the Material Properties of Fabric from Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Katherine L. Bouman, Bei Xiao, Peter Battaglia, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: Passively estimating the intrinsic material properties of deformable objects moving in a natural environment is essential for scene understanding. We present a framework to automatically analyze videos of fabrics moving under various unknown wind forces, and recover two key material properties of the fabric: stiffness and area weight. We extend features previously developed to compactly represent static image textures to describe video textures, such as fabric motion. A discriminatively trained regression model is then used to predict the physical properties of fabric from these features. The success of our model is demonstrated on a new, publicly available database offabric videos with corresponding measured ground truth material properties. We show that our predictions are well correlated with ground truth measurements of stiffness and density for the fabrics. Our contributions include: (a) a database that can be used for training and testing algorithms for passively predicting fabric properties from video, (b) an algorithm for predicting the material properties of fabric from a video, and (c) a perceptual study of humans’ ability to estimate the material properties of fabric from videos and images.</p><p>4 0.62246621 <a title="429-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Segmentation_Driven_Object_Detection_with_Fisher_Vectors.html">377 iccv-2013-Segmentation Driven Object Detection with Fisher Vectors</a></p>

For computational and storage efficiency, we use a recent segmentation-based method to generate class-independent object detection hypotheses, in combination with data compression techniques. Our main contribution is a method to produce tentative object segmentation masks to suppress background clutter in the features. Re-weighting the local image features based on these masks is shown to improve object detection significantly. We also exploit contextual features in the form of a full-image FV descriptor, and an inter-category rescoring mechanism. Our experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2010 datasets show that our detector improves over the current state-of-the-art detection results.</p><p>5 0.61882365 <a title="429-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Monocular_Image_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_under_Self-Occlusion.html">273 iccv-2013-Monocular Image 3D Human Pose Estimation under Self-Occlusion</a></p>
<p>Author: Ibrahim Radwan, Abhinav Dhall, Roland Goecke</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, an automatic approach for 3D pose reconstruction from a single image is proposed. The presence of human body articulation, hallucinated parts and cluttered background leads to ambiguity during the pose inference, which makes the problem non-trivial. Researchers have explored various methods based on motion and shading in order to reduce the ambiguity and reconstruct the 3D pose. The key idea of our algorithm is to impose both kinematic and orientation constraints. The former is imposed by projecting a 3D model onto the input image and pruning the parts, which are incompatible with the anthropomorphism. The latter is applied by creating synthetic views via regressing the input view to multiple oriented views. After applying the constraints, the 3D model is projected onto the initial and synthetic views, which further reduces the ambiguity. Finally, we borrow the direction of the unambiguous parts from the synthetic views to the initial one, which results in the 3D pose. Quantitative experiments are performed on the HumanEva-I dataset and qualitatively on unconstrained images from the Image Parse dataset. The results show the robustness of the proposed approach to accurately reconstruct the 3D pose form a single image.</p><p>6 0.51781255 <a title="429-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Shortest_Paths_with_Curvature_and_Torsion.html">389 iccv-2013-Shortest Paths with Curvature and Torsion</a></p>

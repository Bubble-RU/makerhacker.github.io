</p><p>10 Introduction Solving absolute camera pose, which means determining the position, orientation and possibly intrinsic camera parameters from n 2D-to-3D point correspondences, is known as the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem. [sent-17, score-0.407]
</p><p>11 The PnP problem is one of the oldest problems in computer vision [10] which creates a very basic element of many computer vision applications [22, 16, 15, 18]. [sent-18, score-0.031]
</p><p>12 3D reconstruction obtained using the new solver for the absolute pose problem for camera with unknown radial distortion  and unknown focal length without further bundle adjustment. [sent-23, score-2.194]
</p><p>13 The absolute pose problem for a fully calibrated camera was intensively studied in the past and many solutions were already developed. [sent-25, score-0.496]
</p><p>14 The problem itself can be formulated as a simple system of polynomial equations and solved in a closed form. [sent-26, score-0.242]
</p><p>15 Researchers in the past focused on how to formulate this problem, searched for different solutions, compared numerical stability, speed, or studied how to calculate the camera pose from more than three 2D-to-3D point correspondences [8, 19, 20, 21, 3, 24, 25]. [sent-27, score-0.331]
</p><p>16 Recently, a number of solutions to the absolute pose problems for cameras without complete internal calibration [2, 23, 4, 12, 5] and for cameras where some additional information about the scene is known [14] has been published. [sent-28, score-0.535]
</p><p>17 The reason for this is that in many applications 2816  we do not have calibrated cameras, however, we can make some assumptions about these cameras or about the scene. [sent-29, score-0.109]
</p><p>18 For example, for modern cameras, we can usually assume square pixels and the principal point in the center of the image. [sent-30, score-0.038]
</p><p>19 On the other hand, consumer cameras have some non-negligible radial distortion and variable focal length. [sent-31, score-0.96]
</p><p>20 The problem of estimating absolute pose of a camera together with its focal length for image points without radial distortion was first solved in [2], but only for planar scenes. [sent-32, score-1.492]
</p><p>21 The first solution to this focal length problem, which works for non-planar scenes, was presented by Triggs in [23]. [sent-33, score-0.354]
</p><p>22 The solution is based on multivariate resultants and works for non-planar scenes but fails for the planar ones. [sent-34, score-0.219]
</p><p>23 An efficient solution to the absolute pose problem for camera with unknown focal length working for both planar and non-planar scenes was proposed recently in [4]. [sent-35, score-1.1]
</p><p>24 This solution is based on Euclidean rigidity constraint and for four 2D-to-3D point correspondences results in a system of four polynomial equations in four unknowns, which are solved using the Gr¨ obner basis method [7]. [sent-36, score-0.752]
</p><p>25 The final solver is efficient and useful, however it may produce unsatisfactory results for cameras with radial distortion. [sent-37, score-0.911]
</p><p>26 In [12] authors included the radial distortion to the problem with unknown focal length and proposed a method for solving absolute pose problem for a camera with radial distortion and unknown focal length from four 2D-to-3D point correspondences based on Gr¨ obner bases. [sent-38, score-3.062]
</p><p>27 In experiments, authors show that in many real applications the consideration of radial distortion brings a significant improvement. [sent-39, score-0.73]
</p><p>28 The solution [12] uses one parameter division model for the radial distortion [9] and quaternions to parametrize rotations, and it results in five equations in five unknowns. [sent-40, score-1.232]
</p><p>29 These equations are quite complex and the Gr¨ obner basis method [7] results in a large solver (a 1134 x 720 matrix) with 24 solutions. [sent-41, score-0.838]
</p><p>30 Therefore, this solver is not practical in real-time applications. [sent-43, score-0.452]
</p><p>31 A more practical solution to the absolute pose problem  ×  for a camera with unknown radial distortion and unknown focal length from four 2D-to-3D point correspondences was proposed in [5]. [sent-44, score-1.945]
</p><p>32 By decomposing the problem into a nonplanar and planar case a much simpler and efficient solvers than in [12] were obtained. [sent-45, score-0.365]
</p><p>33 Both planar and non-planar solvers are again based on the Gr¨ obner basis method for solving systems of polynomial equations [7]. [sent-46, score-0.752]
</p><p>34 The solution to the non-planar case requires to perform Gauss-Jordan (GJ) elimination of a 136 152 matrix and the eigenvalue cJo)m elipmutiantiaotino nof o a a16 1 3×6 1×6 1m52atr mixa. [sent-47, score-0.134]

</p><p>37 These two solvers can be joined to a single general solver. [sent-51, score-0.209]
</p><p>38 The joined solver gives comparable or better results than the general solver [12] for most scenes, including the near-planar ones. [sent-52, score-0.969]
</p><p>39 This solver is much faster than the solver [12], however it is still much more complicated than the solvers to the calibrated absolute pose problem [8] or the problem with unknown focal length [4]. [sent-54, score-1.903]
</p><p>40 Moreover, the solver [5] is quite complicated to implement without the special Gr¨ obner basis software [13]. [sent-55, score-0.674]
</p><p>41 In this paper we propose a new solutions to the important absolute pose problem for camera with unknown radial distortion and unknown focal length. [sent-56, score-1.741]
</p><p>42 In this solution we extend the solution proposed in [5]. [sent-57, score-0.076]
</p><p>43 Thanks to having five  ×  2D-to-3D point correspondences we obtain simpler and significantly faster solver that results in less solutions and can handle larger radial distortions than the solvers presented in [5, 12]. [sent-58, score-1.36]
</p><p>44 The new solver can work with up to three parameter division model for radial distortion [9] and provides up to four real solutions. [sent-59, score-1.315]
</p><p>45 It is a minimal solver for three parameter division model, i. [sent-60, score-0.619]
</p><p>46 it uses the minimal number of correspondences needed to solve this problem. [sent-62, score-0.13]
</p><p>47 By evaluating our new solver on synthetic and real data, we show that it is numerically more stable and more accurate than the state-of-the-art solvers [12, 5]. [sent-63, score-0.672]
</p><p>48 Therefore this solver is very useful in real applications where consideration of radial distortion may bring a significant improvement over the absolute pose problems without distortion [8, 4]. [sent-65, score-1.722]
</p><p>49 Problem Formulation Let us assume the standard pinhole camera model [11]. [sent-67, score-0.145]
</p><p>50 In this model the image projection ui of a 3D point Xi can be written as αi ui = P Xi, (1) where P is a 3 4 projection matrix, αi is an unknown scalar value and points ui = [ui,vi, and Xi = [Xi, Yi, Zi, are represented by their homogeneous coordinates. [sent-68, score-0.85]
</p><p>51 ××  3 rotation matrix, t =  is the camera position vector and K is the 3 3 calibration misa ttrhixe coafm mtheer camera. [sent-72, score-0.213]
</p><p>52 We assume that the only unknown parameter from the calibration matrix K is the focal length. [sent-73, score-0.548]
</p><p>53 Therefore, the calibration matrix K has the form diag [f, f, 1] . [sent-74, score-0.151]
</p><p>54 Since the projection matrix is given only up to scale we can equivalently write K = diag [1, 1, w] for w = f1 and the projection matrix (2) has the form  P =⎣⎡wr 1r231 1 wr12 32 wr123 3 wt xyz⎦⎤. [sent-75, score-0.408]
</p><p>55 (3)  28 17  The projection equation (1) holds for the pinhole camera model with no radial distortion. [sent-76, score-0.729]
</p><p>56 However, in real situations we measure image points uˆi affected by some radial distortion. [sent-77, score-0.429]
</p><p>57 To use measured distorted image points uˆi in (1) we need to “undistort” them. [sent-78, score-0.036]
</p><p>58 Therefore, we obtain αi  fu ( uˆi) = P Xi,  (4)  where fu is a function that undistort an image point and αi ∈ R is an unknown scalar value. [sent-79, score-0.607]

</p><p>61 In [17], it was shown that the two-parameter division model may give in some applications better results than the one-parameter division model. [sent-88, score-0.27]
</p><p>62 In our new five point absolute pose solver we can handle up to three parameters for radial distortion without increasing the complexity of the solver. [sent-89, score-1.498]
</p><p>63 We will consider up to three parameter division model of the form  ? [sent-90, score-0.135]
</p><p>64 Now we describe our new solver for the problem of estimating absolute pose of a camera with unknown radial distortion and unknown focal length from five 2D-to-3D point correspondences. [sent-96, score-2.306]
</p><p>65 Absolute pose for a camera with radial distortion and unknown focal length Our new solver follows the formulation used in [5], but the new solver, unlike the solver from [5], works for non-planar as well as for planar scenes. [sent-98, score-2.42]
</p><p>66 While the non-planar P4Pfr solver from [5] assumes regularity of some matrices and therefore fails for planar scenes, our new P5Pfr solver does not make such assumptions and works for both planar and non-planar scenes. [sent-100, score-1.192]
</p><p>67 For planar scenes, a slightly simpler solver can be created but this is not necessary, since the new P5Pfr solver is already very simple, fast and efficient. [sent-101, score-1.096]
</p><p>68 In our new solver we start by eliminating the scalar values αi from the projection equation (4). [sent-102, score-0.685]
</p><p>69 We do this by multiplying (4) by the skew symmetric matrix [fu( uˆi)] . [sent-103, score-0.118]
</p><p>70 Since [fu( uˆi)] fu ( uˆi) = 0 we obtain the matrix equation  × × ⎣⎡− w0ˆ vˆi −ˆu0wˆi − vˆ0 ˆui⎦⎤⎣⎡p p321 1 p 2312 p 231 3 p 2314 ⎤⎦⎢⎡⎣⎢ZXY1i ⎦⎥ ⎤= 0, ⎦(6)  1]? [sent-104, score-0.279]
</p><p>71 where wˆ i = 1+ k1ˆ ri2 + k2ˆ ri4 + k3ˆ ri6, Xi = [Xi, Yi, Zi, and pij is the element from the ith row and jth column of the projection matrix P. [sent-105, score-0.174]
</p><p>72 This matrix equation gives three polynomial equations from which only two are linearly independent. [sent-106, score-0.396]
</p><p>73 This is caused by the fact that the skew symmetric matrix [fu ( uˆi)] has rank two. [sent-107, score-0.118]
</p><p>74 Let’s now consider the equation corresponding to the third row of the matrix equation (6). [sent-108, score-0.239]
</p><p>75 This equation can be written as  ×  −ˆ v i (p11 Xi + p12 Yi + p13 Zi + p14) + + uˆi (p21 Xi p22 Yi p23 Zi p24) 0. [sent-109, score-0.124]
</p><p>76 +  +  +  =  (7)  This is a homogeneous linear equation in eight unknowns  ××  p11,p12,p13,p14,p21,p22, p23 and p24. [sent-110, score-0.264]
</p><p>77 Since we have five 2D-to-3D point correspondences, we have five equations of the form (7). [sent-111, score-0.35]
</p><p>78 These five equations can be rewritten in the matrix form M v = 0,  where  M is a 5  (8)  8 coefficient  matrix and v = i ms a r8ix x× 1n dvec vtor of unknowns. [sent-112, score-0.411]
</p><p>79 Therefore we can write our eight ×un 1k vnoecwtonrs oinf v as a linear combination of the three null space basis vectors ni of the matrix M  [wp1h1e,rpe12 M,p i1s3,p a14, 5p2 ×1,p 822, cpo2e3f,fipc2i4e]n? [sent-113, score-0.2]

</p><p>85 These two equations can be written as quadratic equations in only one unknown γ1 and with polynomial coefficients in γ2. [sent-127, score-0.642]

<p>Author: Yubin Kuang, Kalle Åström</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the geometry problems of estimating camera pose with unknown focal length using combination of geometric primitives. We consider points, lines and also rich features such as quivers, i.e. points with one or more directions. We formulate the problems as polynomial systems where the constraints for different primitives are handled in a unified way. We develop efficient polynomial solvers for each of the derived cases with different combinations of primitives. The availability of these solvers enables robust pose estimation with unknown focal length for wider classes of features. Such rich features allow for fewer feature correspondences and generate larger inlier sets with higher probability. We demonstrate in synthetic experiments that our solvers are fast and numerically stable. For real images, we show that our solvers can be used in RANSAC loops to provide good initial solutions.</p><p>3 0.22850381 <a title="342-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_3D_Reconstruction_from_Uncalibrated_Radially-Symmetric_Cameras.html">280 iccv-2013-Multi-view 3D Reconstruction from Uncalibrated Radially-Symmetric Cameras</a></p>

We formulate the problem of multi-view reconstruction for radial 1D cameras as a matrix rank minimization problem. Efficient implementation based on alternating direction continuation is proposed to handle scalability issue for real-world applications. Our method applies to a wide range of omnidirectional cameras including both dioptric and catadioptric (central and non-central) cameras. Additionally, our method deals with complete and incomplete measurements under a unified framework elegantly. Experiments on both synthetic and real images from various types of cameras validate the superior performance of our new method, in terms of numerical accuracy and robustness.</p><p>4 0.19076987 <a title="342-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Intrinsic_Calibration_from_a_Single_Frame_Using_a_%22Plumb-Line%22_Approach.html">436 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Intrinsic Calibration from a Single Frame Using a "Plumb-Line" Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: R. Melo, M. Antunes, J.P. Barreto, G. Falcão, N. Gonçalves</p><p>Abstract: Estimating the amount and center ofdistortionfrom lines in the scene has been addressed in the literature by the socalled “plumb-line ” approach. In this paper we propose a new geometric method to estimate not only the distortion parameters but the entire camera calibration (up to an “angular” scale factor) using a minimum of 3 lines. We propose a new framework for the unsupervised simultaneous detection of natural image of lines and camera parameters estimation, enabling a robust calibration from a single image. Comparative experiments with existing automatic approaches for the distortion estimation and with ground truth data are presented.</p><p>5 0.18175904 <a title="342-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Robust_Analytical_Solution_to_Isometric_Shape-from-Template_with_Focal_Length_Calibration.html">27 iccv-2013-A Robust Analytical Solution to Isometric Shape-from-Template with Focal Length Calibration</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrien Bartoli, Daniel Pizarro, Toby Collins</p><p>Abstract: We study the uncalibrated isometric Shape-fromTemplate problem, that consists in estimating an isometric deformation from a template shape to an input image whose focal length is unknown. Our method is the first that combines the following features: solving for both the 3D deformation and the camera ’s focal length, involving only local analytical solutions (there is no numerical optimization), being robust to mismatches, handling general surfaces and running extremely fast. This was achieved through two key steps. First, an ‘uncalibrated’ 3D deformation is computed thanks to a novel piecewise weak-perspective projection model. Second, the camera’s focal length is estimated and enables upgrading the 3D deformation to metric. We use a variational framework, implemented using a smooth function basis and sampled local deformation models. The only degeneracy which we easily detect– for focal length estimation is a flat and fronto-parallel surface. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets show that our method achieves a 3D shape accuracy – slightly below state of the art methods using a precalibrated or the true focal length, and a focal length accuracy slightly below static calibration methods.</p><p>6 0.17973644 <a title="342-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Revisiting_the_PnP_Problem%3A_A_Fast%2C_General_and_Optimal_Solution.html">353 iccv-2013-Revisiting the PnP Problem: A Fast, General and Optimal Solution</a></p>

In this paper we present a new solution to the absolute pose problem for camera with unknown radial distortion and unknown focal length from five 2D-to-3D point correspondences. Our new solver is numerically more stable, more accurate, and significantly faster than the existing state-of-the-art minimal fourpoint absolutepose solvers for this problem. Moreover, our solver results in less solutions and can handle larger radial distortions. The new solver is straightforward and uses only simple concepts from linear algebra.

<p>Author: Yubin Kuang, Kalle Åström</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the geometry problems of estimating camera pose with unknown focal length using combination of geometric primitives. We consider points, lines and also rich features such as quivers, i.e. points with one or more directions. We formulate the problems as polynomial systems where the constraints for different primitives are handled in a unified way. We develop efficient polynomial solvers for each of the derived cases with different combinations of primitives. The availability of these solvers enables robust pose estimation with unknown focal length for wider classes of features. Such rich features allow for fewer feature correspondences and generate larger inlier sets with higher probability. We demonstrate in synthetic experiments that our solvers are fast and numerically stable. For real images, we show that our solvers can be used in RANSAC loops to provide good initial solutions.</p><p>3 0.81257355 <a title="342-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Robust_Analytical_Solution_to_Isometric_Shape-from-Template_with_Focal_Length_Calibration.html">27 iccv-2013-A Robust Analytical Solution to Isometric Shape-from-Template with Focal Length Calibration</a></p>

<p>Author: Yinqiang Zheng, Yubin Kuang, Shigeki Sugimoto, Kalle Åström, Masatoshi Okutomi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the classical perspective-n-point (PnP) problem, and propose the first non-iterative O(n) solution that is fast, generally applicable and globally optimal. Our basic idea is to formulate the PnP problem into a functional minimization problem and retrieve all its stationary points by using the Gr¨ obner basis technique. The novelty lies in a non-unit quaternion representation to parameterize the rotation and a simple but elegant formulation of the PnP problem into an unconstrained optimization problem. Interestingly, the polynomial system arising from its first-order optimality condition assumes two-fold symmetry, a nice property that can be utilized to improve speed and numerical stability of a Gr¨ obner basis solver. Experiment results have demonstrated that, in terms of accuracy, our proposed solution is definitely better than the state-ofthe-art O(n) methods, and even comparable with the reprojection error minimization method.</p><p>5 0.76410538 <a title="342-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Intrinsic_Calibration_from_a_Single_Frame_Using_a_%22Plumb-Line%22_Approach.html">436 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Intrinsic Calibration from a Single Frame Using a "Plumb-Line" Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Tae-Hyun Oh, Hyeongwoo Kim, Yu-Wing Tai, Jean-Charles Bazin, In So Kweon</p><p>Abstract: Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) via rank minimization is a powerful tool for recovering underlying low-rank structure of clean data corrupted with sparse noise/outliers. In many low-level vision problems, not only it is known that the underlying structure of clean data is low-rank, but the exact rank of clean data is also known. Yet, when applying conventional rank minimization for those problems, the objective function is formulated in a way that does not fully utilize a priori target rank information about the problems. This observation motivates us to investigate whether there is a better alternative solution when using rank minimization. In this paper, instead of minimizing the nuclear norm, we propose to minimize the partial sum of singular values. The proposed objective function implicitly encourages the target rank constraint in rank minimization. Our experimental analyses show that our approach performs better than conventional rank minimization when the number of samples is deficient, while the solutions obtained by the two approaches are almost identical when the number of samples is more than sufficient. We apply our approach to various low-level vision problems, e.g. high dynamic range imaging, photometric stereo and image alignment, and show that our results outperform those obtained by the conventional nuclear norm rank minimization method.</p><p>4 0.63036871 <a title="342-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic-Aware_Co-indexing_for_Image_Retrieval.html">378 iccv-2013-Semantic-Aware Co-indexing for Image Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Shiliang Zhang, Ming Yang, Xiaoyu Wang, Yuanqing Lin, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: Inverted indexes in image retrieval not only allow fast access to database images but also summarize all knowledge about the database, so that their discriminative capacity largely determines the retrieval performance. In this paper, for vocabulary tree based image retrieval, we propose a semantic-aware co-indexing algorithm to jointly San Antonio, TX 78249 . j dl@gmai l com qit ian@cs .ut sa . edu . The query embed two strong cues into the inverted indexes: 1) local invariant features that are robust to delineate low-level image contents, and 2) semantic attributes from large-scale object recognition that may reveal image semantic meanings. For an initial set of inverted indexes of local features, we utilize 1000 semantic attributes to filter out isolated images and insert semantically similar images to the initial set. Encoding these two distinct cues together effectively enhances the discriminative capability of inverted indexes. Such co-indexing operations are totally off-line and introduce small computation overhead to online query cause only local features but no semantic attributes are used for query. Experiments and comparisons with recent retrieval methods on 3 datasets, i.e., UKbench, Holidays, Oxford5K, and 1.3 million images from Flickr as distractors, manifest the competitive performance of our method 1.</p><p>5 0.62059748 <a title="342-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-An_Adaptive_Descriptor_Design_for_Object_Recognition_in_the_Wild.html">48 iccv-2013-An Adaptive Descriptor Design for Object Recognition in the Wild</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenyu Guo, Z. Jane Wang</p><p>Abstract: Digital images nowadays show large appearance variabilities on picture styles, in terms of color tone, contrast, vignetting, and etc. These ‘picture styles’ are directly related to the scene radiance, image pipeline of the camera, and post processing functions (e.g., photography effect filters). Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of these factors, popular gradient-based image descriptors generally are not invariant to different picture styles, which could degrade the performance for object recognition. Given that images shared online or created by individual users are taken with a wide range of devices and may be processed by various post processing functions, to find a robust object recognition system is useful and challenging. In this paper, we investigate the influence of picture styles on object recognition by making a connection between image descriptors and a pixel mapping function g, and accordingly propose an adaptive approach based on a g-incorporated kernel descriptor and multiple kernel learning, without estimating or specifying the image styles used in training and testing. We conduct experiments on the Domain Adaptation data set, the Oxford Flower data set, and several variants of the Flower data set by introducing popular photography effects through post-processing. The results demonstrate that theproposedmethod consistently yields recognition improvements over standard descriptors in all studied cases.</p><p>6 0.59740692 <a title="342-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Transfer_Feature_Learning_with_Joint_Distribution_Adaptation.html">427 iccv-2013-Transfer Feature Learning with Joint Distribution Adaptation</a></p>

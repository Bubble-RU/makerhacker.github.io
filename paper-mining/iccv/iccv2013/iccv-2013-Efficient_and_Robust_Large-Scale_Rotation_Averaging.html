</p><p>7 Introduction In this paper we address the problem of robust averaging of 3D relative rotations in the context of structure-frommotion (henceforth SfM) estimation. [sent-17, score-0.684]
</p><p>8 The canonical SfM solution of nonlinear bundle adjustment that minimizes reprojection error is statistically optimal [15]. [sent-18, score-0.15]
</p><p>9 Such pipelines need to robustly handle outliers that may exist in unstructured image datasets harvested from the internet. [sent-20, score-0.205]
</p><p>10 Given the high dimensional optimization involved and the presence of outliers, successful convergence critically depends on both a good initial guess as well as the robustness of the optimization methods used. [sent-21, score-0.125]
</p><p>11 This is often achieved by incremental bundle adjustment that robustly grows the solution one image at a time instead of carrying out a single batch optimization. [sent-22, score-0.208]
</p><p>12 Motion Averaging Preliminaries In contrast to bundle adjustment, an alternate approach for global camera motion estimation is to average relative motions. [sent-24, score-0.244]
</p><p>13 Motion averaging was introduced in [5] and further developed in [6] to use the geometric structure of Lie  × ×  groups. [sent-25, score-0.242]
</p><p>14 While such a formulation is generic enough to apply to a variety of scenarios, in the context of SfM, motion averaging leverages the observation that in a set of N images, there exist as many as NC2 = pairs for which the relative motions can be estimated. [sent-26, score-0.348]
</p><p>15 We can represent the relationships between all the cameras by means of a graph G = {V, E} known as the viewgraph where each vertex in VG represents a camera athned an edge (hi, w wjh) r∈e eEa implies txh iant tVhe r emproetisoenn bse atw caeemne cameras ni eadngde j can b ∈e eEst i mmpalteieds.

</p><p>19 , SO(3) is a Lie group which is the basis for an efficient approach for averaging rotations. [sent-36, score-0.278]
</p><p>20 An important property of Lie groups is the existence of direct mappings between the Lie algebra and the group and vice-versa. [sent-42, score-0.15]

</p><p>22 Analogous to estimating the mean rotation, we may use the intrinsic distance to fit global or absolute rotations to a given set of relative rotation observations. [sent-52, score-0.634]
</p><p>23 If with respect to a given frame of reference, we define the global rotations as Rglobal = {R1, · · · , RN}, using Eqn. [sent-53, score-0.345]
</p><p>24 2 We further denote the angle representations of all the rotations as ωglobal = [ω1, Consequently, we can write  ωij  =  ωj  − ωi  = ? [sent-56, score-0.316]

</p><p>27 Following this averaged estimate (step 3), the individual rotations are updated by mapping the Lie algebraic update back to the rotation group via the exponential mapping. [sent-96, score-0.666]
</p><p>28 It may be further noted that following the averaging in the Lie algebra, the exponential mapping used to update individual rotations (step 4) ensures that at every point, the estimates are on the rotation manifold, i. [sent-97, score-0.848]
</p><p>29 this algorithm provides an intrinsic estimate for the global rotation Rglobal . [sent-99, score-0.259]
</p><p>30 We also note that in practice the rotation for any camera is fixed to I remove the gauge freedom of Rglobal. [sent-100, score-0.206]
</p><p>31 to This method of averaging relative rotations can solve for the global rotation of all cameras in an efficient manner, see [6] for details. [sent-101, score-0.888]
</p><p>32 In the context of SfM, given camera calibration information and a sufficient number of point correspondences between images iand j, we can estimate Rij either from the epipolar geometry or bundle adjustment between the two images. [sent-102, score-0.19]
</p><p>33 In [12], 522  the authors use relative rotation estimates and information from vanishing point matches to estimate Rglobal . [sent-104, score-0.348]
</p><p>34 In [11], the authors use rotation averaging in a RANSAC frame-  work to robustly estimate the global rotations. [sent-105, score-0.558]
</p><p>35 [4] uses a dual formulation on a quaterion representation for rotation averaging while [9] provides a survey on rotation averaging. [sent-106, score-0.608]
</p><p>36 Although this method can efficiently average relative motions, as is well known least squares solutions are non-robust and can give highly erroneous results in the presence of even a single outlier. [sent-113, score-0.191]
</p><p>37 The problem can be mitigated to some extent by ensuring that the individual relative rotation estimates Rij are robustly estimated, e. [sent-115, score-0.381]
</p><p>38 In other words, in many contexts the presence of outliers cannot be fully avoided or it can be prohibitively expensive to remove them. [sent-119, score-0.114]
</p><p>39 In effect, modern SfM systems need a rotation averaging scheme that is efficient, scalable and robust to outliers in the relative rotations. [sent-121, score-0.609]
</p><p>40 Existing Methods In recent years a few methods have been developed to incorporate robustness into the averaging of relative rotations and they can be classified into two approaches. [sent-124, score-0.645]
</p><p>41 Some methods detect outliers in the set of relative rotations and remove them before carrying out ? [sent-125, score-0.501]
</p><p>42 In [18], the authors utilize the fact that a loop of transformations should result in the identity transformation if there is no noise or outliers in the loop. [sent-129, score-0.109]
</p><p>43 The second category of methods robustly average relative rotations without the need to explicitly detect and remove outliers. [sent-133, score-0.455]
</p><p>44 In [3], the authors use  a combination of discrete-continuous optimization (henceforth DISCO) to average relative rotations in a robust manner. [sent-135, score-0.466]
</p><p>45 j)∈E (6) where the additional prior terms include information from other sensor measurements that provide an approximate estimate for individual rotations in Rglobal . [sent-138, score-0.377]
</p><p>46 Ignoring the twist component of rotations, [3] parametrizes rotations as a discrete set of labels on a unit sphere. [sent-141, score-0.36]
</p><p>47 The resultant averaging problem in the discrete labelling form is solved using discrete loopy belief propagation on a Markov Random Field. [sent-142, score-0.304]
</p><p>48 not directly lend itself to the averaging of relative rotations. [sent-156, score-0.329]
</p><p>49 To work around this  limitation, [8] updates individual rotations one-at-a-time while holding all other rotation estimates fixed. [sent-157, score-0.558]
</p><p>50 If we hold all rotations in Rglobal fixed except for Rj, then the Weiszfeld optimization reduces to the ? [sent-158, score-0.316]
</p><p>51 1 average of the rotations Rj = {RijRi |∀i ∈ N(j)} where N(j) is the sroett otifo vnesr tRices= =co {nRnected| ∀toi v ∈er tNex( j. [sent-159, score-0.316]
</p><p>52 Thus, in [8], Rglobal is indirectly eelstdim-baasteedd using nne ostfe Rd iteration where the inner loop consists of updating Rj to the Weiszfeld median of Rj and the outer loop is iterated till convergence. [sent-161, score-0.135]
</p><p>53 Although the methods of DISCO [3] and Weiszfeld [8] solve the problem of robust averaging of relative rotations, they suffer from significant limitations. [sent-163, score-0.368]
</p><p>54 DISCO [3] can handle large-scale averaging problems but at a significant cost of implementational and computational complexity. [sent-164, score-0.242]
</p><p>55 More crucially, disregarding the geometric structure of SO(3) and treating averaging as a complicated discrete labelling MRF problem makes DISCO an extremely expensive problem requiring a significant amount of hardware. [sent-169, score-0.284]
</p><p>56 Since the Weiszfeld method cannot update all rotations in Rglobal simultaneously, it is forced to update the rotation of each camera (i. [sent-172, score-0.568]
</p><p>57 1 Rotation Averaging Since neither DISCO [3] nor the Weiszfeld method [8] satisfies both the requirements of a computationally efficient and scalable robust averaging scheme, we propose an alternate approach that can efficiently handle large-scale problems. [sent-185, score-0.304]
</p><p>58 4, we recognise that if a specific relative rotation is an outlier, then an ? [sent-187, score-0.27]
</p><p>59 2 average in the Lie algebra will result in wrong rotation estimates. [sent-188, score-0.265]
</p><p>60 The  remedy lies in robust Lie algebraic averaging so that at each iteration the averaging step in the Lie algebra is robust. [sent-189, score-0.627]
</p><p>61 As the Lie algebra is a vector space, our problem of robust averaging in the Lie algebra is analogous to robust estimation for a linear system of equations. [sent-193, score-0.484]
</p><p>62 Recent work in compressive sensing [2] has shown that we can efficiently and accurately estimate x in the presence of outliers by solving argmxin ||Ax − b||? [sent-200, score-0.121]
</p><p>63 If we consider the presence of outliers in the observed relative rotations in the Lie algebra  at any given iteration, we have Δωrel = AΔωglobal + e. [sent-208, score-0.578]
</p><p>64 1 robust rotation averaging method (denoted as L1RA) can be stated as Algorithm 1 where step 3 is solved as the minimizer of | |AΔωglobal Δωrel | |? [sent-210, score-0.483]
</p><p>65 Here Δωglobal ∈ R3|V| and Δωrel ∈ R3|E| since each rotation angle i∈s a 3-vector. [sent-213, score-0.183]
</p><p>66 1 rotation average estimate in the presence of outliers, we can further improve this solution by treating the problem of robust rotation averaging as one of robust regression or M-estimator modifications of least squares estimation. [sent-221, score-0.818]
</p><p>67 Since the observations of relative rotations are corrupted by the presence of outliers, we take recourse to robust estimation using the ? [sent-225, score-0.477]
</p><p>68 1 minimization is accurate enough, the fitting error for individual relative rotations gives us a good estimate of the reliability of the input Rij . [sent-229, score-0.517]
</p><p>69 We utilise this information to iteratively solve for a robust weighted least squares averaging of the relative rotations. [sent-230, score-0.457]

</p><p>71 Since our L1RA method is efficient and provides a good estimate of Rglobal we use its output as the initial guess for robust rotation averaging using the IRLS estimator. [sent-270, score-0.552]
</p><p>72 We can now state our complete robust rotation averaging algorithm (denoted as L1-IRLS) in terms of the steps in Algorithm 1 as Algorithm 3. [sent-271, score-0.464]
</p><p>73 The Notre Dame dataset is available as raw images4 and for the Quad dataset, relative rotations Rij have been provided by the authors of [3]5. [sent-282, score-0.427]
</p><p>74 In both cases, the results of bundle adjustment are provided with the datasets and serve as ground truth for all experiments in this Section. [sent-283, score-0.137]
</p><p>75 For the Notre Dame dataset, we estimate relative rotations by running two-frame bundle adjustment on image pairs using the bundler [13] software. [sent-284, score-0.547]
</p><p>76 In Table 1, we have also indicated the number of cameras (V) and number of relative rotations Rij (E) ofofr c baomthe rdaasta (sVe)ts. [sent-285, score-0.468]
</p><p>77 For the results in Table 1, both these methods terminate when the maximum change of rotations in Rglobal between iterations is less than a threshold of ? [sent-288, score-0.367]
</p><p>78 Instead, running the L1RA method for 5 iterations is sufficient to bring the estimate of Rglobal within the basin of convergence of the IRLS step. [sent-291, score-0.109]
</p><p>79 Note that the median error and computational time for DISCO are reproduced from [3] and datasets provided by the authors and that their results were obtained on a computer that is substantially more powerful than ours. [sent-301, score-0.138]
</p><p>80 For the Quad dataset, the Weiszfeld method does poorly and has a high median error of 6. [sent-319, score-0.116]
</p><p>81 Even with this significant difference in computational power, for the Quad dataset our L1-IRLS averaging method is twice as accurate and is an order of magnitude faster. [sent-337, score-0.242]
</p><p>82 Error Distribution: Although we have used the median error as our basis of comparison in Table 1, for a more detailed analysis of relative performance we need to use statistics instead of a single number. [sent-339, score-0.18]

</p><p>84 Note that the scale for the iterations (x-  axis) is logarithmic and the number of iterations does not reflect the time taken for the different methods. [sent-348, score-0.137]
</p><p>85 The comparative performance in terms of median error is better represented here as we can observe that the Weiszfeld method of [8] does poorly with a widely spread distribution of error values. [sent-357, score-0.15]
</p><p>86 It will also be noticed that apart from a large spread of errors, the Weiszfeld method also has two minor peaks in the distribution for very high rotation errors. [sent-358, score-0.214]

</p><p>89 As in precision-recall curves, the better method has  a higher curve implying that a larger number of rotation estimates have better accuracy than a given error bound of θ. [sent-366, score-0.262]
</p><p>90 1(c) we show the convergence behavior of the Weiszfeld method of [8] and our methods by plotting the median error as a function of the iteration number. [sent-379, score-0.123]
</p><p>91 Note that the scale for the iterations is logarithmic as the Weiszfeld method takes 1271 iterations to converge while our methods converge in far fewer iterations. [sent-380, score-0.181]
</p><p>92 1(c), the iterations at which all the methods meet the termination criterion are indicated by dots on the respective convergence curves. [sent-382, score-0.135]
</p><p>93 The comparative behaviour of the convergence curves is demonstrable evidence that the Weiszfeld update is unsuitable for large graphs and we should use a joint update of all rotations as is done by our methods. [sent-387, score-0.392]
</p><p>94 3D Reconstruction: Finally, as an illustration of the correctness of our robust rotation averaging, we carry out a full 3D reconstruction of the Notre Dame dataset using our rotation estimate. [sent-388, score-0.433]

<p>Author: Avishek Chatterjee, Venu Madhav Govindu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of robust and efficient averaging of relative 3D rotations. Apart from having an interesting geometric structure, robust rotation averaging addresses the need for a good initialization for largescale optimization used in structure-from-motion pipelines. Such pipelines often use unstructured image datasets harvested from the internet thereby requiring an initialization method that is robust to outliers. Our approach works on the Lie group structure of 3D rotations and solves the problem of large-scale robust rotation averaging in two ways. Firstly, we use modern ?1 optimizers to carry out robust averaging of relative rotations that is efficient, scalable and robust to outliers. In addition, we also develop a twostep method that uses the ?1 solution as an initialisation for an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach. These methods achieve excellent results on large-scale, real world datasets and significantly outperform existing methods, i.e. the state-of-the-art discrete-continuous optimization method of [3] as well as the Weiszfeld method of [8]. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two large- scale real world datasets and also provide the results of the two aforementioned methods for comparison.</p><p>2 0.20919229 <a title="138-tfidf-2" href="./iccv-2013-Global_Fusion_of_Relative_Motions_for_Robust%2C_Accurate_and_Scalable_Structure_from_Motion.html">184 iccv-2013-Global Fusion of Relative Motions for Robust, Accurate and Scalable Structure from Motion</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Moulon, Pascal Monasse, Renaud Marlet</p><p>Abstract: Multi-view structure from motion (SfM) estimates the position and orientation of pictures in a common 3D coordinate frame. When views are treated incrementally, this external calibration can be subject to drift, contrary to global methods that distribute residual errors evenly. We propose a new global calibration approach based on the fusion of relative motions between image pairs. We improve an existing method for robustly computing global rotations. We present an efficient a contrario trifocal tensor estimation method, from which stable and precise translation directions can be extracted. We also define an efficient translation registration method that recovers accurate camera positions. These components are combined into an original SfM pipeline. Our experiments show that, on most datasets, it outperforms in accuracy other existing incremental and global pipelines. It also achieves strikingly good running times: it is about 20 times faster than the other global method we could compare to, and as fast as the best incremental method. More importantly, it features better scalability properties.</p><p>3 0.13180658 <a title="138-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Kneip, Simon Lynen</p><p>Abstract: This work makes use of a novel, recently proposed epipolar constraint for computing the relative pose between two calibrated images. By enforcing the coplanarity of epipolar plane normal vectors, it constrains the three degrees of freedom of the relative rotation between two camera views directly—independently of the translation. The present paper shows how the approach can be extended to n points, and translated into an efficient eigenvalue minimization over the three rotational degrees of freedom. Each iteration in the non-linear optimization has constant execution time, independently of the number of features. Two global optimization approaches are proposed. The first one consists of an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt scheme with randomized initial value, which already leads to stable and accurate results. The second scheme consists of a globally optimal branch-and-bound algorithm based on a bound on the eigenvalue variation derived from symmetric eigenvalue-perturbation theory. Analysis of the cost function reveals insights into the nature of a specific relative pose problem, and outlines the complexity under different conditions. The algorithm shows state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. essential-matrix based solutions, and a frameto-frame application to a video sequence immediately leads to an alternative, real-time visual odometry solution.

<p>Author: Nianjuan Jiang, Zhaopeng Cui, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We present a linear method for global camera pose registration from pairwise relative poses encoded in essential matrices. Our method minimizes an approximate geometric error to enforce the triangular relationship in camera triplets. This formulation does not suffer from the typical ‘unbalanced scale ’ problem in linear methods relying on pairwise translation direction constraints, i.e. an algebraic error; nor the system degeneracy from collinear motion. In the case of three cameras, our method provides a good linear approximation of the trifocal tensor. It can be directly scaled up to register multiple cameras. The results obtained are accurate for point triangulation and can serve as a good initialization for final bundle adjustment. We evaluate the algorithm performance with different types of data and demonstrate its effectiveness. Our system produces good accuracy, robustness, and outperforms some well-known systems on efficiency.</p><p>6 0.097183637 <a title="138-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-SUN3D%3A_A_Database_of_Big_Spaces_Reconstructed_Using_SfM_and_Object_Labels.html">367 iccv-2013-SUN3D: A Database of Big Spaces Reconstructed Using SfM and Object Labels</a></p>

<p>Author: Avishek Chatterjee, Venu Madhav Govindu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of robust and efficient averaging of relative 3D rotations. Apart from having an interesting geometric structure, robust rotation averaging addresses the need for a good initialization for largescale optimization used in structure-from-motion pipelines. Such pipelines often use unstructured image datasets harvested from the internet thereby requiring an initialization method that is robust to outliers. Our approach works on the Lie group structure of 3D rotations and solves the problem of large-scale robust rotation averaging in two ways. Firstly, we use modern ?1 optimizers to carry out robust averaging of relative rotations that is efficient, scalable and robust to outliers. In addition, we also develop a twostep method that uses the ?1 solution as an initialisation for an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach. These methods achieve excellent results on large-scale, real world datasets and significantly outperform existing methods, i.e. the state-of-the-art discrete-continuous optimization method of [3] as well as the Weiszfeld method of [8]. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two large- scale real world datasets and also provide the results of the two aforementioned methods for comparison.</p><p>2 0.84929019 <a title="138-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-Global_Fusion_of_Relative_Motions_for_Robust%2C_Accurate_and_Scalable_Structure_from_Motion.html">184 iccv-2013-Global Fusion of Relative Motions for Robust, Accurate and Scalable Structure from Motion</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Moulon, Pascal Monasse, Renaud Marlet</p><p>Abstract: Multi-view structure from motion (SfM) estimates the position and orientation of pictures in a common 3D coordinate frame. When views are treated incrementally, this external calibration can be subject to drift, contrary to global methods that distribute residual errors evenly. We propose a new global calibration approach based on the fusion of relative motions between image pairs. We improve an existing method for robustly computing global rotations. We present an efficient a contrario trifocal tensor estimation method, from which stable and precise translation directions can be extracted. We also define an efficient translation registration method that recovers accurate camera positions. These components are combined into an original SfM pipeline. Our experiments show that, on most datasets, it outperforms in accuracy other existing incremental and global pipelines. It also achieves strikingly good running times: it is about 20 times faster than the other global method we could compare to, and as fast as the best incremental method.

<p>Author: Naman Turakhia, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: When we look at an image, some properties or attributes of the image stand out more than others. When describing an image, people are likely to describe these dominant attributes first. Attribute dominance is a result of a complex interplay between the various properties present or absent in the image. Which attributes in an image are more dominant than others reveals rich information about the content of the image. In this paper we tap into this information by modeling attribute dominance. We show that this helps improve the performance of vision systems on a variety of human-centric applications such as zero-shot learning, image search and generating textual descriptions of images.</p><p>2 0.88431996 <a title="138-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-How_Do_You_Tell_a_Blackbird_from_a_Crow%3F.html">202 iccv-2013-How Do You Tell a Blackbird from a Crow?</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Berg, Peter N. Belhumeur</p><p>Abstract: How do you tell a blackbirdfrom a crow? There has been great progress toward automatic methods for visual recognition, including fine-grained visual categorization in which the classes to be distinguished are very similar. In a task such as bird species recognition, automatic recognition systems can now exceed the performance of non-experts – most people are challenged to name a couple dozen bird species, let alone identify them. This leads us to the question, “Can a recognition system show humans what to look for when identifying classes (in this case birds)? ” In the context of fine-grained visual categorization, we show that we can automatically determine which classes are most visually similar, discover what visual features distinguish very similar classes, and illustrate the key features in a way meaningful to humans. Running these methods on a dataset of bird images, we can generate a visual field guide to birds which includes a tree of similarity that displays the similarity relations between all species, pages for each species showing the most similar other species, and pages for each pair of similar species illustrating their differences.</p><p>3 0.86168295 <a title="138-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-scale_Topological_Features_for_Hand_Posture_Representation_and_Analysis.html">278 iccv-2013-Multi-scale Topological Features for Hand Posture Representation and Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Kaoning Hu, Lijun Yin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-scale topological feature representation for automatic analysis of hand posture. Such topological features have the advantage of being posture-dependent while being preserved under certain variations of illumination, rotation, personal dependency, etc. Our method studies the topology of the holes between the hand region and its convex hull. Inspired by the principle of Persistent Homology, which is the theory of computational topology for topological feature analysis over multiple scales, we construct the multi-scale Betti Numbers matrix (MSBNM) for the topological feature representation. In our experiments, we used 12 different hand postures and compared our features with three popular features (HOG, MCT, and Shape Context) on different data sets. In addition to hand postures, we also extend the feature representations to arm postures. The results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method.</p><p>4 0.84894073 <a title="138-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Faces_Guided_Sparse_Many-to-One_Encoder_for_Pose-Invariant_Face_Recognition.html">335 iccv-2013-Random Faces Guided Sparse Many-to-One Encoder for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Yizhe Zhang, Ming Shao, Edward K. Wong, Yun Fu</p><p>Abstract: One of the most challenging task in face recognition is to identify people with varied poses. Namely, the test faces have significantly different poses compared with the registered faces. In this paper, we propose a high-level feature learning scheme to extract pose-invariant identity feature for face recognition. First, we build a single-hiddenlayer neural network with sparse constraint, to extractposeinvariant feature in a supervised fashion. Second, we further enhance the discriminative capability of the proposed feature by using multiple random faces as the target values for multiple encoders. By enforcing the target values to be uniquefor inputfaces over differentposes, the learned highlevel feature that is represented by the neurons in the hidden layer is pose free and only relevant to the identity information. Finally, we conduct face identification on CMU MultiPIE, and verification on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) databases, where identification rank-1 accuracy and face verification accuracy with ROC curve are reported. These experiments demonstrate that our model is superior to oth- er state-of-the-art approaches on handling pose variations.</p><p>5 0.83625191 <a title="138-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Box_in_the_Box%3A_Joint_3D_Layout_and_Object_Reasoning_from_Single_Images.html">64 iccv-2013-Box in the Box: Joint 3D Layout and Object Reasoning from Single Images</a></p>

Towards this goal, we propose a branch and bound algorithm which is guaranteed to retrieve the global optimum of the joint problem. The main difficulty resides in taking into account occlusion in order to not over-count the evidence. We introduce a new decomposition method, which generalizes integral geometry to triangular shapes, and allows us to bound the different terms in constant time. We exploit both geometric cues and object detectors as image features and show large improvements in 2D and 3D object detection over state-of-the-art deformable part-based models.</p><p>6 0.83154881 <a title="138-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Data_Association%3A_Bayesian_Model_Selection_for_Multi-target_Tracking.html">230 iccv-2013-Latent Data Association: Bayesian Model Selection for Multi-target Tracking</a></p>

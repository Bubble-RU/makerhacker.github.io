<p>Author: Aditya Khosla, Wilma A. Bainbridge, Antonio Torralba, Aude Oliva</p><p>Abstract: Contemporary life bombards us with many new images of faces every day, which poses non-trivial constraints on human memory. The vast majority of face photographs are intended to be remembered, either because of personal relevance, commercial interests or because the pictures were deliberately designed to be memorable. Can we make aportrait more memorable or more forgettable automatically? Here, we provide a method to modify the memorability of individual face photographs, while keeping the identity and other facial traits (e.g. age, attractiveness, and emotional magnitude) of the individual fixed. We show that face photographs manipulated to be more memorable (or more forgettable) are indeed more often remembered (or forgotten) in a crowd-sourcing experiment with an accuracy of 74%. Quantifying and modifying the ‘memorability ’ of a face lends itself to many useful applications in computer vision and graphics, such as mnemonic aids for learning, photo editing applications for social networks and tools for designing memorable advertisements.</p><p>3 0.12172013 <a title="416-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_to_Predict_Gaze_in_Egocentric_Video.html">247 iccv-2013-Learning to Predict Gaze in Egocentric Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Yin Li, Alireza Fathi, James M. Rehg</p><p>Abstract: We present a model for gaze prediction in egocentric video by leveraging the implicit cues that exist in camera wearer’s behaviors. Specifically, we compute the camera wearer’s head motion and hand location from the video and combine them to estimate where the eyes look. We further model the dynamic behavior of the gaze, in particular fixations, as latent variables to improve the gaze prediction. Our gaze prediction results outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin on publicly available egocentric vision datasets. In addition, we demonstrate that we get a significant performance boost in recognizing daily actions and segmenting foreground objects by plugging in our gaze predictions into state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.11036806 <a title="416-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic_Transform%3A_Weakly_Supervised_Semantic_Inference_for_Relating_Visual_Attributes.html">380 iccv-2013-Semantic Transform: Weakly Supervised Semantic Inference for Relating Visual Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Sukrit Shankar, Joan Lasenby, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: Relative (comparative) attributes are promising for thematic ranking of visual entities, which also aids in recognition tasks [19, 23]. However, attribute rank learning often requires a substantial amount of relational supervision, which is highly tedious, and apparently impracticalfor realworld applications. In this paper, we introduce the Semantic Transform, which under minimal supervision, adaptively finds a semantic feature space along with a class ordering that is related in the best possible way. Such a semantic space is found for every attribute category. To relate the classes under weak supervision, the class ordering needs to be refined according to a cost function in an iterative procedure. This problem is ideally NP-hard, and we thus propose a constrained search tree formulation for the same. Driven by the adaptive semantic feature space representation, our model achieves the best results to date for all of the tasks of relative, absolute and zero-shot classification on two popular datasets.</p><p>5 0.1096765 <a title="416-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Heterogeneous_Image_Features_Integration_via_Multi-modal_Semi-supervised_Learning_Model.html">194 iccv-2013-Heterogeneous Image Features Integration via Multi-modal Semi-supervised Learning Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao Cai, Feiping Nie, Weidong Cai, Heng Huang</p><p>Abstract: Automatic image categorization has become increasingly important with the development of Internet and the growth in the size of image databases. Although the image categorization can be formulated as a typical multiclass classification problem, two major challenges have been raised by the real-world images. On one hand, though using more labeled training data may improve the prediction performance, obtaining the image labels is a time consuming as well as biased process. On the other hand, more and more visual descriptors have been proposed to describe objects and scenes appearing in images and different features describe different aspects of the visual characteristics. Therefore, how to integrate heterogeneous visual features to do the semi-supervised learning is crucial for categorizing large-scale image data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to integrate heterogeneous features by performing multi-modal semi-supervised classification on unlabeled as well as unsegmented images. Considering each type of feature as one modality, taking advantage of the large amoun- t of unlabeled data information, our new adaptive multimodal semi-supervised classification (AMMSS) algorithm learns a commonly shared class indicator matrix and the weights for different modalities (image features) simultaneously.</p><p>6 0.10674047 <a title="416-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Video_SEEDS_for_Temporal_Window_Objectness.html">299 iccv-2013-Online Video SEEDS for Temporal Window Objectness</a></p>

<p>Author: Cheng Li, Kris M. Kitani</p><p>Abstract: Egocentric cameras can be used to benefit such tasks as analyzing fine motor skills, recognizing gestures and learning about hand-object manipulation. To enable such technology, we believe that the hands must detected on thepixellevel to gain important information about the shape of the hands and fingers. We show that the problem of pixel-wise hand detection can be effectively solved, by posing the problem as a model recommendation task. As such, the goal of a recommendation system is to recommend the n-best hand detectors based on the probe set a small amount of labeled data from the test distribution. This requirement of a probe set is a serious limitation in many applications, such as ego-centric hand detection, where the test distribution may be continually changing. To address this limitation, we propose the use of virtual probes which can be automatically extracted from the test distribution. The key idea is – that many features, such as the color distribution or relative performance between two detectors, can be used as a proxy to the probe set. In our experiments we show that the recommendation paradigm is well-equipped to handle complex changes in the appearance of the hands in firstperson vision. In particular, we show how our system is able to generalize to new scenarios by testing our model across multiple users.</p><p>3 0.59472066 <a title="416-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_to_Predict_Gaze_in_Egocentric_Video.html">247 iccv-2013-Learning to Predict Gaze in Egocentric Video</a></p>

<p>Author: Quanfu Fan, Prasad Gabbur, Sharath Pankanti</p><p>Abstract: Effective reduction of false alarms in large-scale video surveillance is rather challenging, especially for applications where abnormal events of interest rarely occur, such as abandoned object detection. We develop an approach to prioritize alerts by ranking them, and demonstrate its great effectiveness in reducing false positives while keeping good detection accuracy. Our approach benefits from a novel representation of abandoned object alerts by relative attributes, namely staticness, foregroundness and abandonment. The relative strengths of these attributes are quantified using a ranking function[19] learnt on suitably designed low-level spatial and temporal features.These attributes of varying strengths are not only powerful in distinguishing abandoned objects from false alarms such as people and light artifacts, but also computationally efficient for large-scale deployment. With these features, we apply a linear ranking algorithm to sort alerts according to their relevance to the end-user. We test the effectiveness of our approach on both public data sets and large ones collected from the real world.</p><p>5 0.57625592 <a title="416-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-HOGgles%3A_Visualizing_Object_Detection_Features.html">189 iccv-2013-HOGgles: Visualizing Object Detection Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Vondrick, Aditya Khosla, Tomasz Malisiewicz, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: We introduce algorithms to visualize feature spaces used by object detectors. The tools in this paper allow a human to put on ‘HOG goggles ’ and perceive the visual world as a HOG based object detector sees it. We found that these visualizations allow us to analyze object detection systems in new ways and gain new insight into the detector’s failures. For example, when we visualize the features for high scoring false alarms, we discovered that, although they are clearly wrong in image space, they do look deceptively similar to true positives in feature space. This result suggests that many of these false alarms are caused by our choice of feature space, and indicates that creating a better learning algorithm or building bigger datasets is unlikely to correct these errors. By visualizing feature spaces, we can gain a more intuitive understanding of our detection systems.</p><p>6 0.57159722 <a title="416-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-channel_Correlation_Filters.html">277 iccv-2013-Multi-channel Correlation Filters</a></p>

<p>Author: Tobias Weyand, Bastian Leibe</p><p>Abstract: Current landmark recognition engines are typically aimed at recognizing building-scale landmarks, but miss interesting details like portals, statues or windows. This is because they use a flat clustering that summarizes all photos of a building facade in one cluster. We propose Hierarchical Iconoid Shift, a novel landmark clustering algorithm capable of discovering such details. Instead of just a collection of clusters, the output of HIS is a set of dendrograms describing the detail hierarchy of a landmark. HIS is based on the novel Hierarchical Medoid Shift clustering algorithm that performs a continuous mode search over the complete scale space. HMS is completely parameter-free, has the same complexity as Medoid Shift and is easy to parallelize. We evaluate HIS on 800k images of 34 landmarks and show that it can extract an often surprising amount of detail and structure that can be applied, e.g., to provide a mobile user with more detailed information on a landmark or even to extend the landmark’s Wikipedia article.</p><p>2 0.78873605 <a title="416-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Paper_Doll_Parsing%3A_Retrieving_Similar_Styles_to_Parse_Clothing_Items.html">306 iccv-2013-Paper Doll Parsing: Retrieving Similar Styles to Parse Clothing Items</a></p>

Our approach combines parsing from: pre-trained global clothing models, local clothing models learned on theflyfrom retrieved examples, and transferredparse masks (paper doll item transfer) from retrieved examples.

<p>Author: Gemma Roig, Xavier Boix, Roderick De_Nijs, Sebastian Ramos, Koljia Kuhnlenz, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Most MAP inference algorithms for CRFs optimize an energy function knowing all the potentials. In this paper, we focus on CRFs where the computational cost of instantiating the potentials is orders of magnitude higher than MAP inference. This is often the case in semantic image segmentation, where most potentials are instantiated by slow classifiers fed with costly features. We introduce Active MAP inference 1) to on-the-fly select a subset of potentials to be instantiated in the energy function, leaving the rest of the parameters of the potentials unknown, and 2) to estimate the MAP labeling from such incomplete energy function. Results for semantic segmentation benchmarks, namely PASCAL VOC 2010 [5] and MSRC-21 [19], show that Active MAP inference achieves similar levels of accuracy but with major efficiency gains.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.73473346 <a title="416-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-The_Interestingness_of_Images.html">416 iccv-2013-The Interestingness of Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Gygli, Helmut Grabner, Hayko Riemenschneider, Fabian Nater, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: We investigate human interest in photos. Based on our own and others ’psychological experiments, we identify various cues for “interestingness ”, namely aesthetics, unusualness and general preferences. For the ranking of retrieved images, interestingness is more appropriate than cues proposed earlier. Interestingness is, for example, correlated with what people believe they will remember. This is opposed to actual memorability, which is uncorrelated to both of them. We introduce a set of features computationally capturing the three main aspects of visual interestingness that we propose and build an interestingness predictor from them. Its performance is shown on three datasets with varying context, reflecting diverse levels of prior knowledge of the viewers.</p><p>5 0.68566871 <a title="416-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Near-Optimal_Cost-Sensitive_Decision_Policy_for_Object_Detection.html">241 iccv-2013-Learning Near-Optimal Cost-Sensitive Decision Policy for Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Tianfu Wu, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Many object detectors, such as AdaBoost, SVM and deformable part-based models (DPM), compute additive scoring functions at a large number of windows scanned over image pyramid, thus computational efficiency is an important consideration beside accuracy performance. In this paper, we present a framework of learning cost-sensitive decision policy which is a sequence of two-sided thresholds to execute early rejection or early acceptance based on the accumulative scores at each step. A decision policy is said to be optimal if it minimizes an empirical global risk function that sums over the loss of false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP), and the cost of computation. While the risk function is very complex due to high-order connections among the two-sided thresholds, we find its upper bound can be optimized by dynamic programming (DP) efficiently and thus say the learned policy is near-optimal. Given the loss of FN and FP and the cost in three numbers, our method can produce a policy on-the-fly for Adaboost, SVM and DPM. In experiments, we show that our decision policy outperforms state-of-the-art cascade methods significantly in terms of speed with similar accuracy performance.</p><p>6 0.6850521 <a title="416-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Modifying_the_Memorability_of_Face_Photographs.html">272 iccv-2013-Modifying the Memorability of Face Photographs</a></p>

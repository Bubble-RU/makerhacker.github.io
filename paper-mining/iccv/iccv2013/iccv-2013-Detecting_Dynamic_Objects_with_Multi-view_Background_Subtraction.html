<p>Author: Kevin Matzen, Noah Snavely</p><p>Abstract: Geometry and geography can play an important role in recognition tasks in computer vision. To aid in studying connections between geometry and recognition, we introduce NYC3DCars, a rich dataset for vehicle detection in urban scenes built from Internet photos drawn from the wild, focused on densely trafficked areas of New York City. Our dataset is augmented with detailed geometric and geographic information, including full camera poses derived from structure from motion, 3D vehicle annotations, and geographic information from open resources, including road segmentations and directions of travel. NYC3DCars can be used to study new questions about using geometric information in detection tasks, and to explore applications of Internet photos in understanding cities. To demonstrate the utility of our data, we evaluate the use of the geographic information in our dataset to enhance a parts-based detection method, and suggest other avenues for future exploration.</p><p>3 0.22496729 <a title="111-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Segmentation_Driven_Object_Detection_with_Fisher_Vectors.html">377 iccv-2013-Segmentation Driven Object Detection with Fisher Vectors</a></p>

Re-weighting the local image features based on these masks is shown to improve object detection significantly. We also exploit contextual features in the form of a full-image FV descriptor, and an inter-category rescoring mechanism.

<p>Author: Jiyan Pan, Takeo Kanade</p><p>Abstract: Objects in a real world image cannot have arbitrary appearance, sizes and locations due to geometric constraints in 3D space. Such a 3D geometric context plays an important role in resolving visual ambiguities and achieving coherent object detection. In this paper, we develop a RANSAC-CRF framework to detect objects that are geometrically coherent in the 3D world. Different from existing methods, we propose a novel generalized RANSAC algorithm to generate global 3D geometry hypothesesfrom local entities such that outlier suppression and noise reduction is achieved simultaneously. In addition, we evaluate those hypotheses using a CRF which considers both the compatibility of individual objects under global 3D geometric context and the compatibility between adjacent objects under local 3D geometric context. Experiment results show that our approach compares favorably with the state of the art.</p><p>5 0.17240855 <a title="111-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Shape_Anchors_for_Data-Driven_Multi-view_Reconstruction.html">387 iccv-2013-Shape Anchors for Data-Driven Multi-view Reconstruction</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Owens, Jianxiong Xiao, Antonio Torralba, William Freeman</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven method for building dense 3D reconstructions using a combination of recognition and multi-view cues. Our approach is based on the idea that there are image patches that are so distinctive that we can accurately estimate their latent 3D shapes solely using recognition. We call these patches shape anchors, and we use them as the basis of a multi-view reconstruction system that transfers dense, complex geometry between scenes. We “anchor” our 3D interpretation from these patches, using them to predict geometry for parts of the scene that are relatively ambiguous. The resulting algorithm produces dense reconstructions from stereo point clouds that are sparse and noisy, and we demonstrate it on a challenging dataset of real-world, indoor scenes.</p><p>6 0.17038064 <a title="111-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-SUN3D%3A_A_Database_of_Big_Spaces_Reconstructed_Using_SfM_and_Object_Labels.html">367 iccv-2013-SUN3D: A Database of Big Spaces Reconstructed Using SfM and Object Labels</a></p>

<p>Author: Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Zhiheng Huang, Alexander C. Berg, Li Fei-Fei</p><p>Abstract: The growth of detection datasets and the multiple directions of object detection research provide both an unprecedented need and a great opportunity for a thorough evaluation of the current state of the field of categorical object detection. In this paper we strive to answer two key questions. First, where are we currently as a field: what have we done right, what still needs to be improved? Second, where should we be going in designing the next generation of object detectors? Inspired by the recent work of Hoiem et al. [10] on the standard PASCAL VOC detection dataset, we perform a large-scale study on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) data. First, we quantitatively demonstrate that this dataset provides many of the same detection challenges as the PASCAL VOC. Due to its scale of 1000 object categories, ILSVRC also provides an excellent testbed for understanding the performance of detectors as a function of several key properties of the object classes. We conduct a series of analyses looking at how different detection methods perform on a number of imagelevel and object-class-levelproperties such as texture, color, deformation, and clutter. We learn important lessons of the current object detection methods and propose a number of insights for designing the next generation object detectors.</p><p>6 0.64744329 <a title="111-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Training_Deformable_Part_Models_with_Decorrelated_Features.html">426 iccv-2013-Training Deformable Part Models with Decorrelated Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Kwang In Kim, James Tompkin, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: One fundamental assumption in object recognition as well as in other computer vision and pattern recognition problems is that the data generation process lies on a manifold and that it respects the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. This assumption is held in several successful algorithms for diffusion and regularization, in particular, in graph-Laplacian-based algorithms. We claim that the performance of existing algorithms can be improved if we additionally account for how the manifold is embedded within the ambient space, i.e., if we consider the extrinsic geometry of the manifold. We present a procedure for characterizing the extrinsic (as well as intrinsic) curvature of a manifold M which is described by a sampled point cloud in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Once estimated, we use this characterization in general diffusion and regularization on M, and form a new regularizer on a point cloud. The resulting re-weighted graph Laplacian demonstrates superior performance over classical graph Laplacian in semisupervised learning and spectral clustering.</p><p>2 0.887205 <a title="111-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Shape_Index_Descriptors_Applied_to_Texture-Based_Galaxy_Analysis.html">388 iccv-2013-Shape Index Descriptors Applied to Texture-Based Galaxy Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Kim Steenstrup Pedersen, Kristoffer Stensbo-Smidt, Andrew Zirm, Christian Igel</p><p>Abstract: A texture descriptor based on the shape index and the accompanying curvedness measure is proposed, and it is evaluated for the automated analysis of astronomical image data. A representative sample of images of low-redshift galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) serves as a testbed. The goal of applying texture descriptors to these data is to extract novel information about galaxies; information which is often lost in more traditional analysis. In this study, we build a regression model for predicting a spectroscopic quantity, the specific star-formation rate (sSFR). As texture features we consider multi-scale gradient orientation histograms as well as multi-scale shape index histograms, which lead to a new descriptor. Our results show that we can successfully predict spectroscopic quantities from the texture in optical multi-band images. We successfully recover the observed bi-modal distribution of galaxies into quiescent and star-forming. The state-ofthe-art for predicting the sSFR is a color-based physical model. We significantly improve its accuracy by augmenting the model with texture information. This study is thefirst step towards enabling the quantification of physical galaxy properties from imaging data alone.</p><p>3 0.88486487 <a title="111-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Elastic_Net_Constraints_for_Shape_Matching.html">140 iccv-2013-Elastic Net Constraints for Shape Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuele Rodolà, Andrea Torsello, Tatsuya Harada, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We consider a parametrized relaxation of the widely adopted quadratic assignment problem (QAP) formulation for minimum distortion correspondence between deformable shapes. In order to control the accuracy/sparsity trade-off we introduce a weighting parameter on the combination of two existing relaxations, namely spectral and game-theoretic. This leads to the introduction of the elastic net penalty function into shape matching problems. In combination with an efficient algorithm to project onto the elastic net ball, we obtain an approach for deformable shape matching with controllable sparsity. Experiments on a standard benchmark confirm the effectiveness of the approach.</p><p>4 0.87362075 <a title="111-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-SUN3D%3A_A_Database_of_Big_Spaces_Reconstructed_Using_SfM_and_Object_Labels.html">367 iccv-2013-SUN3D: A Database of Big Spaces Reconstructed Using SfM and Object Labels</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxiong Xiao, Andrew Owens, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: Existing scene understanding datasets contain only a limited set of views of a place, and they lack representations of complete 3D spaces. In this paper, we introduce SUN3D, a large-scale RGB-D video database with camera pose and object labels, capturing the full 3D extent of many places. The tasks that go into constructing such a dataset are difficult in isolation hand-labeling videos is painstaking, and structure from motion (SfM) is unreliable for large spaces. But if we combine them together, we make the dataset construction task much easier. First, we introduce an intuitive labeling tool that uses a partial reconstruction to propagate labels from one frame to another. Then we use the object labels to fix errors in the reconstruction. For this, we introduce a generalization of bundle adjustment that incorporates object-to-object correspondences. This algorithm works by constraining points for the same object from different frames to lie inside a fixed-size bounding box, parameterized by its rotation and translation. The SUN3D database, the source code for the generalized bundle adjustment, and the web-based 3D annotation tool are all avail– able at http://sun3d.cs.princeton.edu.</p><p>5 0.87114549 <a title="111-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Correntropy_Induced_L2_Graph_for_Robust_Subspace_Clustering.html">94 iccv-2013-Correntropy Induced L2 Graph for Robust Subspace Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jinhui Tang, Min Lin, Liang Lin, Shuicheng Yan, Zhouchen Lin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the robust subspace clustering problem, which aims to cluster the given possibly noisy data points into their underlying subspaces. A large pool of previous subspace clustering methods focus on the graph construction by different regularization of the representation coefficient. We instead focus on the robustness of the model to non-Gaussian noises. We propose a new robust clustering method by using the correntropy induced metric, which is robust for handling the non-Gaussian and impulsive noises. Also we further extend the method for handling the data with outlier rows/features. The multiplicative form of half-quadratic optimization is used to optimize the nonconvex correntropy objective function of the proposed models. Extensive experiments on face datasets well demonstrate that the proposed methods are more robust to corruptions and occlusions.</p><p>6 0.80775839 <a title="111-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Dictionary_Learning_and_Sparse_Coding_on_Grassmann_Manifolds%3A_An_Extrinsic_Solution.html">114 iccv-2013-Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding on Grassmann Manifolds: An Extrinsic Solution</a></p>

<p>Author: Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis, Jakob Verbeek, Cordelia Schmid</p><p>Abstract: We present an object detection system based on the Fisher vector (FV) image representation computed over SIFT and color descriptors. For computational and storage efficiency, we use a recent segmentation-based method to generate class-independent object detection hypotheses, in combination with data compression techniques. Our main contribution is a method to produce tentative object segmentation masks to suppress background clutter in the features. Re-weighting the local image features based on these masks is shown to improve object detection significantly. We also exploit contextual features in the form of a full-image FV descriptor, and an inter-category rescoring mechanism. Our experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2010 datasets show that our detector improves over the current state-of-the-art detection results.</p><p>3 0.2842344 <a title="379-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Segmentation_by_Tracking_Many_Figure-Ground_Segments.html">442 iccv-2013-Video Segmentation by Tracking Many Figure-Ground Segments</a></p>
<p>Author: Fuxin Li, Taeyoung Kim, Ahmad Humayun, David Tsai, James M. Rehg</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised video segmentation approach by simultaneously tracking multiple holistic figureground segments. Segment tracks are initialized from a pool of segment proposals generated from a figure-ground segmentation algorithm. Then, online non-local appearance models are trained incrementally for each track using a multi-output regularized least squares formulation. By using the same set of training examples for all segment tracks, a computational trick allows us to track hundreds of segment tracks efficiently, as well as perform optimal online updates in closed-form. Besides, a new composite statistical inference approach is proposed for refining the obtained segment tracks, which breaks down the initial segment proposals and recombines for better ones by utilizing highorder statistic estimates from the appearance model and enforcing temporal consistency. For evaluating the algorithm, a dataset, SegTrack v2, is collected with about 1,000 frames with pixel-level annotations. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in the dataset, show- ing its efficiency and robustness to challenges in different video sequences.</p><p>4 0.26934353 <a title="379-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Action_Recognition_and_Localization_by_Hierarchical_Space-Time_Segments.html">37 iccv-2013-Action Recognition and Localization by Hierarchical Space-Time Segments</a></p>
<p>Author: Shugao Ma, Jianming Zhang, Nazli Ikizler-Cinbis, Stan Sclaroff</p><p>Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Space-Time Segments as a new representation for action recognition and localization. This representation has a two-level hierarchy. The first level comprises the root space-time segments that may contain a human body. The second level comprises multi-grained space-time segments that contain parts of the root. We present an unsupervised method to generate this representation from video, which extracts both static and non-static relevant space-time segments, and also preserves their hierarchical and temporal relationships. Using simple linear SVM on the resultant bag of hierarchical space-time segments representation, we attain better than, or comparable to, state-of-the-art action recognition performance on two challenging benchmark datasets and at the same time produce good action localization results.</p><p>5 0.25535879 <a title="379-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Predicting_Sufficient_Annotation_Strength_for_Interactive_Foreground_Segmentation.html">326 iccv-2013-Predicting Sufficient Annotation Strength for Interactive Foreground Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Suyog Dutt Jain, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: The mode of manual annotation used in an interactive segmentation algorithm affects both its accuracy and easeof-use. For example, bounding boxes are fast to supply, yet may be too coarse to get good results on difficult images; freehand outlines are slower to supply and more specific, yet they may be overkill for simple images. Whereas existing methods assume a fixed form of input no matter the image, we propose to predict the tradeoff between accuracy and effort. Our approach learns whether a graph cuts segmentation will succeed if initialized with a given annotation mode, based on the image ’s visual separability and foreground uncertainty. Using these predictions, we optimize the mode of input requested on new images a user wants segmented. Whether given a single image that should be segmented as quickly as possible, or a batch of images that must be segmented within a specified time budget, we show how to select the easiest modality that will be sufficiently strong to yield high quality segmentations. Extensive results with real users and three datasets demonstrate the impact.</p><p>6 0.22107093 <a title="379-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-GrabCut_in_One_Cut.html">186 iccv-2013-GrabCut in One Cut</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuning Chai, Victor Lempitsky, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new method for the task of fine-grained visual categorization. The method builds a model of the baselevel category that can be fitted to images, producing highquality foreground segmentation and mid-level part localizations. The model can be learnt from the typical datasets available for fine-grained categorization, where the only annotation provided is a loose bounding box around the instance (e.g. bird) in each image. Both segmentation and part localizations are then used to encode the image content into a highly-discriminative visual signature. The model is symbiotic in that part discovery/localization is helped by segmentation and, conversely, the segmentation is helped by the detection (e.g. part layout). Our model builds on top of the part-based object category detector of Felzenszwalb et al., and also on the powerful GrabCut segmentation algorithm of Rother et al., and adds a simple spatial saliency coupling between them. In our evaluation, the model improves the categorization accuracy over the state-of-the-art. It also improves over what can be achieved with an analogous system that runs segmentation and part-localization independently.</p><p>4 0.83332944 <a title="379-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-GrabCut_in_One_Cut.html">186 iccv-2013-GrabCut in One Cut</a></p>
<p>Author: Meng Tang, Lena Gorelick, Olga Veksler, Yuri Boykov</p><p>Abstract: Among image segmentation algorithms there are two major groups: (a) methods assuming known appearance models and (b) methods estimating appearance models jointly with segmentation. Typically, the first group optimizes appearance log-likelihoods in combination with some spacial regularization. This problem is relatively simple and many methods guarantee globally optimal results. The second group treats model parameters as additional variables transforming simple segmentation energies into highorder NP-hard functionals (Zhu-Yuille, Chan-Vese, GrabCut, etc). It is known that such methods indirectly minimize the appearance overlap between the segments. We propose a new energy term explicitly measuring L1 distance between the object and background appearance models that can be globally maximized in one graph cut. We show that in many applications our simple term makes NP-hard segmentation functionals unnecessary. Our one cut algorithm effectively replaces approximate iterative optimization techniques based on block coordinate descent.</p><p>5 0.82410026 <a title="379-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Bounded_Labeling_Function_for_Global_Segmentation_of_Multi-part_Objects_with_Geometric_Constraints.html">63 iccv-2013-Bounded Labeling Function for Global Segmentation of Multi-part Objects with Geometric Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Tomer Michaeli, Michal Irani</p><p>Abstract: Super resolution (SR) algorithms typically assume that the blur kernel is known (either the Point Spread Function ‘PSF’ of the camera, or some default low-pass filter, e.g. a Gaussian). However, the performance of SR methods significantly deteriorates when the assumed blur kernel deviates from the true one. We propose a general framework for “blind” super resolution. In particular, we show that: (i) Unlike the common belief, the PSF of the camera is the wrong blur kernel to use in SR algorithms. (ii) We show how the correct SR blur kernel can be recovered directly from the low-resolution image. This is done by exploiting the inherent recurrence property of small natural image patches (either internally within the same image, or externally in a collection of other natural images). In particular, we show that recurrence of small patches across scales of the low-res image (which forms the basis for single-image SR), can also be used for estimating the optimal blur kernel. This leads to significant improvement in SR results.</p><p>2 0.8343848 <a title="379-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Cosegmentation_and_Cosketch_by_Unsupervised_Learning.html">95 iccv-2013-Cosegmentation and Cosketch by Unsupervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jifeng Dai, Ying Nian Wu, Jie Zhou, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Cosegmentation refers to theproblem ofsegmenting multiple images simultaneously by exploiting the similarities between the foreground and background regions in these images. The key issue in cosegmentation is to align common objects between these images. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised learning framework for cosegmentation, by coupling cosegmentation with what we call “cosketch ”. The goal of cosketch is to automatically discover a codebook of deformable shape templates shared by the input images. These shape templates capture distinct image patterns and each template is matched to similar image patches in different images. Thus the cosketch of the images helps to align foreground objects, thereby providing crucial information for cosegmentation. We present a statistical model whose energy function couples cosketch and cosegmentation. We then present an unsupervised learning algorithm that performs cosketch and cosegmentation by energy minimization. Experiments show that our method outperforms state of the art methods for cosegmentation on the challenging MSRC and iCoseg datasets. We also illustrate our method on a new dataset called Coseg-Rep where cosegmentation can be performed within a single image with repetitive patterns.</p><p>3 0.82694966 <a title="379-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Piecewise_Rigid_Scene_Flow.html">317 iccv-2013-Piecewise Rigid Scene Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph Vogel, Konrad Schindler, Stefan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Estimating dense 3D scene flow from stereo sequences remains a challenging task, despite much progress in both classical disparity and 2D optical flow estimation. To overcome the limitations of existing techniques, we introduce a novel model that represents the dynamic 3D scene by a collection of planar, rigidly moving, local segments. Scene flow estimation then amounts to jointly estimating the pixelto-segment assignment, and the 3D position, normal vector, and rigid motion parameters of a plane for each segment. The proposed energy combines an occlusion-sensitive data term with appropriate shape, motion, and segmentation regularizers. Optimization proceeds in two stages: Starting from an initial superpixelization, we estimate the shape and motion parameters of all segments by assigning a proposal from a set of moving planes. Then the pixel-to-segment assignment is updated, while holding the shape and motion parameters of the moving planes fixed. We demonstrate the benefits of our model on different real-world image sets, including the challenging KITTI benchmark. We achieve leading performance levels, exceeding competing 3D scene flow methods, and even yielding better 2D motion estimates than all tested dedicated optical flow techniques.</p><p>4 0.81510925 <a title="379-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Depth_from_Combining_Defocus_and_Correspondence_Using_Light-Field_Cameras.html">108 iccv-2013-Depth from Combining Defocus and Correspondence Using Light-Field Cameras</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael W. Tao, Sunil Hadap, Jitendra Malik, Ravi Ramamoorthi</p><p>Abstract: Light-field cameras have recently become available to the consumer market. An array of micro-lenses captures enough information that one can refocus images after acquisition, as well as shift one ’s viewpoint within the subapertures of the main lens, effectively obtaining multiple views. Thus, depth cues from both defocus and correspondence are available simultaneously in a single capture. Previously, defocus could be achieved only through multiple image exposures focused at different depths, while correspondence cues needed multiple exposures at different viewpoints or multiple cameras; moreover, both cues could not easily be obtained together. In this paper, we present a novel simple and principled algorithm that computes dense depth estimation by combining both defocus and correspondence depth cues. We analyze the x-u 2D epipolar image (EPI), where by convention we assume the spatial x coordinate is horizontal and the angular u coordinate is vertical (our final algorithm uses the full 4D EPI). We show that defocus depth cues are obtained by computing the horizontal (spatial) variance after vertical (angular) integration, and correspondence depth cues by computing the vertical (angular) variance. We then show how to combine the two cues into a high quality depth map, suitable for computer vision applications such as matting, full control of depth-of-field, and surface reconstruction.</p><p>5 0.81352705 <a title="379-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Graph_Matching%3A_Oriented_to_Category_Modeling_from_Cluttered_Scenes.html">237 iccv-2013-Learning Graph Matching: Oriented to Category Modeling from Cluttered Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Quanshi Zhang, Xuan Song, Xiaowei Shao, Huijing Zhao, Ryosuke Shibasaki</p><p>Abstract: Although graph matching is a fundamental problem in pattern recognition, and has drawn broad interest from many fields, the problem of learning graph matching has not received much attention. In this paper, we redefine the learning ofgraph matching as a model learningproblem. In addition to conventional training of matching parameters, our approach modifies the graph structure and attributes to generate a graphical model. In this way, the model learning is oriented toward both matching and recognition performance, and can proceed in an unsupervised1 fashion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional methods for learning graph matching.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.8113957 <a title="379-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic_Segmentation_without_Annotating_Segments.html">379 iccv-2013-Semantic Segmentation without Annotating Segments</a></p>

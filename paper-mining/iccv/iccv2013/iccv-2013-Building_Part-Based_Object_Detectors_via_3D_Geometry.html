<p>Author: Ning Zhang, Ryan Farrell, Forrest Iandola, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing objects in fine-grained domains can be extremely challenging due to the subtle differences between subcategories. Discriminative markings are often highly localized, leading traditional object recognition approaches to struggle with the large pose variation often present in these domains. Pose-normalization seeks to align training exemplars, either piecewise by part or globally for the whole object, effectively factoring out differences in pose and in viewing angle. Prior approaches relied on computationally-expensive filter ensembles for part localization and required extensive supervision. This paper proposes two pose-normalized descriptors based on computationally-efficient deformable part models. The first leverages the semantics inherent in strongly-supervised DPM parts. The second exploits weak semantic annotations to learn cross-component correspondences, computing pose-normalized descriptors from the latent parts of a weakly-supervised DPM. These representations enable pooling across pose and viewpoint, in turn facilitating tasks such as fine-grained recognition and attribute prediction. Experiments conducted on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset and Berkeley Human Attribute dataset demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-art algorithms.</p><p>3 0.13262208 <a title="66-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Support_Surface_Prediction_in_Indoor_Scenes.html">410 iccv-2013-Support Surface Prediction in Indoor Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruiqi Guo, Derek Hoiem</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach to predict the extent and height of supporting surfaces such as tables, chairs, and cabinet tops from a single RGBD image. We define support surfaces to be horizontal, planar surfaces that can physically support objects and humans. Given a RGBD image, our goal is to localize the height and full extent of such surfaces in 3D space. To achieve this, we created a labeling tool and annotated 1449 images with rich, complete 3D scene models in NYU dataset. We extract ground truth from the annotated dataset and developed a pipeline for predicting floor space, walls, the height and full extent of support surfaces. Finally we match the predicted extent with annotated scenes in training scenes and transfer the the support surface configuration from training scenes. We evaluate the proposed approach in our dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in understanding scenes in 3D space.</p><p>4 0.12751669 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-3DNN%3A_Viewpoint_Invariant_3D_Geometry_Matching_for_Scene_Understanding.html">1 iccv-2013-3DNN: Viewpoint Invariant 3D Geometry Matching for Scene Understanding</a></p>
<p>Author: Scott Satkin, Martial Hebert</p><p>Abstract: We present a new algorithm 3DNN (3D NearestNeighbor), which is capable of matching an image with 3D data, independently of the viewpoint from which the image was captured. By leveraging rich annotations associated with each image, our algorithm can automatically produce precise and detailed 3D models of a scene from a single image. Moreover, we can transfer information across images to accurately label and segment objects in a scene. The true benefit of 3DNN compared to a traditional 2D nearest-neighbor approach is that by generalizing across viewpoints, we free ourselves from the need to have training examples captured from all possible viewpoints. Thus, we are able to achieve comparable results using orders of magnitude less data, and recognize objects from never-beforeseen viewpoints. In this work, we describe the 3DNN algorithm and rigorously evaluate its performance for the tasks of geometry estimation and object detection/segmentation. By decoupling the viewpoint and the geometry of an image, we develop a scene matching approach which is truly 100% viewpoint invariant, yielding state-of-the-art performance on challenging data.</p><p>5 0.11797749 <a title="66-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Coherent_Object_Detection_with_3D_Geometric_Context_from_a_Single_Image.html">79 iccv-2013-Coherent Object Detection with 3D Geometric Context from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiyan Pan, Takeo Kanade</p><p>Abstract: Objects in a real world image cannot have arbitrary appearance, sizes and locations due to geometric constraints in 3D space. Such a 3D geometric context plays an important role in resolving visual ambiguities and achieving coherent object detection. In this paper, we develop a RANSAC-CRF framework to detect objects that are geometrically coherent in the 3D world. Different from existing methods, we propose a novel generalized RANSAC algorithm to generate global 3D geometry hypothesesfrom local entities such that outlier suppression and noise reduction is achieved simultaneously. In addition, we evaluate those hypotheses using a CRF which considers both the compatibility of individual objects under global 3D geometric context and the compatibility between adjacent objects under local 3D geometric context. Experiment results show that our approach compares favorably with the state of the art.</p><p>6 0.10706019 <a title="66-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Holistic_Scene_Understanding_for_3D_Object_Detection_with_RGBD_Cameras.html">201 iccv-2013-Holistic Scene Understanding for 3D Object Detection with RGBD Cameras</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaoyu Wang, Ming Yang, Shenghuo Zhu, Yuanqing Lin</p><p>Abstract: Generic object detection is confronted by dealing with different degrees of variations in distinct object classes with tractable computations, which demands for descriptive and flexible object representations that are also efficient to evaluate for many locations. In view of this, we propose to model an object class by a cascaded boosting classifier which integrates various types of features from competing local regions, named as regionlets. A regionlet is a base feature extraction region defined proportionally to a detection window at an arbitrary resolution (i.e. size and aspect ratio). These regionlets are organized in small groups with stable relative positions to delineate fine-grained spatial layouts inside objects. Their features are aggregated to a one-dimensional feature within one group so as to tolerate deformations. Then we evaluate the object bounding box proposal in selective search from segmentation cues, limiting the evaluation locations to thousands. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on popular multi-class detection benchmark datasets with a single method, without any contexts. It achieves the detec- tion mean average precision of 41. 7% on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and 39. 7% on the VOC 2010 for 20 object categories. It achieves 14. 7% mean average precision on the ImageNet dataset for 200 object categories, outperforming the latest deformable part-based model (DPM) by 4. 7%.</p><p>4 0.6904605 <a title="66-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Coherent_Object_Detection_with_3D_Geometric_Context_from_a_Single_Image.html">79 iccv-2013-Coherent Object Detection with 3D Geometric Context from a Single Image</a></p>

<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Xianfeng Gu, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dense non-rigid 3D surface registration, which brings together Riemannian geometry and graphical models. To this end, we first introduce a generic deformation model, called Canonical Distortion Coefficients (CDCs), by characterizing the deformation of every point on a surface using the distortions along its two principle directions. This model subsumes the deformation groups commonly used in surface registration such as isometry and conformality, and is able to handle more complex deformations. We also derive its discrete counterpart which can be computed very efficiently in a closed form. Based on these, we introduce a higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) model which seamlessly integrates our deformation model and a geometry/texture similarity metric. Then we jointly establish the optimal correspondences for all the points via maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Moreover, we develop a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently perform the inference for the proposed higher-order MRF model. The resulting registration algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both dense non-rigid 3D surface registration and tracking.</p><p>6 0.6590746 <a title="66-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Data-Driven_3D_Primitives_for_Single_Image_Understanding.html">102 iccv-2013-Data-Driven 3D Primitives for Single Image Understanding</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuqian Zhang, Cun Mu, Han-Wen Kuo, John Wright</p><p>Abstract: Illumination variation remains a central challenge in object detection and recognition. Existing analyses of illumination variation typically pertain to convex, Lambertian objects, and guarantee quality of approximation in an average case sense. We show that it is possible to build models for the set of images across illumination variation with worstcase performance guarantees, for nonconvex Lambertian objects. Namely, a natural verification test based on the distance to the model guarantees to accept any image which can be sufficiently well-approximated by an image of the object under some admissible lighting condition, and guarantees to reject any image that does not have a sufficiently good approximation. These models are generated by sampling illumination directions with sufficient density, which follows from a new perturbation bound for directional illuminated images in the Lambertian model. As the number of such images required for guaranteed verification may be large, we introduce a new formulation for cone preserving dimensionality reduction, which leverages tools from sparse and low-rank decomposition to reduce the complexity, while controlling the approximation error with respect to the original model. 1</p><p>2 0.84156948 <a title="66-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-No_Matter_Where_You_Are%3A_Flexible_Graph-Guided_Multi-task_Learning_for_Multi-view_Head_Pose_Classification_under_Target_Motion.html">291 iccv-2013-No Matter Where You Are: Flexible Graph-Guided Multi-task Learning for Multi-view Head Pose Classification under Target Motion</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Yan, Elisa Ricci, Ramanathan Subramanian, Oswald Lanz, Nicu Sebe</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel Multi-Task Learning framework (FEGA-MTL) for classifying the head pose of a person who moves freely in an environment monitored by multiple, large field-of-view surveillance cameras. As the target (person) moves, distortions in facial appearance owing to camera perspective and scale severely impede performance of traditional head pose classification methods. FEGA-MTL operates on a dense uniform spatial grid and learns appearance relationships across partitions as well as partition-specific appearance variations for a given head pose to build region-specific classifiers. Guided by two graphs which a-priori model appearance similarity among (i) grid partitions based on camera geometry and (ii) head pose classes, the learner efficiently clusters appearancewise related grid partitions to derive the optimal partitioning. For pose classification, upon determining the target’s position using a person tracker, the appropriate regionspecific classifier is invoked. Experiments confirm that FEGA-MTL achieves state-of-the-art classification with few training data.</p><p>3 0.83439261 <a title="66-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Pose-Configurable_Generic_Tracking_of_Elongated_Objects.html">320 iccv-2013-Pose-Configurable Generic Tracking of Elongated Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Wesierski, Patrick Horain</p><p>Abstract: Elongated objects have various shapes and can shift, rotate, change scale, and be rigid or deform by flexing, articulating, and vibrating, with examples as varied as a glass bottle, a robotic arm, a surgical suture, a finger pair, a tram, and a guitar string. This generally makes tracking of poses of elongated objects very challenging. We describe a unified, configurable framework for tracking the pose of elongated objects, which move in the image plane and extend over the image region. Our method strives for simplicity, versatility, and efficiency. The object is decomposed into a chained assembly of segments of multiple parts that are arranged under a hierarchy of tailored spatio-temporal constraints. In this hierarchy, segments can rescale independently while their elasticity is controlled with global orientations and local distances. While the trend in tracking is to design complex, structure-free algorithms that update object appearance on- line, we show that our tracker, with the novel but remarkably simple, structured organization of parts with constant appearance, reaches or improves state-of-the-art performance. Most importantly, our model can be easily configured to track exact pose of arbitrary, elongated objects in the image plane. The tracker can run up to 100 fps on a desktop PC, yet the computation time scales linearly with the number of object parts. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to generic tracking of elongated objects.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.81356525 <a title="66-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Building_Part-Based_Object_Detectors_via_3D_Geometry.html">66 iccv-2013-Building Part-Based Object Detectors via 3D Geometry</a></p>
<p>Author: Abhinav Shrivastava, Abhinav Gupta</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel part-based representation for modeling object categories. Our representation combines the effectiveness of deformable part-based models with the richness of geometric representation by defining parts based on consistent underlying 3D geometry. Our key hypothesis is that while the appearance and the arrangement of parts might vary across the instances of object categories, the constituent parts will still have consistent underlying 3D geometry. We propose to learn this geometrydriven deformable part-based model (gDPM) from a set of labeled RGBD images. We also demonstrate how the geometric representation of gDPM can help us leverage depth data during training and constrain the latent model learning problem. But most importantly, a joint geometric and appearance based representation not only allows us to achieve state-of-the-art results on object detection but also allows us to tackle the grand challenge of understanding 3D objects from 2D images.</p><p>5 0.80431956 <a title="66-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Fully_Hierarchical_Approach_for_Finding_Correspondences_in_Non-rigid_Shapes.html">11 iccv-2013-A Fully Hierarchical Approach for Finding Correspondences in Non-rigid Shapes</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivan Sipiran, Benjamin Bustos</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical method for finding correspondences in non-rigid shapes. We propose a new representation for 3D meshes: the decomposition tree. This structure characterizes the recursive decomposition process of a mesh into regions of interest and keypoints. The internal nodes contain regions of interest (which may be recursively decomposed) and the leaf nodes contain the keypoints to be matched. We also propose a hierarchical matching algorithm that performs in a level-wise manner. The matching process is guided by the similarity between regions in high levels of the tree, until reaching the keypoints stored in the leaves. This allows us to reduce the search space of correspondences, making also the matching process efficient. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using the SHREC’2010 robust correspondence benchmark. In addition, we show that our results outperform the state of the art.</p><p>6 0.80250603 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Predicting_Sufficient_Annotation_Strength_for_Interactive_Foreground_Segmentation.html">326 iccv-2013-Predicting Sufficient Annotation Strength for Interactive Foreground Segmentation</a></p>

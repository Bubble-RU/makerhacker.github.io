<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Xianfeng Gu, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dense non-rigid 3D surface registration, which brings together Riemannian geometry and graphical models. To this end, we first introduce a generic deformation model, called Canonical Distortion Coefficients (CDCs), by characterizing the deformation of every point on a surface using the distortions along its two principle directions. This model subsumes the deformation groups commonly used in surface registration such as isometry and conformality, and is able to handle more complex deformations. We also derive its discrete counterpart which can be computed very efficiently in a closed form. Based on these, we introduce a higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) model which seamlessly integrates our deformation model and a geometry/texture similarity metric. Then we jointly establish the optimal correspondences for all the points via maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Moreover, we develop a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently perform the inference for the proposed higher-order MRF model. The resulting registration algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both dense non-rigid 3D surface registration and tracking.</p><p>3 0.14577502 <a title="183-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Hierarchical_Data-Driven_Descent_for_Efficient_Optimal_Deformation_Estimation.html">196 iccv-2013-Hierarchical Data-Driven Descent for Efficient Optimal Deformation Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuandong Tian, Srinivasa G. Narasimhan</p><p>Abstract: Real-world surfaces such as clothing, water and human body deform in complex ways. The image distortions observed are high-dimensional and non-linear, making it hard to estimate these deformations accurately. The recent datadriven descent approach [17] applies Nearest Neighbor estimators iteratively on a particular distribution of training samples to obtain a globally optimal and dense deformation field between a template and a distorted image. In this work, we develop a hierarchical structure for the Nearest Neighbor estimators, each of which can have only a local image support. We demonstrate in both theory and practice that this algorithm has several advantages over the nonhierarchical version: it guarantees global optimality with significantly fewer training samples, is several orders faster, provides a metric to decide whether a given image is “hard” (or “easy ”) requiring more (or less) samples, and can handle more complex scenes that include both global motion and local deformation. The proposed algorithm successfully tracks a broad range of non-rigid scenes including water, clothing, and medical images, and compares favorably against several other deformation estimation and tracking approaches that do not provide optimality guarantees.</p><p>4 0.13988942 <a title="183-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Normal_Field_Integration_for_3D_Reconstruction_of_Mirroring_Objects.html">281 iccv-2013-Multi-view Normal Field Integration for 3D Reconstruction of Mirroring Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Weinmann, Aljosa Osep, Roland Ruiters, Reinhard Klein</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel, robust multi-view normal field integration technique for reconstructing the full 3D shape of mirroring objects. We employ a turntablebased setup with several cameras and displays. These are used to display illumination patterns which are reflected by the object surface. The pattern information observed in the cameras enables the calculation of individual volumetric normal fields for each combination of camera, display and turntable angle. As the pattern information might be blurred depending on the surface curvature or due to nonperfect mirroring surface characteristics, we locally adapt the decoding to the finest still resolvable pattern resolution. In complex real-world scenarios, the normal fields contain regions without observations due to occlusions and outliers due to interreflections and noise. Therefore, a robust reconstruction using only normal information is challenging. Via a non-parametric clustering of normal hypotheses derived for each point in the scene, we obtain both the most likely local surface normal and a local surface consistency estimate. This information is utilized in an iterative mincut based variational approach to reconstruct the surface geometry.</p><p>5 0.13343257 <a title="183-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Support_Surface_Prediction_in_Indoor_Scenes.html">410 iccv-2013-Support Surface Prediction in Indoor Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruiqi Guo, Derek Hoiem</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach to predict the extent and height of supporting surfaces such as tables, chairs, and cabinet tops from a single RGBD image. We define support surfaces to be horizontal, planar surfaces that can physically support objects and humans. Given a RGBD image, our goal is to localize the height and full extent of such surfaces in 3D space. To achieve this, we created a labeling tool and annotated 1449 images with rich, complete 3D scene models in NYU dataset. We extract ground truth from the annotated dataset and developed a pipeline for predicting floor space, walls, the height and full extent of support surfaces. Finally we match the predicted extent with annotated scenes in training scenes and transfer the the support surface configuration from training scenes. We evaluate the proposed approach in our dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in understanding scenes in 3D space.</p><p>6 0.12577769 <a title="183-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Real-World_Normal_Map_Capture_for_Nearly_Flat_Reflective_Surfaces.html">343 iccv-2013-Real-World Normal Map Capture for Nearly Flat Reflective Surfaces</a></p>

<p>Author: Che-Han Chang, Min-Chun Hu, Wen-Huang Cheng, Yung-Yu Chuang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new projection model for mapping a hemisphere to a plane. Such a model can be useful for viewing wide-angle images. Our model consists of two steps. In the first step, the hemisphere is projected onto a swung surface constructed by a circular profile and a rounded rectangular trajectory. The second step maps the projected image on the swung surface onto the image plane through the perspective projection. We also propose a method for automatically determining proper parameters for the projection model based on image content. The proposed model has several advantages. It is simple, efficient and easy to control. Most importantly, it makes a better compromise between distortion minimization and line preserving than popular projection models, such as stereographic and Pannini projections. Experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p><p>4 0.65193129 <a title="183-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Parallel_Transport_of_Deformations_in_Shape_Space_of_Elastic_Surfaces.html">307 iccv-2013-Parallel Transport of Deformations in Shape Space of Elastic Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Qian Xie, Sebastian Kurtek, Huiling Le, Anuj Srivastava</p><p>Abstract: Statistical shape analysis develops methods for comparisons, deformations, summarizations, and modeling of shapes in given data sets. These tasks require afundamental tool called parallel transport of tangent vectors along arbitrary paths. This tool is essential for: (1) computation of geodesic paths using either shooting or path-straightening method, (2) transferring deformations across objects, and (3) modeling of statistical variability in shapes. Using the square-root normal field (SRNF) representation of parameterized surfaces, we present a method for transporting deformations along paths in the shape space. This is difficult despite the underlying space being a vector space because the chosen (elastic) Riemannian metric is non-standard. Using a finite-basis for representing SRNFs of shapes, we derive expressions for Christoffel symbols that enable parallel transports. We demonstrate this framework using examples from shape analysis of parameterized spherical sur- faces, in the three contexts mentioned above.</p><p>5 0.59986752 <a title="183-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Point-Based_3D_Reconstruction_of_Thin_Objects.html">319 iccv-2013-Point-Based 3D Reconstruction of Thin Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Ummenhofer, Thomas Brox</p><p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction deals with the problem of finding the shape of an object from a set of images. Thin objects that have virtually no volumepose a special challengefor reconstruction with respect to shape representation and fusion of depth information. In this paper we present a dense pointbased reconstruction method that can deal with this special class of objects. We seek to jointly optimize a set of depth maps by treating each pixel as a point in space. Points are pulled towards a common surface by pairwise forces in an iterative scheme. The method also handles the problem of opposed surfaces by means of penalty forces. Efficient optimization is achieved by grouping points to superpixels and a spatial hashing approach for fast neighborhood queries. We show that the approach is on a par with state-of-the-art methods for standard multi view stereo settings and gives superior results for thin objects.</p><p>6 0.58604723 <a title="183-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Hierarchical_Data-Driven_Descent_for_Efficient_Optimal_Deformation_Estimation.html">196 iccv-2013-Hierarchical Data-Driven Descent for Efficient Optimal Deformation Estimation</a></p>

The experimental results are consistent with the theoreticalpredictions and also demonstrate the performance improvements in feature tracking.</p><p>2 0.70989394 <a title="183-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Rank_Minimization_across_Appearance_and_Shape_for_AAM_Ensemble_Fitting.html">339 iccv-2013-Rank Minimization across Appearance and Shape for AAM Ensemble Fitting</a></p>
<p>Author: Xin Cheng, Sridha Sridharan, Jason Saragih, Simon Lucey</p><p>Abstract: Active Appearance Models (AAMs) employ a paradigm of inverting a synthesis model of how an object can vary in terms of shape and appearance. As a result, the ability of AAMs to register an unseen object image is intrinsically linked to two factors. First, how well the synthesis model can reconstruct the object image. Second, the degrees of freedom in the model. Fewer degrees of freedom yield a higher likelihood of good fitting performance. In this paper we look at how these seemingly contrasting factors can complement one another for the problem of AAM fitting of an ensemble of images stemming from a constrained set (e.g. an ensemble of face images of the same person).</p><p>3 0.66019374 <a title="183-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Forests_of_Local_Experts_for_Pedestrian_Detection.html">336 iccv-2013-Random Forests of Local Experts for Pedestrian Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Javier Marín, David Vázquez, Antonio M. López, Jaume Amores, Bastian Leibe</p><p>Abstract: Pedestrian detection is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, and has received a lot of attention in the last years. Recently, some authors have shown the advantages of using combinations of part/patch-based detectors in order to cope with the large variability of poses and the existence of partial occlusions. In this paper, we propose a pedestrian detection method that efficiently combines multiple local experts by means of a Random Forest ensemble. The proposed method works with rich block-based representations such as HOG and LBP, in such a way that the same features are reused by the multiple local experts, so that no extra computational cost is needed with respect to a holistic method. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to integrate the proposed approach with a cascaded architecture in order to achieve not only high accuracy but also an acceptable efficiency. In particular, the resulting detector operates at five frames per second using a laptop machine. We tested the proposed method with well-known challenging datasets such as Caltech, ETH, Daimler, and INRIA. The method proposed in this work consistently ranks among the top performers in all the datasets, being either the best method or having a small difference with the best one.</p><p>4 0.64557528 <a title="183-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Monocular_Image_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_under_Self-Occlusion.html">273 iccv-2013-Monocular Image 3D Human Pose Estimation under Self-Occlusion</a></p>
<p>Author: Ibrahim Radwan, Abhinav Dhall, Roland Goecke</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, an automatic approach for 3D pose reconstruction from a single image is proposed. The presence of human body articulation, hallucinated parts and cluttered background leads to ambiguity during the pose inference, which makes the problem non-trivial. Researchers have explored various methods based on motion and shading in order to reduce the ambiguity and reconstruct the 3D pose. The key idea of our algorithm is to impose both kinematic and orientation constraints. The former is imposed by projecting a 3D model onto the input image and pruning the parts, which are incompatible with the anthropomorphism. The latter is applied by creating synthetic views via regressing the input view to multiple oriented views. After applying the constraints, the 3D model is projected onto the initial and synthetic views, which further reduces the ambiguity. Finally, we borrow the direction of the unambiguous parts from the synthetic views to the initial one, which results in the 3D pose. Quantitative experiments are performed on the HumanEva-I dataset and qualitatively on unconstrained images from the Image Parse dataset. The results show the robustness of the proposed approach to accurately reconstruct the 3D pose form a single image.</p><p>5 0.63846624 <a title="183-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Event_Detection_in_Complex_Scenes_Using_Interval_Temporal_Constraints.html">146 iccv-2013-Event Detection in Complex Scenes Using Interval Temporal Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yifan Zhang, Qiang Ji, Hanqing Lu</p><p>Abstract: In complex scenes with multiple atomic events happening sequentially or in parallel, detecting each individual event separately may not always obtain robust and reliable result. It is essential to detect them in a holistic way which incorporates the causality and temporal dependency among them to compensate the limitation of current computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose an interval temporal constrained dynamic Bayesian network to extendAllen ’s interval algebra network (IAN) [2]from a deterministic static model to a probabilistic dynamic system, which can not only capture the complex interval temporal relationships, but also model the evolution dynamics and handle the uncertainty from the noisy visual observation. In the model, the topology of the IAN on each time slice and the interlinks between the time slices are discovered by an advanced structure learning method. The duration of the event and the unsynchronized time lags between two correlated event intervals are captured by a duration model, so that we can better determine the temporal boundary of the event. Empirical results on two real world datasets show the power of the proposed interval temporal constrained model.</p><p>6 0.63514137 <a title="183-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Shape_Index_Descriptors_Applied_to_Texture-Based_Galaxy_Analysis.html">388 iccv-2013-Shape Index Descriptors Applied to Texture-Based Galaxy Analysis</a></p>

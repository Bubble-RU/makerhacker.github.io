</p><p>6 Furthermore, we used the distortion estimates for reducing search range in feature matching of surface registration applications. [sent-11, score-0.65]
</p><p>7 3D surface registration is a fundamental tool, which aims at finding a mapping (one-to-one correspondence) between two 3D surfaces. [sent-16, score-0.467]
</p><p>8 3D surface tracking requires generating the mappings over a series of surface frames in 3D spatial-temporal data (3D geometry video or 4D data). [sent-17, score-0.585]
</p><p>9 In the last decade, many 3D surface registration methods have been developed. [sent-24, score-0.366]
</p><p>10 The most well-known iterative closest point (ICP) method [2] works well for rigid motions but cannot handle the nonrigid deformation and inconsistent boundary problems. [sent-25, score-0.303]
</p><p>11 Surface conformal mapping based methods have been developed for surface matching [17, 6, 12], registration [3, 25, 26], and tracking [27]. [sent-27, score-1.085]
</p><p>12 The key idea is to map surfaces to 2D canonical domains and then solve the surface registration problem as an image registration problem. [sent-28, score-0.658]
</p><p>13 The conformal mapping based methods can handle nonrigid deformations and generate diffeomorphisms between surfaces. [sent-29, score-0.757]
</p><p>14 Surface conformal mapping can be generalized to surface quasiconformal mapping, which has great potential to handle large-scale nonrigid (including non-isometric) deformations in surface registration application [24, 13, 14]. [sent-30, score-1.627]
</p><p>15 The fundamental questions to be addressed in this work are as follows: How to quantify the effects of boundary variation and nonisometric deformation to the conformal mapping? [sent-33, score-0.891]
</p><p>16 How sensitive is the conformal mapping based registration method to boundary variation and non-isometric deformation? [sent-34, score-1.024]
</p><p>17 Therefore, when we map two adjacent frames onto the unit disk by conformal mappings, the deviation of the two images of the same point on the face surface is expected to be small. [sent-40, score-0.978]
</p><p>18 It is highly desirable to quantify the deviation on conformal mapping in terms of both boundary variation and non-isometric defor-  mation. [sent-41, score-0.875]
</p><p>19 Furthermore, once we have the distortion estimation of conformal maps, we can reduce the search range for matching the feature points of two surfaces, which will improve the efficiency and accuracy of surface registration. [sent-42, score-1.042]
</p><p>20 This work presents upper bound estimation on distortions of conformal maps caused by surface boundary variations and non-isometric deformations. [sent-43, score-1.082]
</p><p>21 These theoretical results are not classical, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to give rigorous theoretical upper bound estimation on distortion ofconformal maps in the above cases. [sent-44, score-0.43]
</p><p>22 The framework of surface registration based on conformal mapping is as follows. [sent-46, score-1.044]
</p><p>23 First we conformally map both of them to the unit disk φk : Sk → D, k = 1,2. [sent-48, score-0.3]
</p><p>24 If we can find a mapping between these two planar images φ˜ : D → D, then the registration can be obtained as φ = ◦ φ˜ ◦ φ1 . [sent-49, score-0.286]
</p><p>25 The angle distortion K of a quasiconformal map is defined as −  K = ? [sent-60, score-0.559]
</p><p>26 Conformal map is a special case of quasiconformal map whose μ is zero everywhere. [sent-64, score-0.323]
</p><p>27 Our task is to estimate the upper bound of the differences between two images of the same point p ∈ Ω in terms of both boundary variations ε1 ,ε2 and the angle distortion K, |φ1 (p)  −  φ2(p) | < g(ε1 ,ε2, K) ,∀p ∈ Ω. [sent-67, score-0.466]
</p><p>28 By applying geometric methods from quasiconformal geometry and harmonic analysis, we give the explicit upper bound g(ε1 ,ε2, K), which is a linear function of both εk’s and K (see Theorems 3. [sent-68, score-0.455]
</p><p>29 In this work, we estimate the distortions of conformal mappings both theoretically and experimentally. [sent-73, score-0.819]
</p><p>30 We present three main theorems, along with rigorous proofs based on quasiconformal geometry, which state the upper bounds of distortion with respect to the boundary variation and non-isometric deformation. [sent-74, score-0.817]
</p><p>31 We then utilize the distortion bound for feature registration purposes. [sent-75, score-0.462]
</p><p>32 Quantify the distortion of conformal mappings caused by boundary variation. [sent-78, score-1.134]
</p><p>33 Quantify the distortion of conformal mappings caused by non-isometric deformations. [sent-80, score-1.003]
</p><p>34 Present a registration algorithm which searches corre-  sponding features in the given distortion range. [sent-82, score-0.399]
</p><p>35 The quasiconformal mapping is uniquely determined by μ up to a conformal transformation, which is stated in the classical measurable Riemann mapping theorem [1]. [sent-99, score-1.254]
</p><p>36 Then there exists a quasiconformal homeomorphism f : → D, whose Beltrami coefficient is μ. [sent-105, score-0.436]
</p><p>37 Ω  Namely, the space of quasiconformal homeomorphism (QCH) between and D and the functional space of Beltrami coefficients have the following relation  Ω  QCH(S,D)/{M o¨bius}  ∼= {μ|μ : S → C, ? [sent-107, score-0.362]
</p><p>38 It conformally deforms the Riemannian metric and converges to constant curvature metric [5, 10]. [sent-114, score-0.286]
</p><p>39 Then, depending on the topology of S, it can be conformally deformed to one of three canonical shapes: the unit sphere S2, the flat torus R2/Γ (Γ is a subgroup of Euclidean translation), or H2/Γ  (Γ is a subgroup of hyperbolic rigid motion group). [sent-117, score-0.239]
</p><p>40 This shows that for surfaces with Riemannian metrics, we can find a conformal atlas {(Uα, φα)}, such that all the chart transitions φαβ : φα (Uα Uβ ) → φβ (Uα Uβ ) are the elements in Γ, which are planar conformal mappings. [sent-118, score-1.261]
</p><p>41 The pullback metric induced by φ on Ω is  φ∗|dw|2  =  |wz|2|dz+μd z¯|2,  therefore, the pullback metric is conformal to the auxiliary metric |dz + μd¯ z|2. [sent-124, score-0.882]
</p><p>42 3 (Auxiliary Metric) A quasiconformal mapping associated with Beltrami coefficient μ becomes a conformal mapping under the auxiliary metric, φ : (Ω, |dz|2,μ) → (D, |dw|2) ≡ φ : (Ω, |dz+μd¯ z|2) → (D, |dw|2). [sent-126, score-1.233]
</p><p>43 We use concepts from harmonic measure [9] and quasiconformal geometry [1] to obtain the distortion bounds. [sent-129, score-0.57]
</p><p>44 Boundary Variation We first estimate the distortion arising due to inconsistent boundaries. [sent-132, score-0.262]
</p><p>45 The conformal mappings of the scanned static faces might be almost identical except that their boundaries do not really match. [sent-133, score-0.795]
</p><p>46 One then needs to estimate how much the conformal mapping of one surface differs from another. [sent-134, score-0.859]
</p><p>47 In the first case the boundary of one surface is contained in the other. [sent-136, score-0.312]
</p><p>48 Let φ : −→ D be the Riemann mapping which fixes the origin and (the continuous extension of φ to the boundary of Ω) maps the point p = Γ ∩ R+ (note that star-shaped property of Γ implies uniqueness of p) to the point 1. [sent-144, score-0.256]
</p><p>49 The proof is based on harmonic measure and its invariance under conformal changes. [sent-152, score-0.61]
</p><p>50 Distortion estimation of conformal mappings between two surfaces S1,S2 with big overlapping region Ω. [sent-159, score-0.864]
</p><p>51 Non-isometric Deformation We then estimate the magnitude and argument changes for a point inside a domain under the action of a quasiconformal map, usually induced by a non-isometric deformation. [sent-181, score-0.375]
</p><p>52 As previously mentioned, quasiconformal maps intuitively distort angles by a bounded amount. [sent-182, score-0.323]
</p><p>53 This distortion  is encoded in the Beltrami coefficient μ of the map. [sent-183, score-0.288]
</p><p>54 By the Riemann mapping theorem, all simply connected domains are conformally equivalent to the unit disk D. [sent-184, score-0.401]
</p><p>55 without loss of generality, we just study the distortion caused by a quasiconformal mapping on the unit disk. [sent-185, score-0.726]
</p><p>56 Assume that all quasiconformal mappings f : D → D are normalized, i. [sent-186, score-0.503]
</p><p>57 The distortion estimation is based on the deformation theorem for quasiconformal mappings [1]. [sent-197, score-0.921]
</p><p>58 The bound of the deformation velocity field |V(t, z) | can be estimated, whose integration along t gives the bound of the distortion |h(1,z) −h(0, z) |, namely, |f(z) −z| . [sent-200, score-0.428]
</p><p>59 The discrete conformal factor is defined as a function λ : V → R. [sent-210, score-0.599]
</p><p>60 Quasiconformal Mapping by Auxiliary Metric We apply the quasiconformal mapping algorithm based  on the auxiliary metric of Theorem 2. [sent-220, score-0.538]
</p><p>61 The discrete surface Ricci flow algorithm takes the Riemannian metric as input. [sent-223, score-0.292]
</p><p>62 Here we use the auxiliary metric to replace the original induced Euclidean metric of the surface, then computing a quasiconformal mapping becomes computing a conformal mapping. [sent-224, score-1.197]
</p><p>63 Algorithm 1Auxiliary Metric Input: Triangular mesh M = (V,E,F) with conformal parameterization z : V → C, and discrete Beltrami coefficient μ : V → C defined on the conformal structure. [sent-225, score-1.27]
</p><p>64 This  work gives the upper theoretical bound for the search range (distortion) estimation in terms of two parameters: 1) the boundary difference represented by ε; 2) the geometric difference represented by μ. [sent-233, score-0.328]
</p><p>65 In this section, we verify the distortion theorems and evaluate the performance for dynamic feature registration and tracking application by running experiments on 3D human facial scans with dynamic expressions and inconsistent boundaries. [sent-236, score-0.762]
</p><p>66 If we fix the subject and change the expression, then the physical real mapping between the facial surfaces can be fully recovered by its local angle distortion μ; if we change the subject, then the best matching between two faces also gives the μ. [sent-238, score-0.531]
</p><p>67 Then, we apply the distortion upper bounds for feature registration using the boundary variation and non-isometric deformation parameters obtained from our experiments. [sent-257, score-0.714]
</p><p>68 Static Surface with Boundary Variation Figure 3 shows the input face surface (a), which is conformally mapped to the planar unit disk (b). [sent-260, score-0.533]
</p><p>69 We conformally map all Sk’s to the unit disk with normalization condition, φk : Sk → D. [sent-263, score-0.3]
</p><p>70 The measurements of all the boundary points on conformal mappings are plotted in (d), which is consistent with the distortion estimation theorem on boundary containment (see Theorem 3. [sent-266, score-1.412]
</p><p>71 In addition, Figure 4 illustrates the conformal mappings in the top row, and shows the deformation vector fields φk(zj) φ0(zj) of a set of feature points zj ∈ Sk in the bottom row. [sent-268, score-0.953]

</p><p>78 The distortion curve is plotted in (e), which is consistent with the distortion estimation theorem on non-isometric deformation (see Theorem 3. [sent-296, score-0.656]
</p><p>79 We track the face sequence using the algorithm in [24], then compute the Beltrami coefficients for each Sk using S0 as the reference surface, fk : S0 → Sk, and measure the distortion maxz∈D |fk(z) −z| . [sent-301, score-0.245]
</p><p>80 Dynamic Surfaces with Inconsistent Boundary We capture the dynamic facial surface sequence {Sk} with both expression and pose changes (scanning speed is 30 fps [21]), as shown in Fig. [sent-308, score-0.344]
</p><p>81 The facial surface sequence obtained includes both inconsistent boundaries and non-isometric expression deformations (the boundary changes are caused by head rotation, and human facial expressions are non-isometric [23]). [sent-310, score-0.698]
</p><p>82 We then compute the normalized conformal mappings φk : Sk → D as described 2637  (a)3Dsurface(b)μ0(z)=0(c)μ0. [sent-311, score-0.757]

</p><p>85 The sparse feature points on face Sk are computed first [23]; the generated correspondences are used as ground truth for evaluating the registration accuracy of our feature registration method. [sent-343, score-0.401]
</p><p>86 Frames (a) and (b) show two facial scans, with big boundary change and a nonisometric expression change, (c) shows the search range for all feature points on the source surface, and (d) shows the displacements of the matched feature points. [sent-345, score-0.338]
</p><p>87 By using the proposed distortion estimation, the efficiency for matching has been improved by 5 times, compared with a conformal mapping based registration method using heuristic search range [27]. [sent-349, score-1.147]
</p><p>88 For dynamic facial surfaces with expressions, if the scanning speed is fast, then the norm bound is small; if face expression matching has been done many times, then the norm bound can be learned. [sent-353, score-0.532]
</p><p>89 To the best of our knowledge, till today, this is the on-  ly work which gives the distortion estimations of conformal mappings with respect to the variation of boundary and the norm bound of Beltrami coefficient, along with rigorous mathematical proofs. [sent-358, score-1.261]
</p><p>90 We have tested a broader range of examples on 4 facial sequences with various expression and pose changes (each sequence has 400 frames) and sampled totally 200 pairs of surfaces for computing the distortions of conformal mappings; the experimental results validate the theoretical results. [sent-359, score-0.943]
</p><p>91 Conclusion The accuracy and stability of surface registration based on conformal mapping method depends on the boundary consistency and the non-isometric deformation. [sent-361, score-1.175]
</p><p>92 Conformal mapping changes when both the boundary and expression vary. [sent-363, score-0.289]
</p><p>93 (c) shows the search range for each feature point of (a), where the red and blue dots denote the feature points of (a) and (b), respectively; the yellow circle illustrates the search range for each feature point of (a) on conformal mapping domain (a unit disk) with the search radius 0. [sent-365, score-0.888]
</p><p>94 work, we estimate the distortions of conformal mappings theoretically and experimentally. [sent-368, score-0.819]
</p><p>95 We quantify the distortions of conformal mappings caused by both boundary variation and non-isometric deformations. [sent-369, score-1.048]
</p><p>96 The main theorems claim that the distortions are linear functions of the upper bound of the boundary variation and non-isometric deformation parameters. [sent-370, score-0.487]

<p>Author: Wei Zeng, Mayank Goswami, Feng Luo, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Surface registration plays a fundamental role in many applications in computer vision and aims at finding a oneto-one correspondence between surfaces. Conformal mapping based surface registration methods conformally map 2D/3D surfaces onto 2D canonical domains and perform the matching on the 2D plane. This registration framework reduces dimensionality, and the result is intrinsic to Riemannian metric and invariant under isometric deformation. However, conformal mapping will be affected by inconsistent boundaries and non-isometric deformations of surfaces. In this work, we quantify the effects of boundary variation and non-isometric deformation to conformal mappings, and give the theoretical upper bounds for the distortions of conformal mappings under these two factors. Besides giving the thorough theoretical proofs of the theorems, we verified them by concrete experiments using 3D human facial scans with dynamic expressions and varying boundaries. Furthermore, we used the distortion estimates for reducing search range in feature matching of surface registration applications.

<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Xianfeng Gu, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dense non-rigid 3D surface registration, which brings together Riemannian geometry and graphical models. To this end, we first introduce a generic deformation model, called Canonical Distortion Coefficients (CDCs), by characterizing the deformation of every point on a surface using the distortions along its two principle directions. This model subsumes the deformation groups commonly used in surface registration such as isometry and conformality, and is able to handle more complex deformations. We also derive its discrete counterpart which can be computed very efficiently in a closed form. Based on these, we introduce a higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) model which seamlessly integrates our deformation model and a geometry/texture similarity metric. Then we jointly establish the optimal correspondences for all the points via maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Moreover, we develop a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently perform the inference for the proposed higher-order MRF model. The resulting registration algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both dense non-rigid 3D surface registration and tracking.</p><p>3 0.15369742 <a title="183-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Accurate_and_Robust_3D_Facial_Capture_Using_a_Single_RGBD_Camera.html">36 iccv-2013-Accurate and Robust 3D Facial Capture Using a Single RGBD Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Yen-Lin Chen, Hsiang-Tao Wu, Fuhao Shi, Xin Tong, Jinxiang Chai</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an automatic and robust approach that accurately captures high-quality 3D facial performances using a single RGBD camera. The key of our approach is to combine the power of automatic facial feature detection and image-based 3D nonrigid registration techniques for 3D facial reconstruction. In particular, we develop a robust and accurate image-based nonrigid registration algorithm that incrementally deforms a 3D template mesh model to best match observed depth image data and important facial features detected from single RGBD images. The whole process is fully automatic and robust because it is based on single frame facial registration framework. The system is flexible because it does not require any strong 3D facial priors such as blendshape models. We demonstrate the power of our approach by capturing a wide range of 3D facial expressions using a single RGBD camera and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy by comparing against alternative methods.</p><p>4 0.12547261 <a title="183-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Elastic_Fragments_for_Dense_Scene_Reconstruction.html">139 iccv-2013-Elastic Fragments for Dense Scene Reconstruction</a></p>
<p>Author: Qian-Yi Zhou, Stephen Miller, Vladlen Koltun</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to reconstruction of detailed scene geometry from range video. Range data produced by commodity handheld cameras suffers from high-frequency errors and low-frequency distortion. Our approach deals with both sources of error by reconstructing locally smooth scene fragments and letting these fragments deform in order to align to each other. We develop a volumetric registration formulation that leverages the smoothness of the deformation to make optimization practical for large scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially increases the fidelity of complex scene geometry reconstructed with commodity handheld cameras.</p><p>5 0.12044571 <a title="183-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Automatic_Registration_of_RGB-D_Scans_via_Salient_Directions.html">56 iccv-2013-Automatic Registration of RGB-D Scans via Salient Directions</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernhard Zeisl, Kevin Köser, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of wide-baseline registration of RGB-D data, such as photo-textured laser scans without any artificial targets or prediction on the relative motion. Our approach allows to fully automatically register scans taken in GPS-denied environments such as urban canyon, industrial facilities or even indoors. We build upon image features which are plenty, localized well and much more discriminative than geometry features; however, they suffer from viewpoint distortions and request for normalization. We utilize the principle of salient directions present in the geometry and propose to extract (several) directions from the distribution of surface normals or other cues such as observable symmetries. Compared to previous work we pose no requirements on the scanned scene (like containing large textured planes) and can handle arbitrary surface shapes. Rendering the whole scene from these repeatable directions using an orthographic camera generates textures which are identical up to 2D similarity transformations. This ambiguity is naturally handled by 2D features and allows to find stable correspondences among scans. For geometric pose estimation from tentative matches we propose a fast and robust 2 point sample consensus scheme integrating an early rejection phase. We evaluate our approach on different challenging real world scenes.</p><p>6 0.10794901 <a title="183-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Elastic_Net_Constraints_for_Shape_Matching.html">140 iccv-2013-Elastic Net Constraints for Shape Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Wei Zeng, Mayank Goswami, Feng Luo, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Surface registration plays a fundamental role in many applications in computer vision and aims at finding a oneto-one correspondence between surfaces. Conformal mapping based surface registration methods conformally map 2D/3D surfaces onto 2D canonical domains and perform the matching on the 2D plane.

<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Xianfeng Gu, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dense non-rigid 3D surface registration, which brings together Riemannian geometry and graphical models. To this end, we first introduce a generic deformation model, called Canonical Distortion Coefficients (CDCs), by characterizing the deformation of every point on a surface using the distortions along its two principle directions. This model subsumes the deformation groups commonly used in surface registration such as isometry and conformality, and is able to handle more complex deformations. We also derive its discrete counterpart which can be computed very efficiently in a closed form. Based on these, we introduce a higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) model which seamlessly integrates our deformation model and a geometry/texture similarity metric. Then we jointly establish the optimal correspondences for all the points via maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Moreover, we develop a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently perform the inference for the proposed higher-order MRF model. The resulting registration algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both dense non-rigid 3D surface registration and tracking.</p><p>3 0.64916605 <a title="183-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Elastic_Fragments_for_Dense_Scene_Reconstruction.html">139 iccv-2013-Elastic Fragments for Dense Scene Reconstruction</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiaolong Yang, Hongdong Li, Yunde Jia</p><p>Abstract: Registration is a fundamental task in computer vision. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is one of the widely-used methods for solving the registration problem. Based on local iteration, ICP is however well-known to suffer from local minima. Its performance critically relies on the quality of initialization, and only local optimality is guaranteed. This paper provides the very first globally optimal solution to Euclidean registration of two 3D pointsets or two 3D surfaces under the L2 error. Our method is built upon ICP, but combines it with a branch-and-bound (BnB) scheme which searches the 3D motion space SE(3) efficiently. By exploiting the special structure of the underlying geometry, we derive novel upper and lower bounds for the ICP error function. The integration of local ICP and global BnB enables the new method to run efficiently in practice, and its optimality is exactly guaranteed. We also discuss extensions, addressing the issue of outlier robustness.</p><p>5 0.62430489 <a title="183-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Hierarchical_Data-Driven_Descent_for_Efficient_Optimal_Deformation_Estimation.html">196 iccv-2013-Hierarchical Data-Driven Descent for Efficient Optimal Deformation Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuandong Tian, Srinivasa G. Narasimhan</p><p>Abstract: Real-world surfaces such as clothing, water and human body deform in complex ways. The image distortions observed are high-dimensional and non-linear, making it hard to estimate these deformations accurately. The recent datadriven descent approach [17] applies Nearest Neighbor estimators iteratively on a particular distribution of training samples to obtain a globally optimal and dense deformation field between a template and a distorted image. In this work, we develop a hierarchical structure for the Nearest Neighbor estimators, each of which can have only a local image support. We demonstrate in both theory and practice that this algorithm has several advantages over the nonhierarchical version: it guarantees global optimality with significantly fewer training samples, is several orders faster, provides a metric to decide whether a given image is “hard” (or “easy ”) requiring more (or less) samples, and can handle more complex scenes that include both global motion and local deformation. The proposed algorithm successfully tracks a broad range of non-rigid scenes including water, clothing, and medical images, and compares favorably against several other deformation estimation and tracking approaches that do not provide optimality guarantees.</p><p>6 0.62032288 <a title="183-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Multiple_Non-rigid_Surface_Detection_and_Registration.html">283 iccv-2013-Multiple Non-rigid Surface Detection and Registration</a></p>

<p>Author: Junchi Yan, Yu Tian, Hongyuan Zha, Xiaokang Yang, Ya Zhang, Stephen M. Chu</p><p>Abstract: The problem of graph matching in general is NP-hard and approaches have been proposed for its suboptimal solution, most focusing on finding the one-to-one node mapping between two graphs. A more general and challenging problem arises when one aims to find consistent mappings across a number of graphs more than two. Conventional graph pair matching methods often result in mapping inconsistency since the mapping between two graphs can either be determined by pair mapping or by an additional anchor graph. To address this issue, a novel formulation is derived which is maximized via alternating optimization. Our method enjoys several advantages: 1) the mappings are jointly optimized rather than sequentially performed by applying pair matching, allowing the global affinity information across graphs can be propagated and explored; 2) the number of concerned variables to optimize is in linear with the number of graphs, being superior to local pair matching resulting in O(n2) variables; 3) the mapping consistency constraints are analytically satisfied during optimization; and 4) off-the-shelf graph pair matching solvers can be reused under the proposed framework in an ‘out-of-thebox’ fashion. Competitive results on both the synthesized data and the real data are reported, by varying the level of deformation, outliers and edge densities. ∗Corresponding author.

<p>Author: Maxime Meilland, Tom Drummond, Andrew I. Comport</p><p>Abstract: Motion blur and rolling shutter deformations both inhibit visual motion registration, whether it be due to a moving sensor or a moving target. Whilst both deformations exist simultaneously, no models have been proposed to handle them together. Furthermore, neither deformation has been consideredpreviously in the context of monocularfullimage 6 degrees of freedom registration or RGB-D structure and motion. As will be shown, rolling shutter deformation is observed when a camera moves faster than a single pixel in parallax between subsequent scan-lines. Blur is a function of the pixel exposure time and the motion vector. In this paper a complete dense 3D registration model will be derived to accountfor both motion blur and rolling shutter deformations simultaneously. Various approaches will be compared with respect to ground truth and live real-time performance will be demonstratedfor complex scenarios where both blur and shutter deformations are dominant.</p><p>4 0.81593424 <a title="183-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Rolling_Shutter_Stereo.html">363 iccv-2013-Rolling Shutter Stereo</a></p>
<p>Author: Olivier Saurer, Kevin Köser, Jean-Yves Bouguet, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: A huge fraction of cameras used nowadays is based on CMOS sensors with a rolling shutter that exposes the image line by line. For dynamic scenes/cameras this introduces undesired effects like stretch, shear and wobble. It has been shown earlier that rotational shake induced rolling shutter effects in hand-held cell phone capture can be compensated based on an estimate of the camera rotation. In contrast, we analyse the case of significant camera motion, e.g. where a bypassing streetlevel capture vehicle uses a rolling shutter camera in a 3D reconstruction framework. The introduced error is depth dependent and cannot be compensated based on camera motion/rotation alone, invalidating also rectification for stereo camera systems. On top, significant lens distortion as often present in wide angle cameras intertwines with rolling shutter effects as it changes the time at which a certain 3D point is seen. We show that naive 3D reconstructions (assuming global shutter) will deliver biased geometry already for very mild assumptions on vehicle speed and resolution. We then develop rolling shutter dense multiview stereo algorithms that solve for time of exposure and depth at the same time, even in the presence of lens distortion and perform an evaluation on ground truth laser scan models as well as on real street-level data.</p><p>5 0.80616713 <a title="183-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Subspace_Stabilization_for_Stereoscopic_Video.html">226 iccv-2013-Joint Subspace Stabilization for Stereoscopic Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Feng Liu, Yuzhen Niu, Hailin Jin</p><p>Abstract: Shaky stereoscopic video is not only unpleasant to watch but may also cause 3D fatigue. Stabilizing the left and right view of a stereoscopic video separately using a monocular stabilization method tends to both introduce undesirable vertical disparities and damage horizontal disparities, which may destroy the stereoscopic viewing experience. In this paper, we present a joint subspace stabilization method for stereoscopic video. We prove that the low-rank subspace constraint for monocular video [10] also holds for stereoscopic video. Particularly, the feature trajectories from the left and right video share the same subspace. Based on this proof, we develop a stereo subspace stabilization method that jointly computes a common subspace from the left and right video and uses it to stabilize the two videos simultaneously. Our method meets the stereoscopic constraints without 3D reconstruction or explicit left-right correspondence. We test our method on a variety of stereoscopic videos with different scene content and camera motion. The experiments show that our method achieves high-quality stabilization for stereoscopic video in a robust and efficient way.</p><p>6 0.79336512 <a title="183-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_New_Image_Quality_Metric_for_Image_Auto-denoising.html">23 iccv-2013-A New Image Quality Metric for Image Auto-denoising</a></p>

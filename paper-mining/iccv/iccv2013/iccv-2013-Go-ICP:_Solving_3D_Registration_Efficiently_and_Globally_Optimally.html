<p>Author: Yen-Lin Chen, Hsiang-Tao Wu, Fuhao Shi, Xin Tong, Jinxiang Chai</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an automatic and robust approach that accurately captures high-quality 3D facial performances using a single RGBD camera. The key of our approach is to combine the power of automatic facial feature detection and image-based 3D nonrigid registration techniques for 3D facial reconstruction. In particular, we develop a robust and accurate image-based nonrigid registration algorithm that incrementally deforms a 3D template mesh model to best match observed depth image data and important facial features detected from single RGBD images. The whole process is fully automatic and robust because it is based on single frame facial registration framework. The system is flexible because it does not require any strong 3D facial priors such as blendshape models. We demonstrate the power of our approach by capturing a wide range of 3D facial expressions using a single RGBD camera and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy by comparing against alternative methods.</p><p>3 0.090744078 <a title="185-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Global_Fusion_of_Relative_Motions_for_Robust%2C_Accurate_and_Scalable_Structure_from_Motion.html">184 iccv-2013-Global Fusion of Relative Motions for Robust, Accurate and Scalable Structure from Motion</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Moulon, Pascal Monasse, Renaud Marlet</p><p>Abstract: Multi-view structure from motion (SfM) estimates the position and orientation of pictures in a common 3D coordinate frame. When views are treated incrementally, this external calibration can be subject to drift, contrary to global methods that distribute residual errors evenly. We propose a new global calibration approach based on the fusion of relative motions between image pairs. We improve an existing method for robustly computing global rotations. We present an efficient a contrario trifocal tensor estimation method, from which stable and precise translation directions can be extracted. We also define an efficient translation registration method that recovers accurate camera positions. These components are combined into an original SfM pipeline. Our experiments show that, on most datasets, it outperforms in accuracy other existing incremental and global pipelines. It also achieves strikingly good running times: it is about 20 times faster than the other global method we could compare to, and as fast as the best incremental method. More importantly, it features better scalability properties.</p><p>4 0.080838628 <a title="185-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Kneip, Simon Lynen</p><p>Abstract: This work makes use of a novel, recently proposed epipolar constraint for computing the relative pose between two calibrated images. By enforcing the coplanarity of epipolar plane normal vectors, it constrains the three degrees of freedom of the relative rotation between two camera views directly—independently of the translation. The present paper shows how the approach can be extended to n points, and translated into an efficient eigenvalue minimization over the three rotational degrees of freedom. Each iteration in the non-linear optimization has constant execution time, independently of the number of features. Two global optimization approaches are proposed. The first one consists of an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt scheme with randomized initial value, which already leads to stable and accurate results. The second scheme consists of a globally optimal branch-and-bound algorithm based on a bound on the eigenvalue variation derived from symmetric eigenvalue-perturbation theory. Analysis of the cost function reveals insights into the nature of a specific relative pose problem, and outlines the complexity under different conditions. The algorithm shows state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. essential-matrix based solutions, and a frameto-frame application to a video sequence immediately leads to an alternative, real-time visual odometry solution.

<p>Author: Bernhard Zeisl, Kevin Köser, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of wide-baseline registration of RGB-D data, such as photo-textured laser scans without any artificial targets or prediction on the relative motion. Our approach allows to fully automatically register scans taken in GPS-denied environments such as urban canyon, industrial facilities or even indoors. We build upon image features which are plenty, localized well and much more discriminative than geometry features; however, they suffer from viewpoint distortions and request for normalization. We utilize the principle of salient directions present in the geometry and propose to extract (several) directions from the distribution of surface normals or other cues such as observable symmetries. Compared to previous work we pose no requirements on the scanned scene (like containing large textured planes) and can handle arbitrary surface shapes. Rendering the whole scene from these repeatable directions using an orthographic camera generates textures which are identical up to 2D similarity transformations. This ambiguity is naturally handled by 2D features and allows to find stable correspondences among scans. For geometric pose estimation from tentative matches we propose a fast and robust 2 point sample consensus scheme integrating an early rejection phase. We evaluate our approach on different challenging real world scenes.</p><p>6 0.066495322 <a title="185-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Content-Aware_Rotation.html">90 iccv-2013-Content-Aware Rotation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kaiming He, Huiwen Chang, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: We present an image editing tool called Content-Aware Rotation. Casually shot photos can appear tilted, and are often corrected by rotation and cropping. This trivial solution may remove desired content and hurt image integrity. Instead of doing rigid rotation, we propose a warping method that creates the perception of rotation and avoids cropping. Human vision studies suggest that the perception of rotation is mainly due to horizontal/vertical lines. We design an optimization-based method that preserves the rotation of horizontal/vertical lines, maintains the completeness of the image content, and reduces the warping distortion. An efficient algorithm is developed to address the challenging optimization. We demonstrate our content-aware rotation method on a variety of practical cases.</p><p>3 0.78621036 <a title="185-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_and_Robust_Large-Scale_Rotation_Averaging.html">138 iccv-2013-Efficient and Robust Large-Scale Rotation Averaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Avishek Chatterjee, Venu Madhav Govindu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of robust and efficient averaging of relative 3D rotations. Apart from having an interesting geometric structure, robust rotation averaging addresses the need for a good initialization for largescale optimization used in structure-from-motion pipelines. Such pipelines often use unstructured image datasets harvested from the internet thereby requiring an initialization method that is robust to outliers. Our approach works on the Lie group structure of 3D rotations and solves the problem of large-scale robust rotation averaging in two ways. Firstly, we use modern ?1 optimizers to carry out robust averaging of relative rotations that is efficient, scalable and robust to outliers. In addition, we also develop a twostep method that uses the ?1 solution as an initialisation for an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach. These methods achieve excellent results on large-scale, real world datasets and significantly outperform existing methods, i.e. the state-of-the-art discrete-continuous optimization method of [3] as well as the Weiszfeld method of [8]. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two large- scale real world datasets and also provide the results of the two aforementioned methods for comparison.</p><p>4 0.72869164 <a title="185-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>

These tasks require afundamental tool called parallel transport of tangent vectors along arbitrary paths. This tool is essential for: (1) computation of geodesic paths using either shooting or path-straightening method, (2) transferring deformations across objects, and (3) modeling of statistical variability in shapes. Using the square-root normal field (SRNF) representation of parameterized surfaces, we present a method for transporting deformations along paths in the shape space. This is difficult despite the underlying space being a vector space because the chosen (elastic) Riemannian metric is non-standard. Using a finite-basis for representing SRNFs of shapes, we derive expressions for Christoffel symbols that enable parallel transports. We demonstrate this framework using examples from shape analysis of parameterized spherical sur- faces, in the three contexts mentioned above.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.65462774 <a title="185-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Go-ICP%3A_Solving_3D_Registration_Efficiently_and_Globally_Optimally.html">185 iccv-2013-Go-ICP: Solving 3D Registration Efficiently and Globally Optimally</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiaolong Yang, Hongdong Li, Yunde Jia</p><p>Abstract: Registration is a fundamental task in computer vision. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is one of the widely-used methods for solving the registration problem. Based on local iteration, ICP is however well-known to suffer from local minima. Its performance critically relies on the quality of initialization, and only local optimality is guaranteed. This paper provides the very first globally optimal solution to Euclidean registration of two 3D pointsets or two 3D surfaces under the L2 error. Our method is built upon ICP, but combines it with a branch-and-bound (BnB) scheme which searches the 3D motion space SE(3) efficiently. By exploiting the special structure of the underlying geometry, we derive novel upper and lower bounds for the ICP error function. The integration of local ICP and global BnB enables the new method to run efficiently in practice, and its optimality is exactly guaranteed. We also discuss extensions, addressing the issue of outlier robustness.</p><p>3 0.6107446 <a title="185-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Cascaded_Shape_Space_Pruning_for_Robust_Facial_Landmark_Detection.html">70 iccv-2013-Cascaded Shape Space Pruning for Robust Facial Landmark Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaowei Zhao, Shiguang Shan, Xiujuan Chai, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel cascaded face shape space pruning algorithm for robust facial landmark detection. Through progressively excluding the incorrect candidate shapes, our algorithm can accurately and efficiently achieve the globally optimal shape configuration. Specifically, individual landmark detectors are firstly applied to eliminate wrong candidates for each landmark. Then, the candidate shape space is further pruned by jointly removing incorrect shape configurations. To achieve this purpose, a discriminative structure classifier is designed to assess the candidate shape configurations. Based on the learned discriminative structure classifier, an efficient shape space pruning strategy is proposed to quickly reject most incorrect candidate shapes while preserve the true shape. The proposed algorithm is carefully evaluated on a large set of real world face images. In addition, comparison results on the publicly available BioID and LFW face databases demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><p>4 0.59512603 <a title="185-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Internet_Based_Morphable_Model.html">219 iccv-2013-Internet Based Morphable Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman</p><p>Abstract: In thispaper wepresent a new concept ofbuilding a morphable model directly from photos on the Internet. Morphable models have shown very impressive results more than a decade ago, and could potentially have a huge impact on all aspects of face modeling and recognition. One of the challenges, however, is to capture and register 3D laser scans of large number of people and facial expressions. Nowadays, there are enormous amounts of face photos on the Internet, large portion of which has semantic labels. We propose a framework to build a morphable model directly from photos, the framework includes dense registration of Internet photos, as well as, new single view shape reconstruction and modification algorithms.</p><p>5 0.57473075 <a title="185-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Semantically-Based_Human_Scanpath_Estimation_with_HMMs.html">381 iccv-2013-Semantically-Based Human Scanpath Estimation with HMMs</a></p>
<p>Author: Huiying Liu, Dong Xu, Qingming Huang, Wen Li, Min Xu, Stephen Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for estimating human scanpaths, which are sequences of gaze shifts that follow visual attention over an image. In this work, scanpaths are modeled based on three principal factors that influence human attention, namely low-levelfeature saliency, spatialposition, and semantic content. Low-level feature saliency is formulated as transition probabilities between different image regions based on feature differences. The effect of spatial position on gaze shifts is modeled as a Levy flight with the shifts following a 2D Cauchy distribution. To account for semantic content, we propose to use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a Bag-of-Visual-Words descriptor of image regions. An HMM is well-suited for this purpose in that 1) the hidden states, obtained by unsupervised learning, can represent latent semantic concepts, 2) the prior distribution of the hidden states describes visual attraction to the semantic concepts, and 3) the transition probabilities represent human gaze shift patterns. The proposed method is applied to task-driven viewing processes. Experiments and analysis performed on human eye gaze data verify the effectiveness of this method.</p><p>6 0.57009351 <a title="185-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Exemplar-Based_Graph_Matching_for_Robust_Facial_Landmark_Localization.html">149 iccv-2013-Exemplar-Based Graph Matching for Robust Facial Landmark Localization</a></p>

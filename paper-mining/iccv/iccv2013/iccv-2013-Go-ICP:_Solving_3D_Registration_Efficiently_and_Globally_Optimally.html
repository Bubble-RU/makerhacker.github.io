</p><p>6 This paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the very first that proposes a truly globally optimal solution to ICP type  Euclidean registration in 3D. [sent-27, score-0.378]
</p><p>7 It provides guaranteed optimality without the need for a good initialization. [sent-28, score-0.112]
</p><p>8 We have conducted extensive tests on both synthetic data and real data; satisfactory results (both in terms of theoretical optimality and computational efficiency) are obtained for all tests. [sent-34, score-0.11]
</p><p>9 Although Go-ICP is specifically designed for 3D Euclidean registration since we take advantage ofthe geometry of SE(3), the same techniques used in this paper may be inspiring for other cases as well (e. [sent-35, score-0.278]
</p><p>10 Below we only list a few most relevant works, that either aimed to achieve optimal ICP or, more generally, addressed optimality in Euclidean registration. [sent-43, score-0.13]
</p><p>11 To alleviate the local minima issue, previous work has attempted to enlarge the basin of convergence by smoothing out the objective function. [sent-45, score-0.105]
</p><p>12 particle swarm optimization [34] and particle filtering [32], to help the registration jump out of local minima. [sent-51, score-0.379]
</p><p>13 Registration methods that come with guaranteed optimality were published in the past, though in a smaller number. [sent-58, score-0.112]
</p><p>14 While being globally optimal, their method makes unrealistic assumption such as the two pointsets are of equal size and there is only pure rotation. [sent-64, score-0.13]
</p><p>15 Branch-and-bound based Euclidean registration was investigated in Olsson et al. [sent-65, score-0.26]
</p><p>16 [12] converted the registration problem to graph vertex cover and provided an optimal solution. [sent-68, score-0.299]
</p><p>17 spin image [19], shape contexts [4], EGI [24]) are mostly heuristic and do not address the optimality issue. [sent-72, score-0.134]
</p><p>18 [14] in which they proposed a globally optimal solution on top of the local descriptors. [sent-74, score-0.114]
</p><p>19 In this paper, we solve the 3D Euclidean registration problem with global optimality guarantee. [sent-78, score-0.371]
</p><p>20 For the case of optimal registration under L2-norm, few results are available. [sent-83, score-0.299]

</p><p>22 The aim is to estimate a rigid motion with rotation R ∈ SO(3) and translation t ∈ R3, which minimizes the following 3L)2 error Ean:s ? [sent-96, score-0.258]
</p><p>23 1  where ei (R, t) is the per-point residual error for xi. [sent-106, score-0.184]

</p><p>25 In order to apply BnB to 3D registration, one must first answer the following questions: (i) how to parameterize and branch the domain of 3D motions, (ii) how to efficiently find an upper bound and lower bound. [sent-129, score-0.188]
</p><p>26 For ease of manipulation, we use the minimum cube [−π, π]3 that encloses the tπio-bna,ll w as utshee t rhoeta mtiionni mduommai cnu. [sent-140, score-0.123]
</p><p>27 b eFo [−r tπh,eπ t]ranslation part, we assume the optimal translation must lie within a bounded cube [−ξ, ξ]3 which may be readily set by choosing a big ncuubmebe [−r as ξ]. [sent-141, score-0.253]
</p><p>28 During BnB searches, initial cubes will be subdivided into smaller sub-cubes Cr, Ct using the octree data-structure and the process is repeated. [sent-142, score-0.127]
</p><p>29 This way, our method enjoys both the efficiency provided by the local ICP search, and the optimality guaranteed by the BnB search. [sent-147, score-0.135]
</p><p>30 Derive New Bounding Functions As for any BnB method, finding quality bounds is the key to success. [sent-149, score-0.13]
</p><p>31 In our method, we need to find the bounds of the particular type of L2-norm error function used in ICP within a domain Cr Ct. [sent-150, score-0.203]
</p><p>32 Next, we will introduce the concept of uncertainty ×ra Cdius as a mathematical preparation, then derive our new bounds based on it. [sent-151, score-0.266]
</p><p>33 Uncertainty radius The intuition behind the concept of uncertainty radius is: we want to examine, if we perturb a 3D rigid motion with rotation r ∈ Cr and/or translation t ∈ Ct applied to a 3wDit point x, nw rh ∈at Cthe uncertainty region to f∈ t hCe transformed point will be. [sent-154, score-0.638]
</p><p>34 We aim to find a ball enclosing such an uncertainty region. [sent-155, score-0.174]
</p><p>35 maxX (a) Rotation uncertainty radius (b) Translation uncertainty radius Figure 1. [sent-158, score-0.358]
</p><p>36 Left: rotation uncertainty ball for Cr (in red) with center Rr0 x (blue dot) and radius γr. [sent-160, score-0.331]
</p><p>37 Right: translation uncertainty ball for Ct (in red) with center x + t0 (blue dot) and radius γt . [sent-161, score-0.322]
</p><p>38 In both diagrams, the uncertainty balls enclose the range of Rrx or x + t (in green). [sent-162, score-0.121]
</p><p>39 For a rotation cube Cr of half side-length σr with r0 as the center, examining the maximum distance from Rrx to Rr0x, we have ? [sent-165, score-0.204]
</p><p>40 Similarly, we can derive a translation uncertainty radius γt, for a translation cube Ct with half side-length σt centered at t0: ? [sent-199, score-0.482]
</p><p>41 Both uncertainty radii are used in deriving the lower bound for our method. [sent-208, score-0.317]
</p><p>42 Note that γr is point-dependent, therefore γri refers to the rotation uncertainty radius at xi. [sent-209, score-0.278]
</p><p>43 It is clear that a ≤ b ≤ c while a = ei and c = ei (Rr , t). [sent-212, score-0.206]
</p><p>44 Bounding the L2 error Given a 3D data point xi, a rotation cube Cr centered at r0 and a translation cube Ct centered at t0, an upper bound for the per-pixel residual error ei (R, t) within the cubes can be trivially found as  ei= ei(Rr0,t0) ? [sent-216, score-0.914]
</p><p>45 (6)  Finding a suitable lower bound for this L2 residual error appears to be a harder task, especially considering the domain is in SE(3). [sent-218, score-0.237]
</p><p>46 However, below we will show how a lower bound can be found, using the concept of uncertainty radius. [sent-219, score-0.27]
</p><p>47 (γri +γt) (9) = ei (Rr0 ,t0) −(γri +γt) , −  −  −  where Eq. [sent-240, score-0.103]
</p><p>48 Now we have reached a lower bound of the per-point residual for Cr Ct as  ei=max(ei(Rr0,t0)−(γri+γt),0)? [sent-249, score-0.164]
</p><p>49 (10) The geometric explanation of this lower bound is as follows. [sent-251, score-0.149]
</p><p>50 Since yj∗0 is the closest point to the center Rr0xi + t0 of the uncertainty ball with radius γ = γri +γt, it is also the closest point to (the surface of) the ball and ei is the closest distance between pointset Y and the ball. [sent-252, score-0.605]
</p><p>51 (Bounds of the L2 error) For a 3D motion domain Cr Ct centered at (r0, t0) with uncertainty radii γris and γt, ×theC upperboundE andthe lowerboundE ofthe optimal L2 registration error E∗ can be chosen as ? [sent-261, score-0.573]
</p><p>52 1  This result gives both the upper bound and lower bound of the registration error, based on which we developed our Go-ICP algorithm. [sent-279, score-0.505]
</p><p>53 An outer BnB searches the rotation space of SO(3), while solving the bounds and corresponding optimal translation by calling an inner translational BnB. [sent-284, score-0.46]
</p><p>54 The bounds for both BnB algorithms can be readily derived according to Sec. [sent-285, score-0.149]
</p><p>55 In the outer rotation BnB, for a cube Cr the bounds of the registration error can be chosen ? [sent-288, score-0.693]
</p><p>56 he bounds for a translation cube Ct can be chosen as Et = ? [sent-297, score-0.325]
</p><p>57 The nested BnB structure can be clearly seen: the outer BnB in Algorithm 1 calls the inner BnB in Algorithm 2. [sent-307, score-0.113]
</p><p>58 Once the difference between so-far-the-best error E∗ and the lower bound E of current cube is less than a threshold ? [sent-317, score-0.305]
</p><p>59 All we need to do is to show that, as the algorithm iterates, the gap between the lower bound and the upper bound converges uniformly to zero. [sent-321, score-0.245]
</p><p>60 This is easy to see, as when the side-lengths of all cubes asymptotically diminish to zero, the gap between the two bounds, i. [sent-322, score-0.104]
</p><p>61 To speed up the computation of inner BnB, we set the initial  Et∗ to be E∗ without loss of globally optimal registration based on the following insight. [sent-329, score-0.407]
</p><p>62 In other words, ≥if Ethe error Et∗ returned by the inner BnB is greater than or equal to so-far-the-best error E∗ in the outer BnB, it makes no contribution. [sent-332, score-0.183]
</p><p>63 Whenever the outer BnB finds a cube Cr which has an upper-bound lower than the so-farthe-best function value, it will then call the conventional ICP to start over, from the center of Cr and corresponding t∗ as the new initial transformation. [sent-337, score-0.231]
</p><p>64 Algorithm  2:  BnB  search  for  optimal  translation  given  Algorithm 2: BnB search for optimal translation given rotation Input: Data and model points; threshold ? [sent-341, score-0.43]
</p><p>65 ; initial cube Ct ; rotation r0 ; rotation uncertainty radii γr, so far the best error E∗ . [sent-342, score-0.56]
</p><p>66 LBenft:ICPBn anBdICP colabrtivelyupdateh uper  bounds during the search process. [sent-347, score-0.159]
</p><p>67 Right: with the guidance of BnB, ICP only explores un-discarded promising cubes with small lower bounds marked up by BnB. [sent-348, score-0.312]
</p><p>68 Instead of exploring the domain blindly, ICP con-  verges into local minima one by one with each local minimum having lower error than the previous one, and reaches the global minimum in the end. [sent-351, score-0.273]
</p><p>69 [5]), all points (transformation parameter r, t) in its search path should have error lower than E∗, which means that lower bounds of the cubes containing these points should be lower than E∗ . [sent-353, score-0.539]
</p><p>70 Thus the search path of the local ICP is entirely confined to the undiscarded, promising cubes with small lower bounds, as illustrated in Fig. [sent-354, score-0.211]
</p><p>71 This way, both the global BnB search and the local ICP search are intimately integrated in our method. [sent-356, score-0.101]
</p><p>72 The former not only helps the latter to jump out of local minima, but also provides a guidance for the latter’s next search; the latter accelerates the former’s convergence by refining the upper bound, hence improves the overall efficiency. [sent-357, score-0.139]

</p><p>80 Note that our goal is to minimize the L2 error while root-mean-square (RMS) error is reported for better comprehension. [sent-387, score-0.102]
</p><p>81 Visually inspected, our method yields a more satisfactory registration too. [sent-392, score-0.26]
</p><p>82 In our experiment, for example, to match 1000 data points to about 30,000–40,000 model points took about 30 seconds for bunny and 15 seconds for the hand. [sent-410, score-0.141]
</p><p>83 The global lower bound, which is the smallest lower bound of the cubes in the queue, is always close to zero because the globally optimal error is close to zero, which is true for the registration problem. [sent-416, score-0.753]

<p>Author: Jiaolong Yang, Hongdong Li, Yunde Jia</p><p>Abstract: Registration is a fundamental task in computer vision. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is one of the widely-used methods for solving the registration problem. Based on local iteration, ICP is however well-known to suffer from local minima. Its performance critically relies on the quality of initialization, and only local optimality is guaranteed. This paper provides the very first globally optimal solution to Euclidean registration of two 3D pointsets or two 3D surfaces under the L2 error. Our method is built upon ICP, but combines it with a branch-and-bound (BnB) scheme which searches the 3D motion space SE(3) efficiently. By exploiting the special structure of the underlying geometry, we derive novel upper and lower bounds for the ICP error function. The integration of local ICP and global BnB enables the new method to run efficiently in practice, and its optimality is exactly guaranteed. We also discuss extensions, addressing the issue of outlier robustness.</p><p>2 0.14980492 <a title="185-tfidf-2" href="./iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven_Efficiently-Sampled_Sparse_Graphical_Models_for_Concurrent_Tumor_Segmentation_and_Atlas_Registration.html">432 iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven Efficiently-Sampled Sparse Graphical Models for Concurrent Tumor Segmentation and Atlas Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Sarah Parisot, William Wells_III, Stéphane Chemouny, Hugues Duffau, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based methods have become popular in recent years and have successfully addressed tasks like segmentation and deformable registration. Their main strength is optimality of the obtained solution while their main limitation is the lack of precision due to the grid-like representations and the discrete nature of the quantized search space. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for combined segmentation/registration of brain tumors that adapts graph and sampling resolution according to the image content. To this end we estimate the segmentation and registration marginals towards adaptive graph resolution and intelligent definition of the search space. This information is considered in a hierarchical framework where uncertainties are propagated in a natural manner. State of the art results in the joint segmentation/registration of brain images with low-grade gliomas demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>3 0.13322507 <a title="185-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Accurate_and_Robust_3D_Facial_Capture_Using_a_Single_RGBD_Camera.html">36 iccv-2013-Accurate and Robust 3D Facial Capture Using a Single RGBD Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Yen-Lin Chen, Hsiang-Tao Wu, Fuhao Shi, Xin Tong, Jinxiang Chai</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an automatic and robust approach that accurately captures high-quality 3D facial performances using a single RGBD camera. The key of our approach is to combine the power of automatic facial feature detection and image-based 3D nonrigid registration techniques for 3D facial reconstruction. In particular, we develop a robust and accurate image-based nonrigid registration algorithm that incrementally deforms a 3D template mesh model to best match observed depth image data and important facial features detected from single RGBD images. The whole process is fully automatic and robust because it is based on single frame facial registration framework. The system is flexible because it does not require any strong 3D facial priors such as blendshape models. We demonstrate the power of our approach by capturing a wide range of 3D facial expressions using a single RGBD camera and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy by comparing against alternative methods.</p><p>4 0.12385441 <a title="185-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Automatic_Registration_of_RGB-D_Scans_via_Salient_Directions.html">56 iccv-2013-Automatic Registration of RGB-D Scans via Salient Directions</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernhard Zeisl, Kevin Köser, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of wide-baseline registration of RGB-D data, such as photo-textured laser scans without any artificial targets or prediction on the relative motion. Our approach allows to fully automatically register scans taken in GPS-denied environments such as urban canyon, industrial facilities or even indoors. We build upon image features which are plenty, localized well and much more discriminative than geometry features; however, they suffer from viewpoint distortions and request for normalization. We utilize the principle of salient directions present in the geometry and propose to extract (several) directions from the distribution of surface normals or other cues such as observable symmetries. Compared to previous work we pose no requirements on the scanned scene (like containing large textured planes) and can handle arbitrary surface shapes. Rendering the whole scene from these repeatable directions using an orthographic camera generates textures which are identical up to 2D similarity transformations. This ambiguity is naturally handled by 2D features and allows to find stable correspondences among scans. For geometric pose estimation from tentative matches we propose a fast and robust 2 point sample consensus scheme integrating an early rejection phase. We evaluate our approach on different challenging real world scenes.</p><p>5 0.10082977 <a title="185-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Kneip, Simon Lynen</p><p>Abstract: This work makes use of a novel, recently proposed epipolar constraint for computing the relative pose between two calibrated images. By enforcing the coplanarity of epipolar plane normal vectors, it constrains the three degrees of freedom of the relative rotation between two camera views directly—independently of the translation. The present paper shows how the approach can be extended to n points, and translated into an efficient eigenvalue minimization over the three rotational degrees of freedom. Each iteration in the non-linear optimization has constant execution time, independently of the number of features. Two global optimization approaches are proposed. The first one consists of an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt scheme with randomized initial value, which already leads to stable and accurate results. The second scheme consists of a globally optimal branch-and-bound algorithm based on a bound on the eigenvalue variation derived from symmetric eigenvalue-perturbation theory. Analysis of the cost function reveals insights into the nature of a specific relative pose problem, and outlines the complexity under different conditions. The algorithm shows state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. essential-matrix based solutions, and a frameto-frame application to a video sequence immediately leads to an alternative, real-time visual odometry solution. Note: All algorithms in this paper are made available in the OpenGV library.

<p>Author: Jiaolong Yang, Hongdong Li, Yunde Jia</p><p>Abstract: Registration is a fundamental task in computer vision. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is one of the widely-used methods for solving the registration problem. Based on local iteration, ICP is however well-known to suffer from local minima. Its performance critically relies on the quality of initialization, and only local optimality is guaranteed. This paper provides the very first globally optimal solution to Euclidean registration of two 3D pointsets or two 3D surfaces under the L2 error. Our method is built upon ICP, but combines it with a branch-and-bound (BnB) scheme which searches the 3D motion space SE(3) efficiently. By exploiting the special structure of the underlying geometry, we derive novel upper and lower bounds for the ICP error function. The integration of local ICP and global BnB enables the new method to run efficiently in practice, and its optimality is exactly guaranteed.

<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Xianfeng Gu, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dense non-rigid 3D surface registration, which brings together Riemannian geometry and graphical models. To this end, we first introduce a generic deformation model, called Canonical Distortion Coefficients (CDCs), by characterizing the deformation of every point on a surface using the distortions along its two principle directions. This model subsumes the deformation groups commonly used in surface registration such as isometry and conformality, and is able to handle more complex deformations. We also derive its discrete counterpart which can be computed very efficiently in a closed form. Based on these, we introduce a higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) model which seamlessly integrates our deformation model and a geometry/texture similarity metric. Then we jointly establish the optimal correspondences for all the points via maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Moreover, we develop a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently perform the inference for the proposed higher-order MRF model. The resulting registration algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both dense non-rigid 3D surface registration and tracking.</p><p>3 0.65915787 <a title="185-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Geometric_Registration_Based_on_Distortion_Estimation.html">183 iccv-2013-Geometric Registration Based on Distortion Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Zeng, Mayank Goswami, Feng Luo, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Surface registration plays a fundamental role in many applications in computer vision and aims at finding a oneto-one correspondence between surfaces. Conformal mapping based surface registration methods conformally map 2D/3D surfaces onto 2D canonical domains and perform the matching on the 2D plane. This registration framework reduces dimensionality, and the result is intrinsic to Riemannian metric and invariant under isometric deformation. However, conformal mapping will be affected by inconsistent boundaries and non-isometric deformations of surfaces. In this work, we quantify the effects of boundary variation and non-isometric deformation to conformal mappings, and give the theoretical upper bounds for the distortions of conformal mappings under these two factors. Besides giving the thorough theoretical proofs of the theorems, we verified them by concrete experiments using 3D human facial scans with dynamic expressions and varying boundaries. Furthermore, we used the distortion estimates for reducing search range in feature matching of surface registration applications. The experimental results are consistent with the theoreticalpredictions and also demonstrate the performance improvements in feature tracking.</p><p>4 0.63669634 <a title="185-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven_Efficiently-Sampled_Sparse_Graphical_Models_for_Concurrent_Tumor_Segmentation_and_Atlas_Registration.html">432 iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven Efficiently-Sampled Sparse Graphical Models for Concurrent Tumor Segmentation and Atlas Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Sarah Parisot, William Wells_III, Stéphane Chemouny, Hugues Duffau, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based methods have become popular in recent years and have successfully addressed tasks like segmentation and deformable registration. Their main strength is optimality of the obtained solution while their main limitation is the lack of precision due to the grid-like representations and the discrete nature of the quantized search space. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for combined segmentation/registration of brain tumors that adapts graph and sampling resolution according to the image content. To this end we estimate the segmentation and registration marginals towards adaptive graph resolution and intelligent definition of the search space. This information is considered in a hierarchical framework where uncertainties are propagated in a natural manner. State of the art results in the joint segmentation/registration of brain images with low-grade gliomas demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>5 0.61631989 <a title="185-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Multiple_Non-rigid_Surface_Detection_and_Registration.html">283 iccv-2013-Multiple Non-rigid Surface Detection and Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Wu, Yoshihisa Ijiri, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Detecting and registering nonrigid surfaces are two important research problems for computer vision. Much work has been done with the assumption that there exists only one instance in the image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that detects and registers multiple nonrigid instances of given objects in a cluttered image. Specifically, after we use low level feature points to obtain the initial matches between templates and the input image, a novel high-order affinity graph is constructed to model the consistency of local topology. A hierarchical clustering approach is then used to locate the nonrigid surfaces. To remove the outliers in the cluster, we propose a deterministic annealing approach based on the Thin Plate Spline (TPS) model. The proposed method achieves high accuracy even when the number of outliers is nineteen times larger than the inliers. As the matches may appear sparsely in each instance, we propose a TPS based match growing approach to propagate the matches. Finally, an approach that fuses feature and appearance information is proposed to register each nonrigid surface. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves promis- ing results in detecting and registering multiple non-rigid surfaces in a cluttered scene.</p><p>6 0.59323663 <a title="185-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Automatic_Registration_of_RGB-D_Scans_via_Salient_Directions.html">56 iccv-2013-Automatic Registration of RGB-D Scans via Salient Directions</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiaming Guo, Zhuwen Li, Loong-Fah Cheong, Steven Zhiying Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Given a pair of videos having a common action, our goal is to simultaneously segment this pair of videos to extract this common action. As a preprocessing step, we first remove background trajectories by a motion-based figureground segmentation. To remove the remaining background and those extraneous actions, we propose the trajectory cosaliency measure, which captures the notion that trajectories recurring in all the videos should have their mutual saliency boosted. This requires a trajectory matching process which can compare trajectories with different lengths and not necessarily spatiotemporally aligned, and yet be discriminative enough despite significant intra-class variation in the common action. We further leverage the graph matching to enforce geometric coherence between regions so as to reduce feature ambiguity and matching errors. Finally, to classify the trajectories into common action and action outliers, we formulate the problem as a binary labeling of a Markov Random Field, in which the data term is measured by the trajectory co-saliency and the smooth- ness term is measured by the spatiotemporal consistency between trajectories. To evaluate the performance of our framework, we introduce a dataset containing clips that have animal actions as well as human actions. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well in common action extraction.</p><p>3 0.76069856 <a title="185-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Coherent_Object_Detection_with_3D_Geometric_Context_from_a_Single_Image.html">79 iccv-2013-Coherent Object Detection with 3D Geometric Context from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiyan Pan, Takeo Kanade</p><p>Abstract: Objects in a real world image cannot have arbitrary appearance, sizes and locations due to geometric constraints in 3D space. Such a 3D geometric context plays an important role in resolving visual ambiguities and achieving coherent object detection. In this paper, we develop a RANSAC-CRF framework to detect objects that are geometrically coherent in the 3D world. Different from existing methods, we propose a novel generalized RANSAC algorithm to generate global 3D geometry hypothesesfrom local entities such that outlier suppression and noise reduction is achieved simultaneously. In addition, we evaluate those hypotheses using a CRF which considers both the compatibility of individual objects under global 3D geometric context and the compatibility between adjacent objects under local 3D geometric context. Experiment results show that our approach compares favorably with the state of the art.</p><p>4 0.75950485 <a title="185-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Rank_Minimization_across_Appearance_and_Shape_for_AAM_Ensemble_Fitting.html">339 iccv-2013-Rank Minimization across Appearance and Shape for AAM Ensemble Fitting</a></p>
<p>Author: Xin Cheng, Sridha Sridharan, Jason Saragih, Simon Lucey</p><p>Abstract: Active Appearance Models (AAMs) employ a paradigm of inverting a synthesis model of how an object can vary in terms of shape and appearance. As a result, the ability of AAMs to register an unseen object image is intrinsically linked to two factors. First, how well the synthesis model can reconstruct the object image. Second, the degrees of freedom in the model. Fewer degrees of freedom yield a higher likelihood of good fitting performance. In this paper we look at how these seemingly contrasting factors can complement one another for the problem of AAM fitting of an ensemble of images stemming from a constrained set (e.g. an ensemble of face images of the same person).</p><p>5 0.75863361 <a title="185-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Optical_Flow_via_Locally_Adaptive_Fusion_of_Complementary_Data_Costs.html">300 iccv-2013-Optical Flow via Locally Adaptive Fusion of Complementary Data Costs</a></p>
<p>Author: Tae Hyun Kim, Hee Seok Lee, Kyoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: Many state-of-the-art optical flow estimation algorithms optimize the data and regularization terms to solve ill-posed problems. In this paper, in contrast to the conventional optical flow framework that uses a single or fixed data model, we study a novel framework that employs locally varying data term that adaptively combines different multiple types of data models. The locally adaptive data term greatly reduces the matching ambiguity due to the complementary nature of the multiple data models. The optimal number of complementary data models is learnt by minimizing the redundancy among them under the minimum description length constraint (MDL). From these chosen data models, a new optical flow estimation energy model is designed with the weighted sum of the multiple data models, and a convex optimization-based highly effective and practical solution thatfinds the opticalflow, as well as the weights isproposed. Comparative experimental results on the Middlebury optical flow benchmark show that the proposed method using the complementary data models outperforms the state-ofthe art methods.</p><p>6 0.75860405 <a title="185-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Group_Norm_for_Learning_Structured_SVMs_with_Unstructured_Latent_Variables.html">187 iccv-2013-Group Norm for Learning Structured SVMs with Unstructured Latent Variables</a></p>

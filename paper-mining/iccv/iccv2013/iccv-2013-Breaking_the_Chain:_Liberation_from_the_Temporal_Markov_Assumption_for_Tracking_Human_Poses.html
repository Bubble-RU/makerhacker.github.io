<p>Author: Susanna Ricco, Carlo Tomasi</p><p>Abstract: Dense motion of image points over many video frames can provide important information about the world. However, occlusions and drift make it impossible to compute long motionpaths by merely concatenating opticalflow vectors between consecutive frames. Instead, we solve for entire paths directly, and flag the frames in which each is visible. As in previous work, we anchor each path to a unique pixel which guarantees an even spatial distribution of paths. Unlike earlier methods, we allow paths to be anchored in any frame. By explicitly requiring that at least one visible path passes within a small neighborhood of every pixel, we guarantee complete coverage of all visible points in all frames. We achieve state-of-the-art results on real sequences including both rigid and non-rigid motions with significant occlusions.</p><p>3 0.26810819 <a title="65-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Find_the_Best_Path%3A_An_Efficient_and_Accurate_Classifier_for_Image_Hierarchies.html">165 iccv-2013-Find the Best Path: An Efficient and Accurate Classifier for Image Hierarchies</a></p>
<p>Author: Min Sun, Wan Huang, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: Many methods have been proposed to solve the image classification problem for a large number of categories. Among them, methods based on tree-based representations achieve good trade-off between accuracy and test time efficiency. While focusing on learning a tree-shaped hierarchy and the corresponding set of classifiers, most of them [11, 2, 14] use a greedy prediction algorithm for test time efficiency. We argue that the dramatic decrease in accuracy at high efficiency is caused by the specific design choice of the learning and greedy prediction algorithms. In this work, we propose a classifier which achieves a better trade-off between efficiency and accuracy with a given tree-shaped hierarchy. First, we convert the classification problem as finding the best path in the hierarchy, and a novel branchand-bound-like algorithm is introduced to efficiently search for the best path. Second, we jointly train the classifiers using a novel Structured SVM (SSVM) formulation with additional bound constraints. As a result, our method achieves a significant 4.65%, 5.43%, and 4.07% (relative 24.82%, 41.64%, and 109.79%) improvement in accuracy at high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art greedy “tree-based” methods [14] on Caltech-256 [15], SUN [32] and ImageNet 1K [9] dataset, respectively. Finally, we show that our branch-and-bound-like algorithm naturally ranks the paths in the hierarchy (Fig. 8) so that users can further process them.</p><p>4 0.19465274 <a title="65-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Tree_Shape_Priors_with_Connectivity_Constraints_Using_Convex_Relaxation_on_General_Graphs.html">429 iccv-2013-Tree Shape Priors with Connectivity Constraints Using Convex Relaxation on General Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan Stühmer, Peter Schröder, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to include a connectivity prior into image segmentation that is based on a binary labeling of a directed graph, in this case a geodesic shortest path tree. Specifically we make two contributions: First, we construct a geodesic shortest path tree with a distance measure that is related to the image data and the bending energy of each path in the tree. Second, we include a connectivity prior in our segmentation model, that allows to segment not only a single elongated structure, but instead a whole connected branching tree. Because both our segmentation model and the connectivity constraint are convex, a global optimal solution can be found. To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure. To validate our method we present results on data from medical imaging in angiography and retinal blood vessel segmentation.</p><p>5 0.18461539 <a title="65-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Face_Recognition_Using_Face_Patch_Networks.html">153 iccv-2013-Face Recognition Using Face Patch Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Chaochao Lu, Deli Zhao, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: When face images are taken in the wild, the large variations in facial pose, illumination, and expression make face recognition challenging. The most fundamental problem for face recognition is to measure the similarity between faces. The traditional measurements such as various mathematical norms, Hausdorff distance, and approximate geodesic distance cannot accurately capture the structural information between faces in such complex circumstances. To address this issue, we develop a novel face patch network, based on which we define a new similarity measure called the random path (RP) measure. The RP measure is derivedfrom the collective similarity ofpaths by performing random walks in the network. It can globally characterize the contextual and curved structures of the face space. To apply the RP measure, we construct two kinds of networks: . cuhk . edu . hk the in-face network and the out-face network. The in-face network is drawn from any two face images and captures the local structural information. The out-face network is constructed from all the training face patches, thereby modeling the global structures of face space. The two face networks are structurally complementary and can be combined together to improve the recognition performance. Experiments on the Multi-PIE and LFW benchmarks show that the RP measure outperforms most of the state-of-art algorithms for face recognition.</p><p>6 0.18362278 <a title="65-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Data_Association%3A_Bayesian_Model_Selection_for_Multi-target_Tracking.html">230 iccv-2013-Latent Data Association: Bayesian Model Selection for Multi-target Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Petter Strandmark, Johannes Ulén, Fredrik Kahl, Leo Grady</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a method of finding thin, elongated structures in images and volumes. We use shortest paths to minimize very general functionals of higher-order curve properties, such as curvature and torsion. Our globally optimal method uses line graphs and its runtime is polynomial in the size of the discretization, often in the order of seconds on a single computer. To our knowledge, we are the first to perform experiments in three dimensions with curvature and torsion regularization. The largest graphs we process have almost one hundred billion arcs. Experiments on medical images and in multi-view reconstruction show the significance and practical usefulness of regularization based on curvature while torsion is still only tractable for small-scale problems.</p><p>5 0.56562924 <a title="65-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Parallel_Transport_of_Deformations_in_Shape_Space_of_Elastic_Surfaces.html">307 iccv-2013-Parallel Transport of Deformations in Shape Space of Elastic Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Qian Xie, Sebastian Kurtek, Huiling Le, Anuj Srivastava</p><p>Abstract: Statistical shape analysis develops methods for comparisons, deformations, summarizations, and modeling of shapes in given data sets. These tasks require afundamental tool called parallel transport of tangent vectors along arbitrary paths. This tool is essential for: (1) computation of geodesic paths using either shooting or path-straightening method, (2) transferring deformations across objects, and (3) modeling of statistical variability in shapes. Using the square-root normal field (SRNF) representation of parameterized surfaces, we present a method for transporting deformations along paths in the shape space. This is difficult despite the underlying space being a vector space because the chosen (elastic) Riemannian metric is non-standard. Using a finite-basis for representing SRNFs of shapes, we derive expressions for Christoffel symbols that enable parallel transports. We demonstrate this framework using examples from shape analysis of parameterized spherical sur- faces, in the three contexts mentioned above.</p><p>6 0.54160559 <a title="65-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Tree_Shape_Priors_with_Connectivity_Constraints_Using_Convex_Relaxation_on_General_Graphs.html">429 iccv-2013-Tree Shape Priors with Connectivity Constraints Using Convex Relaxation on General Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryan Tokola, Wongun Choi, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to multi-target tracking that has expressive potential beyond the capabilities of chainshaped hidden Markov models, yet has significantly reduced complexity. Our framework, which we call tracking-byselection, is similar to tracking-by-detection in that it separates the tasks of detection and tracking, but it shifts tempo-labs . com Stanford, CA ssi lvio @ st an ford . edu ral reasoning from the tracking stage to the detection stage. The core feature of tracking-by-selection is that it reasons about path hypotheses that traverse the entire video instead of a chain of single-frame object hypotheses. A traditional chain-shaped tracking-by-detection model is only able to promote consistency between one frame and the next. In tracking-by-selection, path hypotheses exist across time, and encouraging long-term temporal consistency is as simple as rewarding path hypotheses with consistent image features. One additional advantage of tracking-by-selection is that it results in a dramatically simplified model that can be solved exactly. We adapt an existing tracking-by-detection model to the tracking-by-selectionframework, and show improvedperformance on a challenging dataset (introduced in [18]).</p><p>2 0.89247894 <a title="65-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Optimization_Problems_for_Fast_AAM_Fitting_in-the-Wild.html">302 iccv-2013-Optimization Problems for Fast AAM Fitting in-the-Wild</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgios Tzimiropoulos, Maja Pantic</p><p>Abstract: We describe a very simple framework for deriving the most-well known optimization problems in Active Appearance Models (AAMs), and most importantly for providing efficient solutions. Our formulation results in two optimization problems for fast and exact AAM fitting, and one new algorithm which has the important advantage of being applicable to 3D. We show that the dominant cost for both forward and inverse algorithms is a few times mN which is the cost of projecting an image onto the appearance subspace. This makes both algorithms not only computationally realizable but also very attractive speed-wise for most current systems. Because exact AAM fitting is no longer computationally prohibitive, we trained AAMs in-the-wild with the goal of investigating whether AAMs benefit from such a training process. Our results show that although we did not use sophisticated shape priors, robust features or robust norms for improving performance, AAMs perform notably well and in some cases comparably with current state-ofthe-art methods.

<p>Author: Susanna Ricco, Carlo Tomasi</p><p>Abstract: Dense motion of image points over many video frames can provide important information about the world. However, occlusions and drift make it impossible to compute long motionpaths by merely concatenating opticalflow vectors between consecutive frames. Instead, we solve for entire paths directly, and flag the frames in which each is visible. As in previous work, we anchor each path to a unique pixel which guarantees an even spatial distribution of paths. Unlike earlier methods, we allow paths to be anchored in any frame. By explicitly requiring that at least one visible path passes within a small neighborhood of every pixel, we guarantee complete coverage of all visible points in all frames. We achieve state-of-the-art results on real sequences including both rigid and non-rigid motions with significant occlusions.</p><p>4 0.88702333 <a title="65-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Event_Detection_in_Complex_Scenes_Using_Interval_Temporal_Constraints.html">146 iccv-2013-Event Detection in Complex Scenes Using Interval Temporal Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yifan Zhang, Qiang Ji, Hanqing Lu</p><p>Abstract: In complex scenes with multiple atomic events happening sequentially or in parallel, detecting each individual event separately may not always obtain robust and reliable result. It is essential to detect them in a holistic way which incorporates the causality and temporal dependency among them to compensate the limitation of current computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose an interval temporal constrained dynamic Bayesian network to extendAllen ’s interval algebra network (IAN) [2]from a deterministic static model to a probabilistic dynamic system, which can not only capture the complex interval temporal relationships, but also model the evolution dynamics and handle the uncertainty from the noisy visual observation. In the model, the topology of the IAN on each time slice and the interlinks between the time slices are discovered by an advanced structure learning method. The duration of the event and the unsynchronized time lags between two correlated event intervals are captured by a duration model, so that we can better determine the temporal boundary of the event. Empirical results on two real world datasets show the power of the proposed interval temporal constrained model.</p><p>5 0.8748858 <a title="65-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Tree_Shape_Priors_with_Connectivity_Constraints_Using_Convex_Relaxation_on_General_Graphs.html">429 iccv-2013-Tree Shape Priors with Connectivity Constraints Using Convex Relaxation on General Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan Stühmer, Peter Schröder, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to include a connectivity prior into image segmentation that is based on a binary labeling of a directed graph, in this case a geodesic shortest path tree. Specifically we make two contributions: First, we construct a geodesic shortest path tree with a distance measure that is related to the image data and the bending energy of each path in the tree. Second, we include a connectivity prior in our segmentation model, that allows to segment not only a single elongated structure, but instead a whole connected branching tree. Because both our segmentation model and the connectivity constraint are convex, a global optimal solution can be found. To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure. To validate our method we present results on data from medical imaging in angiography and retinal blood vessel segmentation.</p><p>6 0.87467319 <a title="65-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Estimating_Human_Pose_with_Flowing_Puppets.html">143 iccv-2013-Estimating Human Pose with Flowing Puppets</a></p>

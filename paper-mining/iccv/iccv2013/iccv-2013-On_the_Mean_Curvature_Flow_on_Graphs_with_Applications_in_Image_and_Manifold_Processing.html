</p><p>4 Introduction The mean curvature flow level set equation and its generalization have numerous applications in boundary problem in material sciences, computational fluid dynamics, image processing, computer vision and many other fields, see [1, 7] and references therein. [sent-11, score-0.894]
</p><p>5 Many papers have been devoted to numerical algorithms for mean curvature flow. [sent-12, score-0.675]
</p><p>6 Recently, there has been a growing interest in the mathematical study of the motion of nonlocal or fractional curvature on Euclidean domains [11, 12]. [sent-14, score-0.931]
</p><p>7 The main goal ofthis paper is to propose an adaptation of mean curvature flow level set equation on weighted graphs, using the framework of Partial difference Equations (PdEs) [8]. [sent-15, score-1.047]
</p><p>8 Our first motivation is to extend the notion of mean curvature to discrete settings and to show the relation between this mean curvature and local and nonlocal forms of curvature in Euclidean domains. [sent-16, score-2.355]
</p><p>9 The second motivation concerns extending applications of such equation to any discrete data that can be represented by a graph to solve many problems in image and manifold processing. [sent-17, score-0.369]
</p><p>10 Indeed, many contemporary applications have to deal with large data sets of different types and collected in the form of graphs and networks such as images, videos, meshes, point clouds and images on 3D surfaces. [sent-18, score-0.208]
</p><p>11 In such situations, any processing and analysis of these data depends on the ability to perform signal or data processing on graphs and networks. [sent-19, score-0.205]
</p><p>12 Similarly, there are many interesting works that aim to mimic and to transpose Partial  ×  Differential Equations (PDEs) and variational methods on graphs with applications in image and manifold processing or in machine learning. [sent-22, score-0.205]
</p><p>13 Short background on PDE level set mean curvature The level set formulation of the mean curvature flow problem was suggested by Osher and Sethian in [1]. [sent-24, score-1.483]
</p><p>14 It arises from the front propagation equation and its implementation on the PDEs level set. [sent-25, score-0.221]
</p><p>15 Of course, the specific nature =of {thf(eu le,tv)el = =se 0t equation depends on ,t thhee fo sprmeof the normal velocity function F. [sent-35, score-0.197]
</p><p>16 When the normal velocity F also depends on the spatial derivative of the normal vector, we obtain the mean curvature equation:  ft(u,t) = ∇. [sent-40, score-0.771]
</p><p>17 The level set equation ius accompanied by an ifni gtiraald cioenntd. [sent-45, score-0.174]
</p><p>18 We propose to define the notion of discrete weighted perimeters using a family of discrete gradients on graphs. [sent-51, score-0.547]
</p><p>19 As in the continuous settings, we introduce the notion of nonlocal curvature as the first variation of the discrete perimeters. [sent-52, score-1.065]
</p><p>20 We show that our formulation unifies both local and nonlocal notions of the curvature. [sent-53, score-0.344]
</p><p>21 The transcription of the level set equation on graphs by replacing curvature and gradient leads to a Partial differ-  × ×  ence Equation. [sent-55, score-0.977]
</p><p>22 Our proposed numerical scheme leads to a morphological approach alternating dilation and erosion processes. [sent-56, score-0.296]
</p><p>23 Section 2 presents a general definition of Partial difference Equations on weighted graph. [sent-59, score-0.249]
</p><p>24 We begin briefly by reviewing some basic definitions and operators on weighted graphs. [sent-68, score-0.213]
</p><p>25 Let us consider the general situation where any discrete domain can be viewed as a weighted graph. [sent-70, score-0.172]
</p><p>26 A weighted graph G = (V, E, w) consists in a finite set V of N vertices and in a finite set E ⊆ V V of edges. [sent-71, score-0.314]
</p><p>27 u Lnedtir (euc,tevd) graph is weighted if it is associated with a weight function w : V V → [0, 1] . [sent-74, score-0.243]
</p><p>28 Difference, Divergence and Discrete Gradients on Graphs Let us fix a weighted graph G = (V, E, w). [sent-121, score-0.216]
</p><p>29 The weighted directional external and internal difference operators are respectively:  ( ∂∂v−+vf ) ( u ) == γ ( u , v ) ( f ( v ) −− f ( u ) ) −+,and 669988  with (x)+ = max(0, x) and (x)−= −min(0, x). [sent-135, score-0.299]

</p><p>31 (3)  Two discrete formulations of weighted morphological gradients on graphs are defined. [sent-137, score-0.441]
</p><p>32 The weighted external ∇w+ agnradd tiehen tisnt oenrn garal ∇w− gradient operators are respectively:  (∇+wf)(u) = ? [sent-138, score-0.213]
</p><p>33 (8)  Moreover, with a constant weight function and p = ∞, equation v(8er), recovers nthstea nuts wuaeli expression aonf algebraic morphological external and internal gradients. [sent-166, score-0.324]
</p><p>34 These gradients are used in [2] to adapt the well-known Eikonal equation on discrete domains defined as:  ∂∂ft(u,t) = μ(u)? [sent-167, score-0.243]
</p><p>35 (10) This equation summarizes the dilation and erosion processes. [sent-174, score-0.334]
</p><p>36 When μ > 0, then the external gradient is used and this equation corresponds to a dilation. [sent-175, score-0.18]
</p><p>37 Mean Curvature on Graph In this section, we present our new definition of mean curvature on graph by introducing nonlocal perimeters on graph. [sent-178, score-1.329]
</p><p>38 We define the mean curvature as the first variation of these perimeters. [sent-179, score-0.702]
</p><p>39 We will show that the transcription of the mean curvature equation (1) using our definition and the morphological gradients leads to a difference equation solved by a simple and iterative digital algorithm involving  morphological erosion and dilatation on graph. [sent-180, score-1.41]

</p><p>42 Based on the previous definitions, let us define a family of perimeters on graph. [sent-221, score-0.229]
</p><p>43 As in the continuous case where the perimeter is linked to the total variation via co-area formula, we will show that our proposed perimeters cover this property. [sent-264, score-0.314]
</p><p>44 (24)  As in the continuous domain, we will define the mean curvature as the first variation of the perimeters that we just defined. [sent-288, score-0.939]
</p><p>45 ∈ ∂+A, the mean curvature of u0 is defined as:  K+w(u0,A) =Per+w,1(A ∪ {μu(0u}0)) − Perw+,1(A), where μ(u0) define the degree of a vertex u0. [sent-291, score-0.809]
</p><p>46 And for ∂−A, the mean curvature of u0 is defined as:  K−w(u0,A) =Per−w,1(A) −μ P(eur0w−),1(A − {u0}). [sent-292, score-0.675]
</p><p>47 Similarly, the mean curvature Kw− of  u0  u0 ∈  (29)  is rewritten as:  Kw−(u0,A) =? [sent-310, score-0.711]
</p><p>48 Then, for  (28)  (30)  ∂A, the mean curvature is defined as:  Kw(u0,A) =? [sent-313, score-0.675]
</p><p>49 (31)  Based on this definitions, we can extend the notion of curvature to any function f defined on a graph. [sent-316, score-0.64]

</p><p>51 Connection with Nonlocal Mean Curvature and Euclidean Graph We will show that our definition of mean curvature is linked to the notion of fractional mean curvature introduced in [11]. [sent-325, score-1.516]
</p><p>52 The notion of the fractional perimeter (s-perimeter) and the corresponding minimization problem were introduced in [12]. [sent-326, score-0.175]
</p><p>53 (36)  The above equation can be interpreted as a continuous version of our proposed definition. [sent-336, score-0.187]
</p><p>54 0|x−1oy|tnh+esrwiwsei,th 0 < s < 1 our mean curvature is defined as:  Kw(x,A) =? [sent-340, score-0.675]
</p><p>55 (37)  One can see that the above equation corresponds to the continuous version of equation (36). [sent-343, score-0.293]
</p><p>56 Numerical Scheme Based on the definition of our mean curvature and the transcription of equation (1), our formulation can be expressed for the case of L∞ norm as follow:  ? [sent-346, score-0.92]
</p><p>57 Now, let us show that this iterative equation corresponds  to alternate dilation and erosion (type filter) processes depending on the sign of Kw. [sent-353, score-0.359]
</p><p>58 We introduce two operators, npeonnldoicngal odnila tthieon s g(NnL oDf) K and nonlocal erosion (NLE) that are defined respectively as: NLD(f(u)) = f(u) + ? [sent-354, score-0.403]
</p><p>59 The time variable is discretized using the explicit Euler method as:  ∂∂ft(u) =fn+1(uΔ) −t fn(u),  (41)  770011  where fn (u) = f(u, nΔt) and equation (38) can be rewritten as the following iterative equation:  fn+1(u)  = fn(u)  ? [sent-360, score-0.305]
</p><p>60 (42) To solve this dilation and erosion processes, in contrast to the PDEs case, no spatial discretization is needed thanks to derivatives directly expressed in a discrete form. [sent-367, score-0.287]

</p><p>62 (43)  In the case where 1− ΔtKw+ = 0, equation (43) can be interpreted as an iteererat 1iv −e nΔotnKlocal dilation (NLD) process. [sent-369, score-0.237]

<p>Author: Carl Olsson, Johannes Ulén, Yuri Boykov, Vladimir Kolmogorov</p><p>Abstract: Energies with high-order non-submodular interactions have been shown to be very useful in vision due to their high modeling power. Optimization of such energies, however, is generally NP-hard. A naive approach that works for small problem instances is exhaustive search, that is, enumeration of all possible labelings of the underlying graph. We propose a general minimization approach for large graphs based on enumeration of labelings of certain small patches. This partial enumeration technique reduces complex highorder energy formulations to pairwise Constraint Satisfaction Problems with unary costs (uCSP), which can be efficiently solved using standard methods like TRW-S. Our approach outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art algorithms on well known difficult problems (e.g. curvature regularization, stereo, deconvolution); it gives near global minimum and better speed. Our main application of interest is curvature regularization. In the context of segmentation, our partial enumeration technique allows to evaluate curvature directly on small patches using a novel integral geometry approach. 1</p><p>3 0.37967208 <a title="296-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Shortest_Paths_with_Curvature_and_Torsion.html">389 iccv-2013-Shortest Paths with Curvature and Torsion</a></p>

<p>Author: Kwang In Kim, James Tompkin, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: One fundamental assumption in object recognition as well as in other computer vision and pattern recognition problems is that the data generation process lies on a manifold and that it respects the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. This assumption is held in several successful algorithms for diffusion and regularization, in particular, in graph-Laplacian-based algorithms. We claim that the performance of existing algorithms can be improved if we additionally account for how the manifold is embedded within the ambient space, i.e., if we consider the extrinsic geometry of the manifold. We present a procedure for characterizing the extrinsic (as well as intrinsic) curvature of a manifold M which is described by a sampled point cloud in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Once estimated, we use this characterization in general diffusion and regularization on M, and form a new regularizer on a point cloud. The resulting re-weighted graph Laplacian demonstrates superior performance over classical graph Laplacian in semisupervised learning and spectral clustering.</p><p>5 0.11262155 <a title="296-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Motion-Aware_KNN_Laplacian_for_Video_Matting.html">275 iccv-2013-Motion-Aware KNN Laplacian for Video Matting</a></p>
<p>Author: Dingzeyu Li, Qifeng Chen, Chi-Keung Tang</p><p>Abstract: This paper demonstrates how the nonlocal principle benefits video matting via the KNN Laplacian, which comes with a straightforward implementation using motionaware K nearest neighbors. In hindsight, the fundamental problem to solve in video matting is to produce spatiotemporally coherent clusters of moving foreground pixels. When used as described, the motion-aware KNN Laplacian is effective in addressing this fundamental problem, as demonstrated by sparse user markups typically on only one frame in a variety of challenging examples featuring ambiguous foreground and background colors, changing topologies with disocclusion, significant illumination changes, fast motion, and motion blur. When working with existing Laplacian-based systems, our Laplacian is expected to benefit them immediately with improved clustering of moving foreground pixels.</p><p>6 0.11245038 <a title="296-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Graphs_to_Match.html">238 iccv-2013-Learning Graphs to Match</a></p>

<p>Author: Carl Olsson, Johannes Ulén, Yuri Boykov, Vladimir Kolmogorov</p><p>Abstract: Energies with high-order non-submodular interactions have been shown to be very useful in vision due to their high modeling power. Optimization of such energies, however, is generally NP-hard. A naive approach that works for small problem instances is exhaustive search, that is, enumeration of all possible labelings of the underlying graph. We propose a general minimization approach for large graphs based on enumeration of labelings of certain small patches. This partial enumeration technique reduces complex highorder energy formulations to pairwise Constraint Satisfaction Problems with unary costs (uCSP), which can be efficiently solved using standard methods like TRW-S. Our approach outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art algorithms on well known difficult problems (e.g. curvature regularization, stereo, deconvolution); it gives near global minimum and better speed. Our main application of interest is curvature regularization. In the context of segmentation, our partial enumeration technique allows to evaluate curvature directly on small patches using a novel integral geometry approach. 1</p><p>4 0.76325071 <a title="296-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Curvature-Aware_Regularization_on_Riemannian_Submanifolds.html">100 iccv-2013-Curvature-Aware Regularization on Riemannian Submanifolds</a></p>

<p>Author: Jan Stühmer, Peter Schröder, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to include a connectivity prior into image segmentation that is based on a binary labeling of a directed graph, in this case a geodesic shortest path tree. Specifically we make two contributions: First, we construct a geodesic shortest path tree with a distance measure that is related to the image data and the bending energy of each path in the tree. Second, we include a connectivity prior in our segmentation model, that allows to segment not only a single elongated structure, but instead a whole connected branching tree. Because both our segmentation model and the connectivity constraint are convex, a global optimal solution can be found. To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure. To validate our method we present results on data from medical imaging in angiography and retinal blood vessel segmentation.</p><p>6 0.31980073 <a title="296-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Potts_Model%2C_Parametric_Maxflow_and_K-Submodular_Functions.html">324 iccv-2013-Potts Model, Parametric Maxflow and K-Submodular Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Tom Sie Ho Lee, Sanja Fidler, Sven Dickinson</p><p>Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful shape regularity that’s been exploited by perceptual grouping researchers in both human and computer vision to recover part structure from an image without a priori knowledge of scene content. Drawing on the concept of a medial axis, defined as the locus of centers of maximal inscribed discs that sweep out a symmetric part, we model part recovery as the search for a sequence of deformable maximal inscribed disc hypotheses generated from a multiscale superpixel segmentation, a framework proposed by [13]. However, we learn affinities between adjacent superpixels in a space that’s invariant to bending and tapering along the symmetry axis, enabling us to capture a wider class of symmetric parts. Moreover, we introduce a global cost that perceptually integrates the hypothesis space by combining a pairwise and a higher-level smoothing term, which we minimize globally using dynamic programming. The new framework is demonstrated on two datasets, and is shown to significantly outperform the baseline [13].</p><p>3 0.68265867 <a title="296-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Rotational_Stereo_Model_Based_on_XSlit_Imaging.html">28 iccv-2013-A Rotational Stereo Model Based on XSlit Imaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinwei Ye, Yu Ji, Jingyi Yu</p><p>Abstract: Traditional stereo matching assumes perspective viewing cameras under a translational motion: the second camera is translated away from the first one to create parallax. In this paper, we investigate a different, rotational stereo model on a special multi-perspective camera, the XSlit camera [9, 24]. We show that rotational XSlit (R-XSlit) stereo can be effectively created by fixing the sensor and slit locations but switching the two slits’ directions. We first derive the epipolar geometry of R-XSlit in the 4D light field ray space. Our derivation leads to a simple but effective scheme for locating corresponding epipolar “curves ”. To conduct stereo matching, we further derive a new disparity term in our model and develop a patch-based graph-cut solution. To validate our theory, we assemble an XSlit lens by using a pair of cylindrical lenses coupled with slit-shaped apertures. The XSlit lens can be mounted on commodity cameras where the slit directions are adjustable to form desirable R-XSlit pairs. We show through experiments that R-XSlitprovides apotentially advantageous imaging system for conducting fixed-location, dynamic baseline stereo.</p><p>4 0.61783063 <a title="296-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Large-Scale_Multi-resolution_Surface_Reconstruction_from_RGB-D_Sequences.html">228 iccv-2013-Large-Scale Multi-resolution Surface Reconstruction from RGB-D Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Steinbrücker, Christian Kerl, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to generate highly detailed, textured 3D models of large environments from RGB-D sequences. Our system runs in real-time on a standard desktop PC with a state-of-the-art graphics card. To reduce the memory consumption, we fuse the acquired depth maps and colors in a multi-scale octree representation of a signed distance function. To estimate the camera poses, we construct a pose graph and use dense image alignment to determine the relative pose between pairs of frames. We add edges between nodes when we detect loop-closures and optimize the pose graph to correct for long-term drift. Our implementation is highly parallelized on graphics hardware to achieve real-time performance. More specifically, we can reconstruct, store, and continuously update a colored 3D model of an entire corridor of nine rooms at high levels of detail in real-time on a single GPU with 2.5GB.</p><p>5 0.5801065 <a title="296-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Scene_Text_Localization_and_Recognition_with_Oriented_Stroke_Detection.html">376 iccv-2013-Scene Text Localization and Recognition with Oriented Stroke Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Lukáš Neumann, Jiri Matas</p><p>Abstract: An unconstrained end-to-end text localization and recognition method is presented. The method introduces a novel approach for character detection and recognition which combines the advantages of sliding-window and connected component methods. Characters are detected and recognized as image regions which contain strokes of specific orientations in a specific relative position, where the strokes are efficiently detected by convolving the image gradient field with a set of oriented bar filters. Additionally, a novel character representation efficiently calculated from the values obtained in the stroke detection phase is introduced. The representation is robust to shift at the stroke level, which makes it less sensitive to intra-class variations and the noise induced by normalizing character size and positioning. The effectiveness of the representation is demonstrated by the results achieved in the classification of real-world characters using an euclidian nearestneighbor classifier trained on synthetic data in a plain form. The method was evaluated on a standard dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition.</p><p>6 0.576065 <a title="296-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Probabilistic_Elastic_Part_Model_for_Unsupervised_Face_Detector_Adaptation.html">328 iccv-2013-Probabilistic Elastic Part Model for Unsupervised Face Detector Adaptation</a></p>

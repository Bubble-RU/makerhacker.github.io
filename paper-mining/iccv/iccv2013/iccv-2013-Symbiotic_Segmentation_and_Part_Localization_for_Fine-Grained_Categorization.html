<p>Author: Ning Zhang, Ryan Farrell, Forrest Iandola, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing objects in fine-grained domains can be extremely challenging due to the subtle differences between subcategories. Discriminative markings are often highly localized, leading traditional object recognition approaches to struggle with the large pose variation often present in these domains. Pose-normalization seeks to align training exemplars, either piecewise by part or globally for the whole object, effectively factoring out differences in pose and in viewing angle. Prior approaches relied on computationally-expensive filter ensembles for part localization and required extensive supervision. This paper proposes two pose-normalized descriptors based on computationally-efficient deformable part models. The first leverages the semantics inherent in strongly-supervised DPM parts. The second exploits weak semantic annotations to learn cross-component correspondences, computing pose-normalized descriptors from the latent parts of a weakly-supervised DPM. These representations enable pooling across pose and viewpoint, in turn facilitating tasks such as fine-grained recognition and attribute prediction. Experiments conducted on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset and Berkeley Human Attribute dataset demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-art algorithms.</p><p>3 0.28894079 <a title="411-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Fine-Grained_Categorization_by_Alignments.html">169 iccv-2013-Fine-Grained Categorization by Alignments</a></p>
<p>Author: E. Gavves, B. Fernando, C.G.M. Snoek, A.W.M. Smeulders, T. Tuytelaars</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this paper is fine-grained categorization without human interaction. Different from prior work, which relies on detectors for specific object parts, we propose to localize distinctive details by roughly aligning the objects using just the overall shape, since implicit to fine-grained categorization is the existence of a super-class shape shared among all classes. The alignments are then used to transfer part annotations from training images to test images (supervised alignment), or to blindly yet consistently segment the object in a number of regions (unsupervised alignment). We furthermore argue that in the distinction of finegrained sub-categories, classification-oriented encodings like Fisher vectors are better suited for describing localized information than popular matching oriented features like HOG. We evaluate the method on the CU-2011 Birds and Stanford Dogs fine-grained datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art.</p><p>4 0.21389911 <a title="411-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-GrabCut_in_One_Cut.html">186 iccv-2013-GrabCut in One Cut</a></p>
<p>Author: Meng Tang, Lena Gorelick, Olga Veksler, Yuri Boykov</p><p>Abstract: Among image segmentation algorithms there are two major groups: (a) methods assuming known appearance models and (b) methods estimating appearance models jointly with segmentation. Typically, the first group optimizes appearance log-likelihoods in combination with some spacial regularization. This problem is relatively simple and many methods guarantee globally optimal results. The second group treats model parameters as additional variables transforming simple segmentation energies into highorder NP-hard functionals (Zhu-Yuille, Chan-Vese, GrabCut, etc). It is known that such methods indirectly minimize the appearance overlap between the segments. We propose a new energy term explicitly measuring L1 distance between the object and background appearance models that can be globally maximized in one graph cut. We show that in many applications our simple term makes NP-hard segmentation functionals unnecessary. Our one cut algorithm effectively replaces approximate iterative optimization techniques based on block coordinate descent.</p><p>5 0.20135191 <a title="411-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic_Segmentation_without_Annotating_Segments.html">379 iccv-2013-Semantic Segmentation without Annotating Segments</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Xia, Csaba Domokos, Jian Dong, Loong-Fah Cheong, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: Numerous existing object segmentation frameworks commonly utilize the object bounding box as a prior. In this paper, we address semantic segmentation assuming that object bounding boxes are provided by object detectors, but no training data with annotated segments are available. Based on a set of segment hypotheses, we introduce a simple voting scheme to estimate shape guidance for each bounding box. The derived shape guidance is used in the subsequent graph-cut-based figure-ground segmentation. The final segmentation result is obtained by merging the segmentation results in the bounding boxes. We conduct an extensive analysis of the effect of object bounding box accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on both the challenging PASCAL VOC object segmentation dataset and GrabCut50 image segmentation dataset show that the proposed approach achieves competitive results compared to previous detection or bounding box prior based methods, as well as other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods.</p><p>6 0.18805876 <a title="411-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Category-Independent_Object-Level_Saliency_Detection.html">71 iccv-2013-Category-Independent Object-Level Saliency Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Lingxi Xie, Qi Tian, Richang Hong, Shuicheng Yan, Bo Zhang</p><p>Abstract: As a special topic in computer vision, , fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) has been attracting growing attention these years. Different with traditional image classification tasks in which objects have large inter-class variation, the visual concepts in the fine-grained datasets, such as hundreds of bird species, often have very similar semantics. Due to the large inter-class similarity, it is very difficult to classify the objects without locating really discriminative features, therefore it becomes more important for the algorithm to make full use of the part information in order to train a robust model. In this paper, we propose a powerful flowchart named Hierarchical Part Matching (HPM) to cope with finegrained classification tasks. We extend the Bag-of-Features (BoF) model by introducing several novel modules to integrate into image representation, including foreground inference and segmentation, Hierarchical Structure Learn- ing (HSL), and Geometric Phrase Pooling (GPP). We verify in experiments that our algorithm achieves the state-ofthe-art classification accuracy in the Caltech-UCSD-Birds200-2011 dataset by making full use of the ground-truth part annotations.</p><p>5 0.72417599 <a title="411-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic_Segmentation_without_Annotating_Segments.html">379 iccv-2013-Semantic Segmentation without Annotating Segments</a></p>

Subpixel accuracy is achieved by considering several zero-crossings defined by the difference between pairs of unstructured patterns. We use gray-level band-pass white noise patterns that increase robustness to indirect lighting and scene discontinuities. Simulated and experimental results show that our method recovers scene geometry with high subpixel precision, and that it can handle many challenges of active reconstruction systems.

Our approach deals with both sources of error by reconstructing locally smooth scene fragments and letting these fragments deform in order to align to each other. We develop a volumetric registration formulation that leverages the smoothness of the deformation to make optimization practical for large scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially increases the fidelity of complex scene geometry reconstructed with commodity handheld cameras.</p><p>3 0.73667443 <a title="411-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Generalized_Iterated_Shrinkage_Algorithm_for_Non-convex_Sparse_Coding.html">14 iccv-2013-A Generalized Iterated Shrinkage Algorithm for Non-convex Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Wangmeng Zuo, Deyu Meng, Lei Zhang, Xiangchu Feng, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In many sparse coding based image restoration and image classification problems, using non-convex ?p-norm minimization (0 ≤ p < 1) can often obtain better results than timhei convex 0?1 -norm m 1)ini camniza otfiteonn. Ab naiunm bbeetrt of algorithms, e.g., iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), iteratively thresholding method (ITM-?p), and look-up table (LUT), have been proposed for non-convex ?p-norm sparse coding, while some analytic solutions have been suggested for some specific values of p. In this paper, by extending the popular soft-thresholding operator, we propose a generalized iterated shrinkage algorithm (GISA) for ?p-norm non-convex sparse coding. Unlike the analytic solutions, the proposed GISA algorithm is easy to implement, and can be adopted for solving non-convex sparse coding problems with arbitrary p values. Compared with LUT, GISA is more general and does not need to compute and store the look-up tables. Compared with IRLS and ITM-?p, GISA is theoretically more solid and can achieve more accurate solutions. Experiments on image restoration and sparse coding based face recognition are conducted to validate the performance of GISA. ××</p><p>4 0.73645747 <a title="411-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Structured_Model_Selection.html">130 iccv-2013-Dynamic Structured Model Selection</a></p>
<p>Author: David Weiss, Benjamin Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: Ben Taskar University of Washington Seattle, WA t as kar @ c s . washingt on . edu In many cases, the predictive power of structured models for for complex vision tasks is limited by a trade-off between the expressiveness and the computational tractability of the model. However, choosing this trade-off statically a priori is suboptimal, as images and videos in different settings vary tremendously in complexity. On the other hand, choosing the trade-off dynamically requires knowledge about the accuracy of different structured models on any given example. In this work, we propose a novel two-tier architecture that provides dynamic speed/accuracy trade-offs through a simple type of introspection. Our approach, which we call dynamic structured model selection (DMS), leverages typically intractable features in structured learning problems in order to automatically determine ’ which of several models should be used at test-time in order to maximize accuracy under a fixed budgetary constraint. We demonstrate DMS on two sequential modeling vision tasks, and we establish a new state-of-the-art in human pose estimation in video with an implementation that is roughly 23 faster than the prevaino uims sptleanmdeanrtda implementation.</p><p>5 0.73395908 <a title="411-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_CRFs_for_Image_Parsing_with_Adaptive_Subgradient_Descent.html">234 iccv-2013-Learning CRFs for Image Parsing with Adaptive Subgradient Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Honghui Zhang, Jingdong Wang, Ping Tan, Jinglu Wang, Long Quan</p><p>Abstract: We propose an adaptive subgradient descent method to efficiently learn the parameters of CRF models for image parsing. To balance the learning efficiency and performance of the learned CRF models, the parameter learning is iteratively carried out by solving a convex optimization problem in each iteration, which integrates a proximal term to preserve the previously learned information and the large margin preference to distinguish bad labeling and the ground truth labeling. A solution of subgradient descent updating form is derived for the convex optimization problem, with an adaptively determined updating step-size. Besides, to deal with partially labeled training data, we propose a new objective constraint modeling both the labeled and unlabeled parts in the partially labeled training data for the parameter learning of CRF models. The superior learning efficiency of the proposed method is verified by the experiment results on two public datasets. We also demonstrate the powerfulness of our method for handling partially labeled training data.</p><p>6 0.7329163 <a title="411-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_General_Dense_Image_Matching_Framework_Combining_Direct_and_Feature-Based_Costs.html">12 iccv-2013-A General Dense Image Matching Framework Combining Direct and Feature-Based Costs</a></p>

<p>Author: Bastien Jacquet, Christian Häne, Kevin Köser, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Although specular objects have gained interest in recent years, virtually no approaches exist for markerless reconstruction of reflective scenes in the wild. In this work, we present a practical approach to capturing normal maps in real-world scenes using video only. We focus on nearly planar surfaces such as windows, facades from glass or metal, or frames, screens and other indoor objects and show how normal maps of these can be obtained without the use of an artificial calibration object. Rather, we track the reflections of real-world straight lines, while moving with a hand-held or vehicle-mounted camera in front of the object. In contrast to error-prone local edge tracking, we obtain the reflections by a robust, global segmentation technique of an ortho-rectified 3D video cube that also naturally allows efficient user interaction. Then, at each point of the reflective surface, the resulting 2D-curve to 3D-line correspondence provides a novel quadratic constraint on the local surface normal. This allows to globally solve for the shape by integrability and smoothness constraints and easily supports the usage of multiple lines. We demonstrate the technique on several objects and facades.</p><p>3 0.14210086 <a title="250-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Complex_3D_General_Object_Reconstruction_from_Line_Drawings.html">84 iccv-2013-Complex 3D General Object Reconstruction from Line Drawings</a></p>
<p>Author: Linjie Yang, Jianzhuang Liu, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: An important topic in computer vision is 3D object reconstruction from line drawings. Previous algorithms either deal with simple general objects or are limited to only manifolds (a subset of solids). In this paper, we propose a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of complex general objects, including manifolds, non-manifold solids, and non-solids. Through developing some 3D object properties, we use the degree of freedom of objects to decompose a complex line drawing into multiple simpler line drawings that represent meaningful building blocks of a complex object. After 3D objects are reconstructed from the decomposed line drawings, they are merged to form a complex object from their touching faces, edges, and vertices. Our experiments show a number of reconstruction examples from both complex line drawings and images with line drawings superimposed. Comparisons are also given to indicate that our algorithm can deal with much more complex line drawings of general objects than previous algorithms. 1. Introduction and Related Work A 2D line drawing is the most straightforward way of illustrating a 3D object. Given a line drawing representing a 3D object, our visual system can understand the 3D structure easily. For example, we can interpret without difficulty the line drawing shown in Fig. 1(a) as a castle with four walls and one door. Imitating this ability has been a longstanding and challenging topic in computer vision when a line drawing is as complex as this example. The applications of this work include 3D object design in CAD and for 3D printers, 3D query generation for 3D object retrieval, and 3D modeling from images. In this paper, same as the majority of related work, a line drawing is defined as the orthogonal projection of the Fig.1 (a)Alinedrawing(rae)pres nti gac stle.(b)The3Dm(obd)el of the line drawing. edges and vertices of a 3D object in a generic view, and objects with planar surfaces are considered. A line drawing is represented by an edge-vertex graph. It can be obtained by the user/designer who draws on the screen with a tablet pen, a mouse, or a finger (on a touch sensitive screen), with all, with some, or without hidden edges and vertices. Line labeling is the earliest work to interpret line drawings [1], [17]. It searches for a set of consistent labels such as convex, concave, and occluding from a line drawing to test its correctness and/or realizability. Line labeling itself cannot recover 3D shape from a line drawing. Later, 3D reconstruction from the contours (line drawings) of objects in images is studied [19], [14], [13], which handles simple objects only. Model-based 3D reconstruction [2], [3], [20] can deal with more complex objects, but these methods require to pre-define a set of parametric models. Recently, popular methods of 3D reconstruction from line drawings are optimization based, which are most related to our work and are reviewed next. These methods can be classified into two categories: one dealing with manifolds and the other dealing with general objects. A general object can be a manifold, non-manifold solid, or non-solid. Manifolds are a subset of solids, defined as follows: A manifold, or more rigorously 2D manifold, is a solid where every point on its surface has a neighborhood topologically equivalent to an open diskin the 2D Euclidean space. 1433 In this paper, a solid is a portion of 3D space bounded by planar faces, and a manifold is also bounded by planar faces. Each edge of such manifolds is shared exactly by two faces [4]. Most 3D reconstruction methods from a line drawing assume that the face topology of the line drawing is known in advance. This information can reduce the reconstruction complexity greatly. Algorithms have been developed to find faces from a line drawing in [16], [10], and [9], where [16] and [10] are for general objects and [9] for manifolds. Optimization-based 3D reconstruction depends on some critera (also called image regularities) that simulate our visual perception. Marill proposes a very simple but effective criterion to reconstruct a simple object: minimizing the standard deviation of the angles (MSDA) in the object [11]. Later, other regularities are proposed to deal with more complex objects such as face planarity, line parallelism, isometry, and corner orthogonality [5], [6], [15], [18]. In these methods, an objective function ?C Φ(z1,z2, ...,zNv) = ?ωiφi(z1,z2, ...,zNv) (1) i?= ?1 is minimized to derive the depths z1, z2 , ..., zNv , where Nv is the number of vertices in the line drawing, φi , i = 1, 2, ..., C, are the regularities, and ωi , i = 1, 2, ..., C, are the weights. The main problem in this approach is that these algorithms are easy to get trapped into local minima (obtaining failed results) when a line drawing is complex with many vertices, due to the search in a highdimensional space (Nv dimensions) with the non-convex objective function. For example, the search space is of 56 dimensions for the object in Fig. 1(a). To alleviate this problem, Liu et al. formulate 3D reconstruction in a lower dimensional space so that the optimization procedure has a better chance to find desired results [7]. For the complex object in Fig. 1(a), however, the search in a space with 18 dimensions is still too difficult for it to obtain a satisfactory 3D object (see Section 3). The methods in [5], [6], [15], [18], and [7] reconstruct general objects, and the one in [7] can deal with more complex objects than the other four. But these algorithms cannot avoid the local minimum problem in a high dimensional search space when a line drawing is complex. In [8], a divide-and-conquer (D&C;) strategy is used to tackle this problem. It first separates a complex line drawing into multiple simpler ones, then independently recovers the 3D objects from these line drawings, and finally merges them to form a complete object. Since the separated line drawings are much simpler than the original one, the 3D reconstruction from each of them is an easy task. This D&C; approach handles manifolds only. Based on known faces found by the face identification algorithm in [9], it uses manifold properties to find internal faces Fig.2(a)Asimaeplhdmiafnbo(ldagc)withnae'fahdc'eisfba'nd(obgcn)'eitrnalfce (a, b, c, d).

(d) Expected decomposition of (c). from a line drawing and then separates the line drawing from the internal faces. An internal face is defined as an imaginary face lying inside a manifold with only its edges visible on the surface [8]. It is not a real face but can be considered as two coincident real faces of identical shape belonging to two manifolds. For example, Fig. 2(a) shows a manifold with nine faces. The D&C; first finds the internal face (a, b, c, d) and then decomposes the line drawing from this internal face (Fig. 2(b)). However, handling manifolds only limits the applica- tions of [8]. In many applications in computer vision and graphics such as 3D object matching, retrieval, and rendering, it is unnecessary to represent objects as manifolds, in order to facilitate data processing and reduce data storage. For example, a flat ground can be represented by a sheet (one face), but if it is represented by a manifold, a thin box with six faces has to be used. Fig. 1(a), Fig. 3(a), and Fig. 3(c) are line drawings of three non-manifolds. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of complex general objects based on visual perception, object properties, and new line drawing decomposition. Compared with previous methods, ours can deal with much more complex line drawings of general objects. It can handle not only manifolds but also non-manifold solids and non-solids, and is insensitive to sketching errors. 2. General Object Reconstruction We also use the D&C; strategy to deal with 3D reconstruction from a line drawing representing a complex general object. The key is how to decompose a complex line drawing of any objects into multiple simpler line drawings. These decomposed line drawings should represent objects that are in accordance with our visual perception, which makes the 3D reconstruction from these line drawings easier and better because the regularities used to build an objective function for reconstruction follow human perception of 1434 common objects [11], [5], [6], [15], [18]. Before the decomposition of a line drawing, we assume that all the real and internal faces of the object have been obtained from the line drawing using a face identification algorithm. For example, the algorithm in [10] finds 10 faces from the line drawing in Fig. 2(a) (including the internal face), and obtains 12 and 7 faces from the line drawings in Figs. 3(a) and (c), respectively. 2.1. Decomposing line drawings of solids In this subsection, we consider the line drawings of solids first. The decomposition method will be extended to the line drawings of general objects in the next subsection. It is not difficult to see that in general, a complex object, especially a manmade complex object, can be considered as the combinations of multiple smaller objects. The most common combination is the touch of two faces from two different objects such as the one in Fig. 2. Other combinations are the touches among lines, faces, and vertices. Our target is to decompose a complex solid into multiple primitive solids. Before the definition of a primitive solid, we introduce a term called the degree of freedom of a solid. Definition 1. The degree of freedom (DoF) of a 3D solid represented by a line drawing is the minimal number of zcoordinates that can uniquely determine this 3D solid. This is the first time that the concept of DoF is used to decompose line drawings. Now let us consider a simple object in Fig. 4(a). The cube has six faces: (v1, v2 , v3 , v4), (v1, v2, v6, v5), (v1, v4, v8, v5), (v2 , v3, v7, v6), (v4, v3, v7, v8), and (v6, v7, v8, v5). We can show that the cube is determined if the z-coordinates of its four non-coplanar vertices are known. Without loss of generality, suppose z1, z2, z4, and z5 are known. Since the 3D coordinates of v1, v2, and v4 are fixed (remind that the x- and y-coordinates of all the vertices are known under the orthogonal projection), the 3D plane passing through the face (v1, v2 , v3, v4) is determined, and thus z3 can be calculated. Similarly, z6 and z8 can be obtained. Finally, z7 can be computed with the 3D coordinates of v3, v4, and v8 known, which determine the plane passing through the face (v4, v3, v7, v8). So the 3D cube can be determined by the known four z-coordinates, z1, z2, z4, and z5. Further, it can be verified that three 3D vertices cannot determine this object uniquely because they can only define one face in 3D space. Therefore, the DoF of the cube is 4. Similar analysis allows us to know that the solids in Fig. 2(b), Fig. 3(b), and Fig. 4(b) all have DoF 4, while the two solids in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 3(a) have DoFs 5 and 6, respectively. From these analysis, we can have the intuition that solids with DoF 4 serve as the building blocks of more complex solids whose DoFs are more than 4. Besides, we have the following property: Property 1. There is no solid with DoF less than 4. Fv5(1iga).4v (26a)Av48cubev3w7hos(be)DoFis4.(b)Anedo(tch)fergBasbolifdAwhosfCeDocFji is also 4. (c) Part of a line drawing with each vertex of degree 3. This property is easy to verify. A solid with fewest faces is a tetrahedron. Every two of its four faces are not co-planar. Three 3D vertices of a tetrahedron can only determine one 3D face. Next, we define primitive solids. Definition 2. A 3D solid represented by a line drawing is called a primitive solid if its DoF is 4. Property 2. If every vertex of a 3D solid represented by a line drawing has degree 31, then it is a primitive solid. Proof. Let part of such a line drawing be the one as shown in Fig. 4(c). At each vertex, every two of the three edges form a face, because a solid is bounded by faces without dangling faces and edges. Let the three paths fA, fB, and fC in Fig. 4(c) denote the three faces at vertex a. Without loss of generality, suppose that the four zcoordinates (and thus the four 3D coordinates) of vertices a, b, c, and d are known. Then the three planes passing through fA, fB, and fC are determined in 3D space. With the two known 3D planes passing through fA and fB at vertex b, the 3D coordinates of vertices g and h connected to b can be computed. Similarly, the 3D coordinates of vertices e and f connected to d and the 3D coordinates of vertices i and j connected to c can be obtained. Furthermore, all the 3D coordinates of the other vertices connected to e, f, g, h, i, and j can be derived in the same way. This derivation can propagate to all the vertices of this solid. Therefore, the DoF of this solid is 4 and it is a primitive solid. Property 3. The DoF of a solid is 5 which is obtained by gluing two faces of two primitive solids. Proof. Let the two primitive solids be PS1 and PS2 and their corresponding gluing faces be f1and f2, respectively. The DoFs of PS1 and PS2 are both 4. Suppose that PS1 is determined in 3D space, which requires four z-coordinates. Then f1and f2 are also determined in 3D space. When the z-coordinates of three vertices on PS2 are known based on f2, one more z-coordinate of a vertex not coplanar with f2 on PS2 can determine PS2 in 3D space. Therefore, the DoF of the combined solid is 5. Fig. 2 is a typical example of two primitive solids gluing together along faces. Fig. 3(a) is an example of two primitive solids gluing together along edges. Two primitive solids may also connect at one vertex. The following property is easy to verify. 1The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to this vertex. 1435 Property 4. The DoF of a solid is 6 which is obtained by gluing two edges of two primitive solids. The DoF of a solid is 7 which is obtained by gluing two vertices oftwoprimitive solids. From the above properties, we can see that primitive solids are indeed the “smallest” solids in terms of DoF and they can serve as the building blocks to construct more complex solids. Therefore, our next target is to decompose a line drawing representing a complex solid into multiple line drawings representing primitive solids. Before giving Definition 3, we define some terms first. Vertex set of a face. The vertex set V er(f) of a face f is the set of all the vertices of f. Fixed vertex. A fixed vertex is one with its z-coordinate (thus its 3D coordinate) known. Unfixed vertex. An unfixed vertex is one with its zcoordinate unknown. Fixed face. A fixed face is one with its 3D position determined by its three fixed vertices. Unfixed face. An unfixed face is one with its 3D position undetermined. Definition 3. Let the vertex set and the face set of a line drawing be V = {v1, v2 , ..., vn} and F = {f1, f2 , ..., fm}, respectively, w =he {rve n and m are Fthe = n{fumbers of th}e, vertices and the faces, respectively. Also let Vfixed, Ffixed, Vunfixed, and Funfixed be the sets of fixed vertices, fixed faces, unfixed vertices, and unfixed faces, respectively. Suppose that an initial set of two fixed neighboring faces sharing an edge is Finitial with all their fixed vertices in Vinitial. The final Ffixed in Algorithm 1 is called the maximum extended face set (MEFS) from Finitial. In Algorithm 1, a face f that satisfies the condition in step 3 is a face that has been determined in 3D space by the current fixed vertices in Ffixed. When this face is found, it becomes a fixed face and all its vertices become fixed vertices. The DoF of the initial two fixed faces combined is 4. It is not difficult to see that the algorithm does not increase the initial DoF, and thus the final object represented by the MEFS also has DoF 4. Next, let us consider a simple example shown in Fig. 2(a) with the following three cases: Case 1. Suppose that Finitial = {(e, f,g, h) , (e, f,b, a)}, Vinitial = {e, f,g, h, b, a}, and th{e( algorithm a(de,dfs tbh,ea f}a,c Ves into Ffixed ,ing thh,isb aor}d,e ar:n (f th,e g, c, obr)i →m (a, b, c, d) → (e, h, d, a) →i ( tgh, hs, odr, dce)r.

Note that the algorithm does not add any triangular faces into Ffixed because they do not satisfy the condition in step 3. Case 2.

Fig.5(a)Ac(oam)plexinedrawingofn (-bm)anifolds id.(b)The decomposition result by our algorithm. In case 3, the object represented by the MEFS has only two initial faces and this object is discarded. In order not to miss a primitive solid, we run Algorithm 1 multiple times each with a different pair of neighboring faces in Finitial. Then, we can always have Finitial with its two faces from one primitive solid. For the object in Fig. 2(a), we can always find the cube and the pyramid. Note that the same primitive solid may be found multiple times from different Finitial, and finally we keep only one copy of each different object (cube and pyramid in this example). When a complex solid is formed by more than two primitive solids, Algorithm 1 can still be used to find the primitive solids, which is the decomposition result of the complex line drawing. More complex examples are given in Section 3. Besides, Algorithm 1 can also deal with complex solids formed by gluing primitive solids between edges and vertices. Fig. 5(a) is a solid constructed by gluing eight primitive solids between faces, edges, and vertices. Running Algorithm 1multiple times with different pairs of neighboring faces in Finitial generates the primitive solids as shown in Fig. 5(b). 2.2. Decomposing line drawings of general objects A general object can be a manifold, non-manifold solid, or non-solid. Given a line drawing representing a general object, it is unknown whether this object consists of only primitive solids. However, we can always apply Algorithm 1to the line drawing multiple times, each with a 1436 Obj6(4)O b j 15( 94)(ca)O b j 24(9 7)Obj3(7)(bd) Fig. 6. Illustration of our decomposition method.

(d) The decomposition of (a). different pair of neighboring faces in Finitial, generating a set SMEFS of MEFSs (recall that an MEFS with only two initial neighboring faces is discarded). In what follows, we also call an MEFS an object, which is represented by the MEFS. Note that an MEFS generated from a general line drawing may not be a primitive solid, but its DoF must be 4. Objects of DoF 4 have relatively simple structures and are easy to be reconstructed. A number of decomposition examples of complex general line drawings can be seen from the experimental section. One issue existing in this decomposition method is that two different MEFSs may share many faces. For example, from the line drawing in Fig. 6(a), all different MEFSs found by running Algorithm 1multiple times are shown in Fig. 6(b), where Obj 1and Obj 5 share four faces, and so do Obj 2 and Obj 6. Obviously, Obj 5 and Obj 6 are not necessary. Next we define object coexistence and a rule to choose objects. Definition 4. Two objects are called coexistent if they share no face or share only coplanar faces. Rule 1. Choose a subset of SMEFS such that in the subset, all the objects are coexistent and the number of total faces is maximized. From Definition 4, Obj 1 and Obj 5 are not coexistent in Fig. 6, and Obj 2 and Obj 6 are not either. If Obj 5 and Obj 6 are kept with Obj 1and Obj 2 discarded, many faces in the original object will be missing. Rule 1guarantees that Obj 1and Obj 2 are kept but not Obj 5 and Obj 6.

Fig.7 (a)Ashe tobjec(ta)with23faces.(b)Decompositon(br)esult by Algorithm 2 with the modification in Algorithm 1. We formulate Rule 1 as a maximum weight clique problem (MWCP), which is to find a clique2 of the maximum weight from a weighted graph. First, we construct a weighted graph, called the object-coexistence graph, in which a vertex denotes an object in SMEFS and there is an edge connecting two vertices if the two objects represented by the two vertices are coexistent. Besides, each vertex is assigned a weight equal to the number of the faces of the corresponding object. The MWCP is a well-known NP-hard problem. In our application, however, solving this problem is fast enough since an object-coexistence graph usually has less than 20 objects (vertices). We use the algorithm in [12] to deal with this problem. Fig. 6(c) is the object-coexistence graph constructed from the six objects in Fig. 6(b), where the weights of the vertices are denoted by the numbers in the parentheses. The maximum weight clique is shown in bold. From Fig. 6, we see that the face (14, 13, 26, 25) is not contained in SWMC, which is used to store the objects in the maximum weight clique. This face is finally attached to Obj 3. In general, each of the faces not in SWMC is attached to an object that contains the maximum number of the vertices of this face. If there are two or more objects that contain the same number of the vertices of this face, this face is assigned to any of them. 2A clique is a subgraph of a graph such that subgraph are connected by an edge. every two vertices in the 1437 Algorithm 2 shows the complete algorithm to decompose a general line drawing. Steps 7 and 8 attach the faces not in SMWC to some objects in SMWC. A common complex object usually consists of primitive solids and sheets, and Algorithm 2 works well for the decomposition of most complex line drawings. However, there are still some line drawings the algorithm cannot deal with. Such an example is shown in Fig. 7(a) which is a sheet object with 23 faces. In Algorithm 1, with any pair of initial neighboring faces, there is no any other face satisfying the condition in step 3, thus no object of DoF 4 will be found. The following scheme can solve this problem. Given a line drawing, steps 1–6 in Algorithm 2 are used to decompose it into multiple objects of DoF 4. If there are separate groups of faces not in SMWC, where the faces in each group are connected, then attach the groups each with less than four faces to some objects in SMWC3 (the attachment method is similar to steps 7 and 8 in Algorithm 2). For a group with four or more connected faces, Algorithm 2 is applied to it with a minor modification in Algorithm 1. The modification is to set Finitial to contain three connected faces whose combined DoF is 5. This modification allows the search of objects of DoF 5. Suppose the object in Fig. 7(a) is such a group. Applying Algorithm 2 to it with the minor modification generates the decomposition result as shown in Fig. 7(b). 2.3. 3D Reconstruction A complex line drawing can be decomposed into several simpler ones using the method proposed in Sections 2. 1 and 2.2. The next step is to reconstruct a 3D object from each ofthem, which is an easy task because the decomposed line drawings are simple. The method in [6] or [7] can carry out this task very well. We use the one in [6] for our work with the objective function Φ(z1 , z2 , ..., zNv ) constructed by these five image regularities: MSDA, face planarity, line parallelism, isometry, and corner orthogonality. The details of the regularities can be found from [6]. After obtaining the 3D objects from all the decomposed line drawings, the next step is to merge them to form one complex object. When merging two 3D objects, since they are reconstructed separately, the gluing parts (face or edge) of them are usually not of the same size. Then one object is automatically rescaled according to the sizes of the two gluing parts, and the vertices of the gluing part of this object are also adjusted so that the two parts are the same. After merging all the 3D objects, the whole object is fine-tuned by minimizing the objective function Φ on the object. We can also apply our method to reconstruct 3D shapes from objects in images. First, the user draws a line drawing along the visible edges of an object and he/she can also 3The reason to attach a group with less than four faces to an object in SMWC is that this group is small and is not necessary to be an independent object to reconstruct. guess (draw) the hidden edges. Then from this line drawing, our approach described above reconstructs the 3D geometry of the object in the image. 3. Experimental Results In this section, we show a number of complex 3D reconstruction examples from both line drawings and images to demonstrate the performance of our approach. The first set of experiments in Fig. 8 has nine complex line drawings. Fig. 8(a) is a manifold, and the others are nonmanifold solids or non-solids. The decompositions of the line drawings are also given in the figure, from which we can see that the results are in accordance with our visual perception very well. All the primitive solids are found by our algorithm. It is the successful decompositions that make the 3D reconstructions from these complex line drawings possible. The expected satisfactory reconstruction results are shown also in Fig. 8 each in two views. Fig. 9 shows another set of 3D reconstructions from objects in images with line drawings drawn on the objects. The decomposition results are omitted due to the space limitation. Each reconstruction result obtained by our algorithm is shown in two views with the texture from the image mapped onto the surface. We can see that the results are very good. The details of the objects and the line drawings can be shown by enlarging the figures on the screen. Among all the previous algorithms for general object reconstruction, the one in [7] can deal with most complex objects. Due to the local minimum problem in a high dimensional search space, however, this algorithm cannot handle line drawings as complex as those in Figs. 8 and 9. For example, Fig. 10(a) shows its reconstruction result from the line drawing in Fig. 8(c), which is a failure. The reader may wonder what happens if the 3D reconstruction is based on an arbitrary decomposition of a complex line drawing, instead of the proposed one. Fig. 10(b) shows such a decomposition from Fig. 8(c). Based on this decomposition, the 3D reconstruction result obtained by the scheme described in Section 2.3 is given in Fig. 10(c), which is a failure. The failure is caused by two reasons: (i) An arbitrary decomposition usually does not generate common objects, which makes the image regularities less meaningful for the 3D reconstruction. (ii) The gluing of 3D objects from the decomposition in Fig. 10(b) is difficult because of the irregular touches between the objects. The fine-tuning processing (see Section 2.3) cannot reduce the large distortion to an acceptable result. Note that since our algorithm is not limited to manifolds, it can deal with line drawings with some or without hidden lines. The third line drawing in Fig. 9 is an example where some hidden lines are not drawn. Most of the line drawings in this paper look tidy. This 1438 (g)(h)(i) Fig. 8.

In fact, our algorithm is not sensitive to sketching errors. Take Fig. 8(a) as an example and assume it is an accurate projection of the 3D object. Then, random variations are generated with the Gaussian distribution N(0, σ2) on the 2D locations of the vertices. Fig. 11(a) is a resulting noisy line drawing with σ = W/200 where W is the width of the line drawing in Fig. 8(a). From Fig. 11, we see that even for this line drawing with strong sketching errors, our algorithm can still obtain the good reconstruction result. Our algorithm is implemented in C++. The computational time includes two parts: line drawing decomposition and 3D reconstruction. The main computation is consumed by the second part. On average, a common PC takes about one minute to obtain the reconstruction from each of the line drawings in Figs. 8 and 9. 4. Conclusion Previous algorithms of 3D object reconstruction from line drawings either deal with simple general objects or are limited to only manifolds (a subset of solids). In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach that can handle complex general objects, including manifolds, nonmanifold solids, and non-solids. It decomposes a complex line drawing into simpler ones according to the degree of freedom of objects, which is based on the developed 3D object properties. After 3D objects are reconstructed from the decomposed line drawings, they are merged to form a complex object. We have shown a number of reconstruction examples with comparison to the best previous algorithm. The results indicate that our algorithm can tackle much more complex line drawings of general objects and is insensitive to sketching errors. The future work includes (i) the correction of the distortions of 3D objects reconstructed from images caused by the perspective projection, and (ii) the extension of this work to objects with curved faces.

<p>Author: Srikumar Ramalingam, Matthew Brand</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel and an efficient method for reconstructing the 3D arrangement of lines extracted from a single image, using vanishing points, orthogonal structure, and an optimization procedure that considers all plausible connectivity constraints between lines. Line detection identifies a large number of salient lines that intersect or nearly intersect in an image, but relatively a few of these apparent junctions correspond to real intersections in the 3D scene. We use linear programming (LP) to identify a minimal set of least-violated connectivity constraints that are sufficient to unambiguously reconstruct the 3D lines. In contrast to prior solutions that primarily focused on well-behaved synthetic line drawings with severely restricting assumptions, we develop an algorithm that can work on real images. The algorithm produces line reconstruction by identifying 95% correct connectivity constraints in York Urban database, with a total computation time of 1 second per image.</p><p>2 0.73412806 <a title="250-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-An_Enhanced_Structure-from-Motion_Paradigm_Based_on_the_Absolute_Dual_Quadric_and_Images_of_Circular_Points.html">49 iccv-2013-An Enhanced Structure-from-Motion Paradigm Based on the Absolute Dual Quadric and Images of Circular Points</a></p>
<p>Author: Lilian Calvet, Pierre Gurdjos</p><p>Abstract: This work aims at introducing a new unified Structurefrom-Motion (SfM) paradigm in which images of circular point-pairs can be combined with images of natural points. An imaged circular point-pair encodes the 2D Euclidean structure of a world plane and can easily be derived from the image of a planar shape, especially those including circles. A classical SfM method generally runs two steps: first a projective factorization of all matched image points (into projective cameras and points) and second a camera selfcalibration that updates the obtained world from projective to Euclidean. This work shows how to introduce images of circular points in these two SfM steps while its key contribution is to provide the theoretical foundations for combining “classical” linear self-calibration constraints with additional ones derived from such images. We show that the two proposed SfM steps clearly contribute to better results than the classical approach. We validate our contributions on synthetic and real images.</p><p>3 0.72943866 <a title="250-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Intrinsic_Calibration_from_a_Single_Frame_Using_a_%22Plumb-Line%22_Approach.html">436 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Intrinsic Calibration from a Single Frame Using a "Plumb-Line" Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Anne Jordt-Sedlazeck, Reinhard Koch</p><p>Abstract: In underwater environments, cameras need to be confined in an underwater housing, viewing the scene through a piece of glass. In case of flat port underwater housings, light rays entering the camera housing are refracted twice, due to different medium densities of water, glass, and air. This causes the usually linear rays of light to bend and the commonly used pinhole camera model to be invalid. When using the pinhole camera model without explicitly modeling refraction in Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods, a systematic model error occurs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a system for computing camera path and 3D points with explicit incorporation of refraction using new methods for pose estimation. Additionally, a new error function is introduced for non-linear optimization, especially bundle adjustment. The proposed method allows to increase reconstruction accuracy and is evaluated in a set of experiments, where the proposed method’s performance is compared to SfM with the perspective camera model.</p><p>5 0.71226758 <a title="250-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_3D_Reconstruction_from_Uncalibrated_Radially-Symmetric_Cameras.html">280 iccv-2013-Multi-view 3D Reconstruction from Uncalibrated Radially-Symmetric Cameras</a></p>
<p>Author: Jae-Hak Kim, Yuchao Dai, Hongdong Li, Xin Du, Jonghyuk Kim</p><p>Abstract: We present a new multi-view 3D Euclidean reconstruction method for arbitrary uncalibrated radially-symmetric cameras, which needs no calibration or any camera model parameters other than radial symmetry. It is built on the radial 1D camera model [25], a unified mathematical abstraction to different types of radially-symmetric cameras. We formulate the problem of multi-view reconstruction for radial 1D cameras as a matrix rank minimization problem. Efficient implementation based on alternating direction continuation is proposed to handle scalability issue for real-world applications. Our method applies to a wide range of omnidirectional cameras including both dioptric and catadioptric (central and non-central) cameras. Additionally, our method deals with complete and incomplete measurements under a unified framework elegantly. Experiments on both synthetic and real images from various types of cameras validate the superior performance of our new method, in terms of numerical accuracy and robustness.</p><p>6 0.64571702 <a title="250-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Pose_Estimation_with_Unknown_Focal_Length_Using_Points%2C_Directions_and_Lines.html">323 iccv-2013-Pose Estimation with Unknown Focal Length Using Points, Directions and Lines</a></p>

<p>Author: Chang Ma, Zhongqian Dong, Tingting Jiang, Yizhou Wang, Wen Gao</p><p>Abstract: In thispaper, wepropose a novelperception-based shape decomposition method which aims to decompose a shape into semantically meaningful parts. In addition to three popular perception rules (the Minima rule, the Short-cut rule and the Convexity rule) in shape decomposition, we propose a new rule named part-similarity rule to encourage consistent partition of similar parts. The problem is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and is solved by a trust-region method. Experiment results on MPEG-7 dataset show that we can get a more consistent shape decomposition with human perception compared with other state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, we show the advantage of semantic parts over non-meaningful parts in object detection on the ETHZ dataset.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.88947511 <a title="250-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Lifting_3D_Manhattan_Lines_from_a_Single_Image.html">250 iccv-2013-Lifting 3D Manhattan Lines from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Srikumar Ramalingam, Matthew Brand</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel and an efficient method for reconstructing the 3D arrangement of lines extracted from a single image, using vanishing points, orthogonal structure, and an optimization procedure that considers all plausible connectivity constraints between lines. Line detection identifies a large number of salient lines that intersect or nearly intersect in an image, but relatively a few of these apparent junctions correspond to real intersections in the 3D scene. We use linear programming (LP) to identify a minimal set of least-violated connectivity constraints that are sufficient to unambiguously reconstruct the 3D lines. In contrast to prior solutions that primarily focused on well-behaved synthetic line drawings with severely restricting assumptions, we develop an algorithm that can work on real images. The algorithm produces line reconstruction by identifying 95% correct connectivity constraints in York Urban database, with a total computation time of 1 second per image.</p><p>3 0.87419081 <a title="250-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Generalized_Iterated_Shrinkage_Algorithm_for_Non-convex_Sparse_Coding.html">14 iccv-2013-A Generalized Iterated Shrinkage Algorithm for Non-convex Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Wangmeng Zuo, Deyu Meng, Lei Zhang, Xiangchu Feng, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In many sparse coding based image restoration and image classification problems, using non-convex ?p-norm minimization (0 ≤ p < 1) can often obtain better results than timhei convex 0?1 -norm m 1)ini camniza otfiteonn. Ab naiunm bbeetrt of algorithms, e.g., iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), iteratively thresholding method (ITM-?p), and look-up table (LUT), have been proposed for non-convex ?p-norm sparse coding, while some analytic solutions have been suggested for some specific values of p. In this paper, by extending the popular soft-thresholding operator, we propose a generalized iterated shrinkage algorithm (GISA) for ?p-norm non-convex sparse coding. Unlike the analytic solutions, the proposed GISA algorithm is easy to implement, and can be adopted for solving non-convex sparse coding problems with arbitrary p values. Compared with LUT, GISA is more general and does not need to compute and store the look-up tables. Compared with IRLS and ITM-?p, GISA is theoretically more solid and can achieve more accurate solutions. Experiments on image restoration and sparse coding based face recognition are conducted to validate the performance of GISA. ××</p><p>4 0.83897567 <a title="250-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Modeling_4D_Human-Object_Interactions_for_Event_and_Object_Recognition.html">268 iccv-2013-Modeling 4D Human-Object Interactions for Event and Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Wei, Yibiao Zhao, Nanning Zheng, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing the events and objects in the video sequence are two challenging tasks due to the complex temporal structures and the large appearance variations. In this paper, we propose a 4D human-object interaction model, where the two tasks jointly boost each other. Our human-object interaction is defined in 4D space: i) the cooccurrence and geometric constraints of human pose and object in 3D space; ii) the sub-events transition and objects coherence in 1D temporal dimension. We represent the structure of events, sub-events and objects in a hierarchical graph. For an input RGB-depth video, we design a dynamic programming beam search algorithm to: i) segment the video, ii) recognize the events, and iii) detect the objects simultaneously. For evaluation, we built a large-scale multiview 3D event dataset which contains 3815 video sequences and 383,036 RGBD frames captured by the Kinect cameras. The experiment results on this dataset show the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>5 0.81828201 <a title="250-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Structured_Model_Selection.html">130 iccv-2013-Dynamic Structured Model Selection</a></p>
<p>Author: David Weiss, Benjamin Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: Ben Taskar University of Washington Seattle, WA t as kar @ c s . washingt on . edu In many cases, the predictive power of structured models for for complex vision tasks is limited by a trade-off between the expressiveness and the computational tractability of the model. However, choosing this trade-off statically a priori is suboptimal, as images and videos in different settings vary tremendously in complexity. On the other hand, choosing the trade-off dynamically requires knowledge about the accuracy of different structured models on any given example. In this work, we propose a novel two-tier architecture that provides dynamic speed/accuracy trade-offs through a simple type of introspection. Our approach, which we call dynamic structured model selection (DMS), leverages typically intractable features in structured learning problems in order to automatically determine ’ which of several models should be used at test-time in order to maximize accuracy under a fixed budgetary constraint. We demonstrate DMS on two sequential modeling vision tasks, and we establish a new state-of-the-art in human pose estimation in video with an implementation that is roughly 23 faster than the prevaino uims sptleanmdeanrtda implementation.</p><p>6 0.81786919 <a title="250-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_CRFs_for_Image_Parsing_with_Adaptive_Subgradient_Descent.html">234 iccv-2013-Learning CRFs for Image Parsing with Adaptive Subgradient Descent</a></p>

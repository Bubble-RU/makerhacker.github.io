<p>Author: Dingzeyu Li, Qifeng Chen, Chi-Keung Tang</p><p>Abstract: This paper demonstrates how the nonlocal principle benefits video matting via the KNN Laplacian, which comes with a straightforward implementation using motionaware K nearest neighbors. In hindsight, the fundamental problem to solve in video matting is to produce spatiotemporally coherent clusters of moving foreground pixels. When used as described, the motion-aware KNN Laplacian is effective in addressing this fundamental problem, as demonstrated by sparse user markups typically on only one frame in a variety of challenging examples featuring ambiguous foreground and background colors, changing topologies with disocclusion, significant illumination changes, fast motion, and motion blur. When working with existing Laplacian-based systems, our Laplacian is expected to benefit them immediately with improved clustering of moving foreground pixels.</p><p>3 0.11106245 <a title="19-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Potts_Model%2C_Parametric_Maxflow_and_K-Submodular_Functions.html">324 iccv-2013-Potts Model, Parametric Maxflow and K-Submodular Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Igor Gridchyn, Vladimir Kolmogorov</p><p>Abstract: The problem of minimizing the Potts energy function frequently occurs in computer vision applications. One way to tackle this NP-hard problem was proposed by Kovtun [20, 21]. It identifies a part of an optimal solution by running k maxflow computations, where k is the number of labels. The number of “labeled” pixels can be significant in some applications, e.g. 50-93% in our tests for stereo. We show how to reduce the runtime to O(log k) maxflow computations (or one parametric maxflow computation). Furthermore, the output of our algorithm allows to speed-up the subsequent alpha expansion for the unlabeled part, or can be used as it is for time-critical applications. To derive our technique, we generalize the algorithm of Felzenszwalb et al. [7] for Tree Metrics. We also show a connection to k-submodular functions from combinatorial optimization, and discuss k-submodular relaxations for general energy functions.</p><p>4 0.059964437 <a title="19-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Constant_Time_Weighted_Median_Filtering_for_Stereo_Matching_and_Beyond.html">88 iccv-2013-Constant Time Weighted Median Filtering for Stereo Matching and Beyond</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziyang Ma, Kaiming He, Yichen Wei, Jian Sun, Enhua Wu</p><p>Abstract: Despite the continuous advances in local stereo matching for years, most efforts are on developing robust cost computation and aggregation methods. Little attention has been seriously paid to the disparity refinement. In this work, we study weighted median filtering for disparity refinement. We discover that with this refinement, even the simple box filter aggregation achieves comparable accuracy with various sophisticated aggregation methods (with the same refinement). This is due to the nice weighted median filtering properties of removing outlier error while respecting edges/structures. This reveals that the previously overlooked refinement can be at least as crucial as aggregation. We also develop the first constant time algorithmfor the previously time-consuming weighted median filter. This makes the simple combination “box aggregation + weighted median ” an attractive solution in practice for both speed and accuracy. As a byproduct, the fast weighted median filtering unleashes its potential in other applications that were hampered by high complexities. We show its superiority in various applications such as depth upsampling, clip-art JPEG artifact removal, and image stylization.</p><p>5 0.054980751 <a title="19-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Probabilistic_Volumetric_Models.html">128 iccv-2013-Dynamic Probabilistic Volumetric Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Osman Ulusoy, Octavian Biris, Joseph L. Mundy</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic volumetric framework for image based modeling of general dynamic 3-d scenes. The framework is targeted towards high quality modeling of complex scenes evolving over thousands of frames. Extensive storage and computational resources are required in processing large scale space-time (4-d) data. Existing methods typically store separate 3-d models at each time step and do not address such limitations. A novel 4-d representation is proposed that adaptively subdivides in space and time to explain the appearance of 3-d dynamic surfaces. This representation is shown to achieve compression of 4-d data and provide efficient spatio-temporal processing. The advances oftheproposedframework is demonstrated on standard datasets using free-viewpoint video and 3-d tracking applications.</p><p>6 0.053473882 <a title="19-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_New_Image_Quality_Metric_for_Image_Auto-denoising.html">23 iccv-2013-A New Image Quality Metric for Image Auto-denoising</a></p>

<p>Author: Ruixuan Wang, Emanuele Trucco</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a ‘low-rank prior’ for small oriented noise-free image patches: considering an oriented patch as a matrix, a low-rank matrix approximation is enough to preserve the texture details in the properly oriented patch. Based on this prior, we propose a single-patch method within a generalized joint low-rank and sparse matrix recovery framework to simultaneously detect and remove non-pointwise random-valued impulse noise (e.g., very small blobs). A weighting matrix is incorporated in the framework to encode an initial estimate of the spatial noise distribution. An accelerated proximal gradient method is adapted to estimate the optimal noise-free image patches. Experiments show the effectiveness of our framework in removing non-pointwise random-valued impulse noise.</p><p>3 0.61237848 <a title="19-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Generalized_Low-Rank_Appearance_Model_for_Spatio-temporally_Correlated_Rain_Streaks.html">15 iccv-2013-A Generalized Low-Rank Appearance Model for Spatio-temporally Correlated Rain Streaks</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi-Lei Chen, Chiou-Ting Hsu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank appearance model for removing rain streaks. Different from previous work, our method needs neither rain pixel detection nor time-consuming dictionary learning stage. Instead, as rain streaks usually reveal similar and repeated patterns on imaging scene, we propose and generalize a low-rank model from matrix to tensor structure in order to capture the spatio-temporally correlated rain streaks. With the appearance model, we thus remove rain streaks from image/video (and also other high-order image structure) in a unified way. Our experimental results demonstrate competitive (or even better) visual quality and efficient run-time in comparison with state of the art.</p><p>4 0.60153461 <a title="19-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Sparsity-Based_Orthogonal_Dictionary_Learning_for_Image_Restoration.html">161 iccv-2013-Fast Sparsity-Based Orthogonal Dictionary Learning for Image Restoration</a></p>
<p>Author: Chenglong Bao, Jian-Feng Cai, Hui Ji</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, how to learn a dictionary from input images for sparse modelling has been one very active topic in image processing and recognition. Most existing dictionary learning methods consider an over-complete dictionary, e.g. the K-SVD method. Often they require solving some minimization problem that is very challenging in terms of computational feasibility and efficiency. However, if the correlations among dictionary atoms are not well constrained, the redundancy of the dictionary does not necessarily improve the performance of sparse coding. This paper proposed a fast orthogonal dictionary learning method for sparse image representation. With comparable performance on several image restoration tasks, the proposed method is much more computationally efficient than the over-complete dictionary based learning methods.</p><p>5 0.57130361 <a title="19-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Cross-Field_Joint_Image_Restoration_via_Scale_Map.html">98 iccv-2013-Cross-Field Joint Image Restoration via Scale Map</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiong Yan, Xiaoyong Shen, Li Xu, Shaojie Zhuo, Xiaopeng Zhang, Liang Shen, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: Color, infrared, and flash images captured in different fields can be employed to effectively eliminate noise and other visual artifacts. We propose a two-image restoration framework considering input images in different fields, for example, one noisy color image and one dark-flashed nearinfrared image. The major issue in such a framework is to handle structure divergence and find commonly usable edges and smooth transition for visually compelling image reconstruction. We introduce a scale map as a competent representation to explicitly model derivative-level confidence and propose new functions and a numerical solver to effectively infer it following new structural observations. Our method is general and shows a principled way for cross-field restoration.</p><p>6 0.54773897 <a title="19-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-DCSH_-_Matching_Patches_in_RGBD_Images.html">101 iccv-2013-DCSH - Matching Patches in RGBD Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Kwang In Kim, James Tompkin, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: One fundamental assumption in object recognition as well as in other computer vision and pattern recognition problems is that the data generation process lies on a manifold and that it respects the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. This assumption is held in several successful algorithms for diffusion and regularization, in particular, in graph-Laplacian-based algorithms. We claim that the performance of existing algorithms can be improved if we additionally account for how the manifold is embedded within the ambient space, i.e., if we consider the extrinsic geometry of the manifold. We present a procedure for characterizing the extrinsic (as well as intrinsic) curvature of a manifold M which is described by a sampled point cloud in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Once estimated, we use this characterization in general diffusion and regularization on M, and form a new regularizer on a point cloud. The resulting re-weighted graph Laplacian demonstrates superior performance over classical graph Laplacian in semisupervised learning and spectral clustering.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.68951893 <a title="19-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-A_Learning-Based_Approach_to_Reduce_JPEG_Artifacts_in_Image_Matting.html">19 iccv-2013-A Learning-Based Approach to Reduce JPEG Artifacts in Image Matting</a></p>

The main idea is to combine two orthogonal sources of information: one is a classifier trained on strongly invariant features, which makes it applicable to images of very different conditions, but also leads to rather noisy predictions. The other is a label propagation step based on a more powerful similarity measure that however is only consistent within specific subsets of the data at a time. In our biological setup, the information sources are the shape and the staining patterns of embryo images. We show experimentally that while neither of the methods can be used by itself to achieve satisfactory results, their combination achieves prediction quality comparable to human per- formance.</p><p>4 0.65551406 <a title="19-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Shape_Index_Descriptors_Applied_to_Texture-Based_Galaxy_Analysis.html">388 iccv-2013-Shape Index Descriptors Applied to Texture-Based Galaxy Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Kim Steenstrup Pedersen, Kristoffer Stensbo-Smidt, Andrew Zirm, Christian Igel</p><p>Abstract: A texture descriptor based on the shape index and the accompanying curvedness measure is proposed, and it is evaluated for the automated analysis of astronomical image data. A representative sample of images of low-redshift galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) serves as a testbed. The goal of applying texture descriptors to these data is to extract novel information about galaxies; information which is often lost in more traditional analysis. In this study, we build a regression model for predicting a spectroscopic quantity, the specific star-formation rate (sSFR). As texture features we consider multi-scale gradient orientation histograms as well as multi-scale shape index histograms, which lead to a new descriptor. Our results show that we can successfully predict spectroscopic quantities from the texture in optical multi-band images. We successfully recover the observed bi-modal distribution of galaxies into quiescent and star-forming. The state-ofthe-art for predicting the sSFR is a color-based physical model. We significantly improve its accuracy by augmenting the model with texture information. This study is thefirst step towards enabling the quantification of physical galaxy properties from imaging data alone.</p><p>5 0.64908266 <a title="19-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-SUN3D%3A_A_Database_of_Big_Spaces_Reconstructed_Using_SfM_and_Object_Labels.html">367 iccv-2013-SUN3D: A Database of Big Spaces Reconstructed Using SfM and Object Labels</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxiong Xiao, Andrew Owens, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: Existing scene understanding datasets contain only a limited set of views of a place, and they lack representations of complete 3D spaces. In this paper, we introduce SUN3D, a large-scale RGB-D video database with camera pose and object labels, capturing the full 3D extent of many places. The tasks that go into constructing such a dataset are difficult in isolation hand-labeling videos is painstaking, and structure from motion (SfM) is unreliable for large spaces. But if we combine them together, we make the dataset construction task much easier. First, we introduce an intuitive labeling tool that uses a partial reconstruction to propagate labels from one frame to another. Then we use the object labels to fix errors in the reconstruction. For this, we introduce a generalization of bundle adjustment that incorporates object-to-object correspondences. This algorithm works by constraining points for the same object from different frames to lie inside a fixed-size bounding box, parameterized by its rotation and translation. The SUN3D database, the source code for the generalized bundle adjustment, and the web-based 3D annotation tool are all avail– able at http://sun3d.cs.princeton.edu.</p><p>6 0.64899969 <a title="19-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Elastic_Net_Constraints_for_Shape_Matching.html">140 iccv-2013-Elastic Net Constraints for Shape Matching</a></p>

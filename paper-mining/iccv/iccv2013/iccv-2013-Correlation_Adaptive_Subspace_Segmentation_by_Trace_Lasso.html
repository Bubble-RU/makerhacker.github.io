Given a set of data points drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to partition them into their underlying subspaces they were drawn from. The spectral clustering method is used as the framework.

A sparse affinity matrix tends to be block diagonal, with less connections between data points from different subspaces. The grouping effect ensures that the highly corrected data which are usually from the same subspace can be grouped together. Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), by using ?1-minimization, encourages sparsity for data selection, but it lacks of the grouping effect. On the contrary, Low-RankRepresentation (LRR), by rank minimization, and Least Squares Regression (LSR), by ?2-regularization, exhibit strong grouping effect, but they are short in subset selection. Thus the obtained affinity matrix is usually very sparse by SSC, yet very dense by LRR and LSR. In this work, we propose the Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation (CASS) method by using trace Lasso.

<p>Author: Ameet Talwalkar, Lester Mackey, Yadong Mu, Shih-Fu Chang, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Vision problems ranging from image clustering to motion segmentation to semi-supervised learning can naturally be framed as subspace segmentation problems, in which one aims to recover multiple low-dimensional subspaces from noisy and corrupted input data. Low-Rank Representation (LRR), a convex formulation of the subspace segmentation problem, is provably and empirically accurate on small problems but does not scale to the massive sizes of modern vision datasets. Moreover, past work aimed at scaling up low-rank matrix factorization is not applicable to LRR given its non-decomposable constraints. In this work, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for large-scale subspace segmentation that can cope with LRR ’s non-decomposable constraints and maintains LRR ’s strong recovery guarantees. This has immediate implications for the scalability of subspace segmentation, which we demonstrate on a benchmark face recognition dataset and in simulations. We then introduce novel applications of LRR-based subspace segmentation to large-scale semisupervised learning for multimedia event detection, concept detection, and image tagging. In each case, we obtain stateof-the-art results and order-of-magnitude speed ups.</p><p>3 0.28157094 <a title="93-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Space_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering.html">232 iccv-2013-Latent Space Sparse Subspace Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Vishal M. Patel, Hien Van Nguyen, René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm called Latent Space Sparse Subspace Clustering for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and clustering of data lying in a union of subspaces. Specifically, we describe a method that learns the projection of data and finds the sparse coefficients in the low-dimensional latent space. Cluster labels are then assigned by applying spectral clustering to a similarity matrix built from these sparse coefficients. An efficient optimization method is proposed and its non-linear extensions based on the kernel methods are presented. One of the main advantages of our method is that it is computationally efficient as the sparse coefficients are found in the low-dimensional latent space. Various experiments show that the proposed method performs better than the competitive state-of-theart subspace clustering methods.</p><p>4 0.23917812 <a title="93-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Subspace_Clustering_via_Half-Quadratic_Minimization.html">360 iccv-2013-Robust Subspace Clustering via Half-Quadratic Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yingya Zhang, Zhenan Sun, Ran He, Tieniu Tan</p><p>Abstract: Subspace clustering has important and wide applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. It is a challenging task to learn low-dimensional subspace structures due to the possible errors (e.g., noise and corruptions) existing in high-dimensional data. Recent subspace clustering methods usually assume a sparse representation of corrupted errors and correct the errors iteratively. However large corruptions in real-world applications can not be well addressed by these methods. A novel optimization model for robust subspace clustering is proposed in this paper. The objective function of our model mainly includes two parts. The first part aims to achieve a sparse representation of each high-dimensional data point with other data points. The second part aims to maximize the correntropy between a given data point and its low-dimensional representation with other points. Correntropy is a robust measure so that the influence of large corruptions on subspace clustering can be greatly suppressed. An extension of our method with explicit introduction of representation error terms into the model is also proposed. Half-quadratic minimization is provided as an efficient solution to the proposed robust subspace clustering formulations. Experimental results on Hopkins 155 dataset and Extended Yale Database B demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.</p><p>5 0.22113743 <a title="93-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Perspective_Motion_Segmentation_via_Collaborative_Clustering.html">314 iccv-2013-Perspective Motion Segmentation via Collaborative Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhuwen Li, Jiaming Guo, Loong-Fah Cheong, Steven Zhiying Zhou</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses real-world challenges in the motion segmentation problem, including perspective effects, missing data, and unknown number of motions. It first formulates the 3-D motion segmentation from two perspective views as a subspace clustering problem, utilizing the epipolar constraint of an image pair. It then combines the point correspondence information across multiple image frames via a collaborative clustering step, in which tight integration is achieved via a mixed norm optimization scheme. For model selection, wepropose an over-segment and merge approach, where the merging step is based on the property of the ?1-norm ofthe mutual sparse representation oftwo oversegmented groups. The resulting algorithm can deal with incomplete trajectories and perspective effects substantially better than state-of-the-art two-frame and multi-frame methods. Experiments on a 62-clip dataset show the significant superiority of the proposed idea in both segmentation accuracy and model selection.</p><p>6 0.18991223 <a title="93-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Correntropy_Induced_L2_Graph_for_Robust_Subspace_Clustering.html">94 iccv-2013-Correntropy Induced L2 Graph for Robust Subspace Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Georgios Tzimiropoulos, Maja Pantic</p><p>Abstract: We describe a very simple framework for deriving the most-well known optimization problems in Active Appearance Models (AAMs), and most importantly for providing efficient solutions. Our formulation results in two optimization problems for fast and exact AAM fitting, and one new algorithm which has the important advantage of being applicable to 3D. We show that the dominant cost for both forward and inverse algorithms is a few times mN which is the cost of projecting an image onto the appearance subspace. This makes both algorithms not only computationally realizable but also very attractive speed-wise for most current systems. Because exact AAM fitting is no longer computationally prohibitive, we trained AAMs in-the-wild with the goal of investigating whether AAMs benefit from such a training process. Our results show that although we did not use sophisticated shape priors, robust features or robust norms for improving performance, AAMs perform notably well and in some cases comparably with current state-ofthe-art methods. We provide Matlab source code for training, fitting and reproducing the results presented in this paper at ht tp ://ibug. . doc . i . a c . uk/resources. c</p><p>same-paper 3 0.67662424 <a title="93-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Correlation_Adaptive_Subspace_Segmentation_by_Trace_Lasso.html">93 iccv-2013-Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation by Trace Lasso</a></p>
<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jiashi Feng, Zhouchen Lin, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the subspace segmentation problem. Given a set of data points drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to partition them into their underlying subspaces they were drawn from. The spectral clustering method is used as the framework. It requires to find an affinity matrix which is close to block diagonal, with nonzero entries corresponding to the data point pairs from the same subspace. In this work, we argue that both sparsity and the grouping effect are important for subspace segmentation. A sparse affinity matrix tends to be block diagonal, with less connections between data points from different subspaces. The grouping effect ensures that the highly corrected data which are usually from the same subspace can be grouped together. Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), by using ?1-minimization, encourages sparsity for data selection, but it lacks of the grouping effect. On the contrary, Low-RankRepresentation (LRR), by rank minimization, and Least Squares Regression (LSR), by ?2-regularization, exhibit strong grouping effect, but they are short in subset selection. Thus the obtained affinity matrix is usually very sparse by SSC, yet very dense by LRR and LSR. In this work, we propose the Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation (CASS) method by using trace Lasso. CASS is a data correlation dependent method which simultaneously performs automatic data selection and groups correlated data together. It can be regarded as a method which adaptively balances SSC and LSR. Both theoretical and experimental results show the effectiveness of CASS.</p><p>4 0.62962544 <a title="93-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Curvature-Aware_Regularization_on_Riemannian_Submanifolds.html">100 iccv-2013-Curvature-Aware Regularization on Riemannian Submanifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Kwang In Kim, James Tompkin, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: One fundamental assumption in object recognition as well as in other computer vision and pattern recognition problems is that the data generation process lies on a manifold and that it respects the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. This assumption is held in several successful algorithms for diffusion and regularization, in particular, in graph-Laplacian-based algorithms. We claim that the performance of existing algorithms can be improved if we additionally account for how the manifold is embedded within the ambient space, i.e., if we consider the extrinsic geometry of the manifold. We present a procedure for characterizing the extrinsic (as well as intrinsic) curvature of a manifold M which is described by a sampled point cloud in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Once estimated, we use this characterization in general diffusion and regularization on M, and form a new regularizer on a point cloud. The resulting re-weighted graph Laplacian demonstrates superior performance over classical graph Laplacian in semisupervised learning and spectral clustering.</p><p>5 0.62520593 <a title="93-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Correntropy_Induced_L2_Graph_for_Robust_Subspace_Clustering.html">94 iccv-2013-Correntropy Induced L2 Graph for Robust Subspace Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jinhui Tang, Min Lin, Liang Lin, Shuicheng Yan, Zhouchen Lin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the robust subspace clustering problem, which aims to cluster the given possibly noisy data points into their underlying subspaces. A large pool of previous subspace clustering methods focus on the graph construction by different regularization of the representation coefficient. We instead focus on the robustness of the model to non-Gaussian noises. We propose a new robust clustering method by using the correntropy induced metric, which is robust for handling the non-Gaussian and impulsive noises. Also we further extend the method for handling the data with outlier rows/features. The multiplicative form of half-quadratic optimization is used to optimize the nonconvex correntropy objective function of the proposed models. Extensive experiments on face datasets well demonstrate that the proposed methods are more robust to corruptions and occlusions.</p><p>6 0.62211329 <a title="93-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Elastic_Net_Constraints_for_Shape_Matching.html">140 iccv-2013-Elastic Net Constraints for Shape Matching</a></p>

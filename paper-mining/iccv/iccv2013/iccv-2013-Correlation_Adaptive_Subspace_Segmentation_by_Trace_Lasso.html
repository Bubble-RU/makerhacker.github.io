</p><p>10 Introduction This paper focuses on subspace segmentation, the goal of which is to segment a given data set into clusters, ideally with each cluster corresponding to a subspace. [sent-21, score-0.227]
</p><p>11 cations, such as motion segmentation [19], face clustering [12], and image segmentation [9], owing to the fact that the real-world data often approximately lie in a mixture of subspaces. [sent-44, score-0.256]
</p><p>12 Assume that the data are drawn from a union of k subspaces of unknown dimensions reospf kec stuivbelsyp. [sent-46, score-0.162]
</p><p>13 Related work There has been a large body of research on subspace segmentation [23, 3, 13, 24, 17, 5, 8]. [sent-82, score-0.253]
</p><p>14 Most recently, the Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) [3, 4], Low-Rank Representation (LRR) [13, 12, 2], and Least Squares Regression (LSR) [16] techniques have been proposed for subspace segmentation and attracted much attention. [sent-83, score-0.253]
</p><p>15 These methods learn an affinity matrix whose entries measure the similarities among the data points and then perform spectral clustering on the affinity matrix to segment data. [sent-84, score-0.387]
</p><p>16 Ideal-  ly, the affinity matrix should be block diagonal (or block sparse in vector form), with nonzero entries corresponding to data point pairs from the same subspace. [sent-85, score-0.484]
</p><p>17 The constructed affinity matrix is usually not block diagonal even under certain strong assumptions, e. [sent-89, score-0.293]
</p><p>18 Then it uses the derived representation coefficients to measure the similarities between data points and constructs the affinity matrix. [sent-97, score-0.221]
</p><p>19 It is shown that, if the subspaces are independent, the sparse representation is block sparse. [sent-98, score-0.22]
</p><p>20 However, if the data from the same subspace 1A collection of k linear subspaces {Si }ik=1 are independent if and only if Si ? [sent-99, score-0.304]
</p><p>21 Thus SSC may result in a sparse affinity matrix but lead to unsatisfactory performance. [sent-106, score-0.195]
</p><p>22 Although LRR guarantees to produce a block diagonal solution when the data are noise free and drawn from independent subspaces, the real data are usually contaminated with noises or outliers. [sent-114, score-0.291]
</p><p>23 Below is the most recent work by using Least Squares Regression (LSR) [16] for subspace segmentation:  mWin ||X − XW||2F + λ||W||2F. [sent-120, score-0.176]
</p><p>24 In fact, for subspace segmentation, both sparsity and grouping effect are very important. [sent-122, score-0.334]
</p><p>25 Ideally, the affinity matrix should be sparse, with no connection between clusters. [sent-123, score-0.154]
</p><p>26 On the other hand, the affinity matrix should not be too sparse, i. [sent-124, score-0.154]
</p><p>27 , the nonzero connections within cluster should be sufficient enough for grouping correlated data in the same subspaces. [sent-126, score-0.276]
</p><p>28 Thus, it is expected that the model can automatically group the correlated data within cluster (like LRR and LSR) and eliminate the connections between clusters (like SSC). [sent-127, score-0.189]
</p><p>29 We take the adaptive advantage of trace Lasso to regularize the representation coefficient matrix, and define an affinity matrix by applying spectral clustering to the normalized Laplacian. [sent-135, score-0.462]
</p><p>30 For CASS, we can see that most large representation coefficients cluster on the data points from the same subspace as y. [sent-139, score-0.27]
</p><p>31 In comparison, the connections within cluster are very sparse by SSC, and the connections between clusters are very dense by LRR and LSR. [sent-140, score-0.165]
</p><p>32 Contributions We summarize the contributions of this paper as follows: •  •  •  We propose a new subspace segmentation method, cWaelle dpr otpheo sCeor are nleatwion s Adaptive Subspace Segmentation (CASS), by using trace Lasso [7]. [sent-143, score-0.443]
</p><p>33 CASS is the first method that takes the data correlation into account for subspace segmentation. [sent-144, score-0.255]
</p><p>34 We theoretically prove that trace Lasso has the grouping ethffeeocrte, i . [sent-148, score-0.288]
</p><p>35 ∗  A main difference between trace Lasso and the existing norms is that trace Lasso involves the data matrix X, which makes it adaptive to the correlation of data. [sent-156, score-0.533]
</p><p>36 1  If the data are highly correlated (the data points are all the same, X = x11T, XTX = 11T), trace Lasso is equal to the ? [sent-170, score-0.317]
</p><p>37 For other cases, trace Lasso interpolates between the ? [sent-172, score-0.228]
</p><p>38 We use trace Lasso for subset selection from all the data adaptively, which leads to the Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation (CASS) method. [sent-175, score-0.216]
</p><p>39 We first consider the subspace segmentation problem with clean data by CASS and then extend it to the noisy case. [sent-176, score-0.279]
</p><p>40 CASS with clean data Let X = [x1, · · · , xn] = [X1, · · · , Xk]Γ be a set of data drawn from ,k· subspaces {Si},ik=··1·, ,wXhere Xi denotes a ctoal ldercatwionn orofm ni d sautab points {fSrom} the i-th subspace Si, n = ni, and Γ is a hypothesized permutation matrix w? [sent-179, score-0.432]
</p><p>41 Different from the previous methods in SSC, LRR and LSR, CASS uses the trace Lasso as the objective function and solves the following problem:  ? [sent-184, score-0.209]
</p><p>42 (6)  The methods, SSC, LRR and LSR, show that if the da-  ta are sufficiently sampled from independent subspaces, a block diagonal solution can be achieved. [sent-188, score-0.157]
</p><p>43 The work [16] further shows that it is easy to get a block diagonal solution if the objective function satisfies the Enforced Block Diagonal (EBD) conditions. [sent-189, score-0.164]
</p><p>44 But the EBD conditions cannot be applied to trace Lasso directly, since trace Lasso is a function involving both the data X and w. [sent-190, score-0.44]
</p><p>45 Here we extend the EBD conditions [16] to the Enforced Block Sparse (EBS) conditions and show that the obtained solution is block sparse when the objective function satisfies the EBS conditions. [sent-191, score-0.229]
</p><p>46 Trace Lasso is a special case which satisfies the EBS conditions and thus leads to a block sparse solution. [sent-192, score-0.195]

</p><p>49 e EBS conditions greatly extend the family of the objective function which involves the block sparse property. [sent-237, score-0.17]

</p><p>52 ∗  ∗  In a similar way, CASS owns the block sparse property: Theorem 2 Let X = [x1, · · · , xn] = [X1, · · · , Xk]Γ ∈ Rd×n be a data matrix who,se·· c·o ,lxumn vectors, are s,uXffic]iΓen ∈tly drawn from a union of k independent subspaces {Si}ik=1, xj 0n, j m= a 1, ·i o· ·n , n. [sent-250, score-0.372]
</p><p>53 (8)  The block sparse property of CASS is the same as those of SSC, LRR and LSR when the data are from independent subspaces. [sent-266, score-0.18]
</p><p>54 This is also the motivation for using trace Lasso for subspace segmentation. [sent-267, score-0.366]
</p><p>55 For the noisy case, different from the previous methods, CASS may also lead to a solution which is close to block sparse, and it also has the grouping effect (see Section 2. [sent-268, score-0.224]

</p><p>58 Though the representation coefficient derived by SSC tends to be sparse, it is unable to group correlated data together. [sent-284, score-0.179]
</p><p>59 CASS by using trace Lasso takes the correlation of data into account which places a tradeoff between sparsity and grouping effect. [sent-286, score-0.396]
</p><p>60 We can see that the coefficient matrix derived by SSC is so sparse that it is even difficult to identify how many groups there are. [sent-292, score-0.167]
</p><p>61 Our proposed method CASS by using trace Lasso, achieves a more accurate coefficient matrix, which is close to be block diagonal, and it also groups data within cluster. [sent-299, score-0.369]
</p><p>62 Such intuition shows that CASS is more accurate to reveal the true data structure for subspace segmentation. [sent-300, score-0.202]
</p><p>63 In this work, we show that trace Lasso also has the  grouping effect for correlated data. [sent-307, score-0.378]
</p><p>64 The grouping effect of CASS may be weaker than LRR and LSR, since it Algorithm  1  Solving  Problem  (9)  by  ADM  Algorithm 1Solving Problem (9) by ADM Input: data matrix X, parameter λ. [sent-317, score-0.19]

</p><p>69 Experiments In this section, we apply CASS for subspace segmentation on three databases: the Hopkins 155 4 motion database, Extended Yale B database [6] and MNIST database 5 of handwritten digits. [sent-360, score-0.315]
</p><p>70 CASS is compared with SSC, LRR and LSR which are the representative and state-of-the-art methods for subspace segmentation. [sent-361, score-0.176]
</p><p>71 The derived affinity ma-  trices from all algorithms are also evaluated for the semisupervised learning task on the Extended Yale B database. [sent-362, score-0.152]
</p><p>72 The segmentation accuracy/error is used to evaluate the subspace segmentation performance. [sent-365, score-0.33]
</p><p>73 Each sequence is a sole data set and so there are 156 subspace segmentation problems in total. [sent-393, score-0.279]
</p><p>74 Extended Yale B is challenging for subspace segmentation due to large noises. [sent-396, score-0.253]
</p><p>75 We construct three subspace segmentation tasks based on the first 5, 8 and 10 subjects face images of this database. [sent-399, score-0.32]
</p><p>76 The data are first projected into a 5 6, 8 6, and 10 6-dimensional subspace by PjeCctAed, respectively. [sent-400, score-0.202]
</p><p>77 To further evaluate the effectiveness of CASS for other learning problems, we also use the derived affinity matrix for semi-supervised learning. [sent-402, score-0.187]
</p><p>78 Our goal is to predict the labels of the test data by Markov random walks [21] on the affinity matrices learnt by kNN, SSC, LRR, LSR and CASS. [sent-408, score-0.168]
</p><p>79 MNIST database of handwritten digits is also widely used in subspace learning and clustering [11]. [sent-411, score-0.259]
</p><p>80 Third, the correlation of data is strong as the dimension of each affine subspace is no more than three [3] [16], thus CASS tends to be close to LSR in this case. [sent-428, score-0.255]
</p><p>81 The affinity matrices derived by (a) SSC, (b) LRR, (c) LSR, and (d) CASS on the MNIST database. [sent-439, score-0.175]
</p><p>82 For these two clustering tasks, both LRR and LSR perform much better than SSC, which can be attributed to the strong grouping effect of the two methods. [sent-456, score-0.166]
</p><p>83 CASS not only preserves the grouping effect within cluster but  also enhances the sparsity between clusters. [sent-458, score-0.183]
</p><p>84 It confirms that CASS usually leads to an approximately block diagonal affinity matrix which results in a more accurate segmentation result. [sent-460, score-0.388]
</p><p>85 This example shows that the affinity matrix by trace Lasso is also effective for semi-supervised learning. [sent-467, score-0.344]
</p><p>86 The comparison of the derived affinity matrices by these four methods is illustrated in Figure 4. [sent-469, score-0.175]
</p><p>87 We can see that CASS obtains an affinity matrix which is close to block diagonal by preserving the 135 1  grouping effect. [sent-470, score-0.391]
</p><p>88 The main reason may lie in the fact that the handwritten digit data do not  fit the subspace structure well. [sent-474, score-0.232]
</p><p>89 This is also the main challenge for real-world applications by subspace segmentation. [sent-475, score-0.176]
</p><p>90 Conclusions and Future Work In this work, we propose the Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation (CASS) method by using the trace Lasso. [sent-477, score-0.19]
</p><p>91 The adaptive advantage of CASS comes from the mechanism of trace Lasso which balances between ? [sent-479, score-0.257]
</p><p>92 In theory, we show that CASS is able to reveal the true segmentation result when the subspaces are independent. [sent-482, score-0.161]

<p>Author: Vishal M. Patel, Hien Van Nguyen, René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm called Latent Space Sparse Subspace Clustering for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and clustering of data lying in a union of subspaces. Specifically, we describe a method that learns the projection of data and finds the sparse coefficients in the low-dimensional latent space. Cluster labels are then assigned by applying spectral clustering to a similarity matrix built from these sparse coefficients. An efficient optimization method is proposed and its non-linear extensions based on the kernel methods are presented. One of the main advantages of our method is that it is computationally efficient as the sparse coefficients are found in the low-dimensional latent space. Various experiments show that the proposed method performs better than the competitive state-of-theart subspace clustering methods.</p><p>3 0.31518185 <a title="93-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Distributed_Low-Rank_Subspace_Segmentation.html">122 iccv-2013-Distributed Low-Rank Subspace Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ameet Talwalkar, Lester Mackey, Yadong Mu, Shih-Fu Chang, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Vision problems ranging from image clustering to motion segmentation to semi-supervised learning can naturally be framed as subspace segmentation problems, in which one aims to recover multiple low-dimensional subspaces from noisy and corrupted input data. Low-Rank Representation (LRR), a convex formulation of the subspace segmentation problem, is provably and empirically accurate on small problems but does not scale to the massive sizes of modern vision datasets. Moreover, past work aimed at scaling up low-rank matrix factorization is not applicable to LRR given its non-decomposable constraints. In this work, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for large-scale subspace segmentation that can cope with LRR ’s non-decomposable constraints and maintains LRR ’s strong recovery guarantees.

<p>Author: Yingya Zhang, Zhenan Sun, Ran He, Tieniu Tan</p><p>Abstract: Subspace clustering has important and wide applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. It is a challenging task to learn low-dimensional subspace structures due to the possible errors (e.g., noise and corruptions) existing in high-dimensional data. Recent subspace clustering methods usually assume a sparse representation of corrupted errors and correct the errors iteratively. However large corruptions in real-world applications can not be well addressed by these methods. A novel optimization model for robust subspace clustering is proposed in this paper. The objective function of our model mainly includes two parts. The first part aims to achieve a sparse representation of each high-dimensional data point with other data points. The second part aims to maximize the correntropy between a given data point and its low-dimensional representation with other points. Correntropy is a robust measure so that the influence of large corruptions on subspace clustering can be greatly suppressed. An extension of our method with explicit introduction of representation error terms into the model is also proposed. Half-quadratic minimization is provided as an efficient solution to the proposed robust subspace clustering formulations. Experimental results on Hopkins 155 dataset and Extended Yale Database B demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.</p><p>5 0.23962815 <a title="93-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Correntropy_Induced_L2_Graph_for_Robust_Subspace_Clustering.html">94 iccv-2013-Correntropy Induced L2 Graph for Robust Subspace Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jiashi Feng, Zhouchen Lin, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the subspace segmentation problem. Given a set of data points drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to partition them into their underlying subspaces they were drawn from. The spectral clustering method is used as the framework. It requires to find an affinity matrix which is close to block diagonal, with nonzero entries corresponding to the data point pairs from the same subspace. In this work, we argue that both sparsity and the grouping effect are important for subspace segmentation. A sparse affinity matrix tends to be block diagonal, with less connections between data points from different subspaces. The grouping effect ensures that the highly corrected data which are usually from the same subspace can be grouped together. Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), by using ?1-minimization, encourages sparsity for data selection, but it lacks of the grouping effect. On the contrary, Low-RankRepresentation (LRR), by rank minimization, and Least Squares Regression (LSR), by ?2-regularization, exhibit strong grouping effect, but they are short in subset selection. Thus the obtained affinity matrix is usually very sparse by SSC, yet very dense by LRR and LSR. In this work, we propose the Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation (CASS) method by using trace Lasso. CASS is a data correlation dependent method which simultaneously performs automatic data selection and groups correlated data together. It can be regarded as a method which adaptively balances SSC and LSR. Both theoretical and experimental results show the effectiveness of CASS.</p><p>2 0.95169562 <a title="93-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Subspace_Clustering_via_Half-Quadratic_Minimization.html">360 iccv-2013-Robust Subspace Clustering via Half-Quadratic Minimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Vishal M. Patel, Hien Van Nguyen, René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm called Latent Space Sparse Subspace Clustering for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and clustering of data lying in a union of subspaces. Specifically, we describe a method that learns the projection of data and finds the sparse coefficients in the low-dimensional latent space. Cluster labels are then assigned by applying spectral clustering to a similarity matrix built from these sparse coefficients. An efficient optimization method is proposed and its non-linear extensions based on the kernel methods are presented. One of the main advantages of our method is that it is computationally efficient as the sparse coefficients are found in the low-dimensional latent space. Various experiments show that the proposed method performs better than the competitive state-of-theart subspace clustering methods.</p><p>4 0.85630471 <a title="93-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Distributed_Low-Rank_Subspace_Segmentation.html">122 iccv-2013-Distributed Low-Rank Subspace Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ameet Talwalkar, Lester Mackey, Yadong Mu, Shih-Fu Chang, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Vision problems ranging from image clustering to motion segmentation to semi-supervised learning can naturally be framed as subspace segmentation problems, in which one aims to recover multiple low-dimensional subspaces from noisy and corrupted input data. Low-Rank Representation (LRR), a convex formulation of the subspace segmentation problem, is provably and empirically accurate on small problems but does not scale to the massive sizes of modern vision datasets. Moreover, past work aimed at scaling up low-rank matrix factorization is not applicable to LRR given its non-decomposable constraints. In this work, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for large-scale subspace segmentation that can cope with LRR ’s non-decomposable constraints and maintains LRR ’s strong recovery guarantees. This has immediate implications for the scalability of subspace segmentation, which we demonstrate on a benchmark face recognition dataset and in simulations.

<p>Author: Hae-Gon Jeon, Joon-Young Lee, Yudeog Han, Seon Joo Kim, In So Kweon</p><p>Abstract: Finding a good binary sequence is critical in determining theperformance ofthe coded exposure imaging, butprevious methods mostly rely on a random search for finding the binary codes, which could easily fail to find good long sequences due to the exponentially growing search space. In this paper, we present a new computationally efficient algorithm for generating the binary sequence, which is especially well suited for longer sequences. We show that the concept of the low autocorrelation binary sequence that has been well exploited in the information theory community can be applied for generating the fluttering patterns of the shutter, propose a new measure of a good binary sequence, and present a new algorithm by modifying the Legendre sequence for the coded exposure imaging. Experiments using both synthetic and real data show that our new algorithm consistently generates better binary sequencesfor the coded exposure problem, yielding better deblurring and resolution enhancement results compared to the previous methods for generating the binary codes.</p><p>3 0.67699534 <a title="93-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_New_Adaptive_Segmental_Matching_Measure_for_Human_Activity_Recognition.html">22 iccv-2013-A New Adaptive Segmental Matching Measure for Human Activity Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Daozheng Chen, Dhruv Batra, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: Latent variables models have been applied to a number of computer vision problems. However, the complexity of the latent space is typically left as a free design choice. A larger latent space results in a more expressive model, but such models are prone to overfitting and are slower to perform inference with. The goal of this paper is to regularize the complexity of the latent space and learn which hidden states are really relevant for prediction. Specifically, we propose using group-sparsity-inducing regularizers such as ?1-?2 to estimate the parameters of Structured SVMs with unstructured latent variables. Our experiments on digit recognition and object detection show that our approach is indeed able to control the complexity of latent space without any significant loss in accuracy of the learnt model.</p><p>5 0.67216671 <a title="93-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Coupled_Dictionary_and_Feature_Space_Learning_with_Applications_to_Cross-Domain_Image_Synthesis_and_Recognition.html">96 iccv-2013-Coupled Dictionary and Feature Space Learning with Applications to Cross-Domain Image Synthesis and Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: De-An Huang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p><p>Abstract: Cross-domain image synthesis and recognition are typically considered as two distinct tasks in the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition. Therefore, it is not clear whether approaches addressing one task can be easily generalized or extended for solving the other. In this paper, we propose a unified model for coupled dictionary and feature space learning. The proposed learning model not only observes a common feature space for associating cross-domain image data for recognition purposes, the derived feature space is able to jointly update the dictionaries in each image domain for improved representation. This is why our method can be applied to both cross-domain image synthesis and recognition problems. Experiments on a variety of synthesis and recognition tasks such as single image super-resolution, cross-view action recognition, and sketchto-photo face recognition would verify the effectiveness of our proposed learning model.</p><p>6 0.66669786 <a title="93-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Implied_Feedback%3A_Learning_Nuances_of_User_Behavior_in_Image_Search.html">213 iccv-2013-Implied Feedback: Learning Nuances of User Behavior in Image Search</a></p>

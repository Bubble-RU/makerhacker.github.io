<p>Author: Guosheng Lin, Chunhua Shen, David Suter, Anton van_den_Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Most existing approaches to hashing apply a single form of hash function, and an optimization process which is typically deeply coupled to this specific form. This tight coupling restricts the flexibility of the method to respond to the data, and can result in complex optimization problems that are difficult to solve. Here we propose a flexible yet simple framework that is able to accommodate different types of loss functions and hash functions. This framework allows a number of existing approaches to hashing to be placed in context, and simplifies the development of new problemspecific hashing methods. Our framework decomposes the hashing learning problem into two steps: hash bit learning and hash function learning based on the learned bits. The first step can typically be formulated as binary quadratic problems, and the second step can be accomplished by training standard binary classifiers. Both problems have been extensively studied in the literature. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective, flexible and outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p><p>3 0.73411846 <a title="229-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Complementary_Projection_Hashing.html">83 iccv-2013-Complementary Projection Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongming Jin, Yao Hu, Yue Lin, Debing Zhang, Shiding Lin, Deng Cai, Xuelong Li</p><p>Abstract: Recently, hashing techniques have been widely applied to solve the approximate nearest neighbors search problem in many vision applications. Generally, these hashing approaches generate 2c buckets, where c is the length of the hash code. A good hashing method should satisfy the following two requirements: 1) mapping the nearby data points into the same bucket or nearby (measured by xue long l i opt . ac . cn @ a(a)b(b) the Hamming distance) buckets. 2) all the data points are evenly distributed among all the buckets. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Complementary Projection Hashing (CPH) to find the optimal hashing functions which explicitly considers the above two requirements. Specifically, CPHaims at sequentiallyfinding a series ofhyperplanes (hashing functions) which cross the sparse region of the data. At the same time, the data points are evenly distributed in the hypercubes generated by these hyperplanes. The experiments comparing with the state-of-the-art hashing methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p><p>4 0.6722526 <a title="229-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Hash_Codes_with_Listwise_Supervision.html">239 iccv-2013-Learning Hash Codes with Listwise Supervision</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Wang, Wei Liu, Andy X. Sun, Yu-Gang Jiang</p><p>Abstract: Hashing techniques have been intensively investigated in the design of highly efficient search engines for largescale computer vision applications. Compared with prior approximate nearest neighbor search approaches like treebased indexing, hashing-based search schemes have prominent advantages in terms of both storage and computational efficiencies. Moreover, the procedure of devising hash functions can be easily incorporated into sophisticated machine learning tools, leading to data-dependent and task-specific compact hash codes. Therefore, a number of learning paradigms, ranging from unsupervised to supervised, have been applied to compose appropriate hash functions. How- ever, most of the existing hash function learning methods either treat hash function design as a classification problem or generate binary codes to satisfy pairwise supervision, and have not yet directly optimized the search accuracy. In this paper, we propose to leverage listwise supervision into a principled hash function learning framework. In particular, the ranking information is represented by a set of rank triplets that can be used to assess the quality of ranking. Simple linear projection-based hash functions are solved efficiently through maximizing the ranking quality over the training data. We carry out experiments on large image datasets with size up to one million and compare with the state-of-the-art hashing techniques. The extensive results corroborate that our learned hash codes via listwise supervision can provide superior search accuracy without incurring heavy computational overhead.</p><p>5 0.56990856 <a title="229-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Supervised_Binary_Hash_Code_Learning_with_Jensen_Shannon_Divergence.html">409 iccv-2013-Supervised Binary Hash Code Learning with Jensen Shannon Divergence</a></p>

<p>Author: Engin Türetken, Carlos Becker, Przemyslaw Glowacki, Fethallah Benmansour, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to detecting irregular curvilinear structures in noisy image stacks. In contrast to earlier approaches that rely on circular models of the crosssections, ours allows for the arbitrarily-shaped ones that are prevalent in biological imagery. This is achieved by maximizing the image gradient flux along multiple directions and radii, instead of only two with a unique radius as is usually done. This yields a more complex optimization problem for which we propose a computationally efficient solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range ofchallenging gray scale and color datasets and show that it outperforms existing techniques, especially on very irregular structures.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.74566227 <a title="229-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Large-Scale_Video_Hashing_via_Structure_Learning.html">229 iccv-2013-Large-Scale Video Hashing via Structure Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Guangnan Ye, Dong Liu, Jun Wang, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Recently, learning based hashing methods have become popular for indexing large-scale media data. Hashing methods map high-dimensional features to compact binary codes that are efficient to match and robust in preserving original similarity. However, most of the existing hashing methods treat videos as a simple aggregation of independent frames and index each video through combining the indexes of frames. The structure information of videos, e.g., discriminative local visual commonality and temporal consistency, is often neglected in the design of hash functions. In this paper, we propose a supervised method that explores the structure learning techniques to design efficient hash functions. The proposed video hashing method formulates a minimization problem over a structure-regularized empirical loss. In particular, the structure regularization exploits the common local visual patterns occurring in video frames that are associated with the same semantic class, and simultaneously preserves the temporal consistency over successive frames from the same video. We show that the minimization objective can be efficiently solved by an Acceler- ated Proximal Gradient (APG) method. Extensive experiments on two large video benchmark datasets (up to around 150K video clips with over 12 million frames) show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-ofthe-art hashing methods.</p><p>3 0.7156291 <a title="229-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Guided_Depth_Upsampling_Using_Anisotropic_Total_Generalized_Variation.html">209 iccv-2013-Image Guided Depth Upsampling Using Anisotropic Total Generalized Variation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Ferstl, Christian Reinbacher, Rene Ranftl, Matthias Ruether, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present a novel method for the challenging problem of depth image upsampling. Modern depth cameras such as Kinect or Time of Flight cameras deliver dense, high quality depth measurements but are limited in their lateral resolution. To overcome this limitation we formulate a convex optimization problem using higher order regularization for depth image upsampling. In this optimization an anisotropic diffusion tensor, calculated from a high resolution intensity image, is used to guide the upsampling. We derive a numerical algorithm based on a primaldual formulation that is efficiently parallelized and runs at multiple frames per second. We show that this novel upsampling clearly outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of speed and accuracy on the widely used Middlebury 2007 datasets. Furthermore, we introduce novel datasets with highly accurate groundtruth, which, for the first time, enable to benchmark depth upsampling methods using real sensor data.</p><p>4 0.70992988 <a title="229-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_General_Two-Step_Approach_to_Learning-Based_Hashing.html">13 iccv-2013-A General Two-Step Approach to Learning-Based Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Guosheng Lin, Chunhua Shen, David Suter, Anton van_den_Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Most existing approaches to hashing apply a single form of hash function, and an optimization process which is typically deeply coupled to this specific form. This tight coupling restricts the flexibility of the method to respond to the data, and can result in complex optimization problems that are difficult to solve. Here we propose a flexible yet simple framework that is able to accommodate different types of loss functions and hash functions. This framework allows a number of existing approaches to hashing to be placed in context, and simplifies the development of new problemspecific hashing methods. Our framework decomposes the hashing learning problem into two steps: hash bit learning and hash function learning based on the learned bits. The first step can typically be formulated as binary quadratic problems, and the second step can be accomplished by training standard binary classifiers. Both problems have been extensively studied in the literature. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective, flexible and outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p><p>5 0.69634342 <a title="229-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Complementary_Projection_Hashing.html">83 iccv-2013-Complementary Projection Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongming Jin, Yao Hu, Yue Lin, Debing Zhang, Shiding Lin, Deng Cai, Xuelong Li</p><p>Abstract: Recently, hashing techniques have been widely applied to solve the approximate nearest neighbors search problem in many vision applications. Generally, these hashing approaches generate 2c buckets, where c is the length of the hash code. A good hashing method should satisfy the following two requirements: 1) mapping the nearby data points into the same bucket or nearby (measured by xue long l i opt . ac . cn @ a(a)b(b) the Hamming distance) buckets. 2) all the data points are evenly distributed among all the buckets. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Complementary Projection Hashing (CPH) to find the optimal hashing functions which explicitly considers the above two requirements. Specifically, CPHaims at sequentiallyfinding a series ofhyperplanes (hashing functions) which cross the sparse region of the data. At the same time, the data points are evenly distributed in the hypercubes generated by these hyperplanes. The experiments comparing with the state-of-the-art hashing methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p><p>6 0.69268191 <a title="229-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Hash_Codes_with_Listwise_Supervision.html">239 iccv-2013-Learning Hash Codes with Listwise Supervision</a></p>

<p>Author: Inchang Choi, Sunyeong Kim, Michael S. Brown, Yu-Wing Tai</p><p>Abstract: Single image matting techniques assume high-quality input images. The vast majority of images on the web and in personal photo collections are encoded using JPEG compression. JPEG images exhibit quantization artifacts that adversely affect the performance of matting algorithms. To address this situation, we propose a learning-based post-processing method to improve the alpha mattes extracted from JPEG images. Our approach learns a set of sparse dictionaries from training examples that are used to transfer details from high-quality alpha mattes to alpha mattes corrupted by JPEG compression. Three different dictionaries are defined to accommodate different object structure (long hair, short hair, and sharp boundaries). A back-projection criteria combined within an MRF framework is used to automatically select the best dictionary to apply on the objectâ€™s local boundary. We demonstrate that our method can produces superior results over existing state-of-the-art matting algorithms on a variety of inputs and compression levels.</p><p>3 0.18413091 <a title="275-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-On_the_Mean_Curvature_Flow_on_Graphs_with_Applications_in_Image_and_Manifold_Processing.html">296 iccv-2013-On the Mean Curvature Flow on Graphs with Applications in Image and Manifold Processing</a></p>
<p>Author: Abdallah El_Chakik, Abderrahim Elmoataz, Ahcene Sadi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptation and transcription of the mean curvature level set equation on a general discrete domain (weighted graphs with arbitrary topology). We introduce the perimeters on graph using difference operators and define the curvature as the first variation of these perimeters. Our proposed approach of mean curvature unifies both local and non local notions of mean curvature on Euclidean domains. Furthermore, it allows the extension to the processing of manifolds and data which can be represented by graphs.</p><p>4 0.14857855 <a title="275-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-The_Moving_Pose%3A_An_Efficient_3D_Kinematics_Descriptor_for_Low-Latency_Action_Recognition_and_Detection.html">417 iccv-2013-The Moving Pose: An Efficient 3D Kinematics Descriptor for Low-Latency Action Recognition and Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Mihai Zanfir, Marius Leordeanu, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Human action recognition under low observational latency is receiving a growing interest in computer vision due to rapidly developing technologies in human-robot interaction, computer gaming and surveillance. In this paper we propose a fast, simple, yet powerful non-parametric Moving Pose (MP)frameworkfor low-latency human action and activity recognition. Central to our methodology is a moving pose descriptor that considers both pose information as well as differential quantities (speed and acceleration) of the human body joints within a short time window around the current frame. The proposed descriptor is used in conjunction with a modified kNN classifier that considers both the temporal location of a particular frame within the action sequence as well as the discrimination power of its moving pose descriptor compared to other frames in the training set. The resulting method is non-parametric and enables low-latency recognition, one-shot learning, and action detection in difficult unsegmented sequences. Moreover, the framework is real-time, scalable, and outperforms more sophisticated approaches on challenging benchmarks like MSR-Action3D or MSR-DailyActivities3D.</p><p>5 0.12932417 <a title="275-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Object_Segmentation_in_Unconstrained_Video.html">160 iccv-2013-Fast Object Segmentation in Unconstrained Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Anestis Papazoglou, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: We present a technique for separating foreground objects from the background in a video. Our method isfast, , fully automatic, and makes minimal assumptions about the video. This enables handling essentially unconstrained settings, including rapidly moving background, arbitrary object motion and appearance, and non-rigid deformations and articulations. In experiments on two datasets containing over 1400 video shots, our method outperforms a state-of-theart background subtraction technique [4] as well as methods based on clustering point tracks [6, 18, 19]. Moreover, it performs comparably to recent video object segmentation methods based on objectproposals [14, 16, 27], while being orders of magnitude faster.</p><p>6 0.12218348 <a title="275-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Label_Propagation_for_Semi-supervised_Multi-class_Multi-label_Classification.html">126 iccv-2013-Dynamic Label Propagation for Semi-supervised Multi-class Multi-label Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephen Lombardi, Ko Nishino, Yasushi Makihara, Yasushi Yagi</p><p>Abstract: Human gait modeling (e.g., for person identification) largely relies on image-based representations that muddle gait with body shape. Silhouettes, for instance, inherently entangle body shape and gait. For gait analysis and recognition, decoupling these two factors is desirable. Most important, once decoupled, they can be combined for the task at hand, but not if left entangled in the first place. In this paper, we introduce Two-Point Gait, a gait representation that encodes the limb motions regardless of the body shape. Two-Point Gait is directly computed on the image sequence based on the two point statistics of optical flow fields. We demonstrate its use for exploring the space of human gait and gait recognition under large clothing variation. The results show that we can achieve state-of-the-art person recognition accuracy on a challenging dataset.</p><p>4 0.62334651 <a title="275-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Optical_Flow_via_Locally_Adaptive_Fusion_of_Complementary_Data_Costs.html">300 iccv-2013-Optical Flow via Locally Adaptive Fusion of Complementary Data Costs</a></p>
<p>Author: Tae Hyun Kim, Hee Seok Lee, Kyoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: Many state-of-the-art optical flow estimation algorithms optimize the data and regularization terms to solve ill-posed problems. In this paper, in contrast to the conventional optical flow framework that uses a single or fixed data model, we study a novel framework that employs locally varying data term that adaptively combines different multiple types of data models. The locally adaptive data term greatly reduces the matching ambiguity due to the complementary nature of the multiple data models. The optimal number of complementary data models is learnt by minimizing the redundancy among them under the minimum description length constraint (MDL). From these chosen data models, a new optical flow estimation energy model is designed with the weighted sum of the multiple data models, and a convex optimization-based highly effective and practical solution thatfinds the opticalflow, as well as the weights isproposed. Comparative experimental results on the Middlebury optical flow benchmark show that the proposed method using the complementary data models outperforms the state-ofthe art methods.</p><p>5 0.62041146 <a title="275-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Estimating_the_Material_Properties_of_Fabric_from_Video.html">145 iccv-2013-Estimating the Material Properties of Fabric from Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Katherine L. Bouman, Bei Xiao, Peter Battaglia, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: Passively estimating the intrinsic material properties of deformable objects moving in a natural environment is essential for scene understanding. We present a framework to automatically analyze videos of fabrics moving under various unknown wind forces, and recover two key material properties of the fabric: stiffness and area weight. We extend features previously developed to compactly represent static image textures to describe video textures, such as fabric motion. A discriminatively trained regression model is then used to predict the physical properties of fabric from these features. The success of our model is demonstrated on a new, publicly available database offabric videos with corresponding measured ground truth material properties. We show that our predictions are well correlated with ground truth measurements of stiffness and density for the fabrics. Our contributions include: (a) a database that can be used for training and testing algorithms for passively predicting fabric properties from video, (b) an algorithm for predicting the material properties of fabric from a video, and (c) a perceptual study of humansâ€™ ability to estimate the material properties of fabric from videos and images.</p><p>6 0.61118972 <a title="275-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Compensating_for_Motion_during_Direct-Global_Separation.html">82 iccv-2013-Compensating for Motion during Direct-Global Separation</a></p>

<p>Author: TomÃ¡Å¡ Kazmar, Evgeny Z. Kvon, Alexander Stark, Christoph H. Lampert</p><p>Abstract: In this work we propose a system for automatic classification of Drosophila embryos into developmental stages. While the system is designed to solve an actual problem in biological research, we believe that the principle underlying it is interesting not only for biologists, but also for researchers in computer vision. The main idea is to combine two orthogonal sources of information: one is a classifier trained on strongly invariant features, which makes it applicable to images of very different conditions, but also leads to rather noisy predictions. The other is a label propagation step based on a more powerful similarity measure that however is only consistent within specific subsets of the data at a time. In our biological setup, the information sources are the shape and the staining patterns of embryo images. We show experimentally that while neither of the methods can be used by itself to achieve satisfactory results, their combination achieves prediction quality comparable to human per- formance.</p><p>3 0.63816106 <a title="275-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Supervised_Binary_Hash_Code_Learning_with_Jensen_Shannon_Divergence.html">409 iccv-2013-Supervised Binary Hash Code Learning with Jensen Shannon Divergence</a></p>
<p>Author: Lixin Fan</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes to learn binary hash codes within a statistical learning framework, in which an upper bound of the probability of Bayes decision errors is derived for different forms of hash functions and a rigorous proof of the convergence of the upper bound is presented. Consequently, minimizing such an upper bound leads to consistent performance improvements of existing hash code learning algorithms, regardless of whether original algorithms are unsupervised or supervised. This paper also illustrates a fast hash coding method that exploits simple binary tests to achieve orders of magnitude improvement in coding speed as compared to projection based methods.</p><p>4 0.62784433 <a title="275-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_Learning-Based_Approach_to_Reduce_JPEG_Artifacts_in_Image_Matting.html">19 iccv-2013-A Learning-Based Approach to Reduce JPEG Artifacts in Image Matting</a></p>
<p>Author: Inchang Choi, Sunyeong Kim, Michael S. Brown, Yu-Wing Tai</p><p>Abstract: Single image matting techniques assume high-quality input images. The vast majority of images on the web and in personal photo collections are encoded using JPEG compression. JPEG images exhibit quantization artifacts that adversely affect the performance of matting algorithms. To address this situation, we propose a learning-based post-processing method to improve the alpha mattes extracted from JPEG images. Our approach learns a set of sparse dictionaries from training examples that are used to transfer details from high-quality alpha mattes to alpha mattes corrupted by JPEG compression. Three different dictionaries are defined to accommodate different object structure (long hair, short hair, and sharp boundaries). A back-projection criteria combined within an MRF framework is used to automatically select the best dictionary to apply on the objectâ€™s local boundary. We demonstrate that our method can produces superior results over existing state-of-the-art matting algorithms on a variety of inputs and compression levels.</p><p>5 0.62719971 <a title="275-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Feature_Weighting_via_Optimal_Thresholding_for_Video_Analysis.html">163 iccv-2013-Feature Weighting via Optimal Thresholding for Video Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongwen Xu, Yi Yang, Ivor Tsang, Nicu Sebe, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Fusion of multiple features can boost the performance of large-scale visual classification and detection tasks like TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection (MED) competition [1]. In this paper, we propose a novel feature fusion approach, namely Feature Weighting via Optimal Thresholding (FWOT) to effectively fuse various features. FWOT learns the weights, thresholding and smoothing parameters in a joint framework to combine the decision values obtained from all the individual features and the early fusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the weight and threshold factors of fusion problem simultaneously. Compared to state-of-the-art fusion algorithms, our approach achieves promising improvements on HMDB [8] action recognition dataset and CCV [5] video classification dataset. In addition, experiments on two TRECVID MED 2011 collections show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion methods for complex event detection.</p><p>6 0.61986595 <a title="275-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_and_Robust_Large-Scale_Rotation_Averaging.html">138 iccv-2013-Efficient and Robust Large-Scale Rotation Averaging</a></p>

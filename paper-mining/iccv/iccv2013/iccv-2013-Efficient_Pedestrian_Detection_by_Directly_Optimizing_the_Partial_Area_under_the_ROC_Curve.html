<p>Author: Markus Mathias, Rodrigo Benenson, Radu Timofte, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Detecting partially occluded pedestrians is challenging. A common practice to maximize detection quality is to train a set of occlusion-specific classifiers, each for a certain amount and type of occlusion. Since training classifiers is expensive, only a handful are typically trained. We show that by using many occlusion-specific classifiers, we outperform previous approaches on three pedestrian datasets; INRIA, ETH, and Caltech USA. We present a new approach to train such classifiers. By reusing computations among different training stages, 16 occlusion-specific classifiers can be trained at only one tenth the cost of one full training. We show that also test time cost grows sub-linearly.</p><p>3 0.1249292 <a title="136-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-stage_Contextual_Deep_Learning_for_Pedestrian_Detection.html">279 iccv-2013-Multi-stage Contextual Deep Learning for Pedestrian Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xingyu Zeng, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Cascaded classifiers1 have been widely used in pedestrian detection and achieved great success. These classifiers are trained sequentially without joint optimization. In this paper, we propose a new deep model that can jointly train multi-stage classifiers through several stages of backpropagation. It keeps the score map output by a classifier within a local region and uses it as contextual information to support the decision at the next stage. Through a specific design of the training strategy, this deep architecture is able to simulate the cascaded classifiers by mining hard samples to train the network stage-by-stage. Each classifier handles samples at a different difficulty level. Unsupervised pre-training and specifically designed stage-wise supervised training are used to regularize the optimization problem. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the training strategy helps to avoid overfitting. Experimental results on three datasets (Caltech, ETH and TUD-Brussels) show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.</p><p>4 0.11777735 <a title="136-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Forests_of_Local_Experts_for_Pedestrian_Detection.html">336 iccv-2013-Random Forests of Local Experts for Pedestrian Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Javier Marín, David Vázquez, Antonio M. López, Jaume Amores, Bastian Leibe</p><p>Abstract: Pedestrian detection is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, and has received a lot of attention in the last years. Recently, some authors have shown the advantages of using combinations of part/patch-based detectors in order to cope with the large variability of poses and the existence of partial occlusions. In this paper, we propose a pedestrian detection method that efficiently combines multiple local experts by means of a Random Forest ensemble. The proposed method works with rich block-based representations such as HOG and LBP, in such a way that the same features are reused by the multiple local experts, so that no extra computational cost is needed with respect to a holistic method. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to integrate the proposed approach with a cascaded architecture in order to achieve not only high accuracy but also an acceptable efficiency. In particular, the resulting detector operates at five frames per second using a laptop machine. We tested the proposed method with well-known challenging datasets such as Caltech, ETH, Daimler, and INRIA. The method proposed in this work consistently ranks among the top performers in all the datasets, being either the best method or having a small difference with the best one.</p><p>5 0.10142218 <a title="136-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Randomized_Ensemble_Tracking.html">338 iccv-2013-Randomized Ensemble Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Qinxun Bai, Zheng Wu, Stan Sclaroff, Margrit Betke, Camille Monnier</p><p>Abstract: We propose a randomized ensemble algorithm to model the time-varying appearance of an object for visual tracking. In contrast with previous online methods for updating classifier ensembles in tracking-by-detection, the weight vector that combines weak classifiers is treated as a random variable and the posterior distribution for the weight vector is estimated in a Bayesian manner. In essence, the weight vector is treated as a distribution that reflects the confidence among the weak classifiers used to construct and adapt the classifier ensemble. The resulting formulation models the time-varying discriminative ability among weak classifiers so that the ensembled strong classifier can adapt to the varying appearance, backgrounds, and occlusions. The formulation is tested in a tracking-by-detection implementation. Experiments on 28 challenging benchmark videos demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve results comparable to and often better than those of stateof-the-art approaches.</p><p>6 0.099465378 <a title="136-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Deep_Learning_for_Pedestrian_Detection.html">220 iccv-2013-Joint Deep Learning for Pedestrian Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Tianfu Wu, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Many object detectors, such as AdaBoost, SVM and deformable part-based models (DPM), compute additive scoring functions at a large number of windows scanned over image pyramid, thus computational efficiency is an important consideration beside accuracy performance. In this paper, we present a framework of learning cost-sensitive decision policy which is a sequence of two-sided thresholds to execute early rejection or early acceptance based on the accumulative scores at each step. A decision policy is said to be optimal if it minimizes an empirical global risk function that sums over the loss of false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP), and the cost of computation. While the risk function is very complex due to high-order connections among the two-sided thresholds, we find its upper bound can be optimized by dynamic programming (DP) efficiently and thus say the learned policy is near-optimal. Given the loss of FN and FP and the cost in three numbers, our method can produce a policy on-the-fly for Adaboost, SVM and DPM. In experiments, we show that our decision policy outperforms state-of-the-art cascade methods significantly in terms of speed with similar accuracy performance.</p><p>3 0.80574381 <a title="136-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-stage_Contextual_Deep_Learning_for_Pedestrian_Detection.html">279 iccv-2013-Multi-stage Contextual Deep Learning for Pedestrian Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: João F. Henriques, João Carreira, Rui Caseiro, Jorge Batista</p><p>Abstract: Competitive sliding window detectors require vast training sets. Since a pool of natural images provides a nearly endless supply of negative samples, in the form of patches at different scales and locations, training with all the available data is considered impractical. A staple of current approaches is hard negative mining, a method of selecting relevant samples, which is nevertheless expensive. Given that samples at slightly different locations have overlapping support, there seems to be an enormous amount of duplicated work. It is natural, then, to ask whether these redundancies can be eliminated. In this paper, we show that the Gram matrix describing such data is block-circulant. We derive a transformation based on the Fourier transform that block-diagonalizes the Gram matrix, at once eliminating redundancies and partitioning the learning problem. This decomposition is valid for any dense features and several learning algorithms, and takes full advantage of modern parallel architectures. Surprisingly, it allows training with all the potential samples in sets of thousands of images. By considering the full set, we generate in a single shot the optimal solution, which is usually obtained only after several rounds of hard negative mining. We report speed gains on Caltech Pedestrians and INRIA Pedestrians of over an order of magnitude, allowing training on a desktop computer in a couple of minutes.</p><p>6 0.70354837 <a title="136-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Training_Deformable_Part_Models_with_Decorrelated_Features.html">426 iccv-2013-Training Deformable Part Models with Decorrelated Features</a></p>

In this situation the performance of a detector should be assessed on the basis of the area under the ROC curve over that range, rather than over the full curve, as the performance outside the range is irrelevant. This measure is labelled as the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC). Effective cascade-based classification, for example, depends on training node classifiers that achieve the maximal detection rate at a moderate false positive rate, e.g., around 40% to 50%. We propose a novel ensemble learning method which achieves a maximal detection rate at a user-defined range of false positive rates by directly optimizing the partial AUC using structured learning. By optimizing for different ranges of false positive rates, the proposed method can be used to train either a single strong classifier or a node classifier forming part of a cascade classifier. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors using the pro- posed structured ensemble learning method.</p><p>2 0.62328202 <a title="136-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Partial_Sum_Minimization_of_Singular_Values_in_RPCA_for_Low-Level_Vision.html">310 iccv-2013-Partial Sum Minimization of Singular Values in RPCA for Low-Level Vision</a></p>
<p>Author: Tae-Hyun Oh, Hyeongwoo Kim, Yu-Wing Tai, Jean-Charles Bazin, In So Kweon</p><p>Abstract: Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) via rank minimization is a powerful tool for recovering underlying low-rank structure of clean data corrupted with sparse noise/outliers. In many low-level vision problems, not only it is known that the underlying structure of clean data is low-rank, but the exact rank of clean data is also known. Yet, when applying conventional rank minimization for those problems, the objective function is formulated in a way that does not fully utilize a priori target rank information about the problems. This observation motivates us to investigate whether there is a better alternative solution when using rank minimization. In this paper, instead of minimizing the nuclear norm, we propose to minimize the partial sum of singular values. The proposed objective function implicitly encourages the target rank constraint in rank minimization. Our experimental analyses show that our approach performs better than conventional rank minimization when the number of samples is deficient, while the solutions obtained by the two approaches are almost identical when the number of samples is more than sufficient. We apply our approach to various low-level vision problems, e.g. high dynamic range imaging, photometric stereo and image alignment, and show that our results outperform those obtained by the conventional nuclear norm rank minimization method.</p><p>3 0.59534419 <a title="136-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Handling_Occlusions_with_Franken-Classifiers.html">190 iccv-2013-Handling Occlusions with Franken-Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Markus Mathias, Rodrigo Benenson, Radu Timofte, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Detecting partially occluded pedestrians is challenging. A common practice to maximize detection quality is to train a set of occlusion-specific classifiers, each for a certain amount and type of occlusion. Since training classifiers is expensive, only a handful are typically trained. We show that by using many occlusion-specific classifiers, we outperform previous approaches on three pedestrian datasets; INRIA, ETH, and Caltech USA. We present a new approach to train such classifiers. By reusing computations among different training stages, 16 occlusion-specific classifiers can be trained at only one tenth the cost of one full training. We show that also test time cost grows sub-linearly.</p><p>4 0.58385688 <a title="136-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Quantize_and_Conquer%3A_A_Dimensionality-Recursive_Solution_to_Clustering%2C_Vector_Quantization%2C_and_Image_Retrieval.html">333 iccv-2013-Quantize and Conquer: A Dimensionality-Recursive Solution to Clustering, Vector Quantization, and Image Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Yannis Avrithis</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by the close relation between nearest neighbor search and clustering in high-dimensional spaces as well as the success of one helping to solve the other, we introduce a new paradigm where both problems are solved simultaneously. Our solution is recursive, not in the size of input data but in the number of dimensions. One result is a clustering algorithm that is tuned to small codebooks but does not need all data in memory at the same time and is practically constant in the data size. As a by-product, a tree structure performs either exact or approximate quantization on trained centroids, the latter being not very precise but extremely fast. A lesser contribution is a new indexing scheme for image retrieval that exploits multiple small codebooks to provide an arbitrarily fine partition of the descriptor space. Large scale experiments on public datasets exhibit state of the art performance and remarkable generalization.</p><p>5 0.58076084 <a title="136-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-STAR3D%3A_Simultaneous_Tracking_and_Reconstruction_of_3D_Objects_Using_RGB-D_Data.html">366 iccv-2013-STAR3D: Simultaneous Tracking and Reconstruction of 3D Objects Using RGB-D Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Yuheng Ren, Victor Prisacariu, David Murray, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a probabilistic framework for simultaneous tracking and reconstruction of 3D rigid objects using an RGB-D camera. The tracking problem is handled using a bag-of-pixels representation and a back-projection scheme. Surface and background appearance models are learned online, leading to robust tracking in the presence of heavy occlusion and outliers. In both our tracking and reconstruction modules, the 3D object is implicitly embedded using a 3D level-set function. The framework is initialized with a simple shape primitive model (e.g. a sphere or a cube), and the real 3D object shape is tracked and reconstructed online. Unlike existing depth-based 3D reconstruction works, which either rely on calibrated/fixed camera set up or use the observed world map to track the depth camera, our framework can simultaneously track and reconstruct small moving objects. We use both qualitative and quantitative results to demonstrate the superior performance of both tracking and reconstruction of our method.</p><p>6 0.5806908 <a title="136-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Live_Metric_3D_Reconstruction_on_Mobile_Phones.html">254 iccv-2013-Live Metric 3D Reconstruction on Mobile Phones</a></p>

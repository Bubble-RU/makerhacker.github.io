<p>Author: Bastien Jacquet, Christian Häne, Kevin Köser, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Although specular objects have gained interest in recent years, virtually no approaches exist for markerless reconstruction of reflective scenes in the wild. In this work, we present a practical approach to capturing normal maps in real-world scenes using video only. We focus on nearly planar surfaces such as windows, facades from glass or metal, or frames, screens and other indoor objects and show how normal maps of these can be obtained without the use of an artificial calibration object. Rather, we track the reflections of real-world straight lines, while moving with a hand-held or vehicle-mounted camera in front of the object. In contrast to error-prone local edge tracking, we obtain the reflections by a robust, global segmentation technique of an ortho-rectified 3D video cube that also naturally allows efficient user interaction. Then, at each point of the reflective surface, the resulting 2D-curve to 3D-line correspondence provides a novel quadratic constraint on the local surface normal. This allows to globally solve for the shape by integrability and smoothness constraints and easily supports the usage of multiple lines. We demonstrate the technique on several objects and facades.</p><p>3 0.097587563 <a title="148-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-How_Related_Exemplars_Help_Complex_Event_Detection_in_Web_Videos%3F.html">203 iccv-2013-How Related Exemplars Help Complex Event Detection in Web Videos?</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Yang, Zhigang Ma, Zhongwen Xu, Shuicheng Yan, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Compared to visual concepts such as actions, scenes and objects, complex event is a higher level abstraction of longer video sequences. For example, a “marriage proposal” event is described by multiple objects (e.g., ring, faces), scenes (e.g., in a restaurant, outdoor) and actions (e.g., kneeling down). The positive exemplars which exactly convey the precise semantic of an event are hard to obtain. It would be beneficial to utilize the related exemplars for complex event detection. However, the semantic correlations between related exemplars and the target event vary substantially as relatedness assessment is subjective. Two related exemplars can be about completely different events, e.g., in the TRECVID MED dataset, both bicycle riding and equestrianism are labeled as related to “attempting a bike trick” event. To tackle the subjectiveness of human assessment, our algorithm automatically evaluates how positive the related exemplars are for the detection of an event and uses them on an exemplar-specific basis. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is able to utilize related exemplars adaptively, and the algorithm gains good perform- z. ance for complex event detection.</p><p>4 0.095598198 <a title="148-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Detecting_Dynamic_Objects_with_Multi-view_Background_Subtraction.html">111 iccv-2013-Detecting Dynamic Objects with Multi-view Background Subtraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Raúl Díaz, Sam Hallman, Charless C. Fowlkes</p><p>Abstract: The confluence of robust algorithms for structure from motion along with high-coverage mapping and imaging of the world around us suggests that it will soon be feasible to accurately estimate camera pose for a large class photographs taken in outdoor, urban environments. In this paper, we investigate how such information can be used to improve the detection of dynamic objects such as pedestrians and cars. First, we show that when rough camera location is known, we can utilize detectors that have been trained with a scene-specific background model in order to improve detection accuracy. Second, when precise camera pose is available, dense matching to a database of existing images using multi-view stereo provides a way to eliminate static backgrounds such as building facades, akin to background-subtraction often used in video analysis. We evaluate these ideas using a dataset of tourist photos with estimated camera pose. For template-based pedestrian detection, we achieve a 50 percent boost in average precision over baseline.</p><p>5 0.092987664 <a title="148-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Manifold_Based_Face_Synthesis_from_Sparse_Samples.html">259 iccv-2013-Manifold Based Face Synthesis from Sparse Samples</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongteng Xu, Hongyuan Zha</p><p>Abstract: Data sparsity has been a thorny issuefor manifold-based image synthesis, and in this paper we address this critical problem by leveraging ideas from transfer learning. Specifically, we propose methods based on generating auxiliary data in the form of synthetic samples using transformations of the original sparse samples. To incorporate the auxiliary data, we propose a weighted data synthesis method, which adaptively selects from the generated samples for inclusion during the manifold learning process via a weighted iterative algorithm. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we apply it to the problem of face image synthesis from sparse samples. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method shows encouraging results with good performance improvements.</p><p>6 0.083849691 <a title="148-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Exemplar_Cut.html">150 iccv-2013-Exemplar Cut</a></p>

<p>Author: Jian-Fang Hu, Wei-Shi Zheng, Jianhuang Lai, Shaogang Gong, Tao Xiang</p><p>Abstract: Human action can be recognised from a single still image by modelling Human-object interaction (HOI), which infers the mutual spatial structure information between human and object as well as their appearance. Existing approaches rely heavily on accurate detection of human and object, and estimation of human pose. They are thus sensitive to large variations of human poses, occlusion and unsatisfactory detection of small size objects. To overcome this limitation, a novel exemplar based approach is proposed in this work. Our approach learns a set of spatial pose-object interaction exemplars, which are density functions describing how a person is interacting with a manipulated object for different activities spatially in a probabilistic way. A representation based on our HOI exemplar thus has great potential for being robust to the errors in human/object detection and pose estimation. A new framework consists of a proposed exemplar based HOI descriptor and an activity specific matching model that learns the parameters is formulated for robust human activity recog- nition. Experiments on two benchmark activity datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach obtains state-ofthe-art performance.</p><p>4 0.46504804 <a title="148-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Exemplar_Cut.html">150 iccv-2013-Exemplar Cut</a></p>
<p>Author: Jimei Yang, Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: We present a hybrid parametric and nonparametric algorithm, exemplar cut, for generating class-specific object segmentation hypotheses. For the parametric part, we train a pylon model on a hierarchical region tree as the energy function for segmentation. For the nonparametric part, we match the input image with each exemplar by using regions to obtain a score which augments the energy function from the pylon model. Our method thus generates a set of highly plausible segmentation hypotheses by solving a series of exemplar augmented graph cuts. Experimental results on the Graz and PASCAL datasets show that the proposed algorithm achievesfavorable segmentationperformance against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and accuracy.</p><p>5 0.46335188 <a title="148-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Real-World_Normal_Map_Capture_for_Nearly_Flat_Reflective_Surfaces.html">343 iccv-2013-Real-World Normal Map Capture for Nearly Flat Reflective Surfaces</a></p>

<p>Author: Yanchao Yang, Ganesh Sundaramoorthi</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to track the precise shape of a dynamic object in video. Joint dynamic shape and appearance models, in which a template of the object is propagated to match the object shape and radiance in the next frame, are advantageous over methods employing global image statistics in cases of complex object radiance and cluttered background. In cases of complex 3D object motion and relative viewpoint change, self-occlusions and disocclusions of the object are prominent, and current methods employing joint shape and appearance models are unable to accurately adapt to new shape and appearance information, leading to inaccurate shape detection. In this work, we model self-occlusions and dis-occlusions in a joint shape and appearance tracking framework. Experiments on video exhibiting occlusion/dis-occlusion, complex radiance and background show that occlusion/dis-occlusion modeling leads to superior shape accuracy compared to recent methods employing joint shape/appearance models or employing global statistics.</p><p>3 0.63380969 <a title="148-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Content-Aware_Rotation.html">90 iccv-2013-Content-Aware Rotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kaiming He, Huiwen Chang, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: We present an image editing tool called Content-Aware Rotation. Casually shot photos can appear tilted, and are often corrected by rotation and cropping. This trivial solution may remove desired content and hurt image integrity. Instead of doing rigid rotation, we propose a warping method that creates the perception of rotation and avoids cropping. Human vision studies suggest that the perception of rotation is mainly due to horizontal/vertical lines. We design an optimization-based method that preserves the rotation of horizontal/vertical lines, maintains the completeness of the image content, and reduces the warping distortion. An efficient algorithm is developed to address the challenging optimization. We demonstrate our content-aware rotation method on a variety of practical cases.</p><p>4 0.6073184 <a title="148-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-On_One-Shot_Similarity_Kernels%3A_Explicit_Feature_Maps_and_Properties.html">295 iccv-2013-On One-Shot Similarity Kernels: Explicit Feature Maps and Properties</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefanos Zafeiriou, Irene Kotsia</p><p>Abstract: Kernels have been a common tool of machine learning and computer vision applications for modeling nonlinearities and/or the design of robust1 similarity measures between objects. Arguably, the class of positive semidefinite (psd) kernels, widely known as Mercer’s Kernels, constitutes one of the most well-studied cases. For every psd kernel there exists an associated feature map to an arbitrary dimensional Hilbert space H, the so-called feature space. Tdihme mnsaiionn reason ebreth sipnadc ep s Hd ,ke threne slos’-c c aplolpedul aferiattyu rise the fact that classification/regression techniques (such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs)) and component analysis algorithms (such as Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)) can be devised in H, without an explicit defisnisiti (oKnP of t)h)e c feature map, only by using athne xkperlniceitl (dtehfeso-called kernel trick). Recently, due to the development of very efficient solutions for large scale linear SVMs and for incremental linear component analysis, the research to- wards finding feature map approximations for classes of kernels has attracted significant interest. In this paper, we attempt the derivation of explicit feature maps of a recently proposed class of kernels, the so-called one-shot similarity kernels. We show that for this class of kernels either there exists an explicit representation in feature space or the kernel can be expressed in such a form that allows for exact incremental learning. We theoretically explore the properties of these kernels and show how these kernels can be used for the development of robust visual tracking, recognition and deformable fitting algorithms. 1Robustness may refer to either the presence of outliers and noise the robustness to a class of transformations (e.g., translation). or to ∗ Irene Kotsia ,†,? ∗Electronics Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Patras, Greece ?School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London i .kot s i @mdx . ac .uk a</p><p>5 0.58805549 <a title="148-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Quadruplet-Wise_Image_Similarity_Learning.html">332 iccv-2013-Quadruplet-Wise Image Similarity Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc T. Law, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel similarity learning framework. Working with inequality constraints involving quadruplets of images, our approach aims at efficiently modeling similarity from rich or complex semantic label relationships. From these quadruplet-wise constraints, we propose a similarity learning framework relying on a convex optimization scheme. We then study how our metric learning scheme can exploit specific class relationships, such as class ranking (relative attributes), and class taxonomy. We show that classification using the learned metrics gets improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on several datasets. We also evaluate our approach in a new application to learn similarities between webpage screenshots in a fully unsupervised way.</p><p>6 0.56092477 <a title="148-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Motion_for_Every_Visible_Point.html">441 iccv-2013-Video Motion for Every Visible Point</a></p>

<p>Author: Daozheng Chen, Dhruv Batra, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: Latent variables models have been applied to a number of computer vision problems. However, the complexity of the latent space is typically left as a free design choice. A larger latent space results in a more expressive model, but such models are prone to overfitting and are slower to perform inference with. The goal of this paper is to regularize the complexity of the latent space and learn which hidden states are really relevant for prediction. Specifically, we propose using group-sparsity-inducing regularizers such as ?1-?2 to estimate the parameters of Structured SVMs with unstructured latent variables. Our experiments on digit recognition and object detection show that our approach is indeed able to control the complexity of latent space without any significant loss in accuracy of the learnt model.</p><p>3 0.12391653 <a title="130-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Predicting_Sufficient_Annotation_Strength_for_Interactive_Foreground_Segmentation.html">326 iccv-2013-Predicting Sufficient Annotation Strength for Interactive Foreground Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Suyog Dutt Jain, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: The mode of manual annotation used in an interactive segmentation algorithm affects both its accuracy and easeof-use. For example, bounding boxes are fast to supply, yet may be too coarse to get good results on difficult images; freehand outlines are slower to supply and more specific, yet they may be overkill for simple images. Whereas existing methods assume a fixed form of input no matter the image, we propose to predict the tradeoff between accuracy and effort. Our approach learns whether a graph cuts segmentation will succeed if initialized with a given annotation mode, based on the image ’s visual separability and foreground uncertainty. Using these predictions, we optimize the mode of input requested on new images a user wants segmented. Whether given a single image that should be segmented as quickly as possible, or a batch of images that must be segmented within a specified time budget, we show how to select the easiest modality that will be sufficiently strong to yield high quality segmentations. Extensive results with real users and three datasets demonstrate the impact.</p><p>4 0.12334517 <a title="130-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Breaking_the_Chain%3A_Liberation_from_the_Temporal_Markov_Assumption_for_Tracking_Human_Poses.html">65 iccv-2013-Breaking the Chain: Liberation from the Temporal Markov Assumption for Tracking Human Poses</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Tokola, Wongun Choi, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to multi-target tracking that has expressive potential beyond the capabilities of chainshaped hidden Markov models, yet has significantly reduced complexity. Our framework, which we call tracking-byselection, is similar to tracking-by-detection in that it separates the tasks of detection and tracking, but it shifts tempo-labs . com Stanford, CA ssi lvio @ st an ford . edu ral reasoning from the tracking stage to the detection stage. The core feature of tracking-by-selection is that it reasons about path hypotheses that traverse the entire video instead of a chain of single-frame object hypotheses. A traditional chain-shaped tracking-by-detection model is only able to promote consistency between one frame and the next. In tracking-by-selection, path hypotheses exist across time, and encouraging long-term temporal consistency is as simple as rewarding path hypotheses with consistent image features. One additional advantage of tracking-by-selection is that it results in a dramatically simplified model that can be solved exactly. We adapt an existing tracking-by-detection model to the tracking-by-selectionframework, and show improvedperformance on a challenging dataset (introduced in [18]).</p><p>5 0.093609214 <a title="130-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Structured_Forests_for_Fast_Edge_Detection.html">404 iccv-2013-Structured Forests for Fast Edge Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Piotr Dollár, C. Lawrence Zitnick</p><p>Abstract: Edge detection is a critical component of many vision systems, including object detectors and image segmentation algorithms. Patches of edges exhibit well-known forms of local structure, such as straight lines or T-junctions. In this paper we take advantage of the structure present in local image patches to learn both an accurate and computationally efficient edge detector. We formulate the problem of predicting local edge masks in a structured learning framework applied to random decision forests. Our novel approach to learning decision trees robustly maps the structured labels to a discrete space on which standard information gain measures may be evaluated. The result is an approach that obtains realtime performance that is orders of magnitude faster than many competing state-of-the-art approaches, while also achieving state-of-the-art edge detection results on the BSDS500 Segmentation dataset and NYU Depth dataset. Finally, we show the potential of our approach as a general purpose edge detector by showing our learned edge models generalize well across datasets.</p><p>6 0.093366027 <a title="130-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Strong_Appearance_and_Expressive_Spatial_Models_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">403 iccv-2013-Strong Appearance and Expressive Spatial Models for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Evgeny Levinkov, Mario Fritz</p><p>Abstract: Semantic road labeling is a key component of systems that aim at assisted or even autonomous driving. Considering that such systems continuously operate in the realworld, unforeseen conditions not represented in any conceivable training procedure are likely to occur on a regular basis. In order to equip systems with the ability to cope with such situations, we would like to enable adaptation to such new situations and conditions at runtime. Existing adaptive methods for image labeling either require labeled data from the new condition or even operate globally on a complete test set. None of this is a desirable mode of operation for a system as described above where new images arrive sequentially and conditions may vary. We study the effect of changing test conditions on scene labeling methods based on a new diverse street scene dataset. We propose a novel approach that can operate in such conditions and is based on a sequential Bayesian model update in order to robustly integrate the arriving images into the adapting procedure.</p><p>3 0.64876723 <a title="130-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Convex_Optimization_Framework_for_Active_Learning.html">6 iccv-2013-A Convex Optimization Framework for Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ehsan Elhamifar, Guillermo Sapiro, Allen Yang, S. Shankar Sasrty</p><p>Abstract: In many image/video/web classification problems, we have access to a large number of unlabeled samples. However, it is typically expensive and time consuming to obtain labels for the samples. Active learning is the problem of progressively selecting and annotating the most informative unlabeled samples, in order to obtain a high classification performance. Most existing active learning algorithms select only one sample at a time prior to retraining the classifier. Hence, they are computationally expensive and cannot take advantage of parallel labeling systems such as Mechanical Turk. On the other hand, algorithms that allow the selection of multiple samples prior to retraining the classifier, may select samples that have significant information overlap or they involve solving a non-convex optimization. More importantly, the majority of active learning algorithms are developed for a certain classifier type such as SVM. In this paper, we develop an efficient active learning framework based on convex programming, which can select multiple samples at a time for annotation. Unlike the state of the art, our algorithm can be used in conjunction with any type of classifiers, including those of the fam- ily of the recently proposed Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC). We use the two principles of classifier uncertainty and sample diversity in order to guide the optimization program towards selecting the most informative unlabeled samples, which have the least information overlap. Our method can incorporate the data distribution in the selection process by using the appropriate dissimilarity between pairs of samples. We show the effectiveness of our framework in person detection, scene categorization and face recognition on real-world datasets.</p><p>4 0.64571774 <a title="130-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-The_Moving_Pose%3A_An_Efficient_3D_Kinematics_Descriptor_for_Low-Latency_Action_Recognition_and_Detection.html">417 iccv-2013-The Moving Pose: An Efficient 3D Kinematics Descriptor for Low-Latency Action Recognition and Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Mihai Zanfir, Marius Leordeanu, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Human action recognition under low observational latency is receiving a growing interest in computer vision due to rapidly developing technologies in human-robot interaction, computer gaming and surveillance. In this paper we propose a fast, simple, yet powerful non-parametric Moving Pose (MP)frameworkfor low-latency human action and activity recognition. Central to our methodology is a moving pose descriptor that considers both pose information as well as differential quantities (speed and acceleration) of the human body joints within a short time window around the current frame. The proposed descriptor is used in conjunction with a modified kNN classifier that considers both the temporal location of a particular frame within the action sequence as well as the discrimination power of its moving pose descriptor compared to other frames in the training set. The resulting method is non-parametric and enables low-latency recognition, one-shot learning, and action detection in difficult unsegmented sequences. Moreover, the framework is real-time, scalable, and outperforms more sophisticated approaches on challenging benchmarks like MSR-Action3D or MSR-DailyActivities3D.</p><p>5 0.63530558 <a title="130-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Linear_Sequence_Discriminant_Analysis%3A_A_Model-Based_Dimensionality_Reduction_Method_for_Vector_Sequences.html">253 iccv-2013-Linear Sequence Discriminant Analysis: A Model-Based Dimensionality Reduction Method for Vector Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Su, Xiaoqing Ding</p><p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction for vectors in sequences is challenging since labels are attached to sequences as a whole. This paper presents a model-based dimensionality reduction method for vector sequences, namely linear sequence discriminant analysis (LSDA), which attempts to find a subspace in which sequences of the same class are projected together while those of different classes are projected as far as possible. For each sequence class, an HMM is built from states of which statistics are extracted. Means of these states are linked in order to form a mean sequence, and the variance of the sequence class is defined as the sum of all variances of component states. LSDA then learns a transformation by maximizing the separability between sequence classes and at the same time minimizing the within-sequence class scatter. DTW distance between mean sequences is used to measure the separability between sequence classes. We show that the optimization problem can be approximately transformed into an eigen decomposition problem. LDA can be seen as a special case of LSDA by considering non-sequential vectors as sequences of length one. The effectiveness of the proposed LSDA is demonstrated on two individual sequence datasets from UCI machine learning repository as well as two concatenate sequence datasets: APTI Arabic printed text database and IFN/ENIT Arabic handwriting database.</p><p>6 0.63188392 <a title="130-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Model_Recommendation_with_Virtual_Probes_for_Egocentric_Hand_Detection.html">267 iccv-2013-Model Recommendation with Virtual Probes for Egocentric Hand Detection</a></p>

Line detection identifies a large number of salient lines that intersect or nearly intersect in an image, but relatively a few of these apparent junctions correspond to real intersections in the 3D scene. We use linear programming (LP) to identify a minimal set of least-violated connectivity constraints that are sufficient to unambiguously reconstruct the 3D lines. In contrast to prior solutions that primarily focused on well-behaved synthetic line drawings with severely restricting assumptions, we develop an algorithm that can work on real images. The algorithm produces line reconstruction by identifying 95% correct connectivity constraints in York Urban database, with a total computation time of 1 second per image.</p><p>2 0.86415207 <a title="130-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-A_Method_of_Perceptual-Based_Shape_Decomposition.html">21 iccv-2013-A Method of Perceptual-Based Shape Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Chang Ma, Zhongqian Dong, Tingting Jiang, Yizhou Wang, Wen Gao</p><p>Abstract: In thispaper, wepropose a novelperception-based shape decomposition method which aims to decompose a shape into semantically meaningful parts. In addition to three popular perception rules (the Minima rule, the Short-cut rule and the Convexity rule) in shape decomposition, we propose a new rule named part-similarity rule to encourage consistent partition of similar parts. The problem is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and is solved by a trust-region method. Experiment results on MPEG-7 dataset show that we can get a more consistent shape decomposition with human perception compared with other state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, we show the advantage of semantic parts over non-meaningful parts in object detection on the ETHZ dataset.</p><p>3 0.85626286 <a title="130-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Generalized_Iterated_Shrinkage_Algorithm_for_Non-convex_Sparse_Coding.html">14 iccv-2013-A Generalized Iterated Shrinkage Algorithm for Non-convex Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Wangmeng Zuo, Deyu Meng, Lei Zhang, Xiangchu Feng, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In many sparse coding based image restoration and image classification problems, using non-convex ?p-norm minimization (0 ≤ p < 1) can often obtain better results than timhei convex 0?1 -norm m 1)ini camniza otfiteonn. Ab naiunm bbeetrt of algorithms, e.g., iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), iteratively thresholding method (ITM-?p), and look-up table (LUT), have been proposed for non-convex ?p-norm sparse coding, while some analytic solutions have been suggested for some specific values of p. In this paper, by extending the popular soft-thresholding operator, we propose a generalized iterated shrinkage algorithm (GISA) for ?p-norm non-convex sparse coding. Unlike the analytic solutions, the proposed GISA algorithm is easy to implement, and can be adopted for solving non-convex sparse coding problems with arbitrary p values. Compared with LUT, GISA is more general and does not need to compute and store the look-up tables. Compared with IRLS and ITM-?p, GISA is theoretically more solid and can achieve more accurate solutions. Experiments on image restoration and sparse coding based face recognition are conducted to validate the performance of GISA. ××</p><p>4 0.81328261 <a title="130-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Modeling_4D_Human-Object_Interactions_for_Event_and_Object_Recognition.html">268 iccv-2013-Modeling 4D Human-Object Interactions for Event and Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Wei, Yibiao Zhao, Nanning Zheng, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing the events and objects in the video sequence are two challenging tasks due to the complex temporal structures and the large appearance variations. In this paper, we propose a 4D human-object interaction model, where the two tasks jointly boost each other. Our human-object interaction is defined in 4D space: i) the cooccurrence and geometric constraints of human pose and object in 3D space; ii) the sub-events transition and objects coherence in 1D temporal dimension. We represent the structure of events, sub-events and objects in a hierarchical graph. For an input RGB-depth video, we design a dynamic programming beam search algorithm to: i) segment the video, ii) recognize the events, and iii) detect the objects simultaneously. For evaluation, we built a large-scale multiview 3D event dataset which contains 3815 video sequences and 383,036 RGBD frames captured by the Kinect cameras. The experiment results on this dataset show the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.7932229 <a title="130-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Structured_Model_Selection.html">130 iccv-2013-Dynamic Structured Model Selection</a></p>
<p>Author: David Weiss, Benjamin Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: Ben Taskar University of Washington Seattle, WA t as kar @ c s . washingt on . edu In many cases, the predictive power of structured models for for complex vision tasks is limited by a trade-off between the expressiveness and the computational tractability of the model. However, choosing this trade-off statically a priori is suboptimal, as images and videos in different settings vary tremendously in complexity. On the other hand, choosing the trade-off dynamically requires knowledge about the accuracy of different structured models on any given example. In this work, we propose a novel two-tier architecture that provides dynamic speed/accuracy trade-offs through a simple type of introspection. Our approach, which we call dynamic structured model selection (DMS), leverages typically intractable features in structured learning problems in order to automatically determine ’ which of several models should be used at test-time in order to maximize accuracy under a fixed budgetary constraint. We demonstrate DMS on two sequential modeling vision tasks, and we establish a new state-of-the-art in human pose estimation in video with an implementation that is roughly 23 faster than the prevaino uims sptleanmdeanrtda implementation.</p><p>6 0.79192805 <a title="130-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_CRFs_for_Image_Parsing_with_Adaptive_Subgradient_Descent.html">234 iccv-2013-Learning CRFs for Image Parsing with Adaptive Subgradient Descent</a></p>

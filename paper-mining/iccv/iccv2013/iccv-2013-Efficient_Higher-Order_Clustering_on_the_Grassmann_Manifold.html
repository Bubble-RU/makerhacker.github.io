</p><p>6 Introduction In computer vision, the most common scenario requiring higher-order clustering arises when observation vectors are drawn from multiple subspaces of a given vector space or when data fits multi-dimensional parametric forms. [sent-11, score-0.347]
</p><p>7 Evidently, such clustering cannot be achieved using conventional methods that measure distances between or similarities of point pairs. [sent-14, score-0.23]
</p><p>8 Review of Literature Since the literature on clustering is very extensive, in the following we will limit ourselves to a brief review of methods that are of directly relevance to our approach for higher-order clustering. [sent-22, score-0.205]
</p><p>9 For a recent survey of methods for subspace clustering the reader may refer to [16]. [sent-23, score-0.33]
</p><p>10 All the methods we consider use spectral clustering, see [12] for a tutorial on spectral clustering and [17] for a discussion  of related methods in computer vision. [sent-24, score-0.409]
</p><p>11 [8] defines a similarity measure for an n-tuple of data points which leads to a multiway similarity tensor. [sent-27, score-0.384]
</p><p>12 A similarity matrix is estimated by sampling columns from the flattened form of the similarity tensor and spectral clustering is applied. [sent-28, score-0.894]
</p><p>13 While the spectral clustering approach works with a few eigen-vectors of the similarity matrix, our second category of methods explicitly model the low-rank nature of similarity representations. [sent-30, score-0.549]
</p><p>14 In [11] (LRR), subspace clustering is achieved by finding the lowest-rank representation of the data matrix using itself as the dictionary. [sent-37, score-0.367]
</p><p>15 vances in convex optimization and can achieve the desired clustering in the presence of outliers. [sent-42, score-0.233]
</p><p>16 While the methods of [18, 11, 6] can effectively solve the clustering problem, they are computationally expensive. [sent-43, score-0.205]
</p><p>17 Additionally, while using different approaches, these methods eventually build a similarity matrix for spectral clustering, implying that the memory and computational load for these methods can become very large. [sent-45, score-0.41]
</p><p>18 All of these factors imply that despite the desirable property of robustness to outliers, the methods of [18, 11, 6] cannot solve the clustering problem for large datasets. [sent-46, score-0.231]
</p><p>19 Instead of applying spectral clustering to a similarity matrix, we utilise its low-rank properties to directly solve for clustering without explicitly building a similarity matrix. [sent-52, score-0.78]
</p><p>20 Higher-Order Grouping using Tensors In this Section, we summarise the higher-order tensor decomposition of similarity relationships as presented in [8, 3]. [sent-60, score-0.234]
</p><p>21 The N N similarity matrix S uses the similarity between xi and xj, S(i,j)  =  e−φ2(2xσi2,xj)  (1)  where φ(. [sent-65, score-0.314]
</p><p>22 The spectral clustering problem is solved by using the K leading eigen-vectors U = {u1, · · · , uK} of S or equivalently in terms of a nUorm =ali {zued, Laplacian f oofrm S. [sent-68, score-0.307]
</p><p>23 For clustering data into circles, φ(xi, xj) will always be equal to zero since we can always find a circle that passes through any two points xi and xj . [sent-78, score-0.39]
</p><p>24 Similarly, for fitting data to a d-dimensional linear subspace, we need n > d + 1 observations as a ddimensional linear subspace needs (d + 1) parameters to specify it. [sent-80, score-0.237]
</p><p>25 Therefore, to cluster such data, we need to test whether an n-tuple of points belongs to the same cluster for  ×  n ≥ d + 2. [sent-81, score-0.247]

</p><p>33 Ideally, we wleou clldu lteikre otor cmounlsttirpulect cSlu only from pure columns but a uniform sampling strategy fails in this regard, especially for large N. [sent-131, score-0.295]
</p><p>34 76% of columns are pure, implying that uniform sampling would not work well. [sent-134, score-0.262]
</p><p>35 SCC starts by uniformly sampling the columns and clustering the data. [sent-136, score-0.4]
</p><p>36 3, the computational load of estimating the entries in an individual column of P can be significant. [sent-145, score-0.303]

</p><p>46 6 accurately represents the underlying similarity measure while greatly reducing the computational expense involved when compared to the computational load of estimating individual entries of a column in P as defined in both [8] and [3]. [sent-180, score-0.424]
</p><p>47 1, much of the recent work on higher-order grouping presents different methods that build a similarity matrix between data points and then use spectral clustering. [sent-183, score-0.389]
</p><p>48 We recall that for a dataset of N points, spectral clustering requires an N N similarity mNa ptroixin tSs o spf ewchtriaclh c tlhuset eKri leading eigen-vectors are estimated. [sent-185, score-0.428]
</p><p>49 It is evident that as the data size N increases, so does the requirement for storage of S as well as the computational load for both estimating the entries of S and its eigen-decomposition. [sent-186, score-0.228]

</p><p>51 For a vector space RN, the space of all linear subspaces of K dimensions forms a compact Riemannian manifold known as the Grassmann manifold which is denoted as G(N, K). [sent-203, score-0.26]
</p><p>52 For our purposes, we note that since P is an N C matrix of effective rank equal to sKin, tehe P eigen-vectors CU m =atr x{u o1f , ·e ·f ·f , utiKve} tahnakt we aslee tok span a eK ei-gdeimn-evnescitoonrsal subspace o,f· ·R··N ,,u i. [sent-214, score-0.187]

</p><p>54 GROUSE was specifically designed to track a K-dimensional subspace of RN and uses matrix columns as input to incrementally update the subspace U on the Grassmann manifold G(N, K). [sent-224, score-0.578]
</p><p>55 In a manner similar to recent advances in matrix completion, GROUSE can efficiently learn the basis U even when only some of the entries of the columns of P are available. [sent-232, score-0.297]
</p><p>56 This is a great advantage for our problem since by using GROUSE, we need not compute all the entries of a column of P. [sent-233, score-0.211]

</p><p>61 Sparse Grassmann Clustering (SGC) We can now state our algorithm that carries out higherorder clustering by combining an iterative refinement ofcolumn sampling with an incremental Grassmann update of U. [sent-263, score-0.342]
</p><p>62 As we do not need all the entries of a column of P to update U, we can sparsely estimate a few of the entries in a given column pj . [sent-264, score-0.59]
</p><p>63 We initially use uniform random sampling to draw columns from P to build an initial clustering estimate. [sent-266, score-0.457]
</p><p>64 Subsequently, during each iteration, we draw T columns according to the current cluster estimates. [sent-267, score-0.228]
</p><p>65 For each column we estimate a few of the entries using the approximate similarity of Eqn. [sent-268, score-0.357]
</p><p>66 After each iteration, we carry out the K-means clustering of the rows of the Grassmann estimate U ∈ G(N, K) and update the sampling afsosrm tahen nn eesxtti mitaetraeti Uon ∈to G b(eN b,aKse)d on t uhped catuerre thnet clusters. [sent-271, score-0.367]
</p><p>67 Due to the efficiency of the GROUSE algorithm, in all of our experiments we have found that our SGC algorithm rapidly converges to the final clustering estimate. [sent-274, score-0.205]
</p><p>68 We note that while the initial random sampling produces a rough clustering estimate, over subsequent iterations, this estimate is progressively refined by our algorithm thus yielding increasingly pure columns. [sent-275, score-0.367]
</p><p>69 Properties of the SGC algorithm Handling multiple subspaces : Most methods that carry out estimation on the Grassmann manifold fit a single 3355 0158  subspace to the observations. [sent-278, score-0.349]
</p><p>70 Unlike other methods that fit a single subspace to the observations, we map the observations into a similarity representation that measures the similarity or affinity relationships between data points. [sent-282, score-0.44]
</p><p>71 Thus, although the raw data points belong to a union of K subspaces, independent of K, our SGC method maps the data points into a representation that lies in a single subspace U ∈ G(N, K). [sent-283, score-0.365]

</p><p>73 ×  Memory and computational requirements : From the arguments of [2], we can see that for an N point dataset to be clustered into K subspaces, each iteration of our SGC algorithm takes O(TNK + ρTK2) flops where ρ is the number of entries estimated in each sampled column. [sent-286, score-0.217]
</p><p>74 In terms of storage requirements, our approach is extremely light-weight as it does not need to store the full N N similarity mhta tarsix i. [sent-287, score-0.183]

</p><p>76 It is germane to remark here that the notion of sparsity in our SGC algorithm applies to the fact that we only need a sparse number of entries used in individual columns and this should not be confused with the nature of sparsity in methods such as SSC [6]. [sent-294, score-0.363]

</p><p>78 As can be seen our method can correctly segment points into 5 circles which cannot be achieved by spectral clustering using Eqn. [sent-321, score-0.506]
</p><p>79 2, we show the clustering results achieved on the well-known psychophysical model of the Kanizsa triangle. [sent-324, score-0.205]
</p><p>80 Since we sample points to build a model and score all other points with respect to this model, in our SGC method we can simultaneously cluster data into different types of geometric models. [sent-325, score-0.305]
</p><p>81 In this instance during one iteration of the for-loop in Algorithm 1 we sample columns according to both the circle and line model. [sent-326, score-0.177]
</p><p>82 It should be noted that the correct classification of points into circles or lines is automatically achieved using our approach where higher-order similarity information can be integrated across multiple types of  models. [sent-329, score-0.364]
</p><p>83 2 also demonstrates the robustness of our method since, as far as points on circles are concerned, the  raw depth map of size  (480  ×  640)  3355 0169  pixels while (c) show the segmentation of the depth map into planes using our SGC algorithm. [sent-333, score-0.321]
</p><p>84 The input data contains two intersecting circles of 100 points each, interspersed with 100 outlier points, i. [sent-339, score-0.199]
</p><p>85 In our SGC method, the measured similarities between pairs of points that belong to the same circle is high, leading to the correct classification of the two circles as independent clusters. [sent-344, score-0.311]
</p><p>86 Consequently, all the randomly scattered outlier points are assigned to the third  ××  cluster as these points cannot be classified as belonging to either of the two circle clusters. [sent-345, score-0.385]
</p><p>87 =Ho 3w07e2ve0r0, since we neither store the individual sampled columns of P nor actually estimate all entries of each column, our segmentation algorithm has a small memory footprint as we only need to estimate U ∈ G(307200, K) which is equivalent etoe storing iKm depth maps i3n0 memory. [sent-357, score-0.503]

<p>Author: Yingya Zhang, Zhenan Sun, Ran He, Tieniu Tan</p><p>Abstract: Subspace clustering has important and wide applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. It is a challenging task to learn low-dimensional subspace structures due to the possible errors (e.g., noise and corruptions) existing in high-dimensional data. Recent subspace clustering methods usually assume a sparse representation of corrupted errors and correct the errors iteratively. However large corruptions in real-world applications can not be well addressed by these methods. A novel optimization model for robust subspace clustering is proposed in this paper. The objective function of our model mainly includes two parts. The first part aims to achieve a sparse representation of each high-dimensional data point with other data points. The second part aims to maximize the correntropy between a given data point and its low-dimensional representation with other points. Correntropy is a robust measure so that the influence of large corruptions on subspace clustering can be greatly suppressed. An extension of our method with explicit introduction of representation error terms into the model is also proposed. Half-quadratic minimization is provided as an efficient solution to the proposed robust subspace clustering formulations. Experimental results on Hopkins 155 dataset and Extended Yale Database B demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.</p><p>5 0.18074638 <a title="134-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_by_Domain_Invariant_Projection.html">435 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Domain Invariant Projection</a></p>
<p>Author: Mahsa Baktashmotlagh, Mehrtash T. Harandi, Brian C. Lovell, Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: Domain-invariant representations are key to addressing the domain shift problem where the training and test examples follow different distributions. Existing techniques that have attempted to match the distributions of the source and target domains typically compare these distributions in the original feature space. This space, however, may not be directly suitable for such a comparison, since some of the features may have been distorted by the domain shift, or may be domain specific. In this paper, we introduce a Domain Invariant Projection approach: An unsupervised domain adaptation method that overcomes this issue by extracting the information that is invariant across the source and target domains. More specifically, we learn a projection of the data to a low-dimensional latent space where the distance between the empirical distributions of the source and target examples is minimized. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of visual object recognition and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a standard domain adaptation benchmark dataset.</p><p>6 0.16399513 <a title="134-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Perspective_Motion_Segmentation_via_Collaborative_Clustering.html">314 iccv-2013-Perspective Motion Segmentation via Collaborative Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jiashi Feng, Zhouchen Lin, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the subspace segmentation problem. Given a set of data points drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to partition them into their underlying subspaces they were drawn from. The spectral clustering method is used as the framework. It requires to find an affinity matrix which is close to block diagonal, with nonzero entries corresponding to the data point pairs from the same subspace. In this work, we argue that both sparsity and the grouping effect are important for subspace segmentation. A sparse affinity matrix tends to be block diagonal, with less connections between data points from different subspaces. The grouping effect ensures that the highly corrected data which are usually from the same subspace can be grouped together. Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), by using ?1-minimization, encourages sparsity for data selection, but it lacks of the grouping effect. On the contrary, Low-RankRepresentation (LRR), by rank minimization, and Least Squares Regression (LSR), by ?2-regularization, exhibit strong grouping effect, but they are short in subset selection. Thus the obtained affinity matrix is usually very sparse by SSC, yet very dense by LRR and LSR. In this work, we propose the Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation (CASS) method by using trace Lasso. CASS is a data correlation dependent method which simultaneously performs automatic data selection and groups correlated data together. It can be regarded as a method which adaptively balances SSC and LSR. Both theoretical and experimental results show the effectiveness of CASS.</p><p>5 0.63749349 <a title="134-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Dictionary_Learning_and_Sparse_Coding_on_Grassmann_Manifolds%3A_An_Extrinsic_Solution.html">114 iccv-2013-Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding on Grassmann Manifolds: An Extrinsic Solution</a></p>

By exploiting recent advances in online estimation on the Grassmann manifold (GROUSE) we develop an efficient and accurate algorithm that works with individual columns of similarities or partial observations thereof. Since it avoids the storage and decomposition of large similarity matrices, our method is efficient, scalable and has low memory requirements even for large-scale data. We demonstrate the performance of our SGC method on a variety of segmentation problems including planar seg- mentation of Kinect depth maps and motion segmentation of the Hopkins 155 dataset for which we achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art.</p><p>2 0.76323378 <a title="134-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-From_Where_and_How_to_What_We_See.html">180 iccv-2013-From Where and How to What We See</a></p>

Manjunath</p><p>Abstract: Eye movement studies have confirmed that overt attention is highly biased towards faces and text regions in images. In this paper we explore a novel problem of predicting face and text regions in images using eye tracking data from multiple subjects. The problem is challenging as we aim to predict the semantics (face/text/background) only from eye tracking data without utilizing any image information. The proposed algorithm spatially clusters eye tracking data obtained in an image into different coherent groups and subsequently models the likelihood of the clusters containing faces and text using afully connectedMarkov Random Field (MRF). Given the eye tracking datafrom a test image, itpredicts potential face/head (humans, dogs and cats) and text locations reliably. Furthermore, the approach can be used to select regions of interest for further analysis by object detectors for faces and text. The hybrid eye position/object detector approach achieves better detection performance and reduced computation time compared to using only the object detection algorithm. We also present a new eye tracking dataset on 300 images selected from ICDAR, Street-view, Flickr and Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset from 15 subjects.</p><p>3 0.76163667 <a title="134-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Semi-supervised_Robust_Dictionary_Learning_via_Efficient_l-Norms_Minimization.html">384 iccv-2013-Semi-supervised Robust Dictionary Learning via Efficient l-Norms Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Weidong Cai, Heng Huang</p><p>Abstract: Representing the raw input of a data set by a set of relevant codes is crucial to many computer vision applications. Due to the intrinsic sparse property of real-world data, dictionary learning, in which the linear decomposition of a data point uses a set of learned dictionary bases, i.e., codes, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, traditional dictionary learning methods suffer from three weaknesses: sensitivity to noisy and outlier samples, difficulty to determine the optimal dictionary size, and incapability to incorporate supervision information. In this paper, we address these weaknesses by learning a Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSR-D). Specifically, we use the ℓ2,0+ norm as the loss function to improve the robustness against outliers, and develop a new structured sparse regularization com, , tom. . cai@sydney . edu . au , heng@uta .edu make the learning tasks easier to deal with and reduce the computational cost. For example, in image tagging, instead of using the raw pixel-wise features, semi-local or patch- based features, such as SIFT and geometric blur, are usually more desirable to achieve better performance. In practice, finding a set of compact features bases, also referred to as dictionary, with enhanced representative and discriminative power, plays a significant role in building a successful computer vision system. In this paper, we explore this important problem by proposing a novel formulation and its solution for learning Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSRD), where we examine the challenges in dictionary learning, and seek opportunities to overcome them and improve the dictionary qualities. 1.1. Challenges in Dictionary Learning to incorporate the supervision information in dictionary learning, without incurring additional parameters. Moreover, the optimal dictionary size is automatically learned from the input data. Minimizing the derived objective function is challenging because it involves many non-smooth ℓ2,0+ -norm terms. We present an efficient algorithm to solve the problem with a rigorous proof of the convergence of the algorithm. Extensive experiments are presented to show the superior performance of the proposed method.</p><p>4 0.76111543 <a title="134-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Regionlets_for_Generic_Object_Detection.html">349 iccv-2013-Regionlets for Generic Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoyu Wang, Ming Yang, Shenghuo Zhu, Yuanqing Lin</p><p>Abstract: Generic object detection is confronted by dealing with different degrees of variations in distinct object classes with tractable computations, which demands for descriptive and flexible object representations that are also efficient to evaluate for many locations. In view of this, we propose to model an object class by a cascaded boosting classifier which integrates various types of features from competing local regions, named as regionlets. A regionlet is a base feature extraction region defined proportionally to a detection window at an arbitrary resolution (i.e. size and aspect ratio). These regionlets are organized in small groups with stable relative positions to delineate fine-grained spatial layouts inside objects. Their features are aggregated to a one-dimensional feature within one group so as to tolerate deformations. Then we evaluate the object bounding box proposal in selective search from segmentation cues, limiting the evaluation locations to thousands. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on popular multi-class detection benchmark datasets with a single method, without any contexts. It achieves the detec- tion mean average precision of 41. 7% on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and 39. 7% on the VOC 2010 for 20 object categories. It achieves 14. 7% mean average precision on the ImageNet dataset for 200 object categories, outperforming the latest deformable part-based model (DPM) by 4. 7%.</p><p>5 0.7595222 <a title="134-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_Salient_Region_Detection_with_Soft_Image_Abstraction.html">137 iccv-2013-Efficient Salient Region Detection with Soft Image Abstraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming-Ming Cheng, Jonathan Warrell, Wen-Yan Lin, Shuai Zheng, Vibhav Vineet, Nigel Crook</p><p>Abstract: Detecting visually salient regions in images is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision. We propose a novel method to decompose an image into large scale perceptually homogeneous elements for efficient salient region detection, using a soft image abstraction representation. By considering both appearance similarity and spatial distribution of image pixels, the proposed representation abstracts out unnecessary image details, allowing the assignment of comparable saliency values across similar regions, and producing perceptually accurate salient region detection. We evaluate our salient region detection approach on the largest publicly available dataset with pixel accurate annotations. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms 18 alternate methods, reducing the mean absolute error by 25.2% compared to the previous best result, while being computationally more efficient.</p><p>6 0.75842595 <a title="134-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Label_Propagation_for_Semi-supervised_Multi-class_Multi-label_Classification.html">126 iccv-2013-Dynamic Label Propagation for Semi-supervised Multi-class Multi-label Classification</a></p>

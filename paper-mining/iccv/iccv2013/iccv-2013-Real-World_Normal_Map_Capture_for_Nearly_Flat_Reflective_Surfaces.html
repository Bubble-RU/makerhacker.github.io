<p>Author: Michael Weinmann, Aljosa Osep, Roland Ruiters, Reinhard Klein</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel, robust multi-view normal field integration technique for reconstructing the full 3D shape of mirroring objects. We employ a turntablebased setup with several cameras and displays. These are used to display illumination patterns which are reflected by the object surface. The pattern information observed in the cameras enables the calculation of individual volumetric normal fields for each combination of camera, display and turntable angle. As the pattern information might be blurred depending on the surface curvature or due to nonperfect mirroring surface characteristics, we locally adapt the decoding to the finest still resolvable pattern resolution. In complex real-world scenarios, the normal fields contain regions without observations due to occlusions and outliers due to interreflections and noise. Therefore, a robust reconstruction using only normal information is challenging. Via a non-parametric clustering of normal hypotheses derived for each point in the scene, we obtain both the most likely local surface normal and a local surface consistency estimate. This information is utilized in an iterative mincut based variational approach to reconstruct the surface geometry.</p><p>3 0.28294393 <a title="343-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Example-Based_Facade_Texture_Synthesis.html">148 iccv-2013-Example-Based Facade Texture Synthesis</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu Li, Michael S. Brown</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an automatic method for removing reflection interference when imaging a scene behind a glass surface. Our approach exploits the subtle changes in the reflection with respect to the background in a small set of images taken at slightly different view points. Key to this idea is the use of SIFT-flow to align the images such that a pixel-wise comparison can be made across the input set. Gradients with variation across the image set are assumed to belong to the reflected scenes while constant gradients are assumed to belong to the desired background scene. By correctly labelling gradients belonging to reflection or background, the background scene can be separated from the reflection interference. Unlike previous approaches that exploit motion, our approach does not make any assumptions regarding the background or reflected scenes’ geometry, nor requires the reflection to be static. This makes our approach practical for use in casual imaging scenarios. Our approach is straight forward and produces good results compared with existing methods. 1. Introduction and Related Work There are situations when a scene must be imaged behind a pane of glass. This is common when “window shopping” where one takes a photograph of an object behind a window. This is not a conducive setup for imaging as the glass will produce an unwanted layer of reflection in the resulting image. This problem can be treated as one of layer separation [7, 8], where the captured image I a linear combiis nation of a reflection layer IR and the desired background scene, IB, as follows: I IR + IB. = (1) The goal of reflection removal is to separate IB and IR from an input image I shown in Figure 1. as This problem is ill-posed, as it requires extracting two layers from one image. To make the problem tractable additional information, either supplied from the user or from Fig. 1. Example of our approach separating the background (IB) and reflection (IR) layers of one of the input images. Note that the reflection layer’s contrast has been boosted to improve visualization. multiple images, is required. For example, Levin and Weiss [7, 8] proposed a method where a user labelled image gradients as belonging to either background or reflection. Combing the markup with an optimization that imposed a sparsity prior on the separated images, their method produced compelling results. The only drawback was the need for user intervention. An automatic method was proposed by Levin et al. [9] that found the most likely decomposition which minimized the total number of edges and corners in the recovered image using a database of natural images. As 22443322 with example-based methods, the results were reliant on the similarity of the examples in the database. Another common strategy is to use multiple images. Some methods assume a fixed camera that is able to capture a set of images with different mixing of the layers through various means, e.g. rotating a polarized lens [3, 6, 12, 16, 17], changing focus [15], or applying a flash [1]. While these approaches demonstrate good results, the ability of controlling focal change, polarization, and flash may not always be possible. Sarel and Irani [13, 14] proposed video based methods that work by assuming the two layers, reflection and background, to be statistically uncorrelated. These methods can handle complex geometry in the reflection layer, but require a long image sequence such that the reflection layer has significant changes in order for a median-based approach [21] to extract the intrinsic image from the sequence as the initial guess for one of the layers. Techniques closer to ours exploit motion between the layers present in multiple images. In particular, when the background is captured from different points of view, the background and the reflection layers undergo different motions due to their different distance to the transparent layer. One issue with changing viewpoint is handling alignment among the images. Szeliski et al. [19] proposed a method that could simultaneously recover the two layers by assuming they were both static scenes and related by parametric transformations (i.e. homographies). Gai et al. [4, 5] proposed a similar approach that aligned the images in the gradient domain using gradient sparsity, again assuming static scenes. Tsin et al. [20] relaxed the planar scene constraint in [19] and used dense stereo correspondence with stereo matching configuration which limits the camera motion to unidirectional parallel motion. These approaches produce good results, but the constraint on scene geometry and assumed motion of the camera limit the type of scenes that can be processed. Our Contribution Our proposed method builds on the single-image approach by Levin and Weiss [8], but removes the need for user markup by examining the relative motion in a small set (e.g. 3-5) of images to automatically label gradients as either reflection or background. This is done by first aligning the images using SIFT-flow and then examining the variation in the gradients over the image set. Gradients with more variation are assumed to be from reflection while constant gradients are assumed to be from the desired background. While a simple idea, this approach does not impose any restrictions on the scene or reflection geometry. This allows a more practical imaging setup that is suitable for handheld cameras. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 overviews our approach; section 3 compares our results with prior methods on several examples; the paper is concluded in section 4. Warped ? ?Recovered ? ? Recovered ? ? Warp e d ? ?Recover d ? ? Recover d ? ? Fig. 2. This figure shows the separated layers of the first two input images. The layers illustrate that the background image IB has lit- tle variation while the reflection layers, IRi ,have notable variation due to the viewpoint change. 2. Reflection Removal Method 2.1. Imaging Assumption and Procedure The input ofour approach is a small set of k images taken of the scene from slightly varying view points. We assume the background dominates in the mixture image and the images are related by a warping, such that the background is registered and the reflection layer is changing. This relationship can be expressed as: Ii = wi(IRi + IB), (2) where Ii is the i-th mixture image, {wi}, i = 1, . . . , k are warping fuisn tchteio in-sth hcma uisxetud by mthaeg camera viewpoint change with respect to a reference image (in our case I1). Assuming we can estimate the inverse warps, w−i1, where w−11 is the identity, we get the following relationship: wi−1(Ii) = IRi + IB. (3) Even though IB appears static in the mixture image, the problem is still ill-posed given we have more unknowns than the number of input images. However, the presence of a static IB in the image set makes it possible to identify gradient edges of the background layer IB and edges of the changing reflection layers IRi . More specifically, edges in IB are assumed to appear every time in the image set while the edges in the reflection layer IRi are assumed to vary across the set. This reflection-change effect can be seen in Figure 2. This means edges can be labelled based on the frequency of a gradient appearing at a particular pixel across the aligned input images. After labelling edges as either background or reflection, we can reconstruct the two layers using an optimization that imposes the sparsity prior on the separated layers as done by [7, 8]. Figure 3 shows the processing pipeline of our approach. Each step is described in the following sections. 22443333 Fig. 3. This figure shows the pipeline of our approach: 1) warping functions are estimated to align the inputs to a reference view; 2) the edges are labelled as either background or foreground based on gradient frequency; 3) a reconstruction step is used to separate the two layers; 4) all recovered background layers are combined together to get the final recovered background. 2.2. Warping Our approach begins by estimating warping functions, w−i1, to register the input to the reference image. Previous approaches estimated these warps using global parametric motion (e.g. homographies [4, 5, 19]), however, the planarity constraint often leads to regions in the image with misalignments when the scene is not planar. Traditional dense correspondence method like optical flow is another option. However, even with our assumption that the background should be more prominent than the reflection layer, optical flow methods (e.g. [2, 18]) that are based on image intensity gave poor performance due to the reflection interference. This led us to try SIFT-flow [10] that is based on more robust image features. SIFT-flow [10] proved to work surprisingly well on our input sequences and provide a dense warp suitable to bring the images into alignment even under moderate interference of reflection. Empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of SIFT-flow in this task as well as the comparison with optical flow are shown in our supplemental materials. Our implementation fixes I1 as the reference, then uses SIFT-flow to estimate the inverse-warping functions {w−i1 }, i= 2, . . . , k for each ofthe input images I2 , . . . , Ik against ,I 1i . = W 2e, a.l.s.o, compute htohef gradient magnitudes Gi of the each input image and then warp the images Ii as well as the gradient magnitudes Gi using the same inverse-warping function w−i1, denoting the warped images and gradient magnitudes as Iˆi and Gˆi. 2.3. Edge separation Our approach first identifies salient edges using a simple threshold on the gradient magnitudes in Gˆi. The resulting binary edge map is denoted as Ei. After edge detection, the edges need to be separated as either background or foreground in each aligned image Iˆi. As previously discussed, the edges of the background layer should appear frequently across all the warped images while the edges of the reflection layer would only have sparse presence. To examine the sparsity of the edge occurrence, we use the following measurement: Φ(y) =??yy??2221, (4) where y is a vector containing the gradient magnitudes at a given pixel location. Since all elements in y are non-negative, we can rewrite equation 4 as Φ(y) = yi)2. This measurement can be conside?red as a L1? normalized L2 norm. It measures the sparsity o?f the vecto?r which achieves its maximum value of 1when only one non-zero item exists and achieve its minimum value of k1 when all items are non-zero and have identical values (i.e. y1 = y2 = . . . = yk > 0). This measurement is used to assign two probabilities to each edge pixel as belonging to either background or reflection. We estimate the reflection edge probability by examining ?ik=1 yi2/(?ik=1 22443344 the edge occurrence, as follows: PRi(x) = s?(??iikk==11GGˆˆii((xx))2)2−k1?,(5) Gˆi Iˆi. where, (x) is the gradient magnitude at pixel x of We subtract k1 to move the smallest value close to zero. The sparsity measurement is further stretched by a sigmoid function s(t) = (1 + e−(t−0.05)/0.05)−1 to facilitate the separation. The background edge probability is then estimated by: PBi(x) = s?−?(??iikk==11GGˆˆii((xx))2)2−k1??,(6) where PBi (x) + PRi (x) = ?1. These probabilities are defined only at the pixels that are edges in the image. We consider only edge pixels with relatively high probability in either the background edge probability map or reflection edge probability map. The final edge separation is performed by thresholding the two probability maps as: EBi/Ri(x) =⎨⎧ 10, Ei(x) = 1 aotndhe PrwBiis/eRi(x) > 0.6 Figure 4 shows ⎩the edge separation procedure. 2.4. Layer Reconstruction With the separated edges of the background and the reflection, we can reconstruct the two layers. Levin and Weis- ???????????? Gˆ Fig. 4. Edge separation illustration: 1) shows the all gradient maps in this case we have five input images; 2) plots the gradient values at two position across the five images - top plot is a pixel on a background edge, bottom plot is a pixel on a reflection edge; 3) shows the probability map estimated for each layer; 4) Final edge separation after thresholding the probability maps. s [7, 8] showed that the long tailed distribution of gradients in natural scenes is an effective prior in this problem. This kind of distributions is well modelled by a Laplacian or hyper-Laplacian distribution (P(t) ∝ p = 1for – e−|t|p/s, Laplacian and p < 1 for hyper-Laplacian). In our work, we use Laplacian approximation since the L1 norm converges quickly with good results. For each image Iˆi , we try to maximize the probability P(IBi , IRi ) in order to separate the two layers and this is equivalent to minimizing the cost log P(IBi , IRi ). Following the same deduction tinh e[ c7]o,s tw −ithlo tgheP independent assumption of the two layers (i.e. P(IBi , IRi ) = P(IBi ) · P(IRi )), the objective function becomes: − J(IBi) = ? |(IBi ∗ fn)(x)| + |((Iˆi − IBi) ∗ fn)(x)| ?x, ?n + λ?EBi(x)|((Iˆi − IBi) ∗ fn)(x)| ?x, ?n + λ?ERi(x)|(IBi ?x,n ∗ fn)(x)|, (7) where fn denotes the derivative filters and ∗ is the 2D convolution operator. hFeo rd efrniv, we use trwso a nodri e∗n istat tihoen 2s Dan cdo nt-wo degrees (first order and second order) derivative filters. While the first term in the objective function keeps the gradients of the two layer as sparse as possible, the last two terms force the gradients of IBi at edges positions in EBi to agree with the gradients of input image Iˆi and gradients of IRi at edge positions in ERi agree with the gradients of Iˆi. This equation can be further rewritten in the form of J = ?Au b? 1 and be minimized efficiently using iterative − reweighted lbea?st square [11]. 2.5. Combining the Results Our approach processes each image in the input set independently. Due to the reflective glass surface, some of the images may contain saturated regions from specular highlights. When saturation occurs, we can not fully recover the structure in these saturated regions because the information about the two layers are lost. In addition, sometimes the edges of the reflection in some regions are too weak to be correctly distinguished. This can lead to local regions in the background where the reflection is still present. These erroneous regions are often in different places in each input image due to changes in the reflection. In such cases, it is reasonable to assume that the minimum value across all recovered background layers may be a proper approximation of the true background. As such, the last step of our method is to take the minimum of the pixel value of all reconstructed background images as the final recovered background, as follows: IB (x) = mini IBi (x) . 22443355 (8) Fig. 5. This figure shows our combination procedure. The recovered background on each single image is good at first glance but may have reflection remaining in local regions. A simple minimum operator combining all recovered images gives a better result in these regions. The comparison can be seen in the zoomed-in regions. × Based on this, the reflection layer of each input image can be computed by IRi = IB . The effectiveness of this combination procedure is ill−us Itrated in Figure 5. Iˆi − 3. Results In this section, we present the experimental results of our proposed method. Additional results and test cases can be found in the accompanying supplemental materials. The experiments were conducted on an Intel i7? PC (3.4GHz CPU, 8.0GB RAM). The code was implemented in Matlab. We use the SIFT-Flow implementation provided by the authors 1. Matlab code and images used in our paper can be downloaded at the author’s webpage 2. The entire procedure outlined in Figure 3 takes approximately five minutes for a 500 400 image sequence containing up to five images.

Figure 6 shows two examples of our edge separation results and final reconstructed background layers and reflection layers. Our method provides a clear separation of the edges of the two layers which is crucial in the reconstruc- 1http://people.csail.mit.edu/celiu/SIFTflow/SIFTflow.zip 2http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/ liyu1988/ tion step. Figure 9 shows more reflection removal results of our method. We also compare our methods with those in [8] and [5]. For the method in [8], we use the source code 3 of the author to generate the results. The comparisons between our and [8] are not entirely fair since [8] uses single image to generate the result, while we have the advantage of the entire set. For the results produced by [8], the reference view was used as input. The required user-markup is also provided. For the method in [5], we set the layer number to be one, and estimate the motions of the background layer using their method. In the reconstruction phase, we set the remaining reflection layer in k input mixture images as k different layers, each only appearing once in one mixture. Figure 8 shows the results of two examples. Our results are arguably the best. The results of [8] still exhibited some edges from different layers even with the elaborate user mark-ups. This may be fixed by going back to further refine the user markup. But in the heavily overlapping edge regions, it is challenging for users to indicate the edges. If the edges are not clearly indicated the results tend to be over smoothed in one layer. For the method of [5], since it uses global transformations to align images, local misalignment effects often appear in the final recovered background image. Also, their approach uses all the input image into the optimization to recover the layers. This may lead to the result that has edges from different reflection layers of different images mixed and appear as ghosting effect in the recovered background image. For heavily saturated regions, none of the two previous methods can give visually plausible results like ours. 4. Discussion and Conclusion We have presented a method to automatically remove reflectance interference due to a glass surface. Our approach works by capturing a set of images of a scene from slightly varying view points. The images are then aligned and edges are labelled as belonging to either background or reflectance. This alignment was enabled by SIFT-flow, whose robustness to the reflection interference enabled our method. When using SIFT-flow, we assume that the background layer will be the most prominent and will provide sufficient SIFT features for matching. While we found this to work well in practice, images with very strong reflectance can produce poor alignment as SIFT-flow may attempt to align to the foreground which is changing. This will cause problems in the subsequent layer separation. Figure 7 shows such a case. While these failures can often be handled by cropping the image or simple user input (see supplemental material), it is a notable issue. Another challenging issue is when the background scene 3http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/ levina/papers/reflections.zip 22443366 ??? ??? ?? ??? Fig. 6. Example of edge separation results and recovered background and foreground layer using our method has large homogeneous regions. In such cases there are no edges to be labelled as background. This makes subsequent separation challenging, especially when the reflection interference in these regions is weak but still visually noticeable. While this problem is not unique to our approach, it is an issue to consider. We also found that by combining all the background results of the input images we can overcome Fig. 7. A failure case of our approach due to dominant reflection against the background in some regions (i.e. the upper part of the phonograph). This will cause unsatisfactory alignment of the background in the warping procedure which further lead to our edge separation and final reconstruction failure as can be seen in the figure. local regions with high saturation. While a simple idea, this combination strategy can be incorporated into other techniques to improve their results. Lastly, we believe reflection removal is an application that would be welcomed on many mobile devices, however, the current processing time is still too long for real world use. Exploring ways to speed up the processing pipeline is an area of interest for future work. Acknowledgement This work was supported by Singapore A*STAR PSF grant 11212100. References [1] A. K.

<p>Author: Ruiqi Guo, Derek Hoiem</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach to predict the extent and height of supporting surfaces such as tables, chairs, and cabinet tops from a single RGBD image. We define support surfaces to be horizontal, planar surfaces that can physically support objects and humans. Given a RGBD image, our goal is to localize the height and full extent of such surfaces in 3D space. To achieve this, we created a labeling tool and annotated 1449 images with rich, complete 3D scene models in NYU dataset. We extract ground truth from the annotated dataset and developed a pipeline for predicting floor space, walls, the height and full extent of support surfaces. Finally we match the predicted extent with annotated scenes in training scenes and transfer the the support surface configuration from training scenes. We evaluate the proposed approach in our dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in understanding scenes in 3D space.</p><p>6 0.19656578 <a title="343-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Compensating_for_Motion_during_Direct-Global_Separation.html">82 iccv-2013-Compensating for Motion during Direct-Global Separation</a></p>

<p>Author: Bastien Jacquet, Christian Häne, Kevin Köser, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Although specular objects have gained interest in recent years, virtually no approaches exist for markerless reconstruction of reflective scenes in the wild. In this work, we present a practical approach to capturing normal maps in real-world scenes using video only. We focus on nearly planar surfaces such as windows, facades from glass or metal, or frames, screens and other indoor objects and show how normal maps of these can be obtained without the use of an artificial calibration object. Rather, we track the reflections of real-world straight lines, while moving with a hand-held or vehicle-mounted camera in front of the object. In contrast to error-prone local edge tracking, we obtain the reflections by a robust, global segmentation technique of an ortho-rectified 3D video cube that also naturally allows efficient user interaction. Then, at each point of the reflective surface, the resulting 2D-curve to 3D-line correspondence provides a novel quadratic constraint on the local surface normal. This allows to globally solve for the shape by integrability and smoothness constraints and easily supports the usage of multiple lines. We demonstrate the technique on several objects and facades.</p><p>2 0.8604809 <a title="343-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Normal_Field_Integration_for_3D_Reconstruction_of_Mirroring_Objects.html">281 iccv-2013-Multi-view Normal Field Integration for 3D Reconstruction of Mirroring Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Weinmann, Aljosa Osep, Roland Ruiters, Reinhard Klein</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel, robust multi-view normal field integration technique for reconstructing the full 3D shape of mirroring objects. We employ a turntablebased setup with several cameras and displays. These are used to display illumination patterns which are reflected by the object surface. The pattern information observed in the cameras enables the calculation of individual volumetric normal fields for each combination of camera, display and turntable angle. As the pattern information might be blurred depending on the surface curvature or due to nonperfect mirroring surface characteristics, we locally adapt the decoding to the finest still resolvable pattern resolution. In complex real-world scenarios, the normal fields contain regions without observations due to occlusions and outliers due to interreflections and noise. Therefore, a robust reconstruction using only normal information is challenging. Via a non-parametric clustering of normal hypotheses derived for each point in the scene, we obtain both the most likely local surface normal and a local surface consistency estimate. This information is utilized in an iterative mincut based variational approach to reconstruct the surface geometry.</p><p>3 0.72494543 <a title="343-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Matching_Dry_to_Wet_Materials.html">262 iccv-2013-Matching Dry to Wet Materials</a></p>
<p>Author: Yaser Yacoob</p><p>Abstract: When a translucent liquid is spilled over a rough surface it causes a significant change in the visual appearance of the surface. This wetting phenomenon is easily detected by humans, and an early model was devised by the physicist Andres Jonas Angstrom nearly a century ago. In this pa. umd . edu per we investigate the problem of determining if a wet/dry relationship between two image patches explains the differences in their visual appearance. Water tends to be the typical liquid involved and therefore it is the main objective. At the same time, we consider the general problem where the liquid has some of the characteristics of water (i.e., a similar refractive index), but has an unknown spectral absorption profile (e.g., coffee, tea, wine, etc.). We report on several experiments using our own images, a publicly available dataset, and images downloaded from the web. 1. Background When a material absorbs a liquid it changes visual appearance due to richer light reflection and refraction processes. Humans easily detect wet versus dry surfaces, and are capable of integrating this ability in object detection and segmentation. As a result, a wet part of a surface is associated with the dry part of the same surface despite significant differences in their appearance. For example, when driving over a partially wet road surface it is easily recognized as a drivable surface. Similarly, a wine spill on a couch is recognized as a stain and not a separate object. The same capability is harder to implement in computer vision since the basic attributes of edges, color distributions and texture are disrupted in the wetting process. Engineering algorithms around these changes has not received attention in published research. Nevertheless, such capability is needed to cope with partial wetting of surfaces. The emphasis ofthis paper is on surfaces combining both This work was partially supported by the Office of Naval Research under Grant N00014-10-1-0934. Figure1.Apartialywetconcret pavement,waterspiledon wood, water stain on a cap, and coffee spilled on a carpet. dry and wet parts. Distinguishing between completely wet and dry surfaces in independent images requires accounting for the illumination variations in the scenes, and may be subject to increased ambiguity in the absence of context. For example, comparing an image of a dry T-shirt to an image of the same T-shirt taken out of a washing machine is a more challenging problem since the straightforward solution is to consider them as different colored T-shirts. However, the algorithms we develop in this paper apply to this scenario assuming illumination is the same in both images. Figure 1 shows examples we analyze: (a) partially wet concrete pavement, (b) water spilled on a piece of wood, (c) water stain on a cap, and (d) coffee spilled on a carpet. We assume that the wet and dry patches have been pre-segmented and focus on whether the dry patch can be synthesized to appear wet under unknown parameters employing a well-known optical model. There are several factors that determine the visual appearance of wet versus dry surfaces. Specifically: • The physical properties of the liquid involved. The translucence (or light absorption) of the liquid determines ifinterreflection occurs and is visually observed. Water is translucent, while paint is near opaque. The light absorption of the liquid as a function of wave2952 lengths affects the overall spectral appearance of the wet area. Water absorbs slightly more of the green and red wavelengths and less of the blue wavelength, while olive oil absorbs more of the blue wavelength and much less of the red and green wavelengths. • • • The size and shape of the liquid affect the optical properties of the scene. For example, liquid droplets create a complex optical phenomenon as the curvature of each droplet acts as a lens (e.g., a drop of water can operate as a magnifying lens as well as cause light dispersion). The illuminant contributes to the appearance of both the dry and wet patches since it determines the wavelengths that are reaching the scene and the absorptions of the surface and liquid. The liquid absorption rate of the material determines whether a thin film of liquid remains floating apart on top of the material surface. For example, some plastics or highly polished metals absorb very little liquid and therefore a wetting phenomenon without absorption occurs. Nevertheless, non-absorbed liquids do change the appearance of the surface as they form droplets. • Specular reflections may occur at parts of the wet surface and therefore mask the light refraction from air-toliquid and interreflections that occur within the liquidmaterial complex. In this paper we study the problem of determining if two patches within the same image (or two images taken under similar illumination conditions) can be explained as wet and dry instances of the same material given that the material, liquid and illumination are unknown. The paper’s contribution is proposing an algorithm for searching a high-dimensional space of possible liquids, material and imaging parameters to determine a plausible wetting process that explains the appearance differences between two patches. Beyond the basic aspects of the problem, the results are relevant to fundamental capabilities such as detection, segmentation and recognition. 2. Related Research Wet surfaces were considered first as an optics albedo measurement of various surfaces by Angstrom in 1925 [1]. The proposed model assumed that light reaching the observer is solely stemming from rays at or exceeding the critical angle and thus the model suggested less light than experimental data. Lekner and Dorf [3] expanded this model by accounting for the probability of internal reflections in the water film and the effect of the decrease of the relative refractive index at the liquid to material surface. Ther model was shown to agree more closely with experimental data. In computer graphics, Jensen et al. [5] rendered wet surfaces by combining a reflection model for surface water with subsurface scattering. Gu et al [6] observed empirically the process of surface drying of several materials but no physical model for drying was offered. There has been little interest in wet surfaces in computer vision. Mall and da Vitoria Lobo [4] adopted the Lekner and Dorf model [3] to convert a dry material into a wet appearance and vice versa. The algorithm was described for greyscale images and fixed physical parameters. This work forms the basis of our paper. Teshima and Saito [2] developed a temporal approach for detection of wet road surfaces based on the occurrence of specular reflections across multiple images. 3. Approach Given two patches, Pd presumed dry, and Pw possibly wet, the objective is to determine if a liquid of unknown properties can synthesize the dry patch so that it appears visually similar to the wet patch. We employ the term material to describe the surface that absorbs the thin film of liquid to create the wet patch. We leverage the optical model developed by [3] and used by [4], by formulating a search over the parameter space of possible materials and liquids. In this paper we focus on a partial set of liquid on ma- terial appearances. Specifically, we exclude specular reflections, non-absorbing materials, and liquid droplets. 3.1. Optics Model Figure 2 shows the basic model developed in [3]. A light ray entering the liquid film over the rough material surface with a probability of 1−Rl where Rl is the reflectance at the air-liquid interface. A fraction, a, ofthis light is absorbed by the material surface, and thus (1 Rl) ∗ (1 a) is reflected back to the liquid surface. Let p be the fraction of light reflected back into the liquid at the liquid-air surface. The total probability of absorption by the rough surface as this process repeats is described by − − A=(1−Rl)[a+a(1−a)p+a(1−a)2p2+...]=1(−1p−(R1−l)aa) .(1) Lekner and Dorf [3] show that p can be written in terms of the liquid ’s refractive index nl and the average isotropically illuminated surface R: p = 1 −n1l2[1 − R(nl)] where (2) R(n) (n > 1): R(n) = 3n32(n++2n1)+21 −(2nn23+(n12)+2(n2n2−−11)) + n(2n(2n−2+1)21)log(n) −n2(n(2n2+−1)13)2log(nn(n−+11)) (3) 2953 Figure2.Thligta1−rR-ltoiqu(d1−Ral()1n−adliqu1(−-Rlt1()o−-asp)urfcemodl. Lekner and Dorff [3] proposed that the light absorption rates of the dry and wet materials are different, and that the wet material will always have a higher absorption rate. Let ad and aw be the light absorption rates of the dry and wet materials respectively, so that aw > ad. Thus the albedo values for the dry and wet surfaces are 1−ad and A = 1 aw, respectively, assuming isotropic illumination. Let nr be the refractive index of the material. For small absorptions, ad ≈ 1 and aw ≈ 1 and therefore − R(nr), aw ≈ − R(nr/nl) ad[1 − R(nr/nl)]/[1 − R(nr)] while for large absorptions aw ≈ the two values can be expressed as ad. An interpolation of aw= ad(1 − ad)11 − − R R(n(rn/rn)l)+ ad 3.2. Imaging Model (4) (5) Lekner and Dorff [3] and Mall and da Vitoria Lobo [4] focused on the albedo change between dry and wet surfaces. The model is suitable for estimating reflectance of a single wavelength but requires extension to aggregated wavelengths captured by greyscale or color images. In [4], the model was applied to greyscale images where the true albedo was approximated by using the maximum observed brightness in the patch. This assumes that micro-facet orientations of the material are widely distributed. Color images present two additional issues: cameras (1) integrate light across spectral zones, and (2) apply image processing, enhancement and compression to the raw images. As a result, the input image is a function of the actual physical process but may not be quantitatively accurate. Our objective is to estimate the albedo of the homogeneous dry patch, Pd, for each of the RGB channels (overlooking the real spectral wavelengths), despite unknown imaging parameters. It is critical to note that the camera acquires an image that is a function of the albedo, surface normal and illuminant attributes (direction, intensity and emitted wavelengths) at each pixel, so that estimating the true physical albedo is challenging in the absence of information about the scene. In the following we first describe a representation of the relative albedo in RGB and then describe how it is re-formulated to derive possible absolute albedo values. Let the albedo of the homogeneous dry material be AR, AG , AB with respect to the RGB channels. Then, AR = 1 − aR, AG = 1 − aG, AB = 1 − aB (6) where aR, aG , aB are the absorption rates of light in the red, green and blue channels, respectively. Since the value of each absorption parameter is between 0 and 1, it is possible to search this three dimensional space in small increments of aR, aG , aB values. However, these absorption rates are confounded with the variable surface normals across the patch as we consider RGB values. Instead, we observe that the colors of pixels reflect, approximately, the relative absorption rates of red, green and blue. For example, a grey pixel indicates equal absorption in red, green and blue regardless of the level of the greyness. The surface normal contributes to a scalar that modifies the amount of light captured by the camera, but does not alter the relative albedos. Therefore, we can parametrize the albedo values as AR ∗ (1, rGR, rBR), where rGR and rBR are the relative albedo values green-to-red and blue-to-red, respectively. This parametrization does not, theoretically, change due to variation in surface normals. Specifically, consider a homogeneous patch of constant albedo but variable surface normals, and assuming a Lambertian model, the image reflectance can be expressed as IR(x, y) = AR IG (x, y) = AG IB (x, y) = AB ∗ ∗ ∗ (N(x, y) · S(x, y)) (N(x, y) · S(x, y)) (N(x, y) · S(x, y)) (7) where N(x, y) and S(x, y) are the surface normal and the illuminant direction at (x, y), respectively (S(x, y) = S for a distant point light source). The two ratios rGR = IG/IR and rBR = IB/IR are constant for all pixels (x, y) independent of the dot product of the normal and illumination vectors (N(x, y) · S(x, y)) (since they cancel out). In practice, however, due to imaging artifacts, the ratios are more defuse and therefore multiple ratios may be detectable over a patch. Given a dry patch, Pd, we compute a set of (rGR, rBR) pairs. If the patch were perfectly uniform (in terms of surface normals), a single pair will be found, but for complex surfaces there may be several such pairs. We histogram the normalized G/R and B/R values to compute these pairs. Let Sd denote the set of these ratios computed over Pd. As a result of the above parametrization, the red albedo, AR, is unknown and it will be searched for optimal fit and AG and AB are computed from the Sd ratios. Mall and da Vitoria Lobo [4] proposed that assuming a rough surface, the maximum reflected brightness, Imax, can be used as a denominator to normalize all values and generate relative albedo values. In reality, even under these assumptions, Imax is the lower-bound value that should be 2954 used as denominator to infer the albedo of the patch. Moreover, the values acquired by the camera are subject to automatic gain, white balance and other processing that tend to change numerical values. For example, a surface with albedo equal to 1, may have a value of 180 (out of 256 levels), and therefore mislead the recovery of the true surface albedo (i.e., suggesting a lower albedo than 1). The optics framework requires absolute albedo values to predict the wet albedo of the surface. Therefore, the reflectance values should be normalized with respect to an unknown Rwhite ≥ Imax (typically) which represents the absolute value that corresponds to the intensity of a fully reflective surface under the same imaging conditions (including unknown camera imaging parameters, and a normal and illuminant dot product equal to 1.0). Note that for an ideal image acquisition an albedo of 1 corresponds to Rwhite = 256, but in practice Rwhite can be lower (e.g., for white balance) or higher than 256 (e.g., camera gain). Determining Rwhite involves a search for the best value in the range Imax to IUpperBound. While IUpperBound can be chosen as a large number, the computational cost is prohibitive. Instead, we observe that if we assume that the patch includes all possible surface normal orientations, then the maximum intensity, Imax corresponds to (N(x, y) · S(x, y)) being 1.0 while minimum intensity Imin corresponds to (N(x, y) · S(x, y)) near zero, for the unknown albedo A (see Equation 7). Let denote a vector of the values of all the normals multiplied by the illuminant direction (these values span the range 0..1). Therefore, the brightness of an object with an albedo of 1in these unknown imaging conditions (and including the camera’s image processing) can be computed as n IUpperBound = 256 ∗ max(A ∗ n) + 256 ∗ max ((1 − A) ∗ n) (8) where 256 is the camera’s intensity output range (assuming no saturation occurred). This is equal to IUpperBound = Imax + (256 − Imin) (9) Imax and Imin may be subject to noise and imaging factors that may create outliers, so we approximate the intensity values as a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation σ and assign Imax Imin = 4 ∗ σ cropping the tail values and capturing near 97% of the distribution, so that IUpperBound = 256 + 4 ∗ σ. This gaussian assumption is reasonable for a rough surface but for a flat surface, σ is near zero, and therefore we use IUpperBound = 256 + 100 as an arbitrary value. Note that IUpperBound reduces the range of the search for the best Rwhite and not the quality of the results. We use the largest value of IUpperBound computed for each of the RGB channels for all searches. Imax may be subject to automatic gain amplification during acquisition. Therefore, the range of values for Rwhite is expanded to be from 0.75 ∗ Imax to IUpperBound. The choice of 0.75 is arbitrary since it assumes that the gain is limited to 33% of the true values, and one could choose a different values. Given a pixel from a dry patch, Pd, we can convert its value to a wet pixel − Pw (x, y) = Pd(x, y) + ((1 − ad) − (1− aw)) ∗ Rwhite (10) where aw is calculated using Equation 5 given a specific ad. Equation 10 is applied to each of the RGB channels using the respective parameters. 3.3. Liquid Spectral Absorption The model described so far assumed that the spectral absorption of the liquid film itself is near zero across all wavelengths. This is a reasonable assumption for water since it can be treated as translucent given the negligible thickness of the liquid present at the surface. We next consider water-based liquids that have different absorption rates across wavelengths such as coffee and wine (even at negligible thickness). We assume a refractive index that is equal to water, however we assume that qr , qg , qb represent corrective absorption rates in RGB, respectively. These corrective rates modify the darkening due to water-based wetness. The real liquid absorption rates are computed as Lr = qr Lg = awg Lb = awb − awr − awr + qg + (11) qb where awr, awg, awb are the respective wet surface absorptions for red, green and blue, respectively (for water). Equation 10 is modified to account for the liquid absorption rates: Pw (x ,y) = Pd (x ,y) + (( 1 − ad ) − (1 − aw ) − ( 1 q) ) ∗ − Rw hite (12) where the respective parameters for each of the RGB channels are used. Note that Equation 11 computes relative ab- sorption rates with respect to qr, so that we recover only the differences in absorptions between the RGB channels. Nevertheless, these relative absorptions are informative and sufficient since the absolute values are intertwined with the intensity of the illuminant. For example, adding a constant absorption of 0.1 to each of Lr, Lg , Lb is equal to decrease in reflected light equal to a 10% loss of illuminant intensity. Absent prior information, we search the full range of possible values between 0 1.0 for each variable. In practice, we can, in most cases, limit the search to values between 0.0 0.5 since higher values are likely, when combined with the increased absorption due to wetting, to drive total light absorption to 1.0 which represents a black object. In cases where the Pw shows complete absorption of a wavelength (e.g., a thick layer of wine or coffee), the 0..1 range is searched. Moreover, values that represent equal absorptions, qr ≈ qg ≈ qb are unnecessary to consider since − − 2955 they are functionally equivalent to water (but they do contribute uniform darkening in all channels that is automatically captured in the computation of the absorption values of the material). The search is conducted in small increments of 0.02. 3.4. Similarity Metric The synthesized wet patch Ps is scored against Pw. A useful similarity metric is the well-known Earth Mover’s Distance [7] (EMD). The distance is computed between the size-normalized histograms of the two patches. The smaller the distance, the closer the appearance between the synthesized and true wet patches. Given that these patches are typically taken from different parts of the same image, we assume that the dry and wet patches are of the same material as well as have similar surface normal distributions. If the distributions of surface normals between the two patches violate this assumption, we have a suboptimal similarity metric. Devising a metric that accounts for different and unknown distributions of surface normal remains an open problem. Note that EMD is not suitable for comparing different materials (e.g., if the wet and dry material are of two different wood species). 4. Search Space We summarize the search parameters to determine the best synthesis, Ps, of Pd given Pw. The refractive index of the material, nr is unknown. Refractive indices of materials vary widely, with air being near 1.0 and the highest measured material (a synthetic material) is 38.6. Common materials, however, tend to fall between 1−5.0. As a result, we perform a search on all values of nr between 1.1 − 5.0 in increments of 0.1 (note that if we assume the material to have higher refractive index than water, the search can be made between 1.5 −5.0). Note that nr is dependent on light wavelengths (i.e., light wavelengths have slightly different speeds in the same medium), but accounting for this variation in the search process is computationally expensive. Therefore, we use the same nr for the three channels. We assume the liquid to be water-like, so that nl is known. Specifically, we assume that nl = 1.331 for the red channel, nl = 1.336 for the green channel, and nl = 1.343 for the blue channel. This assumption is suitable for most water-based liquids such as coffee, wine, etc. (in practice, the ethanol in wine increases the refractive index slightly, and coffee particles increase it upto 1.5). Other liquids, such as oil, have different refractive indices, but since we assume no prior information, we employ the water refractive indices even when oil may be involved. The absorption rate of the dry material, ad, is unknown and falls in the range 0 − 1.0. The discussion in subsection 3.2 uses the albedo AR as a variable and derives the green and blue albedo values, and thus their absorptions accordingly. Therefore, we perform a search over all values between 0.05 − 0.95 in 0.05 increments for adR . The values Imin, Imax and IUpperBound are pre-computed and then a search for optimal Rwhite is computed in increments of 20 units for the range 0.75 ∗ Imax and IUpperBound. Depending on the expected liquid, we can limit the search to water, or search in a reduced 3D space of liquid correction absorption rates, qr, qg , qb, as discussed in section 3.3. Algorithm 1, below, is for the case of water, but can be adjusted for an unknown liquid.

Experiments We conducted experiments on three data sets: collected by us, collected from the web, and a controlled set of drying objects collected and described in Gu et al. [6]. The experiments answer the question: given a dry patch, Pd and a patch likely to be wet Pw, what are the best parameters that make Pd look most similar to Pw? The answer allows uncovering physical information about the liquid and the material which is valuable for computer vision. The answer may also indicate that no wetting process can make Pd look like Pw, which is also valuable since it suggests that the two patches differ in more significant ways. Note that we focus on applying a physically-motivated model to the problem and not an image-based appearance transformation. One could pose the problem differently by computing a transformation (that has nothing to do with wetting) that maximizes the similarity between a transformed Pd and Pw. But such transformation does not uncover information about the physical process that is involved and is ultimately less insightful. The patches Pd and Pw are manually delineated. The border area between the patches is neither fully dry or wet. Therefore, the border area is rarely synthesized properly. We exclude these boundary pixels from EMD computation between Ps and Pw . 2956 Empirically, we observed that EMD distances below 20 indicate close resemblance and below 10 are near identical images. Note that EMD does not capture the spatial color variations (i.e., texture differences). In all figures below, the numeric values show the EMD distance, followed by (nr, Rwhite), the next row shows the respective albedo values AR, AG, AB. In the images of the colored liquids, the third row shows the albedo of the liquid ALR, ALG, ALB . Figure 3 shows the results of the closest synthetic wetting of a dry material (images taken from [6]). These images were taken under controlled illumination but at different times, as the initially wet material dried. The top row shows the dry materials, the middle row shows the real wet material, both are provided by [6]. The bottom row of images shows the computed wet materials using our algorithm. Below each image we provide the physical parameters that our algorithm uncovered, assuming the liquid is water. Note that most of the true wet images have some specular reflections that are not generated by our model. The materials are (left to right), rock, wood, cloth, wood, felt, paper, cardboard, brick, wood, cloth, cloth and granite. The results indicate that wood is the least successfully analyzed material. The wet wood has increased spectral divergence in colors beyond what the dry material exhibits and therefore does not appear to be correctly captured by the model. Specifically, the wet wood appears to absorb more of the blue and green light relative to red, and therefore the wood is tinted brown-red. We discuss this issue further in Section 6. Figure 4 shows images we acquired of different wet materials. From left to right all images have a darker wet patch: yellow paper (wet on the right side), paper towel, large area of a cap, a smaller part of the same cap, blue paper, orange fleece material, grey/blue paper, green paper, orange fabric, and grey/blue fabric. The distances are largest for the complete green cap and blue paper. The reason is that the surface normal distributions vary between the wet and dry patches, and therefore the EMD is not a suitable metric (see discussion in subsection 3.4). The smaller part of the cap shows very good synthesis of the dry patch. Figure 5 shows a collection of images of water-based wetting of different materials downloaded from the web. From left to right, raster scan, partially wet: two cardboard images, concrete, yellow brick, three types of wood, blue fabric, two images of different types of sand, red tile, red brick, blue/green brick, striped shirt and grey pants. Two of the wood images show the largest distances and a discussion of likely reasons is provided in Section 6. The rest of images are close to the real wet areas in each image ignoring the borders between patches. Figure 5 shows a collection of images downloaded from the web ofnon-water wetting. From left to right, raster scan, partially wet: coffee on carpet, coffee on wood, wine on carpet, olive oil on humus, olive oil on wood, tea on fabric, coffee on fabric, two images of coffee on carpet, wine on tile, wine on carpet, wine on granite, same image but applying a water model, wine on carpet, coffee on plastic table cloth, coffee on carpet, coffee on shirt, same image but applying a water model, wine on yellow napkin, and soy sauce on yellow napkin (the last two images are acquired by us). The liquid color is rendered with intensity that is close to the wet area. The wine on granite and coffee on shirt are used to also demonstrate the results of the water model as opposed to accounting for different spectral absorptions. Overall the distances are low with exception to the olive oil on wood and wine on white carpet (middle of the bottom group). The olive oil on wood maybe related to explanations in Section 6 while the wine on carpet shows marked difference in surface normals between the dry and wet patches (the wet patches are in focus while the dry patch is blurred). 6. Open Challenges The experiments indicated that in some images of wet wood, the model is not accurate. Figure 7 shows an image of an outdoor deck, a part of a wetted area used for an experiment, and the synthesized dry patch using our model. The dry wood appears nearly perfectly grey, while the wet wood is brown. The wet pixels show high absorption of green relative to red, and even higher absorption of blue relative to green and red. The model does not predict this result given that the liquid is water. A similar phenomenon was observed in some experiments in Figures 3 and 5. We suggest two conjectures as to why this occurs. The first has to do with image acquisition, and suggests that perhaps the camera is overstating the amount of blue and green light reflected at the dry patch. The second is that these woods and their resultant images have a more complex wetting process. Specifically, it is possible that this wood is composed of 2 layers, the first is very thin and tends to have only a hint of the spectral properties of the wood, and the second layer reflects the full spectral attributes of the wood. The top layer may come to exist due to environmental degradation or dust, but may not exist in freshly cut wood. For the dry wood in Figure 7 the reflectance is mostly the result of reflection from the top layer, while upon wetting, the second layer is reached by the water and thus it be- the dominant source of reflectance. Unfortunately it remains an open challenge to explain these deviations from the model. Differences in the distributions of the surface normals between the dry and wet patches make it harder to determine similarity (even if a different metric than EMD is used). This is general computer vision problem that is not specific to wetting, but is made more challenging by the complexity of the wetting process. comes 2957 8.3 (2.8,195) (0.90,0.89,0.87) 8.8(5.0,182) (0.05,0.03,0.02) 20.2 (2.1,155) 25.0(1.8,160) 6.4 (0.30,0.20,0.15) (0.10,0.08,0.07) (5.0,233) (0.05,0.05,0.05) 16.4 (5.0,162) (0.60,0.61,0.62) 9.2(5.0,247) 3.0(5.0,154) 24. 1(5.0,146) (0.15,0.14,0.12) (0.10,0.09,0.09) (0.10,0.09,0.08) 1.5 (4.8,121) (0.25,0.27,0.21) 13.3(2.7,131) 7.0(3.8,157) (0.15,0. 15,0.15) (0.30,0.29,0.28) Figure 3.

Summary In this paper we investigated the problem of visual appearance change as liquids and rough surfaces interact. The problem assumes that two patches, the first is known to be dry and the second is possibly wet are given. Liquid attributes that are close to water, but also allow for varying absorption rates across spectral wavelengths allow accounting for unknown liquids suchs as coffee, wine and oil. Our experiments indicate an ability to explain wetting effects in different materials and under unknown imaging conditions. References [1] A. Angstrom.

<p>Author: Che-Han Chang, Min-Chun Hu, Wen-Huang Cheng, Yung-Yu Chuang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new projection model for mapping a hemisphere to a plane. Such a model can be useful for viewing wide-angle images. Our model consists of two steps. In the first step, the hemisphere is projected onto a swung surface constructed by a circular profile and a rounded rectangular trajectory. The second step maps the projected image on the swung surface onto the image plane through the perspective projection. We also propose a method for automatically determining proper parameters for the projection model based on image content. The proposed model has several advantages. It is simple, efficient and easy to control. Most importantly, it makes a better compromise between distortion minimization and line preserving than popular projection models, such as stereographic and Pannini projections. Experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p><p>5 0.69514459 <a title="343-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Subpixel_Scanning_Invariant_to_Indirect_Lighting_Using_Quadratic_Code_Length.html">407 iccv-2013-Subpixel Scanning Invariant to Indirect Lighting Using Quadratic Code Length</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolas Martin, Vincent Couture, Sébastien Roy</p><p>Abstract: We present a scanning method that recovers dense subpixel camera-projector correspondence without requiring any photometric calibration nor preliminary knowledge of their relative geometry. Subpixel accuracy is achieved by considering several zero-crossings defined by the difference between pairs of unstructured patterns. We use gray-level band-pass white noise patterns that increase robustness to indirect lighting and scene discontinuities. Simulated and experimental results show that our method recovers scene geometry with high subpixel precision, and that it can handle many challenges of active reconstruction systems. We compare our results to state of the art methods such as micro phase shifting and modulated phase shifting.</p><p>6 0.68331856 <a title="343-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Elastic_Fragments_for_Dense_Scene_Reconstruction.html">139 iccv-2013-Elastic Fragments for Dense Scene Reconstruction</a></p>

<p>Author: Anne Jordt-Sedlazeck, Reinhard Koch</p><p>Abstract: In underwater environments, cameras need to be confined in an underwater housing, viewing the scene through a piece of glass. In case of flat port underwater housings, light rays entering the camera housing are refracted twice, due to different medium densities of water, glass, and air. This causes the usually linear rays of light to bend and the commonly used pinhole camera model to be invalid. When using the pinhole camera model without explicitly modeling refraction in Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods, a systematic model error occurs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a system for computing camera path and 3D points with explicit incorporation of refraction using new methods for pose estimation. Additionally, a new error function is introduced for non-linear optimization, especially bundle adjustment. The proposed method allows to increase reconstruction accuracy and is evaluated in a set of experiments, where the proposed method’s performance is compared to SfM with the perspective camera model.</p><p>2 0.79470104 <a title="343-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Action_Recognition_with_Actons.html">38 iccv-2013-Action Recognition with Actons</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Baoyuan Wang, Xiaokang Yang, Wenjun Zhang, Zhuowen Tu</p><p>Abstract: With the improved accessibility to an exploding amount of video data and growing demands in a wide range of video analysis applications, video-based action recognition/classification becomes an increasingly important task in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a two-layer structure for action recognition to automatically exploit a mid-level “acton ” representation. The weakly-supervised actons are learned via a new max-margin multi-channel multiple instance learning framework, which can capture multiple mid-level action concepts simultaneously. The learned actons (with no requirement for detailed manual annotations) observe theproperties ofbeing compact, informative, discriminative, and easy to scale. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness ofapplying the learned actons in our two-layer structure, and show the state-ofthe-art recognition performance on two challenging action datasets, i.e., Youtube and HMDB51.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.79409254 <a title="343-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Real-World_Normal_Map_Capture_for_Nearly_Flat_Reflective_Surfaces.html">343 iccv-2013-Real-World Normal Map Capture for Nearly Flat Reflective Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Bastien Jacquet, Christian Häne, Kevin Köser, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Although specular objects have gained interest in recent years, virtually no approaches exist for markerless reconstruction of reflective scenes in the wild. In this work, we present a practical approach to capturing normal maps in real-world scenes using video only. We focus on nearly planar surfaces such as windows, facades from glass or metal, or frames, screens and other indoor objects and show how normal maps of these can be obtained without the use of an artificial calibration object. Rather, we track the reflections of real-world straight lines, while moving with a hand-held or vehicle-mounted camera in front of the object. In contrast to error-prone local edge tracking, we obtain the reflections by a robust, global segmentation technique of an ortho-rectified 3D video cube that also naturally allows efficient user interaction. Then, at each point of the reflective surface, the resulting 2D-curve to 3D-line correspondence provides a novel quadratic constraint on the local surface normal. This allows to globally solve for the shape by integrability and smoothness constraints and easily supports the usage of multiple lines. We demonstrate the technique on several objects and facades.</p><p>4 0.7933805 <a title="343-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Kneip, Simon Lynen</p><p>Abstract: This work makes use of a novel, recently proposed epipolar constraint for computing the relative pose between two calibrated images. By enforcing the coplanarity of epipolar plane normal vectors, it constrains the three degrees of freedom of the relative rotation between two camera views directly—independently of the translation. The present paper shows how the approach can be extended to n points, and translated into an efficient eigenvalue minimization over the three rotational degrees of freedom. Each iteration in the non-linear optimization has constant execution time, independently of the number of features. Two global optimization approaches are proposed. The first one consists of an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt scheme with randomized initial value, which already leads to stable and accurate results. The second scheme consists of a globally optimal branch-and-bound algorithm based on a bound on the eigenvalue variation derived from symmetric eigenvalue-perturbation theory. Analysis of the cost function reveals insights into the nature of a specific relative pose problem, and outlines the complexity under different conditions. The algorithm shows state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. essential-matrix based solutions, and a frameto-frame application to a video sequence immediately leads to an alternative, real-time visual odometry solution. Note: All algorithms in this paper are made available in the OpenGV library.

<p>Author: Ivan Sipiran, Benjamin Bustos</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical method for finding correspondences in non-rigid shapes. We propose a new representation for 3D meshes: the decomposition tree. This structure characterizes the recursive decomposition process of a mesh into regions of interest and keypoints. The internal nodes contain regions of interest (which may be recursively decomposed) and the leaf nodes contain the keypoints to be matched. We also propose a hierarchical matching algorithm that performs in a level-wise manner. The matching process is guided by the similarity between regions in high levels of the tree, until reaching the keypoints stored in the leaves. This allows us to reduce the search space of correspondences, making also the matching process efficient. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using the SHREC’2010 robust correspondence benchmark. In addition, we show that our results outperform the state of the art.</p><p>6 0.73103547 <a title="343-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-STAR3D%3A_Simultaneous_Tracking_and_Reconstruction_of_3D_Objects_Using_RGB-D_Data.html">366 iccv-2013-STAR3D: Simultaneous Tracking and Reconstruction of 3D Objects Using RGB-D Data</a></p>

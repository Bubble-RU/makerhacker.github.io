</p><p>8 Introduction With the development of harmonic analysis [4, 3], sparse models have received a lot of attention in recent years. [sent-12, score-0.169]
</p><p>9 The universal sparsity in real applications enables us to achieve good performancein many areas such as compressive sensing [3], image recovery [6] and classification [29]. [sent-13, score-0.118]
</p><p>10 Specifically, learning a sparse prototype model (or “dictionary”) [15, 21, 6] to represent training data set is often applied as a first step. [sent-15, score-0.211]
</p><p>11 The advantages of dictionary learning over pre-defined fixed bases, such as DCT and FFT, have been shown in many applications [8, 23, 6]. [sent-16, score-0.472]
</p><p>12 Recent studies [26] also provided theoretical support for exact recovery of all codewords under that condition of sufficient sparsity and . [sent-17, score-0.338]
</p><p>13 Most sparse coding methods [27, 15, 6, 17] make a basic assumption that the observed signals consist of a sparse linear combination of codewords plus dense Gaussian noises of small variation. [sent-21, score-0.952]
</p><p>14 However, though working well generally, this assumption does not hold in case oflarge corruptions and outliers, which is common in practice. [sent-22, score-0.145]
</p><p>15 For example, in face recognition, a sample face image can be considered as corrupted if the person accidentally wears sunglasses. [sent-23, score-0.287]
</p><p>16 As shown in [29], if the training data is clean, corrupted test-  ing data can be handled by using sparse residual. [sent-24, score-0.314]
</p><p>17 This robust method demonstrated very encouraging face recognition results [29, 3 1, 12]. [sent-25, score-0.143]
</p><p>18 In practice, it may be inevitable to include corrupted sample and outliers in addition to dense Gaussian noises in the training data. [sent-26, score-0.497]
</p><p>19 , xkA is person A accidentally wearing sunglasses, then it can be very ambiguous to recognize a corrupted input, e. [sent-40, score-0.241]
</p><p>20 It is clear that noisy and corrupted training data will largely result in low quality dictionary if learned by existing methods. [sent-43, score-0.61]
</p><p>21 As the data noise come multiple sources with different characteristics, we call this issue the residual modality problem. [sent-44, score-0.425]
</p><p>22 This also emerges in many other vision tasks, such as removing salt and pepper noises, and handling artificially added texts and other outliers in images. [sent-45, score-0.261]
</p><p>23 In order to address this issue, we propose a robust dictionary learning approach based on the decomposition of the reconstructive residual into two modalities: one for dense small Gaussian noises an the other for large sparse outliers. [sent-46, score-1.473]
</p><p>24 We can have different residual penalty for different modalities. [sent-47, score-0.389]
</p><p>25 This paper provides a coordinate descent solution for robust dictionary learning, an online acceleration method, and its convergence property. [sent-48, score-0.621]
</p><p>26 This new approach allows us to learn a robust dictionary and identify outlier training data. [sent-49, score-0.553]
</p><p>27 In addition, our further study reveals a very interesting con-  2216  nection between this source decomposition approach and the “partial dictionary update” approach. [sent-50, score-0.597]
</p><p>28 This residual decomposition method is an explicit way to handle corrupted data in dictionary learning. [sent-51, score-1.002]
</p><p>29 Moreover, we also propose an alternative that uses robust functions on reconstructive residual, which is an implicit means for corrupted data. [sent-52, score-0.318]
</p><p>30 Experiments on synthetic dataset, texture synthesis, and image denoising show that our model is able to achieve quite satisfactory results without using much heuristics. [sent-54, score-0.208]

</p><p>35 Recently, a lot of work has been done to improve the traditional dictionary learning model in Eqn (1) for specific tasks. [sent-84, score-0.502]

</p><p>37 Zhou [33] studies the influence of residual modality parameter settings and suggests that a good estimation ofnoise level can enhance the performance of sparse coding. [sent-93, score-0.565]
</p><p>38 In contrast to these methods, we propose to decompose the residual into two sources rather than one Gaussian or Laplacian. [sent-94, score-0.373]
</p><p>39 The empirical residual distribution, its Gaussian and Laplacian fitting is shown in blue, red and green. [sent-104, score-0.379]
</p><p>40 We can see clearly that the true residual has smoother p. [sent-105, score-0.383]

</p><p>49 The non-convexity of dictionary learning method in Eqn (3) requires a good initialization; fixing DNoise reasonably avoids local minima and enables us to obtain a better numerical solution. [sent-154, score-0.507]
</p><p>50 (2) Fixing sparse coefficients Ξ and α, we update D: Dˆ = argmDin||X − Ξ − Dα||2F  s. [sent-160, score-0.248]
</p><p>51 Three reasonable assumptions have been made in [17]: (A) compact support1; (B) strictly convex quadratic surrogate functions2; (C) unique sparse coding solution3. [sent-174, score-0.362]
</p><p>52 We keep (A)(B) unchanged and modify (C) slightly as: (C’) Unique Sparse Solution: the informative codewords {d1, d2, . [sent-175, score-0.302]

</p><p>59 If we further regard the error source decomposition model as φ(s) = inξf(s − ξ)2+ λ|ξ| then the shape of φ(s) is very similar to the shape of the robust function. [sent-213, score-0.189]

<p>Author: Chenglong Bao, Jian-Feng Cai, Hui Ji</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, how to learn a dictionary from input images for sparse modelling has been one very active topic in image processing and recognition. Most existing dictionary learning methods consider an over-complete dictionary, e.g. the K-SVD method. Often they require solving some minimization problem that is very challenging in terms of computational feasibility and efficiency. However, if the correlations among dictionary atoms are not well constrained, the redundancy of the dictionary does not necessarily improve the performance of sparse coding. This paper proposed a fast orthogonal dictionary learning method for sparse image representation. With comparable performance on several image restoration tasks, the proposed method is much more computationally efficient than the over-complete dictionary based learning methods.</p><p>3 0.39561161 <a title="354-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Semi-supervised_Robust_Dictionary_Learning_via_Efficient_l-Norms_Minimization.html">384 iccv-2013-Semi-supervised Robust Dictionary Learning via Efficient l-Norms Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Weidong Cai, Heng Huang</p><p>Abstract: Representing the raw input of a data set by a set of relevant codes is crucial to many computer vision applications. Due to the intrinsic sparse property of real-world data, dictionary learning, in which the linear decomposition of a data point uses a set of learned dictionary bases, i.e., codes, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, traditional dictionary learning methods suffer from three weaknesses: sensitivity to noisy and outlier samples, difficulty to determine the optimal dictionary size, and incapability to incorporate supervision information.

<p>Author: Chen-Kuo Chiang, Te-Feng Su, Chih Yen, Shang-Hong Lai</p><p>Abstract: We present a multi-attributed dictionary learning algorithm for sparse coding. Considering training samples with multiple attributes, a new distance matrix is proposed by jointly incorporating data and attribute similarities. Then, an objective function is presented to learn categorydependent dictionaries that are compact (closeness of dictionary atoms based on data distance and attribute similarity), reconstructive (low reconstruction error with correct dictionary) and label-consistent (encouraging the labels of dictionary atoms to be similar). We have demonstrated our algorithm on action classification and face recognition tasks on several publicly available datasets. Experimental results with improved performance over previous dictionary learning methods are shown to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>5 0.25884262 <a title="354-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Hierarchical_Joint_Max-Margin_Learning_of_Mid_and_Top_Level_Representations_for_Visual_Recognition.html">197 iccv-2013-Hierarchical Joint Max-Margin Learning of Mid and Top Level Representations for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Hans Lobel, René Vidal, Alvaro Soto</p><p>Abstract: Currently, Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) and part-based methods are the most popular approaches for visual recognition. In both cases, a mid-level representation is built on top of low-level image descriptors and top-level classifiers use this mid-level representation to achieve visual recognition. While in current part-based approaches, mid- and top-level representations are usually jointly trained, this is not the usual case for BoVW schemes. A main reason for this is the complex data association problem related to the usual large dictionary size needed by BoVW approaches. As a further observation, typical solutions based on BoVW and part-based representations are usually limited to extensions of binary classification schemes, a strategy that ignores relevant correlations among classes. In this work we propose a novel hierarchical approach to visual recognition based on a BoVW scheme that jointly learns suitable midand top-level representations. Furthermore, using a maxmargin learning framework, the proposed approach directly handles the multiclass case at both levels of abstraction. We test our proposed method using several popular bench- mark datasets. As our main result, we demonstrate that, by coupling learning of mid- and top-level representations, the proposed approach fosters sharing of discriminative visual words among target classes, being able to achieve state-ofthe-art recognition performance using far less visual words than previous approaches.</p><p>6 0.24678719 <a title="354-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Group_Sparsity_and_Geometry_Constrained_Dictionary_Learning_for_Action_Recognition_from_Depth_Maps.html">188 iccv-2013-Group Sparsity and Geometry Constrained Dictionary Learning for Action Recognition from Depth Maps</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhuoyuan Chen, Ying Wu</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity models have recently shown great promise in many vision tasks. Using a learned dictionary in sparsity models can in general outperform predefined bases in clean data. In practice, both training and testing data may be corrupted and contain noises and outliers. Although recent studies attempted to cope with corrupted data and achieved encouraging results in testing phase, how to handle corruption in training phase still remains a very difficult problem. In contrast to most existing methods that learn the dictionaryfrom clean data, this paper is targeted at handling corruptions and outliers in training data for dictionary learning. We propose a general method to decompose the reconstructive residual into two components: a non-sparse component for small universal noises and a sparse component for large outliers, respectively. In addition, , further analysis reveals the connection between our approach and the “partial” dictionary learning approach, updating only part of the prototypes (or informative codewords) with remaining (or noisy codewords) fixed.

<p>Author: Chenglong Bao, Jian-Feng Cai, Hui Ji</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, how to learn a dictionary from input images for sparse modelling has been one very active topic in image processing and recognition. Most existing dictionary learning methods consider an over-complete dictionary, e.g. the K-SVD method. Often they require solving some minimization problem that is very challenging in terms of computational feasibility and efficiency. However, if the correlations among dictionary atoms are not well constrained, the redundancy of the dictionary does not necessarily improve the performance of sparse coding. This paper proposed a fast orthogonal dictionary learning method for sparse image representation. With comparable performance on several image restoration tasks, the proposed method is much more computationally efficient than the over-complete dictionary based learning methods.</p><p>3 0.92935735 <a title="354-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Semi-supervised_Robust_Dictionary_Learning_via_Efficient_l-Norms_Minimization.html">384 iccv-2013-Semi-supervised Robust Dictionary Learning via Efficient l-Norms Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Weidong Cai, Heng Huang</p><p>Abstract: Representing the raw input of a data set by a set of relevant codes is crucial to many computer vision applications. Due to the intrinsic sparse property of real-world data, dictionary learning, in which the linear decomposition of a data point uses a set of learned dictionary bases, i.e., codes, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, traditional dictionary learning methods suffer from three weaknesses: sensitivity to noisy and outlier samples, difficulty to determine the optimal dictionary size, and incapability to incorporate supervision information.

<p>Author: Zhaowen Wang, Jianchao Yang, Nasser Nasrabadi, Thomas Huang</p><p>Abstract: Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) is a powerful tool in distinguishing signal categories which lie on different subspaces. Despite its wide application to visual recognition tasks, current understanding of SRC is solely based on a reconstructive perspective, which neither offers any guarantee on its classification performance nor provides any insight on how to design a discriminative dictionary for SRC. In this paper, we present a novel perspective towards SRC and interpret it as a margin classifier. The decision boundary and margin of SRC are analyzed in local regions where the support of sparse code is stable. Based on the derived margin, we propose a hinge loss function as the gauge for the classification performance of SRC. A stochastic gradient descent algorithm is implemented to maximize the margin of SRC and obtain more discriminative dictionaries. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting classification performance and improving dictionary quality over reconstructive ones. Classification results competitive with other state-ofthe-art sparse coding methods are reported on several data sets.</p><p>5 0.8168363 <a title="354-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Example-Based_Super-Resolution.html">51 iccv-2013-Anchored Neighborhood Regression for Fast Example-Based Super-Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Radu Timofte, Vincent De_Smet, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Recently there have been significant advances in image upscaling or image super-resolution based on a dictionary of low and high resolution exemplars. The running time of the methods is often ignored despite the fact that it is a critical factor for real applications. This paper proposes fast super-resolution methods while making no compromise on quality. First, we support the use of sparse learned dictionaries in combination with neighbor embedding methods. In this case, the nearest neighbors are computed using the correlation with the dictionary atoms rather than the Euclidean distance. Moreover, we show that most of the current approaches reach top performance for the right parameters. Second, we show that using global collaborative coding has considerable speed advantages, reducing the super-resolution mapping to a precomputed projective matrix. Third, we propose the anchored neighborhood regression. That is to anchor the neighborhood embedding of a low resolution patch to the nearest atom in the dictionary and to precompute the corresponding embedding matrix. These proposals are contrasted with current state-of- the-art methods on standard images. We obtain similar or improved quality and one or two orders of magnitude speed improvements.</p><p>6 0.79771531 <a title="354-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-attributed_Dictionary_Learning_for_Sparse_Coding.html">276 iccv-2013-Multi-attributed Dictionary Learning for Sparse Coding</a></p>

<p>Author: Eran Swears, Anthony Hoogs, Kim Boyer</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing functional scene elemeents in video scenes based on the behaviors of moving objects that interact with them is an emerging problem ooff interest. Existing approaches have a limited ability to chharacterize elements such as cross-walks, intersections, andd buildings that have low activity, are multi-modal, or havee indirect evidence. Our approach recognizes the low activvity and multi-model elements (crosswalks/intersections) by introducing a hierarchy of descriptive clusters to fform a pyramid of codebooks that is sparse in the numbber of clusters and dense in content. The incorporation oof local behavioral context such as person-enter-building aand vehicle-parking nearby enables the detection of elemennts that do not have direct motion-based evidence, e.g. buuildings. These two contributions significantly improvee scene element recognition when compared against thhree state-of-the-art approaches. Results are shown on tyypical ground level surveillance video and for the first time on the more complex Wide Area Motion Imagery.</p><p>2 0.8643657 <a title="354-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Pedestrian_Parsing_via_Deep_Decompositional_Network.html">311 iccv-2013-Pedestrian Parsing via Deep Decompositional Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new Deep Decompositional Network (DDN) for parsing pedestrian images into semantic regions, such as hair, head, body, arms, and legs, where the pedestrians can be heavily occluded. Unlike existing methods based on template matching or Bayesian inference, our approach directly maps low-level visual features to the label maps of body parts with DDN, which is able to accurately estimate complex pose variations with good robustness to occlusions and background clutters. DDN jointly estimates occluded regions and segments body parts by stacking three types of hidden layers: occlusion estimation layers, completion layers, and decomposition layers. The occlusion estimation layers estimate a binary mask, indicating which part of a pedestrian is invisible. The completion layers synthesize low-level features of the invisible part from the original features and the occlusion mask. The decomposition layers directly transform the synthesized visual features to label maps. We devise a new strategy to pre-train these hidden layers, and then fine-tune the entire network using the stochastic gradient descent. Experimental results show that our approach achieves better segmentation accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods on pedestrian images with or without occlusions. Another important contribution of this paper is that it provides a large scale benchmark human parsing dataset1 that includes 3, 673 annotated samples collected from 171 surveillance videos. It is 20 times larger than existing public datasets.</p><p>3 0.85577786 <a title="354-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Bounded_Labeling_Function_for_Global_Segmentation_of_Multi-part_Objects_with_Geometric_Constraints.html">63 iccv-2013-Bounded Labeling Function for Global Segmentation of Multi-part Objects with Geometric Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel Wesierski, Patrick Horain</p><p>Abstract: Elongated objects have various shapes and can shift, rotate, change scale, and be rigid or deform by flexing, articulating, and vibrating, with examples as varied as a glass bottle, a robotic arm, a surgical suture, a finger pair, a tram, and a guitar string. This generally makes tracking of poses of elongated objects very challenging. We describe a unified, configurable framework for tracking the pose of elongated objects, which move in the image plane and extend over the image region. Our method strives for simplicity, versatility, and efficiency. The object is decomposed into a chained assembly of segments of multiple parts that are arranged under a hierarchy of tailored spatio-temporal constraints. In this hierarchy, segments can rescale independently while their elasticity is controlled with global orientations and local distances. While the trend in tracking is to design complex, structure-free algorithms that update object appearance on- line, we show that our tracker, with the novel but remarkably simple, structured organization of parts with constant appearance, reaches or improves state-of-the-art performance. Most importantly, our model can be easily configured to track exact pose of arbitrary, elongated objects in the image plane. The tracker can run up to 100 fps on a desktop PC, yet the computation time scales linearly with the number of object parts. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to generic tracking of elongated objects.</p><p>6 0.75238049 <a title="354-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Illuminant_Chromaticity_from_Image_Sequences.html">207 iccv-2013-Illuminant Chromaticity from Image Sequences</a></p>

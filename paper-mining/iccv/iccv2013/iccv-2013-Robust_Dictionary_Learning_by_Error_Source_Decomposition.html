<p>Author: Yan Xia, Kaiming He, Fang Wen, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: Inverted indexing is a popular non-exhaustive solution to large scale search. An inverted file is built by a quantizer such as k-means or a tree structure. It has been found that multiple inverted files, obtained by multiple independent random quantizers, are able to achieve practically good recall and speed. Instead of computing the multiple quantizers independently, we present a method that creates them jointly. Our method jointly optimizes all codewords in all quantizers. Then it assigns these codewords to the quantizers. In experiments this method shows significant improvement over various existing methods that use multiple independent quantizers. On the one-billion set of SIFT vectors, our method is faster and more accurate than a recent state-of-the-art inverted indexing method.</p><p>3 0.16234981 <a title="354-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Noise_Level_Estimation_from_Personal_Photo_Collections.html">223 iccv-2013-Joint Noise Level Estimation from Personal Photo Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Yichang Shih, Vivek Kwatra, Troy Chinen, Hui Fang, Sergey Ioffe</p><p>Abstract: Personal photo albums are heavily biased towards faces of people, but most state-of-the-art algorithms for image denoising and noise estimation do not exploit facial information. We propose a novel technique for jointly estimating noise levels of all face images in a photo collection. Photos in a personal album are likely to contain several faces of the same people. While some of these photos would be clean and high quality, others may be corrupted by noise. Our key idea is to estimate noise levels by comparing multiple images of the same content that differ predominantly in their noise content. Specifically, we compare geometrically and photometrically aligned face images of the same person. Our estimation algorithm is based on a probabilistic formulation that seeks to maximize the joint probability of estimated noise levels across all images. We propose an approximate solution that decomposes this joint maximization into a two-stage optimization. The first stage determines the relative noise between pairs of images by pooling estimates from corresponding patch pairs in a probabilistic fashion. The second stage then jointly optimizes for all absolute noise parameters by conditioning them upon relative noise levels, which allows for a pairwise factorization of the probability distribution. We evaluate our noise estimation method using quantitative experiments to measure accuracy on synthetic data. Additionally, we employ the estimated noise levels for automatic denoising using “BM3D”, and evaluate the quality of denoising on real-world photos through a user study.</p><p>4 0.15004617 <a title="354-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Subspace_Clustering_via_Half-Quadratic_Minimization.html">360 iccv-2013-Robust Subspace Clustering via Half-Quadratic Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yingya Zhang, Zhenan Sun, Ran He, Tieniu Tan</p><p>Abstract: Subspace clustering has important and wide applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. It is a challenging task to learn low-dimensional subspace structures due to the possible errors (e.g., noise and corruptions) existing in high-dimensional data. Recent subspace clustering methods usually assume a sparse representation of corrupted errors and correct the errors iteratively. However large corruptions in real-world applications can not be well addressed by these methods. A novel optimization model for robust subspace clustering is proposed in this paper. The objective function of our model mainly includes two parts. The first part aims to achieve a sparse representation of each high-dimensional data point with other data points. The second part aims to maximize the correntropy between a given data point and its low-dimensional representation with other points. Correntropy is a robust measure so that the influence of large corruptions on subspace clustering can be greatly suppressed. An extension of our method with explicit introduction of representation error terms into the model is also proposed. Half-quadratic minimization is provided as an efficient solution to the proposed robust subspace clustering formulations. Experimental results on Hopkins 155 dataset and Extended Yale Database B demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.</p><p>5 0.13754041 <a title="354-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_New_Image_Quality_Metric_for_Image_Auto-denoising.html">23 iccv-2013-A New Image Quality Metric for Image Auto-denoising</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiangfei Kong, Kuan Li, Qingxiong Yang, Liu Wenyin, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new non-reference image quality metric that can be adopted by the state-of-the-art image/video denoising algorithms for auto-denoising. The proposed metric is extremely simple and can be implemented in four lines of Matlab code1. The basic assumption employed by the proposed metric is that the noise should be independent of the original image. A direct measurement of this dependence is, however, impractical due to the relatively low accuracy of existing denoising method. The proposed metric thus aims at maximizing the structure similarity between the input noisy image and the estimated image noise around homogeneous regions and the structure similarity between the input noisy image and the denoised image around highly-structured regions, and is computed as the linear correlation coefficient of the two corresponding structure similarity maps. Numerous experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric not only outperforms the current state-of-the-art non-reference quality metric quantitatively and qualitatively, but also better maintains temporal coherence when used for video denoising. ˜</p><p>6 0.1253134 <a title="354-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Semi-supervised_Robust_Dictionary_Learning_via_Efficient_l-Norms_Minimization.html">384 iccv-2013-Semi-supervised Robust Dictionary Learning via Efficient l-Norms Minimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Deyu Meng, Fernando De_La_Torre</p><p>Abstract: Many problems in computer vision can be posed as recovering a low-dimensional subspace from highdimensional visual data. Factorization approaches to lowrank subspace estimation minimize a loss function between an observed measurement matrix and a bilinear factorization. Most popular loss functions include the L2 and L1 losses. L2 is optimal for Gaussian noise, while L1 is for Laplacian distributed noise. However, real data is often corrupted by an unknown noise distribution, which is unlikely to be purely Gaussian or Laplacian. To address this problem, this paper proposes a low-rank matrix factorization problem with a Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) noise model. The MoG model is a universal approximator for any continuous distribution, and hence is able to model a wider range of noise distributions. The parameters of the MoG model can be estimated with a maximum likelihood method, while the subspace is computed with standard approaches. We illustrate the benefits of our approach in extensive syn- thetic and real-world experiments including structure from motion, face modeling and background subtraction.</p><p>4 0.72470456 <a title="354-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Bayesian_Robust_Matrix_Factorization_for_Image_and_Video_Processing.html">60 iccv-2013-Bayesian Robust Matrix Factorization for Image and Video Processing</a></p>
<p>Author: Naiyan Wang, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: Matrix factorization is a fundamental problem that is often encountered in many computer vision and machine learning tasks. In recent years, enhancing the robustness of matrix factorization methods has attracted much attention in the research community. To benefit from the strengths of full Bayesian treatment over point estimation, we propose here a full Bayesian approach to robust matrix factorization. For the generative process, the model parameters have conjugate priors and the likelihood (or noise model) takes the form of a Laplace mixture. For Bayesian inference, we devise an efficient sampling algorithm by exploiting a hierarchical view of the Laplace distribution. Besides the basic model, we also propose an extension which assumes that the outliers exhibit spatial or temporal proximity as encountered in many computer vision applications. The proposed methods give competitive experimental results when compared with several state-of-the-art methods on some benchmark image and video processing tasks.</p><p>5 0.71950793 <a title="354-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Sparsity-Based_Orthogonal_Dictionary_Learning_for_Image_Restoration.html">161 iccv-2013-Fast Sparsity-Based Orthogonal Dictionary Learning for Image Restoration</a></p>
<p>Author: Chenglong Bao, Jian-Feng Cai, Hui Ji</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, how to learn a dictionary from input images for sparse modelling has been one very active topic in image processing and recognition. Most existing dictionary learning methods consider an over-complete dictionary, e.g. the K-SVD method. Often they require solving some minimization problem that is very challenging in terms of computational feasibility and efficiency. However, if the correlations among dictionary atoms are not well constrained, the redundancy of the dictionary does not necessarily improve the performance of sparse coding. This paper proposed a fast orthogonal dictionary learning method for sparse image representation. With comparable performance on several image restoration tasks, the proposed method is much more computationally efficient than the over-complete dictionary based learning methods.</p><p>6 0.67670119 <a title="354-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_Generalized_Low-Rank_Appearance_Model_for_Spatio-temporally_Correlated_Rain_Streaks.html">15 iccv-2013-A Generalized Low-Rank Appearance Model for Spatio-temporally Correlated Rain Streaks</a></p>

<p>Author: Chi Xu, Li Cheng</p><p>Abstract: We tackle the practical problem of hand pose estimation from a single noisy depth image. A dedicated three-step pipeline is proposed: Initial estimation step provides an initial estimation of the hand in-plane orientation and 3D location; Candidate generation step produces a set of 3D pose candidate from the Hough voting space with the help of the rotational invariant depth features; Verification step delivers the final 3D hand pose as the solution to an optimization problem. We analyze the depth noises, and suggest tips to minimize their negative impacts on the overall performance. Our approach is able to work with Kinecttype noisy depth images, and reliably produces pose estimations of general motions efficiently (12 frames per second). Extensive experiments are conducted to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the performance with respect to the state-of-the-art methods that have access to additional RGB images. Our approach is shown to deliver on par or even better results.</p><p>2 0.96603358 <a title="354-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Unifying_Nuclear_Norm_and_Bilinear_Factorization_Approaches_for_Low-Rank_Matrix_Decomposition.html">434 iccv-2013-Unifying Nuclear Norm and Bilinear Factorization Approaches for Low-Rank Matrix Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ricardo Cabral, Fernando De_La_Torre, João P. Costeira, Alexandre Bernardino</p><p>Abstract: Low rank models have been widely usedfor the representation of shape, appearance or motion in computer vision problems. Traditional approaches to fit low rank models make use of an explicit bilinear factorization. These approaches benefit from fast numerical methods for optimization and easy kernelization. However, they suffer from serious local minima problems depending on the loss function and the amount/type of missing data. Recently, these lowrank models have alternatively been formulated as convex problems using the nuclear norm regularizer; unlike factorization methods, their numerical solvers are slow and it is unclear how to kernelize them or to impose a rank a priori. This paper proposes a unified approach to bilinear factorization and nuclear norm regularization, that inherits the benefits of both. We analyze the conditions under which these approaches are equivalent. Moreover, based on this analysis, we propose a new optimization algorithm and a “rank continuation ” strategy that outperform state-of-theart approaches for Robust PCA, Structure from Motion and Photometric Stereo with outliers and missing data.</p><p>3 0.94999748 <a title="354-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Object_Segmentation_in_Unconstrained_Video.html">160 iccv-2013-Fast Object Segmentation in Unconstrained Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Anestis Papazoglou, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: We present a technique for separating foreground objects from the background in a video. Our method isfast, , fully automatic, and makes minimal assumptions about the video. This enables handling essentially unconstrained settings, including rapidly moving background, arbitrary object motion and appearance, and non-rigid deformations and articulations. In experiments on two datasets containing over 1400 video shots, our method outperforms a state-of-theart background subtraction technique [4] as well as methods based on clustering point tracks [6, 18, 19]. Moreover, it performs comparably to recent video object segmentation methods based on objectproposals [14, 16, 27], while being orders of magnitude faster.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.93615216 <a title="354-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Dictionary_Learning_by_Error_Source_Decomposition.html">354 iccv-2013-Robust Dictionary Learning by Error Source Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhuoyuan Chen, Ying Wu</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity models have recently shown great promise in many vision tasks. Using a learned dictionary in sparsity models can in general outperform predefined bases in clean data. In practice, both training and testing data may be corrupted and contain noises and outliers. Although recent studies attempted to cope with corrupted data and achieved encouraging results in testing phase, how to handle corruption in training phase still remains a very difficult problem. In contrast to most existing methods that learn the dictionaryfrom clean data, this paper is targeted at handling corruptions and outliers in training data for dictionary learning. We propose a general method to decompose the reconstructive residual into two components: a non-sparse component for small universal noises and a sparse component for large outliers, respectively. In addition, , further analysis reveals the connection between our approach and the “partial” dictionary learning approach, updating only part of the prototypes (or informative codewords) with remaining (or noisy codewords) fixed. Experiments on synthetic data as well as real applications have shown satisfactory per- formance of this new robust dictionary learning approach.</p><p>5 0.93097955 <a title="354-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Interactive_Markerless_Articulated_Hand_Motion_Tracking_Using_RGB_and_Depth_Data.html">218 iccv-2013-Interactive Markerless Articulated Hand Motion Tracking Using RGB and Depth Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Srinath Sridhar, Antti Oulasvirta, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: Tracking the articulated 3D motion of the hand has important applications, for example, in human–computer interaction and teleoperation. We present a novel method that can capture a broad range of articulated hand motions at interactive rates. Our hybrid approach combines, in a voting scheme, a discriminative, part-based pose retrieval method with a generative pose estimation method based on local optimization. Color information from a multiview RGB camera setup along with a person-specific hand model are used by the generative method to find the pose that best explains the observed images. In parallel, our discriminative pose estimation method uses fingertips detected on depth data to estimate a complete or partial pose of the hand by adopting a part-based pose retrieval strategy. This part-based strategy helps reduce the search space drastically in comparison to a global pose retrieval strategy. Quantitative results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging sequences and a near-realtime performance of 10 fps on a desktop computer.</p><p>6 0.92534924 <a title="354-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_Novel_Earth_Mover%27s_Distance_Methodology_for_Image_Matching_with_Gaussian_Mixture_Models.html">25 iccv-2013-A Novel Earth Mover's Distance Methodology for Image Matching with Gaussian Mixture Models</a></p>

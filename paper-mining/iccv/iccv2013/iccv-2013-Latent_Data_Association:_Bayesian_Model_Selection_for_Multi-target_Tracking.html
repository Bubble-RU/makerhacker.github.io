</p><p>6 Introduction Multi-target tracking is an important, but stubborn problem in Computer Vision as well as many related fields (notably robotics). [sent-13, score-0.238]
</p><p>7 The first is the combinatorial space of possible associations between the observations and objects being tracked, and the second is model selection over the number of existing tracks. [sent-17, score-0.189]
</p><p>8 In this paper we propose Latent Data Association as an alternative parametrization of the data association problem where the number of underlying target tracks is implicit in the data association. [sent-18, score-0.75]
</p><p>9 We treat the new parametrization as a special case of a Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS) [19], and perform approximate inference using a Ian Reid Department of Computer Science, University of Adelaide i . [sent-19, score-0.191]
</p><p>10 Nodes are numbered within each time slice and colored based on their global track membership. [sent-25, score-0.206]
</p><p>11 Each node represents a single latent track state together with any observations (if they exist). [sent-26, score-0.634]
</p><p>12 By treating multi-target tracking as an approximate hybrid inference problem, more complex reasoning about object classification can be incorporated into the same algorithm used for data association and tracking. [sent-28, score-0.67]
</p><p>13 This is accomplished by adding discrete object category 2904  variables into the tracking model. [sent-30, score-0.385]
</p><p>14 Using this model allows the classification and tracking problem to be naturally combined into a single system where statistical relationships between target motion (tracking) and target identity (detection and classification) can be exploited. [sent-32, score-0.455]
</p><p>15 Previous Work Classical approaches to multi-target tracking were pioneered decades ago assuming point-like targets such as radar returns. [sent-34, score-0.372]
</p><p>16 Most of these were progressive variations and generalizations of single target tracking in a cluttered environment. [sent-35, score-0.329]
</p><p>17 The Probabilistic Data Association Filter (PDAF) [5] only deals with a single target at a time, but introduced  the notion of soft data association based on a weighted mixture of measurements. [sent-36, score-0.461]
</p><p>18 The Multiple Hypothesis Tracker (MHT) [22] keeps a list of all possible data association hypotheses and the resulting filter outputs for each target. [sent-38, score-0.408]
</p><p>19 This technique re-frames multi-target tracking as the fusion of an object detector [10, 11, 21] with data association. [sent-40, score-0.297]
</p><p>20 In contrast to classical methods focusing on radar data with point measurements, TBD literature has focused on tracking objects in video sequences. [sent-41, score-0.335]
</p><p>21 The tracking question is formulated as linking compatible detections on the grid into consistent trajectories. [sent-44, score-0.349]
</p><p>22 Berclaz et al [7] form a sparse graph over every hypothetical discrete object locations. [sent-45, score-0.205]
</p><p>23 it is not easy to combine with a moving sensor platform) and forces a compromise between accuracy and the size of the tracking area. [sent-50, score-0.238]
</p><p>24 All continuous variables are treated as such and smoothing of the output trajectories  is done implicitly via the motion model without any postprocessing. [sent-52, score-0.189]
</p><p>25 In this case, the set of discrete detections is partitioned into tracks without explicitly enumerating what happens to the target in between successive detections. [sent-54, score-0.439]
</p><p>26 Jiang et al [14] formulates data association as a Linear Program (LP) over the sparse graph of detections. [sent-55, score-0.453]
</p><p>27 Monte Carlo based approaches represent the distribution over the state space as a set of discrete samples. [sent-58, score-0.189]
</p><p>28 In the case of Particle Filters (PF), these samples are manipulated so that their distribution tracks the posterior of the filter. [sent-60, score-0.245]
</p><p>29 The JPDAF can be implemented as a PF [24, 25] in order to track people from a mobile platform using 2D laser range data. [sent-61, score-0.206]
</p><p>30 Khan et al [15] use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based particle filter to incorporate motion priors over target interactions. [sent-62, score-0.345]
</p><p>31 Breitenstein et al [9] introduce the Detector Confidence Particle Filter (DCPF) to directly incorporate detector scores as a measure of confidence. [sent-63, score-0.183]
</p><p>32 MCMC can also be used as an independent tracking algorithm by sampling over the joint posterior of the whole problem. [sent-65, score-0.323]
</p><p>33 Recently, Benfold et al [6] proposed a real-time global MCMC strategy which simply ignores the continuous state variables of the targets and samples directly over groupings of observations. [sent-67, score-0.387]
</p><p>34 This has the disadvantage of losing the latent/hidden state space of the targets and so requires postprocessing to recover smooth trajectories. [sent-68, score-0.194]
</p><p>35 Andriyenko et al [3, 4] formulate tracking as a direct optimization problems over splines, and in the latter case discrete track labels. [sent-69, score-0.611]
</p><p>36 We assume a fixed number of tracks and attempt to simultaneously find the target trajectories and the data association of observations to targets. [sent-78, score-0.775]

</p><p>38 follows the trajectory Xm = The data association problem is classically formulated as finding a correspondence between the targets and observations at each point in time. [sent-96, score-0.569]
</p><p>39 In this notation, di(t) = j ∈ {1, , M} indicates that the observation zi(t) is associated with the jth target, with the constraint that dDis(tc)r =  · · ·  no two observations can be assigned to the same target. [sent-101, score-0.185]
</p><p>40 While the classical approach attempts to assign observations to previously existing tracks, Latent Data Association starts by assuming that each detection is its own track (of length 1) with a permanently associated hidden state variable. [sent-119, score-0.473]
</p><p>41 The problem of tracking then becomes a question of linking these singleton tracks into longer trajectories. [sent-120, score-0.443]
</p><p>42 We do this by assigning each track at time t as the continuation of some track at t 1. [sent-121, score-0.412]
</p><p>43 We refer to this form of data association as latteimnte eb tec −au 1s. [sent-124, score-0.37]

</p><p>45 Figure 1 illustrates this parametrization with the tracks being spliced between t = 3 and t = 4. [sent-126, score-0.289]
</p><p>46 To define this model formally, we define a node as the set of hidden state variables associated with some track at a specific time instance, as well as any observations of this state. [sent-127, score-0.597]
</p><p>47 For n = (t, i), we define xti as the unobserved state variables of the node and zti as the observations (if present). [sent-130, score-0.898]

</p><p>50 This parametrization of the problem subsumes standard data association as well as model selection over the number of tracks; any number of tracks and any data association can be represented with a suitable value for L = {L(t)}. [sent-143, score-1.029]
</p><p>51 By fixing the set of latent data association indicators, we partition the nodes into independent tracks. [sent-144, score-0.534]
</p><p>52 Each observation zti is generated from the associated target state xti according to an observation model, P(zti |xti). [sent-146, score-0.853]
</p><p>53 (5)  If we assume linear motion and observation models, the model forms an SLDS [19] where the discrete L(t) variables control the relationships between continuous variables in the Markov Chain. [sent-149, score-0.367]

</p><p>57 For a node (t, i), we define prti as the index of the previous node (at t−1) in the same track and nxti as the index ofthe next node t(a−t 1t )+in 1th). [sent-160, score-0.545]
</p><p>58 The forward and backward messages respectively can then be defined recursively as  →μti(xti) =? [sent-162, score-0.189]

</p><p>65 Pedestrian Tracking by Detection with Latent Data Association Up to this point we have described the Latent Data Association parametrization and inference algorithm in general terms. [sent-199, score-0.191]
</p><p>66 To this end we describe the observation and state space models for both 2D and 3D tracking, as well as extensions to handle false positive detections and track length priors. [sent-201, score-0.452]
</p><p>67 Since every detection now corresponds to a track, outliers must correspond to outlier tracks, leading to an extra discrete state variable, cti ∈ {pedestrian, outlier}, representing the target class. [sent-204, score-0.461]
</p><p>68 The pedestrian detectors we use are discriminative, so no generative model exists to explain the observations based on the target class. [sent-207, score-0.307]
</p><p>69 In practice, a lot of information is contained in the missing detections a track with very few detections is more likely to be an outlier than one with many consistent detections. [sent-229, score-0.436]
</p><p>70 To incorporate this negative information, we include detector failure into the observation model. [sent-230, score-0.175]
</p><p>71 The indicator variable mti = 1is used to denote a missing observation at node n = (t, i). [sent-231, score-0.337]
</p><p>72 In this case n is a virtual node and the zti and sti observation variables are ignored. [sent-232, score-0.563]
</p><p>73 Because of the detector failure model, we cannot assume a track continues on indefinitely after its last observation doing so would imply a very large number of missing observations and make all tracks likely to be outliers. [sent-235, score-0.645]
</p><p>74 Instead, we give each target track a fixed probability of terminating at every time instance after its last observation. [sent-236, score-0.336]
</p><p>75 We introduce the indicator variable eti to mark that the track has ended. [sent-237, score-0.28]
</p><p>76 If eti = 1, we require that mti = 1; once a track ends, it cannot have any additional observations. [sent-239, score-0.394]
</p><p>77 9 do not depend on the Markov chain being continuous; analogous equations hold for a discrete chain if the marginalization integrals are replaced with sums. [sent-247, score-0.176]
</p><p>78 We run discrete message passing over eti and cti and compute the track log-likelihood of the data by adding the log-likelihoods obtained from Eq. [sent-248, score-0.647]
</p><p>79 11 with the cost of each assignment based on the combined track loglikelihood. [sent-251, score-0.253]
</p><p>80 Evaluation Experimental validation was performed using four publicly available video sequences comprising over 1200 frames from two standard pedestrian tracking datasets (TUD [1] and PETS’09 [12]). [sent-253, score-0.344]
</p><p>81 2D tracking was used for the TUD datasets and 3D tracking for the PETS sequence. [sent-254, score-0.476]
</p><p>82 We ran 2D tracking on TUD-Stadtmitte despite the available camera calibration because the oblique viewing angle makes accurate estimation of ground plane positions difficult. [sent-255, score-0.238]
</p><p>83 Raw detections, ground truth annotations, and tracking area specifications provided by Andriyenko et al [4] were used for all evaluations. [sent-256, score-0.321]
</p><p>84 Results are presented in terms of the CLEAR MOT [8] metrics for tracking performance and precision-recall curves for classification accuracy. [sent-257, score-0.238]
</p><p>85 In the 2D case, the continuous state space is composed of the bounding box center and the log of the dimensions. [sent-261, score-0.191]
</p><p>86 Both the position, p, and logdimensions, d, have an associated velocity ( p˙ and resulting in an 8D state space: (px , py, dx , dy , p˙ x , p˙ y, d˙x , d˙y). [sent-263, score-0.232]
</p><p>87 We again use a constant-velocity model for the ground plane position, but assume the dimensions follow a random walk with no velocity (unlike in the 2D tracking case, we expect the 3D dimensions to stay relatively constant). [sent-284, score-0.387]
</p><p>88 Because our system keeps track of object sizes as well as location, the size of the bounding boxes output by the detector vs the size of the labeled ground truth plays an important role in the performance of the system. [sent-316, score-0.304]
</p><p>89 In this case we assumed average 3D pedestrian dimensions and projected these into 2D bounding boxes. [sent-329, score-0.196]
</p><p>90 These curves are possible because of the probabilistic nature of our approach where each output has an associated posterior pedestrian vs outlier probability. [sent-338, score-0.311]
</p><p>91 While these figures convey the quantitative measures of performance, we encourage the reader to view the supplementary material to observe the qualitative tracking behavior and performance. [sent-339, score-0.238]

We develop a Bayesian modeling approach for tracking people in 3D from monocular video with unknown cameras. Modeling in 3D provides natural explanations for occlusions and smoothness discontinuities that result from projection, and allows priors on velocity and smoothness to be grounded in physical quantities: meters and seconds vs. pixels and frames. We pose the problem in the context of data association, in which observations are assigned to tracks. A correct application of Bayesian inference to multitarget tracking must address the fact that the model’s dimension changes as tracks are added or removed, and thus, posterior densities of different hypotheses are not comparable. We address this by marginalizing out the trajectory parameters so the resulting posterior over data associations has constant dimension. This is made tractable by using (a) Gaussian process priors for smooth trajectories and (b) approximately Gaussian likelihood functions. Our approach provides a principled method for incorporating multiple sources of evidence; we present results using both optical flow and object detector outputs. Results are comparable to recent work on 3D tracking and, unlike others, our method requires no pre-calibrated cameras.</p><p>3 0.17762239 <a title="230-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminative_Label_Propagation_for_Multi-object_Tracking_with_Sporadic_Appearance_Features.html">120 iccv-2013-Discriminative Label Propagation for Multi-object Tracking with Sporadic Appearance Features</a></p>
<p>Author: K.C. Amit Kumar, Christophe De_Vleeschouwer</p><p>Abstract: Given a set of plausible detections, detected at each time instant independently, we investigate how to associate them across time. This is done by propagating labels on a set of graphs that capture how the spatio-temporal and the appearance cues promote the assignment of identical or distinct labels to a pair of nodes. The graph construction is driven by the locally linear embedding (LLE) of either the spatio-temporal or the appearance features associated to the detections. Interestingly, the neighborhood of a node in each appearance graph is defined to include all nodes for which the appearance feature is available (except the ones that coexist at the same time). This allows to connect the nodes that share the same appearance even if they are temporally distant, which gives our framework the uncommon ability to exploit the appearance features that are available only sporadically along the sequence of detections. Once the graphs have been defined, the multi-object tracking is formulated as the problem of finding a label assignment that is consistent with the constraints captured by each of the graphs. This results into a difference of convex program that can be efficiently solved. Experiments are performed on a basketball and several well-known pedestrian datasets in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</p><p>4 0.17230441 <a title="230-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_People_Detectors_for_Tracking_in_Crowded_Scenes.html">242 iccv-2013-Learning People Detectors for Tracking in Crowded Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Siyu Tang, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Anton Milan, Konrad Schindler, Stefan Roth, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: People tracking in crowded real-world scenes is challenging due to frequent and long-term occlusions. Recent tracking methods obtain the image evidence from object (people) detectors, but typically use off-the-shelf detectors and treat them as black box components. In this paper we argue that for best performance one should explicitly train people detectors on failure cases of the overall tracker instead. To that end, we first propose a novel joint people detector that combines a state-of-the-art single person detector with a detector for pairs of people, which explicitly exploits common patterns of person-person occlusions across multiple viewpoints that are a frequent failure case for tracking in crowded scenes. To explicitly address remaining failure modes of the tracker we explore two methods. First, we analyze typical failures of trackers and train a detector explicitly on these cases. And second, we train the detector with the people tracker in the loop, focusing on the most common tracker failures. We show that our joint multi-person detector significantly improves both de- tection accuracy as well as tracker performance, improving the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks.</p><p>5 0.17030871 <a title="230-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-PixelTrack%3A_A_Fast_Adaptive_Algorithm_for_Tracking_Non-rigid_Objects.html">318 iccv-2013-PixelTrack: A Fast Adaptive Algorithm for Tracking Non-rigid Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Duffner, Christophe Garcia</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for fast tracking of generic objects in videos. The algorithm uses two components: a detector that makes use of the generalised Hough transform with pixel-based descriptors, and a probabilistic segmentation method based on global models for foreground and background. These components are used for tracking in a combined way, and they adapt each other in a co-training manner. Through effective model adaptation and segmentation, the algorithm is able to track objects that undergo rigid and non-rigid deformations and considerable shape and appearance variations. The proposed tracking method has been thoroughly evaluated on challenging standard videos, and outperforms state-of-theart tracking methods designed for the same task. Finally, the proposed models allow for an extremely efficient implementation, and thus tracking is very fast.</p><p>6 0.15736738 <a title="230-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Segmentation_by_Tracking_Many_Figure-Ground_Segments.html">442 iccv-2013-Video Segmentation by Tracking Many Figure-Ground Segments</a></p>

We develop a Bayesian modeling approach for tracking people in 3D from monocular video with unknown cameras. Modeling in 3D provides natural explanations for occlusions and smoothness discontinuities that result from projection, and allows priors on velocity and smoothness to be grounded in physical quantities: meters and seconds vs. pixels and frames. We pose the problem in the context of data association, in which observations are assigned to tracks. A correct application of Bayesian inference to multitarget tracking must address the fact that the model’s dimension changes as tracks are added or removed, and thus, posterior densities of different hypotheses are not comparable. We address this by marginalizing out the trajectory parameters so the resulting posterior over data associations has constant dimension. This is made tractable by using (a) Gaussian process priors for smooth trajectories and (b) approximately Gaussian likelihood functions. Our approach provides a principled method for incorporating multiple sources of evidence; we present results using both optical flow and object detector outputs. Results are comparable to recent work on 3D tracking and, unlike others, our method requires no pre-calibrated cameras.</p><p>3 0.78072149 <a title="230-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Conservation_Tracking.html">87 iccv-2013-Conservation Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Schiegg, Philipp Hanslovsky, Bernhard X. Kausler, Lars Hufnagel, Fred A. Hamprecht</p><p>Abstract: The quality of any tracking-by-assignment hinges on the accuracy of the foregoing target detection / segmentation step. In many kinds of images, errors in this first stage are unavoidable. These errors then propagate to, and corrupt, the tracking result. Our main contribution is the first probabilistic graphical model that can explicitly account for over- and undersegmentation errors even when the number of tracking targets is unknown and when they may divide, as in cell cultures. The tracking model we present implements global consistency constraints for the number of targets comprised by each detection and is solved to global optimality on reasonably large 2D+t and 3D+t datasets. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of a postprocessing that allows to establish target identity even across occlusion / undersegmentation. The usefulness and efficiency of this new tracking method is demonstrated on three different and challenging 2D+t and 3D+t datasets from developmental biology.</p><p>4 0.72755623 <a title="230-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Orderless_Tracking_through_Model-Averaged_Posterior_Estimation.html">303 iccv-2013-Orderless Tracking through Model-Averaged Posterior Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Seunghoon Hong, Suha Kwak, Bohyung Han</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel offline tracking algorithm based on model-averaged posterior estimation through patch matching across frames. Contrary to existing online and offline tracking methods, our algorithm is not based on temporallyordered estimates of target state but attempts to select easyto-track frames first out of the remaining ones without exploiting temporal coherency of target. The posterior of the selected frame is estimated by propagating densities from the already tracked frames in a recursive manner. The density propagation across frames is implemented by an efficient patch matching technique, which is useful for our algorithm since it does not require motion smoothness assumption. Also, we present a hierarchical approach, where a small set of key frames are tracked first and non-key frames are handled by local key frames. Our tracking algorithm is conceptually well-suited for the sequences with abrupt motion, shot changes, and occlusion. We compare our tracking algorithm with existing techniques in real videos with such challenges and illustrate its superior performance qualitatively and quantitatively.</p><p>5 0.6596787 <a title="230-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-The_Way_They_Move%3A_Tracking_Multiple_Targets_with_Similar_Appearance.html">418 iccv-2013-The Way They Move: Tracking Multiple Targets with Similar Appearance</a></p>
<p>Author: Caglayan Dicle, Octavia I. Camps, Mario Sznaier</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient algorithm for multi-object tracking by detection that addresses four main challenges: appearance similarity among targets, missing data due to targets being out of the field of view or occluded behind other objects, crossing trajectories, and camera motion. The proposed method uses motion dynamics as a cue to distinguish targets with similar appearance, minimize target mis-identification and recover missing data. Computational efficiency is achieved by using a Generalized Linear Assignment (GLA) coupled with efficient procedures to recover missing data and estimate the complexity of the underlying dynamics. The proposed approach works with tracklets of arbitrary length and does not assume a dynamical model a priori, yet it captures the overall motion dynamics of the targets. Experiments using challenging videos show that this framework can handle complex target motions, non-stationary cameras and long occlusions, on scenarios where appearance cues are not available or poor.</p><p>6 0.65669107 <a title="230-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminative_Label_Propagation_for_Multi-object_Tracking_with_Sporadic_Appearance_Features.html">120 iccv-2013-Discriminative Label Propagation for Multi-object Tracking with Sporadic Appearance Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Berg, Peter N. Belhumeur</p><p>Abstract: How do you tell a blackbirdfrom a crow? There has been great progress toward automatic methods for visual recognition, including fine-grained visual categorization in which the classes to be distinguished are very similar. In a task such as bird species recognition, automatic recognition systems can now exceed the performance of non-experts – most people are challenged to name a couple dozen bird species, let alone identify them. This leads us to the question, “Can a recognition system show humans what to look for when identifying classes (in this case birds)? ” In the context of fine-grained visual categorization, we show that we can automatically determine which classes are most visually similar, discover what visual features distinguish very similar classes, and illustrate the key features in a way meaningful to humans. Running these methods on a dataset of bird images, we can generate a visual field guide to birds which includes a tree of similarity that displays the similarity relations between all species, pages for each species showing the most similar other species, and pages for each pair of similar species illustrating their differences.</p><p>2 0.83319867 <a title="230-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Dominance%3A_What_Pops_Out%3F.html">53 iccv-2013-Attribute Dominance: What Pops Out?</a></p>

When describing an image, people are likely to describe these dominant attributes first. Attribute dominance is a result of a complex interplay between the various properties present or absent in the image. Which attributes in an image are more dominant than others reveals rich information about the content of the image. In this paper we tap into this information by modeling attribute dominance. We show that this helps improve the performance of vision systems on a variety of human-centric applications such as zero-shot learning, image search and generating textual descriptions of images.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.82433617 <a title="230-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Data_Association%3A_Bayesian_Model_Selection_for_Multi-target_Tracking.html">230 iccv-2013-Latent Data Association: Bayesian Model Selection for Multi-target Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Kaoning Hu, Lijun Yin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-scale topological feature representation for automatic analysis of hand posture. Such topological features have the advantage of being posture-dependent while being preserved under certain variations of illumination, rotation, personal dependency, etc. Our method studies the topology of the holes between the hand region and its convex hull. Inspired by the principle of Persistent Homology, which is the theory of computational topology for topological feature analysis over multiple scales, we construct the multi-scale Betti Numbers matrix (MSBNM) for the topological feature representation. In our experiments, we used 12 different hand postures and compared our features with three popular features (HOG, MCT, and Shape Context) on different data sets. In addition to hand postures, we also extend the feature representations to arm postures. The results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method.</p><p>5 0.76329458 <a title="230-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Unified_Probabilistic_Approach_Modeling_Relationships_between_Attributes_and_Objects.html">31 iccv-2013-A Unified Probabilistic Approach Modeling Relationships between Attributes and Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoyang Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a unified probabilistic model to model the relationships between attributes and objects for attribute prediction and object recognition. As a list of semantically meaningful properties of objects, attributes generally relate to each other statistically. In this paper, we propose a unified probabilistic model to automatically discover and capture both the object-dependent and objectindependent attribute relationships. The model utilizes the captured relationships to benefit both attribute prediction and object recognition. Experiments on four benchmark attribute datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed unified model for improving attribute prediction as well as object recognition in both standard and zero-shot learning cases.</p><p>6 0.76065993 <a title="230-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Box_in_the_Box%3A_Joint_3D_Layout_and_Object_Reasoning_from_Single_Images.html">64 iccv-2013-Box in the Box: Joint 3D Layout and Object Reasoning from Single Images</a></p>

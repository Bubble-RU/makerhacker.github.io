<p>Author: Xiangfei Kong, Kuan Li, Qingxiong Yang, Liu Wenyin, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new non-reference image quality metric that can be adopted by the state-of-the-art image/video denoising algorithms for auto-denoising. The proposed metric is extremely simple and can be implemented in four lines of Matlab code1. The basic assumption employed by the proposed metric is that the noise should be independent of the original image. A direct measurement of this dependence is, however, impractical due to the relatively low accuracy of existing denoising method. The proposed metric thus aims at maximizing the structure similarity between the input noisy image and the estimated image noise around homogeneous regions and the structure similarity between the input noisy image and the denoised image around highly-structured regions, and is computed as the linear correlation coefficient of the two corresponding structure similarity maps. Numerous experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric not only outperforms the current state-of-the-art non-reference quality metric quantitatively and qualitatively, but also better maintains temporal coherence when used for video denoising. ˜</p><p>3 0.21208613 <a title="394-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-DCSH_-_Matching_Patches_in_RGBD_Images.html">101 iccv-2013-DCSH - Matching Patches in RGBD Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Yaron Eshet, Simon Korman, Eyal Ofek, Shai Avidan</p><p>Abstract: We extend patch based methods to work on patches in 3D space. We start with Coherency Sensitive Hashing [12] (CSH), which is an algorithm for matching patches between two RGB images, and extend it to work with RGBD images. This is done by warping all 3D patches to a common virtual plane in which CSH is performed. To avoid noise due to warping of patches of various normals and depths, we estimate a group of dominant planes and compute CSH on each plane separately, before merging the matching patches. The result is DCSH - an algorithm that matches world (3D) patches in order to guide the search for image plane matches. An independent contribution is an extension of CSH, which we term Social-CSH. It allows a major speedup of the k nearest neighbor (kNN) version of CSH - its runtime growing linearly, rather than quadratically, in k. Social-CSH is used as a subcomponent of DCSH when many NNs are required, as in the case of image denoising. We show the benefits ofusing depth information to image reconstruction and image denoising, demonstrated on several RGBD images.</p><p>4 0.19868624 <a title="394-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Noise_Level_Estimation_from_Personal_Photo_Collections.html">223 iccv-2013-Joint Noise Level Estimation from Personal Photo Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Yichang Shih, Vivek Kwatra, Troy Chinen, Hui Fang, Sergey Ioffe</p><p>Abstract: Personal photo albums are heavily biased towards faces of people, but most state-of-the-art algorithms for image denoising and noise estimation do not exploit facial information. We propose a novel technique for jointly estimating noise levels of all face images in a photo collection. Photos in a personal album are likely to contain several faces of the same people. While some of these photos would be clean and high quality, others may be corrupted by noise. Our key idea is to estimate noise levels by comparing multiple images of the same content that differ predominantly in their noise content. Specifically, we compare geometrically and photometrically aligned face images of the same person. Our estimation algorithm is based on a probabilistic formulation that seeks to maximize the joint probability of estimated noise levels across all images. We propose an approximate solution that decomposes this joint maximization into a two-stage optimization. The first stage determines the relative noise between pairs of images by pooling estimates from corresponding patch pairs in a probabilistic fashion. The second stage then jointly optimizes for all absolute noise parameters by conditioning them upon relative noise levels, which allows for a pairwise factorization of the probability distribution. We evaluate our noise estimation method using quantitative experiments to measure accuracy on synthetic data. Additionally, we employ the estimated noise levels for automatic denoising using “BM3D”, and evaluate the quality of denoising on real-world photos through a user study.</p><p>5 0.18062459 <a title="394-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Sparsity-Based_Orthogonal_Dictionary_Learning_for_Image_Restoration.html">161 iccv-2013-Fast Sparsity-Based Orthogonal Dictionary Learning for Image Restoration</a></p>

Most existing dictionary learning methods consider an over-complete dictionary, e.g. the K-SVD method.

<p>Author: David Eigen, Dilip Krishnan, Rob Fergus</p><p>Abstract: Photographs taken through a window are often compromised by dirt or rain present on the window surface. Common cases of this include pictures taken from inside a vehicle, or outdoor security cameras mounted inside a protective enclosure. At capture time, defocus can be used to remove the artifacts, but this relies on achieving a shallow depth-of-field and placement of the camera close to the window. Instead, we present a post-capture image processing solution that can remove localized rain and dirt artifacts from a single image. We collect a dataset of clean/corrupted image pairs which are then used to train a specialized form of convolutional neural network. This learns how to map corrupted image patches to clean ones, implicitly capturing the characteristic appearance of dirt and water droplets in natural images. Our models demonstrate effective removal of dirt and rain in outdoor test conditions.</p><p>6 0.66162944 <a title="394-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_Generalized_Low-Rank_Appearance_Model_for_Spatio-temporally_Correlated_Rain_Streaks.html">15 iccv-2013-A Generalized Low-Rank Appearance Model for Spatio-temporally Correlated Rain Streaks</a></p>

<p>Author: Kaoning Hu, Lijun Yin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-scale topological feature representation for automatic analysis of hand posture. Such topological features have the advantage of being posture-dependent while being preserved under certain variations of illumination, rotation, personal dependency, etc. Our method studies the topology of the holes between the hand region and its convex hull. Inspired by the principle of Persistent Homology, which is the theory of computational topology for topological feature analysis over multiple scales, we construct the multi-scale Betti Numbers matrix (MSBNM) for the topological feature representation. In our experiments, we used 12 different hand postures and compared our features with three popular features (HOG, MCT, and Shape Context) on different data sets. In addition to hand postures, we also extend the feature representations to arm postures. The results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method.</p><p>2 0.6681751 <a title="394-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Flattening_Supervoxel_Hierarchies_by_the_Uniform_Entropy_Slice.html">172 iccv-2013-Flattening Supervoxel Hierarchies by the Uniform Entropy Slice</a></p>
<p>Author: Chenliang Xu, Spencer Whitt, Jason J. Corso</p><p>Abstract: Supervoxel hierarchies provide a rich multiscale decomposition of a given video suitable for subsequent processing in video analysis. The hierarchies are typically computed by an unsupervised process that is susceptible to undersegmentation at coarse levels and over-segmentation at fine levels, which make it a challenge to adopt the hierarchies for later use. In this paper, we propose the first method to overcome this limitation and flatten the hierarchy into a single segmentation. Our method, called the uniform entropy slice, seeks a selection of supervoxels that balances the relative level of information in the selected supervoxels based on some post hoc feature criterion such as objectness. For example, with this criterion, in regions nearby objects, our method prefers finer supervoxels to capture the local details, but in regions away from any objects we prefer coarser supervoxels. We formulate the uniform entropy slice as a binary quadratic program and implement four different feature criteria, both unsupervised and supervised, to drive the flattening. Although we apply it only to supervoxel hierarchies in this paper, our method is generally applicable to segmentation tree hierarchies. Our experiments demonstrate both strong qualitative performance and superior quantitative performance to state of the art baselines on benchmark internet videos.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.66468644 <a title="394-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Single-Patch_Low-Rank_Prior_for_Non-pointwise_Impulse_Noise_Removal.html">394 iccv-2013-Single-Patch Low-Rank Prior for Non-pointwise Impulse Noise Removal</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruixuan Wang, Emanuele Trucco</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a ‘low-rank prior’ for small oriented noise-free image patches: considering an oriented patch as a matrix, a low-rank matrix approximation is enough to preserve the texture details in the properly oriented patch. Based on this prior, we propose a single-patch method within a generalized joint low-rank and sparse matrix recovery framework to simultaneously detect and remove non-pointwise random-valued impulse noise (e.g., very small blobs). A weighting matrix is incorporated in the framework to encode an initial estimate of the spatial noise distribution. An accelerated proximal gradient method is adapted to estimate the optimal noise-free image patches. Experiments show the effectiveness of our framework in removing non-pointwise random-valued impulse noise.</p><p>4 0.59124023 <a title="394-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_Framework_for_Shape_Analysis_via_Hilbert_Space_Embedding.html">10 iccv-2013-A Framework for Shape Analysis via Hilbert Space Embedding</a></p>
<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for 2D shape analysis using positive definite kernels defined on Kendall’s shape manifold. Different representations of 2D shapes are known to generate different nonlinear spaces. Due to the nonlinearity of these spaces, most existing shape classification algorithms resort to nearest neighbor methods and to learning distances on shape spaces. Here, we propose to map shapes on Kendall’s shape manifold to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To this end, we introduce a kernel on this manifold that permits such a mapping, and prove its positive definiteness. This kernel lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM, MKL and kernel PCA, to the shape manifold. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods on shape classification, clustering and retrieval.</p><p>5 0.58990788 <a title="394-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Visual_Semantic_Complex_Network_for_Web_Images.html">446 iccv-2013-Visual Semantic Complex Network for Web Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Shi Qiu, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes modeling the complex web image collections with an automatically generated graph structure called visual semantic complex network (VSCN). The nodes on this complex network are clusters of images with both visual and semantic consistency, called semantic concepts. These nodes are connected based on the visual and semantic correlations. Our VSCN with 33, 240 concepts is generated from a collection of 10 million web images. 1 A great deal of valuable information on the structures of the web image collections can be revealed by exploring the VSCN, such as the small-world behavior, concept community, indegree distribution, hubs, and isolated concepts. It not only helps us better understand the web image collections at a macroscopic level, but also has many important practical applications. This paper presents two application examples: content-based image retrieval and image browsing. Experimental results show that the VSCN leads to significant improvement on both the precision of image retrieval (over 200%) and user experience for image browsing.</p><p>6 0.53781164 <a title="394-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Pictorial_Human_Spaces%3A_How_Well_Do_Humans_Perceive_a_3D_Articulated_Pose%3F.html">316 iccv-2013-Pictorial Human Spaces: How Well Do Humans Perceive a 3D Articulated Pose?</a></p>

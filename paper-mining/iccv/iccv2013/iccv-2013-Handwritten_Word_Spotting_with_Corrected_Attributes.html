<p>Author: Xiaoyang Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a unified probabilistic model to model the relationships between attributes and objects for attribute prediction and object recognition. As a list of semantically meaningful properties of objects, attributes generally relate to each other statistically. In this paper, we propose a unified probabilistic model to automatically discover and capture both the object-dependent and objectindependent attribute relationships. The model utilizes the captured relationships to benefit both attribute prediction and object recognition. Experiments on four benchmark attribute datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed unified model for improving attribute prediction as well as object recognition in both standard and zero-shot learning cases.</p><p>3 0.22753635 <a title="192-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Adaptation_for_Personalized_Image_Search.html">52 iccv-2013-Attribute Adaptation for Personalized Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Adriana Kovashka, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: Current methods learn monolithic attribute predictors, with the assumption that a single model is sufficient to reflect human understanding of a visual attribute. However, in reality, humans vary in how they perceive the association between a named property and image content. For example, two people may have slightly different internal models for what makes a shoe look “formal”, or they may disagree on which of two scenes looks “more cluttered”. Rather than discount these differences as noise, we propose to learn user-specific attribute models. We adapt a generic model trained with annotations from multiple users, tailoring it to satisfy user-specific labels. Furthermore, we propose novel techniques to infer user-specific labels based on transitivity and contradictions in the user’s search history. We demonstrate that adapted attributes improve accuracy over both existing monolithic models as well as models that learn from scratch with user-specific data alone. In addition, we show how adapted attributes are useful to personalize image search, whether with binary or relative attributes.</p><p>4 0.22640517 <a title="192-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Retrieval_Using_Textual_Cues.html">210 iccv-2013-Image Retrieval Using Textual Cues</a></p>
<p>Author: Anand Mishra, Karteek Alahari, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach for the text-to-image retrieval problem based on textual content present in images. Given the recent developments in understanding text in images, an appealing approach to address this problem is to localize and recognize the text, and then query the database, as in a text retrieval problem. We show that such an approach, despite being based on state-of-the-artmethods, is insufficient, and propose a method, where we do not rely on an exact localization and recognition pipeline. We take a query-driven search approach, where we find approximate locations of characters in the text query, and then impose spatial constraints to generate a ranked list of images in the database. The retrieval performance is evaluated on public scene text datasets as well as three large datasets, namely IIIT scene text retrieval, Sports-10K and TV series-1M, we introduce.</p><p>5 0.21537231 <a title="192-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Dominance%3A_What_Pops_Out%3F.html">53 iccv-2013-Attribute Dominance: What Pops Out?</a></p>

When describing an image, people are likely to describe these dominant attributes first. Attribute dominance is a result of a complex interplay between the various properties present or absent in the image. Which attributes in an image are more dominant than others reveals rich information about the content of the image. In this paper we tap into this information by modeling attribute dominance.

<p>Author: Shiliang Zhang, Ming Yang, Xiaoyu Wang, Yuanqing Lin, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: Inverted indexes in image retrieval not only allow fast access to database images but also summarize all knowledge about the database, so that their discriminative capacity largely determines the retrieval performance. In this paper, for vocabulary tree based image retrieval, we propose a semantic-aware co-indexing algorithm to jointly San Antonio, TX 78249 . j dl@gmai l com qit ian@cs .ut sa . edu . The query embed two strong cues into the inverted indexes: 1) local invariant features that are robust to delineate low-level image contents, and 2) semantic attributes from large-scale object recognition that may reveal image semantic meanings. For an initial set of inverted indexes of local features, we utilize 1000 semantic attributes to filter out isolated images and insert semantically similar images to the initial set. Encoding these two distinct cues together effectively enhances the discriminative capability of inverted indexes. Such co-indexing operations are totally off-line and introduce small computation overhead to online query cause only local features but no semantic attributes are used for query. Experiments and comparisons with recent retrieval methods on 3 datasets, i.e., UKbench, Holidays, Oxford5K, and 1.3 million images from Flickr as distractors, manifest the competitive performance of our method 1.</p><p>3 0.72670478 <a title="192-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Dominance%3A_What_Pops_Out%3F.html">53 iccv-2013-Attribute Dominance: What Pops Out?</a></p>

<p>Author: Sukrit Shankar, Joan Lasenby, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: Relative (comparative) attributes are promising for thematic ranking of visual entities, which also aids in recognition tasks [19, 23]. However, attribute rank learning often requires a substantial amount of relational supervision, which is highly tedious, and apparently impracticalfor realworld applications. In this paper, we introduce the Semantic Transform, which under minimal supervision, adaptively finds a semantic feature space along with a class ordering that is related in the best possible way. Such a semantic space is found for every attribute category. To relate the classes under weak supervision, the class ordering needs to be refined according to a cost function in an iterative procedure. This problem is ideally NP-hard, and we thus propose a constrained search tree formulation for the same. Driven by the adaptive semantic feature space representation, our model achieves the best results to date for all of the tasks of relative, absolute and zero-shot classification on two popular datasets.</p><p>6 0.70392388 <a title="192-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Spoken_Attributes%3A_Mixing_Binary_and_Relative_Attributes_to_Say_the_Right_Thing.html">399 iccv-2013-Spoken Attributes: Mixing Binary and Relative Attributes to Say the Right Thing</a></p>

<p>Author: Hae-Gon Jeon, Joon-Young Lee, Yudeog Han, Seon Joo Kim, In So Kweon</p><p>Abstract: Finding a good binary sequence is critical in determining theperformance ofthe coded exposure imaging, butprevious methods mostly rely on a random search for finding the binary codes, which could easily fail to find good long sequences due to the exponentially growing search space. In this paper, we present a new computationally efficient algorithm for generating the binary sequence, which is especially well suited for longer sequences. We show that the concept of the low autocorrelation binary sequence that has been well exploited in the information theory community can be applied for generating the fluttering patterns of the shutter, propose a new measure of a good binary sequence, and present a new algorithm by modifying the Legendre sequence for the coded exposure imaging. Experiments using both synthetic and real data show that our new algorithm consistently generates better binary sequencesfor the coded exposure problem, yielding better deblurring and resolution enhancement results compared to the previous methods for generating the binary codes.</p><p>2 0.68031919 <a title="192-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_3D_Reconstruction_from_Uncalibrated_Radially-Symmetric_Cameras.html">280 iccv-2013-Multi-view 3D Reconstruction from Uncalibrated Radially-Symmetric Cameras</a></p>
<p>Author: Jae-Hak Kim, Yuchao Dai, Hongdong Li, Xin Du, Jonghyuk Kim</p><p>Abstract: We present a new multi-view 3D Euclidean reconstruction method for arbitrary uncalibrated radially-symmetric cameras, which needs no calibration or any camera model parameters other than radial symmetry. It is built on the radial 1D camera model [25], a unified mathematical abstraction to different types of radially-symmetric cameras. We formulate the problem of multi-view reconstruction for radial 1D cameras as a matrix rank minimization problem. Efficient implementation based on alternating direction continuation is proposed to handle scalability issue for real-world applications. Our method applies to a wide range of omnidirectional cameras including both dioptric and catadioptric (central and non-central) cameras. Additionally, our method deals with complete and incomplete measurements under a unified framework elegantly.

In this paper we present a new solution to the absolute pose problem for camera with unknown radial distortion and unknown focal length from five 2D-to-3D point correspondences. Our new solver is numerically more stable, more accurate, and significantly faster than the existing state-of-the-art minimal fourpoint absolutepose solvers for this problem. Moreover, our solver results in less solutions and can handle larger radial distortions. The new solver is straightforward and uses only simple concepts from linear algebra. Therefore it is simpler than the state-of-the-art Gr¨ obner basis solvers. We compare our new solver with the existing state-of-theart solvers and show its usefulness on synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.65707701 <a title="192-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Handwritten_Word_Spotting_with_Corrected_Attributes.html">192 iccv-2013-Handwritten Word Spotting with Corrected Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Jon Almazán, Albert Gordo, Alicia Fornés, Ernest Valveny</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to multi-writer word spotting, where the goal is to find a query word in a dataset comprised of document images. We propose an attributes-based approach that leads to a low-dimensional, fixed-length representation of the word images that is fast to compute and, especially, fast to compare. This approach naturally leads to an unified representation of word images and strings, which seamlessly allows one to indistinctly perform queryby-example, where the query is an image, and query-bystring, where the query is a string. We also propose a calibration scheme to correct the attributes scores based on Canonical Correlation Analysis that greatly improves the results on a challenging dataset. We test our approach on two public datasets showing state-of-the-art results.</p><p>5 0.57307661 <a title="192-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Scene_Text_Localization_and_Recognition_with_Oriented_Stroke_Detection.html">376 iccv-2013-Scene Text Localization and Recognition with Oriented Stroke Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Lukáš Neumann, Jiri Matas</p><p>Abstract: An unconstrained end-to-end text localization and recognition method is presented. The method introduces a novel approach for character detection and recognition which combines the advantages of sliding-window and connected component methods. Characters are detected and recognized as image regions which contain strokes of specific orientations in a specific relative position, where the strokes are efficiently detected by convolving the image gradient field with a set of oriented bar filters. Additionally, a novel character representation efficiently calculated from the values obtained in the stroke detection phase is introduced. The representation is robust to shift at the stroke level, which makes it less sensitive to intra-class variations and the noise induced by normalizing character size and positioning. The effectiveness of the representation is demonstrated by the results achieved in the classification of real-world characters using an euclidian nearestneighbor classifier trained on synthetic data in a plain form. The method was evaluated on a standard dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition.</p><p>6 0.57242936 <a title="192-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Class-Specific_Simplex-Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_for_Image_Classification.html">73 iccv-2013-Class-Specific Simplex-Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Image Classification</a></p>

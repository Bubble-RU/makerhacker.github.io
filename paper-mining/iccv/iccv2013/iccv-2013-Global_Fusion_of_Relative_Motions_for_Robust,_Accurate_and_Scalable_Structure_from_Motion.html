</p><p>6 Finally some approaches use a divide-and-conquer approach on the epipolar graph to reduce computations [32, 9, 30, 22]. [sent-33, score-0.269]
</p><p>7 However, incremental approaches are known to suffer from drift due to the accumulation of errors and to the difficulty to handle cycle closures of the camera trajectory. [sent-34, score-0.516]
</p><p>8 The first step computes the global rotation of each view and the second step computes the camera translations, together with the structure or not. [sent-37, score-0.346]
</p><p>9 The interest of separating the two steps is that the relative two-view rotations can be estimated quite precisely even for small baselines, which is not true of relative translations. [sent-38, score-0.527]
</p><p>10 These ap-  proaches take into account the whole epipolar graph, whose nodes represent the views and where edges link views having enough consistent matching points. [sent-39, score-0.367]
</p><p>11 All cycles of the graph yield multi-view constraints, in the sense that the lo33224481  cal relative motions in successive nodes of the cycle should compose into the identity when closing the cycle. [sent-40, score-0.681]
</p><p>12 But such global approaches suffer from the fact that some two-view geometries, even when they have a large support of point correspondences, may fail to reflect the underlying global geometry, mainly because of mismatches, e. [sent-43, score-0.262]
</p><p>13 The problem complexity is kept low using relative motions that can be merged very fast. [sent-48, score-0.247]
</p><p>14 We first solve the structure problem at a local scale (2 and 3 views), then merge the resulting relative motions into a common global coordinate frame. [sent-49, score-0.407]
</p><p>15 We assess the efficiency and precision of our reconstruction pipeline on scenes with ground truth calibration and on challenging datasets with false epipolar geometries. [sent-50, score-0.396]
</p><p>16 Given the relative rotations Rij between views iand j extracted from the essential matrices, computing the global rotation of each view Ri consists in solving the system Rj = RijRi for all i,j. [sent-56, score-0.778]
</p><p>17 This rotation averaging task can be performed by distributing the error along all cycles in a cycle basis, as done by Sharp et al. [sent-59, score-0.562]
</p><p>18 [5] use a cycle belief propagation, but they rely on known orientations, which do not make it suitable in the general case. [sent-65, score-0.288]
</p><p>19 As relative Rij estimates may contain outliers, rotation averaging has to be robust. [sent-67, score-0.268]
</p><p>20 Given the camera epipolar graph, the actual task is to identify both the global rotations and the inconsistent/outlier edges (false essential geometry). [sent-68, score-0.774]
</p><p>21 Random spanning trees are sampled,  and global putative rotations are computed by composing relative rotations while walking a spanning tree. [sent-71, score-0.911]
</p><p>22 The remaining edges, which create cycles, are evaluated based on the rotation angle of RjTRijRi, measuring the discrepancy between the relative motion and the global motion. [sent-72, score-0.365]
</p><p>23 [7] perform cycle removal based on deviation from identity. [sent-77, score-0.288]
</p><p>24 For this, the graph edges are weighted with the numbers of inlier correspondences and a maximum spanning tree (MST) is extracted. [sent-78, score-0.257]
</p><p>25 A cycle is kept if the deviation√ from identity over the cycle, normalized by a factor 1/√l where l is the cycle lenth, is small enough. [sent-80, score-0.576]
</p><p>26 The method is highly dependent on the chosen MST; if this tree is erroneous, estimated rotations are wrong. [sent-81, score-0.304]
</p><p>27 [37] use a Bayesian inference to detect incorrect relative rotation using cycle errors. [sent-83, score-0.554]
</p><p>28 The maximal cycle length is set to 6, also to avoid taking into account uncertainties w. [sent-85, score-0.288]
</p><p>29 Once global camera rotations Ri are estimated, global translations Ti can be computed. [sent-89, score-0.902]
</p><p>30 There are two main approaches, finding translations alone or with the structure. [sent-90, score-0.292]
</p><p>31 Govindu [10] proposes a method for recovering the unknown translations Ti from the heading vectors tij, extracted from the estimated essential matrices. [sent-92, score-0.425]
</p><p>32 [29] propose a solution based on the heading vector extracted from the trifocal tensor that minimizes the angular error between the heading vector and the global camera position. [sent-96, score-0.939]
</p><p>33 The advantage of such a method is that they use a compact formulation (3 number of camera varitahbeleys u) beu at they are highly dependent on tehre o quality ao fv athrieinitial translation estimates. [sent-97, score-0.321]
</p><p>34 The joint estimation of translations and 3D points can be formulated using second-order cone programming expressing the problem with the l∞ norm, as proposed by Hartley and Shaffalitzky [15], and later generalized [16]. [sent-104, score-0.322]
</p><p>35 It relies on two linear programs, the first one identifying outliers, and the second one solving translations and 3D structure on the selected inliers. [sent-110, score-0.326]
</p><p>36 [27] find a global solution by using a growing feasible subset while all the residual errors of the measurements are under the precision of the subset. [sent-115, score-0.237]
</p><p>37 [18] use their global pipeline many times to iteratively discard two-view geometries with largest residuals. [sent-124, score-0.286]
</p><p>38 To keep good running time, they compute the translation and structure just on a few point pairs: each epipolar geometry is represented by 4 points only. [sent-125, score-0.503]
</p><p>39 [4] use a linear parametrization of a tree of trifocal tensors over the epipolar graph to solve the camera position. [sent-127, score-0.778]

</p><p>43 [7], can remove most outlier edges in the graph, allowing a more robust estimation of absolute rotations Ri (Section 2). [sent-140, score-0.408]
</p><p>44 We present a new trifocal tensor estimation method based on l∞ norm, resulting in a linear program, which, used as minimal solver in an adaptive RANSAC algorithm, is efficient and yields stable relative translation directions tij (Section 3). [sent-142, score-1.223]
</p><p>45 We propose a new translation registration method, that estimates the relative translation scales λij and absolute translations Ti, based on the l∞ norm, resulting also in an efficient linear program (Section 4). [sent-144, score-1.045]
</p><p>46 We put together these ingredients into an SfM pipeline (Section 5) that first cleans up an epipolar graph from outliers, then computes the global motions from the relative ones. [sent-146, score-0.651]
</p><p>47 Robust estimation of global rotations  ×  For matching points X and X0 in images Ii and Ij respectively, the two-view epipolar constraint can be written (K−i1X)TEij(K−j1X0)  = 0. [sent-149, score-0.616]
</p><p>48 It is important to note that the rotation accuracy is nearly insensitive to the baseline [7], contrary to the translation direction. [sent-152, score-0.391]
</p><p>49 Besides, although the camera rotations between connected views can be chained, the relative translations cannot since they are available up to a differing unknown scale factor λij . [sent-153, score-0.836]
</p><p>50 We identify inconsistent relative rotations in the graph using the edge disambiguation of Zach et al. [sent-154, score-0.524]

</p><p>56 Robust trifocal tensor with known rotations  Given estimated global rotations Ri, as computed in Section 2, we estimate a “reduced” trifocal tensor using an adaptive RANSAC procedure to be robust to outlier correspondences. [sent-177, score-1.781]
</p><p>57 Our approach consists in computing the tensor using  a small-size linear program as minimal solver with four tracked point across the three views, in conjunction with the AC-RANSAC framework [21] to be robust to noise and outliers. [sent-196, score-0.315]

</p><p>61 Finally, we refine the translations and the k inlier 3D points by bundle adjustment. [sent-221, score-0.409]

</p><p>69 Translation registration Given a set of relative motions pairs (Rij , tij) (rotations and translation directions), we want to find the global location (T1, . [sent-245, score-0.633]
</p><p>70 We are thus looking for n global translations and #tij scale factors λij that reconcile the different translation directions into a global coordinate frame: kTj − RijTi − λijtij k = 0,  ∀i, j. [sent-249, score-0.885]
</p><p>71 As the solution is invariant under translation and scaling, the degrees of freedoms are removed by adding positivity constraints over the λij (scale ambiguity) and setting the first camera at origin (translation ambiguity). [sent-253, score-0.321]
</p><p>72 In our case, we may have different translation directions tij for a given (i, j) ifit belongs to several triplets (see Figure 3, top). [sent-259, score-0.531]

</p><p>80 If trifocal tensor estimation fails, we continue with other triplets containing this edge, if any, in decreasing order of the number of tracks. [sent-288, score-0.642]
</p><p>81 This step not only finds relative translations but also determines coherent 3D structures per triplet. [sent-290, score-0.418]
</p><p>82 We integrate the relative translation directions and compute global translations using the l∞ method of Section 4. [sent-295, score-0.845]
</p><p>83 This global structure and the translations are then refined by bundle adjustment (BA) using the Ceres solver [1]. [sent-299, score-0.684]
</p><p>84 A final BA is used to refine the structure and camera rotation and translation to handle noisy rotation estimates of Step 2. [sent-301, score-0.605]

</p><p>96 We have shown that the global calibration can be performed by globally merging local relative estimates, preserving robustness and accuracy while ensuring scalability. [sent-355, score-0.321]

<p>Author: Nianjuan Jiang, Zhaopeng Cui, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We present a linear method for global camera pose registration from pairwise relative poses encoded in essential matrices. Our method minimizes an approximate geometric error to enforce the triangular relationship in camera triplets. This formulation does not suffer from the typical ‘unbalanced scale ’ problem in linear methods relying on pairwise translation direction constraints, i.e. an algebraic error; nor the system degeneracy from collinear motion. In the case of three cameras, our method provides a good linear approximation of the trifocal tensor. It can be directly scaled up to register multiple cameras. The results obtained are accurate for point triangulation and can serve as a good initialization for final bundle adjustment. We evaluate the algorithm performance with different types of data and demonstrate its effectiveness. Our system produces good accuracy, robustness, and outperforms some well-known systems on efficiency.</p><p>3 0.23100112 <a title="184-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Kneip, Simon Lynen</p><p>Abstract: This work makes use of a novel, recently proposed epipolar constraint for computing the relative pose between two calibrated images. By enforcing the coplanarity of epipolar plane normal vectors, it constrains the three degrees of freedom of the relative rotation between two camera views directly—independently of the translation. The present paper shows how the approach can be extended to n points, and translated into an efficient eigenvalue minimization over the three rotational degrees of freedom. Each iteration in the non-linear optimization has constant execution time, independently of the number of features. Two global optimization approaches are proposed. The first one consists of an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt scheme with randomized initial value, which already leads to stable and accurate results. The second scheme consists of a globally optimal branch-and-bound algorithm based on a bound on the eigenvalue variation derived from symmetric eigenvalue-perturbation theory. Analysis of the cost function reveals insights into the nature of a specific relative pose problem, and outlines the complexity under different conditions.

<p>Author: Avishek Chatterjee, Venu Madhav Govindu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of robust and efficient averaging of relative 3D rotations. Apart from having an interesting geometric structure, robust rotation averaging addresses the need for a good initialization for largescale optimization used in structure-from-motion pipelines. Such pipelines often use unstructured image datasets harvested from the internet thereby requiring an initialization method that is robust to outliers. Our approach works on the Lie group structure of 3D rotations and solves the problem of large-scale robust rotation averaging in two ways. Firstly, we use modern ?1 optimizers to carry out robust averaging of relative rotations that is efficient, scalable and robust to outliers. In addition, we also develop a twostep method that uses the ?1 solution as an initialisation for an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach. These methods achieve excellent results on large-scale, real world datasets and significantly outperform existing methods, i.e. the state-of-the-art discrete-continuous optimization method of [3] as well as the Weiszfeld method of [8]. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two large- scale real world datasets and also provide the results of the two aforementioned methods for comparison.</p><p>5 0.15046419 <a title="184-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminant_Tracking_Using_Tensor_Representation_with_Semi-supervised_Improvement.html">119 iccv-2013-Discriminant Tracking Using Tensor Representation with Semi-supervised Improvement</a></p>
<p>Author: Jin Gao, Junliang Xing, Weiming Hu, Steve Maybank</p><p>Abstract: Visual tracking has witnessed growing methods in object representation, which is crucial to robust tracking. The dominant mechanism in object representation is using image features encoded in a vector as observations to perform tracking, without considering that an image is intrinsically a matrix, or a 2nd-order tensor. Thus approaches following this mechanism inevitably lose a lot of useful information, and therefore cannot fully exploit the spatial correlations within the 2D image ensembles. In this paper, we address an image as a 2nd-order tensor in its original form, and find a discriminative linear embedding space approximation to the original nonlinear submanifold embedded in the tensor space based on the graph embedding framework. We specially design two graphs for characterizing the intrinsic local geometrical structure of the tensor space, so as to retain more discriminant information when reducing the dimension along certain tensor dimensions. However, spatial correlations within a tensor are not limited to the elements along these dimensions. This means that some part of the discriminant information may not be encoded in the embedding space. We introduce a novel technique called semi-supervised improvement to iteratively adjust the embedding space to compensate for the loss of discriminant information, hence improving the performance of our tracker. Experimental results on challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker.</p><p>6 0.14687037 <a title="184-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-SUN3D%3A_A_Database_of_Big_Spaces_Reconstructed_Using_SfM_and_Object_Labels.html">367 iccv-2013-SUN3D: A Database of Big Spaces Reconstructed Using SfM and Object Labels</a></p>

<p>Author: Pierre Moulon, Pascal Monasse, Renaud Marlet</p><p>Abstract: Multi-view structure from motion (SfM) estimates the position and orientation of pictures in a common 3D coordinate frame. When views are treated incrementally, this external calibration can be subject to drift, contrary to global methods that distribute residual errors evenly. We propose a new global calibration approach based on the fusion of relative motions between image pairs. We improve an existing method for robustly computing global rotations. We present an efficient a contrario trifocal tensor estimation method, from which stable and precise translation directions can be extracted. We also define an efficient translation registration method that recovers accurate camera positions. These components are combined into an original SfM pipeline. Our experiments show that, on most datasets, it outperforms in accuracy other existing incremental and global pipelines. It also achieves strikingly good running times: it is about 20 times faster than the other global method we could compare to, and as fast as the best incremental method. More importantly, it features better scalability properties.</p><p>2 0.88320625 <a title="184-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_and_Robust_Large-Scale_Rotation_Averaging.html">138 iccv-2013-Efficient and Robust Large-Scale Rotation Averaging</a></p>

<p>Author: Nianjuan Jiang, Zhaopeng Cui, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We present a linear method for global camera pose registration from pairwise relative poses encoded in essential matrices. Our method minimizes an approximate geometric error to enforce the triangular relationship in camera triplets. This formulation does not suffer from the typical ‘unbalanced scale ’ problem in linear methods relying on pairwise translation direction constraints, i.e. an algebraic error; nor the system degeneracy from collinear motion. In the case of three cameras, our method provides a good linear approximation of the trifocal tensor. It can be directly scaled up to register multiple cameras. The results obtained are accurate for point triangulation and can serve as a good initialization for final bundle adjustment. We evaluate the algorithm performance with different types of data and demonstrate its effectiveness. Our system produces good accuracy, robustness, and outperforms some well-known systems on efficiency.</p><p>4 0.72985137 <a title="184-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Kneip, Simon Lynen</p><p>Abstract: This work makes use of a novel, recently proposed epipolar constraint for computing the relative pose between two calibrated images. By enforcing the coplanarity of epipolar plane normal vectors, it constrains the three degrees of freedom of the relative rotation between two camera views directly—independently of the translation. The present paper shows how the approach can be extended to n points, and translated into an efficient eigenvalue minimization over the three rotational degrees of freedom. Each iteration in the non-linear optimization has constant execution time, independently of the number of features. Two global optimization approaches are proposed. The first one consists of an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt scheme with randomized initial value, which already leads to stable and accurate results. The second scheme consists of a globally optimal branch-and-bound algorithm based on a bound on the eigenvalue variation derived from symmetric eigenvalue-perturbation theory. Analysis of the cost function reveals insights into the nature of a specific relative pose problem, and outlines the complexity under different conditions. The algorithm shows state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. essential-matrix based solutions, and a frameto-frame application to a video sequence immediately leads to an alternative, real-time visual odometry solution.

<p>Author: Yinqiang Zheng, Yubin Kuang, Shigeki Sugimoto, Kalle Åström, Masatoshi Okutomi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the classical perspective-n-point (PnP) problem, and propose the first non-iterative O(n) solution that is fast, generally applicable and globally optimal. Our basic idea is to formulate the PnP problem into a functional minimization problem and retrieve all its stationary points by using the Gr¨ obner basis technique. The novelty lies in a non-unit quaternion representation to parameterize the rotation and a simple but elegant formulation of the PnP problem into an unconstrained optimization problem. Interestingly, the polynomial system arising from its first-order optimality condition assumes two-fold symmetry, a nice property that can be utilized to improve speed and numerical stability of a Gr¨ obner basis solver. Experiment results have demonstrated that, in terms of accuracy, our proposed solution is definitely better than the state-ofthe-art O(n) methods, and even comparable with the reprojection error minimization method.</p><p>6 0.63293874 <a title="184-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Content-Aware_Rotation.html">90 iccv-2013-Content-Aware Rotation</a></p>

<p>Author: Xu Wang, Stefan Atev, John Wright, Gilad Lerman</p><p>Abstract: The problem of efficiently deciding which of a database of models is most similar to a given input query arises throughout modern computer vision. Motivated by applications in recognition, image retrieval and optimization, there has been significant recent interest in the variant of this problem in which the database models are linear subspaces and the input is either a point or a subspace. Current approaches to this problem have poor scaling in high dimensions, and may not guarantee sublinear query complexity. We present a new approach to approximate nearest subspace search, based on a simple, new locality sensitive hash for subspaces. Our approach allows point-tosubspace query for a database of subspaces of arbitrary dimension d, in a time that depends sublinearly on the number of subspaces in the database. The query complexity of our algorithm is linear in the ambient dimension D, allow- ing it to be directly applied to high-dimensional imagery data. Numerical experiments on model problems in image repatching and automatic face recognition confirm the advantages of our algorithm in terms of both speed and accuracy.</p><p>2 0.97847271 <a title="184-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Toward_Guaranteed_Illumination_Models_for_Non-convex_Objects.html">422 iccv-2013-Toward Guaranteed Illumination Models for Non-convex Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuqian Zhang, Cun Mu, Han-Wen Kuo, John Wright</p><p>Abstract: Illumination variation remains a central challenge in object detection and recognition. Existing analyses of illumination variation typically pertain to convex, Lambertian objects, and guarantee quality of approximation in an average case sense. We show that it is possible to build models for the set of images across illumination variation with worstcase performance guarantees, for nonconvex Lambertian objects. Namely, a natural verification test based on the distance to the model guarantees to accept any image which can be sufficiently well-approximated by an image of the object under some admissible lighting condition, and guarantees to reject any image that does not have a sufficiently good approximation. These models are generated by sampling illumination directions with sufficient density, which follows from a new perturbation bound for directional illuminated images in the Lambertian model. As the number of such images required for guaranteed verification may be large, we introduce a new formulation for cone preserving dimensionality reduction, which leverages tools from sparse and low-rank decomposition to reduce the complexity, while controlling the approximation error with respect to the original model. 1</p><p>3 0.97658253 <a title="184-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Coupled_Dictionary_and_Feature_Space_Learning_with_Applications_to_Cross-Domain_Image_Synthesis_and_Recognition.html">96 iccv-2013-Coupled Dictionary and Feature Space Learning with Applications to Cross-Domain Image Synthesis and Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: De-An Huang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p><p>Abstract: Cross-domain image synthesis and recognition are typically considered as two distinct tasks in the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition. Therefore, it is not clear whether approaches addressing one task can be easily generalized or extended for solving the other. In this paper, we propose a unified model for coupled dictionary and feature space learning. The proposed learning model not only observes a common feature space for associating cross-domain image data for recognition purposes, the derived feature space is able to jointly update the dictionaries in each image domain for improved representation. This is why our method can be applied to both cross-domain image synthesis and recognition problems. Experiments on a variety of synthesis and recognition tasks such as single image super-resolution, cross-view action recognition, and sketchto-photo face recognition would verify the effectiveness of our proposed learning model.</p><p>4 0.97422463 <a title="184-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Cascaded_Shape_Space_Pruning_for_Robust_Facial_Landmark_Detection.html">70 iccv-2013-Cascaded Shape Space Pruning for Robust Facial Landmark Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaowei Zhao, Shiguang Shan, Xiujuan Chai, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel cascaded face shape space pruning algorithm for robust facial landmark detection. Through progressively excluding the incorrect candidate shapes, our algorithm can accurately and efficiently achieve the globally optimal shape configuration. Specifically, individual landmark detectors are firstly applied to eliminate wrong candidates for each landmark. Then, the candidate shape space is further pruned by jointly removing incorrect shape configurations. To achieve this purpose, a discriminative structure classifier is designed to assess the candidate shape configurations. Based on the learned discriminative structure classifier, an efficient shape space pruning strategy is proposed to quickly reject most incorrect candidate shapes while preserve the true shape. The proposed algorithm is carefully evaluated on a large set of real world face images. In addition, comparison results on the publicly available BioID and LFW face databases demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><p>5 0.96496743 <a title="184-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Finding_Causal_Interactions_in_Video_Sequences.html">167 iccv-2013-Finding Causal Interactions in Video Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Mustafa Ayazoglu, Burak Yilmaz, Mario Sznaier, Octavia Camps</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of detecting causal interactions in video clips. Specifically, the goal is to detect whether the actions of a given target can be explained in terms of the past actions of a collection of other agents. We propose to solve this problem by recasting it into a directed graph topology identification, where each node corresponds to the observed motion of a given target, and each link indicates the presence of a causal correlation. As shown in the paper, this leads to a block-sparsification problem that can be efficiently solved using a modified Group-Lasso type approach, capable of handling missing data and outliers (due for instance to occlusion and mis-identified correspondences). Moreover, this approach also identifies time instants where the interactions between agents change, thus providing event detection capabilities. These results are illustrated with several examples involving non–trivial interactions amongst several human subjects. 1. Introduction and Motivation The problem of identifying causal interactions amongst targets in a video sequence has been the focus of considerable attention in the past few years. A large portion of the existing body of work in this field uses human annotated video to build a storyline that includes both recognizing the activities involved and the causal relationships between them (see for instance [10] and references therein). While these methods are powerful and work well when suitably annotated data is available, annotating video clips is expensive and parsing relevant actions requires domain knowledge which may not be readily available. Indeed, in many situations, unveiling potentially hidden causal relationships is a first step towards building such knowledge. In this paper we consider the problem of identifying causal interactions amongst targets, not necessarily human, ∗This work was supported by NSF grants IIS–0713003, IIS-1318145, and ECCS–0901433, AFOSR grant FA9559–12–1–0271, and the Alert DHS Center of Excellence under Award Number 2008-ST-061-ED0001 . from unannotated video sequences and without prior domain knowledge. Our approach exploits the concept of “Granger Causality” [9], that formalizes the intuitive idea that ifa time series {x(t)} is causally related to a second one {thya(tt)if}a, ttihmene knowledge }oifs tchaeu past vrealluateesd otfo a{yse}c1to should l{eya(dt t}o, a ebnett kern prediction o thf efu ptuasret vvaalulueess ooff {{yx}}tt+k. In [l1ea4d], Pora ab bheatktearr eprt.e aicl.t successfully vuasleude a frequency domain reformulation of this concept to uncover pairwise interactions in scenarios involving repeating events, such as social games. This technique was later extended in [17] to model causal correlations between human joints and applied to the problem of activity classification. However, since this approach is based upon estimating the crosscovariance density function between events, it cannot handle situations where these events are non repeating, are too rare to provide an accurate estimate, or where these estimates are biased by outliers or missing data. Further, estimating a pairwise measure of causal correlation requires a spectral factorization of the cross-covariance, followed by numerical integration and statistical thresholding, limiting the approach to moderately large problems. To circumvent these problems, in this paper we propose an alternative approach based upon recasting the problem into that of identifying the topology of a sparse (directed) graph, where each node corresponds to the time traces of relevant features of a target, and each link corresponds to a regressor. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 1 using as an example the problem of finding causal relations amongst 4 tennis players, leading to a graph with 4 nodes, and potentially 12 (directed) links. Note that in general, the problem of identifying causal relationships is ill posed (unless one wants to identify the set of all individuals that could possibly have causal connections), due to the existence of secondary interactions. To illustrate this point, consider a very simplistic scenario with three actors A, B, and C, where A copies (with some delay) the actions of B, which in turn mimics C, also with some delay. In this situation, the ac- tions of A can be explained in terms of either those of B delayed one time sample, or those of C delayed by two samples. Thus, an algorithm based upon a statistical analysis 33556758 would identify a causal connection between A and C, even though there is no direct link between them. Further, if the actions of C can be explained by some simple autoregressive model of the form: = C(t) ?aiC(t − i) then it follows that the acti?ons of A can be explained by the same model, e.g. = A(t) ?aiA(t − i) Hence, multiple graphs topologies, some of which include self-loops, can explain the same set of time-series. On the other hand, note that in this situation, the sparsest graph (in the sense of having the fewest links) is the one that correctly captures the causality relations: the most direct cause of A is B and that of B is C, with C potentially being explained by a self-loop. To capture this feature and regularize the problem, in the sequel we will seek to find the sparsest graph, in the sense of having the least number of interconnections, that explains the observed data, reflecting the fact that, when alternative models are possible, often the most parsimonious is the correct one. Our main result shows that the problem of identifying sparse graph structures from observed noisy data can be reduced to a convex optimization problem (via the use of Group Lasso type arguments) that can be efficiently solved. The advantages of the proposed methods are: • • • • Its ability to handle complex scenarios involving nonrepeating events, een cvoimropnlmeexn stcael changes, clvoillnegct nioonnsof targets that do not necessarily split into well defined groups, outliers and missing data.

These algorithms have been shown to substantially outperform conventional convex-optimization solvers both in terms of memory and computation time requirements. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we provide a formal reformulation of the problem of finding causal relationships between agents as a sparse graph identification problem. In section 3, we show that this problem can be efficiently solved using a re-weighted Group Lasso approach. Moreover, as shown there, the resulting problem can be solved one node at a time using first order methods, which allows for handling situations involving a large number of agents. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated in section 4 using both simple scenarios (for which ground truth is readily available) and video clips of sports, involving complex, nonrepeating interactions amongst many agents.

Consider a scenario with P moving agents, and denote by the 3D homogenous coordinates of the pth individual at time t. Motivated by the idea of Granger Causality, we will say that the actions of this agent depend causally from those in a set Ip (which can possibly contain p itself), if can be written as: Q˜p(t) Q˜p(t) Q˜p(t) ?N = ? ?ajp(n)Q˜j(t − n) +˜ η p(t) +˜ u p(t) (1) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 Here ajp are unknown coefficients, and ˜η p(t) and up(t) represent measurement noise and a piecewise constant signal that is intended to account for relatively rare events that cannot be explained by the (past) actions of other agents. Examples include interactions of an agent with the environment, for instance to avoid obstacles, or changes in the interactions between agents. Since these events are infrequent, we will model as a signal that has (component-wise) a sparse derivative. Note in passing that since (1) involves homogeneous coordinates, the coefficients aj,p(.) satisfy the following constraint1 u ?N ? ?ajp(n) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 =1 (2) Our goal is to identify causal relationships using as data 2D measurements qp(t) in F frames of the affine projections of the 3D coordinates Q˜p(t) of the targets. Note that, under the affine camera assumption, the 2D coordinates are related exactly by the same regressor parameters [2]. Thus, (1) holds if and only if: ?N qp(t) = ? ?ajp(n)qj(t − n) + u˜ p(t) + ηp(t) (3) j?∈Ip ?n=0 In this context, the problem can be precisely stated as: Given qp(t) (in F number of frames) and some a-priori bound N on the order of the regressors (that is the “memory” of the interactions), find the sparsest set of equations of the form (3) that explains the data, that is: aj,pm,ηinp,up?nIp (4) subject to? ?(2) and: = ? ?ajp(n)qj(t − n) + ?N qp(t) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 up(t) + ηp(t) , p = 1 . . . , P and t = 1, ..F 1This follows by considering the third coordinate in (1) (5) where nIp denotes the cardinality of the set Ip.

For instance, [1] proposed a Lasso type algorithm to identify a sparse network where each link corresponds to a VAR process. The main idea underlying this method is to exploit the fact that penalizing the ?1 norm of the vector of regression coefficients tends to produce sparse solutions. However, enforcing sparsity of the entire vector of regressor coefficients does not necessarily result in a sparse graph structure, since the resulting solution can consist of many links, each with a few coefficients. This difficulty can be circumvented by resorting to group Lasso type approaches [18], which seek to enforce block sparsity by using a combination of ?1 and ?2 norm constraints on the coefficients of the regressor. While this approach was shown to work well with artificial data in [11], exact recovery of the underlying network can be only guaranteed when the data satisfies suitable “incoherence” type conditions [4]. Finally, a different approach was pursued in [13], based on the use of a modified Orthogonal Least Squares algorithm, Cyclic Orthogonal Least Squares. However, this approach requires enforcing an a-priori limit on the number of links allowed to point to a single node, and such information may not be readily available, specially in cases where this number has high variability amongst nodes. To address these difficulties, in the next section we develop a convex optimization based approach to the problem of identifying sparse graph structures from observed noisy data. This method is closest in spirit to that in [11], in the sense that it is also based on a group Lasso type argument. The main differences consist in the ability to handle the unknown inputs up(t), needed to model exogenous disturbances affecting the agents, and in a reformulation of the problem, that allows for using a re-weighted iterative type algorithm, leading to substantially sparser solutions, even when the conditions in [4] fail. 3. Causality Identification Algorithm In this section we present the main result of this paper, an algorithm to search for block-sparse solutions to (7). For each fixed p, the algorithm searches for sparse solutions to (6) by solving (iteratively) the following problem (suggested by the re-weighted heuristic proposed in [7]) ?P ap,muxipn,uypi?=1wja(?aip?2) + λ??diag(wu)[Δuxp;Δuyp]??1 subject to: ?ηp ? ≤ p = 1, . . , P. ∞ ?P ?, ?N ??aip(n) i?= ?1 ?n=0 ?. = 1, p = 1,...,P. (9) where [Δuxp ; Δuyp] represents the first order differences of the exogenous input vector [uxp ; uyp], Wa and Wu are weighting matrices, and λ is a Lagrange multiplier that plays the role of a tuning parameter between graph sparsity and event sensitivity. Intuitively, for a fixed set of weights w, the algorithm attempts to find a block sparse solution to (6) and a set of sparse inp?uts Δuxp ; Δuyp , by exploiting the facts that minimizing ?i ?aip ?2 (the ?2,1 norm of the vector sequence {aip}) te?nds? tao m?aximize block-sparsity [18], while minimizing et?nhed s? 1t norm mmaizxeim blizoceks sparsity [ [1168]]. wOhniclee t mheisnesolutions are found, the weights w are adjusted to penalize those elements of the sequences with small values, so that in the next iteration solutions that set these elements to zero (hence further increasing sparsity) are favored. Note however, that proceeding in this way, requires solving at each iteration a problem with n = P(Pnr + F) variables, where P and F denote the number of agents and frames, respectively, and where nr is a bound on the regressor order. On the other hand, it is easily seen that both the objective function and the constraints in (9) can be partitioned into P groups, with the pth group involving only the variables related to the pth node. It follows then that problem (9) can be solved by solving P smaller problems of the form: ?P ap,muxipn,uypi?=1wja(?aip?2) + λ??diag(wu)[Δuxp;Δuyp]??1 ?P subject to: ?ηp?∞ ?N ≤ ? and ??aip(n) i?= ?1 ?n=0 leading to the algorithm given below: =1 (10) Algorithm 1: REWEIGHTEDCAUSALITYALGORITHM for each p wa = [1, 1, ..., 1] = [1, 1, ..., 1] S > 1(self loop weight) s = [1, 1, ..., S, ..., 1] (p’th element is S) while not converged do 1. solve (9) 2. wja = 1/( ?aip ?2 + δ) 3. wja = wja ◦ s (Penalization self loops) 4. = 1./(abs([Δuxp ; Δuyp]) + δ) end while 5. At this point ajp(.) , Ip and up(t) have been identified end for wu wu It is worth emphasizing that, since the computational complexity of standard interior point methods grows as n3, solving these smaller P problems leads to roughly a O(P2) 33557781 reduction in computational time over solving a single, larger optimization. Thus, this approach can handle moderately large problems using standard, interior-point based, semidefinite optimization solvers. Larger problems can be accommodated by noting that the special form of the objective and constraints allow for using iterative Augmented La- grangian Type Methods (ALM), based upon computing, at each step, the closed form solution to suitable intermediate optimization problems. While a complete derivation of such an algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper, using results from [12] it can be shown that each step requires only a combination of thresholding and least-squares approximations. Moreover, it can be shown that such an algorithm converges Q-superlinearly. 4. Handling Outliers and Missing Data The algorithm outlined above assumes an ideal situation where the data matrix B is perfectly known. However, in practice many of its elements may be outliers (due to misidentified correspondences) or missing (due to occlusion). As we briefly show next, these situations can be efficiently handled by performing a structured robust PCA step [3] to obtain a “clean” data matrix, prior to applying Algorithm 1. From equation (6) it follows that, in the absence of exogenous inputs and noise: ?xy11.. . .yxPP? = ?XY11.. . .YXPP? ?a1...aP? (11) Since xi ∈ {col(Xj)} and yi ∈ {col(Yj }), it follows that the sets {∈co {l(cXoli(X)} a)n}d a n{dco yl(Y∈i) { }c? are self-ex?pressive, or, ?equivalently?, Xthe }ma atnridce {sc oXl( =.) }? aXre1 . . . fX-eNxp? eanssdiv eY, ?Y1 ...YN? are mraantkri cdeesfic Xient. ?Consider no?w the case =.r, w?here some ?elements xi, yi of X and Y are missing.

Experimental Results In this section we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using several video clips (provided as supplemental material). The results of the experiments are displayed using graphs embedded on the video frames: An arrow indicates causal correlation between agents, with the point of the arrow indicating the agent whose actions are affected by the agent at its tail. The internal parameters of the algorithm were experimentally tuned, leading to the values ? = 0.1, = 0.05, self loop weights S = 10. The algorithm is fairly insensitive to the value of the regularization parameters and S, which could be adjusted up or down by an order of magnitude without affecting the structure of the resulting graph. Finally, we used regressor order N=2 for the first three examples and N=4 for the last one, a choice that is consistent with the frame rate and the complexity of λ λ the actions taking place in each clip. 5.1. Clips from the UT-Interaction Data Set We considered two video clips from the UT Human Interaction Data Set [15] (sequences 6 and 16). Figures 2 and 5 compare the results obtained applying the proposed algorithm versus Group Lasso (GL) [11] and Group Lasso combined with the reweighted heuristic described in (9) (GLRW). In all cases, the inputs to the algorithm were the (approximate) coordinates of the heads of each of the agents, normalized to the interval [−1, 1], artificially corrupted ,w niothrm m10al%iz eodut tloie trhs.e Notably, [t−he1 proposed algorithm 2As shown in [6, 8] under suitable conditions these relaxations the exact minimum rank solution. 33557792 recover Figure 2.

Only the proposed method identifies the correct connections. was able to correctly identify the correlations between the agents from this very limited amount of information, while the others failed to do so. Note in passing that in both cases none of the algorithms were directly applicable, due to some of the individuals leaving the field of view or being occluded. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the missing data was recovered by solving an RPCA problem prior to applying Algorithm 1. Finally, Fig. 4 sheds more insight on the key role played by the sparse signal u. As shown there, changes in u correspond exactly to time instants when the behavior of the corresponding agent deviates from the general pattern followed during most of the clip. Figure 3. Time traces of the individual heads in the UT sequence 6, artificially corrupted with 10 % outliers. The outliers were removed and the missing data due to targets leaving the field of view was estimated solving a modified RPCA problem. Frame number Figure 4.

Doubles Tennis Experiment This experiment considers a non-staged real-life scenario. The data consists of 230 frames of a video clip from the Australian Open Tennis Doubles Final games. The goal here is to identify causal relationships between the different players using time traces of the respective centroid positions. Note that in this case the ground truth is not available. Nevertheless, since players from the same team usually look at their opponents and react to their motions, we expect a strong causality connection between members of 33557803 opposite teams. This intuition is matched by the correlations unveiled by the algorithm, shown in Fig. 6. The identified sparse input corresponding to the vertical direction is shown in Fig. 7 (similar results for the horizontal component are omitted due to space reasons.) Figure 6. Sample frames from the tennis sequence. Top: The proposed method correctly identifies interactions between opposite team members. Center: Reweighted Group Lasso misses the interaction between the two rear-most individuals of opposite teams, generating self loops instead (denoted by the disks). Bottom: Group Lasso yields an almost complete graph. Figure 7. Exogenous signal corresponding to the vertical axis for the tennis sequence. The change in one component corresponds to the instant when the leftmost player in the bottom team moves from the line towards the net, remaining closer to it from then on. 5.3. Basketball Game Experiment This experiment considers the interactions amongst players in a basketball game. As in the case ofthe tennis players, since the data comes from a real life scenario, the ground truth is not available. However, contrary to the tennis game, this scenario involves complex interactions amongst many players, and causality is hard to discern by inspection. Nevertheless, the results shown in Fig. 8, obtained using the position of the centroids as inputs to our algorithm, match our intuition. Firstly, one would expect a strong cause/effect connection between the actions of the player with the ball and the two defending opponents facing him. These connections (denoted by the yellow arrows) were indeed successfully identified by the algorithm. The next set of causal correlations is represented by the (blue, light green) and (black, white) arrow pairs showing the defending and the opponent players on the far side of the field and under the hoop. An important, counterintuitive, connection identified by the algorithm is represented by the magenta arrows be- tween the right winger of the white team with two of his teammates: the one holding the ball and the one running behind all players. While at first sight this connection is not as obvious as the others, it becomes apparent towards the end of the sequence, when the right winger player is signaling with a raised arm. Notably, our algorithm was able to unveil this signaling without the need to perform a semantic analysis (a very difficult task here, since this signaling is apparent only in the last few frames). Rather, it used the fact that the causal correlation was encapsulated in the dynamics of the relative motions of these players. 6. Conclusions In this paper we propose a new method for detecting causal interactions between agents using video data. The main idea is to recast this problem into a blind directed graph topology identification, where each node corresponds to the observed motion of a given target, each link indicates the presence of a causal correlation and the unknown inputs account for changes in the interaction patterns. In turn, this problem can be reduced to that of finding block-sparse solutions to a set of linear equations, which can be efficiently accomplished using an iterative re-weighted Group-Lasso approach. The ability of the algorithm to correctly identify causal correlations, even in cases where portions of the data record are missing or corrupted by outliers, and the key role played by the unknown exogenous input were illustrated with several examples involving non–trivial inter- actions amongst several human subjects. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm was able to identify both the correct interactions and the time instants when interactions amongst agents changed, based on minimal motion information: in all cases we used just a single time trace per person. This success indicates that in many scenarios, the dynamic information contained in the motion pattern of a single feature associated with a target is rich enough to enable identifying complex interaction patterns, without the need to track multiple features, perform a semantic analysis or use additional domain knowledge. 33557814 Figure 8.

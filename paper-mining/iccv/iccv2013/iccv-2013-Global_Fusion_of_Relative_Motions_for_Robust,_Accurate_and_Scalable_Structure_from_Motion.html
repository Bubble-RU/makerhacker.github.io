<p>Author: Nianjuan Jiang, Zhaopeng Cui, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We present a linear method for global camera pose registration from pairwise relative poses encoded in essential matrices. Our method minimizes an approximate geometric error to enforce the triangular relationship in camera triplets. This formulation does not suffer from the typical ‘unbalanced scale ’ problem in linear methods relying on pairwise translation direction constraints, i.e. an algebraic error; nor the system degeneracy from collinear motion. In the case of three cameras, our method provides a good linear approximation of the trifocal tensor. It can be directly scaled up to register multiple cameras. The results obtained are accurate for point triangulation and can serve as a good initialization for final bundle adjustment. We evaluate the algorithm performance with different types of data and demonstrate its effectiveness. Our system produces good accuracy, robustness, and outperforms some well-known systems on efficiency.</p><p>3 0.28927532 <a title="184-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Kneip, Simon Lynen</p><p>Abstract: This work makes use of a novel, recently proposed epipolar constraint for computing the relative pose between two calibrated images. By enforcing the coplanarity of epipolar plane normal vectors, it constrains the three degrees of freedom of the relative rotation between two camera views directly—independently of the translation. The present paper shows how the approach can be extended to n points, and translated into an efficient eigenvalue minimization over the three rotational degrees of freedom. Each iteration in the non-linear optimization has constant execution time, independently of the number of features. Two global optimization approaches are proposed. The first one consists of an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt scheme with randomized initial value, which already leads to stable and accurate results. The second scheme consists of a globally optimal branch-and-bound algorithm based on a bound on the eigenvalue variation derived from symmetric eigenvalue-perturbation theory. Analysis of the cost function reveals insights into the nature of a specific relative pose problem, and outlines the complexity under different conditions. The algorithm shows state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. essential-matrix based solutions, and a frameto-frame application to a video sequence immediately leads to an alternative, real-time visual odometry solution.

<p>Author: Jin Gao, Junliang Xing, Weiming Hu, Steve Maybank</p><p>Abstract: Visual tracking has witnessed growing methods in object representation, which is crucial to robust tracking. The dominant mechanism in object representation is using image features encoded in a vector as observations to perform tracking, without considering that an image is intrinsically a matrix, or a 2nd-order tensor. Thus approaches following this mechanism inevitably lose a lot of useful information, and therefore cannot fully exploit the spatial correlations within the 2D image ensembles. In this paper, we address an image as a 2nd-order tensor in its original form, and find a discriminative linear embedding space approximation to the original nonlinear submanifold embedded in the tensor space based on the graph embedding framework. We specially design two graphs for characterizing the intrinsic local geometrical structure of the tensor space, so as to retain more discriminant information when reducing the dimension along certain tensor dimensions. However, spatial correlations within a tensor are not limited to the elements along these dimensions. This means that some part of the discriminant information may not be encoded in the embedding space. We introduce a novel technique called semi-supervised improvement to iteratively adjust the embedding space to compensate for the loss of discriminant information, hence improving the performance of our tracker. Experimental results on challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker.</p><p>5 0.17709911 <a title="184-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-SUN3D%3A_A_Database_of_Big_Spaces_Reconstructed_Using_SfM_and_Object_Labels.html">367 iccv-2013-SUN3D: A Database of Big Spaces Reconstructed Using SfM and Object Labels</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxiong Xiao, Andrew Owens, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: Existing scene understanding datasets contain only a limited set of views of a place, and they lack representations of complete 3D spaces. In this paper, we introduce SUN3D, a large-scale RGB-D video database with camera pose and object labels, capturing the full 3D extent of many places. The tasks that go into constructing such a dataset are difficult in isolation hand-labeling videos is painstaking, and structure from motion (SfM) is unreliable for large spaces. But if we combine them together, we make the dataset construction task much easier. First, we introduce an intuitive labeling tool that uses a partial reconstruction to propagate labels from one frame to another. Then we use the object labels to fix errors in the reconstruction. For this, we introduce a generalization of bundle adjustment that incorporates object-to-object correspondences. This algorithm works by constraining points for the same object from different frames to lie inside a fixed-size bounding box, parameterized by its rotation and translation. The SUN3D database, the source code for the generalized bundle adjustment, and the web-based 3D annotation tool are all avail– able at http://sun3d.cs.princeton.edu.</p><p>6 0.17422073 <a title="184-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_and_Robust_Large-Scale_Rotation_Averaging.html">138 iccv-2013-Efficient and Robust Large-Scale Rotation Averaging</a></p>

<p>Author: Avishek Chatterjee, Venu Madhav Govindu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of robust and efficient averaging of relative 3D rotations. Apart from having an interesting geometric structure, robust rotation averaging addresses the need for a good initialization for largescale optimization used in structure-from-motion pipelines. Such pipelines often use unstructured image datasets harvested from the internet thereby requiring an initialization method that is robust to outliers. Our approach works on the Lie group structure of 3D rotations and solves the problem of large-scale robust rotation averaging in two ways. Firstly, we use modern ?1 optimizers to carry out robust averaging of relative rotations that is efficient, scalable and robust to outliers. In addition, we also develop a twostep method that uses the ?1 solution as an initialisation for an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach. These methods achieve excellent results on large-scale, real world datasets and significantly outperform existing methods, i.e. the state-of-the-art discrete-continuous optimization method of [3] as well as the Weiszfeld method of [8]. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two large- scale real world datasets and also provide the results of the two aforementioned methods for comparison.</p><p>4 0.74356973 <a title="184-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kaiming He, Huiwen Chang, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: We present an image editing tool called Content-Aware Rotation. Casually shot photos can appear tilted, and are often corrected by rotation and cropping. This trivial solution may remove desired content and hurt image integrity. Instead of doing rigid rotation, we propose a warping method that creates the perception of rotation and avoids cropping. Human vision studies suggest that the perception of rotation is mainly due to horizontal/vertical lines. We design an optimization-based method that preserves the rotation of horizontal/vertical lines, maintains the completeness of the image content, and reduces the warping distortion. An efficient algorithm is developed to address the challenging optimization. We demonstrate our content-aware rotation method on a variety of practical cases.</p><p>6 0.6430071 <a title="184-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Go-ICP%3A_Solving_3D_Registration_Efficiently_and_Globally_Optimally.html">185 iccv-2013-Go-ICP: Solving 3D Registration Efficiently and Globally Optimally</a></p>

<p>Author: Pierre Moulon, Pascal Monasse, Renaud Marlet</p><p>Abstract: Multi-view structure from motion (SfM) estimates the position and orientation of pictures in a common 3D coordinate frame. When views are treated incrementally, this external calibration can be subject to drift, contrary to global methods that distribute residual errors evenly. We propose a new global calibration approach based on the fusion of relative motions between image pairs. We improve an existing method for robustly computing global rotations. We present an efficient a contrario trifocal tensor estimation method, from which stable and precise translation directions can be extracted. We also define an efficient translation registration method that recovers accurate camera positions. These components are combined into an original SfM pipeline. Our experiments show that, on most datasets, it outperforms in accuracy other existing incremental and global pipelines. It also achieves strikingly good running times: it is about 20 times faster than the other global method we could compare to, and as fast as the best incremental method. More importantly, it features better scalability properties.</p><p>2 0.78570521 <a title="184-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-A_Generalized_Low-Rank_Appearance_Model_for_Spatio-temporally_Correlated_Rain_Streaks.html">15 iccv-2013-A Generalized Low-Rank Appearance Model for Spatio-temporally Correlated Rain Streaks</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi-Lei Chen, Chiou-Ting Hsu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank appearance model for removing rain streaks. Different from previous work, our method needs neither rain pixel detection nor time-consuming dictionary learning stage. Instead, as rain streaks usually reveal similar and repeated patterns on imaging scene, we propose and generalize a low-rank model from matrix to tensor structure in order to capture the spatio-temporally correlated rain streaks. With the appearance model, we thus remove rain streaks from image/video (and also other high-order image structure) in a unified way. Our experimental results demonstrate competitive (or even better) visual quality and efficient run-time in comparison with state of the art.</p><p>3 0.74073517 <a title="184-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Orderless_Tracking_through_Model-Averaged_Posterior_Estimation.html">303 iccv-2013-Orderless Tracking through Model-Averaged Posterior Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Seunghoon Hong, Suha Kwak, Bohyung Han</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel offline tracking algorithm based on model-averaged posterior estimation through patch matching across frames. Contrary to existing online and offline tracking methods, our algorithm is not based on temporallyordered estimates of target state but attempts to select easyto-track frames first out of the remaining ones without exploiting temporal coherency of target. The posterior of the selected frame is estimated by propagating densities from the already tracked frames in a recursive manner. The density propagation across frames is implemented by an efficient patch matching technique, which is useful for our algorithm since it does not require motion smoothness assumption. Also, we present a hierarchical approach, where a small set of key frames are tracked first and non-key frames are handled by local key frames. Our tracking algorithm is conceptually well-suited for the sequences with abrupt motion, shot changes, and occlusion. We compare our tracking algorithm with existing techniques in real videos with such challenges and illustrate its superior performance qualitatively and quantitatively.</p><p>4 0.74037576 <a title="184-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Motion_for_Every_Visible_Point.html">441 iccv-2013-Video Motion for Every Visible Point</a></p>
<p>Author: Susanna Ricco, Carlo Tomasi</p><p>Abstract: Dense motion of image points over many video frames can provide important information about the world. However, occlusions and drift make it impossible to compute long motionpaths by merely concatenating opticalflow vectors between consecutive frames. Instead, we solve for entire paths directly, and flag the frames in which each is visible. As in previous work, we anchor each path to a unique pixel which guarantees an even spatial distribution of paths. Unlike earlier methods, we allow paths to be anchored in any frame. By explicitly requiring that at least one visible path passes within a small neighborhood of every pixel, we guarantee complete coverage of all visible points in all frames. We achieve state-of-the-art results on real sequences including both rigid and non-rigid motions with significant occlusions.</p><p>5 0.7347734 <a title="184-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-STAR3D%3A_Simultaneous_Tracking_and_Reconstruction_of_3D_Objects_Using_RGB-D_Data.html">366 iccv-2013-STAR3D: Simultaneous Tracking and Reconstruction of 3D Objects Using RGB-D Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Yuheng Ren, Victor Prisacariu, David Murray, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a probabilistic framework for simultaneous tracking and reconstruction of 3D rigid objects using an RGB-D camera. The tracking problem is handled using a bag-of-pixels representation and a back-projection scheme. Surface and background appearance models are learned online, leading to robust tracking in the presence of heavy occlusion and outliers. In both our tracking and reconstruction modules, the 3D object is implicitly embedded using a 3D level-set function. The framework is initialized with a simple shape primitive model (e.g. a sphere or a cube), and the real 3D object shape is tracked and reconstructed online. Unlike existing depth-based 3D reconstruction works, which either rely on calibrated/fixed camera set up or use the observed world map to track the depth camera, our framework can simultaneously track and reconstruct small moving objects. We use both qualitative and quantitative results to demonstrate the superior performance of both tracking and reconstruction of our method.</p><p>6 0.73276526 <a title="184-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Facial_Action_Unit_Event_Detection_by_Cascade_of_Tasks.html">155 iccv-2013-Facial Action Unit Event Detection by Cascade of Tasks</a></p>

<p>Author: Fatemeh Mirrashed, Mohammad Rastegari</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method that exploits intrinsic compact structures of categories across different domains using binary attributes. Our method directly optimizes for classification in the target domain. The key insight is finding attributes that are discriminative across categories and predictable across domains.

<p>Author: Basura Fernando, Amaury Habrard, Marc Sebban, Tinne Tuytelaars</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new domain adaptation (DA) algorithm where the source and target domains are represented by subspaces described by eigenvectors. In this context, our method seeks a domain adaptation solution by learning a mapping function which aligns the source subspace with the target one. We show that the solution of the corresponding optimization problem can be obtained in a simple closed form, leading to an extremely fast algorithm. We use a theoretical result to tune the unique hyperparameter corresponding to the size of the subspaces. We run our method on various datasets and show that, despite its intrinsic simplicity, it outperforms state of the art DA methods.</p><p>4 0.24089471 <a title="435-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Domain_Transfer_Support_Vector_Ranking_for_Person_Re-identification_without_Target_Camera_Label_Information.html">124 iccv-2013-Domain Transfer Support Vector Ranking for Person Re-identification without Target Camera Label Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Andy J. Ma, Pong C. Yuen, Jiawei Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses a new person re-identification problem without the label information of persons under non-overlapping target cameras. Given the matched (positive) and unmatched (negative) image pairs from source domain cameras, as well as unmatched (negative) image pairs which can be easily generated from target domain cameras, we propose a Domain Transfer Ranked Support Vector Machines (DTRSVM) method for re-identification under target domain cameras. To overcome the problems introduced due to the absence of matched (positive) image pairs in target domain, we relax the discriminative constraint to a necessary condition only relying on the positive mean in target domain. By estimating the target positive mean using source and target domain data, a new discriminative model with high confidence in target positive mean and low confidence in target negative image pairs is developed. Since the necessary condition may not truly preserve the discriminability, multi-task support vector ranking is proposed to incorporate the training data from source domain with label information. Experimental results show that the proposed DTRSVM outperforms existing methods without using label information in target cameras. And the top 30 rank accuracy can be improved by the proposed method upto 9.40% on publicly available person re-identification datasets.</p><p>5 0.19553649 <a title="435-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Frustratingly_Easy_NBNN_Domain_Adaptation.html">181 iccv-2013-Frustratingly Easy NBNN Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tatiana Tommasi, Barbara Caputo</p><p>Abstract: Over the last years, several authors have signaled that state of the art categorization methods fail to perform well when trained and tested on data from different databases. The general consensus in the literature is that this issue, known as domain adaptation and/or dataset bias, is due to a distribution mismatch between data collections. Methods addressing it go from max-margin classifiers to learning how to modify the features and obtain a more robust representation. The large majority of these works use BOW feature descriptors, and learning methods based on imageto-image distance functions. Following the seminal work of [6], in this paper we challenge these two assumptions. We experimentally show that using the NBNN classifier over existing domain adaptation databases achieves always very strong performances. We build on this result, and present an NBNN-based domain adaptation algorithm that learns iteratively a class metric while inducing, for each sample, a large margin separation among classes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work casting the domain adaptation problem within the NBNN framework. Experiments show that our method achieves the state of the art, both in the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.</p><p>6 0.19291744 <a title="435-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Transfer_Feature_Learning_with_Joint_Distribution_Adaptation.html">427 iccv-2013-Transfer Feature Learning with Joint Distribution Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang, Guiguang Ding, Jiaguang Sun, Philip S. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Transfer learning is established as an effective technology in computer visionfor leveraging rich labeled data in the source domain to build an accurate classifier for the target domain. However, most prior methods have not simultaneously reduced the difference in both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution between domains. In this paper, we put forward a novel transfer learning approach, referred to as Joint Distribution Adaptation (JDA). Specifically, JDA aims to jointly adapt both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution in a principled dimensionality reduction procedure, and construct new feature representation that is effective and robustfor substantial distribution difference. Extensive experiments verify that JDA can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art methods on four types of cross-domain image classification problems.</p><p>6 0.84506351 <a title="435-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Frustratingly_Easy_NBNN_Domain_Adaptation.html">181 iccv-2013-Frustratingly Easy NBNN Domain Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthijs Douze, Jérôme Revaud, Cordelia Schmid, Hervé Jégou</p><p>Abstract: This paper makes two complementary contributions to event retrieval in large collections of videos. First, we propose hyper-pooling strategies that encode the frame descriptors into a representation of the video sequence in a stable manner. Our best choices compare favorably with regular pooling techniques based on k-means quantization. Second, we introduce a technique to improve the ranking. It can be interpreted either as a query expansion method or as a similarity adaptation based on the local context of the query video descriptor. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our methods are complementary and improve event retrieval results, without sacrificing efficiency.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.70312917 <a title="435-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_by_Domain_Invariant_Projection.html">435 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Domain Invariant Projection</a></p>

To track objects accurately in such situation, the proposed method uses “motion saliency ” and “descriptor saliency ” of local features and performs tracking based on generalized Hough transform (GHT). The proposed motion saliency of a local feature emphasizes features having distinctive motions, compared to the motions which are not from the target object. The descriptor saliency emphasizes features which are likely to be of the object in terms of its feature descriptors. Through these saliencies, the proposed method tries to “learn and find” the target object rather than looking for what was given at initialization, giving robust results even with inaccurate initializations. Also, our tracking result is obtained by combining the results of each local feature of the target and the surroundings with GHT voting, thus is robust against severe occlusions as well. The proposed method is compared against nine other methods, with nine image sequences, and hundred random initializations. The experimental results show that our method outperforms all other compared methods.</p><p>4 0.63526261 <a title="435-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Network_Principles_for_SfM%3A_Disambiguating_Repeated_Structures_with_Local_Context.html">289 iccv-2013-Network Principles for SfM: Disambiguating Repeated Structures with Local Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Kyle Wilson, Noah Snavely</p><p>Abstract: Repeated features are common in urban scenes. Many objects, such as clock towers with nearly identical sides, or domes with strong radial symmetries, pose challenges for structure from motion. When similar but distinct features are mistakenly equated, the resulting 3D reconstructions can have errors ranging from phantom walls and superimposed structures to a complete failure to reconstruct. We present a new approach to solving such problems by considering the local visibility structure of such repeated features. Drawing upon network theory, we present a new way of scoring features using a measure of local clustering. Our model leads to a simple, fast, and highly scalable technique for disambiguating repeated features based on an analysis of an underlying visibility graph, without relying on explicit geometric reasoning. We demonstrate our method on several very large datasets drawn from Internet photo collections, and compare it to a more traditional geometry-based disambiguation technique.</p><p>5 0.62876481 <a title="435-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Transfer_Feature_Learning_with_Joint_Distribution_Adaptation.html">427 iccv-2013-Transfer Feature Learning with Joint Distribution Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang, Guiguang Ding, Jiaguang Sun, Philip S. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Transfer learning is established as an effective technology in computer visionfor leveraging rich labeled data in the source domain to build an accurate classifier for the target domain. However, most prior methods have not simultaneously reduced the difference in both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution between domains. In this paper, we put forward a novel transfer learning approach, referred to as Joint Distribution Adaptation (JDA). Specifically, JDA aims to jointly adapt both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution in a principled dimensionality reduction procedure, and construct new feature representation that is effective and robustfor substantial distribution difference. Extensive experiments verify that JDA can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art methods on four types of cross-domain image classification problems.</p><p>6 0.62610376 <a title="435-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Similarity_Metric_Learning_for_Face_Recognition.html">392 iccv-2013-Similarity Metric Learning for Face Recognition</a></p>

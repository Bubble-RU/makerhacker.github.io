<p>Author: Byung-Soo Kim, Pushmeet Kohli, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: Scene understanding is an important yet very challenging problem in computer vision. In the past few years, researchers have taken advantage of the recent diffusion of depth-RGB (RGB-D) cameras to help simplify the problem of inferring scene semantics. However, while the added 3D geometry is certainly useful to segment out objects with different depth values, it also adds complications in that the 3D geometry is often incorrect because of noisy depth measurements and the actual 3D extent of the objects is usually unknown because of occlusions. In this paper we propose a new method that allows us to jointly refine the 3D reconstruction of the scene (raw depth values) while accurately segmenting out the objects or scene elements from the 3D reconstruction. This is achieved by introducing a new model which we called Voxel-CRF. The Voxel-CRF model is based on the idea of constructing a conditional random field over a 3D volume of interest which captures the semantic and 3D geometric relationships among different elements (voxels) of the scene. Such model allows to jointly estimate (1) a dense voxel-based 3D reconstruction and (2) the semantic labels associated with each voxel even in presence of par- tial occlusions using an approximate yet efficient inference strategy. We evaluated our method on the challenging NYU Depth dataset (Version 1and 2). Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive accuracy in inferring scene semantics and visually appealing results in improving the quality of the 3D reconstruction. We also demonstrate an interesting application of object removal and scene completion from RGB-D images.</p><p>3 0.38686192 <a title="366-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Large-Scale_Multi-resolution_Surface_Reconstruction_from_RGB-D_Sequences.html">228 iccv-2013-Large-Scale Multi-resolution Surface Reconstruction from RGB-D Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Steinbrücker, Christian Kerl, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to generate highly detailed, textured 3D models of large environments from RGB-D sequences. Our system runs in real-time on a standard desktop PC with a state-of-the-art graphics card. To reduce the memory consumption, we fuse the acquired depth maps and colors in a multi-scale octree representation of a signed distance function. To estimate the camera poses, we construct a pose graph and use dense image alignment to determine the relative pose between pairs of frames. We add edges between nodes when we detect loop-closures and optimize the pose graph to correct for long-term drift. Our implementation is highly parallelized on graphics hardware to achieve real-time performance. More specifically, we can reconstruct, store, and continuously update a colored 3D model of an entire corridor of nine rooms at high levels of detail in real-time on a single GPU with 2.5GB.</p><p>4 0.26761514 <a title="366-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Tracking_Revisited_Using_RGBD_Camera%3A_Unified_Benchmark_and_Baselines.html">424 iccv-2013-Tracking Revisited Using RGBD Camera: Unified Benchmark and Baselines</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuran Song, Jianxiong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Despite significant progress, tracking is still considered to be a very challenging task. Recently, the increasing popularity of depth sensors has made it possible to obtain reliable depth easily. This may be a game changer for tracking, since depth can be used to prevent model drift and handle occlusion. We also observe that current tracking algorithms are mostly evaluated on a very small number of videos collectedandannotated by different groups. The lack of a reasonable size and consistently constructed benchmark has prevented a persuasive comparison among different algorithms. In this paper, we construct a unified benchmark dataset of 100 RGBD videos with high diversity, propose different kinds of RGBD tracking algorithms using 2D or 3D model, and present a quantitative comparison of various algorithms with RGB or RGBD input. We aim to lay the foundation for further research in both RGB and RGBD tracking, and our benchmark is available at http://tracking.cs.princeton.edu.</p><p>5 0.25595197 <a title="366-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Real-Time_Body_Tracking_with_One_Depth_Camera_and_Inertial_Sensors.html">341 iccv-2013-Real-Time Body Tracking with One Depth Camera and Inertial Sensors</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Helten, Meinard Müller, Hans-Peter Seidel, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, the availability of inexpensive depth cameras, such as the Microsoft Kinect, has boosted the research in monocular full body skeletal pose tracking. Unfortunately, existing trackers often fail to capture poses where a single camera provides insufficient data, such as non-frontal poses, and all other poses with body part occlusions. In this paper, we present a novel sensor fusion approach for real-time full body tracking that succeeds in such difficult situations. It takes inspiration from previous tracking solutions, and combines a generative tracker and a discriminative tracker retrieving closest poses in a database. In contrast to previous work, both trackers employ data from a low number of inexpensive body-worn inertial sensors. These sensors provide reliable and complementary information when the monocular depth information alone is not sufficient. We also contribute by new algorithmic solutions to best fuse depth and inertial data in both trackers. One is a new visibility model to determine global body pose, occlusions and usable depth correspondences and to decide what data modality to use for discriminative tracking. We also contribute with a new inertial-basedpose retrieval, and an adapted late fusion step to calculate the final body pose.</p><p>6 0.24594323 <a title="366-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Robust_Non-negative_Dictionary_Learning_for_Visual_Tracking.html">298 iccv-2013-Online Robust Non-negative Dictionary Learning for Visual Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Diego Thomas, Akihiro Sugimoto</p><p>Abstract: Updating a global 3D model with live RGB-D measurements has proven to be successful for 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes. Recently, a Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) volumetric model and a fusion algorithm have been introduced (KinectFusion), showing significant advantages such as computational speed and accuracy of the reconstructed scene. This algorithm, however, is expensive in memory when constructing and updating the global model. As a consequence, the method is not well scalable to large scenes. We propose a new flexible 3D scene representation using a set of planes that is cheap in memory use and, nevertheless, achieves accurate reconstruction of indoor scenes from RGB-D image sequences. Projecting the scene onto different planes reduces significantly the size of the scene representation and thus it allows us to generate a global textured 3D model with lower memory requirement while keeping accuracy and easiness to update with live RGB-D measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed flexible 3D scene representation achieves accurate reconstruction, while keeping the scalability for large indoor scenes.</p><p>5 0.66584045 <a title="366-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Point-Based_3D_Reconstruction_of_Thin_Objects.html">319 iccv-2013-Point-Based 3D Reconstruction of Thin Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Ummenhofer, Thomas Brox</p><p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction deals with the problem of finding the shape of an object from a set of images. Thin objects that have virtually no volumepose a special challengefor reconstruction with respect to shape representation and fusion of depth information. In this paper we present a dense pointbased reconstruction method that can deal with this special class of objects. We seek to jointly optimize a set of depth maps by treating each pixel as a point in space. Points are pulled towards a common surface by pairwise forces in an iterative scheme. The method also handles the problem of opposed surfaces by means of penalty forces. Efficient optimization is achieved by grouping points to superpixels and a spatial hashing approach for fast neighborhood queries. We show that the approach is on a par with state-of-the-art methods for standard multi view stereo settings and gives superior results for thin objects.</p><p>6 0.66198564 <a title="366-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Live_Metric_3D_Reconstruction_on_Mobile_Phones.html">254 iccv-2013-Live Metric 3D Reconstruction on Mobile Phones</a></p>

<p>Author: Susanna Ricco, Carlo Tomasi</p><p>Abstract: Dense motion of image points over many video frames can provide important information about the world. However, occlusions and drift make it impossible to compute long motionpaths by merely concatenating opticalflow vectors between consecutive frames. Instead, we solve for entire paths directly, and flag the frames in which each is visible. As in previous work, we anchor each path to a unique pixel which guarantees an even spatial distribution of paths. Unlike earlier methods, we allow paths to be anchored in any frame. By explicitly requiring that at least one visible path passes within a small neighborhood of every pixel, we guarantee complete coverage of all visible points in all frames. We achieve state-of-the-art results on real sequences including both rigid and non-rigid motions with significant occlusions.</p><p>2 0.8994354 <a title="366-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Data_Association%3A_Bayesian_Model_Selection_for_Multi-target_Tracking.html">230 iccv-2013-Latent Data Association: Bayesian Model Selection for Multi-target Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Aleksandr V. Segal, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel parametrization of the data association problem for multi-target tracking. In our formulation, the number of targets is implicitly inferred together with the data association, effectively solving data association and model selection as a single inference problem. The novel formulation allows us to interpret data association and tracking as a single Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS). We compute an approximate posterior solution to this problem using a dynamic programming/message passing technique. This inference-based approach allows us to incorporate richer probabilistic models into the tracking system. In particular, we incorporate inference over inliers/outliers and track termination times into the system. We evaluate our approach on publicly available datasets and demonstrate results competitive with, and in some cases exceeding the state of the art.</p><p>3 0.89823592 <a title="366-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Global_Fusion_of_Relative_Motions_for_Robust%2C_Accurate_and_Scalable_Structure_from_Motion.html">184 iccv-2013-Global Fusion of Relative Motions for Robust, Accurate and Scalable Structure from Motion</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Moulon, Pascal Monasse, Renaud Marlet</p><p>Abstract: Multi-view structure from motion (SfM) estimates the position and orientation of pictures in a common 3D coordinate frame. When views are treated incrementally, this external calibration can be subject to drift, contrary to global methods that distribute residual errors evenly. We propose a new global calibration approach based on the fusion of relative motions between image pairs. We improve an existing method for robustly computing global rotations. We present an efficient a contrario trifocal tensor estimation method, from which stable and precise translation directions can be extracted. We also define an efficient translation registration method that recovers accurate camera positions. These components are combined into an original SfM pipeline. Our experiments show that, on most datasets, it outperforms in accuracy other existing incremental and global pipelines. It also achieves strikingly good running times: it is about 20 times faster than the other global method we could compare to, and as fast as the best incremental method. More importantly, it features better scalability properties.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.8958087 <a title="366-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-STAR3D%3A_Simultaneous_Tracking_and_Reconstruction_of_3D_Objects_Using_RGB-D_Data.html">366 iccv-2013-STAR3D: Simultaneous Tracking and Reconstruction of 3D Objects Using RGB-D Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Yuheng Ren, Victor Prisacariu, David Murray, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a probabilistic framework for simultaneous tracking and reconstruction of 3D rigid objects using an RGB-D camera. The tracking problem is handled using a bag-of-pixels representation and a back-projection scheme. Surface and background appearance models are learned online, leading to robust tracking in the presence of heavy occlusion and outliers. In both our tracking and reconstruction modules, the 3D object is implicitly embedded using a 3D level-set function. The framework is initialized with a simple shape primitive model (e.g. a sphere or a cube), and the real 3D object shape is tracked and reconstructed online. Unlike existing depth-based 3D reconstruction works, which either rely on calibrated/fixed camera set up or use the observed world map to track the depth camera, our framework can simultaneously track and reconstruct small moving objects. We use both qualitative and quantitative results to demonstrate the superior performance of both tracking and reconstruction of our method.</p><p>5 0.89269078 <a title="366-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven_Efficiently-Sampled_Sparse_Graphical_Models_for_Concurrent_Tumor_Segmentation_and_Atlas_Registration.html">432 iccv-2013-Uncertainty-Driven Efficiently-Sampled Sparse Graphical Models for Concurrent Tumor Segmentation and Atlas Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Sarah Parisot, William Wells_III, Stéphane Chemouny, Hugues Duffau, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based methods have become popular in recent years and have successfully addressed tasks like segmentation and deformable registration. Their main strength is optimality of the obtained solution while their main limitation is the lack of precision due to the grid-like representations and the discrete nature of the quantized search space. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for combined segmentation/registration of brain tumors that adapts graph and sampling resolution according to the image content. To this end we estimate the segmentation and registration marginals towards adaptive graph resolution and intelligent definition of the search space. This information is considered in a hierarchical framework where uncertainties are propagated in a natural manner. State of the art results in the joint segmentation/registration of brain images with low-grade gliomas demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>6 0.88793647 <a title="366-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Measuring_Flow_Complexity_in_Videos.html">263 iccv-2013-Measuring Flow Complexity in Videos</a></p>

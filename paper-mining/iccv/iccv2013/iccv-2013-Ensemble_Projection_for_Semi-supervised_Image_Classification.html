<p>Author: Martin Köstinger, Paul Wohlhart, Peter M. Roth, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we raise important issues concerning the evaluation complexity of existing Mahalanobis metric learning methods. The complexity scales linearly with the size of the dataset. This is especially cumbersome on large scale or for real-time applications with limited time budget. To alleviate this problem we propose to represent the dataset by a fixed number of discriminative prototypes. In particular, we introduce a new method that jointly chooses the positioning of prototypes and also optimizes the Mahalanobis distance metric with respect to these. We show that choosing the positioning of the prototypes and learning the metric in parallel leads to a drastically reduced evaluation effort while maintaining the discriminative essence of the original dataset. Moreover, for most problems our method performing k-nearest prototype (k-NP) classification on the condensed dataset leads to even better generalization compared to k-NN classification using all data. Results on a variety of challenging benchmarks demonstrate the power of our method. These include standard machine learning datasets as well as the challenging Public Fig- ures Face Database. On the competitive machine learning benchmarks we are comparable to the state-of-the-art while being more efficient. On the face benchmark we clearly outperform the state-of-the-art in Mahalanobis metric learning with drastically reduced evaluation effort.</p><p>3 0.12308569 <a title="142-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Randomized_Ensemble_Tracking.html">338 iccv-2013-Randomized Ensemble Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Qinxun Bai, Zheng Wu, Stan Sclaroff, Margrit Betke, Camille Monnier</p><p>Abstract: We propose a randomized ensemble algorithm to model the time-varying appearance of an object for visual tracking. In contrast with previous online methods for updating classifier ensembles in tracking-by-detection, the weight vector that combines weak classifiers is treated as a random variable and the posterior distribution for the weight vector is estimated in a Bayesian manner. In essence, the weight vector is treated as a distribution that reflects the confidence among the weak classifiers used to construct and adapt the classifier ensemble. The resulting formulation models the time-varying discriminative ability among weak classifiers so that the ensembled strong classifier can adapt to the varying appearance, backgrounds, and occlusions. The formulation is tested in a tracking-by-detection implementation. Experiments on 28 challenging benchmark videos demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve results comparable to and often better than those of stateof-the-art approaches.</p><p>4 0.10840914 <a title="142-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_Unified_Probabilistic_Approach_Modeling_Relationships_between_Attributes_and_Objects.html">31 iccv-2013-A Unified Probabilistic Approach Modeling Relationships between Attributes and Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoyang Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a unified probabilistic model to model the relationships between attributes and objects for attribute prediction and object recognition. As a list of semantically meaningful properties of objects, attributes generally relate to each other statistically. In this paper, we propose a unified probabilistic model to automatically discover and capture both the object-dependent and objectindependent attribute relationships. The model utilizes the captured relationships to benefit both attribute prediction and object recognition. Experiments on four benchmark attribute datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed unified model for improving attribute prediction as well as object recognition in both standard and zero-shot learning cases.</p><p>5 0.10778517 <a title="142-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Adaptation_for_Personalized_Image_Search.html">52 iccv-2013-Attribute Adaptation for Personalized Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Adriana Kovashka, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: Current methods learn monolithic attribute predictors, with the assumption that a single model is sufficient to reflect human understanding of a visual attribute. However, in reality, humans vary in how they perceive the association between a named property and image content. For example, two people may have slightly different internal models for what makes a shoe look “formal”, or they may disagree on which of two scenes looks “more cluttered”. Rather than discount these differences as noise, we propose to learn user-specific attribute models. We adapt a generic model trained with annotations from multiple users, tailoring it to satisfy user-specific labels. Furthermore, we propose novel techniques to infer user-specific labels based on transitivity and contradictions in the user’s search history. We demonstrate that adapted attributes improve accuracy over both existing monolithic models as well as models that learn from scratch with user-specific data alone. In addition, we show how adapted attributes are useful to personalize image search, whether with binary or relative attributes.</p><p>6 0.096157409 <a title="142-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-NEIL%3A_Extracting_Visual_Knowledge_from_Web_Data.html">285 iccv-2013-NEIL: Extracting Visual Knowledge from Web Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Marc T. Law, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel similarity learning framework. Working with inequality constraints involving quadruplets of images, our approach aims at efficiently modeling similarity from rich or complex semantic label relationships. From these quadruplet-wise constraints, we propose a similarity learning framework relying on a convex optimization scheme. We then study how our metric learning scheme can exploit specific class relationships, such as class ranking (relative attributes), and class taxonomy. We show that classification using the learned metrics gets improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on several datasets. We also evaluate our approach in a new application to learn similarities between webpage screenshots in a fully unsupervised way.</p><p>4 0.63539213 <a title="142-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-From_Point_to_Set%3A_Extend_the_Learning_of_Distance_Metrics.html">177 iccv-2013-From Point to Set: Extend the Learning of Distance Metrics</a></p>
<p>Author: Pengfei Zhu, Lei Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Most of the current metric learning methods are proposed for point-to-point distance (PPD) based classification. In many computer vision tasks, however, we need to measure the point-to-set distance (PSD) and even set-to-set distance (SSD) for classification. In this paper, we extend the PPD based Mahalanobis distance metric learning to PSD and SSD based ones, namely point-to-set distance metric learning (PSDML) and set-to-set distance metric learning (SSDML), and solve them under a unified optimization framework. First, we generate positive and negative sample pairs by computing the PSD and SSD between training samples. Then, we characterize each sample pair by its covariance matrix, and propose a covariance kernel based discriminative function. Finally, we tackle the PSDML and SSDMLproblems by using standard support vector machine solvers, making the metric learning very efficient for multiclass visual classification tasks. Experiments on gender classification, digit recognition, object categorization and face recognition show that the proposed metric learning methods can effectively enhance the performance of PSD and SSD based classification.</p><p>5 0.5920161 <a title="142-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Semi-supervised_Robust_Dictionary_Learning_via_Efficient_l-Norms_Minimization.html">384 iccv-2013-Semi-supervised Robust Dictionary Learning via Efficient l-Norms Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Weidong Cai, Heng Huang</p><p>Abstract: Representing the raw input of a data set by a set of relevant codes is crucial to many computer vision applications. Due to the intrinsic sparse property of real-world data, dictionary learning, in which the linear decomposition of a data point uses a set of learned dictionary bases, i.e., codes, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, traditional dictionary learning methods suffer from three weaknesses: sensitivity to noisy and outlier samples, difficulty to determine the optimal dictionary size, and incapability to incorporate supervision information. In this paper, we address these weaknesses by learning a Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSR-D). Specifically, we use the ℓ2,0+ norm as the loss function to improve the robustness against outliers, and develop a new structured sparse regularization com, , tom. . cai@sydney . edu . au , heng@uta .edu make the learning tasks easier to deal with and reduce the computational cost. For example, in image tagging, instead of using the raw pixel-wise features, semi-local or patch- based features, such as SIFT and geometric blur, are usually more desirable to achieve better performance. In practice, finding a set of compact features bases, also referred to as dictionary, with enhanced representative and discriminative power, plays a significant role in building a successful computer vision system. In this paper, we explore this important problem by proposing a novel formulation and its solution for learning Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSRD), where we examine the challenges in dictionary learning, and seek opportunities to overcome them and improve the dictionary qualities. 1.1. Challenges in Dictionary Learning to incorporate the supervision information in dictionary learning, without incurring additional parameters. Moreover, the optimal dictionary size is automatically learned from the input data. Minimizing the derived objective function is challenging because it involves many non-smooth ℓ2,0+ -norm terms. We present an efficient algorithm to solve the problem with a rigorous proof of the convergence of the algorithm. Extensive experiments are presented to show the superior performance of the proposed method.</p><p>6 0.5897218 <a title="142-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Heterogeneous_Image_Features_Integration_via_Multi-modal_Semi-supervised_Learning_Model.html">194 iccv-2013-Heterogeneous Image Features Integration via Multi-modal Semi-supervised Learning Model</a></p>

Experiments on four standard datasets show three interesting phenomena: (1) our method consistently outperforms previous methods for semi-supervised image classification; (2) our method lets itself combine well with these methods; and (3) our method works well for self-taught image classification where unlabeled data are not coming from the same distribution as la- beled ones, but rather from a random collection of images.</p><p>2 0.75291455 <a title="142-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Deblurring_by_Example_Using_Dense_Correspondence.html">103 iccv-2013-Deblurring by Example Using Dense Correspondence</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoav Hacohen, Eli Shechtman, Dani Lischinski</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new method for deblurring photos using a sharp reference example that contains some shared content with the blurry photo. Most previous deblurring methods that exploit information from other photos require an accurately registered photo of the same static scene. In contrast, our method aims to exploit reference images where the shared content may have undergone substantial photometric and non-rigid geometric transformations, as these are the kind of reference images most likely to be found in personal photo albums. Our approach builds upon a recent method for examplebased deblurring using non-rigid dense correspondence (NRDC) [11] and extends it in two ways. First, we suggest exploiting information from the reference image not only for blur kernel estimation, but also as a powerful local prior for the non-blind deconvolution step. Second, we introduce a simple yet robust technique for spatially varying blur estimation, rather than assuming spatially uniform blur. Unlike the aboveprevious method, which hasproven successful only with simple deblurring scenarios, we demonstrate that our method succeeds on a variety of real-world examples. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our method and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p><p>3 0.75137311 <a title="142-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Data-Driven_3D_Primitives_for_Single_Image_Understanding.html">102 iccv-2013-Data-Driven 3D Primitives for Single Image Understanding</a></p>
<p>Author: David F. Fouhey, Abhinav Gupta, Martial Hebert</p><p>Abstract: What primitives should we use to infer the rich 3D world behind an image? We argue that these primitives should be both visually discriminative and geometrically informative and we present a technique for discovering such primitives. We demonstrate the utility of our primitives by using them to infer 3D surface normals given a single image. Our technique substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art and shows improved cross-dataset performance.</p><p>4 0.72295129 <a title="142-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Near-Optimal_Cost-Sensitive_Decision_Policy_for_Object_Detection.html">241 iccv-2013-Learning Near-Optimal Cost-Sensitive Decision Policy for Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Tianfu Wu, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Many object detectors, such as AdaBoost, SVM and deformable part-based models (DPM), compute additive scoring functions at a large number of windows scanned over image pyramid, thus computational efficiency is an important consideration beside accuracy performance. In this paper, we present a framework of learning cost-sensitive decision policy which is a sequence of two-sided thresholds to execute early rejection or early acceptance based on the accumulative scores at each step. A decision policy is said to be optimal if it minimizes an empirical global risk function that sums over the loss of false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP), and the cost of computation. While the risk function is very complex due to high-order connections among the two-sided thresholds, we find its upper bound can be optimized by dynamic programming (DP) efficiently and thus say the learned policy is near-optimal. Given the loss of FN and FP and the cost in three numbers, our method can produce a policy on-the-fly for Adaboost, SVM and DPM. In experiments, we show that our decision policy outperforms state-of-the-art cascade methods significantly in terms of speed with similar accuracy performance.</p><p>5 0.72233891 <a title="142-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Quantize_and_Conquer%3A_A_Dimensionality-Recursive_Solution_to_Clustering%2C_Vector_Quantization%2C_and_Image_Retrieval.html">333 iccv-2013-Quantize and Conquer: A Dimensionality-Recursive Solution to Clustering, Vector Quantization, and Image Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Yannis Avrithis</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by the close relation between nearest neighbor search and clustering in high-dimensional spaces as well as the success of one helping to solve the other, we introduce a new paradigm where both problems are solved simultaneously. Our solution is recursive, not in the size of input data but in the number of dimensions. One result is a clustering algorithm that is tuned to small codebooks but does not need all data in memory at the same time and is practically constant in the data size. As a by-product, a tree structure performs either exact or approximate quantization on trained centroids, the latter being not very precise but extremely fast. A lesser contribution is a new indexing scheme for image retrieval that exploits multiple small codebooks to provide an arbitrarily fine partition of the descriptor space. Large scale experiments on public datasets exhibit state of the art performance and remarkable generalization.</p><p>6 0.7174511 <a title="142-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-From_Where_and_How_to_What_We_See.html">180 iccv-2013-From Where and How to What We See</a></p>

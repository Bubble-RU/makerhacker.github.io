</p><p>5 The computation of geodesics is a central, most important, ingredient in achieving these goals. [sent-22, score-0.315]
</p><p>6 This setup is too complicated to allow analytical expressions for geodesics and one resorts to numerical techniques. [sent-24, score-0.369]
</p><p>7 Such frameworks have now been applied to different types ofobjects for shape analysis configurations of landmarks [3] and parameterized surfaces in R3 [9]. [sent-25, score-0.373]
</p><p>8 Furthermore, it focuses on a specific tool in shape analysis called the parallel transport. [sent-27, score-0.347]
</p><p>9 ) The shapes of interest are elements of this manifold, the deformations (of shapes) form tangent vectors and optimal deformations between shapes are given by geodesic paths. [sent-33, score-0.914]
</p><p>10 More formally, a geodesic is defined as a differentiable path F : [0, 1] → F such that the covariant derivative of its velocity vector is zero along the path, i. [sent-35, score-0.612]
</p><p>11 A vector field Y along any path F is said to be  constant or parallel if its covariant derivative DdtY = 0 for all t. [sent-39, score-0.639]
</p><p>12 The vector field denotes a sequence of deformations of shapes along the path F; at each shape F(t), the vector Y (t) 886655  denotes a deformation of that shape. [sent-40, score-0.761]
</p><p>13 The vector Y (t) ∈ TF(t) (F) is called the parallel translation or transport of v along F. [sent-43, score-0.843]
</p><p>14 In physical terms, it denotes the transport of the deformation v of the shape F(0) to a shape F(t). [sent-44, score-0.828]
</p><p>15 Geodesics Between Shapes Using Shooting: Given a shape f ∈ F and a deformation (tangent vector) v ∈ Tf (F), one wants to develop a tool for constructing a geodesic F : [0, 1] → F such that F(0) = f and = v, where = ddFt. [sent-50, score-0.392]
</p><p>16 The deformation v is called the shooting vector and, conversely, F is called the shooting path of f and v. [sent-51, score-1.044]
</p><p>17 One numerical approach is to start at the shape f and incrementally grow the path F by deforming the current shape with a deformation that corresponds to the initial deformation v. [sent-52, score-0.666]
</p><p>18 In order to ensure zero acceleration,  F˙  F˙(0)  the deformation at any point has to be a parallel transport of v from f to this point. [sent-53, score-0.82]
</p><p>19 ) Then, given any two shapes f1, f2 ∈ F, the next step is to find a shooting vector v ∈ Tf1(F) such that a constant speed geodesic F starting at f1, and with v as its shooting vector, reaches f2 in unit time. [sent-57, score-1.028]
</p><p>20 Geodesics Between Shapes Using Path Straightening: In this approach, one initializes an arbitrary path F : [0, 1] → F between the given shapes f1 and f2, and iteratively straightens it until it cannot be straightened any more, resulting in a geodesic between those two points. [sent-61, score-0.529]
</p><p>21 [7] provide an analytical expression for this gradient but it involves covariant integrals of F˙(t) which, in turn, requires mechanism for parallel transport of vectors. [sent-67, score-0.869]
</p><p>22 It is possible to compute geodesics using path straightening algorithm without making use of parallel transport as described in [9]. [sent-68, score-1.335]
</p><p>23 Since the deformations are represented using tangent vectors on shape spaces, and a tangent vector from one shape f1 can not be applied directly to another shape f2, it needs to be modified appropriately so it forms a valid deformation (tangent vector) at the new shape. [sent-73, score-0.982]
</p><p>24 This transfer of deformations is performed using transport of tangent vectors along geodesic paths between given shapes. [sent-74, score-1.139]
</p><p>25 Random Sampling from Statistical Shape Models: Since shape spaces are nonlinear manifolds, or their quotient spaces, statistical shape models are often defined as probability densities on the tangent spaces, especially the tangent space at the mean shape. [sent-76, score-0.781]
</p><p>26 To generate random shapes, one generates a random tangent vector according to its probability model and then maps it into a random shape using the exponential map at the mean shape. [sent-77, score-0.367]
</p><p>27 Similarly, to study modes of variations in a shape class, one computes the principal components of the corresponding tangent vectors and maps them back into the shape space. [sent-78, score-0.444]
</p><p>28 However, this forward mapping is naturally given by the exponential map and this, in turn, requires a shooting path. [sent-79, score-0.382]
</p><p>29 The shooting method, as mentioned above, requires a mechanism of parallel transport of the shooting vector along the path being constructed. [sent-80, score-1.671]
</p><p>30 This paper develops a method, starting from the first  principles, for parallel transporting vector fields along paths in the shape space of surfaces. [sent-81, score-0.599]
</p><p>31 There have been some limited papers on computation of parallel transports on shape or related spaces. [sent-82, score-0.376]
</p><p>32 However, this is not the case with our shape space of parameterized surfaces (more on that later). [sent-84, score-0.417]
</p><p>33 Some other methods, such as the Schild’s ladder [6, 10], require tools for computing geodesics as a pre-condition. [sent-85, score-0.397]
</p><p>34 The only assumption needed here is that shapes can be represented using a finite basis and since our representation space of surfaces is originally infinite, we will use a truncated basis to approximate the given surfaces and satisfy this assumption. [sent-87, score-0.767]
</p><p>35 Another prominent body of work in shape analysis relies on embeddings of shapes in larger Euclidean spaces and applies diffeomorphic transformations to these spaces to change embedded shapes [13, 4]. [sent-88, score-0.441]
</p><p>36 Recent work [1] introdued a Riemannian metric to shoot geodesics in the space of surfaces under the LDDMM framework. [sent-89, score-0.642]
</p><p>37 Although there are tools for parallel transport available there, they primarily deal with transportations of diffeomorphisms and cannot be ported to our shape space of parametric surfaces. [sent-90, score-0.936]
</p><p>38 Section 2 introduces the principles behind parallel transport and describes the SRNF representation of shapes. [sent-92, score-0.746]
</p><p>39 The formulas for parallel transport of surfaces under this representation 886666  are derived in Section 3. [sent-93, score-0.903]
</p><p>40 In order to apply the parallel transport we need a basis set and two types of basis sets are introduced in section 4. [sent-94, score-0.912]
</p><p>41 Section 5 describes the path straightening and the shooting method, for computing geodesics, both using the new transport idea. [sent-95, score-1.156]
</p><p>42 Section 6 demonstrates the parallel transport of deformations across surfaces and illustrations of random samples of shapes under statistical models. [sent-96, score-1.183]
</p><p>43 Mathematical Setup In this section we introduce parallel transport of tangent vectors in general Riemannian manifolds. [sent-99, score-0.916]
</p><p>44 Background For defining parallel transport on a Riemannian manifold M, there are two possible situations. [sent-102, score-0.744]
</p><p>45 Consequently, geodesics here are not straight lines  in R2+ and the parallel transports are not identity maps despite having Tx (R2+) = R2 at every point x. [sent-114, score-0.58]
</p><p>46 In the first case, the description of transport is relatively simple, both to define and to implement. [sent-115, score-0.508]
</p><p>47 Consider two nearby points p1 and p2 in M and we want to transport a vector v from p1 to p2. [sent-116, score-0.538]
</p><p>48 In such cases, and other situations involving abstract manifolds, one relies on the use of Riemannian connections to define covariant derivatives and parallel transports. [sent-120, score-0.335]
</p><p>49 For a path F and a vector field Y along that path, the covariant derivative of Y along F is given by DdtY = ∇ddFtY , the directional derivative of Y along the direction of the velocity vector ddFt. [sent-127, score-0.608]
</p><p>50 w, in order to transport a vector v ∈ TF(0) (M) along path F, we need to find constant vector field Y along F(t), i. [sent-144, score-0.859]
</p><p>51 Then, the vector Y (t) ∈ TF(t) (M) is called the parallel translation of v along F. [sent-148, score-0.335]
</p><p>52 Thus computations of shooting paths and parallel transports of vectors is not a trivial task and requires special procedures. [sent-193, score-0.689]
</p><p>53 We will initially develop the desired transport tools for the pre-shape space F and later extend them to the shape space S. [sent-205, score-0.738]
</p><p>54 Say, we want to parallel transport a deformation v ∈ TF(0) (F) along a path F(t). [sent-207, score-1.039]
</p><p>55 transport incrementally from time t to t + δ using, for each k,  ak(t + δ) = ak(t) − δ? [sent-225, score-0.531]
</p><p>56 To summarize the main result of this section, we have truncated the basis representation of surface space F to a finite set, and expressed the Riemannian metric tensor and its inverse as N N matrices with respect to that truncated basis. [sent-267, score-0.412]
</p><p>57 These matrices are then used to calculate Christoffel symbols that directly parameterize the difference equation for propagating a tangent vector incrementally according  −1  to Eqn. [sent-268, score-0.317]
</p><p>58 This discretized propagation of tangent vectors along a path results in their parallel transport. [sent-270, score-0.627]
</p><p>59 Now we have a complete numerical recipe for computing parallel transport of shape deformations represented by tangent vectors. [sent-271, score-1.188]
</p><p>60 It is also possible to use different bases for the surfaces (elements of F) and the deformations (elements of tangent spaces Tf (F)) to improve efficiency, although we will use the same basis set for both the spaces in this paper. [sent-276, score-0.703]
</p><p>61 Then, a basis for representing surfaces f : S2 → R3 can be constructed as {Yie1 }∪{Yje2}∪{Yke3}, where {e1, e2 , e3} is the standard basis for R3. [sent-281, score-0.371]
</p><p>62 Another choice of basis that is useful when some training shapes are available for the shape class of interest can be obtained using principal component analysis. [sent-284, score-0.349]
</p><p>63 Geodesics In Shape Space In the next few sections we will illustrate the use of parallel transport algorithm (implementation of Eqn. [sent-288, score-0.722]
</p><p>64 Although we want geodesics in the shape space S = F/(SO(3) Γ), so far we have considered only the preshape space F. [sent-292, score-0.514]
</p><p>65 To extend the parallel transport to shape  space will be automatic once the given two surfaces are optimally registered. [sent-293, score-1.058]
</p><p>66 Compute the parallel transport v(τn−1) to F( nτ ) and name it v( τn). [sent-304, score-0.722]
</p><p>67 First row uses the shooting method and the second row uses the straightening method. [sent-308, score-0.476]
</p><p>68 The green curves are initial geodesics, blue are final geodesics and red are exact geodesics obtained from analytical expressions. [sent-309, score-0.681]
</p><p>69 ze the shooting direction as v0 and update it in an iterative manner as follows. [sent-322, score-0.35]
</p><p>70 Shoot a geodesic F(m) (t) = expf1 (tv(m) ) for the current shooting direction as described above. [sent-325, score-0.533]
</p><p>71 Compute w = f2∗ F(m) (1) and parallel transport w from t = 1to t = 0 along F(m) . [sent-327, score-0.769]
</p><p>72 converges, stop; otherwise, update the shooting direction v(m+1) = v(m) + δw||. [sent-333, score-0.35]
</p><p>73 Path Straightening The second algorithm for computing geodesics is path straightening. [sent-342, score-0.487]
</p><p>74 For a path on shape space of surfaces F : [0, 1] → S, the energy function is given by E(F) = ? [sent-345, score-0.508]
</p><p>75 Both these steps covariant integral and parallel translation of u(1) require tools for parallel transport developed earlier. [sent-373, score-1.11]
</p><p>76 To compare results obtained using the two geodesic methods, Figure 3 shows their results of computing geodesics connecting the same pair of surfaces. [sent-378, score-0.498]
</p><p>77 The two top rows display the results from path straightening: the first row shows the initial path and the second row displays the final geodesic path. [sent-379, score-0.575]
</p><p>78 The two bottom rows are results from the shooting method: the first row shows the initial path with the starting surface f1in an initial shooting direction v(0) , such that F(0)(t) = expf1(tv(0)), and the second row shows the final shooting geodesic path. [sent-381, score-1.516]

</p><p>87 Thus, we need to transport v1 to f2 and to perform this transport we first compute a geodesic F connecting f1 to f2 in S. [sent-441, score-1.199]
</p><p>88 Then, we parallel  transport v1 from f1to f2 along F to obtain a valid deformation of f2 as v2 = and apply it to f2. [sent-442, score-0.867]
</p><p>89 To illustrate the utility of this framework, we further define the deformation v1 as one that takes f1to a third surface f3 (via a geodesic path). [sent-443, score-0.342]
</p><p>90 To visualize the effect of the transported v1 on f2, we shoot a geodesic from f2 in that direction and show the resulting shape f4 = expf2 (v2). [sent-445, score-0.372]

<p>Author: Susanna Ricco, Carlo Tomasi</p><p>Abstract: Dense motion of image points over many video frames can provide important information about the world. However, occlusions and drift make it impossible to compute long motionpaths by merely concatenating opticalflow vectors between consecutive frames. Instead, we solve for entire paths directly, and flag the frames in which each is visible. As in previous work, we anchor each path to a unique pixel which guarantees an even spatial distribution of paths. Unlike earlier methods, we allow paths to be anchored in any frame. By explicitly requiring that at least one visible path passes within a small neighborhood of every pixel, we guarantee complete coverage of all visible points in all frames. We achieve state-of-the-art results on real sequences including both rigid and non-rigid motions with significant occlusions.</p><p>3 0.12891091 <a title="307-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Generic_Deformation_Model_for_Dense_Non-rigid_Surface_Registration%3A_A_Higher-Order_MRF-Based_Approach.html">16 iccv-2013-A Generic Deformation Model for Dense Non-rigid Surface Registration: A Higher-Order MRF-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Xianfeng Gu, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dense non-rigid 3D surface registration, which brings together Riemannian geometry and graphical models. To this end, we first introduce a generic deformation model, called Canonical Distortion Coefficients (CDCs), by characterizing the deformation of every point on a surface using the distortions along its two principle directions. This model subsumes the deformation groups commonly used in surface registration such as isometry and conformality, and is able to handle more complex deformations. We also derive its discrete counterpart which can be computed very efficiently in a closed form. Based on these, we introduce a higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) model which seamlessly integrates our deformation model and a geometry/texture similarity metric. Then we jointly establish the optimal correspondences for all the points via maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference.

<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for 2D shape analysis using positive definite kernels defined on Kendall’s shape manifold. Different representations of 2D shapes are known to generate different nonlinear spaces. Due to the nonlinearity of these spaces, most existing shape classification algorithms resort to nearest neighbor methods and to learning distances on shape spaces. Here, we propose to map shapes on Kendall’s shape manifold to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To this end, we introduce a kernel on this manifold that permits such a mapping, and prove its positive definiteness. This kernel lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM, MKL and kernel PCA, to the shape manifold. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods on shape classification, clustering and retrieval.</p><p>5 0.10599846 <a title="307-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Total_Variation_Regularization_for_Functions_with_Values_in_a_Manifold.html">421 iccv-2013-Total Variation Regularization for Functions with Values in a Manifold</a></p>

In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to solve such problems which applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. The key idea is to reformulate the variational problem as a multilabel optimization problem with an infinite number of labels. This leads to a hard optimization problem which can be approximately solved using convex relaxation techniques. The framework can be easily adapted to different manifolds including spheres and three-dimensional rotations, and allows to obtain accurate solutions even with a relatively coarse discretization. With numerous examples we demonstrate that the proposed framework can be applied to variational models that incorporate chromaticity values, normal fields, or camera trajectories.</p><p>6 0.097068585 <a title="307-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Support_Surface_Prediction_in_Indoor_Scenes.html">410 iccv-2013-Support Surface Prediction in Indoor Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Qian Xie, Sebastian Kurtek, Huiling Le, Anuj Srivastava</p><p>Abstract: Statistical shape analysis develops methods for comparisons, deformations, summarizations, and modeling of shapes in given data sets. These tasks require afundamental tool called parallel transport of tangent vectors along arbitrary paths. This tool is essential for: (1) computation of geodesic paths using either shooting or path-straightening method, (2) transferring deformations across objects, and (3) modeling of statistical variability in shapes. Using the square-root normal field (SRNF) representation of parameterized surfaces, we present a method for transporting deformations along paths in the shape space. This is difficult despite the underlying space being a vector space because the chosen (elastic) Riemannian metric is non-standard. Using a finite-basis for representing SRNFs of shapes, we derive expressions for Christoffel symbols that enable parallel transports. We demonstrate this framework using examples from shape analysis of parameterized spherical sur- faces, in the three contexts mentioned above.</p><p>2 0.60122198 <a title="307-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Motion_for_Every_Visible_Point.html">441 iccv-2013-Video Motion for Every Visible Point</a></p>
<p>Author: Susanna Ricco, Carlo Tomasi</p><p>Abstract: Dense motion of image points over many video frames can provide important information about the world. However, occlusions and drift make it impossible to compute long motionpaths by merely concatenating opticalflow vectors between consecutive frames. Instead, we solve for entire paths directly, and flag the frames in which each is visible. As in previous work, we anchor each path to a unique pixel which guarantees an even spatial distribution of paths. Unlike earlier methods, we allow paths to be anchored in any frame. By explicitly requiring that at least one visible path passes within a small neighborhood of every pixel, we guarantee complete coverage of all visible points in all frames. We achieve state-of-the-art results on real sequences including both rigid and non-rigid motions with significant occlusions.</p><p>3 0.59585285 <a title="307-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Generic_Deformation_Model_for_Dense_Non-rigid_Surface_Registration%3A_A_Higher-Order_MRF-Based_Approach.html">16 iccv-2013-A Generic Deformation Model for Dense Non-rigid Surface Registration: A Higher-Order MRF-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Xianfeng Gu, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dense non-rigid 3D surface registration, which brings together Riemannian geometry and graphical models. To this end, we first introduce a generic deformation model, called Canonical Distortion Coefficients (CDCs), by characterizing the deformation of every point on a surface using the distortions along its two principle directions. This model subsumes the deformation groups commonly used in surface registration such as isometry and conformality, and is able to handle more complex deformations. We also derive its discrete counterpart which can be computed very efficiently in a closed form. Based on these, we introduce a higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) model which seamlessly integrates our deformation model and a geometry/texture similarity metric. Then we jointly establish the optimal correspondences for all the points via maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Moreover, we develop a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently perform the inference for the proposed higher-order MRF model. The resulting registration algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both dense non-rigid 3D surface registration and tracking.</p><p>4 0.55637759 <a title="307-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Geometric_Registration_Based_on_Distortion_Estimation.html">183 iccv-2013-Geometric Registration Based on Distortion Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Zeng, Mayank Goswami, Feng Luo, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Surface registration plays a fundamental role in many applications in computer vision and aims at finding a oneto-one correspondence between surfaces. Conformal mapping based surface registration methods conformally map 2D/3D surfaces onto 2D canonical domains and perform the matching on the 2D plane. This registration framework reduces dimensionality, and the result is intrinsic to Riemannian metric and invariant under isometric deformation. However, conformal mapping will be affected by inconsistent boundaries and non-isometric deformations of surfaces. In this work, we quantify the effects of boundary variation and non-isometric deformation to conformal mappings, and give the theoretical upper bounds for the distortions of conformal mappings under these two factors. Besides giving the thorough theoretical proofs of the theorems, we verified them by concrete experiments using 3D human facial scans with dynamic expressions and varying boundaries. Furthermore, we used the distortion estimates for reducing search range in feature matching of surface registration applications. The experimental results are consistent with the theoreticalpredictions and also demonstrate the performance improvements in feature tracking.</p><p>5 0.52466422 <a title="307-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Total_Variation_Regularization_for_Functions_with_Values_in_a_Manifold.html">421 iccv-2013-Total Variation Regularization for Functions with Values in a Manifold</a></p>

<p>Author: Qifeng Chen, Vladlen Koltun</p><p>Abstract: We present a model for intrinsic decomposition of RGB-D images. Our approach analyzes a single RGB-D image and estimates albedo and shading fields that explain the input. To disambiguate the problem, our model estimates a number of components that jointly account for the reconstructed shading. By decomposing the shading field, we can build in assumptions about image formation that help distinguish reflectance variation from shading. These assumptions are expressed as simple nonlocal regularizers. We evaluate the model on real-world images and on a challenging synthetic dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms prior models for intrinsic decomposition of RGB-D images.</p><p>4 0.70467615 <a title="307-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Segmentation_with_Cascaded_Hierarchical_Models_and_Logistic_Disjunctive_Normal_Networks.html">211 iccv-2013-Image Segmentation with Cascaded Hierarchical Models and Logistic Disjunctive Normal Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Mojtaba Seyedhosseini, Mehdi Sajjadi, Tolga Tasdizen</p><p>Abstract: Contextual information plays an important role in solving vision problems such as image segmentation. However, extracting contextual information and using it in an effective way remains a difficult problem. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-resolution contextual framework, called cascaded hierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical framework for image segmentation. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is trained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our model then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information into a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. We repeat this procedure by cascading the hierarchical framework to improve the segmentation accuracy. Multiple classifiers are learned in the CHM; therefore, a fast and accurate classifier is required to make the training tractable. The classifier also needs to be robust against overfitting due to the large number of parameters learned during training. We introduce a novel classification scheme, called logistic dis- junctive normal networks (LDNN), which consists of one adaptive layer of feature detectors implemented by logistic sigmoid functions followed by two fixed layers of logical units that compute conjunctions and disjunctions, respectively. We demonstrate that LDNN outperforms state-of-theart classifiers and can be used in the CHM to improve object segmentation performance.</p><p>5 0.70192432 <a title="307-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_CRFs_for_Image_Parsing_with_Adaptive_Subgradient_Descent.html">234 iccv-2013-Learning CRFs for Image Parsing with Adaptive Subgradient Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Honghui Zhang, Jingdong Wang, Ping Tan, Jinglu Wang, Long Quan</p><p>Abstract: We propose an adaptive subgradient descent method to efficiently learn the parameters of CRF models for image parsing. To balance the learning efficiency and performance of the learned CRF models, the parameter learning is iteratively carried out by solving a convex optimization problem in each iteration, which integrates a proximal term to preserve the previously learned information and the large margin preference to distinguish bad labeling and the ground truth labeling. A solution of subgradient descent updating form is derived for the convex optimization problem, with an adaptively determined updating step-size. Besides, to deal with partially labeled training data, we propose a new objective constraint modeling both the labeled and unlabeled parts in the partially labeled training data for the parameter learning of CRF models. The superior learning efficiency of the proposed method is verified by the experiment results on two public datasets. We also demonstrate the powerfulness of our method for handling partially labeled training data.</p><p>6 0.63761055 <a title="307-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Symbiotic_Segmentation_and_Part_Localization_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization.html">411 iccv-2013-Symbiotic Segmentation and Part Localization for Fine-Grained Categorization</a></p>

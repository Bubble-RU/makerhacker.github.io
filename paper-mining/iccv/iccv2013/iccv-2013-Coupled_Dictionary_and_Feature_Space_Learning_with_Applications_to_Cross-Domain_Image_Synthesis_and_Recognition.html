</p><p>6 Introduction  Many computer vision problems can be approached as solving the task of associating data or knowledge across different domains. [sent-9, score-0.166]
</p><p>7 On the other hand, crossview action recognition utilizes training data captured by one camera, and thus the designed features or classifiers can be applied to recognize test data at a different view [4]. [sent-11, score-0.401]
</p><p>8 , cross-view action recognition) problems, how to represent and relate data across different domains become a major challenge [20, 25, 10, 16, 12]. [sent-16, score-0.271]
</p><p>9 Note that D, A, U, and P are the dictionaries, coefficients, projection matrices, and projected data observed at the associated image domain (i. [sent-50, score-0.222]
</p><p>10 recognition tasks, domain adaptation [1] particularly favors the scenarios in which labeled data can be obtained at the source domain, but only little or no labeled target domain data is available. [sent-53, score-0.371]
</p><p>11 As a result, unlabeled data from both domains will be utilized for relating the knowledge across different domains. [sent-54, score-0.254]
</p><p>12 Generally, approaches like [12, 16, 18, 10] focus on determining a common feature space or representation using cross-domain unlabeled data pairs, so that classifiers trained in this feature space can be applied to recognize the projected test data. [sent-55, score-0.43]
</p><p>13 [12] proposed a bag-of-bilingual-words (BoBW) model as a shared  feature representation, which is used to describe the same action data captured by different cameras. [sent-59, score-0.211]
</p><p>14 , data correlation), they cannot be easily extended to image synthesis problems due to the lack of data representation or reconstruction guarantees. [sent-63, score-0.322]
</p><p>15 Among existing approaches, coupled dictionary learning assumes that some relationships between raw and desirable image data exist and aims at learning a pair of dictionaries for describing cross-domain image data. [sent-65, score-0.544]
</p><p>16 As a result, information extracted from the input domain can be applied to synthesize images at the output domain accordingly. [sent-66, score-0.154]
</p><p>17 [25] assumed that LR image patches have the same sparse representations as their HR versions do, and proposed a joint dictionary learning model for SR using concatenated HR/LR image features. [sent-68, score-0.3]
</p><p>18 They later imposed relaxed constraints on the observed dictionary/coefficient pairs across image domains for improved performance [24]. [sent-69, score-0.12]
</p><p>19 [19] further proposed a semi-coupled dictionary learning (SCDL) scheme by advancing a linear mapping for cross-domain image sparse representation. [sent-71, score-0.3]
</p><p>20 In addition to the aforementioned assumptions on image priors, most prior image synthesis algorithms focused on data representation/reconsturction when designing or optimizing their proposed formulation. [sent-73, score-0.284]
</p><p>21 , face recognition after hallucination), it would be preferable to integrate image synthesis and recognition algorithms into a unified framework instead of solving them separately. [sent-76, score-0.499]
</p><p>22 Another potential yet practical issue of the most prior synthesis approaches is that, their need to collect cross-domain training image data beforehand might not be applicable for real-world applications like single image SR or denoising. [sent-77, score-0.347]
</p><p>23 It is worth noting that, sparse representation has been widely applied to various image synthesis and recognition tasks [3, 25, 22]. [sent-78, score-0.439]
</p><p>24 Besides the aforementioned work ofimage SR [25], Elad and Aharon [3] proposed to utilize an overcomplete dictionary observed from an input noisy image, and thus the associated noise patterns can be removed from the reconstructed image for denoising purposes. [sent-79, score-0.225]
</p><p>25 [26] addressed both face restoration and recognition problems by jointly estimating the blurring kernel and sparse representation. [sent-83, score-0.177]
</p><p>26 As noted in [16, 12], however, the use of a single linear operator for relating face images and their degraded versions might not be preferable for general image  recognition problems. [sent-84, score-0.197]
</p><p>27 Our Contributions The main contribution of this paper is to present a joint model which learns a pair of dictionaries with a feature space for describing and associating cross-domain data. [sent-88, score-0.26]
</p><p>28 Therefore, our model is able to address both cross-domain synthesis and recognition problems, while most existing works (e. [sent-90, score-0.311]
</p><p>29 As confirmed later by our experiments, our proposed model can be applied to a variety of cross-domain image synthesis and recognition tasks such as single image super-resolution, cross-camera action recognition, and sketch-to-photo face recognition. [sent-93, score-0.542]
</p><p>30 1, we present the problem formulation and explain how we represent and associate cross-domain im-  ××  age data by jointly solving coupled dictionary and common feature space learning problems. [sent-96, score-0.536]
</p><p>31 Coupled dictionary learning can be approached as solving the following minimization problem:  ×n  Dx,Dmy,iAnx,AyEDL(X,+DExC,oAupxl)ed +(D EDx,LD(Yy, ADxy, AAyy) . [sent-108, score-0.308]
</p><p>32 (1)  In (1), EDL denotes the energy term for dictionary learning and is typically in terms of data reconstruction error. [sent-109, score-0.278]
</p><p>33 The coupled energy term ECoupled regularizes the relationship between the observed dictionaries Dx ∈ Rdx k1 and Dy ∈ Rdy k2 , or that between the resulting c Roefficients Ax ∈∈ Rk1 and Ay ∈ Rk2 Note that k1 and k2 are th∈e numbers of dictionary atoms for Dx and Dy, respectively. [sent-110, score-0.448]
</p><p>34 In our work, we consider the formulation of sparse representation for EDL, since it has been shown to be very effective in many image synthesis or recognition tasks. [sent-111, score-0.371]
</p><p>35 For the coupled energy term, we do not explicitly relate the dictionaries Dx and Dy. [sent-112, score-0.273]
</p><p>36 Instead, we impose association functions relating the resulting coefficients Ax and Ay. [sent-113, score-0.145]
</p><p>37 A recent SR work in [25] assumed that LR image patches have the same sparse representations as their HR versions do, and proposed a joint dictionary learning model for representing LR and HR image pairs. [sent-132, score-0.3]
</p><p>38 [19] presented a semi-coupled dictionary learning (SCDL) model and considered F(Ax , Ay) = ? [sent-136, score-0.24]
</p><p>39 om one domain to be identical to those observed at the other domain via a linear projection W. [sent-139, score-0.216]
</p><p>40 In order to better describe and associate cross-domain data, we incorporate common feature space learning into the original coupled dictionary learning scheme. [sent-140, score-0.501]
</p><p>41 2F A,x w,h aenrde UPxx =∈  UxAx ∈ Rkc is the projected data of X in the kcdimensio∈nal R common feature space. [sent-148, score-0.161]
</p><p>42 It can be seen that we transform the common feature space learning problem into the learning of projection matrices Ux and Uy, which will be utilized to relate cross-domain data in the derived feature space. [sent-150, score-0.496]
</p><p>43 Different from prior joint or semi-coupled dictionary learning works, this further relaxes assumptions on the observed dictionaries or sparse coefficients. [sent-151, score-0.449]
</p><p>44 UxAx − UyAy as the association function when solving the coupled dictionary learning problem. [sent-155, score-0.417]
</p><p>45 In our work, we not only require the common feature space to relate cross-domain data, we also need this space to exhibit additional capabilities in recovering images in one domain using data projected from the other. [sent-165, score-0.364]
</p><p>46 To be more precise, for an arbitrary instance p in the common feature space which is projected from the image set X (or Y), we can derive αy = Uy−1p (or αx = Ux−1p) so that the output image in the other domain can be reconstructed by calculating Dyαy (or Dxαx). [sent-166, score-0.238]
</p><p>47 In our work, we have k1 = k2 = kc since Ux and Uy need to satisfy the above function for cross-domain synthesis guarantees. [sent-198, score-0.246]
</p><p>48 We would like to point out that, thejoint dictionary learn-  ing approach in [25] and SCDL in [19] can be viewed as special cases of our proposed model by having Ux = Uy = I [25] or Ux = I Uy = W for [19]. [sent-237, score-0.197]
</p><p>49 This explains why our model can be applied for solving both synthesis and recognition problems. [sent-239, score-0.351]
</p><p>50 In the next subsection, we will detail the optimization process at the training stage for deriving the dictionary pair, sparse coefficients, and the projection matrices. [sent-240, score-0.374]
</p><p>51 Given training image data X and Y, we apply an iterative algorithm (as shown in Algorithm 1) to optimize the dictionaries D, coefficients A, and projection matrices U, respectively. [sent-244, score-0.318]
</p><p>52 1  Updating Dx and Dy  We first apply the approach of joint dictionary learning [25] to calculate Dx and Dy for the initialization of the optimization process. [sent-248, score-0.271]
</p><p>53 When updating the two dictionaries during each iteration, we consider the sparse coefficients A and projection matrices U as constants. [sent-249, score-0.359]
</p><p>54 2  Updating Ax and Ay  Similar to dictionary updates, the projection matrices U and dictionaries D are fixed when we calculate the solutions of sparse coefficients Ax and Ay. [sent-270, score-0.54]
</p><p>55 Besides the standard sparse coding formulation, we have additional terms associated with common feature space learning when updating A. [sent-271, score-0.266]
</p><p>56 Cross-Domain Image Synthesis & Recognition We now discuss how we apply the proposed model for solving image synthesis and recognition problems. [sent-332, score-0.351]
</p><p>57 In particular, examples of single image SR and cross-view action recognition will be presented. [sent-333, score-0.197]
</p><p>58 Cross-domain image synthesis To address cross-domain image synthesis problems, we first collect cross-domain image/patch pairs for training purposes. [sent-336, score-0.596]
</p><p>59 This is achieved by calculating the sparse coefficients Aˆx of Xˆ via solving  mAˆxin? [sent-338, score-0.161]

</p><p>61 Use C to predict the labels L of Py Output: C and L  Once Aˆx is produced, we associate it to Aˆy by (3) in the derived common feature space: Aˆy  ≈  Uy−1Pˆx = Uy−1UxAˆx. [sent-363, score-0.142]
</p><p>62 Cross-domain image recognition To recognize images at the target domain using labeled source-domain data, we first collect unlabeled data pairs from both domains for learning the models D, A, and U. [sent-368, score-0.509]
</p><p>63 Next, we apply the observed Dx and Dy to calculate the sparse coefficients Ax and Ay for the labeled source-  domain data X and target-domain test data Y. [sent-369, score-0.371]
</p><p>64 The matrices Ux and Uy then project these coefficients into the common feature space by Px = UxAx and Py = UyAy. [sent-370, score-0.213]
</p><p>65 Finally, classifiers can be designed using Px in this feature space, and recognition of Py can be performed accordingly. [sent-371, score-0.137]
</p><p>66 As noted in Section 1 and [11], cross-domain recognition approaches based on common feature space learning do not necessarily take class label information into their problem formulations (e. [sent-373, score-0.224]
</p><p>67 This is because that, the goal of correspondence-mode approaches like [4, 12] and ours is to derive a common feature space using only unlabeled cross-domain data pairs. [sent-376, score-0.239]
</p><p>68 Once this space is observed, one can project source-domain training (labeled) data and target-domain test data into the derived space, and apply standard classifiers like SVM for recognition. [sent-377, score-0.237]
</p><p>69 2 Cross-view action recognition For cross-view action recognition, one needs to recognize test data captured at one camera using labeled training data at a different view. [sent-410, score-0.507]
</p><p>70 Recent works like [4, 12, 11] advanced domain adaptation techniques and utilized unlabeled data pairs (pre-collected from both camera views) for deriving a common feature space. [sent-411, score-0.405]
</p><p>71 r51i4a782l  We consider the same setting above and use unlabeled data pairs (e. [sent-422, score-0.164]
</p><p>72 , action data not of interest) collected by both cameras for learning our model. [sent-424, score-0.213]
</p><p>73 Once the training is complete, we take labeled source-view data as X and targetview test data as Y, and we calculate their coefficients Ax and Ay. [sent-425, score-0.234]
</p><p>74 Finally, we train classifiers using projected labeled data Px = UxAx in the derived feature space, and perform recognition of Py = UyAy in the same space. [sent-426, score-0.322]
</p><p>75 1 pixels,  and the numbers of dictionary atoimn sF ifgourr beo 2th is D 5×x 5a pndix Dy are k1 = k2 = 512. [sent-441, score-0.197]
</p><p>76 It is worth repeating that, ScSR and SCDL were particularly designed to address image SR, while our model can be applied to both cross-domain synthesis and recognition problems. [sent-453, score-0.35]
</p><p>77 Cross-View Action Recognition  We first address cross-view action recognition as one of the cross-domain image recognition tasks. [sent-468, score-0.262]
</p><p>78 We consider the IXMAS multiview action dataset [21] which contains video frames of eleven action classes. [sent-469, score-0.264]
</p><p>79 In this dataset, each action video is performed three times by twelve people, and videos of the same action are synchronically captured by five cameras (i. [sent-470, score-0.264]
</p><p>80 Example action videos at different camera views are shown in Figure 6. [sent-473, score-0.132]
</p><p>81 In our experiments, we choose the same bag-of-features (BOF) model to describe action data as [12] did (the BOF models are calculated from spatial-temporal cuboids extracted from each video at each view using 1000 visual words). [sent-474, score-0.17]
</p><p>82 Following the same leave-one-action-out strategy as in [12], we take one action class to be recognized, and thus all videos of that action are excluded from the selection of the unlabeled data set. [sent-475, score-0.387]
</p><p>83 Besides CCA which determines a correlation subspace for cross-domain data, we consider two recent approaches of [4, 12] which also focus on deriving common feature spaces for cross-domain recognition. [sent-479, score-0.133]
</p><p>84 For all methods considered, nonlinear SVMs with Gaussian kernels [2] are trained at the derived feature space using labeled data projected from the source view, and recognition is performed on test data projected from the target view. [sent-481, score-0.412]
</p><p>85 It is worth repeating that, we consider the setting where only unlabeled cross-domain data pairs are available for learning the domain adaptation model (as [4, 12, 16] did). [sent-483, score-0.323]
</p><p>86 We randomly select 88 sketch-photo pairs as unlabeled data for training our proposed model, and the remaining 100 image pairs are used for evaluating the recognition performance. [sent-493, score-0.298]
</p><p>87 Each row represents an action at five different camera views. [sent-529, score-0.132]
</p><p>88 the 100 image pairs are viewed as source domain data and will be projected onto the derived feature space. [sent-530, score-0.306]
</p><p>89 The corresponding sketches will be treated as test data at the target domain for recognition. [sent-531, score-0.145]
</p><p>90 Once the test images are also pro-  jected onto the same feature space, recognition is performed by nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers (as the same classification strategy as [16] did). [sent-532, score-0.137]
</p><p>91 Besides considering CCA as the baseline approach, we consider the methods of Tang & Wang [17], PLS [16], bilinear model [18], SCDL [19], and joint dictionary learning  Figure 7. [sent-537, score-0.272]
</p><p>92 For SCDL, joint dictionary learning, and our model, we set the numbers of atoms to be learned k1 = k2 = 50 for the dictionary pair the same at both image domains. [sent-540, score-0.394]
</p><p>93 For joint dictionary learning and SCDL, we take the calculated sparse representations as features for performing recognition. [sent-542, score-0.3]
</p><p>94 It is worth noting that, since the approaches of SCDL and joint dictionary learning were not designed for cross-domain recognition (and did not explicitly derive a common feature space for associating  cross-domain data), they are not expected to achieve comparable results as ours does.

</p><p>96 In our work, the derived feature space not only associates cross-domain data for performing recognition, it also updates the dictionaries in each data domain for improved image representation. [sent-574, score-0.417]
</p><p>97 As a result, the proposed model can be applied to both cross-domain synthesis and recognition problems. [sent-575, score-0.311]

<p>Author: Chih-Yuan Yang, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: The goal of single-image super-resolution is to generate a high-quality high-resolution image based on a given low-resolution input. It is an ill-posed problem which requires exemplars or priors to better reconstruct the missing high-resolution image details. In this paper, we propose to split the feature space into numerous subspaces and collect exemplars to learn priors for each subspace, thereby creating effective mapping functions.

<p>Author: Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Weidong Cai, Heng Huang</p><p>Abstract: Representing the raw input of a data set by a set of relevant codes is crucial to many computer vision applications. Due to the intrinsic sparse property of real-world data, dictionary learning, in which the linear decomposition of a data point uses a set of learned dictionary bases, i.e., codes, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, traditional dictionary learning methods suffer from three weaknesses: sensitivity to noisy and outlier samples, difficulty to determine the optimal dictionary size, and incapability to incorporate supervision information. In this paper, we address these weaknesses by learning a Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSR-D). Specifically, we use the ℓ2,0+ norm as the loss function to improve the robustness against outliers, and develop a new structured sparse regularization com, , tom. . cai@sydney . edu . au , heng@uta .edu make the learning tasks easier to deal with and reduce the computational cost. For example, in image tagging, instead of using the raw pixel-wise features, semi-local or patch- based features, such as SIFT and geometric blur, are usually more desirable to achieve better performance. In practice, finding a set of compact features bases, also referred to as dictionary, with enhanced representative and discriminative power, plays a significant role in building a successful computer vision system. In this paper, we explore this important problem by proposing a novel formulation and its solution for learning Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSRD), where we examine the challenges in dictionary learning, and seek opportunities to overcome them and improve the dictionary qualities. 1.1. Challenges in Dictionary Learning to incorporate the supervision information in dictionary learning, without incurring additional parameters. Moreover, the optimal dictionary size is automatically learned from the input data. Minimizing the derived objective function is challenging because it involves many non-smooth ℓ2,0+ -norm terms. We present an efficient algorithm to solve the problem with a rigorous proof of the convergence of the algorithm. Extensive experiments are presented to show the superior performance of the proposed method.</p><p>4 0.20928502 <a title="96-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Sparsity-Based_Orthogonal_Dictionary_Learning_for_Image_Restoration.html">161 iccv-2013-Fast Sparsity-Based Orthogonal Dictionary Learning for Image Restoration</a></p>
<p>Author: Chenglong Bao, Jian-Feng Cai, Hui Ji</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, how to learn a dictionary from input images for sparse modelling has been one very active topic in image processing and recognition. Most existing dictionary learning methods consider an over-complete dictionary, e.g. the K-SVD method. Often they require solving some minimization problem that is very challenging in terms of computational feasibility and efficiency. However, if the correlations among dictionary atoms are not well constrained, the redundancy of the dictionary does not necessarily improve the performance of sparse coding. This paper proposed a fast orthogonal dictionary learning method for sparse image representation. With comparable performance on several image restoration tasks, the proposed method is much more computationally efficient than the over-complete dictionary based learning methods.</p><p>5 0.20865689 <a title="96-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_View-Invariant_Sparse_Representations_for_Cross-View_Action_Recognition.html">244 iccv-2013-Learning View-Invariant Sparse Representations for Cross-View Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Jingjing Zheng, Zhuolin Jiang</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to jointly learn a set of viewspecific dictionaries and a common dictionary for crossview action recognition. The set of view-specific dictionaries is learned for specific views while the common dictionary is shared across different views. Our approach represents videos in each view using both the corresponding view-specific dictionary and the common dictionary. More importantly, it encourages the set of videos taken from different views of the same action to have similar sparse representations. In this way, we can align view-specific features in the sparse feature spaces spanned by the viewspecific dictionary set and transfer the view-shared features in the sparse feature space spanned by the common dictionary. Meanwhile, the incoherence between the common dictionary and the view-specific dictionary set enables us to exploit the discrimination information encoded in viewspecific features and view-shared features separately. In addition, the learned common dictionary not only has the capability to represent actions from unseen views, but also , makes our approach effective in a semi-supervised setting where no correspondence videos exist and only a few labels exist in the target view. Extensive experiments using the multi-view IXMAS dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms many recent approaches for cross-view action recognition.</p><p>6 0.20619917 <a title="96-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Example-Based_Super-Resolution.html">51 iccv-2013-Anchored Neighborhood Regression for Fast Example-Based Super-Resolution</a></p>

<p>Author: De-An Huang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p><p>Abstract: Cross-domain image synthesis and recognition are typically considered as two distinct tasks in the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition. Therefore, it is not clear whether approaches addressing one task can be easily generalized or extended for solving the other. In this paper, we propose a unified model for coupled dictionary and feature space learning. The proposed learning model not only observes a common feature space for associating cross-domain image data for recognition purposes, the derived feature space is able to jointly update the dictionaries in each image domain for improved representation. This is why our method can be applied to both cross-domain image synthesis and recognition problems. Experiments on a variety of synthesis and recognition tasks such as single image super-resolution, cross-view action recognition, and sketchto-photo face recognition would verify the effectiveness of our proposed learning model.</p><p>2 0.8155328 <a title="96-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Example-Based_Super-Resolution.html">51 iccv-2013-Anchored Neighborhood Regression for Fast Example-Based Super-Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Radu Timofte, Vincent De_Smet, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Recently there have been significant advances in image upscaling or image super-resolution based on a dictionary of low and high resolution exemplars. The running time of the methods is often ignored despite the fact that it is a critical factor for real applications. This paper proposes fast super-resolution methods while making no compromise on quality. First, we support the use of sparse learned dictionaries in combination with neighbor embedding methods. In this case, the nearest neighbors are computed using the correlation with the dictionary atoms rather than the Euclidean distance. Moreover, we show that most of the current approaches reach top performance for the right parameters. Second, we show that using global collaborative coding has considerable speed advantages, reducing the super-resolution mapping to a precomputed projective matrix. Third, we propose the anchored neighborhood regression. That is to anchor the neighborhood embedding of a low resolution patch to the nearest atom in the dictionary and to precompute the corresponding embedding matrix. These proposals are contrasted with current state-of- the-art methods on standard images. We obtain similar or improved quality and one or two orders of magnitude speed improvements.</p><p>3 0.73335969 <a title="96-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Direct_Super-Resolution_by_Simple_Functions.html">156 iccv-2013-Fast Direct Super-Resolution by Simple Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Xu Wang, Stefan Atev, John Wright, Gilad Lerman</p><p>Abstract: The problem of efficiently deciding which of a database of models is most similar to a given input query arises throughout modern computer vision. Motivated by applications in recognition, image retrieval and optimization, there has been significant recent interest in the variant of this problem in which the database models are linear subspaces and the input is either a point or a subspace. Current approaches to this problem have poor scaling in high dimensions, and may not guarantee sublinear query complexity. We present a new approach to approximate nearest subspace search, based on a simple, new locality sensitive hash for subspaces. Our approach allows point-tosubspace query for a database of subspaces of arbitrary dimension d, in a time that depends sublinearly on the number of subspaces in the database. The query complexity of our algorithm is linear in the ambient dimension D, allow- ing it to be directly applied to high-dimensional imagery data. Numerical experiments on model problems in image repatching and automatic face recognition confirm the advantages of our algorithm in terms of both speed and accuracy.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.95919108 <a title="96-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Coupled_Dictionary_and_Feature_Space_Learning_with_Applications_to_Cross-Domain_Image_Synthesis_and_Recognition.html">96 iccv-2013-Coupled Dictionary and Feature Space Learning with Applications to Cross-Domain Image Synthesis and Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuqian Zhang, Cun Mu, Han-Wen Kuo, John Wright</p><p>Abstract: Illumination variation remains a central challenge in object detection and recognition. Existing analyses of illumination variation typically pertain to convex, Lambertian objects, and guarantee quality of approximation in an average case sense. We show that it is possible to build models for the set of images across illumination variation with worstcase performance guarantees, for nonconvex Lambertian objects. Namely, a natural verification test based on the distance to the model guarantees to accept any image which can be sufficiently well-approximated by an image of the object under some admissible lighting condition, and guarantees to reject any image that does not have a sufficiently good approximation. These models are generated by sampling illumination directions with sufficient density, which follows from a new perturbation bound for directional illuminated images in the Lambertian model. As the number of such images required for guaranteed verification may be large, we introduce a new formulation for cone preserving dimensionality reduction, which leverages tools from sparse and low-rank decomposition to reduce the complexity, while controlling the approximation error with respect to the original model. 1</p><p>4 0.95176148 <a title="96-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Cascaded_Shape_Space_Pruning_for_Robust_Facial_Landmark_Detection.html">70 iccv-2013-Cascaded Shape Space Pruning for Robust Facial Landmark Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaowei Zhao, Shiguang Shan, Xiujuan Chai, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel cascaded face shape space pruning algorithm for robust facial landmark detection. Through progressively excluding the incorrect candidate shapes, our algorithm can accurately and efficiently achieve the globally optimal shape configuration. Specifically, individual landmark detectors are firstly applied to eliminate wrong candidates for each landmark. Then, the candidate shape space is further pruned by jointly removing incorrect shape configurations. To achieve this purpose, a discriminative structure classifier is designed to assess the candidate shape configurations. Based on the learned discriminative structure classifier, an efficient shape space pruning strategy is proposed to quickly reject most incorrect candidate shapes while preserve the true shape. The proposed algorithm is carefully evaluated on a large set of real world face images. In addition, comparison results on the publicly available BioID and LFW face databases demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><p>5 0.93650627 <a title="96-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Finding_Causal_Interactions_in_Video_Sequences.html">167 iccv-2013-Finding Causal Interactions in Video Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Mustafa Ayazoglu, Burak Yilmaz, Mario Sznaier, Octavia Camps</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of detecting causal interactions in video clips. Specifically, the goal is to detect whether the actions of a given target can be explained in terms of the past actions of a collection of other agents. We propose to solve this problem by recasting it into a directed graph topology identification, where each node corresponds to the observed motion of a given target, and each link indicates the presence of a causal correlation. As shown in the paper, this leads to a block-sparsification problem that can be efficiently solved using a modified Group-Lasso type approach, capable of handling missing data and outliers (due for instance to occlusion and mis-identified correspondences). Moreover, this approach also identifies time instants where the interactions between agents change, thus providing event detection capabilities. These results are illustrated with several examples involving non–trivial interactions amongst several human subjects. 1. Introduction and Motivation The problem of identifying causal interactions amongst targets in a video sequence has been the focus of considerable attention in the past few years. A large portion of the existing body of work in this field uses human annotated video to build a storyline that includes both recognizing the activities involved and the causal relationships between them (see for instance [10] and references therein). While these methods are powerful and work well when suitably annotated data is available, annotating video clips is expensive and parsing relevant actions requires domain knowledge which may not be readily available. Indeed, in many situations, unveiling potentially hidden causal relationships is a first step towards building such knowledge. In this paper we consider the problem of identifying causal interactions amongst targets, not necessarily human, ∗This work was supported by NSF grants IIS–0713003, IIS-1318145, and ECCS–0901433, AFOSR grant FA9559–12–1–0271, and the Alert DHS Center of Excellence under Award Number 2008-ST-061-ED0001 . from unannotated video sequences and without prior domain knowledge. Our approach exploits the concept of “Granger Causality” [9], that formalizes the intuitive idea that ifa time series {x(t)} is causally related to a second one {thya(tt)if}a, ttihmene knowledge }oifs tchaeu past vrealluateesd otfo a{yse}c1to should l{eya(dt t}o, a ebnett kern prediction o thf efu ptuasret vvaalulueess ooff {{yx}}tt+k. In [l1ea4d], Pora ab bheatktearr eprt.e aicl.t successfully vuasleude a frequency domain reformulation of this concept to uncover pairwise interactions in scenarios involving repeating events, such as social games. This technique was later extended in [17] to model causal correlations between human joints and applied to the problem of activity classification. However, since this approach is based upon estimating the crosscovariance density function between events, it cannot handle situations where these events are non repeating, are too rare to provide an accurate estimate, or where these estimates are biased by outliers or missing data. Further, estimating a pairwise measure of causal correlation requires a spectral factorization of the cross-covariance, followed by numerical integration and statistical thresholding, limiting the approach to moderately large problems. To circumvent these problems, in this paper we propose an alternative approach based upon recasting the problem into that of identifying the topology of a sparse (directed) graph, where each node corresponds to the time traces of relevant features of a target, and each link corresponds to a regressor. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 1 using as an example the problem of finding causal relations amongst 4 tennis players, leading to a graph with 4 nodes, and potentially 12 (directed) links. Note that in general, the problem of identifying causal relationships is ill posed (unless one wants to identify the set of all individuals that could possibly have causal connections), due to the existence of secondary interactions. To illustrate this point, consider a very simplistic scenario with three actors A, B, and C, where A copies (with some delay) the actions of B, which in turn mimics C, also with some delay. In this situation, the ac- tions of A can be explained in terms of either those of B delayed one time sample, or those of C delayed by two samples. Thus, an algorithm based upon a statistical analysis 33556758 would identify a causal connection between A and C, even though there is no direct link between them. Further, if the actions of C can be explained by some simple autoregressive model of the form: = C(t) ?aiC(t − i) then it follows that the acti?ons of A can be explained by the same model, e.g. = A(t) ?aiA(t − i) Hence, multiple graphs topologies, some of which include self-loops, can explain the same set of time-series. On the other hand, note that in this situation, the sparsest graph (in the sense of having the fewest links) is the one that correctly captures the causality relations: the most direct cause of A is B and that of B is C, with C potentially being explained by a self-loop. To capture this feature and regularize the problem, in the sequel we will seek to find the sparsest graph, in the sense of having the least number of interconnections, that explains the observed data, reflecting the fact that, when alternative models are possible, often the most parsimonious is the correct one. Our main result shows that the problem of identifying sparse graph structures from observed noisy data can be reduced to a convex optimization problem (via the use of Group Lasso type arguments) that can be efficiently solved.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we provide a formal reformulation of the problem of finding causal relationships between agents as a sparse graph identification problem. In section 3, we show that this problem can be efficiently solved using a re-weighted Group Lasso approach. Moreover, as shown there, the resulting problem can be solved one node at a time using first order methods, which allows for handling situations involving a large number of agents. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated in section 4 using both simple scenarios (for which ground truth is readily available) and video clips of sports, involving complex, nonrepeating interactions amongst many agents.

Consider a scenario with P moving agents, and denote by the 3D homogenous coordinates of the pth individual at time t. Motivated by the idea of Granger Causality, we will say that the actions of this agent depend causally from those in a set Ip (which can possibly contain p itself), if can be written as: Q˜p(t) Q˜p(t) Q˜p(t) ?N = ? ?ajp(n)Q˜j(t − n) +˜ η p(t) +˜ u p(t) (1) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 Here ajp are unknown coefficients, and ˜η p(t) and up(t) represent measurement noise and a piecewise constant signal that is intended to account for relatively rare events that cannot be explained by the (past) actions of other agents. Examples include interactions of an agent with the environment, for instance to avoid obstacles, or changes in the interactions between agents. Since these events are infrequent, we will model as a signal that has (component-wise) a sparse derivative. Note in passing that since (1) involves homogeneous coordinates, the coefficients aj,p(.) satisfy the following constraint1 u ?N ? ?ajp(n) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 =1 (2) Our goal is to identify causal relationships using as data 2D measurements qp(t) in F frames of the affine projections of the 3D coordinates Q˜p(t) of the targets. Note that, under the affine camera assumption, the 2D coordinates are related exactly by the same regressor parameters [2]. Thus, (1) holds if and only if: ?N qp(t) = ? ?ajp(n)qj(t − n) + u˜ p(t) + ηp(t) (3) j?∈Ip ?n=0 In this context, the problem can be precisely stated as: Given qp(t) (in F number of frames) and some a-priori bound N on the order of the regressors (that is the “memory” of the interactions), find the sparsest set of equations of the form (3) that explains the data, that is: aj,pm,ηinp,up?nIp (4) subject to? ?(2) and: = ? ?ajp(n)qj(t − n) + ?N qp(t) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 up(t) + ηp(t) , p = 1 . . . , P and t = 1, ..F 1This follows by considering the third coordinate in (1) (5) where nIp denotes the cardinality of the set Ip.

For instance, [1] proposed a Lasso type algorithm to identify a sparse network where each link corresponds to a VAR process. The main idea underlying this method is to exploit the fact that penalizing the ?1 norm of the vector of regression coefficients tends to produce sparse solutions. However, enforcing sparsity of the entire vector of regressor coefficients does not necessarily result in a sparse graph structure, since the resulting solution can consist of many links, each with a few coefficients. This difficulty can be circumvented by resorting to group Lasso type approaches [18], which seek to enforce block sparsity by using a combination of ?1 and ?2 norm constraints on the coefficients of the regressor. While this approach was shown to work well with artificial data in [11], exact recovery of the underlying network can be only guaranteed when the data satisfies suitable “incoherence” type conditions [4]. Finally, a different approach was pursued in [13], based on the use of a modified Orthogonal Least Squares algorithm, Cyclic Orthogonal Least Squares. However, this approach requires enforcing an a-priori limit on the number of links allowed to point to a single node, and such information may not be readily available, specially in cases where this number has high variability amongst nodes. To address these difficulties, in the next section we develop a convex optimization based approach to the problem of identifying sparse graph structures from observed noisy data. This method is closest in spirit to that in [11], in the sense that it is also based on a group Lasso type argument. The main differences consist in the ability to handle the unknown inputs up(t), needed to model exogenous disturbances affecting the agents, and in a reformulation of the problem, that allows for using a re-weighted iterative type algorithm, leading to substantially sparser solutions, even when the conditions in [4] fail. 3. Causality Identification Algorithm In this section we present the main result of this paper, an algorithm to search for block-sparse solutions to (7). For each fixed p, the algorithm searches for sparse solutions to (6) by solving (iteratively) the following problem (suggested by the re-weighted heuristic proposed in [7]) ?P ap,muxipn,uypi?=1wja(?aip?2) + λ??diag(wu)[Δuxp;Δuyp]??1 subject to: ?ηp ? ≤ p = 1, . . , P. ∞ ?P ?, ?N ??aip(n) i?= ?1 ?n=0 ?. = 1, p = 1,...,P. (9) where [Δuxp ; Δuyp] represents the first order differences of the exogenous input vector [uxp ; uyp], Wa and Wu are weighting matrices, and λ is a Lagrange multiplier that plays the role of a tuning parameter between graph sparsity and event sensitivity. Intuitively, for a fixed set of weights w, the algorithm attempts to find a block sparse solution to (6) and a set of sparse inp?uts Δuxp ; Δuyp , by exploiting the facts that minimizing ?i ?aip ?2 (the ?2,1 norm of the vector sequence {aip}) te?nds? tao m?aximize block-sparsity [18], while minimizing et?nhed s? 1t norm mmaizxeim blizoceks sparsity [ [1168]]. wOhniclee t mheisnesolutions are found, the weights w are adjusted to penalize those elements of the sequences with small values, so that in the next iteration solutions that set these elements to zero (hence further increasing sparsity) are favored. Note however, that proceeding in this way, requires solving at each iteration a problem with n = P(Pnr + F) variables, where P and F denote the number of agents and frames, respectively, and where nr is a bound on the regressor order. On the other hand, it is easily seen that both the objective function and the constraints in (9) can be partitioned into P groups, with the pth group involving only the variables related to the pth node. It follows then that problem (9) can be solved by solving P smaller problems of the form: ?P ap,muxipn,uypi?=1wja(?aip?2) + λ??diag(wu)[Δuxp;Δuyp]??1 ?P subject to: ?ηp?∞ ?N ≤ ? and ??aip(n) i?= ?1 ?n=0 leading to the algorithm given below: =1 (10) Algorithm 1: REWEIGHTEDCAUSALITYALGORITHM for each p wa = [1, 1, ..., 1] = [1, 1, ..., 1] S > 1(self loop weight) s = [1, 1, ..., S, ..., 1] (p’th element is S) while not converged do 1. solve (9) 2. wja = 1/( ?aip ?2 + δ) 3. wja = wja ◦ s (Penalization self loops) 4. = 1./(abs([Δuxp ; Δuyp]) + δ) end while 5. At this point ajp(.) , Ip and up(t) have been identified end for wu wu It is worth emphasizing that, since the computational complexity of standard interior point methods grows as n3, solving these smaller P problems leads to roughly a O(P2) 33557781 reduction in computational time over solving a single, larger optimization. Thus, this approach can handle moderately large problems using standard, interior-point based, semidefinite optimization solvers. Larger problems can be accommodated by noting that the special form of the objective and constraints allow for using iterative Augmented La- grangian Type Methods (ALM), based upon computing, at each step, the closed form solution to suitable intermediate optimization problems. While a complete derivation of such an algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper, using results from [12] it can be shown that each step requires only a combination of thresholding and least-squares approximations. Moreover, it can be shown that such an algorithm converges Q-superlinearly. 4. Handling Outliers and Missing Data The algorithm outlined above assumes an ideal situation where the data matrix B is perfectly known. However, in practice many of its elements may be outliers (due to misidentified correspondences) or missing (due to occlusion). As we briefly show next, these situations can be efficiently handled by performing a structured robust PCA step [3] to obtain a “clean” data matrix, prior to applying Algorithm 1. From equation (6) it follows that, in the absence of exogenous inputs and noise: ?xy11.. . .yxPP? = ?XY11.. . .YXPP? ?a1...aP? (11) Since xi ∈ {col(Xj)} and yi ∈ {col(Yj }), it follows that the sets {∈co {l(cXoli(X)} a)n}d a n{dco yl(Y∈i) { }c? are self-ex?pressive, or, ?equivalently?, Xthe }ma atnridce {sc oXl( =.) }? aXre1 . . . fX-eNxp? eanssdiv eY, ?Y1 ...YN? are mraantkri cdeesfic Xient. ?Consider no?w the case =.r, w?here some ?elements xi, yi of X and Y are missing.

Experimental Results In this section we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using several video clips (provided as supplemental material). The results of the experiments are displayed using graphs embedded on the video frames: An arrow indicates causal correlation between agents, with the point of the arrow indicating the agent whose actions are affected by the agent at its tail. The internal parameters of the algorithm were experimentally tuned, leading to the values ? = 0.1, = 0.05, self loop weights S = 10. The algorithm is fairly insensitive to the value of the regularization parameters and S, which could be adjusted up or down by an order of magnitude without affecting the structure of the resulting graph. Finally, we used regressor order N=2 for the first three examples and N=4 for the last one, a choice that is consistent with the frame rate and the complexity of λ λ the actions taking place in each clip. 5.1. Clips from the UT-Interaction Data Set We considered two video clips from the UT Human Interaction Data Set [15] (sequences 6 and 16). Figures 2 and 5 compare the results obtained applying the proposed algorithm versus Group Lasso (GL) [11] and Group Lasso combined with the reweighted heuristic described in (9) (GLRW). In all cases, the inputs to the algorithm were the (approximate) coordinates of the heads of each of the agents, normalized to the interval [−1, 1], artificially corrupted ,w niothrm m10al%iz eodut tloie trhs.e Notably, [t−he1 proposed algorithm 2As shown in [6, 8] under suitable conditions these relaxations the exact minimum rank solution. 33557792 recover Figure 2.

Only the proposed method identifies the correct connections. was able to correctly identify the correlations between the agents from this very limited amount of information, while the others failed to do so. Note in passing that in both cases none of the algorithms were directly applicable, due to some of the individuals leaving the field of view or being occluded. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the missing data was recovered by solving an RPCA problem prior to applying Algorithm 1. Finally, Fig. 4 sheds more insight on the key role played by the sparse signal u. As shown there, changes in u correspond exactly to time instants when the behavior of the corresponding agent deviates from the general pattern followed during most of the clip. Figure 3. Time traces of the individual heads in the UT sequence 6, artificially corrupted with 10 % outliers. The outliers were removed and the missing data due to targets leaving the field of view was estimated solving a modified RPCA problem. Frame number Figure 4.

Doubles Tennis Experiment This experiment considers a non-staged real-life scenario. The data consists of 230 frames of a video clip from the Australian Open Tennis Doubles Final games. The goal here is to identify causal relationships between the different players using time traces of the respective centroid positions. Note that in this case the ground truth is not available. Nevertheless, since players from the same team usually look at their opponents and react to their motions, we expect a strong causality connection between members of 33557803 opposite teams. This intuition is matched by the correlations unveiled by the algorithm, shown in Fig. 6. The identified sparse input corresponding to the vertical direction is shown in Fig. 7 (similar results for the horizontal component are omitted due to space reasons.) Figure 6. Sample frames from the tennis sequence. Top: The proposed method correctly identifies interactions between opposite team members. Center: Reweighted Group Lasso misses the interaction between the two rear-most individuals of opposite teams, generating self loops instead (denoted by the disks). Bottom: Group Lasso yields an almost complete graph. Figure 7. Exogenous signal corresponding to the vertical axis for the tennis sequence. The change in one component corresponds to the instant when the leftmost player in the bottom team moves from the line towards the net, remaining closer to it from then on. 5.3. Basketball Game Experiment This experiment considers the interactions amongst players in a basketball game. As in the case ofthe tennis players, since the data comes from a real life scenario, the ground truth is not available. However, contrary to the tennis game, this scenario involves complex interactions amongst many players, and causality is hard to discern by inspection. Nevertheless, the results shown in Fig. 8, obtained using the position of the centroids as inputs to our algorithm, match our intuition. Firstly, one would expect a strong cause/effect connection between the actions of the player with the ball and the two defending opponents facing him. These connections (denoted by the yellow arrows) were indeed successfully identified by the algorithm. The next set of causal correlations is represented by the (blue, light green) and (black, white) arrow pairs showing the defending and the opponent players on the far side of the field and under the hoop. An important, counterintuitive, connection identified by the algorithm is represented by the magenta arrows be- tween the right winger of the white team with two of his teammates: the one holding the ball and the one running behind all players. While at first sight this connection is not as obvious as the others, it becomes apparent towards the end of the sequence, when the right winger player is signaling with a raised arm. Notably, our algorithm was able to unveil this signaling without the need to perform a semantic analysis (a very difficult task here, since this signaling is apparent only in the last few frames). Rather, it used the fact that the causal correlation was encapsulated in the dynamics of the relative motions of these players. 6. Conclusions In this paper we propose a new method for detecting causal interactions between agents using video data. The main idea is to recast this problem into a blind directed graph topology identification, where each node corresponds to the observed motion of a given target, each link indicates the presence of a causal correlation and the unknown inputs account for changes in the interaction patterns. In turn, this problem can be reduced to that of finding block-sparse solutions to a set of linear equations, which can be efficiently accomplished using an iterative re-weighted Group-Lasso approach. The ability of the algorithm to correctly identify causal correlations, even in cases where portions of the data record are missing or corrupted by outliers, and the key role played by the unknown exogenous input were illustrated with several examples involving non–trivial inter- actions amongst several human subjects. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm was able to identify both the correct interactions and the time instants when interactions amongst agents changed, based on minimal motion information: in all cases we used just a single time trace per person. This success indicates that in many scenarios, the dynamic information contained in the motion pattern of a single feature associated with a target is rich enough to enable identifying complex interaction patterns, without the need to track multiple features, perform a semantic analysis or use additional domain knowledge. 33557814 Figure 8.

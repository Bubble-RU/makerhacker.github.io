<p>Author: Daozheng Chen, Dhruv Batra, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: Latent variables models have been applied to a number of computer vision problems. However, the complexity of the latent space is typically left as a free design choice. A larger latent space results in a more expressive model, but such models are prone to overfitting and are slower to perform inference with. The goal of this paper is to regularize the complexity of the latent space and learn which hidden states are really relevant for prediction. Specifically, we propose using group-sparsity-inducing regularizers such as ?1-?2 to estimate the parameters of Structured SVMs with unstructured latent variables. Our experiments on digit recognition and object detection show that our approach is indeed able to control the complexity of latent space without any significant loss in accuracy of the learnt model.</p><p>3 0.13155441 <a title="75-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-stage_Contextual_Deep_Learning_for_Pedestrian_Detection.html">279 iccv-2013-Multi-stage Contextual Deep Learning for Pedestrian Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xingyu Zeng, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Cascaded classifiers1 have been widely used in pedestrian detection and achieved great success. These classifiers are trained sequentially without joint optimization. In this paper, we propose a new deep model that can jointly train multi-stage classifiers through several stages of backpropagation. It keeps the score map output by a classifier within a local region and uses it as contextual information to support the decision at the next stage. Through a specific design of the training strategy, this deep architecture is able to simulate the cascaded classifiers by mining hard samples to train the network stage-by-stage. Each classifier handles samples at a different difficulty level. Unsupervised pre-training and specifically designed stage-wise supervised training are used to regularize the optimization problem. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the training strategy helps to avoid overfitting. Experimental results on three datasets (Caltech, ETH and TUD-Brussels) show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.</p><p>4 0.11918485 <a title="75-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Improving_Graph_Matching_via_Density_Maximization.html">214 iccv-2013-Improving Graph Matching via Density Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Chao Wang, Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching has been widely used in various applications in computer vision due to its powerful performance. However, it poses three challenges to image sparse feature matching: (1) The combinatorial nature limits the size of the possible matches; (2) It is sensitive to outliers because the objective function prefers more matches; (3) It works poorly when handling many-to-many object correspondences, due to its assumption of one single cluster for each graph. In this paper, we address these problems with a unified framework—Density Maximization. We propose a graph density local estimator (퐷퐿퐸) to measure the quality of matches. Density Maximization aims to maximize the 퐷퐿퐸 values both locally and globally. The local maximization of 퐷퐿퐸 finds the clusters of nodes as well as eliminates the outliers. The global maximization of 퐷퐿퐸 efficiently refines the matches by exploring a much larger matching space. Our Density Maximization is orthogonal to specific graph matching algorithms. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that it significantly boosts the true matches and enables graph matching to handle both outliers and many-to-many object correspondences.</p><p>5 0.11904413 <a title="75-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Breaking_the_Chain%3A_Liberation_from_the_Temporal_Markov_Assumption_for_Tracking_Human_Poses.html">65 iccv-2013-Breaking the Chain: Liberation from the Temporal Markov Assumption for Tracking Human Poses</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Tokola, Wongun Choi, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to multi-target tracking that has expressive potential beyond the capabilities of chainshaped hidden Markov models, yet has significantly reduced complexity. Our framework, which we call tracking-byselection, is similar to tracking-by-detection in that it separates the tasks of detection and tracking, but it shifts tempo-labs . com Stanford, CA ssi lvio @ st an ford . edu ral reasoning from the tracking stage to the detection stage. The core feature of tracking-by-selection is that it reasons about path hypotheses that traverse the entire video instead of a chain of single-frame object hypotheses. A traditional chain-shaped tracking-by-detection model is only able to promote consistency between one frame and the next. In tracking-by-selection, path hypotheses exist across time, and encouraging long-term temporal consistency is as simple as rewarding path hypotheses with consistent image features. One additional advantage of tracking-by-selection is that it results in a dramatically simplified model that can be solved exactly. We adapt an existing tracking-by-detection model to the tracking-by-selectionframework, and show improvedperformance on a challenging dataset (introduced in [18]).</p><p>6 0.11204977 <a title="75-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Handling_Occlusions_with_Franken-Classifiers.html">190 iccv-2013-Handling Occlusions with Franken-Classifiers</a></p>

<p>Author: Tianfu Wu, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Many object detectors, such as AdaBoost, SVM and deformable part-based models (DPM), compute additive scoring functions at a large number of windows scanned over image pyramid, thus computational efficiency is an important consideration beside accuracy performance. In this paper, we present a framework of learning cost-sensitive decision policy which is a sequence of two-sided thresholds to execute early rejection or early acceptance based on the accumulative scores at each step. A decision policy is said to be optimal if it minimizes an empirical global risk function that sums over the loss of false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP), and the cost of computation. While the risk function is very complex due to high-order connections among the two-sided thresholds, we find its upper bound can be optimized by dynamic programming (DP) efficiently and thus say the learned policy is near-optimal. Given the loss of FN and FP and the cost in three numbers, our method can produce a policy on-the-fly for Adaboost, SVM and DPM. In experiments, we show that our decision policy outperforms state-of-the-art cascade methods significantly in terms of speed with similar accuracy performance.</p><p>3 0.75394326 <a title="75-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_Pedestrian_Detection_by_Directly_Optimizing_the_Partial_Area_under_the_ROC_Curve.html">136 iccv-2013-Efficient Pedestrian Detection by Directly Optimizing the Partial Area under the ROC Curve</a></p>
<p>Author: Sakrapee Paisitkriangkrai, Chunhua Shen, Anton Van Den Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Many typical applications of object detection operate within a prescribed false-positive range. In this situation the performance of a detector should be assessed on the basis of the area under the ROC curve over that range, rather than over the full curve, as the performance outside the range is irrelevant. This measure is labelled as the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC). Effective cascade-based classification, for example, depends on training node classifiers that achieve the maximal detection rate at a moderate false positive rate, e.g., around 40% to 50%. We propose a novel ensemble learning method which achieves a maximal detection rate at a user-defined range of false positive rates by directly optimizing the partial AUC using structured learning. By optimizing for different ranges of false positive rates, the proposed method can be used to train either a single strong classifier or a node classifier forming part of a cascade classifier. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors using the pro- posed structured ensemble learning method.</p><p>4 0.74199569 <a title="75-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Training_Deformable_Part_Models_with_Decorrelated_Features.html">426 iccv-2013-Training Deformable Part Models with Decorrelated Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Ross Girshick, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we show how to train a deformable part model (DPM) fast—typically in less than 20 minutes, or four times faster than the current fastest method—while maintaining high average precision on the PASCAL VOC datasets. At the core of our approach is “latent LDA,” a novel generalization of linear discriminant analysis for learning latent variable models. Unlike latent SVM, latent LDA uses efficient closed-form updates and does not require an expensive search for hard negative examples. Our approach also acts as a springboard for a detailed experimental study of DPM training. We isolate and quantify the impact of key training factors for the first time (e.g., How important are discriminative SVM filters? How important is joint parameter estimation? How many negative images are needed for training?). Our findings yield useful insights for researchers working with Markov random fields and partbased models, and have practical implications for speeding up tasks such as model selection.</p><p>5 0.71651328 <a title="75-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Group_Norm_for_Learning_Structured_SVMs_with_Unstructured_Latent_Variables.html">187 iccv-2013-Group Norm for Learning Structured SVMs with Unstructured Latent Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Wufeng Xue, Xuanqin Mou, Lei Zhang, Xiangchu Feng</p><p>Abstract: How to measure the perceptual quality of natural images is an important problem in low level vision. It is known that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is not an effective index to describe the perceptual fidelity of images. Numerous perceptual fidelity indices have been developed, while the representatives include the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index and its variants. However, most of those perceptual measures are nonlinear, and they cannot be easily adopted as an objective function to minimize in various low level vision tasks. Can MSE be perceptual fidelity aware after some minor adaptation ? In this paper we propose a simple framework to enhance the perceptual fidelity awareness of MSE by introducing an l2-norm structural error term to it. Such a Structural MSE (SMSE) can lead to very competitive image quality assessment (IQA) results. More surprisingly, we show that by using certain structure extractors, SMSE can befurther turned into a Gaussian smoothed MSE (i.e., the Euclidean distance between the original and distorted images after Gaussian , smooth filtering), which is much simpler to calculate but achieves rather better IQA performance than SSIM. The socalled Perceptual-fidelity Aware MSE (PAMSE) can have great potentials in applications such as perceptual image coding and perceptual image restoration.</p><p>2 0.87670422 <a title="75-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Directed_Acyclic_Graph_Kernels_for_Action_Recognition.html">116 iccv-2013-Directed Acyclic Graph Kernels for Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ling Wang, Hichem Sahbi</p><p>Abstract: One of the trends of action recognition consists in extracting and comparing mid-level features which encode visual and motion aspects of objects into scenes. However, when scenes contain high-level semantic actions with many interacting parts, these mid-level features are not sufficient to capture high level structures as well as high order causal relationships between moving objects resulting into a clear drop in performances. In this paper, we address this issue and we propose an alternative action recognition method based on a novel graph kernel. In the main contributions of this work, we first describe actions in videos using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), that naturally encode pairwise interactions between moving object parts, and then we compare these DAGs by analyzing the spectrum of their sub-patterns that capture complex higher order interactions. This extraction and comparison process is computationally tractable, re- sulting from the acyclic property of DAGs, and it also defines a positive semi-definite kernel. When plugging the latter into support vector machines, we obtain an action recognition algorithm that overtakes related work, including graph-based methods, on a standard evaluation dataset.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.83708471 <a title="75-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-CoDeL%3A_A_Human_Co-detection_and_Labeling_Framework.html">75 iccv-2013-CoDeL: A Human Co-detection and Labeling Framework</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianping Shi, Renjie Liao, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: We propose a co-detection and labeling (CoDeL) framework to identify persons that contain self-consistent appearance in multiple images. Our CoDeL model builds upon the deformable part-based model to detect human hypotheses and exploits cross-image correspondence via a matching classifier. Relying on a Gaussian process, this matching classifier models the similarity of two hypotheses and efficiently captures the relative importance contributed by various visual features, reducing the adverse effect of scattered occlusion. Further, the detector and matching classifier together make our modelfit into a semi-supervised co-training framework, which can get enhanced results with a small amount of labeled training data. Our CoDeL model achieves decent performance on existing and new benchmark datasets.</p><p>4 0.83572489 <a title="75-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-The_Moving_Pose%3A_An_Efficient_3D_Kinematics_Descriptor_for_Low-Latency_Action_Recognition_and_Detection.html">417 iccv-2013-The Moving Pose: An Efficient 3D Kinematics Descriptor for Low-Latency Action Recognition and Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Mihai Zanfir, Marius Leordeanu, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Human action recognition under low observational latency is receiving a growing interest in computer vision due to rapidly developing technologies in human-robot interaction, computer gaming and surveillance. In this paper we propose a fast, simple, yet powerful non-parametric Moving Pose (MP)frameworkfor low-latency human action and activity recognition. Central to our methodology is a moving pose descriptor that considers both pose information as well as differential quantities (speed and acceleration) of the human body joints within a short time window around the current frame. The proposed descriptor is used in conjunction with a modified kNN classifier that considers both the temporal location of a particular frame within the action sequence as well as the discrimination power of its moving pose descriptor compared to other frames in the training set. The resulting method is non-parametric and enables low-latency recognition, one-shot learning, and action detection in difficult unsegmented sequences. Moreover, the framework is real-time, scalable, and outperforms more sophisticated approaches on challenging benchmarks like MSR-Action3D or MSR-DailyActivities3D.</p><p>5 0.83296871 <a title="75-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Synopsis_by_Heterogeneous_Multi-source_Correlation.html">443 iccv-2013-Video Synopsis by Heterogeneous Multi-source Correlation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiatian Zhu, Chen Change Loy, Shaogang Gong</p><p>Abstract: Generating coherent synopsis for surveillance video stream remains a formidable challenge due to the ambiguity and uncertainty inherent to visual observations. In contrast to existing video synopsis approaches that rely on visual cues alone, we propose a novel multi-source synopsis framework capable of correlating visual data and independent non-visual auxiliary information to better describe and summarise subtlephysical events in complex scenes. Specifically, our unsupervised framework is capable of seamlessly uncovering latent correlations among heterogeneous types of data sources, despite the non-trivial heteroscedasticity and dimensionality discrepancy problems. Additionally, the proposed model is robust to partial or missing non-visual information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on two crowded public surveillance datasets.</p><p>6 0.8323971 <a title="75-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Near-Optimal_Cost-Sensitive_Decision_Policy_for_Object_Detection.html">241 iccv-2013-Learning Near-Optimal Cost-Sensitive Decision Policy for Object Detection</a></p>

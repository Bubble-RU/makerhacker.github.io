</p><p>7 Introduction Accurately detecting facial landmarks in images is essential for many computer vision tasks, such as face recognition, facial expression recognition, 3D face modeling and face animation. [sent-17, score-1.636]
</p><p>8 Yet, locating facial landmarks in face images captured under unconstrained real world environment remains challenging, due to tremendous variations in facial appearance caused by pose, lighting, partial occlusion and so on. [sent-18, score-1.318]
</p><p>9 Generally speaking, given a face image, the goal of facial landmark detection is to find the most correct shape (in terms of the concatenation of the landmarks coordinates) from all possible landmarks configurations according to some criteria. [sent-19, score-1.961]
</p><p>10 In this kind of method, the facial landmarks are detected separately. [sent-22, score-0.716]
</p><p>11 However, one drawback of this kind of method is that it is insufficient to reliably detect facial landmarks just using local texture information, especially under complex environment. [sent-25, score-0.716]
</p><p>12 To address this problem, the relationship among facial landmarks should be utilized to eliminate the false positive detections. [sent-28, score-0.685]
</p><p>13 Another kind of very popular facial landmark detection methods is the Active Shape Model (ASM) [6] and Active Appearance Model (AAM) [4]. [sent-29, score-0.985]
</p><p>14 In addition, many variants of ASM and AAM [2, 5, 8, 16, 17, 20, 29] are proposed to further improve the accuracy of facial landmark detection. [sent-30, score-0.895]
</p><p>15 Typically, in these methods, the shape configuration of facial landmarks is required to satisfy some statistical constraints, which are characterized by the Point Distribution Model (PDM) [6]. [sent-31, score-1.036]
</p><p>16 For example, in original AAM [4], the shape parameters are estimated through minimizing the residual between the face appearance and the synthesized face template. [sent-33, score-0.598]
</p><p>17 In addition, works [5, 6, 8, 17, 20] essentially formulate the facial landmark detection as a posterior maximization problem and solve it through iteratively search or EM-like algorithms. [sent-37, score-0.954]
</p><p>18 In recent years, there also appeared a few methods,  which learn a regression function that directly maps the global or local image appearance to the target facial land11003333  removing wrong candidate points via independent landmark detectors Figure 1. [sent-41, score-1.316]
</p><p>19 Overview of our robust facial landmark detection algorithm by cascaded shape space pruning. [sent-42, score-1.446]
</p><p>20 For the convenience of illustration, only five fiducial facial landmarks  (e. [sent-43, score-0.717]
</p><p>21 In these methods, the inherent geometric constraint among facial landmarks is implicitly encoded into the regressor. [sent-49, score-0.685]
</p><p>22 In short, above-mentioned facial landmark detection algorithms still have certain drawbacks in obtaining the opti-  mal shape configurations, such as the local maximum problem of ASMs and AAMs and the ambiguity problem of individual landmark detectors, etc. [sent-51, score-1.721]
</p><p>23 To address these problems, in this paper, a novel facial landmark detection algorithm is proposed, which can efficiently achieve the globally optimal shape configuration from the entire candidate shape space. [sent-52, score-1.898]
</p><p>24 In each stage, part of the incorrect shape configurations is filtered out efficiently from the candidate shape space. [sent-54, score-1.0]
</p><p>25 In our implementation, the candidate shape space is firstly pruned by individually removing impossible positions of each landmark with separate landmark detector. [sent-55, score-1.749]
</p><p>26 Subsequently, in the later stages, all of the facial landmarks are considered as a whole and jointly evaluated by a discriminative structure classifier, which is learned using Structured Output SVM (SOSVM) [24]. [sent-56, score-0.833]
</p><p>27 Based on the discriminative structure classifier, an efficient pruning strategy is proposed to remove the incorrect candidate shape configurations quickly at the global shape level. [sent-57, score-1.281]
</p><p>28 Finally, in the remaining compact candidate shape space, the globally optimal shape configuration can be easily obtained via non-maximum suppression. [sent-58, score-0.939]
</p><p>29 We evaluate our algorithm in detail and compare it with a range of commonly used facial landmark detection algorithms. [sent-59, score-0.954]

</p><p>33 Section 2 gives a brief overview of our robust facial landmark detection algorithm. [sent-65, score-0.954]
</p><p>34 Section 3 presents more details of our algorithm, including shape space pruning by individually and jointly removing incorrect positions for facial landmarks. [sent-66, score-1.262]
</p><p>35 Basic idea In this section, we will first give a formulation of the facial landmark detection problem and then briefly describe  the basic idea of our algorithm for solving the problem. [sent-70, score-0.979]
</p><p>36 As described in Section 1, the task of facial landmark detection is to find the optimal shape s∗ = [x1, y1, x2 , y2 , . [sent-71, score-1.267]

</p><p>38 In this paper, we try to estimate the globally optimal landmarks configuration through progressively filtering out the incorrect shapes. [sent-78, score-0.578]
</p><p>39 In each cascade stage i, most incorrect candidate shapes are fast rejected by criterion function fi, i. [sent-83, score-0.592]
</p><p>40 Giv-  en an input face image, the candidate shape space is firstly pruned by removing incorrect candidate points for each facial landmark. [sent-88, score-1.71]
</p><p>41 Specifically, for landmark li, if we remove one of its candidate points ci, then the shapes with li = ci will be rejected. [sent-89, score-0.767]
</p><p>42 If there are Ni candidate points remained for landmark li, the size of candidate shape subspace is reduced to ? [sent-90, score-1.22]
</p><p>43 uently, in the remaining cascade stages, the candidate shape space are further pruned by jointly removing the incorrect candidate shape configurations. [sent-97, score-1.453]
</p><p>44 Specifically, all of the facial landmarks are jointly modeled as a tree structure, as shown in Figure 2. [sent-98, score-0.732]
</p><p>45 Based on the discriminative structure classifier, a very efficient shape space pruning strategy is applied to reject incorrect candidate shapes quickly. [sent-100, score-1.135]
</p><p>46 The implementation details of the discriminative structure classifier and the shape space pruning algorithm are described in Section 3. [sent-101, score-0.66]
</p><p>47 Each node in V represents a facial landmark, and the edges in E characterize the geometric shape deformation among facial landmarks. [sent-105, score-1.166]
</p><p>48 Finally, in the pruned and compact enough shape space, the optimal shape configuration can be easily obtained through the non-maximum suppression fusion technique. [sent-107, score-0.831]
</p><p>49 Facial  landmark  detection  by  cascaded  shape space pruning In this section, we describe the details of our cascaded shape space pruning algorithm. [sent-109, score-1.931]
</p><p>50 Shape space pruning by individually removing landmark candidates In our algorithm, the candidate shape space is firstly pruned by individually removing candidate points for each landmark. [sent-112, score-1.899]
</p><p>51 To achieve this purpose, independent landmark detectors are trained to reject the incorrect candidate points. [sent-113, score-0.918]
</p><p>52 For each facial landmark l, a landmark detector is trained using the Real AdaBoost classifier. [sent-114, score-1.359]
</p><p>53 With the learned landmark detector, each candidate point c is assigned a confidence. [sent-118, score-0.697]
</p><p>54 Correspondingly, the candidate shape configurations with l = c should be rejected. [sent-120, score-0.552]
</p><p>55 In addition, several landmark detectors are cascaded for faster candidate points removing, as done in [26]. [sent-121, score-0.892]
</p><p>56 Shape space pruning by jointly removing candidate landmark positions In this subsection, all of the facial landmarks are considered as a whole and jointly assessed by a discriminative 11003355  Figure x-axis tance) turned  ×  MMaaxx. [sent-126, score-1.856]
</p><p>57 Besides, an efficient pruning strategy is proposed to fast reject the incorrect candidate shapes. [sent-133, score-0.641]
</p><p>58 1  Face shape assessment via discriminative structure classifier  The basic idea of our algorithm evaluating the quality of candidate shape is to learn a discriminative structure classifier F : X S → R over image-shape pairs. [sent-136, score-1.025]
</p><p>59 outputs a  score, with the constrains that the score of a true shape should be greater than that of any other wrong shape s ∈ S\ˆ s: F(I, s) > F(I, s). [sent-139, score-0.711]
</p><p>60 (3)  where Ψ(I, s) is the feature vector extracted from image I according to landmark configuration s, and w is the parameter vector. [sent-142, score-0.533]
</p><p>61 As shown in Figure 2, the geometric relationship among facial landmarks is modeled as a tree-structured model T = (V, E) [11, 30], where V is the set of facial landmarks, E is the set of edges connecting facial landmarks. [sent-143, score-1.547]
</p><p>62 Illustration of the shape space pruning at the global shape level. [sent-162, score-0.817]
</p><p>63 It is expected that the true shape s lies in the pruned shape space S in a very high probability, and most incorrect shapes are excluded. [sent-164, score-1.02]
</p><p>64 However, in practice, it is hard to learn an ideal F(I, s) such that the optimal shape s∗ is exact or very close to the true shape The reason mainly lies in the weak expression capability of image features and the linear modeling of F(I, s). [sent-171, score-0.714]
</p><p>65 It can be observed that: (1) We can easily reject the shapes which are far away from the true shape (e. [sent-174, score-0.513]
</p><p>66 2); (2) The maximal score is not exactly at the true shape, but at the shape which is near to the true shape (e. [sent-177, score-0.697]
</p><p>67 2  Efficient shape space pruning  Based on the analysis in Section 3. [sent-184, score-0.535]
</p><p>68 1, in this subsection, we propose an approach to efficiently prune the candidate shape space at the global shape level. [sent-186, score-0.849]
</p><p>69 As shown in Figure 4, instead of directly predicting the optimal shape configuration s∗, we turn to predict a shape subspace S, which excludes incorrect candidate shapes as much as possible and simultaneously includes the true shape in a very high probability. [sent-187, score-1.461]
</p><p>70 The basic assumption  s  11003366  is that the optimal shape configuration s∗ estimated accord-  ing to F(I, s) is not far away from the true shape predicted shape subspace can be expressed as: S = {s : | ? [sent-188, score-1.051]
</p><p>71 Here, s∗ is the center of shape space S, r is a threshold which constrains that the maximum deviation of to the true shape s∗ . [sent-192, score-0.773]
</p><p>72 It is important to note that in our strategy presented above, we do NOT filter out the incorrect candidate shapes simply by thresholding the score of F(I, s), which although seems more natural for shape pruning. [sent-196, score-0.772]
</p><p>73 The most important reason is, in such an alternative strategy, every candidate shape have to be assessed by ? [sent-197, score-0.521]
</p><p>74 Similar to independent landmark detectors, the learned prediction functions are also cascaded for a coarse-to-fine shape space pruning. [sent-200, score-0.978]
</p><p>75 Along with the reduction of the solution space, we give more trust to the local texture rather than the global shape constraints among facial landmarks. [sent-202, score-0.713]
</p><p>76 =M1Δ( sˆi,si) − ξ (7)  where Δ(ˆ si, si) is a loss function which measures the loss of a shape si if the expected shape is si, λ is a regularization term. [sent-220, score-0.635]
</p><p>77 For the same face image, they do not have constrains on the relation between the true shape and outlier shapes s ∈ S\ˆ s at all. [sent-227, score-0.625]
</p><p>78 To train the individual landmark detectors and the structure classifier, we collect about 7,000 face images from multiple databases, such as CMU PIE [21], FRGC v1 [18], CAS-PEAL [12], FG-NET Aging [1], and CMU Multi-PIE [13]. [sent-235, score-0.7]
</p><p>79 In our experiments, the normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) relative to the ground truth is adopted as the error measurement for the facial landmark detection. [sent-245, score-0.895]
</p><p>80 The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of NRMSE is used to evaluate the performance of facial landmark detection algorithm. [sent-247, score-0.954]
</p><p>81 Training In our experiments, nine facial landmarks are localized and evaluated, which include two eye centers, four eye corners, two mouth corners and the nose tip. [sent-250, score-0.938]
</p><p>82 lTsh eaw wcaaysca frdoemd Real AdaBoost algorithm is exploited to train the individual facial landmark detectors. [sent-256, score-0.895]
</p><p>83 Specifically, in our implementation, the nine facial landmarks form a tree structure and two different structure classifiers are cascaded to progressively prune candidate shape space. [sent-258, score-1.501]
</p><p>84 Algorithm analysis In this subsection, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed cascaded shape space pruning algorithm on 13,233 face images from the LFW face database. [sent-263, score-1.02]
</p><p>85 Here, for the convenience of expression, we briefly note the procedure that pruning shape space by independent landmark detectors as “S 1”. [sent-264, score-1.104]
</p><p>86 1  Efficiency of shape space pruning  In order to analyze the efficiency of shape space pruning, three kinds of criteria are designed in our experiments: •  •  Candidates Size. [sent-268, score-0.858]
</p><p>87 It can be observed that: (1) The remaining candidate number is greatly reduced after each stage; (2) The maximum deviation of each landmark to the ground truth is reduced from about (0. [sent-284, score-0.75]

</p><p>89 2  Performance improvement of each stage  In this subsection, we will validate the effectiveness of the  ×  cascaded shape space pruning to improve the performance of facial landmark detection. [sent-296, score-1.642]
</p><p>90 The average detection accuracy of nine facial landmarks is explored. [sent-298, score-0.783]
</p><p>91 05, the detection accuracy of “S3” is about 10% higher than detection accuracy of “S2”, which shows that we can get more accurate landmark position in the pruned shape space. [sent-303, score-1.003]
</p><p>92 Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods In recent years, some promising methods for robust facial landmark detection emerge [10, 17, 20, 22, 25, 30]. [sent-311, score-0.954]
</p><p>93 It can be observed that our method can locate the facial landmarks robust and accurately on images with exaggerate facial expression and partial occlusion. [sent-328, score-1.187]

<p>Author: Xiang Yu, Junzhou Huang, Shaoting Zhang, Wang Yan, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of facial landmark localization and tracking from a single camera. We present a two-stage cascaded deformable shape model to effectively and efficiently localize facial landmarks with large head pose variations. For face detection, we propose a group sparse learning method to automatically select the most salient facial landmarks. By introducing 3D face shape model, we use procrustes analysis to achieve pose-free facial landmark initialization. For deformation, the first step uses mean-shift local search with constrained local model to rapidly approach the global optimum. The second step uses component-wise active contours to discriminatively refine the subtle shape variation. Our framework can simultaneously handle face detection, pose-free landmark localization and tracking in real time. Extensive experiments are conducted on both laboratory environmental face databases and face-in-the-wild databases. All results demonstrate that our approach has certain advantages over state-of-theart methods in handling pose variations1.</p><p>3 0.378001 <a title="70-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Exemplar-Based_Graph_Matching_for_Robust_Facial_Landmark_Localization.html">149 iccv-2013-Exemplar-Based Graph Matching for Robust Facial Landmark Localization</a></p>
<p>Author: Feng Zhou, Jonathan Brandt, Zhe Lin</p><p>Abstract: Localizing facial landmarks is a fundamental step in facial image analysis. However, the problem is still challenging due to the large variability in pose and appearance, and the existence ofocclusions in real-worldface images. In this paper, we present exemplar-based graph matching (EGM), a robust framework for facial landmark localization. Compared to conventional algorithms, EGM has three advantages: (1) an affine-invariant shape constraint is learned online from similar exemplars to better adapt to the test face; (2) the optimal landmark configuration can be directly obtained by solving a graph matching problem with the learned shape constraint; (3) the graph matching problem can be optimized efficiently by linear programming. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply a graph matching technique for facial landmark localization. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantages of EGM over state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.34982795 <a title="70-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Accurate_and_Robust_3D_Facial_Capture_Using_a_Single_RGBD_Camera.html">36 iccv-2013-Accurate and Robust 3D Facial Capture Using a Single RGBD Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Yen-Lin Chen, Hsiang-Tao Wu, Fuhao Shi, Xin Tong, Jinxiang Chai</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an automatic and robust approach that accurately captures high-quality 3D facial performances using a single RGBD camera. The key of our approach is to combine the power of automatic facial feature detection and image-based 3D nonrigid registration techniques for 3D facial reconstruction. In particular, we develop a robust and accurate image-based nonrigid registration algorithm that incrementally deforms a 3D template mesh model to best match observed depth image data and important facial features detected from single RGBD images. The whole process is fully automatic and robust because it is based on single frame facial registration framework. The system is flexible because it does not require any strong 3D facial priors such as blendshape models. We demonstrate the power of our approach by capturing a wide range of 3D facial expressions using a single RGBD camera and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy by comparing against alternative methods.</p><p>5 0.2573303 <a title="70-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Sieving_Regression_Forest_Votes_for_Facial_Feature_Detection_in_the_Wild.html">391 iccv-2013-Sieving Regression Forest Votes for Facial Feature Detection in the Wild</a></p>
<p>Author: Heng Yang, Ioannis Patras</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a method for the localization of multiple facial features on challenging face images. In the regression forests (RF) framework, observations (patches) that are extracted at several image locations cast votes for the localization of several facial features. In order to filter out votes that are not relevant, we pass them through two types of sieves, that are organised in a cascade, and which enforce geometric constraints. The first sieve filters out votes that are not consistent with a hypothesis for the location of the face center. Several sieves of the second type, one associated with each individual facial point, filter out distant votes. We propose a method that adjusts onthe-fly the proximity threshold of each second type sieve by applying a classifier which, based on middle-level features extracted from voting maps for the facial feature in question, makes a sequence of decisions on whether the threshold should be reduced or not. We validate our proposed method on two challenging datasets with images collected from the Internet in which we obtain state of the art results without resorting to explicit facial shape models. We also show the benefits of our method for proximity threshold adjustment especially on ’difficult’ face images.</p><p>6 0.23264253 <a title="70-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Faces_Guided_Sparse_Many-to-One_Encoder_for_Pose-Invariant_Face_Recognition.html">335 iccv-2013-Random Faces Guided Sparse Many-to-One Encoder for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiang Yu, Junzhou Huang, Shaoting Zhang, Wang Yan, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of facial landmark localization and tracking from a single camera. We present a two-stage cascaded deformable shape model to effectively and efficiently localize facial landmarks with large head pose variations. For face detection, we propose a group sparse learning method to automatically select the most salient facial landmarks. By introducing 3D face shape model, we use procrustes analysis to achieve pose-free facial landmark initialization. For deformation, the first step uses mean-shift local search with constrained local model to rapidly approach the global optimum. The second step uses component-wise active contours to discriminatively refine the subtle shape variation. Our framework can simultaneously handle face detection, pose-free landmark localization and tracking in real time. Extensive experiments are conducted on both laboratory environmental face databases and face-in-the-wild databases. All results demonstrate that our approach has certain advantages over state-of-theart methods in handling pose variations1.</p><p>3 0.90155703 <a title="70-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Exemplar-Based_Graph_Matching_for_Robust_Facial_Landmark_Localization.html">149 iccv-2013-Exemplar-Based Graph Matching for Robust Facial Landmark Localization</a></p>

<p>Author: Xavier P. Burgos-Artizzu, Pietro Perona, Piotr Dollár</p><p>Abstract: Human faces captured in real-world conditions present large variations in shape and occlusions due to differences in pose, expression, use of accessories such as sunglasses and hats and interactions with objects (e.g. food). Current face landmark estimation approaches struggle under such conditions since theyfail toprovide aprincipled way ofhandling outliers. We propose a novel method, called Robust Cascaded Pose Regression (RCPR) which reduces exposure to outliers by detecting occlusions explicitly and using robust shape-indexed features. We show that RCPR improves on previous landmark estimation methods on three popular face datasets (LFPW, LFW and HELEN). We further explore RCPR ’s performance by introducing a novel face dataset focused on occlusion, composed of 1,007 faces presenting a wide range of occlusion patterns. RCPR reduces failure cases by half on all four datasets, at the same time as it detects face occlusions with a 80/40% precision/recall.</p><p>6 0.785945 <a title="70-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Sieving_Regression_Forest_Votes_for_Facial_Feature_Detection_in_the_Wild.html">391 iccv-2013-Sieving Regression Forest Votes for Facial Feature Detection in the Wild</a></p>

<p>Author: Xu Wang, Stefan Atev, John Wright, Gilad Lerman</p><p>Abstract: The problem of efficiently deciding which of a database of models is most similar to a given input query arises throughout modern computer vision. Motivated by applications in recognition, image retrieval and optimization, there has been significant recent interest in the variant of this problem in which the database models are linear subspaces and the input is either a point or a subspace. Current approaches to this problem have poor scaling in high dimensions, and may not guarantee sublinear query complexity. We present a new approach to approximate nearest subspace search, based on a simple, new locality sensitive hash for subspaces. Our approach allows point-tosubspace query for a database of subspaces of arbitrary dimension d, in a time that depends sublinearly on the number of subspaces in the database. The query complexity of our algorithm is linear in the ambient dimension D, allow- ing it to be directly applied to high-dimensional imagery data. Numerical experiments on model problems in image repatching and automatic face recognition confirm the advantages of our algorithm in terms of both speed and accuracy.</p><p>2 0.97176325 <a title="70-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Coupled_Dictionary_and_Feature_Space_Learning_with_Applications_to_Cross-Domain_Image_Synthesis_and_Recognition.html">96 iccv-2013-Coupled Dictionary and Feature Space Learning with Applications to Cross-Domain Image Synthesis and Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: De-An Huang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p><p>Abstract: Cross-domain image synthesis and recognition are typically considered as two distinct tasks in the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition. Therefore, it is not clear whether approaches addressing one task can be easily generalized or extended for solving the other. In this paper, we propose a unified model for coupled dictionary and feature space learning. The proposed learning model not only observes a common feature space for associating cross-domain image data for recognition purposes, the derived feature space is able to jointly update the dictionaries in each image domain for improved representation. This is why our method can be applied to both cross-domain image synthesis and recognition problems. Experiments on a variety of synthesis and recognition tasks such as single image super-resolution, cross-view action recognition, and sketchto-photo face recognition would verify the effectiveness of our proposed learning model.</p><p>3 0.97067207 <a title="70-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Toward_Guaranteed_Illumination_Models_for_Non-convex_Objects.html">422 iccv-2013-Toward Guaranteed Illumination Models for Non-convex Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuqian Zhang, Cun Mu, Han-Wen Kuo, John Wright</p><p>Abstract: Illumination variation remains a central challenge in object detection and recognition. Existing analyses of illumination variation typically pertain to convex, Lambertian objects, and guarantee quality of approximation in an average case sense. We show that it is possible to build models for the set of images across illumination variation with worstcase performance guarantees, for nonconvex Lambertian objects. Namely, a natural verification test based on the distance to the model guarantees to accept any image which can be sufficiently well-approximated by an image of the object under some admissible lighting condition, and guarantees to reject any image that does not have a sufficiently good approximation. These models are generated by sampling illumination directions with sufficient density, which follows from a new perturbation bound for directional illuminated images in the Lambertian model. As the number of such images required for guaranteed verification may be large, we introduce a new formulation for cone preserving dimensionality reduction, which leverages tools from sparse and low-rank decomposition to reduce the complexity, while controlling the approximation error with respect to the original model. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.96769267 <a title="70-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Cascaded_Shape_Space_Pruning_for_Robust_Facial_Landmark_Detection.html">70 iccv-2013-Cascaded Shape Space Pruning for Robust Facial Landmark Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Mustafa Ayazoglu, Burak Yilmaz, Mario Sznaier, Octavia Camps</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of detecting causal interactions in video clips. Specifically, the goal is to detect whether the actions of a given target can be explained in terms of the past actions of a collection of other agents. We propose to solve this problem by recasting it into a directed graph topology identification, where each node corresponds to the observed motion of a given target, and each link indicates the presence of a causal correlation. As shown in the paper, this leads to a block-sparsification problem that can be efficiently solved using a modified Group-Lasso type approach, capable of handling missing data and outliers (due for instance to occlusion and mis-identified correspondences). Moreover, this approach also identifies time instants where the interactions between agents change, thus providing event detection capabilities. These results are illustrated with several examples involving non–trivial interactions amongst several human subjects. 1. Introduction and Motivation The problem of identifying causal interactions amongst targets in a video sequence has been the focus of considerable attention in the past few years. A large portion of the existing body of work in this field uses human annotated video to build a storyline that includes both recognizing the activities involved and the causal relationships between them (see for instance [10] and references therein). While these methods are powerful and work well when suitably annotated data is available, annotating video clips is expensive and parsing relevant actions requires domain knowledge which may not be readily available. Indeed, in many situations, unveiling potentially hidden causal relationships is a first step towards building such knowledge. In this paper we consider the problem of identifying causal interactions amongst targets, not necessarily human, ∗This work was supported by NSF grants IIS–0713003, IIS-1318145, and ECCS–0901433, AFOSR grant FA9559–12–1–0271, and the Alert DHS Center of Excellence under Award Number 2008-ST-061-ED0001 . from unannotated video sequences and without prior domain knowledge. Our approach exploits the concept of “Granger Causality” [9], that formalizes the intuitive idea that ifa time series {x(t)} is causally related to a second one {thya(tt)if}a, ttihmene knowledge }oifs tchaeu past vrealluateesd otfo a{yse}c1to should l{eya(dt t}o, a ebnett kern prediction o thf efu ptuasret vvaalulueess ooff {{yx}}tt+k. In [l1ea4d], Pora ab bheatktearr eprt.e aicl.t successfully vuasleude a frequency domain reformulation of this concept to uncover pairwise interactions in scenarios involving repeating events, such as social games. This technique was later extended in [17] to model causal correlations between human joints and applied to the problem of activity classification. However, since this approach is based upon estimating the crosscovariance density function between events, it cannot handle situations where these events are non repeating, are too rare to provide an accurate estimate, or where these estimates are biased by outliers or missing data. Further, estimating a pairwise measure of causal correlation requires a spectral factorization of the cross-covariance, followed by numerical integration and statistical thresholding, limiting the approach to moderately large problems. To circumvent these problems, in this paper we propose an alternative approach based upon recasting the problem into that of identifying the topology of a sparse (directed) graph, where each node corresponds to the time traces of relevant features of a target, and each link corresponds to a regressor. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 1 using as an example the problem of finding causal relations amongst 4 tennis players, leading to a graph with 4 nodes, and potentially 12 (directed) links. Note that in general, the problem of identifying causal relationships is ill posed (unless one wants to identify the set of all individuals that could possibly have causal connections), due to the existence of secondary interactions. To illustrate this point, consider a very simplistic scenario with three actors A, B, and C, where A copies (with some delay) the actions of B, which in turn mimics C, also with some delay. In this situation, the ac- tions of A can be explained in terms of either those of B delayed one time sample, or those of C delayed by two samples. Thus, an algorithm based upon a statistical analysis 33556758 would identify a causal connection between A and C, even though there is no direct link between them. Further, if the actions of C can be explained by some simple autoregressive model of the form: = C(t) ?aiC(t − i) then it follows that the acti?ons of A can be explained by the same model, e.g. = A(t) ?aiA(t − i) Hence, multiple graphs topologies, some of which include self-loops, can explain the same set of time-series. On the other hand, note that in this situation, the sparsest graph (in the sense of having the fewest links) is the one that correctly captures the causality relations: the most direct cause of A is B and that of B is C, with C potentially being explained by a self-loop. To capture this feature and regularize the problem, in the sequel we will seek to find the sparsest graph, in the sense of having the least number of interconnections, that explains the observed data, reflecting the fact that, when alternative models are possible, often the most parsimonious is the correct one. Our main result shows that the problem of identifying sparse graph structures from observed noisy data can be reduced to a convex optimization problem (via the use of Group Lasso type arguments) that can be efficiently solved.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we provide a formal reformulation of the problem of finding causal relationships between agents as a sparse graph identification problem. In section 3, we show that this problem can be efficiently solved using a re-weighted Group Lasso approach. Moreover, as shown there, the resulting problem can be solved one node at a time using first order methods, which allows for handling situations involving a large number of agents. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated in section 4 using both simple scenarios (for which ground truth is readily available) and video clips of sports, involving complex, nonrepeating interactions amongst many agents.

Consider a scenario with P moving agents, and denote by the 3D homogenous coordinates of the pth individual at time t. Motivated by the idea of Granger Causality, we will say that the actions of this agent depend causally from those in a set Ip (which can possibly contain p itself), if can be written as: Q˜p(t) Q˜p(t) Q˜p(t) ?N = ? ?ajp(n)Q˜j(t − n) +˜ η p(t) +˜ u p(t) (1) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 Here ajp are unknown coefficients, and ˜η p(t) and up(t) represent measurement noise and a piecewise constant signal that is intended to account for relatively rare events that cannot be explained by the (past) actions of other agents. Examples include interactions of an agent with the environment, for instance to avoid obstacles, or changes in the interactions between agents. Since these events are infrequent, we will model as a signal that has (component-wise) a sparse derivative. Note in passing that since (1) involves homogeneous coordinates, the coefficients aj,p(.) satisfy the following constraint1 u ?N ? ?ajp(n) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 =1 (2) Our goal is to identify causal relationships using as data 2D measurements qp(t) in F frames of the affine projections of the 3D coordinates Q˜p(t) of the targets. Note that, under the affine camera assumption, the 2D coordinates are related exactly by the same regressor parameters [2]. Thus, (1) holds if and only if: ?N qp(t) = ? ?ajp(n)qj(t − n) + u˜ p(t) + ηp(t) (3) j?∈Ip ?n=0 In this context, the problem can be precisely stated as: Given qp(t) (in F number of frames) and some a-priori bound N on the order of the regressors (that is the “memory” of the interactions), find the sparsest set of equations of the form (3) that explains the data, that is: aj,pm,ηinp,up?nIp (4) subject to? ?(2) and: = ? ?ajp(n)qj(t − n) + ?N qp(t) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 up(t) + ηp(t) , p = 1 . . . , P and t = 1, ..F 1This follows by considering the third coordinate in (1) (5) where nIp denotes the cardinality of the set Ip.

For instance, [1] proposed a Lasso type algorithm to identify a sparse network where each link corresponds to a VAR process. The main idea underlying this method is to exploit the fact that penalizing the ?1 norm of the vector of regression coefficients tends to produce sparse solutions. However, enforcing sparsity of the entire vector of regressor coefficients does not necessarily result in a sparse graph structure, since the resulting solution can consist of many links, each with a few coefficients. This difficulty can be circumvented by resorting to group Lasso type approaches [18], which seek to enforce block sparsity by using a combination of ?1 and ?2 norm constraints on the coefficients of the regressor. While this approach was shown to work well with artificial data in [11], exact recovery of the underlying network can be only guaranteed when the data satisfies suitable “incoherence” type conditions [4]. Finally, a different approach was pursued in [13], based on the use of a modified Orthogonal Least Squares algorithm, Cyclic Orthogonal Least Squares. However, this approach requires enforcing an a-priori limit on the number of links allowed to point to a single node, and such information may not be readily available, specially in cases where this number has high variability amongst nodes. To address these difficulties, in the next section we develop a convex optimization based approach to the problem of identifying sparse graph structures from observed noisy data. This method is closest in spirit to that in [11], in the sense that it is also based on a group Lasso type argument. The main differences consist in the ability to handle the unknown inputs up(t), needed to model exogenous disturbances affecting the agents, and in a reformulation of the problem, that allows for using a re-weighted iterative type algorithm, leading to substantially sparser solutions, even when the conditions in [4] fail. 3. Causality Identification Algorithm In this section we present the main result of this paper, an algorithm to search for block-sparse solutions to (7). For each fixed p, the algorithm searches for sparse solutions to (6) by solving (iteratively) the following problem (suggested by the re-weighted heuristic proposed in [7]) ?P ap,muxipn,uypi?=1wja(?aip?2) + λ??diag(wu)[Δuxp;Δuyp]??1 subject to: ?ηp ? ≤ p = 1, . . , P. ∞ ?P ?, ?N ??aip(n) i?= ?1 ?n=0 ?. = 1, p = 1,...,P. (9) where [Δuxp ; Δuyp] represents the first order differences of the exogenous input vector [uxp ; uyp], Wa and Wu are weighting matrices, and λ is a Lagrange multiplier that plays the role of a tuning parameter between graph sparsity and event sensitivity. Intuitively, for a fixed set of weights w, the algorithm attempts to find a block sparse solution to (6) and a set of sparse inp?uts Δuxp ; Δuyp , by exploiting the facts that minimizing ?i ?aip ?2 (the ?2,1 norm of the vector sequence {aip}) te?nds? tao m?aximize block-sparsity [18], while minimizing et?nhed s? 1t norm mmaizxeim blizoceks sparsity [ [1168]]. wOhniclee t mheisnesolutions are found, the weights w are adjusted to penalize those elements of the sequences with small values, so that in the next iteration solutions that set these elements to zero (hence further increasing sparsity) are favored. Note however, that proceeding in this way, requires solving at each iteration a problem with n = P(Pnr + F) variables, where P and F denote the number of agents and frames, respectively, and where nr is a bound on the regressor order. On the other hand, it is easily seen that both the objective function and the constraints in (9) can be partitioned into P groups, with the pth group involving only the variables related to the pth node. It follows then that problem (9) can be solved by solving P smaller problems of the form: ?P ap,muxipn,uypi?=1wja(?aip?2) + λ??diag(wu)[Δuxp;Δuyp]??1 ?P subject to: ?ηp?∞ ?N ≤ ? and ??aip(n) i?= ?1 ?n=0 leading to the algorithm given below: =1 (10) Algorithm 1: REWEIGHTEDCAUSALITYALGORITHM for each p wa = [1, 1, ..., 1] = [1, 1, ..., 1] S > 1(self loop weight) s = [1, 1, ..., S, ..., 1] (p’th element is S) while not converged do 1. solve (9) 2. wja = 1/( ?aip ?2 + δ) 3. wja = wja ◦ s (Penalization self loops) 4. = 1./(abs([Δuxp ; Δuyp]) + δ) end while 5. At this point ajp(.) , Ip and up(t) have been identified end for wu wu It is worth emphasizing that, since the computational complexity of standard interior point methods grows as n3, solving these smaller P problems leads to roughly a O(P2) 33557781 reduction in computational time over solving a single, larger optimization. Thus, this approach can handle moderately large problems using standard, interior-point based, semidefinite optimization solvers. Larger problems can be accommodated by noting that the special form of the objective and constraints allow for using iterative Augmented La- grangian Type Methods (ALM), based upon computing, at each step, the closed form solution to suitable intermediate optimization problems. While a complete derivation of such an algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper, using results from [12] it can be shown that each step requires only a combination of thresholding and least-squares approximations. Moreover, it can be shown that such an algorithm converges Q-superlinearly. 4. Handling Outliers and Missing Data The algorithm outlined above assumes an ideal situation where the data matrix B is perfectly known. However, in practice many of its elements may be outliers (due to misidentified correspondences) or missing (due to occlusion). As we briefly show next, these situations can be efficiently handled by performing a structured robust PCA step [3] to obtain a “clean” data matrix, prior to applying Algorithm 1. From equation (6) it follows that, in the absence of exogenous inputs and noise: ?xy11.. . .yxPP? = ?XY11.. . .YXPP? ?a1...aP? (11) Since xi ∈ {col(Xj)} and yi ∈ {col(Yj }), it follows that the sets {∈co {l(cXoli(X)} a)n}d a n{dco yl(Y∈i) { }c? are self-ex?pressive, or, ?equivalently?, Xthe }ma atnridce {sc oXl( =.) }? aXre1 . . . fX-eNxp? eanssdiv eY, ?Y1 ...YN? are mraantkri cdeesfic Xient. ?Consider no?w the case =.r, w?here some ?elements xi, yi of X and Y are missing.

Experimental Results In this section we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using several video clips (provided as supplemental material). The results of the experiments are displayed using graphs embedded on the video frames: An arrow indicates causal correlation between agents, with the point of the arrow indicating the agent whose actions are affected by the agent at its tail. The internal parameters of the algorithm were experimentally tuned, leading to the values ? = 0.1, = 0.05, self loop weights S = 10. The algorithm is fairly insensitive to the value of the regularization parameters and S, which could be adjusted up or down by an order of magnitude without affecting the structure of the resulting graph. Finally, we used regressor order N=2 for the first three examples and N=4 for the last one, a choice that is consistent with the frame rate and the complexity of λ λ the actions taking place in each clip. 5.1. Clips from the UT-Interaction Data Set We considered two video clips from the UT Human Interaction Data Set [15] (sequences 6 and 16). Figures 2 and 5 compare the results obtained applying the proposed algorithm versus Group Lasso (GL) [11] and Group Lasso combined with the reweighted heuristic described in (9) (GLRW). In all cases, the inputs to the algorithm were the (approximate) coordinates of the heads of each of the agents, normalized to the interval [−1, 1], artificially corrupted ,w niothrm m10al%iz eodut tloie trhs.e Notably, [t−he1 proposed algorithm 2As shown in [6, 8] under suitable conditions these relaxations the exact minimum rank solution. 33557792 recover Figure 2.

Only the proposed method identifies the correct connections. was able to correctly identify the correlations between the agents from this very limited amount of information, while the others failed to do so. Note in passing that in both cases none of the algorithms were directly applicable, due to some of the individuals leaving the field of view or being occluded. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the missing data was recovered by solving an RPCA problem prior to applying Algorithm 1. Finally, Fig. 4 sheds more insight on the key role played by the sparse signal u. As shown there, changes in u correspond exactly to time instants when the behavior of the corresponding agent deviates from the general pattern followed during most of the clip. Figure 3. Time traces of the individual heads in the UT sequence 6, artificially corrupted with 10 % outliers. The outliers were removed and the missing data due to targets leaving the field of view was estimated solving a modified RPCA problem. Frame number Figure 4.

Doubles Tennis Experiment This experiment considers a non-staged real-life scenario. The data consists of 230 frames of a video clip from the Australian Open Tennis Doubles Final games. The goal here is to identify causal relationships between the different players using time traces of the respective centroid positions. Note that in this case the ground truth is not available. Nevertheless, since players from the same team usually look at their opponents and react to their motions, we expect a strong causality connection between members of 33557803 opposite teams. This intuition is matched by the correlations unveiled by the algorithm, shown in Fig. 6. The identified sparse input corresponding to the vertical direction is shown in Fig. 7 (similar results for the horizontal component are omitted due to space reasons.) Figure 6. Sample frames from the tennis sequence. Top: The proposed method correctly identifies interactions between opposite team members. Center: Reweighted Group Lasso misses the interaction between the two rear-most individuals of opposite teams, generating self loops instead (denoted by the disks). Bottom: Group Lasso yields an almost complete graph. Figure 7. Exogenous signal corresponding to the vertical axis for the tennis sequence. The change in one component corresponds to the instant when the leftmost player in the bottom team moves from the line towards the net, remaining closer to it from then on. 5.3. Basketball Game Experiment This experiment considers the interactions amongst players in a basketball game. As in the case ofthe tennis players, since the data comes from a real life scenario, the ground truth is not available. However, contrary to the tennis game, this scenario involves complex interactions amongst many players, and causality is hard to discern by inspection. Nevertheless, the results shown in Fig. 8, obtained using the position of the centroids as inputs to our algorithm, match our intuition. Firstly, one would expect a strong cause/effect connection between the actions of the player with the ball and the two defending opponents facing him. These connections (denoted by the yellow arrows) were indeed successfully identified by the algorithm. The next set of causal correlations is represented by the (blue, light green) and (black, white) arrow pairs showing the defending and the opponent players on the far side of the field and under the hoop. An important, counterintuitive, connection identified by the algorithm is represented by the magenta arrows be- tween the right winger of the white team with two of his teammates: the one holding the ball and the one running behind all players. While at first sight this connection is not as obvious as the others, it becomes apparent towards the end of the sequence, when the right winger player is signaling with a raised arm. Notably, our algorithm was able to unveil this signaling without the need to perform a semantic analysis (a very difficult task here, since this signaling is apparent only in the last few frames). Rather, it used the fact that the causal correlation was encapsulated in the dynamics of the relative motions of these players. 6. Conclusions In this paper we propose a new method for detecting causal interactions between agents using video data. The main idea is to recast this problem into a blind directed graph topology identification, where each node corresponds to the observed motion of a given target, each link indicates the presence of a causal correlation and the unknown inputs account for changes in the interaction patterns. In turn, this problem can be reduced to that of finding block-sparse solutions to a set of linear equations, which can be efficiently accomplished using an iterative re-weighted Group-Lasso approach. The ability of the algorithm to correctly identify causal correlations, even in cases where portions of the data record are missing or corrupted by outliers, and the key role played by the unknown exogenous input were illustrated with several examples involving non–trivial inter- actions amongst several human subjects. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm was able to identify both the correct interactions and the time instants when interactions amongst agents changed, based on minimal motion information: in all cases we used just a single time trace per person. This success indicates that in many scenarios, the dynamic information contained in the motion pattern of a single feature associated with a target is rich enough to enable identifying complex interaction patterns, without the need to track multiple features, perform a semantic analysis or use additional domain knowledge. 33557814 Figure 8.

<p>Author: Yu Li, Michael S. Brown</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an automatic method for removing reflection interference when imaging a scene behind a glass surface. Our approach exploits the subtle changes in the reflection with respect to the background in a small set of images taken at slightly different view points. Key to this idea is the use of SIFT-flow to align the images such that a pixel-wise comparison can be made across the input set. Gradients with variation across the image set are assumed to belong to the reflected scenes while constant gradients are assumed to belong to the desired background scene. By correctly labelling gradients belonging to reflection or background, the background scene can be separated from the reflection interference. Unlike previous approaches that exploit motion, our approach does not make any assumptions regarding the background or reflected scenes’ geometry, nor requires the reflection to be static. This makes our approach practical for use in casual imaging scenarios. Our approach is straight forward and produces good results compared with existing methods. 1. Introduction and Related Work There are situations when a scene must be imaged behind a pane of glass. This is common when “window shopping” where one takes a photograph of an object behind a window. This is not a conducive setup for imaging as the glass will produce an unwanted layer of reflection in the resulting image. This problem can be treated as one of layer separation [7, 8], where the captured image I a linear combiis nation of a reflection layer IR and the desired background scene, IB, as follows: I IR + IB. = (1) The goal of reflection removal is to separate IB and IR from an input image I shown in Figure 1. as This problem is ill-posed, as it requires extracting two layers from one image. To make the problem tractable additional information, either supplied from the user or from Fig. 1. Example of our approach separating the background (IB) and reflection (IR) layers of one of the input images. Note that the reflection layer’s contrast has been boosted to improve visualization. multiple images, is required. For example, Levin and Weiss [7, 8] proposed a method where a user labelled image gradients as belonging to either background or reflection. Combing the markup with an optimization that imposed a sparsity prior on the separated images, their method produced compelling results. The only drawback was the need for user intervention. An automatic method was proposed by Levin et al. [9] that found the most likely decomposition which minimized the total number of edges and corners in the recovered image using a database of natural images. As 22443322 with example-based methods, the results were reliant on the similarity of the examples in the database. Another common strategy is to use multiple images. Some methods assume a fixed camera that is able to capture a set of images with different mixing of the layers through various means, e.g. rotating a polarized lens [3, 6, 12, 16, 17], changing focus [15], or applying a flash [1]. While these approaches demonstrate good results, the ability of controlling focal change, polarization, and flash may not always be possible. Sarel and Irani [13, 14] proposed video based methods that work by assuming the two layers, reflection and background, to be statistically uncorrelated. These methods can handle complex geometry in the reflection layer, but require a long image sequence such that the reflection layer has significant changes in order for a median-based approach [21] to extract the intrinsic image from the sequence as the initial guess for one of the layers. Techniques closer to ours exploit motion between the layers present in multiple images. In particular, when the background is captured from different points of view, the background and the reflection layers undergo different motions due to their different distance to the transparent layer. One issue with changing viewpoint is handling alignment among the images. Szeliski et al. [19] proposed a method that could simultaneously recover the two layers by assuming they were both static scenes and related by parametric transformations (i.e. homographies). Gai et al. [4, 5] proposed a similar approach that aligned the images in the gradient domain using gradient sparsity, again assuming static scenes. Tsin et al. [20] relaxed the planar scene constraint in [19] and used dense stereo correspondence with stereo matching configuration which limits the camera motion to unidirectional parallel motion. These approaches produce good results, but the constraint on scene geometry and assumed motion of the camera limit the type of scenes that can be processed. Our Contribution Our proposed method builds on the single-image approach by Levin and Weiss [8], but removes the need for user markup by examining the relative motion in a small set (e.g. 3-5) of images to automatically label gradients as either reflection or background. This is done by first aligning the images using SIFT-flow and then examining the variation in the gradients over the image set. Gradients with more variation are assumed to be from reflection while constant gradients are assumed to be from the desired background. While a simple idea, this approach does not impose any restrictions on the scene or reflection geometry. This allows a more practical imaging setup that is suitable for handheld cameras. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 overviews our approach; section 3 compares our results with prior methods on several examples; the paper is concluded in section 4. Warped ? ?Recovered ? ? Recovered ? ? Warp e d ? ?Recover d ? ? Recover d ? ? Fig. 2. This figure shows the separated layers of the first two input images. The layers illustrate that the background image IB has lit- tle variation while the reflection layers, IRi ,have notable variation due to the viewpoint change. 2. Reflection Removal Method 2.1. Imaging Assumption and Procedure The input ofour approach is a small set of k images taken of the scene from slightly varying view points. We assume the background dominates in the mixture image and the images are related by a warping, such that the background is registered and the reflection layer is changing. This relationship can be expressed as: Ii = wi(IRi + IB), (2) where Ii is the i-th mixture image, {wi}, i = 1, . . . , k are warping fuisn tchteio in-sth hcma uisxetud by mthaeg camera viewpoint change with respect to a reference image (in our case I1). Assuming we can estimate the inverse warps, w−i1, where w−11 is the identity, we get the following relationship: wi−1(Ii) = IRi + IB. (3) Even though IB appears static in the mixture image, the problem is still ill-posed given we have more unknowns than the number of input images. However, the presence of a static IB in the image set makes it possible to identify gradient edges of the background layer IB and edges of the changing reflection layers IRi . More specifically, edges in IB are assumed to appear every time in the image set while the edges in the reflection layer IRi are assumed to vary across the set. This reflection-change effect can be seen in Figure 2. This means edges can be labelled based on the frequency of a gradient appearing at a particular pixel across the aligned input images. After labelling edges as either background or reflection, we can reconstruct the two layers using an optimization that imposes the sparsity prior on the separated layers as done by [7, 8]. Figure 3 shows the processing pipeline of our approach. Each step is described in the following sections. 22443333 Fig. 3. This figure shows the pipeline of our approach: 1) warping functions are estimated to align the inputs to a reference view; 2) the edges are labelled as either background or foreground based on gradient frequency; 3) a reconstruction step is used to separate the two layers; 4) all recovered background layers are combined together to get the final recovered background. 2.2. Warping Our approach begins by estimating warping functions, w−i1, to register the input to the reference image. Previous approaches estimated these warps using global parametric motion (e.g. homographies [4, 5, 19]), however, the planarity constraint often leads to regions in the image with misalignments when the scene is not planar. Traditional dense correspondence method like optical flow is another option. However, even with our assumption that the background should be more prominent than the reflection layer, optical flow methods (e.g. [2, 18]) that are based on image intensity gave poor performance due to the reflection interference. This led us to try SIFT-flow [10] that is based on more robust image features. SIFT-flow [10] proved to work surprisingly well on our input sequences and provide a dense warp suitable to bring the images into alignment even under moderate interference of reflection. Empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of SIFT-flow in this task as well as the comparison with optical flow are shown in our supplemental materials. Our implementation fixes I1 as the reference, then uses SIFT-flow to estimate the inverse-warping functions {w−i1 }, i= 2, . . . , k for each ofthe input images I2 , . . . , Ik against ,I 1i . = W 2e, a.l.s.o, compute htohef gradient magnitudes Gi of the each input image and then warp the images Ii as well as the gradient magnitudes Gi using the same inverse-warping function w−i1, denoting the warped images and gradient magnitudes as Iˆi and Gˆi. 2.3. Edge separation Our approach first identifies salient edges using a simple threshold on the gradient magnitudes in Gˆi. The resulting binary edge map is denoted as Ei. After edge detection, the edges need to be separated as either background or foreground in each aligned image Iˆi. As previously discussed, the edges of the background layer should appear frequently across all the warped images while the edges of the reflection layer would only have sparse presence. To examine the sparsity of the edge occurrence, we use the following measurement: Φ(y) =??yy??2221, (4) where y is a vector containing the gradient magnitudes at a given pixel location. Since all elements in y are non-negative, we can rewrite equation 4 as Φ(y) = yi)2. This measurement can be conside?red as a L1? normalized L2 norm. It measures the sparsity o?f the vecto?r which achieves its maximum value of 1when only one non-zero item exists and achieve its minimum value of k1 when all items are non-zero and have identical values (i.e. y1 = y2 = . . . = yk > 0). This measurement is used to assign two probabilities to each edge pixel as belonging to either background or reflection. We estimate the reflection edge probability by examining ?ik=1 yi2/(?ik=1 22443344 the edge occurrence, as follows: PRi(x) = s?(??iikk==11GGˆˆii((xx))2)2−k1?,(5) Gˆi Iˆi. where, (x) is the gradient magnitude at pixel x of We subtract k1 to move the smallest value close to zero. The sparsity measurement is further stretched by a sigmoid function s(t) = (1 + e−(t−0.05)/0.05)−1 to facilitate the separation. The background edge probability is then estimated by: PBi(x) = s?−?(??iikk==11GGˆˆii((xx))2)2−k1??,(6) where PBi (x) + PRi (x) = ?1. These probabilities are defined only at the pixels that are edges in the image. We consider only edge pixels with relatively high probability in either the background edge probability map or reflection edge probability map. The final edge separation is performed by thresholding the two probability maps as: EBi/Ri(x) =⎨⎧ 10, Ei(x) = 1 aotndhe PrwBiis/eRi(x) > 0.6 Figure 4 shows ⎩the edge separation procedure. 2.4. Layer Reconstruction With the separated edges of the background and the reflection, we can reconstruct the two layers. Levin and Weis- ???????????? Gˆ Fig. 4. Edge separation illustration: 1) shows the all gradient maps in this case we have five input images; 2) plots the gradient values at two position across the five images - top plot is a pixel on a background edge, bottom plot is a pixel on a reflection edge; 3) shows the probability map estimated for each layer; 4) Final edge separation after thresholding the probability maps. s [7, 8] showed that the long tailed distribution of gradients in natural scenes is an effective prior in this problem. This kind of distributions is well modelled by a Laplacian or hyper-Laplacian distribution (P(t) ∝ p = 1for – e−|t|p/s, Laplacian and p < 1 for hyper-Laplacian). In our work, we use Laplacian approximation since the L1 norm converges quickly with good results. For each image Iˆi , we try to maximize the probability P(IBi , IRi ) in order to separate the two layers and this is equivalent to minimizing the cost log P(IBi , IRi ). Following the same deduction tinh e[ c7]o,s tw −ithlo tgheP independent assumption of the two layers (i.e. P(IBi , IRi ) = P(IBi ) · P(IRi )), the objective function becomes: − J(IBi) = ? |(IBi ∗ fn)(x)| + |((Iˆi − IBi) ∗ fn)(x)| ?x, ?n + λ?EBi(x)|((Iˆi − IBi) ∗ fn)(x)| ?x, ?n + λ?ERi(x)|(IBi ?x,n ∗ fn)(x)|, (7) where fn denotes the derivative filters and ∗ is the 2D convolution operator. hFeo rd efrniv, we use trwso a nodri e∗n istat tihoen 2s Dan cdo nt-wo degrees (first order and second order) derivative filters. While the first term in the objective function keeps the gradients of the two layer as sparse as possible, the last two terms force the gradients of IBi at edges positions in EBi to agree with the gradients of input image Iˆi and gradients of IRi at edge positions in ERi agree with the gradients of Iˆi. This equation can be further rewritten in the form of J = ?Au b? 1 and be minimized efficiently using iterative − reweighted lbea?st square [11]. 2.5. Combining the Results Our approach processes each image in the input set independently. Due to the reflective glass surface, some of the images may contain saturated regions from specular highlights. When saturation occurs, we can not fully recover the structure in these saturated regions because the information about the two layers are lost. In addition, sometimes the edges of the reflection in some regions are too weak to be correctly distinguished. This can lead to local regions in the background where the reflection is still present. These erroneous regions are often in different places in each input image due to changes in the reflection. In such cases, it is reasonable to assume that the minimum value across all recovered background layers may be a proper approximation of the true background. As such, the last step of our method is to take the minimum of the pixel value of all reconstructed background images as the final recovered background, as follows: IB (x) = mini IBi (x) . 22443355 (8) Fig. 5. This figure shows our combination procedure. The recovered background on each single image is good at first glance but may have reflection remaining in local regions. A simple minimum operator combining all recovered images gives a better result in these regions. The comparison can be seen in the zoomed-in regions. × Based on this, the reflection layer of each input image can be computed by IRi = IB . The effectiveness of this combination procedure is ill−us Itrated in Figure 5. Iˆi − 3. Results In this section, we present the experimental results of our proposed method. Additional results and test cases can be found in the accompanying supplemental materials. The experiments were conducted on an Intel i7? PC (3.4GHz CPU, 8.0GB RAM). The code was implemented in Matlab. We use the SIFT-Flow implementation provided by the authors 1. Matlab code and images used in our paper can be downloaded at the author’s webpage 2. The entire procedure outlined in Figure 3 takes approximately five minutes for a 500 400 image sequence containing up to five images.

Figure 6 shows two examples of our edge separation results and final reconstructed background layers and reflection layers. Our method provides a clear separation of the edges of the two layers which is crucial in the reconstruc- 1http://people.csail.mit.edu/celiu/SIFTflow/SIFTflow.zip 2http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/ liyu1988/ tion step. Figure 9 shows more reflection removal results of our method. We also compare our methods with those in [8] and [5]. For the method in [8], we use the source code 3 of the author to generate the results. The comparisons between our and [8] are not entirely fair since [8] uses single image to generate the result, while we have the advantage of the entire set. For the results produced by [8], the reference view was used as input. The required user-markup is also provided. For the method in [5], we set the layer number to be one, and estimate the motions of the background layer using their method. In the reconstruction phase, we set the remaining reflection layer in k input mixture images as k different layers, each only appearing once in one mixture. Figure 8 shows the results of two examples. Our results are arguably the best. The results of [8] still exhibited some edges from different layers even with the elaborate user mark-ups. This may be fixed by going back to further refine the user markup. But in the heavily overlapping edge regions, it is challenging for users to indicate the edges. If the edges are not clearly indicated the results tend to be over smoothed in one layer. For the method of [5], since it uses global transformations to align images, local misalignment effects often appear in the final recovered background image. Also, their approach uses all the input image into the optimization to recover the layers. This may lead to the result that has edges from different reflection layers of different images mixed and appear as ghosting effect in the recovered background image. For heavily saturated regions, none of the two previous methods can give visually plausible results like ours. 4. Discussion and Conclusion We have presented a method to automatically remove reflectance interference due to a glass surface. Our approach works by capturing a set of images of a scene from slightly varying view points. The images are then aligned and edges are labelled as belonging to either background or reflectance. This alignment was enabled by SIFT-flow, whose robustness to the reflection interference enabled our method. When using SIFT-flow, we assume that the background layer will be the most prominent and will provide sufficient SIFT features for matching. While we found this to work well in practice, images with very strong reflectance can produce poor alignment as SIFT-flow may attempt to align to the foreground which is changing. This will cause problems in the subsequent layer separation. Figure 7 shows such a case. While these failures can often be handled by cropping the image or simple user input (see supplemental material), it is a notable issue. Another challenging issue is when the background scene 3http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/ levina/papers/reflections.zip 22443366 ??? ??? ?? ??? Fig. 6. Example of edge separation results and recovered background and foreground layer using our method has large homogeneous regions. In such cases there are no edges to be labelled as background. This makes subsequent separation challenging, especially when the reflection interference in these regions is weak but still visually noticeable. While this problem is not unique to our approach, it is an issue to consider. We also found that by combining all the background results of the input images we can overcome Fig. 7. A failure case of our approach due to dominant reflection against the background in some regions (i.e. the upper part of the phonograph). This will cause unsatisfactory alignment of the background in the warping procedure which further lead to our edge separation and final reconstruction failure as can be seen in the figure. local regions with high saturation. While a simple idea, this combination strategy can be incorporated into other techniques to improve their results. Lastly, we believe reflection removal is an application that would be welcomed on many mobile devices, however, the current processing time is still too long for real world use. Exploring ways to speed up the processing pipeline is an area of interest for future work. Acknowledgement This work was supported by Singapore A*STAR PSF grant 11212100. References [1] A. K.

<p>Author: Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new Deep Decompositional Network (DDN) for parsing pedestrian images into semantic regions, such as hair, head, body, arms, and legs, where the pedestrians can be heavily occluded. Unlike existing methods based on template matching or Bayesian inference, our approach directly maps low-level visual features to the label maps of body parts with DDN, which is able to accurately estimate complex pose variations with good robustness to occlusions and background clutters. DDN jointly estimates occluded regions and segments body parts by stacking three types of hidden layers: occlusion estimation layers, completion layers, and decomposition layers. The occlusion estimation layers estimate a binary mask, indicating which part of a pedestrian is invisible. The completion layers synthesize low-level features of the invisible part from the original features and the occlusion mask. The decomposition layers directly transform the synthesized visual features to label maps. We devise a new strategy to pre-train these hidden layers, and then fine-tune the entire network using the stochastic gradient descent. Experimental results show that our approach achieves better segmentation accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods on pedestrian images with or without occlusions. Another important contribution of this paper is that it provides a large scale benchmark human parsing dataset1 that includes 3, 673 annotated samples collected from 171 surveillance videos. It is 20 times larger than existing public datasets.</p><p>4 0.16538388 <a title="420-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Deep_Learning_for_Pedestrian_Detection.html">220 iccv-2013-Joint Deep Learning for Pedestrian Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Phillip Isola, Ce Liu</p><p>Abstract: To quickly synthesize complex scenes, digital artists often collage together visual elements from multiple sources: for example, mountainsfrom New Zealand behind a Scottish castle with wisps of Saharan sand in front. In this paper, we propose to use a similar process in order to parse a scene. We model a scene as a collage of warped, layered objects sampled from labeled, reference images. Each object is related to the rest by a set of support constraints. Scene parsing is achieved through analysis-by-synthesis. Starting with a dataset of labeled exemplar scenes, we retrieve a dictionary of candidate object segments thaOt miginaatl icmhag ea querEdyi eimd im-a age. We then combine elements of this set into a “scene collage ” that explains the query image. Beyond just assigning object labels to pixels, scene collaging produces a lot more information such as the number of each type of object in the scene, how they support one another, the ordinal depth of each object, and, to some degree, occluded content. We exploit this representation for several applications: image editing, random scene synthesis, and image-to-anaglyph.</p><p>6 0.15510759 <a title="420-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Piecewise_Rigid_Scene_Flow.html">317 iccv-2013-Piecewise Rigid Scene Flow</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu Li, Michael S. Brown</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an automatic method for removing reflection interference when imaging a scene behind a glass surface. Our approach exploits the subtle changes in the reflection with respect to the background in a small set of images taken at slightly different view points. Key to this idea is the use of SIFT-flow to align the images such that a pixel-wise comparison can be made across the input set. Gradients with variation across the image set are assumed to belong to the reflected scenes while constant gradients are assumed to belong to the desired background scene. By correctly labelling gradients belonging to reflection or background, the background scene can be separated from the reflection interference. Unlike previous approaches that exploit motion, our approach does not make any assumptions regarding the background or reflected scenes’ geometry, nor requires the reflection to be static. This makes our approach practical for use in casual imaging scenarios. Our approach is straight forward and produces good results compared with existing methods. 1. Introduction and Related Work There are situations when a scene must be imaged behind a pane of glass. This is common when “window shopping” where one takes a photograph of an object behind a window. This is not a conducive setup for imaging as the glass will produce an unwanted layer of reflection in the resulting image. This problem can be treated as one of layer separation [7, 8], where the captured image I a linear combiis nation of a reflection layer IR and the desired background scene, IB, as follows: I IR + IB. = (1) The goal of reflection removal is to separate IB and IR from an input image I shown in Figure 1. as This problem is ill-posed, as it requires extracting two layers from one image. To make the problem tractable additional information, either supplied from the user or from Fig. 1. Example of our approach separating the background (IB) and reflection (IR) layers of one of the input images. Note that the reflection layer’s contrast has been boosted to improve visualization. multiple images, is required. For example, Levin and Weiss [7, 8] proposed a method where a user labelled image gradients as belonging to either background or reflection. Combing the markup with an optimization that imposed a sparsity prior on the separated images, their method produced compelling results. The only drawback was the need for user intervention. An automatic method was proposed by Levin et al. [9] that found the most likely decomposition which minimized the total number of edges and corners in the recovered image using a database of natural images. As 22443322 with example-based methods, the results were reliant on the similarity of the examples in the database. Another common strategy is to use multiple images. Some methods assume a fixed camera that is able to capture a set of images with different mixing of the layers through various means, e.g. rotating a polarized lens [3, 6, 12, 16, 17], changing focus [15], or applying a flash [1]. While these approaches demonstrate good results, the ability of controlling focal change, polarization, and flash may not always be possible. Sarel and Irani [13, 14] proposed video based methods that work by assuming the two layers, reflection and background, to be statistically uncorrelated. These methods can handle complex geometry in the reflection layer, but require a long image sequence such that the reflection layer has significant changes in order for a median-based approach [21] to extract the intrinsic image from the sequence as the initial guess for one of the layers. Techniques closer to ours exploit motion between the layers present in multiple images. In particular, when the background is captured from different points of view, the background and the reflection layers undergo different motions due to their different distance to the transparent layer. One issue with changing viewpoint is handling alignment among the images. Szeliski et al. [19] proposed a method that could simultaneously recover the two layers by assuming they were both static scenes and related by parametric transformations (i.e. homographies). Gai et al. [4, 5] proposed a similar approach that aligned the images in the gradient domain using gradient sparsity, again assuming static scenes. Tsin et al. [20] relaxed the planar scene constraint in [19] and used dense stereo correspondence with stereo matching configuration which limits the camera motion to unidirectional parallel motion. These approaches produce good results, but the constraint on scene geometry and assumed motion of the camera limit the type of scenes that can be processed. Our Contribution Our proposed method builds on the single-image approach by Levin and Weiss [8], but removes the need for user markup by examining the relative motion in a small set (e.g. 3-5) of images to automatically label gradients as either reflection or background. This is done by first aligning the images using SIFT-flow and then examining the variation in the gradients over the image set. Gradients with more variation are assumed to be from reflection while constant gradients are assumed to be from the desired background. While a simple idea, this approach does not impose any restrictions on the scene or reflection geometry. This allows a more practical imaging setup that is suitable for handheld cameras. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 overviews our approach; section 3 compares our results with prior methods on several examples; the paper is concluded in section 4. Warped ? ?Recovered ? ? Recovered ? ? Warp e d ? ?Recover d ? ? Recover d ? ? Fig. 2. This figure shows the separated layers of the first two input images. The layers illustrate that the background image IB has lit- tle variation while the reflection layers, IRi ,have notable variation due to the viewpoint change. 2. Reflection Removal Method 2.1. Imaging Assumption and Procedure The input ofour approach is a small set of k images taken of the scene from slightly varying view points. We assume the background dominates in the mixture image and the images are related by a warping, such that the background is registered and the reflection layer is changing. This relationship can be expressed as: Ii = wi(IRi + IB), (2) where Ii is the i-th mixture image, {wi}, i = 1, . . . , k are warping fuisn tchteio in-sth hcma uisxetud by mthaeg camera viewpoint change with respect to a reference image (in our case I1). Assuming we can estimate the inverse warps, w−i1, where w−11 is the identity, we get the following relationship: wi−1(Ii) = IRi + IB. (3) Even though IB appears static in the mixture image, the problem is still ill-posed given we have more unknowns than the number of input images. However, the presence of a static IB in the image set makes it possible to identify gradient edges of the background layer IB and edges of the changing reflection layers IRi . More specifically, edges in IB are assumed to appear every time in the image set while the edges in the reflection layer IRi are assumed to vary across the set. This reflection-change effect can be seen in Figure 2. This means edges can be labelled based on the frequency of a gradient appearing at a particular pixel across the aligned input images. After labelling edges as either background or reflection, we can reconstruct the two layers using an optimization that imposes the sparsity prior on the separated layers as done by [7, 8]. Figure 3 shows the processing pipeline of our approach. Each step is described in the following sections. 22443333 Fig. 3. This figure shows the pipeline of our approach: 1) warping functions are estimated to align the inputs to a reference view; 2) the edges are labelled as either background or foreground based on gradient frequency; 3) a reconstruction step is used to separate the two layers; 4) all recovered background layers are combined together to get the final recovered background. 2.2. Warping Our approach begins by estimating warping functions, w−i1, to register the input to the reference image. Previous approaches estimated these warps using global parametric motion (e.g. homographies [4, 5, 19]), however, the planarity constraint often leads to regions in the image with misalignments when the scene is not planar. Traditional dense correspondence method like optical flow is another option. However, even with our assumption that the background should be more prominent than the reflection layer, optical flow methods (e.g. [2, 18]) that are based on image intensity gave poor performance due to the reflection interference. This led us to try SIFT-flow [10] that is based on more robust image features. SIFT-flow [10] proved to work surprisingly well on our input sequences and provide a dense warp suitable to bring the images into alignment even under moderate interference of reflection. Empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of SIFT-flow in this task as well as the comparison with optical flow are shown in our supplemental materials. Our implementation fixes I1 as the reference, then uses SIFT-flow to estimate the inverse-warping functions {w−i1 }, i= 2, . . . , k for each ofthe input images I2 , . . . , Ik against ,I 1i . = W 2e, a.l.s.o, compute htohef gradient magnitudes Gi of the each input image and then warp the images Ii as well as the gradient magnitudes Gi using the same inverse-warping function w−i1, denoting the warped images and gradient magnitudes as Iˆi and Gˆi. 2.3. Edge separation Our approach first identifies salient edges using a simple threshold on the gradient magnitudes in Gˆi. The resulting binary edge map is denoted as Ei. After edge detection, the edges need to be separated as either background or foreground in each aligned image Iˆi. As previously discussed, the edges of the background layer should appear frequently across all the warped images while the edges of the reflection layer would only have sparse presence. To examine the sparsity of the edge occurrence, we use the following measurement: Φ(y) =??yy??2221, (4) where y is a vector containing the gradient magnitudes at a given pixel location. Since all elements in y are non-negative, we can rewrite equation 4 as Φ(y) = yi)2. This measurement can be conside?red as a L1? normalized L2 norm. It measures the sparsity o?f the vecto?r which achieves its maximum value of 1when only one non-zero item exists and achieve its minimum value of k1 when all items are non-zero and have identical values (i.e. y1 = y2 = . . . = yk > 0). This measurement is used to assign two probabilities to each edge pixel as belonging to either background or reflection. We estimate the reflection edge probability by examining ?ik=1 yi2/(?ik=1 22443344 the edge occurrence, as follows: PRi(x) = s?(??iikk==11GGˆˆii((xx))2)2−k1?,(5) Gˆi Iˆi. where, (x) is the gradient magnitude at pixel x of We subtract k1 to move the smallest value close to zero. The sparsity measurement is further stretched by a sigmoid function s(t) = (1 + e−(t−0.05)/0.05)−1 to facilitate the separation. The background edge probability is then estimated by: PBi(x) = s?−?(??iikk==11GGˆˆii((xx))2)2−k1??,(6) where PBi (x) + PRi (x) = ?1. These probabilities are defined only at the pixels that are edges in the image. We consider only edge pixels with relatively high probability in either the background edge probability map or reflection edge probability map. The final edge separation is performed by thresholding the two probability maps as: EBi/Ri(x) =⎨⎧ 10, Ei(x) = 1 aotndhe PrwBiis/eRi(x) > 0.6 Figure 4 shows ⎩the edge separation procedure. 2.4. Layer Reconstruction With the separated edges of the background and the reflection, we can reconstruct the two layers. Levin and Weis- ???????????? Gˆ Fig. 4. Edge separation illustration: 1) shows the all gradient maps in this case we have five input images; 2) plots the gradient values at two position across the five images - top plot is a pixel on a background edge, bottom plot is a pixel on a reflection edge; 3) shows the probability map estimated for each layer; 4) Final edge separation after thresholding the probability maps. s [7, 8] showed that the long tailed distribution of gradients in natural scenes is an effective prior in this problem. This kind of distributions is well modelled by a Laplacian or hyper-Laplacian distribution (P(t) ∝ p = 1for – e−|t|p/s, Laplacian and p < 1 for hyper-Laplacian). In our work, we use Laplacian approximation since the L1 norm converges quickly with good results. For each image Iˆi , we try to maximize the probability P(IBi , IRi ) in order to separate the two layers and this is equivalent to minimizing the cost log P(IBi , IRi ). Following the same deduction tinh e[ c7]o,s tw −ithlo tgheP independent assumption of the two layers (i.e. P(IBi , IRi ) = P(IBi ) · P(IRi )), the objective function becomes: − J(IBi) = ? |(IBi ∗ fn)(x)| + |((Iˆi − IBi) ∗ fn)(x)| ?x, ?n + λ?EBi(x)|((Iˆi − IBi) ∗ fn)(x)| ?x, ?n + λ?ERi(x)|(IBi ?x,n ∗ fn)(x)|, (7) where fn denotes the derivative filters and ∗ is the 2D convolution operator. hFeo rd efrniv, we use trwso a nodri e∗n istat tihoen 2s Dan cdo nt-wo degrees (first order and second order) derivative filters. While the first term in the objective function keeps the gradients of the two layer as sparse as possible, the last two terms force the gradients of IBi at edges positions in EBi to agree with the gradients of input image Iˆi and gradients of IRi at edge positions in ERi agree with the gradients of Iˆi. This equation can be further rewritten in the form of J = ?Au b? 1 and be minimized efficiently using iterative − reweighted lbea?st square [11]. 2.5. Combining the Results Our approach processes each image in the input set independently. Due to the reflective glass surface, some of the images may contain saturated regions from specular highlights. When saturation occurs, we can not fully recover the structure in these saturated regions because the information about the two layers are lost. In addition, sometimes the edges of the reflection in some regions are too weak to be correctly distinguished. This can lead to local regions in the background where the reflection is still present. These erroneous regions are often in different places in each input image due to changes in the reflection. In such cases, it is reasonable to assume that the minimum value across all recovered background layers may be a proper approximation of the true background. As such, the last step of our method is to take the minimum of the pixel value of all reconstructed background images as the final recovered background, as follows: IB (x) = mini IBi (x) . 22443355 (8) Fig. 5. This figure shows our combination procedure. The recovered background on each single image is good at first glance but may have reflection remaining in local regions. A simple minimum operator combining all recovered images gives a better result in these regions. The comparison can be seen in the zoomed-in regions. × Based on this, the reflection layer of each input image can be computed by IRi = IB . The effectiveness of this combination procedure is ill−us Itrated in Figure 5. Iˆi − 3. Results In this section, we present the experimental results of our proposed method. Additional results and test cases can be found in the accompanying supplemental materials. The experiments were conducted on an Intel i7? PC (3.4GHz CPU, 8.0GB RAM). The code was implemented in Matlab. We use the SIFT-Flow implementation provided by the authors 1. Matlab code and images used in our paper can be downloaded at the author’s webpage 2. The entire procedure outlined in Figure 3 takes approximately five minutes for a 500 400 image sequence containing up to five images.

Figure 6 shows two examples of our edge separation results and final reconstructed background layers and reflection layers. Our method provides a clear separation of the edges of the two layers which is crucial in the reconstruc- 1http://people.csail.mit.edu/celiu/SIFTflow/SIFTflow.zip 2http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/ liyu1988/ tion step. Figure 9 shows more reflection removal results of our method. We also compare our methods with those in [8] and [5]. For the method in [8], we use the source code 3 of the author to generate the results. The comparisons between our and [8] are not entirely fair since [8] uses single image to generate the result, while we have the advantage of the entire set. For the results produced by [8], the reference view was used as input. The required user-markup is also provided. For the method in [5], we set the layer number to be one, and estimate the motions of the background layer using their method. In the reconstruction phase, we set the remaining reflection layer in k input mixture images as k different layers, each only appearing once in one mixture. Figure 8 shows the results of two examples. Our results are arguably the best. The results of [8] still exhibited some edges from different layers even with the elaborate user mark-ups. This may be fixed by going back to further refine the user markup. But in the heavily overlapping edge regions, it is challenging for users to indicate the edges. If the edges are not clearly indicated the results tend to be over smoothed in one layer. For the method of [5], since it uses global transformations to align images, local misalignment effects often appear in the final recovered background image. Also, their approach uses all the input image into the optimization to recover the layers. This may lead to the result that has edges from different reflection layers of different images mixed and appear as ghosting effect in the recovered background image. For heavily saturated regions, none of the two previous methods can give visually plausible results like ours. 4. Discussion and Conclusion We have presented a method to automatically remove reflectance interference due to a glass surface. Our approach works by capturing a set of images of a scene from slightly varying view points. The images are then aligned and edges are labelled as belonging to either background or reflectance. This alignment was enabled by SIFT-flow, whose robustness to the reflection interference enabled our method. When using SIFT-flow, we assume that the background layer will be the most prominent and will provide sufficient SIFT features for matching. While we found this to work well in practice, images with very strong reflectance can produce poor alignment as SIFT-flow may attempt to align to the foreground which is changing. This will cause problems in the subsequent layer separation. Figure 7 shows such a case. While these failures can often be handled by cropping the image or simple user input (see supplemental material), it is a notable issue. Another challenging issue is when the background scene 3http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/ levina/papers/reflections.zip 22443366 ??? ??? ?? ??? Fig. 6. Example of edge separation results and recovered background and foreground layer using our method has large homogeneous regions. In such cases there are no edges to be labelled as background. This makes subsequent separation challenging, especially when the reflection interference in these regions is weak but still visually noticeable. While this problem is not unique to our approach, it is an issue to consider. We also found that by combining all the background results of the input images we can overcome Fig. 7. A failure case of our approach due to dominant reflection against the background in some regions (i.e. the upper part of the phonograph). This will cause unsatisfactory alignment of the background in the warping procedure which further lead to our edge separation and final reconstruction failure as can be seen in the figure. local regions with high saturation. While a simple idea, this combination strategy can be incorporated into other techniques to improve their results. Lastly, we believe reflection removal is an application that would be welcomed on many mobile devices, however, the current processing time is still too long for real world use. Exploring ways to speed up the processing pipeline is an area of interest for future work. Acknowledgement This work was supported by Singapore A*STAR PSF grant 11212100. References [1] A. K.

<p>Author: Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new Deep Decompositional Network (DDN) for parsing pedestrian images into semantic regions, such as hair, head, body, arms, and legs, where the pedestrians can be heavily occluded. Unlike existing methods based on template matching or Bayesian inference, our approach directly maps low-level visual features to the label maps of body parts with DDN, which is able to accurately estimate complex pose variations with good robustness to occlusions and background clutters. DDN jointly estimates occluded regions and segments body parts by stacking three types of hidden layers: occlusion estimation layers, completion layers, and decomposition layers. The occlusion estimation layers estimate a binary mask, indicating which part of a pedestrian is invisible. The completion layers synthesize low-level features of the invisible part from the original features and the occlusion mask. The decomposition layers directly transform the synthesized visual features to label maps. We devise a new strategy to pre-train these hidden layers, and then fine-tune the entire network using the stochastic gradient descent. Experimental results show that our approach achieves better segmentation accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods on pedestrian images with or without occlusions. Another important contribution of this paper is that it provides a large scale benchmark human parsing dataset1 that includes 3, 673 annotated samples collected from 171 surveillance videos. It is 20 times larger than existing public datasets.</p><p>4 0.52525157 <a title="420-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Deep_Learning_for_Pedestrian_Detection.html">220 iccv-2013-Joint Deep Learning for Pedestrian Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Feature extraction, deformation handling, occlusion handling, and classi?cation are four important components in pedestrian detection. Existing methods learn or design these components either individually or sequentially. The interaction among these components is not yet well explored. This paper proposes that they should be jointly learned in order to maximize their strengths through cooperation. We formulate these four components into a joint deep learning framework and propose a new deep network architecture1. By establishing automatic, mutual interaction among components, the deep model achieves a 9% reduction in the average miss rate compared with the current best-performing pedestrian detection approaches on the largest Caltech benchmark dataset.</p><p>5 0.49230015 <a title="420-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Scene_Collaging%3A_Analysis_and_Synthesis_of_Natural_Images_with_Semantic_Layers.html">375 iccv-2013-Scene Collaging: Analysis and Synthesis of Natural Images with Semantic Layers</a></p>
<p>Author: Phillip Isola, Ce Liu</p><p>Abstract: To quickly synthesize complex scenes, digital artists often collage together visual elements from multiple sources: for example, mountainsfrom New Zealand behind a Scottish castle with wisps of Saharan sand in front. In this paper, we propose to use a similar process in order to parse a scene. We model a scene as a collage of warped, layered objects sampled from labeled, reference images. Each object is related to the rest by a set of support constraints. Scene parsing is achieved through analysis-by-synthesis. Starting with a dataset of labeled exemplar scenes, we retrieve a dictionary of candidate object segments thaOt miginaatl icmhag ea querEdyi eimd im-a age. We then combine elements of this set into a “scene collage ” that explains the query image. Beyond just assigning object labels to pixels, scene collaging produces a lot more information such as the number of each type of object in the scene, how they support one another, the ordinal depth of each object, and, to some degree, occluded content. We exploit this representation for several applications: image editing, random scene synthesis, and image-to-anaglyph.</p><p>6 0.4910104 <a title="420-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Pyramid_Coding_for_Functional_Scene_Element_Recognition_in_Video_Scenes.html">331 iccv-2013-Pyramid Coding for Functional Scene Element Recognition in Video Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Xu Wang, Stefan Atev, John Wright, Gilad Lerman</p><p>Abstract: The problem of efficiently deciding which of a database of models is most similar to a given input query arises throughout modern computer vision. Motivated by applications in recognition, image retrieval and optimization, there has been significant recent interest in the variant of this problem in which the database models are linear subspaces and the input is either a point or a subspace. Current approaches to this problem have poor scaling in high dimensions, and may not guarantee sublinear query complexity. We present a new approach to approximate nearest subspace search, based on a simple, new locality sensitive hash for subspaces. Our approach allows point-tosubspace query for a database of subspaces of arbitrary dimension d, in a time that depends sublinearly on the number of subspaces in the database. The query complexity of our algorithm is linear in the ambient dimension D, allow- ing it to be directly applied to high-dimensional imagery data. Numerical experiments on model problems in image repatching and automatic face recognition confirm the advantages of our algorithm in terms of both speed and accuracy.</p><p>2 0.73517424 <a title="420-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Finding_Causal_Interactions_in_Video_Sequences.html">167 iccv-2013-Finding Causal Interactions in Video Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Mustafa Ayazoglu, Burak Yilmaz, Mario Sznaier, Octavia Camps</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of detecting causal interactions in video clips. Specifically, the goal is to detect whether the actions of a given target can be explained in terms of the past actions of a collection of other agents. We propose to solve this problem by recasting it into a directed graph topology identification, where each node corresponds to the observed motion of a given target, and each link indicates the presence of a causal correlation. As shown in the paper, this leads to a block-sparsification problem that can be efficiently solved using a modified Group-Lasso type approach, capable of handling missing data and outliers (due for instance to occlusion and mis-identified correspondences). Moreover, this approach also identifies time instants where the interactions between agents change, thus providing event detection capabilities. These results are illustrated with several examples involving non–trivial interactions amongst several human subjects. 1. Introduction and Motivation The problem of identifying causal interactions amongst targets in a video sequence has been the focus of considerable attention in the past few years. A large portion of the existing body of work in this field uses human annotated video to build a storyline that includes both recognizing the activities involved and the causal relationships between them (see for instance [10] and references therein). While these methods are powerful and work well when suitably annotated data is available, annotating video clips is expensive and parsing relevant actions requires domain knowledge which may not be readily available. Indeed, in many situations, unveiling potentially hidden causal relationships is a first step towards building such knowledge. In this paper we consider the problem of identifying causal interactions amongst targets, not necessarily human, ∗This work was supported by NSF grants IIS–0713003, IIS-1318145, and ECCS–0901433, AFOSR grant FA9559–12–1–0271, and the Alert DHS Center of Excellence under Award Number 2008-ST-061-ED0001 . from unannotated video sequences and without prior domain knowledge. Our approach exploits the concept of “Granger Causality” [9], that formalizes the intuitive idea that ifa time series {x(t)} is causally related to a second one {thya(tt)if}a, ttihmene knowledge }oifs tchaeu past vrealluateesd otfo a{yse}c1to should l{eya(dt t}o, a ebnett kern prediction o thf efu ptuasret vvaalulueess ooff {{yx}}tt+k. In [l1ea4d], Pora ab bheatktearr eprt.e aicl.t successfully vuasleude a frequency domain reformulation of this concept to uncover pairwise interactions in scenarios involving repeating events, such as social games. This technique was later extended in [17] to model causal correlations between human joints and applied to the problem of activity classification. However, since this approach is based upon estimating the crosscovariance density function between events, it cannot handle situations where these events are non repeating, are too rare to provide an accurate estimate, or where these estimates are biased by outliers or missing data. Further, estimating a pairwise measure of causal correlation requires a spectral factorization of the cross-covariance, followed by numerical integration and statistical thresholding, limiting the approach to moderately large problems. To circumvent these problems, in this paper we propose an alternative approach based upon recasting the problem into that of identifying the topology of a sparse (directed) graph, where each node corresponds to the time traces of relevant features of a target, and each link corresponds to a regressor. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 1 using as an example the problem of finding causal relations amongst 4 tennis players, leading to a graph with 4 nodes, and potentially 12 (directed) links. Note that in general, the problem of identifying causal relationships is ill posed (unless one wants to identify the set of all individuals that could possibly have causal connections), due to the existence of secondary interactions. To illustrate this point, consider a very simplistic scenario with three actors A, B, and C, where A copies (with some delay) the actions of B, which in turn mimics C, also with some delay. In this situation, the ac- tions of A can be explained in terms of either those of B delayed one time sample, or those of C delayed by two samples. Thus, an algorithm based upon a statistical analysis 33556758 would identify a causal connection between A and C, even though there is no direct link between them. Further, if the actions of C can be explained by some simple autoregressive model of the form: = C(t) ?aiC(t − i) then it follows that the acti?ons of A can be explained by the same model, e.g. = A(t) ?aiA(t − i) Hence, multiple graphs topologies, some of which include self-loops, can explain the same set of time-series. On the other hand, note that in this situation, the sparsest graph (in the sense of having the fewest links) is the one that correctly captures the causality relations: the most direct cause of A is B and that of B is C, with C potentially being explained by a self-loop. To capture this feature and regularize the problem, in the sequel we will seek to find the sparsest graph, in the sense of having the least number of interconnections, that explains the observed data, reflecting the fact that, when alternative models are possible, often the most parsimonious is the correct one. Our main result shows that the problem of identifying sparse graph structures from observed noisy data can be reduced to a convex optimization problem (via the use of Group Lasso type arguments) that can be efficiently solved. The advantages of the proposed methods are: • • • • Its ability to handle complex scenarios involving nonrepeating events, een cvoimropnlmeexn stcael changes, clvoillnegct nioonnsof targets that do not necessarily split into well defined groups, outliers and missing data.

These algorithms have been shown to substantially outperform conventional convex-optimization solvers both in terms of memory and computation time requirements. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we provide a formal reformulation of the problem of finding causal relationships between agents as a sparse graph identification problem. In section 3, we show that this problem can be efficiently solved using a re-weighted Group Lasso approach. Moreover, as shown there, the resulting problem can be solved one node at a time using first order methods, which allows for handling situations involving a large number of agents. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated in section 4 using both simple scenarios (for which ground truth is readily available) and video clips of sports, involving complex, nonrepeating interactions amongst many agents.

Consider a scenario with P moving agents, and denote by the 3D homogenous coordinates of the pth individual at time t. Motivated by the idea of Granger Causality, we will say that the actions of this agent depend causally from those in a set Ip (which can possibly contain p itself), if can be written as: Q˜p(t) Q˜p(t) Q˜p(t) ?N = ? ?ajp(n)Q˜j(t − n) +˜ η p(t) +˜ u p(t) (1) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 Here ajp are unknown coefficients, and ˜η p(t) and up(t) represent measurement noise and a piecewise constant signal that is intended to account for relatively rare events that cannot be explained by the (past) actions of other agents. Examples include interactions of an agent with the environment, for instance to avoid obstacles, or changes in the interactions between agents. Since these events are infrequent, we will model as a signal that has (component-wise) a sparse derivative. Note in passing that since (1) involves homogeneous coordinates, the coefficients aj,p(.) satisfy the following constraint1 u ?N ? ?ajp(n) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 =1 (2) Our goal is to identify causal relationships using as data 2D measurements qp(t) in F frames of the affine projections of the 3D coordinates Q˜p(t) of the targets. Note that, under the affine camera assumption, the 2D coordinates are related exactly by the same regressor parameters [2]. Thus, (1) holds if and only if: ?N qp(t) = ? ?ajp(n)qj(t − n) + u˜ p(t) + ηp(t) (3) j?∈Ip ?n=0 In this context, the problem can be precisely stated as: Given qp(t) (in F number of frames) and some a-priori bound N on the order of the regressors (that is the “memory” of the interactions), find the sparsest set of equations of the form (3) that explains the data, that is: aj,pm,ηinp,up?nIp (4) subject to? ?(2) and: = ? ?ajp(n)qj(t − n) + ?N qp(t) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 up(t) + ηp(t) , p = 1 . . . , P and t = 1, ..F 1This follows by considering the third coordinate in (1) (5) where nIp denotes the cardinality of the set Ip.

For instance, [1] proposed a Lasso type algorithm to identify a sparse network where each link corresponds to a VAR process. The main idea underlying this method is to exploit the fact that penalizing the ?1 norm of the vector of regression coefficients tends to produce sparse solutions. However, enforcing sparsity of the entire vector of regressor coefficients does not necessarily result in a sparse graph structure, since the resulting solution can consist of many links, each with a few coefficients. This difficulty can be circumvented by resorting to group Lasso type approaches [18], which seek to enforce block sparsity by using a combination of ?1 and ?2 norm constraints on the coefficients of the regressor. While this approach was shown to work well with artificial data in [11], exact recovery of the underlying network can be only guaranteed when the data satisfies suitable “incoherence” type conditions [4]. Finally, a different approach was pursued in [13], based on the use of a modified Orthogonal Least Squares algorithm, Cyclic Orthogonal Least Squares. However, this approach requires enforcing an a-priori limit on the number of links allowed to point to a single node, and such information may not be readily available, specially in cases where this number has high variability amongst nodes. To address these difficulties, in the next section we develop a convex optimization based approach to the problem of identifying sparse graph structures from observed noisy data. This method is closest in spirit to that in [11], in the sense that it is also based on a group Lasso type argument. The main differences consist in the ability to handle the unknown inputs up(t), needed to model exogenous disturbances affecting the agents, and in a reformulation of the problem, that allows for using a re-weighted iterative type algorithm, leading to substantially sparser solutions, even when the conditions in [4] fail. 3. Causality Identification Algorithm In this section we present the main result of this paper, an algorithm to search for block-sparse solutions to (7). For each fixed p, the algorithm searches for sparse solutions to (6) by solving (iteratively) the following problem (suggested by the re-weighted heuristic proposed in [7]) ?P ap,muxipn,uypi?=1wja(?aip?2) + λ??diag(wu)[Δuxp;Δuyp]??1 subject to: ?ηp ? ≤ p = 1, . . , P. ∞ ?P ?, ?N ??aip(n) i?= ?1 ?n=0 ?. = 1, p = 1,...,P. (9) where [Δuxp ; Δuyp] represents the first order differences of the exogenous input vector [uxp ; uyp], Wa and Wu are weighting matrices, and λ is a Lagrange multiplier that plays the role of a tuning parameter between graph sparsity and event sensitivity. Intuitively, for a fixed set of weights w, the algorithm attempts to find a block sparse solution to (6) and a set of sparse inp?uts Δuxp ; Δuyp , by exploiting the facts that minimizing ?i ?aip ?2 (the ?2,1 norm of the vector sequence {aip}) te?nds? tao m?aximize block-sparsity [18], while minimizing et?nhed s? 1t norm mmaizxeim blizoceks sparsity [ [1168]]. wOhniclee t mheisnesolutions are found, the weights w are adjusted to penalize those elements of the sequences with small values, so that in the next iteration solutions that set these elements to zero (hence further increasing sparsity) are favored. Note however, that proceeding in this way, requires solving at each iteration a problem with n = P(Pnr + F) variables, where P and F denote the number of agents and frames, respectively, and where nr is a bound on the regressor order. On the other hand, it is easily seen that both the objective function and the constraints in (9) can be partitioned into P groups, with the pth group involving only the variables related to the pth node. It follows then that problem (9) can be solved by solving P smaller problems of the form: ?P ap,muxipn,uypi?=1wja(?aip?2) + λ??diag(wu)[Δuxp;Δuyp]??1 ?P subject to: ?ηp?∞ ?N ≤ ? and ??aip(n) i?= ?1 ?n=0 leading to the algorithm given below: =1 (10) Algorithm 1: REWEIGHTEDCAUSALITYALGORITHM for each p wa = [1, 1, ..., 1] = [1, 1, ..., 1] S > 1(self loop weight) s = [1, 1, ..., S, ..., 1] (p’th element is S) while not converged do 1. solve (9) 2. wja = 1/( ?aip ?2 + δ) 3. wja = wja ◦ s (Penalization self loops) 4. = 1./(abs([Δuxp ; Δuyp]) + δ) end while 5. At this point ajp(.) , Ip and up(t) have been identified end for wu wu It is worth emphasizing that, since the computational complexity of standard interior point methods grows as n3, solving these smaller P problems leads to roughly a O(P2) 33557781 reduction in computational time over solving a single, larger optimization. Thus, this approach can handle moderately large problems using standard, interior-point based, semidefinite optimization solvers. Larger problems can be accommodated by noting that the special form of the objective and constraints allow for using iterative Augmented La- grangian Type Methods (ALM), based upon computing, at each step, the closed form solution to suitable intermediate optimization problems. While a complete derivation of such an algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper, using results from [12] it can be shown that each step requires only a combination of thresholding and least-squares approximations. Moreover, it can be shown that such an algorithm converges Q-superlinearly. 4. Handling Outliers and Missing Data The algorithm outlined above assumes an ideal situation where the data matrix B is perfectly known. However, in practice many of its elements may be outliers (due to misidentified correspondences) or missing (due to occlusion). As we briefly show next, these situations can be efficiently handled by performing a structured robust PCA step [3] to obtain a “clean” data matrix, prior to applying Algorithm 1. From equation (6) it follows that, in the absence of exogenous inputs and noise: ?xy11.. . .yxPP? = ?XY11.. . .YXPP? ?a1...aP?

Experimental Results In this section we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using several video clips (provided as supplemental material). The results of the experiments are displayed using graphs embedded on the video frames: An arrow indicates causal correlation between agents, with the point of the arrow indicating the agent whose actions are affected by the agent at its tail. The internal parameters of the algorithm were experimentally tuned, leading to the values ? = 0.1, = 0.05, self loop weights S = 10. The algorithm is fairly insensitive to the value of the regularization parameters and S, which could be adjusted up or down by an order of magnitude without affecting the structure of the resulting graph. Finally, we used regressor order N=2 for the first three examples and N=4 for the last one, a choice that is consistent with the frame rate and the complexity of λ λ the actions taking place in each clip. 5.1. Clips from the UT-Interaction Data Set We considered two video clips from the UT Human Interaction Data Set [15] (sequences 6 and 16). Figures 2 and 5 compare the results obtained applying the proposed algorithm versus Group Lasso (GL) [11] and Group Lasso combined with the reweighted heuristic described in (9) (GLRW). In all cases, the inputs to the algorithm were the (approximate) coordinates of the heads of each of the agents, normalized to the interval [−1, 1], artificially corrupted ,w niothrm m10al%iz eodut tloie trhs.e Notably, [t−he1 proposed algorithm 2As shown in [6, 8] under suitable conditions these relaxations the exact minimum rank solution. 33557792 recover Figure 2.

Only the proposed method identifies the correct connections. was able to correctly identify the correlations between the agents from this very limited amount of information, while the others failed to do so. Note in passing that in both cases none of the algorithms were directly applicable, due to some of the individuals leaving the field of view or being occluded. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the missing data was recovered by solving an RPCA problem prior to applying Algorithm 1. Finally, Fig. 4 sheds more insight on the key role played by the sparse signal u. As shown there, changes in u correspond exactly to time instants when the behavior of the corresponding agent deviates from the general pattern followed during most of the clip. Figure 3. Time traces of the individual heads in the UT sequence 6, artificially corrupted with 10 % outliers. The outliers were removed and the missing data due to targets leaving the field of view was estimated solving a modified RPCA problem. Frame number Figure 4.

Doubles Tennis Experiment This experiment considers a non-staged real-life scenario. The data consists of 230 frames of a video clip from the Australian Open Tennis Doubles Final games. The goal here is to identify causal relationships between the different players using time traces of the respective centroid positions. Note that in this case the ground truth is not available. Nevertheless, since players from the same team usually look at their opponents and react to their motions, we expect a strong causality connection between members of 33557803 opposite teams. This intuition is matched by the correlations unveiled by the algorithm, shown in Fig. 6. The identified sparse input corresponding to the vertical direction is shown in Fig. 7 (similar results for the horizontal component are omitted due to space reasons.) Figure 6. Sample frames from the tennis sequence. Top: The proposed method correctly identifies interactions between opposite team members. Center: Reweighted Group Lasso misses the interaction between the two rear-most individuals of opposite teams, generating self loops instead (denoted by the disks). Bottom: Group Lasso yields an almost complete graph. Figure 7. Exogenous signal corresponding to the vertical axis for the tennis sequence. The change in one component corresponds to the instant when the leftmost player in the bottom team moves from the line towards the net, remaining closer to it from then on. 5.3. Basketball Game Experiment This experiment considers the interactions amongst players in a basketball game. As in the case ofthe tennis players, since the data comes from a real life scenario, the ground truth is not available. However, contrary to the tennis game, this scenario involves complex interactions amongst many players, and causality is hard to discern by inspection. Nevertheless, the results shown in Fig. 8, obtained using the position of the centroids as inputs to our algorithm, match our intuition. Firstly, one would expect a strong cause/effect connection between the actions of the player with the ball and the two defending opponents facing him. These connections (denoted by the yellow arrows) were indeed successfully identified by the algorithm. The next set of causal correlations is represented by the (blue, light green) and (black, white) arrow pairs showing the defending and the opponent players on the far side of the field and under the hoop. An important, counterintuitive, connection identified by the algorithm is represented by the magenta arrows be- tween the right winger of the white team with two of his teammates: the one holding the ball and the one running behind all players. While at first sight this connection is not as obvious as the others, it becomes apparent towards the end of the sequence, when the right winger player is signaling with a raised arm. Notably, our algorithm was able to unveil this signaling without the need to perform a semantic analysis (a very difficult task here, since this signaling is apparent only in the last few frames). Rather, it used the fact that the causal correlation was encapsulated in the dynamics of the relative motions of these players. 6. Conclusions In this paper we propose a new method for detecting causal interactions between agents using video data. The main idea is to recast this problem into a blind directed graph topology identification, where each node corresponds to the observed motion of a given target, each link indicates the presence of a causal correlation and the unknown inputs account for changes in the interaction patterns. In turn, this problem can be reduced to that of finding block-sparse solutions to a set of linear equations, which can be efficiently accomplished using an iterative re-weighted Group-Lasso approach. The ability of the algorithm to correctly identify causal correlations, even in cases where portions of the data record are missing or corrupted by outliers, and the key role played by the unknown exogenous input were illustrated with several examples involving non–trivial inter- actions amongst several human subjects. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm was able to identify both the correct interactions and the time instants when interactions amongst agents changed, based on minimal motion information: in all cases we used just a single time trace per person. This success indicates that in many scenarios, the dynamic information contained in the motion pattern of a single feature associated with a target is rich enough to enable identifying complex interaction patterns, without the need to track multiple features, perform a semantic analysis or use additional domain knowledge. 33557814 Figure 8.

<p>Author: Adriana Kovashka, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: In interactive image search, a user iteratively refines his results by giving feedback on exemplar images. Active selection methods aim to elicit useful feedback, but traditional approaches suffer from expensive selection criteria and cannot predict informativeness reliably due to the imprecision of relevance feedback. To address these drawbacks, we propose to actively select “pivot” exemplars for which feedback in the form of a visual comparison will most reduce the system’s uncertainty. For example, the system might ask, “Is your target image more or less crowded than this image? ” Our approach relies on a series of binary search trees in relative attribute space, together with a selection function that predicts the information gain were the user to compare his envisioned target to the next node deeper in a given attribute ’s tree. It makes interactive search more efficient than existing strategies—both in terms of the system ’s selection time as well as the user’s feedback effort.</p><p>5 0.6442827 <a title="420-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Codemaps_-_Segment%2C_Classify_and_Search_Objects_Locally.html">77 iccv-2013-Codemaps - Segment, Classify and Search Objects Locally</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenyang Li, Efstratios Gavves, Koen E.A. van_de_Sande, Cees G.M. Snoek, Arnold W.M. Smeulders</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we aim for segmentation and classification of objects. We propose codemaps that are a joint formulation of the classification score and the local neighborhood it belongs to in the image. We obtain the codemap by reordering the encoding, pooling and classification steps over lattice elements. Other than existing linear decompositions who emphasize only the efficiency benefits for localized search, we make three novel contributions. As a preliminary, we provide a theoretical generalization of the sufficient mathematical conditions under which image encodings and classification becomes locally decomposable. As first novelty we introduce ℓ2 normalization for arbitrarily shaped image regions, which is fast enough for semantic segmentation using our Fisher codemaps. Second, using the same lattice across images, we propose kernel pooling which embeds nonlinearities into codemaps for object classification by explicit or approximate feature mappings. Results demonstrate that ℓ2 normalized Fisher codemaps improve the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation for PAS- CAL VOC. For object classification the addition of nonlinearities brings us on par with the state-of-the-art, but is 3x faster. Because of the codemaps ’ inherent efficiency, we can reach significant speed-ups for localized search as well. We exploit the efficiency gain for our third novelty: object segment retrieval using a single query image only.</p><p>6 0.62531638 <a title="420-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-STAR3D%3A_Simultaneous_Tracking_and_Reconstruction_of_3D_Objects_Using_RGB-D_Data.html">366 iccv-2013-STAR3D: Simultaneous Tracking and Reconstruction of 3D Objects Using RGB-D Data</a></p>

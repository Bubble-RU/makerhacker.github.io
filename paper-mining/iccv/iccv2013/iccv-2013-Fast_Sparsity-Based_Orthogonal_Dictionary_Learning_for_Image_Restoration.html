</p><p>3 However, if the correlations among dictionary atoms are not well constrained, the redundancy of the dictionary does not necessarily improve the performance of sparse coding. [sent-9, score-1.766]
</p><p>4 This paper proposed a fast orthogonal dictionary learning method for sparse image representation. [sent-10, score-1.139]
</p><p>5 With comparable performance on several image restoration tasks, the proposed method is much more computationally efficient than the over-complete dictionary based learning methods. [sent-11, score-1.01]
</p><p>6 It is now well established that the sparse image models are very powerful tools for many image restoration and recognition tasks. [sent-14, score-0.312]
</p><p>7 Sparse image model assumes that most local image patches can be well approximated by a sparse linear combination of basis elements, the so-called atoms. [sent-15, score-0.236]
</p><p>8 A fundamental question is then how to find a dictionary under which an input image can be sparsely modelled. [sent-17, score-0.754]
</p><p>9 Earlier work on designing dictionary for sparse image modelling focuses on the design of fixed orthogonal dictionaries, e. [sent-18, score-1.114]
</p><p>10 The basic idea is to learn the dictionary adaptive to the target image so as to achieve better sparsity than the fixed ones. [sent-29, score-0.768]
</p><p>11 Most existing dictionary learning methods consider an over-complete dictionary and formulate the learning process as a minimization problem. [sent-30, score-1.662]
</p><p>12 Taking the popular K-SVD method [12] for example, the K-SVD method learns an over-complete dictionary from an input image via solving the following minimization model:  Dm,{αini}? [sent-31, score-0.927]
</p><p>13 The iteration scheme for solving (1) is proposed in [12] which alternatively iterates between two modules: sparse coding for {αi} and dictionary updating mforo Dule. [sent-44, score-1.125]
</p><p>14 In this paper, we proposed a new variational model to learn an adaptive dictionary for sparse image modelling. [sent-61, score-0.849]
</p><p>15 Different from the K-SVD method, the dictionary learned in our approach is an orthogonal dictionary. [sent-62, score-0.971]
</p><p>16 The seemingly performance loss on sparse coding when adopting an orthogonal dictionary over an over-complete dictionary indeed has little negative impact on the performance of image restoration. [sent-63, score-1.951]
</p><p>17 The performance of the proposed orthogonal dictionary learning method is at least comparable to the K-SVD method in several image restoration applications. [sent-64, score-1.229]
</p><p>18 The gain by using an orthogonal dictionary is very noticeable. [sent-65, score-0.971]
</p><p>19 In short, the proposed sparsity-based orthogonal dictionary learning method is much faster than the K-SVD method but with comparable performance in image restoration, 1. [sent-67, score-1.067]
</p><p>20 Motivation and our contributions The main computational issue of the K-SVD method comes from the fact that the dictionary D ∈ Rn×k is a highly rferdoumnd tahent dictionary e(k d =ict 4onna riny [ D12] )∈ ∈w Rhich lacks additional constraints on the correlations among atoms. [sent-69, score-1.529]
</p><p>21 The purpose using such a high redundant dictionary is for maximizing the sparsity of the code {αj } by having more atoms imn zthineg dictionary. [sent-70, score-0.984]
</p><p>22 Hofo twheev ceord, although a highly o rerdeu antodamnst dictionary allows the existence of more sparse codes, accurately estimating these code becomes less computationally feasible with the increased redundancy. [sent-71, score-0.874]
</p><p>23 One well-known measure on the quality of dictionary for sparse coding is the so-called mutual incoherence μ(D) ([11]) defined as μ(D)  = mi? [sent-72, score-1.016]
</p><p>24 It is known in compressed sensing literatures that the mutual in-  coherence constant μ(D) need to be small enough to guarantee the performance of sparse coding when using matching pursuit methods (see e. [sent-79, score-0.288]
</p><p>25 However, the constant μ of the redundant dictionary obtained via the K-SVD method and its variations usually is not small, as no constraints on its mutual incoherence are imposed during dictionary updating. [sent-82, score-1.616]
</p><p>26 In other words, the sparse coding using a redundant dictionary with large μ(D) becomes not only computationally demanding, but also may not be optimal. [sent-83, score-1.055]
</p><p>27 The negative impact of the dictionary with large μ(D) has been noticed in various sparse coding based recognition systems; see e. [sent-84, score-0.956]
</p><p>28 One solution is to simultaneously minimize the term μ(D) when update the dictionary which leads to a complex non-convex minimization problem. [sent-87, score-0.864]
</p><p>29 Moreover, the ideal atoms of the learned dictionary should be those represents repetitive local image patterns. [sent-88, score-0.894]
</p><p>30 For example, it is shown in [22] that the dimension of the dictionary learned by the K-SVD method for face images can be reduced by half without causing much performance loss. [sent-91, score-0.727]
</p><p>31 In summary, we argue that when learning a dictionary for sparsity-based image restoration, a highly redundant dictionary often is not necessary for having a good sparse approximation. [sent-92, score-1.696]
</p><p>32 Instead, a dictionary with little redundancy and with very small μ(D) could perform as effi-  ×  cient as the redundant ones. [sent-93, score-0.824]
</p><p>33 For example, when using patch size of 8 8, the dictionary size of K-SVD is four times of tshizaet ooff t8h ×e proposed orthogonal dictionary. [sent-94, score-1.06]
</p><p>34 Based on the above discussions, we propose to use an orthogonal dictionary for sparsity-based dictionary learning in image restoration, which leads to the following minimization model:  D∈sR. [sent-97, score-1.86]

</p><p>37 eTrhiee adoption oomf an orthogonal dictionary will greatly simplify the computation of both dictionary updating and sparse coding. [sent-108, score-1.869]
</p><p>38 Indeed, we will show in the main body that both sparse coding and dictionary updating in our model have explicit solutions. [sent-109, score-1.032]

</p><p>42 In recent years, the concept of the adaptivity has been exploited to design the dictionary specifically optimized for the target image, the so-called dictionary learning. [sent-126, score-1.454]
</p><p>43 The earlier works [23, 15] learn the dictionary from the statistics of image features or patches to obtain a sparser representation of natural images. [sent-127, score-0.816]
</p><p>44 The pioneering K-SVD method [12] learns an over-complete dictionary as well as the sparse representations of the patches under that dictionary in an alternating minimization framework. [sent-128, score-1.805]
</p><p>45 Starting from the set of overlapping image patches collected from the input image, the K-SVD method alternatively iterates between two subproblems: sparse coding and dictionary updating. [sent-129, score-1.096]
</p><p>46 Both subproblems in [12] are based on heuristic greedy methods: the 33337858  sparse coding under the overcomplete dictionary is solved via orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and the dictionary is estimated via column-wise sequentially SVD updates. [sent-130, score-2.082]
</p><p>47 An efficient implementation of the K-SVD method is developed in [26] which uses the Batch-OMP to accelerate the sparse coding and use two simple matrix-vector product to replace the SVD operation. [sent-132, score-0.229]

</p><p>50 For example, based on the groups of similar patches, the K-SVD method is used in [17], the local PCA-based method is used in [9, 29] and the PCA-based dictionary learning is used [10] for image denoising. [sent-148, score-0.773]

Most existing dictionary learning methods consider an over-complete dictionary, e.g. the K-SVD method.

However, if the correlations among dictionary atoms are not well constrained, the redundancy of the dictionary does not necessarily improve the performance of sparse coding.

<p>Author: Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Weidong Cai, Heng Huang</p><p>Abstract: Representing the raw input of a data set by a set of relevant codes is crucial to many computer vision applications. Due to the intrinsic sparse property of real-world data, dictionary learning, in which the linear decomposition of a data point uses a set of learned dictionary bases, i.e., codes, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, traditional dictionary learning methods suffer from three weaknesses: sensitivity to noisy and outlier samples, difficulty to determine the optimal dictionary size, and incapability to incorporate supervision information. In this paper, we address these weaknesses by learning a Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSR-D). Specifically, we use the ℓ2,0+ norm as the loss function to improve the robustness against outliers, and develop a new structured sparse regularization com, , tom. . cai@sydney . edu . au , heng@uta .edu make the learning tasks easier to deal with and reduce the computational cost. For example, in image tagging, instead of using the raw pixel-wise features, semi-local or patch- based features, such as SIFT and geometric blur, are usually more desirable to achieve better performance. In practice, finding a set of compact features bases, also referred to as dictionary, with enhanced representative and discriminative power, plays a significant role in building a successful computer vision system. In this paper, we explore this important problem by proposing a novel formulation and its solution for learning Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSRD), where we examine the challenges in dictionary learning, and seek opportunities to overcome them and improve the dictionary qualities. 1.1. Challenges in Dictionary Learning to incorporate the supervision information in dictionary learning, without incurring additional parameters. Moreover, the optimal dictionary size is automatically learned from the input data. Minimizing the derived objective function is challenging because it involves many non-smooth ℓ2,0+ -norm terms.

<p>Author: Zhuoyuan Chen, Ying Wu</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity models have recently shown great promise in many vision tasks. Using a learned dictionary in sparsity models can in general outperform predefined bases in clean data. In practice, both training and testing data may be corrupted and contain noises and outliers. Although recent studies attempted to cope with corrupted data and achieved encouraging results in testing phase, how to handle corruption in training phase still remains a very difficult problem. In contrast to most existing methods that learn the dictionaryfrom clean data, this paper is targeted at handling corruptions and outliers in training data for dictionary learning. We propose a general method to decompose the reconstructive residual into two components: a non-sparse component for small universal noises and a sparse component for large outliers, respectively. In addition, , further analysis reveals the connection between our approach and the “partial” dictionary learning approach, updating only part of the prototypes (or informative codewords) with remaining (or noisy codewords) fixed.

<p>Author: Hans Lobel, René Vidal, Alvaro Soto</p><p>Abstract: Currently, Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) and part-based methods are the most popular approaches for visual recognition. In both cases, a mid-level representation is built on top of low-level image descriptors and top-level classifiers use this mid-level representation to achieve visual recognition. While in current part-based approaches, mid- and top-level representations are usually jointly trained, this is not the usual case for BoVW schemes. A main reason for this is the complex data association problem related to the usual large dictionary size needed by BoVW approaches. As a further observation, typical solutions based on BoVW and part-based representations are usually limited to extensions of binary classification schemes, a strategy that ignores relevant correlations among classes. In this work we propose a novel hierarchical approach to visual recognition based on a BoVW scheme that jointly learns suitable midand top-level representations. Furthermore, using a maxmargin learning framework, the proposed approach directly handles the multiclass case at both levels of abstraction. We test our proposed method using several popular bench- mark datasets. As our main result, we demonstrate that, by coupling learning of mid- and top-level representations, the proposed approach fosters sharing of discriminative visual words among target classes, being able to achieve state-ofthe-art recognition performance using far less visual words than previous approaches.</p><p>6 0.37647492 <a title="161-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Group_Sparsity_and_Geometry_Constrained_Dictionary_Learning_for_Action_Recognition_from_Depth_Maps.html">188 iccv-2013-Group Sparsity and Geometry Constrained Dictionary Learning for Action Recognition from Depth Maps</a></p>

<p>Author: Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Weidong Cai, Heng Huang</p><p>Abstract: Representing the raw input of a data set by a set of relevant codes is crucial to many computer vision applications. Due to the intrinsic sparse property of real-world data, dictionary learning, in which the linear decomposition of a data point uses a set of learned dictionary bases, i.e., codes, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, traditional dictionary learning methods suffer from three weaknesses: sensitivity to noisy and outlier samples, difficulty to determine the optimal dictionary size, and incapability to incorporate supervision information. In this paper, we address these weaknesses by learning a Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSR-D). Specifically, we use the ℓ2,0+ norm as the loss function to improve the robustness against outliers, and develop a new structured sparse regularization com, , tom. . cai@sydney . edu . au , heng@uta .edu make the learning tasks easier to deal with and reduce the computational cost. For example, in image tagging, instead of using the raw pixel-wise features, semi-local or patch- based features, such as SIFT and geometric blur, are usually more desirable to achieve better performance. In practice, finding a set of compact features bases, also referred to as dictionary, with enhanced representative and discriminative power, plays a significant role in building a successful computer vision system. In this paper, we explore this important problem by proposing a novel formulation and its solution for learning Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSRD), where we examine the challenges in dictionary learning, and seek opportunities to overcome them and improve the dictionary qualities. 1.1. Challenges in Dictionary Learning to incorporate the supervision information in dictionary learning, without incurring additional parameters. Moreover, the optimal dictionary size is automatically learned from the input data. Minimizing the derived objective function is challenging because it involves many non-smooth ℓ2,0+ -norm terms.

<p>Author: Radu Timofte, Vincent De_Smet, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Recently there have been significant advances in image upscaling or image super-resolution based on a dictionary of low and high resolution exemplars. The running time of the methods is often ignored despite the fact that it is a critical factor for real applications. This paper proposes fast super-resolution methods while making no compromise on quality. First, we support the use of sparse learned dictionaries in combination with neighbor embedding methods. In this case, the nearest neighbors are computed using the correlation with the dictionary atoms rather than the Euclidean distance. Moreover, we show that most of the current approaches reach top performance for the right parameters. Second, we show that using global collaborative coding has considerable speed advantages, reducing the super-resolution mapping to a precomputed projective matrix. Third, we propose the anchored neighborhood regression. That is to anchor the neighborhood embedding of a low resolution patch to the nearest atom in the dictionary and to precompute the corresponding embedding matrix. These proposals are contrasted with current state-of- the-art methods on standard images. We obtain similar or improved quality and one or two orders of magnitude speed improvements.</p><p>5 0.81148726 <a title="161-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-attributed_Dictionary_Learning_for_Sparse_Coding.html">276 iccv-2013-Multi-attributed Dictionary Learning for Sparse Coding</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuanjun Xiong, Wei Liu, Deli Zhao, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: The archetype hull model is playing an important role in large-scale data analytics and mining, but rarely applied to vision problems. In this paper, we migrate such a geometric model to address face recognition and verification together through proposing a unified archetype hull ranking framework. Upon a scalable graph characterized by a compact set of archetype exemplars whose convex hull encompasses most of the training images, the proposed framework explicitly captures the relevance between any query and the stored archetypes, yielding a rank vector over the archetype hull. The archetype hull ranking is then executed on every block of face images to generate a blockwise similarity measure that is achieved by comparing two different rank vectors with respect to the same archetype hull. After integrating blockwise similarity measurements with learned importance weights, we accomplish a sensible face similarity measure which can support robust and effective face recognition and verification. We evaluate the face similarity measure in terms of experiments performed on three benchmark face databases Multi-PIE, Pubfig83, and LFW, demonstrat- ing its performance superior to the state-of-the-arts.</p><p>3 0.8582902 <a title="161-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Direct_Super-Resolution_by_Simple_Functions.html">156 iccv-2013-Fast Direct Super-Resolution by Simple Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Chih-Yuan Yang, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: The goal of single-image super-resolution is to generate a high-quality high-resolution image based on a given low-resolution input. It is an ill-posed problem which requires exemplars or priors to better reconstruct the missing high-resolution image details. In this paper, we propose to split the feature space into numerous subspaces and collect exemplars to learn priors for each subspace, thereby creating effective mapping functions. The use of split input space facilitates both feasibility of using simple functionsfor super-resolution, and efficiency ofgenerating highresolution results. High-quality high-resolution images are reconstructed based on the effective learned priors. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed algorithmperforms efficiently and effectively over state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.85704505 <a title="161-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Transfer_Feature_Learning_with_Joint_Distribution_Adaptation.html">427 iccv-2013-Transfer Feature Learning with Joint Distribution Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang, Guiguang Ding, Jiaguang Sun, Philip S. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Transfer learning is established as an effective technology in computer visionfor leveraging rich labeled data in the source domain to build an accurate classifier for the target domain. However, most prior methods have not simultaneously reduced the difference in both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution between domains. In this paper, we put forward a novel transfer learning approach, referred to as Joint Distribution Adaptation (JDA). Specifically, JDA aims to jointly adapt both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution in a principled dimensionality reduction procedure, and construct new feature representation that is effective and robustfor substantial distribution difference. Extensive experiments verify that JDA can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art methods on four types of cross-domain image classification problems.</p><p>5 0.85597587 <a title="161-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Exemplar_Cut.html">150 iccv-2013-Exemplar Cut</a></p>

For the parametric part, we train a pylon model on a hierarchical region tree as the energy function for segmentation. For the nonparametric part, we match the input image with each exemplar by using regions to obtain a score which augments the energy function from the pylon model. Our method thus generates a set of highly plausible segmentation hypotheses by solving a series of exemplar augmented graph cuts. Experimental results on the Graz and PASCAL datasets show that the proposed algorithm achievesfavorable segmentationperformance against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and accuracy.</p><p>6 0.85420883 <a title="161-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Proportion_Priors_for_Image_Sequence_Segmentation.html">330 iccv-2013-Proportion Priors for Image Sequence Segmentation</a></p>

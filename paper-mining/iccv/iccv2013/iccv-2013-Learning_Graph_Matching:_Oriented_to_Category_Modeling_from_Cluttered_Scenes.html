</p><p>5 Introduction Attributed graph matching is a fundamental problem ranging across broad fields in computer vision and data mining, and numerous approaches have been proposed for the problem of graph matching optimization [22]. [sent-7, score-1.21]
</p><p>6 Even so, the literature on learning graph matching remains limited, despite the demonstrated power of learning techniques in this  area. [sent-8, score-0.735]
</p><p>7 The few pioneering studies of learning graph matching mainly aimed to train matching parameters, so as to obtain correct matching assignments for mapping from a graph template to a number of relatively large target graphs. [sent-9, score-1.962]
</p><p>8 In this research, we approach the learning of graph matching from the perspective of category modeling. [sent-10, score-0.771]
</p><p>9 Our aim is to incrementally modify the graph template to produce a graphical model representing the general structural knowledge of the targets objects in target graphs, and not merely train matching parameters. [sent-11, score-1.039]
</p><p>10 In so doing, we also aim to transform the conventional concept of learning for graph matching to learning based on graph matching for both object matching and recognition. [sent-13, score-1.702]
</p><p>11 Here, object recognition refers to determining whether a graph contains the target object, based on the trained model. [sent-14, score-0.351]
</p><p>12 We call the graphs that contain target objects positive  (a) to the proposed learning of graph matching (c). [sent-15, score-1.012]
</p><p>13 Different from conventional learning of graph matching (b), our method aims to modify the initial graph template into a graphical model, so as to achieve good performance in both matching and recognition. [sent-16, score-1.591]
</p><p>14 Thus, this research establishes a bridge between the learning of graph matching and the category modeling from cluttered scenes. [sent-17, score-0.837]
</p><p>15 This idea for learning gives consideration to both matching performance and recognition performance. [sent-19, score-0.378]
</p><p>16 To perform estimates of both matching parameters and model attributes, our work extends the unsupervised1 learning of graph matching proposed by Leordeanu et al. [sent-22, score-0.983]
</p><p>17 We redefine the learning of graph matching as a category modeling problem that is oriented toward not only conventional matching performance, but also object recognition. [sent-27, score-1.205]
</p><p>18 It includes the estimation of matching parameters, attributes, and graphical structure. [sent-28, score-0.363]
</p><p>19 In particular, this is the first attempt to use negative graphs in the learning of graph matching, to the best of our knowledge. [sent-29, score-0.651]
</p><p>20 Related work Most conventional algorithms for the learning of graph matching are supervised1 methods that require detailed labeling of each template node’s matching assignment in each  positive graph for training. [sent-31, score-1.575]
</p><p>21 All studies mentioned above are focused on training matching parameters for good matching performance. [sent-36, score-0.626]
</p><p>22 In addition to training the matching parameters, we modify the model (graph template) structure and estimate model attributes. [sent-38, score-0.375]
</p><p>23 To be exact, if we simplify the problem by only considering the matching between two graphs, the structural modification is related to the progressive graph matching [6] proposed by Cho et al. [sent-40, score-1.199]
</p><p>24 Most methods for object extraction from multiple images [23, 30, 33, 7, 20] related to clique mining uses a combination of two-image matching results. [sent-43, score-0.406]
</p><p>25 [12, 10, 11, 24] aim to learn the maximal frequent subgraph among several graphs with distinct node or edge labels. [sent-45, score-0.556]
</p><p>26 [18, 27] require there is no roll rotations for matching, and object extraction methods usually require the local features in images to be distinguishing enough to determine a set of potential image matching assignments during the preprocessing. [sent-50, score-0.472]
</p><p>27 In contrast, by emphasizing a general algorithm for learning graph matching, our approach remains free of such constraints. [sent-51, score-0.357]
</p><p>28 Preliminary: graph matching problem The objective of graph matching is to find correspondences between a graph template (the category model) G = (V, E, FV , FE) and an attributed graph G? [sent-55, score-2.097]

</p><p>48 Structural modification In this subsection, we use the matching results of the current G to train a classifier for object recognition. [sent-332, score-0.486]
</p><p>49 There are a variety of approaches to classification based on graph matching [9, 21], and we will obtain different classification performances by applying different classifiers to different feature. [sent-334, score-0.642]
</p><p>50 In order to achieve a natural connection between the structural modification of G and the classification mechanism, we select the linear-SVM classifier and attribute distances as our target features. [sent-335, score-0.486]

</p><p>58 Classifier-guided structural modification: Here, we combine graph matching and the SVM-based classification to identify reliable and unreliable nodes in G, as follows. [sent-379, score-0.799]
</p><p>59 Clearly, G should be better matched to positive graphs Gk+ ∈ PG than negative ones Gl− ∈ NG. [sent-380, score-0.352]

</p><p>62 In each iteration, after the estimation of matching parameters and attributes (see Section 4. [sent-398, score-0.538]

</p><p>64 Experiments The proposed method is especially useful in the field of computer vision, enabling the discovery of general ob-  ject structures for image matching when the target objects are randomly placed in cluttered scenes. [sent-404, score-0.485]
</p><p>65 We used the category dataset of Kinect RGBD images, published in [32] as a standard RGBD object dataset oriented to graph matching3. [sent-406, score-0.428]
</p><p>66 Four largest categories—notebook PC, drink box, basket, and bucket—in this dataset contained enough RGBD objects and were chosen to construct both the positive and the negative graph sets for training. [sent-407, score-0.419]
</p><p>67 We compared the proposed method with other approaches to learning graph matching and various common strategies in object extraction4. [sent-409, score-0.67]
</p><p>68 Considering the need for robustness with respect to texture variations, we applied two graphical models proposed in [32], each of which uses [2] to extract object edges and then discretizes continuous edges into line segments to produce the graph nodes (see Fig. [sent-413, score-0.506]

</p><p>70 Notation for local and pairwise attributes  briefly introduce these attributes. [sent-485, score-0.328]
</p><p>71 Experiment 1: For category modeling from ordinary RGB images, one local attribute (nU = 1) and three pairwise attributes (nP = 3) are designed, as illustrated in Fig. [sent-487, score-0.54]
</p><p>72 The firstofthe threepairwise attributes between nodes iand j is the angle between their line segments, denoted by = θ2ijD. [sent-492, score-0.401]
</p><p>73 The second pairwise attribute describes the angles between the centerline and the node line segments, denoted by = [θicenter, θcjenter], where θcienter is the angle between the line segment of iand the centerline. [sent-494, score-0.591]
</p><p>74 Experiment 2: For category modeling from RGBD images, two local attributes (nU = 2) and three pairwise attributes (nP = 3) are designed (see Fig. [sent-496, score-0.654]
</p><p>75 Cross validation and evaluation metrics: Each labeling of the target object in a given RGB or RGBD image  can produce an initial graph template and begin an individual model learning process. [sent-534, score-0.571]
</p><p>76 We used the average matching rate (AMR) to evaluate the matching performance in positive graphs. [sent-542, score-0.684]
</p><p>77 AMR is widely used to evaluate the learning of graph matching [17, 16]. [sent-543, score-0.67]
</p><p>78 The matching rate of each individual matching result indicates the proportion of model nodes that are correctly matched to the target object. [sent-544, score-0.771]
</p><p>79 AMR represents the average of individual matching rates across all matching results produced by the trained models. [sent-545, score-0.626]
</p><p>80 Competing methods: In the first step of the evaluation, we compared our method to several competing approaches to the learning of graph matching across both experiments. [sent-564, score-0.753]
</p><p>81 First, we performed graph matching without training, denoted by MA, to establish a baseline. [sent-565, score-0.605]
</p><p>82 MA uses TRW-S [14] to match the initial graph template to the target objects in images. [sent-566, score-0.506]
</p><p>83 Second, as the benchmark method for unsupervised learning of graph matching, we used [17] proposed by Leordeanu et al. [sent-567, score-0.409]
</p><p>84 Two competing approaches were obtained by applying spectral techniques [15] (LS) and TRWS [14] (LT), respectively, to solve the matching optimization of (4). [sent-571, score-0.396]
</p><p>85 Third, we designed a framework that iteratively estimates matching parameters wU, wP and model attributes FV, FE according to techniques presented in Section 4. [sent-572, score-0.538]
</p><p>86 The final competing technique involved supervised learning of graph matching (SU) based on [17]. [sent-574, score-0.753]
</p><p>87 SU required to label target objects in positive graphs and regarded matching assignments mapped onto target objects as correct ones. [sent-575, score-0.837]
</p><p>88 For the comparison of recognition performance, we trained the proposed classifiers using the matching results produced by the competing methods. [sent-609, score-0.396]
</p><p>89 This bias may produce matching errors, which, in turn, increase the bias in the unsupervised model learning, thus propagating into a significant model bias. [sent-613, score-0.445]
</p><p>90 In contrast, our method modifies biased structure in early iterations by eliminating badly matched parts, thereby reducing the prevalence of biased matching in later iterations. [sent-614, score-0.383]
</p><p>91 Conclusions In this paper, we proposed an algorithm for the learning of graph matching. [sent-617, score-0.357]
</p><p>92 This method trains the structure and attributes of the graph template, as well as matching parameters, to obtain a graphical model. [sent-618, score-0.88]
</p><p>93 By including negative graphs in the learning process, we orient the model learning toward both object matching and recognition. [sent-619, score-0.737]
</p><p>94 Our strategy for structural modification is based on the recognition mechanisms between positive and negative 1335  graphs, and exhibits better performance than conventional structural modification strategies based only on positive graphs. [sent-621, score-0.796]
</p><p>95 As the proposed strategy iteratively corrected errors in the topological structure of the initial graph template, it reduced the bias learning problem, which so afflicted pioneering work in the field. [sent-622, score-0.434]

<p>Author: Minsu Cho, Karteek Alahari, Jean Ponce</p><p>Abstract: Many tasks in computer vision are formulated as graph matching problems. Despite the NP-hard nature of the problem, fast and accurate approximations have led to significant progress in a wide range of applications. Learning graph models from observed data, however, still remains a challenging issue. This paper presents an effective scheme to parameterize a graph model, and learn its structural attributes for visual object matching. For this, we propose a graph representation with histogram-based attributes, and optimize them to increase the matching accuracy. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and show significant improvement in matching accuracy over graphs with pre-defined structures.</p><p>3 0.23338036 <a title="237-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Improving_Graph_Matching_via_Density_Maximization.html">214 iccv-2013-Improving Graph Matching via Density Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Chao Wang, Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching has been widely used in various applications in computer vision due to its powerful performance. However, it poses three challenges to image sparse feature matching: (1) The combinatorial nature limits the size of the possible matches; (2) It is sensitive to outliers because the objective function prefers more matches; (3) It works poorly when handling many-to-many object correspondences, due to its assumption of one single cluster for each graph. In this paper, we address these problems with a unified framework—Density Maximization. We propose a graph density local estimator (퐷퐿퐸) to measure the quality of matches. Density Maximization aims to maximize the 퐷퐿퐸 values both locally and globally. The local maximization of 퐷퐿퐸 finds the clusters of nodes as well as eliminates the outliers. The global maximization of 퐷퐿퐸 efficiently refines the matches by exploring a much larger matching space. Our Density Maximization is orthogonal to specific graph matching algorithms. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that it significantly boosts the true matches and enables graph matching to handle both outliers and many-to-many object correspondences.</p><p>4 0.20682156 <a title="237-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_Unified_Probabilistic_Approach_Modeling_Relationships_between_Attributes_and_Objects.html">31 iccv-2013-A Unified Probabilistic Approach Modeling Relationships between Attributes and Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoyang Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a unified probabilistic model to model the relationships between attributes and objects for attribute prediction and object recognition. As a list of semantically meaningful properties of objects, attributes generally relate to each other statistically. In this paper, we propose a unified probabilistic model to automatically discover and capture both the object-dependent and objectindependent attribute relationships. The model utilizes the captured relationships to benefit both attribute prediction and object recognition. Experiments on four benchmark attribute datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed unified model for improving attribute prediction as well as object recognition in both standard and zero-shot learning cases.</p><p>5 0.17514335 <a title="237-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Adaptation_for_Personalized_Image_Search.html">52 iccv-2013-Attribute Adaptation for Personalized Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Adriana Kovashka, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: Current methods learn monolithic attribute predictors, with the assumption that a single model is sufficient to reflect human understanding of a visual attribute. However, in reality, humans vary in how they perceive the association between a named property and image content. For example, two people may have slightly different internal models for what makes a shoe look “formal”, or they may disagree on which of two scenes looks “more cluttered”. Rather than discount these differences as noise, we propose to learn user-specific attribute models. We adapt a generic model trained with annotations from multiple users, tailoring it to satisfy user-specific labels. Furthermore, we propose novel techniques to infer user-specific labels based on transitivity and contradictions in the user’s search history. We demonstrate that adapted attributes improve accuracy over both existing monolithic models as well as models that learn from scratch with user-specific data alone. In addition, we show how adapted attributes are useful to personalize image search, whether with binary or relative attributes.</p><p>6 0.17048457 <a title="237-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Optimization_for_Consistent_Multiple_Graph_Matching.html">224 iccv-2013-Joint Optimization for Consistent Multiple Graph Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Minsu Cho, Karteek Alahari, Jean Ponce</p><p>Abstract: Many tasks in computer vision are formulated as graph matching problems. Despite the NP-hard nature of the problem, fast and accurate approximations have led to significant progress in a wide range of applications. Learning graph models from observed data, however, still remains a challenging issue. This paper presents an effective scheme to parameterize a graph model, and learn its structural attributes for visual object matching. For this, we propose a graph representation with histogram-based attributes, and optimize them to increase the matching accuracy. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and show significant improvement in matching accuracy over graphs with pre-defined structures.</p><p>3 0.89873636 <a title="237-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Optimization_for_Consistent_Multiple_Graph_Matching.html">224 iccv-2013-Joint Optimization for Consistent Multiple Graph Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Junchi Yan, Yu Tian, Hongyuan Zha, Xiaokang Yang, Ya Zhang, Stephen M. Chu</p><p>Abstract: The problem of graph matching in general is NP-hard and approaches have been proposed for its suboptimal solution, most focusing on finding the one-to-one node mapping between two graphs. A more general and challenging problem arises when one aims to find consistent mappings across a number of graphs more than two. Conventional graph pair matching methods often result in mapping inconsistency since the mapping between two graphs can either be determined by pair mapping or by an additional anchor graph. To address this issue, a novel formulation is derived which is maximized via alternating optimization. Our method enjoys several advantages: 1) the mappings are jointly optimized rather than sequentially performed by applying pair matching, allowing the global affinity information across graphs can be propagated and explored; 2) the number of concerned variables to optimize is in linear with the number of graphs, being superior to local pair matching resulting in O(n2) variables; 3) the mapping consistency constraints are analytically satisfied during optimization; and 4) off-the-shelf graph pair matching solvers can be reused under the proposed framework in an ‘out-of-thebox’ fashion. Competitive results on both the synthesized data and the real data are reported, by varying the level of deformation, outliers and edge densities. ∗Corresponding author.

<p>Author: Chao Wang, Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching has been widely used in various applications in computer vision due to its powerful performance. However, it poses three challenges to image sparse feature matching: (1) The combinatorial nature limits the size of the possible matches; (2) It is sensitive to outliers because the objective function prefers more matches; (3) It works poorly when handling many-to-many object correspondences, due to its assumption of one single cluster for each graph. In this paper, we address these problems with a unified framework—Density Maximization. We propose a graph density local estimator (퐷퐿퐸) to measure the quality of matches. Density Maximization aims to maximize the 퐷퐿퐸 values both locally and globally. The local maximization of 퐷퐿퐸 finds the clusters of nodes as well as eliminates the outliers. The global maximization of 퐷퐿퐸 efficiently refines the matches by exploring a much larger matching space. Our Density Maximization is orthogonal to specific graph matching algorithms. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that it significantly boosts the true matches and enables graph matching to handle both outliers and many-to-many object correspondences.</p><p>5 0.66957521 <a title="237-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Combining_the_Right_Features_for_Complex_Event_Recognition.html">81 iccv-2013-Combining the Right Features for Complex Event Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Tang, Bangpeng Yao, Li Fei-Fei, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of combining features extracted from video for complex event recognition. Feature combination is an especially relevant task in video data, as there are many features we can extract, ranging from image features computed from individual frames to video features that take temporal information into account. To combine features effectively, we propose a method that is able to be selective of different subsets of features, as some features or feature combinations may be uninformative for certain classes. We introduce a hierarchical method for combining features based on the AND/OR graph structure, where nodes in the graph represent combinations of different sets of features. Our method automatically learns the structure of the AND/OR graph using score-based structure learning, and we introduce an inference procedure that is able to efficiently compute structure scores. We present promising results and analysis on the difficult and large-scale 2011 TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection dataset [17].</p><p>6 0.66435623 <a title="237-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminative_Label_Propagation_for_Multi-object_Tracking_with_Sporadic_Appearance_Features.html">120 iccv-2013-Discriminative Label Propagation for Multi-object Tracking with Sporadic Appearance Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Peihua Li, Qilong Wang, Lei Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The similarity or distance measure between Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) plays a crucial role in contentbased image matching. Though the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) has shown its advantages in matching histogram features, its potentials in matching GMMs remain unclear and are not fully explored. To address this problem, we propose a novel EMD methodology for GMM matching. We ?rst present a sparse representation based EMD called SR-EMD by exploiting the sparse property of the underlying problem. SR-EMD is more ef?cient and robust than the conventional EMD. Second, we present two novel ground distances between component Gaussians based on the information geometry. The perspective from the Riemannian geometry distinguishes the proposed ground distances from the classical entropy- or divergence-based ones. Furthermore, motivated by the success of distance metric learning of vector data, we make the ?rst attempt to learn the EMD distance metrics between GMMs by using a simple yet effective supervised pair-wise based method. It can adapt the distance metrics between GMMs to speci?c classi?ca- tion tasks. The proposed method is evaluated on both simulated data and benchmark real databases and achieves very promising performance.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.76995426 <a title="237-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Graph_Matching%3A_Oriented_to_Category_Modeling_from_Cluttered_Scenes.html">237 iccv-2013-Learning Graph Matching: Oriented to Category Modeling from Cluttered Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Xianfeng Gu, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dense non-rigid 3D surface registration, which brings together Riemannian geometry and graphical models. To this end, we first introduce a generic deformation model, called Canonical Distortion Coefficients (CDCs), by characterizing the deformation of every point on a surface using the distortions along its two principle directions. This model subsumes the deformation groups commonly used in surface registration such as isometry and conformality, and is able to handle more complex deformations. We also derive its discrete counterpart which can be computed very efficiently in a closed form. Based on these, we introduce a higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) model which seamlessly integrates our deformation model and a geometry/texture similarity metric. Then we jointly establish the optimal correspondences for all the points via maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Moreover, we develop a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently perform the inference for the proposed higher-order MRF model. The resulting registration algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both dense non-rigid 3D surface registration and tracking.</p><p>5 0.69224912 <a title="237-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Measuring_Flow_Complexity_in_Videos.html">263 iccv-2013-Measuring Flow Complexity in Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Saad Ali</p><p>Abstract: In this paper a notion of flow complexity that measures the amount of interaction among objects is introduced and an approach to compute it directly from a video sequence is proposed. The approach employs particle trajectories as the input representation of motion and maps it into a ‘braid’ based representation. The mapping is based on the observation that 2D trajectories of particles take the form of a braid in space-time due to the intermingling among particles over time. As a result of this mapping, the problem of estimating the flow complexity from particle trajectories becomes the problem of estimating braid complexity, which in turn can be computed by measuring the topological entropy of a braid. For this purpose recently developed mathematical tools from braid theory are employed which allow rapid computation of topological entropy of braids. The approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of open source videos depicting variations in terms of types of moving objects, scene layout, camera view angle, motion patterns, and object densities. The results show that the proposed approach is able to quantify the complexity of the flow, and at the same time provides useful insights about the sources of the complexity.</p><p>6 0.68983978 <a title="237-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-GOSUS%3A_Grassmannian_Online_Subspace_Updates_with_Structured-Sparsity.html">182 iccv-2013-GOSUS: Grassmannian Online Subspace Updates with Structured-Sparsity</a></p>

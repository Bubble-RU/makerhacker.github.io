</p><p>2 We start with the (KpK T≤ equations of the neoctni-olnin efraarm optimization problem a thnde then use its key properties to arrive at an algorithm for Lp norm projection on the non-negative simplex. [sent-6, score-0.633]
</p><p>3 Assumptions of Laplacian, Gaussian and Generalized Gaus-  sian priors result in L1 (Lasso), L2 (Ridge regression) and Lp norm regularization. [sent-11, score-0.381]
</p><p>4 Accurate modeling of such distributions leads to Lp norm regularization with p < 1. [sent-26, score-0.442]
</p><p>5 Non-convexity of Lp norm poses a major hindrance in efficient solution to resulting optimization problem. [sent-27, score-0.47]
</p><p>6 Solving an under-determined system of equations under non-convex Lp norm prior has been known to be NP hard. [sent-28, score-0.447]
</p><p>7 transform domain image denoising, can be cast as projection of a vector on norm ball and does not involve solving an under-determined system of linear equations. [sent-32, score-0.681]
</p><p>8 Such problems can directly benefit from efficient projection on non-convex Lp norm ball. [sent-33, score-0.567]
</p><p>9 For other problems, iterative schemes such as gradient-projection can be devised with projection on non-convex norm ball as building block, which of course looses guarantee of global optimality, but presents a potentially attractive alternative to IRLS and other competing methods.

</p><p>12 Therefore, in principle, an algorithm for any one formulation can be used to find solution of the other formulation by using bisection over the regularization parameter. [sent-57, score-0.258]
</p><p>13 Such equivalence, however, breaks down in the case of non-convex norm prior. [sent-58, score-0.381]

</p><p>15 Range of norm values corresponding to such discontinuities are never attained by optimal solution of penalty function formulation. [sent-61, score-0.606]
</p><p>16 In contrast, optimal solution of projection formulation exhibits continuous decrease of projection error with increasing z as shown in Fig. [sent-62, score-0.603]
</p><p>17 Consequently, for certain range of values of z, penalty function formulation can not emulate the behavior of projection formulation. [sent-64, score-0.325]
</p><p>18 Projection function formulation can be considered a more general problem with penalty function formulation as a special case. [sent-65, score-0.193]

</p><p>27 In present work, we show that for globally optimal non-convex Lp norm projection problem, number of CSC and ESE branches can be restricted to polynomial. [sent-132, score-0.69]
</p><p>28 Furthermore, we propose a conjecture, which guarantees polynomial time complexity for RSE branch as well, thus making complete problem polynomial time. [sent-133, score-0.225]

</p><p>33 j=1  Except for the trivial case, when v lies inside norm ball and optimal solution is x = v, optimal solution of above problem will lie at boundary of norm ball. [sent-145, score-1.156]
</p><p>34 This can be proved by contradiction, by joining putative solution inside norm ball with v by a line segment and showing that intersection of this line segment with norm ball will result in better solution. [sent-146, score-1.079]
</p><p>35 Based on Lemma 3 from [7], we can work with the absolute values of the elements of v and add the sign to the projection x later such that vixi > 0. [sent-147, score-0.186]

</p><p>41 Our next proposition asserts that ordering of components of v determines ordering of components of optimal solution x. [sent-177, score-0.229]
</p><p>42 If vi >  vj,  then in optimal solution  xi  ≥  xj. [sent-180, score-0.442]
</p><p>43 Proof: If xi <  xj,  then swapping  xi  and  xj  can be shown  to result in a better solution. [sent-181, score-0.236]
</p><p>44 If vi > vj, and in optimal solution xi = 0, then xj = 0. [sent-189, score-0.492]

[sent-201, score-0.234]
</p><p>47 Hence, we adopt the more fundamental necessary condition that for the feasibility of local optimality at a point, it must be impossible to decrease objective function further by any local movement remaining feasible with the constraints. [sent-202, score-0.154]
</p><p>48 Whenever any xi is zero and  ≥  norm constraint zero component This leads us to x is optimal {xi |i ∈ Nnon  is satisfied, any local movement with nonalong xi will result in constraint violation. [sent-203, score-0.82]
</p><p>49 We plot the representative curves for different values of vi but fixed p and θ (Fig. [sent-207, score-0.209]
</p><p>50 For all values of vi > vit (p, θ), there are two roots for (7) denoted as xil and xir. [sent-212, score-0.408]
</p><p>51 The two possible solutions for vi = 8 are denoted in the figure as xil and xir. [sent-217, score-0.324]
</p><p>52 The left root xlk corresponding to any vk is NOT part of the optimal solution for (5), except possibly for the smallest vi among those with non-zero optimal projection xi. [sent-223, score-0.766]
</p><p>53 In the first stage, we note that since xil moves towards left with increasing vi, in optimal solution, two distinct entries vi and vj can not have the same root xil = xjl as it will violate Prop. [sent-225, score-0.732]
</p><p>54 This means at most one vi can have corresponding left solution at xil. [sent-228, score-0.341]
</p><p>55 In second stage of proof, we note that since, irrespective of ordering of vi’s, xir for any vi is larger than xjl for all other vj ’s, j i. [sent-229, score-0.32]
</p><p>56 Hence, any vi with corresponding solution at xil must be the smallest vi among those with non-zero xi, otherwise Prop. [sent-230, score-0.671]
</p><p>57 3 is that, combinatorial explosion of ESE can be avoided, since the number of ESE branches are upper bounded by 2. [sent-236, score-0.232]
</p><p>58 One branch corresponds to solution where smallest non-zero xi corresponds to the left root and all other xj ’s correspond to the right roots. [sent-237, score-0.562]

</p><p>69 Right: for higher dimensions and stringent  wrt xL touches the norm constraint line at multiple points. [sent-283, score-0.572]

</p><p>78 We compare against alternate projection algorithms proposed by Candes and Romburg [4](L1POCS) and Lu Gan [8](KPOCS) where the projection alternates between a POCS projection and a sparsifying projections which typically bounds the L1 norm ofthe projected vector. [sent-308, score-0.981]

</p><p>82 A hard thresholding step, keeping the K largest components of a vector is used as the second projection step. [sent-324, score-0.186]
</p><p>83 The principle difference in the two schemes is that in [8], the extra information is the sparsity of x (as in CoSaMP [17]), whereas in [4] the expected L1 norm of the original signal is required. [sent-325, score-0.516]

In order to control the accuracy/sparsity trade-off we introduce a weighting parameter on the combination of two existing relaxations, namely spectral and game-theoretic. This leads to the introduction of the elastic net penalty function into shape matching problems. In combination with an efficient algorithm to project onto the elastic net ball, we obtain an approach for deformable shape matching with controllable sparsity.

This task is formulated as an optimization problem, given a set of linear classifiers, which can effectively discriminate the object categories present in the image. Our decomposition bypasses harder problems associated with accurately localizing and segmenting objects. We evaluate our method on a wide variety of composite histograms, and also compare it with MRF-based solutions. In addition to merely measuring the accuracy of decomposition, we also show the utility of the estimated object and background histograms for the task of image classification on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.</p><p>4 0.13230595 <a title="292-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Group_Norm_for_Learning_Structured_SVMs_with_Unstructured_Latent_Variables.html">187 iccv-2013-Group Norm for Learning Structured SVMs with Unstructured Latent Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Daozheng Chen, Dhruv Batra, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: Latent variables models have been applied to a number of computer vision problems. However, the complexity of the latent space is typically left as a free design choice. A larger latent space results in a more expressive model, but such models are prone to overfitting and are slower to perform inference with. The goal of this paper is to regularize the complexity of the latent space and learn which hidden states are really relevant for prediction. Specifically, we propose using group-sparsity-inducing regularizers such as ?1-?2 to estimate the parameters of Structured SVMs with unstructured latent variables.

Costeira, Alexandre Bernardino</p><p>Abstract: Low rank models have been widely usedfor the representation of shape, appearance or motion in computer vision problems. Traditional approaches to fit low rank models make use of an explicit bilinear factorization. These approaches benefit from fast numerical methods for optimization and easy kernelization. However, they suffer from serious local minima problems depending on the loss function and the amount/type of missing data. Recently, these lowrank models have alternatively been formulated as convex problems using the nuclear norm regularizer; unlike factorization methods, their numerical solvers are slow and it is unclear how to kernelize them or to impose a rank a priori. This paper proposes a unified approach to bilinear factorization and nuclear norm regularization, that inherits the benefits of both. We analyze the conditions under which these approaches are equivalent. Moreover, based on this analysis, we propose a new optimization algorithm and a “rank continuation ” strategy that outperform state-of-theart approaches for Robust PCA, Structure from Motion and Photometric Stereo with outliers and missing data.</p><p>6 0.10066897 <a title="292-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Coupled_Feature_Spaces_for_Cross-Modal_Matching.html">235 iccv-2013-Learning Coupled Feature Spaces for Cross-Modal Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Wangmeng Zuo, Deyu Meng, Lei Zhang, Xiangchu Feng, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In many sparse coding based image restoration and image classification problems, using non-convex ?p-norm minimization (0 ≤ p < 1) can often obtain better results than timhei convex 0?1 -norm m 1)ini camniza otfiteonn. Ab naiunm bbeetrt of algorithms, e.g., iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), iteratively thresholding method (ITM-?p), and look-up table (LUT), have been proposed for non-convex ?p-norm sparse coding, while some analytic solutions have been suggested for some specific values of p. In this paper, by extending the popular soft-thresholding operator, we propose a generalized iterated shrinkage algorithm (GISA) for ?p-norm non-convex sparse coding. Unlike the analytic solutions, the proposed GISA algorithm is easy to implement, and can be adopted for solving non-convex sparse coding problems with arbitrary p values. Compared with LUT, GISA is more general and does not need to compute and store the look-up tables. Compared with IRLS and ITM-?p, GISA is theoretically more solid and can achieve more accurate solutions. Experiments on image restoration and sparse coding based face recognition are conducted to validate the performance of GISA. ××</p><p>3 0.73999721 <a title="292-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Unifying_Nuclear_Norm_and_Bilinear_Factorization_Approaches_for_Low-Rank_Matrix_Decomposition.html">434 iccv-2013-Unifying Nuclear Norm and Bilinear Factorization Approaches for Low-Rank Matrix Decomposition</a></p>

<p>Author: Tae-Hyun Oh, Hyeongwoo Kim, Yu-Wing Tai, Jean-Charles Bazin, In So Kweon</p><p>Abstract: Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) via rank minimization is a powerful tool for recovering underlying low-rank structure of clean data corrupted with sparse noise/outliers. In many low-level vision problems, not only it is known that the underlying structure of clean data is low-rank, but the exact rank of clean data is also known. Yet, when applying conventional rank minimization for those problems, the objective function is formulated in a way that does not fully utilize a priori target rank information about the problems. This observation motivates us to investigate whether there is a better alternative solution when using rank minimization. In this paper, instead of minimizing the nuclear norm, we propose to minimize the partial sum of singular values. The proposed objective function implicitly encourages the target rank constraint in rank minimization. Our experimental analyses show that our approach performs better than conventional rank minimization when the number of samples is deficient, while the solutions obtained by the two approaches are almost identical when the number of samples is more than sufficient. We apply our approach to various low-level vision problems, e.g. high dynamic range imaging, photometric stereo and image alignment, and show that our results outperform those obtained by the conventional nuclear norm rank minimization method.</p><p>5 0.73267406 <a title="292-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-SGTD%3A_Structure_Gradient_and_Texture_Decorrelating_Regularization_for_Image_Decomposition.html">364 iccv-2013-SGTD: Structure Gradient and Texture Decorrelating Regularization for Image Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiegen Liu, Jianbo Liu, Pei Dong, Dong Liang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel structure gradient and texture decorrelating regularization (SGTD) for image decomposition. The motivation of the idea is under the assumption that the structure gradient and texture components should be properly decorrelated for a successful decomposition. The proposed model consists of the data fidelity term, total variation regularization and the SGTD regularization. An augmented Lagrangian method is proposed to address this optimization issue, by first transforming the unconstrained problem to an equivalent constrained problem and then applying an alternating direction method to iteratively solve the subproblems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method presents better or comparable performance as state-of-the-art methods do.</p><p>6 0.71887386 <a title="292-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Elastic_Net_Constraints_for_Shape_Matching.html">140 iccv-2013-Elastic Net Constraints for Shape Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Zuzana Kukelova, Martin Bujnak, Tomas Pajdla</p><p>Abstract: Theproblem ofdetermining the absoluteposition andorientation of a camera from a set of 2D-to-3D point correspondences is one of the most important problems in computer vision with a broad range of applications. In this paper we present a new solution to the absolute pose problem for camera with unknown radial distortion and unknown focal length from five 2D-to-3D point correspondences. Our new solver is numerically more stable, more accurate, and significantly faster than the existing state-of-the-art minimal fourpoint absolutepose solvers for this problem. Moreover, our solver results in less solutions and can handle larger radial distortions. The new solver is straightforward and uses only simple concepts from linear algebra. Therefore it is simpler than the state-of-the-art Gr¨ obner basis solvers. We compare our new solver with the existing state-of-theart solvers and show its usefulness on synthetic and real datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.71886116 <a title="292-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Partial_Sum_Minimization_of_Singular_Values_in_RPCA_for_Low-Level_Vision.html">310 iccv-2013-Partial Sum Minimization of Singular Values in RPCA for Low-Level Vision</a></p>

In this paper, for vocabulary tree based image retrieval, we propose a semantic-aware co-indexing algorithm to jointly San Antonio, TX 78249 . j dl@gmai l com qit ian@cs .ut sa . edu . The query embed two strong cues into the inverted indexes: 1) local invariant features that are robust to delineate low-level image contents, and 2) semantic attributes from large-scale object recognition that may reveal image semantic meanings. For an initial set of inverted indexes of local features, we utilize 1000 semantic attributes to filter out isolated images and insert semantically similar images to the initial set. Encoding these two distinct cues together effectively enhances the discriminative capability of inverted indexes. Such co-indexing operations are totally off-line and introduce small computation overhead to online query cause only local features but no semantic attributes are used for query.

<p>Author: Zhenyu Guo, Z. Jane Wang</p><p>Abstract: Digital images nowadays show large appearance variabilities on picture styles, in terms of color tone, contrast, vignetting, and etc. These ‘picture styles’ are directly related to the scene radiance, image pipeline of the camera, and post processing functions (e.g., photography effect filters). Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of these factors, popular gradient-based image descriptors generally are not invariant to different picture styles, which could degrade the performance for object recognition. Given that images shared online or created by individual users are taken with a wide range of devices and may be processed by various post processing functions, to find a robust object recognition system is useful and challenging. In this paper, we investigate the influence of picture styles on object recognition by making a connection between image descriptors and a pixel mapping function g, and accordingly propose an adaptive approach based on a g-incorporated kernel descriptor and multiple kernel learning, without estimating or specifying the image styles used in training and testing. We conduct experiments on the Domain Adaptation data set, the Oxford Flower data set, and several variants of the Flower data set by introducing popular photography effects through post-processing. The results demonstrate that theproposedmethod consistently yields recognition improvements over standard descriptors in all studied cases.</p><p>6 0.66289055 <a title="292-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Transfer_Feature_Learning_with_Joint_Distribution_Adaptation.html">427 iccv-2013-Transfer Feature Learning with Joint Distribution Adaptation</a></p>

</p><p>8 Introduction How to select a proper distance metric is a key problem in pattern classification, while the optimal distance metric for a specific pattern classification task depends on the underlying data structure and distributions. [sent-12, score-0.697]
</p><p>9 In recent years, it has been increasingly popular to learn a desired distance metric from the given training samples in many visual classification tasks, such as face/action/kinship verification [14], visual tracking [18], and image retrieval [1]. [sent-13, score-0.429]
</p><p>10 Metric learning methods can be categorized into unsupervised [9], semi-supervised [3] and supervised ones [14, 18, 1], according to the availability of the class labels of training samples. [sent-14, score-0.108]
</p><p>11 In general, metric learning aims to learn a valid distance ∗Corresponding author metric, measured by which the samples from the positive sample pair (i. [sent-15, score-0.557]
</p><p>12 , samples with the same class label or similar samples) could be as close as possible, while the samples from the negative sample pair (i. [sent-17, score-0.34]
</p><p>13 , samples with the different class labels or dissimilar samples) could be as far as possible. [sent-19, score-0.111]
</p><p>14 In some cases, only positive pairs are used in metric learning [14]. [sent-21, score-0.312]
</p><p>15 In [27], metric learning is formulated as a kernel classification model and the relations with LMNN and ITML are discussed. [sent-22, score-0.287]
</p><p>16 Metric learning algorithms have also been developed for multi-task learning [24], multiple instance learning [15] and nonlinear metrics [19]. [sent-23, score-0.147]
</p><p>17 Currently, almost all the metric learning methods focus on the learning of a point-to-point distance (PPD) metric in couple with the nearest neighbor classifier (NNC). [sent-24, score-0.691]
</p><p>18 , face recognition), however, we need to measure the distance between an image (i. [sent-27, score-0.117]
</p><p>19 In video based recognition tasks [29] or multi-view object recognition [20], we even need to measure the distance between two image sets. [sent-32, score-0.117]
</p><p>20 Therefore, it is highly desired to design effective point-to-set distance (PSD) and set-to-set distance (SSD) metric learning methods. [sent-33, score-0.5]
</p><p>21 Unfortunately, many PPD metric learning methods cannot be readily applied to PSD and SSD based classification. [sent-34, score-0.244]
</p><p>22 A set is often modeled as a hull, a convex hull (CH), or an affine hull (AH), and PSD can then be defined as the distance from a point to this hull. [sent-35, score-0.863]
</p><p>23 Correspondingly, the nearest subspace classifier (NSC), nearest convex hull classifier (NCH) [26], and nearest convex affine classifier (NAH) [26] are proposed for PSD based classification. [sent-36, score-0.747]
</p><p>24 In [6], a set is  modeled as a bounding hyperdisk (the set formed by intersecting their affine hull and their smallest bounding hypersphere), and a nearest hyperdisk classifier (NHD) is pro2664  posed for classification [6]. [sent-37, score-0.678]
</p><p>25 Given a query sample, those PSD based classifiers (NSC, NCH, NAH and NHD) compute its distance to each class, i. [sent-38, score-0.201]
</p><p>26 , the PSD between the query samples and the set of templates of this class, and classify it to the class with the minimal point-to-set distance. [sent-40, score-0.218]
</p><p>27 In [30], an image to class distance is learned in a multi-task way by considering each class as one task. [sent-41, score-0.235]
</p><p>28 In [36], an image to class distance is defined by minimizing the distance over all possible object configurations and all possible object matchings, and then the distance function parameters are learned. [sent-42, score-0.41]
</p><p>29 The work in [30] and [36] both focus on a special image to class distance rather than a general point to set distance. [sent-43, score-0.176]
</p><p>30 In [5], by modeling each set as a CH/AH, the CH/AH based image set distance (CHISD/AHISD) is defined. [sent-45, score-0.117]
</p><p>31 In [16], sparsity is imposed on the AH model and a sparse approximation nearest points (SANP) method is proposed for image set classification. [sent-46, score-0.079]
</p><p>32 In [35], a regularized affine hull (RAH) is proposed to model a set, and the SSD is defined between two RAHs. [sent-47, score-0.414]
</p><p>33 In [34], each set is represented by a linear subspace and the angles between two subspaces are utilized to measure the similarity of two sets. [sent-48, score-0.029]
</p><p>34 In [29], an image set is modeled as a manifold and a manifold-to-manifold distance (MMD) is proposed. [sent-50, score-0.144]
</p><p>35 After calculating the distance from the query set to each template set, those SSD based classifiers classify the query set to the class with the minimal set-to-set distance. [sent-51, score-0.401]
</p><p>36 To introduce discriminative information to SSD, projection matrix is learned in a large margin manner, e. [sent-52, score-0.051]
</p><p>37 , discriminative canonical correlation (DCC) [20] and manifold discriminant analysis (MDA) [28]. [sent-54, score-0.029]
</p><p>38 In [32], a set based discriminative ranking model is proposed by iterating between SSD finding and discriminative feature space projection. [sent-55, score-0.058]
</p><p>39 PSD (left) and SSD (right) Metric learning Inspired by the success of metric learning in PPD based classification, the performance of PSD and SSD based classification can also be boosted by metric learning. [sent-57, score-0.531]
</p><p>40 1(a), the query image y (represented as a red dot) has the same class label as template set X1 (represented as a red hull) but it will be misclassified since it has a closer PSD to set X2. [sent-59, score-0.207]
</p><p>41 If a proper metric learning method can be developed, it is possible that with the new distance metric, the PSD between y and X1 is smaller than that between y and X2, and consequently y can be correctly classified, as shown in the bottom part of Fig. [sent-60, score-0.391]
</p><p>42 Similar anticipation goes to the metric learning of SSD based classification, as illustrated in Fig. [sent-62, score-0.244]
</p><p>43 1(b), where the query set Y can be correctly classified with some proper SSD based distance metric. [sent-63, score-0.255]
</p><p>44 With the above considerations, in this paper we propose two novel metric learning models, PSD metric learning (PSDML) and SSD metric learning (SSDML), to enhance the performance of PSD and SSD based classification. [sent-64, score-0.753]
</p><p>45 One image (or image set) and one similarly labeled image set construct a positive pair, while one image (or image set) and one differently labeled set construct a negative pair. [sent-65, score-0.073]
</p><p>46 Then the PSDML and SSDML problems are formulated as a sample pair classification problem. [sent-66, score-0.152]
</p><p>47 Each sample pair is characterized by the covariance matrix of its two samples, and a covariance kernel is introduced. [sent-67, score-0.249]
</p><p>48 A discriminative function is then proposed for sample pair classification, and finally the PSDML and SSDML can be solved by using an SVM model. [sent-68, score-0.138]
</p><p>49 The proposed PSDML and SSDML methods can effectively improve the performance of PSD and SSD based classification, and are much more efficient than state-of-the-  art metric learning methods. [sent-69, score-0.244]

This problem is challenging and difficult due to the large variations in face images. In this paper, we develop a novel regularization framework to learn similarity metrics for unconstrained face verification. We formulate its objective function by incorporating the robustness to the large intra-personal variations and the discriminative power of novel similarity metrics. In addition, our formulation is a convex optimization problem which guarantees the existence of its global solution. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on the challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) database [10].</p><p>3 0.12537494 <a title="177-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Large-Scale_Image_Annotation_by_Efficient_and_Robust_Kernel_Metric_Learning.html">227 iccv-2013-Large-Scale Image Annotation by Efficient and Robust Kernel Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Zheyun Feng, Rong Jin, Anil Jain</p><p>Abstract: One of the key challenges in search-based image annotation models is to define an appropriate similarity measure between images. Many kernel distance metric learning (KML) algorithms have been developed in order to capture the nonlinear relationships between visual features and semantics ofthe images. Onefundamental limitation in applying KML to image annotation is that it requires converting image annotations into binary constraints, leading to a significant information loss. In addition, most KML algorithms suffer from high computational cost due to the requirement that the learned matrix has to be positive semi-definitive (PSD). In this paper, we propose a robust kernel metric learning (RKML) algorithm based on the regression technique that is able to directly utilize image annotations. The proposed method is also computationally more efficient because PSD property is automatically ensured by regression. We provide the theoretical guarantee for the proposed algorithm, and verify its efficiency and effectiveness for image annotation by comparing it to state-of-the-art approaches for both distance metric learning and image annotation. ,</p><p>4 0.10719197 <a title="177-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Stacked_Predictive_Sparse_Coding_for_Classification_of_Distinct_Regions_in_Tumor_Histopathology.html">401 iccv-2013-Stacked Predictive Sparse Coding for Classification of Distinct Regions in Tumor Histopathology</a></p>
<p>Author: Hang Chang, Yin Zhou, Paul Spellman, Bahram Parvin</p><p>Abstract: Image-based classification ofhistology sections, in terms of distinct components (e.g., tumor, stroma, normal), provides a series of indices for tumor composition. Furthermore, aggregation of these indices, from each whole slide image (WSI) in a large cohort, can provide predictive models of the clinical outcome. However, performance of the existing techniques is hindered as a result of large technical variations and biological heterogeneities that are always present in a large cohort. We propose a system that automatically learns a series of basis functions for representing the underlying spatial distribution using stacked predictive sparse decomposition (PSD). The learned representation is then fed into the spatial pyramid matching framework (SPM) with a linear SVM classifier. The system has been evaluated for classification of (a) distinct histological components for two cohorts of tumor types, and (b) colony organization of normal and malignant cell lines in 3D cell culture models. Throughput has been increased through the utility of graphical processing unit (GPU), and evalu- ation indicates a superior performance results, compared with previous research.</p><p>5 0.10064779 <a title="177-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Affine-Constrained_Group_Sparse_Coding_and_Its_Application_to_Image-Based_Classifications.html">45 iccv-2013-Affine-Constrained Group Sparse Coding and Its Application to Image-Based Classifications</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu-Tseh Chi, Mohsen Ali, Muhammad Rushdi, Jeffrey Ho</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for sparse coding that further improves upon the sparse representation-based classification (SRC) framework. The proposed framework, Affine-Constrained Group Sparse Coding (ACGSC), extends the current SRC framework to classification problems with multiple input samples. Geometrically, the affineconstrained group sparse coding essentially searches for the vector in the convex hull spanned by the input vectors that can best be sparse coded using the given dictionary. The resulting objectivefunction is still convex and can be efficiently optimized using iterative block-coordinate descent scheme that is guaranteed to converge. Furthermore, we provide a form of sparse recovery result that guarantees, at least theoretically, that the classification performance of the constrained group sparse coding should be at least as good as the group sparse coding. We have evaluated the proposed approach using three different recognition experiments that involve illumination variation of faces and textures, and face recognition under occlusions. Prelimi- nary experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and in particular, the results from the recognition/occlusion experiment are surprisingly accurate and robust.</p><p>6 0.093865998 <a title="177-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Face_Recognition_via_Archetype_Hull_Ranking.html">154 iccv-2013-Face Recognition via Archetype Hull Ranking</a></p>

Finally, we tackle the PSDML and SSDMLproblems by using standard support vector machine solvers, making the metric learning very efficient for multiclass visual classification tasks. Experiments on gender classification, digit recognition, object categorization and face recognition show that the proposed metric learning methods can effectively enhance the performance of PSD and SSD based classification.</p><p>2 0.83248049 <a title="177-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-Large-Scale_Image_Annotation_by_Efficient_and_Robust_Kernel_Metric_Learning.html">227 iccv-2013-Large-Scale Image Annotation by Efficient and Robust Kernel Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Zheyun Feng, Rong Jin, Anil Jain</p><p>Abstract: One of the key challenges in search-based image annotation models is to define an appropriate similarity measure between images. Many kernel distance metric learning (KML) algorithms have been developed in order to capture the nonlinear relationships between visual features and semantics ofthe images. Onefundamental limitation in applying KML to image annotation is that it requires converting image annotations into binary constraints, leading to a significant information loss. In addition, most KML algorithms suffer from high computational cost due to the requirement that the learned matrix has to be positive semi-definitive (PSD). In this paper, we propose a robust kernel metric learning (RKML) algorithm based on the regression technique that is able to directly utilize image annotations. The proposed method is also computationally more efficient because PSD property is automatically ensured by regression. We provide the theoretical guarantee for the proposed algorithm, and verify its efficiency and effectiveness for image annotation by comparing it to state-of-the-art approaches for both distance metric learning and image annotation. ,</p><p>3 0.8277787 <a title="177-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Learning_of_Discriminative_Prototypes_and_Large_Margin_Nearest_Neighbor_Classifiers.html">222 iccv-2013-Joint Learning of Discriminative Prototypes and Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Köstinger, Paul Wohlhart, Peter M. Roth, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we raise important issues concerning the evaluation complexity of existing Mahalanobis metric learning methods. The complexity scales linearly with the size of the dataset. This is especially cumbersome on large scale or for real-time applications with limited time budget. To alleviate this problem we propose to represent the dataset by a fixed number of discriminative prototypes. In particular, we introduce a new method that jointly chooses the positioning of prototypes and also optimizes the Mahalanobis distance metric with respect to these. We show that choosing the positioning of the prototypes and learning the metric in parallel leads to a drastically reduced evaluation effort while maintaining the discriminative essence of the original dataset. Moreover, for most problems our method performing k-nearest prototype (k-NP) classification on the condensed dataset leads to even better generalization compared to k-NN classification using all data. Results on a variety of challenging benchmarks demonstrate the power of our method. These include standard machine learning datasets as well as the challenging Public Fig- ures Face Database. On the competitive machine learning benchmarks we are comparable to the state-of-the-art while being more efficient. On the face benchmark we clearly outperform the state-of-the-art in Mahalanobis metric learning with drastically reduced evaluation effort.</p><p>4 0.78244394 <a title="177-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Set_Classification_Using_Holistic_Multiple_Order_Statistics_Features_and_Localized_Multi-kernel_Metric_Learning.html">212 iccv-2013-Image Set Classification Using Holistic Multiple Order Statistics Features and Localized Multi-kernel Metric Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiwen Lu, Gang Wang, Pierre Moulin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for image set classification, where each training and testing example contains a set of image instances of an object captured from varying viewpoints or under varying illuminations. While a number of image set classification methods have been proposed in recent years, most of them model each image set as a single linear subspace or mixture of linear subspaces, which may lose some discriminative information for classification. To address this, we propose exploring multiple order statistics as features of image sets, and develop a localized multikernel metric learning (LMKML) algorithm to effectively combine different order statistics information for classification. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four widely used databases including the Honda/UCSD, CMU Mobo, and Youtube face datasets, and the ETH-80 object dataset.</p><p>5 0.72732997 <a title="177-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Novel_Earth_Mover%27s_Distance_Methodology_for_Image_Matching_with_Gaussian_Mixture_Models.html">25 iccv-2013-A Novel Earth Mover's Distance Methodology for Image Matching with Gaussian Mixture Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Peihua Li, Qilong Wang, Lei Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The similarity or distance measure between Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) plays a crucial role in contentbased image matching. Though the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) has shown its advantages in matching histogram features, its potentials in matching GMMs remain unclear and are not fully explored. To address this problem, we propose a novel EMD methodology for GMM matching. We ?rst present a sparse representation based EMD called SR-EMD by exploiting the sparse property of the underlying problem. SR-EMD is more ef?cient and robust than the conventional EMD. Second, we present two novel ground distances between component Gaussians based on the information geometry. The perspective from the Riemannian geometry distinguishes the proposed ground distances from the classical entropy- or divergence-based ones. Furthermore, motivated by the success of distance metric learning of vector data, we make the ?rst attempt to learn the EMD distance metrics between GMMs by using a simple yet effective supervised pair-wise based method. It can adapt the distance metrics between GMMs to speci?c classi?ca- tion tasks. The proposed method is evaluated on both simulated data and benchmark real databases and achieves very promising performance.</p><p>6 0.72366196 <a title="177-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Similarity_Metric_Learning_for_Face_Recognition.html">392 iccv-2013-Similarity Metric Learning for Face Recognition</a></p>

The recently proposed PatchMatch stereo algorithm [7] overcomes this limitation of previous algorithms by directly estimating planes. This work presents a method that integrates the PatchMatch stereo algorithm into a variational smoothing formulation using quadratic relaxation. The resulting algorithm allows the explicit regularization of the disparity and normal gradients using the estimated plane parameters. Evaluation of our method in the Middlebury benchmark shows that our method outperforms the traditional integer-valued disparity strategy as well as the original algorithm and its variants in sub-pixel accurate disparity estimation.</p><p>3 0.58280754 <a title="177-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Global_Linear_Method_for_Camera_Pose_Registration.html">17 iccv-2013-A Global Linear Method for Camera Pose Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Nianjuan Jiang, Zhaopeng Cui, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We present a linear method for global camera pose registration from pairwise relative poses encoded in essential matrices. Our method minimizes an approximate geometric error to enforce the triangular relationship in camera triplets. This formulation does not suffer from the typical ‘unbalanced scale ’ problem in linear methods relying on pairwise translation direction constraints, i.e. an algebraic error; nor the system degeneracy from collinear motion. In the case of three cameras, our method provides a good linear approximation of the trifocal tensor. It can be directly scaled up to register multiple cameras. The results obtained are accurate for point triangulation and can serve as a good initialization for final bundle adjustment. We evaluate the algorithm performance with different types of data and demonstrate its effectiveness. Our system produces good accuracy, robustness, and outperforms some well-known systems on efficiency.</p><p>4 0.58249426 <a title="177-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-DCSH_-_Matching_Patches_in_RGBD_Images.html">101 iccv-2013-DCSH - Matching Patches in RGBD Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Yaron Eshet, Simon Korman, Eyal Ofek, Shai Avidan</p><p>Abstract: We extend patch based methods to work on patches in 3D space. We start with Coherency Sensitive Hashing [12] (CSH), which is an algorithm for matching patches between two RGB images, and extend it to work with RGBD images. This is done by warping all 3D patches to a common virtual plane in which CSH is performed. To avoid noise due to warping of patches of various normals and depths, we estimate a group of dominant planes and compute CSH on each plane separately, before merging the matching patches. The result is DCSH - an algorithm that matches world (3D) patches in order to guide the search for image plane matches. An independent contribution is an extension of CSH, which we term Social-CSH. It allows a major speedup of the k nearest neighbor (kNN) version of CSH - its runtime growing linearly, rather than quadratically, in k. Social-CSH is used as a subcomponent of DCSH when many NNs are required, as in the case of image denoising. We show the benefits ofusing depth information to image reconstruction and image denoising, demonstrated on several RGBD images.</p><p>5 0.57863808 <a title="177-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Group_Sparsity_and_Geometry_Constrained_Dictionary_Learning_for_Action_Recognition_from_Depth_Maps.html">188 iccv-2013-Group Sparsity and Geometry Constrained Dictionary Learning for Action Recognition from Depth Maps</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiajia Luo, Wei Wang, Hairong Qi</p><p>Abstract: Human action recognition based on the depth information provided by commodity depth sensors is an important yet challenging task. The noisy depth maps, different lengths of action sequences, and free styles in performing actions, may cause large intra-class variations. In this paper, a new framework based on sparse coding and temporal pyramid matching (TPM) is proposed for depthbased human action recognition. Especially, a discriminative class-specific dictionary learning algorithm isproposed for sparse coding. By adding the group sparsity and geometry constraints, features can be well reconstructed by the sub-dictionary belonging to the same class, and the geometry relationships among features are also kept in the calculated coefficients. The proposed approach is evaluated on two benchmark datasets captured by depth cameras.

<p>Author: Qifeng Chen, Vladlen Koltun</p><p>Abstract: We present a model for intrinsic decomposition of RGB-D images. Our approach analyzes a single RGB-D image and estimates albedo and shading fields that explain the input. To disambiguate the problem, our model estimates a number of components that jointly account for the reconstructed shading. By decomposing the shading field, we can build in assumptions about image formation that help distinguish reflectance variation from shading. These assumptions are expressed as simple nonlocal regularizers. We evaluate the model on real-world images and on a challenging synthetic dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms prior models for intrinsic decomposition of RGB-D images.</p><p>3 0.28903773 <a title="199-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Normal_Field_Integration_for_3D_Reconstruction_of_Mirroring_Objects.html">281 iccv-2013-Multi-view Normal Field Integration for 3D Reconstruction of Mirroring Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Weinmann, Aljosa Osep, Roland Ruiters, Reinhard Klein</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel, robust multi-view normal field integration technique for reconstructing the full 3D shape of mirroring objects. We employ a turntablebased setup with several cameras and displays. These are used to display illumination patterns which are reflected by the object surface. The pattern information observed in the cameras enables the calculation of individual volumetric normal fields for each combination of camera, display and turntable angle. As the pattern information might be blurred depending on the surface curvature or due to nonperfect mirroring surface characteristics, we locally adapt the decoding to the finest still resolvable pattern resolution. In complex real-world scenarios, the normal fields contain regions without observations due to occlusions and outliers due to interreflections and noise. Therefore, a robust reconstruction using only normal information is challenging. Via a non-parametric clustering of normal hypotheses derived for each point in the scene, we obtain both the most likely local surface normal and a local surface consistency estimate. This information is utilized in an iterative mincut based variational approach to reconstruct the surface geometry.</p><p>4 0.27540618 <a title="199-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Multiview_Photometric_Stereo_Using_Planar_Mesh_Parameterization.html">284 iccv-2013-Multiview Photometric Stereo Using Planar Mesh Parameterization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaesik Park, Sudipta N. Sinha, Yasuyuki Matsushita, Yu-Wing Tai, In So Kweon</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for accurate 3D shape reconstruction using uncalibrated multiview photometric stereo. A coarse mesh reconstructed using multiview stereo is first parameterized using a planar mesh parameterization technique. Subsequently, multiview photometric stereo is performed in the 2D parameter domain of the mesh, where all geometric and photometric cues from multiple images can be treated uniformly. Unlike traditional methods, there is no need for merging view-dependent surface normal maps. Our key contribution is a new photometric stereo based mesh refinement technique that can efficiently reconstruct meshes with extremely fine geometric details by directly estimating a displacement texture map in the 2D parameter domain. We demonstrate that intricate surface geometry can be reconstructed using several challenging datasets containing surfaces with specular reflections, multiple albedos and complex topologies.</p><p>5 0.24278963 <a title="199-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Structured_Light_in_Sunlight.html">405 iccv-2013-Structured Light in Sunlight</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohit Gupta, Qi Yin, Shree K. Nayar</p><p>Abstract: Strong ambient illumination severely degrades the performance of structured light based techniques. This is especially true in outdoor scenarios, where the structured light sources have to compete with sunlight, whose power is often 2-5 orders of magnitude larger than the projected light. In this paper, we propose the concept of light-concentration to overcome strong ambient illumination. Our key observation is that given a fixed light (power) budget, it is always better to allocate it sequentially in several portions of the scene, as compared to spreading it over the entire scene at once. For a desired level of accuracy, we show that by distributing light appropriately, the proposed approach requires 1-2 orders lower acquisition time than existing approaches. Our approach is illumination-adaptive as the optimal light distribution is determined based on a measurement of the ambient illumination level. Since current light sources have a fixed light distribution, we have built a prototype light source that supports flexible light distribution by controlling the scanning speed of a laser scanner. We show several high quality 3D scanning results in a wide range of outdoor scenarios. The proposed approach will benefit 3D vision systems that need to operate outdoors under extreme ambient illumination levels on a limited time and power budget.</p><p>6 0.23324235 <a title="199-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Internet_Based_Morphable_Model.html">219 iccv-2013-Internet Based Morphable Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Ying Fu, Antony Lam, Imari Sato, Takahiro Okabe, Yoichi Sato</p><p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging is beneficial to many applications but current methods do not consider fluorescent effects which are present in everyday items ranging from paper, to clothing, to even our food. Furthermore, everyday fluorescent items exhibit a mix of reflectance and fluorescence. So proper separation of these components is necessary for analyzing them. In this paper, we demonstrate efficient separation and recovery of reflective and fluorescent emission spectra through the use of high frequency illumination in the spectral domain. With the obtained fluorescent emission spectra from our high frequency illuminants, we then present to our knowledge, the first method for estimating the fluorescent absorption spectrum of a material given its emission spectrum. Conventional bispectral measurement of absorption and emission spectra needs to examine all combinations of incident and observed light wavelengths. In contrast, our method requires only two hyperspectral images. The effectiveness of our proposed methods are then evaluated through a combination of simulation and real experiments. We also demonstrate an application of our method to synthetic relighting of real scenes.</p><p>5 0.7378841 <a title="199-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Illuminant_Chromaticity_from_Image_Sequences.html">207 iccv-2013-Illuminant Chromaticity from Image Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Veronique Prinet, Dani Lischinski, Michael Werman</p><p>Abstract: We estimate illuminant chromaticity from temporal sequences, for scenes illuminated by either one or two dominant illuminants. While there are many methods for illuminant estimation from a single image, few works so far have focused on videos, and even fewer on multiple light sources. Our aim is to leverage information provided by the temporal acquisition, where either the objects or the camera or the light source are/is in motion in order to estimate illuminant color without the need for user interaction or using strong assumptions and heuristics. We introduce a simple physically-based formulation based on the assumption that the incident light chromaticity is constant over a short space-time domain. We show that a deterministic approach is not sufficient for accurate and robust estimation: however, a probabilistic formulation makes it possible to implicitly integrate away hidden factors that have been ignored by the physical model. Experimental results are reported on a dataset of natural video sequences and on the GrayBall benchmark, indicating that we compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.71212035 <a title="199-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Multiview_Photometric_Stereo_Using_Planar_Mesh_Parameterization.html">284 iccv-2013-Multiview Photometric Stereo Using Planar Mesh Parameterization</a></p>

<p>Author: Dingzeyu Li, Qifeng Chen, Chi-Keung Tang</p><p>Abstract: This paper demonstrates how the nonlocal principle benefits video matting via the KNN Laplacian, which comes with a straightforward implementation using motionaware K nearest neighbors. In hindsight, the fundamental problem to solve in video matting is to produce spatiotemporally coherent clusters of moving foreground pixels. When used as described, the motion-aware KNN Laplacian is effective in addressing this fundamental problem, as demonstrated by sparse user markups typically on only one frame in a variety of challenging examples featuring ambiguous foreground and background colors, changing topologies with disocclusion, significant illumination changes, fast motion, and motion blur. When working with existing Laplacian-based systems, our Laplacian is expected to benefit them immediately with improved clustering of moving foreground pixels.</p><p>2 0.92397493 <a title="199-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Drosophila_Embryo_Stage_Annotation_Using_Label_Propagation.html">125 iccv-2013-Drosophila Embryo Stage Annotation Using Label Propagation</a></p>

While the system is designed to solve an actual problem in biological research, we believe that the principle underlying it is interesting not only for biologists, but also for researchers in computer vision. The main idea is to combine two orthogonal sources of information: one is a classifier trained on strongly invariant features, which makes it applicable to images of very different conditions, but also leads to rather noisy predictions. The other is a label propagation step based on a more powerful similarity measure that however is only consistent within specific subsets of the data at a time. In our biological setup, the information sources are the shape and the staining patterns of embryo images. We show experimentally that while neither of the methods can be used by itself to achieve satisfactory results, their combination achieves prediction quality comparable to human per- formance.</p><p>3 0.89166254 <a title="199-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Learning-Based_Approach_to_Reduce_JPEG_Artifacts_in_Image_Matting.html">19 iccv-2013-A Learning-Based Approach to Reduce JPEG Artifacts in Image Matting</a></p>
<p>Author: Inchang Choi, Sunyeong Kim, Michael S. Brown, Yu-Wing Tai</p><p>Abstract: Single image matting techniques assume high-quality input images. The vast majority of images on the web and in personal photo collections are encoded using JPEG compression. JPEG images exhibit quantization artifacts that adversely affect the performance of matting algorithms. To address this situation, we propose a learning-based post-processing method to improve the alpha mattes extracted from JPEG images. Our approach learns a set of sparse dictionaries from training examples that are used to transfer details from high-quality alpha mattes to alpha mattes corrupted by JPEG compression. Three different dictionaries are defined to accommodate different object structure (long hair, short hair, and sharp boundaries). A back-projection criteria combined within an MRF framework is used to automatically select the best dictionary to apply on the object’s local boundary. We demonstrate that our method can produces superior results over existing state-of-the-art matting algorithms on a variety of inputs and compression levels.</p><p>4 0.88794023 <a title="199-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Accurate_and_Robust_3D_Facial_Capture_Using_a_Single_RGBD_Camera.html">36 iccv-2013-Accurate and Robust 3D Facial Capture Using a Single RGBD Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Yen-Lin Chen, Hsiang-Tao Wu, Fuhao Shi, Xin Tong, Jinxiang Chai</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an automatic and robust approach that accurately captures high-quality 3D facial performances using a single RGBD camera. The key of our approach is to combine the power of automatic facial feature detection and image-based 3D nonrigid registration techniques for 3D facial reconstruction. In particular, we develop a robust and accurate image-based nonrigid registration algorithm that incrementally deforms a 3D template mesh model to best match observed depth image data and important facial features detected from single RGBD images. The whole process is fully automatic and robust because it is based on single frame facial registration framework. The system is flexible because it does not require any strong 3D facial priors such as blendshape models. We demonstrate the power of our approach by capturing a wide range of 3D facial expressions using a single RGBD camera and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy by comparing against alternative methods.</p><p>5 0.88613898 <a title="199-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Viewing_Real-World_Faces_in_3D.html">444 iccv-2013-Viewing Real-World Faces in 3D</a></p>
<p>Author: Tal Hassner</p><p>Abstract: We present a data-driven method for estimating the 3D shapes of faces viewed in single, unconstrained photos (aka “in-the-wild”). Our method was designed with an emphasis on robustness and efficiency with the explicit goal of deployment in real-world applications which reconstruct and display faces in 3D. Our key observation is that for many practical applications, warping the shape of a reference face to match the appearance of a query, is enough to produce realistic impressions of the query ’s 3D shape. Doing so, however, requires matching visual features between the (possibly very different) query and reference images, while ensuring that a plausible face shape is produced. To this end, we describe an optimization process which seeks to maximize the similarity of appearances and depths, jointly, to those of a reference model. We describe our system for monocular face shape reconstruction and present both qualitative and quantitative experiments, comparing our method against alternative systems, and demonstrating its capabilities. Finally, as a testament to its suitability for real-world applications, we offer an open, online implementation of our system, providing unique means – of instant 3D viewing of faces appearing in web photos.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.88444924 <a title="199-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-High_Quality_Shape_from_a_Single_RGB-D_Image_under_Uncalibrated_Natural_Illumination.html">199 iccv-2013-High Quality Shape from a Single RGB-D Image under Uncalibrated Natural Illumination</a></p>

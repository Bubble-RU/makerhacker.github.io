<p>Author: Naiyan Wang, Jingdong Wang, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the visual tracking problem in video sequences and presents a novel robust sparse tracker under the particle filter framework. In particular, we propose an online robust non-negative dictionary learning algorithm for updating the object templates so that each learned template can capture a distinctive aspect of the tracked object. Another appealing property of this approach is that it can automatically detect and reject the occlusion and cluttered background in a principled way. In addition, we propose a new particle representation formulation using the Huber loss function. The advantage is that it can yield robust estimation without using trivial templates adopted by previous sparse trackers, leading to faster computation. We also reveal the equivalence between this new formulation and the previous one which uses trivial templates. The proposed tracker is empirically compared with state-of-the-art trackers on some challenging video sequences. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons show that our proposed tracker is superior and more stable.</p><p>3 0.16071931 <a title="386-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Segmentation_and_Pose_Tracking_of_Human_in_Natural_Videos.html">225 iccv-2013-Joint Segmentation and Pose Tracking of Human in Natural Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Taegyu Lim, Seunghoon Hong, Bohyung Han, Joon Hee Han</p><p>Abstract: We propose an on-line algorithm to extract a human by foreground/background segmentation and estimate pose of the human from the videos captured by moving cameras. We claim that a virtuous cycle can be created by appropriate interactions between the two modules to solve individual problems. This joint estimation problem is divided into two subproblems, , foreground/background segmentation and pose tracking, which alternate iteratively for optimization; segmentation step generates foreground mask for human pose tracking, and human pose tracking step provides foreground response map for segmentation. The final solution is obtained when the iterative procedure converges. We evaluate our algorithm quantitatively and qualitatively in real videos involving various challenges, and present its outstandingperformance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques for segmentation and pose estimation.</p><p>4 0.13764511 <a title="386-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Tracking_via_Robust_Multi-task_Multi-view_Joint_Sparse_Representation.html">425 iccv-2013-Tracking via Robust Multi-task Multi-view Joint Sparse Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhibin Hong, Xue Mei, Danil Prokhorov, Dacheng Tao</p><p>Abstract: Combining multiple observation views has proven beneficial for tracking. In this paper, we cast tracking as a novel multi-task multi-view sparse learning problem and exploit the cues from multiple views including various types of visual features, such as intensity, color, and edge, where each feature observation can be sparsely represented by a linear combination of atoms from an adaptive feature dictionary. The proposed method is integrated in a particle filter framework where every view in each particle is regarded as an individual task. We jointly consider the underlying relationship between tasks across different views and different particles, and tackle it in a unified robust multi-task formulation. In addition, to capture the frequently emerging outlier tasks, we decompose the representation matrix to two collaborative components which enable a more robust and accurate approximation. We show that theproposedformulation can be efficiently solved using the Accelerated Proximal Gradient method with a small number of closed-form updates. The presented tracker is implemented using four types of features and is tested on numerous benchmark video sequences. Both the qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to several stateof-the-art trackers.</p><p>5 0.11963615 <a title="386-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Incorporating_Cloud_Distribution_in_Sky_Representation.html">215 iccv-2013-Incorporating Cloud Distribution in Sky Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kuan-Chuan Peng, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: Most sky models only describe the cloudiness ofthe overall sky by a single category or parameter such as sky index, which does not account for the distribution of the clouds across the sky. To capture variable cloudiness, we extend the concept of sky index to a random field indicating the level of cloudiness of each sky pixel in our proposed sky representation based on the Igawa sky model. We formulate the problem of solving the sky index of every sky pixel as a labeling problem, where an approximate solution can be efficiently found. Experimental results show that our proposed sky model has better expressiveness, stability with respect to variation in camera parameters, and geo-location estimation in outdoor images compared to the uniform sky index model. Potential applications of our proposed sky model include sky image rendering, where sky images can be generated with an arbitrary cloud distribution at any time and any location, previously impossible with traditional sky models.</p><p>6 0.11940907 <a title="386-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Slice_Sampling_Particle_Belief_Propagation.html">395 iccv-2013-Slice Sampling Particle Belief Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Oliver Müller, Michael Ying Yang, Bodo Rosenhahn</p><p>Abstract: Inference in continuous label Markov random fields is a challenging task. We use particle belief propagation (PBP) for solving the inference problem in continuous label space. Sampling particles from the belief distribution is typically done by using Metropolis-Hastings (MH) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods which involves sampling from a proposal distribution. This proposal distribution has to be carefully designed depending on the particular model and input data to achieve fast convergence. We propose to avoid dependence on a proposal distribution by introducing a slice sampling based PBP algorithm. The proposed approach shows superior convergence performance on an image denoising toy example. Our findings are validated on a challenging relational 2D feature tracking application.</p><p>3 0.69139254 <a title="386-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Incorporating_Cloud_Distribution_in_Sky_Representation.html">215 iccv-2013-Incorporating Cloud Distribution in Sky Representation</a></p>

<p>Author: Honghui Zhang, Jingdong Wang, Ping Tan, Jinglu Wang, Long Quan</p><p>Abstract: We propose an adaptive subgradient descent method to efficiently learn the parameters of CRF models for image parsing. To balance the learning efficiency and performance of the learned CRF models, the parameter learning is iteratively carried out by solving a convex optimization problem in each iteration, which integrates a proximal term to preserve the previously learned information and the large margin preference to distinguish bad labeling and the ground truth labeling. A solution of subgradient descent updating form is derived for the convex optimization problem, with an adaptively determined updating step-size. Besides, to deal with partially labeled training data, we propose a new objective constraint modeling both the labeled and unlabeled parts in the partially labeled training data for the parameter learning of CRF models. The superior learning efficiency of the proposed method is verified by the experiment results on two public datasets. We also demonstrate the powerfulness of our method for handling partially labeled training data.</p><p>5 0.64041573 <a title="386-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Structured_Forests_for_Fast_Edge_Detection.html">404 iccv-2013-Structured Forests for Fast Edge Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Piotr Dollár, C. Lawrence Zitnick</p><p>Abstract: Edge detection is a critical component of many vision systems, including object detectors and image segmentation algorithms. Patches of edges exhibit well-known forms of local structure, such as straight lines or T-junctions. In this paper we take advantage of the structure present in local image patches to learn both an accurate and computationally efficient edge detector. We formulate the problem of predicting local edge masks in a structured learning framework applied to random decision forests. Our novel approach to learning decision trees robustly maps the structured labels to a discrete space on which standard information gain measures may be evaluated. The result is an approach that obtains realtime performance that is orders of magnitude faster than many competing state-of-the-art approaches, while also achieving state-of-the-art edge detection results on the BSDS500 Segmentation dataset and NYU Depth dataset. Finally, we show the potential of our approach as a general purpose edge detector by showing our learned edge models generalize well across datasets.</p><p>6 0.63642412 <a title="386-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Structured_Model_Selection.html">130 iccv-2013-Dynamic Structured Model Selection</a></p>

<p>Author: Christoph Straehle, Ullrich Koethe, Fred A. Hamprecht</p><p>Abstract: We propose a scheme that allows to partition an image into a previously unknown number of segments, using only minimal supervision in terms of a few must-link and cannotlink annotations. We make no use of regional data terms, learning instead what constitutes a likely boundary between segments. Since boundaries are only implicitly specified through cannot-link constraints, this is a hard and nonconvex latent variable problem. We address this problem in a greedy fashion using a randomized decision tree on features associated with interpixel edges. We use a structured purity criterion during tree construction and also show how a backtracking strategy can be used to prevent the greedy search from ending up in poor local optima. The proposed strategy is compared with prior art on natural images.</p><p>2 0.90397865 <a title="386-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-A_Robust_Analytical_Solution_to_Isometric_Shape-from-Template_with_Focal_Length_Calibration.html">27 iccv-2013-A Robust Analytical Solution to Isometric Shape-from-Template with Focal Length Calibration</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrien Bartoli, Daniel Pizarro, Toby Collins</p><p>Abstract: We study the uncalibrated isometric Shape-fromTemplate problem, that consists in estimating an isometric deformation from a template shape to an input image whose focal length is unknown. Our method is the first that combines the following features: solving for both the 3D deformation and the camera ’s focal length, involving only local analytical solutions (there is no numerical optimization), being robust to mismatches, handling general surfaces and running extremely fast. This was achieved through two key steps. First, an ‘uncalibrated’ 3D deformation is computed thanks to a novel piecewise weak-perspective projection model. Second, the camera’s focal length is estimated and enables upgrading the 3D deformation to metric. We use a variational framework, implemented using a smooth function basis and sampled local deformation models. The only degeneracy which we easily detect– for focal length estimation is a flat and fronto-parallel surface. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets show that our method achieves a 3D shape accuracy – slightly below state of the art methods using a precalibrated or the true focal length, and a focal length accuracy slightly below static calibration methods.</p><p>3 0.90089548 <a title="386-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Event_Detection_in_Complex_Scenes_Using_Interval_Temporal_Constraints.html">146 iccv-2013-Event Detection in Complex Scenes Using Interval Temporal Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yifan Zhang, Qiang Ji, Hanqing Lu</p><p>Abstract: In complex scenes with multiple atomic events happening sequentially or in parallel, detecting each individual event separately may not always obtain robust and reliable result. It is essential to detect them in a holistic way which incorporates the causality and temporal dependency among them to compensate the limitation of current computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose an interval temporal constrained dynamic Bayesian network to extendAllen ’s interval algebra network (IAN) [2]from a deterministic static model to a probabilistic dynamic system, which can not only capture the complex interval temporal relationships, but also model the evolution dynamics and handle the uncertainty from the noisy visual observation. In the model, the topology of the IAN on each time slice and the interlinks between the time slices are discovered by an advanced structure learning method. The duration of the event and the unsynchronized time lags between two correlated event intervals are captured by a duration model, so that we can better determine the temporal boundary of the event. Empirical results on two real world datasets show the power of the proposed interval temporal constrained model.</p><p>4 0.89496374 <a title="386-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Slice_Sampling_Particle_Belief_Propagation.html">395 iccv-2013-Slice Sampling Particle Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Oliver Müller, Michael Ying Yang, Bodo Rosenhahn</p><p>Abstract: Inference in continuous label Markov random fields is a challenging task. We use particle belief propagation (PBP) for solving the inference problem in continuous label space. Sampling particles from the belief distribution is typically done by using Metropolis-Hastings (MH) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods which involves sampling from a proposal distribution. This proposal distribution has to be carefully designed depending on the particular model and input data to achieve fast convergence. We propose to avoid dependence on a proposal distribution by introducing a slice sampling based PBP algorithm. The proposed approach shows superior convergence performance on an image denoising toy example. Our findings are validated on a challenging relational 2D feature tracking application.</p><p>5 0.89276034 <a title="386-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Tree_Shape_Priors_with_Connectivity_Constraints_Using_Convex_Relaxation_on_General_Graphs.html">429 iccv-2013-Tree Shape Priors with Connectivity Constraints Using Convex Relaxation on General Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan Stühmer, Peter Schröder, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to include a connectivity prior into image segmentation that is based on a binary labeling of a directed graph, in this case a geodesic shortest path tree. Specifically we make two contributions: First, we construct a geodesic shortest path tree with a distance measure that is related to the image data and the bending energy of each path in the tree. Second, we include a connectivity prior in our segmentation model, that allows to segment not only a single elongated structure, but instead a whole connected branching tree. Because both our segmentation model and the connectivity constraint are convex, a global optimal solution can be found. To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure. To validate our method we present results on data from medical imaging in angiography and retinal blood vessel segmentation.</p><p>6 0.88776243 <a title="386-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Data_Association%3A_Bayesian_Model_Selection_for_Multi-target_Tracking.html">230 iccv-2013-Latent Data Association: Bayesian Model Selection for Multi-target Tracking</a></p>

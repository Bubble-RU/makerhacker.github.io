<p>Author: Georgios Tzimiropoulos, Maja Pantic</p><p>Abstract: We describe a very simple framework for deriving the most-well known optimization problems in Active Appearance Models (AAMs), and most importantly for providing efficient solutions. Our formulation results in two optimization problems for fast and exact AAM fitting, and one new algorithm which has the important advantage of being applicable to 3D. We show that the dominant cost for both forward and inverse algorithms is a few times mN which is the cost of projecting an image onto the appearance subspace. This makes both algorithms not only computationally realizable but also very attractive speed-wise for most current systems. Because exact AAM fitting is no longer computationally prohibitive, we trained AAMs in-the-wild with the goal of investigating whether AAMs benefit from such a training process. Our results show that although we did not use sophisticated shape priors, robust features or robust norms for improving performance, AAMs perform notably well and in some cases comparably with current state-ofthe-art methods.

<p>Author: Xiaowei Zhao, Shiguang Shan, Xiujuan Chai, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel cascaded face shape space pruning algorithm for robust facial landmark detection. Through progressively excluding the incorrect candidate shapes, our algorithm can accurately and efficiently achieve the globally optimal shape configuration. Specifically, individual landmark detectors are firstly applied to eliminate wrong candidates for each landmark. Then, the candidate shape space is further pruned by jointly removing incorrect shape configurations. To achieve this purpose, a discriminative structure classifier is designed to assess the candidate shape configurations. Based on the learned discriminative structure classifier, an efficient shape space pruning strategy is proposed to quickly reject most incorrect candidate shapes while preserve the true shape. The proposed algorithm is carefully evaluated on a large set of real world face images. In addition, comparison results on the publicly available BioID and LFW face databases demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><p>4 0.17730057 <a title="339-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Pose-Free_Facial_Landmark_Fitting_via_Optimized_Part_Mixtures_and_Cascaded_Deformable_Shape_Model.html">321 iccv-2013-Pose-Free Facial Landmark Fitting via Optimized Part Mixtures and Cascaded Deformable Shape Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiang Yu, Junzhou Huang, Shaoting Zhang, Wang Yan, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of facial landmark localization and tracking from a single camera. We present a two-stage cascaded deformable shape model to effectively and efficiently localize facial landmarks with large head pose variations. For face detection, we propose a group sparse learning method to automatically select the most salient facial landmarks. By introducing 3D face shape model, we use procrustes analysis to achieve pose-free facial landmark initialization. For deformation, the first step uses mean-shift local search with constrained local model to rapidly approach the global optimum. The second step uses component-wise active contours to discriminatively refine the subtle shape variation. Our framework can simultaneously handle face detection, pose-free landmark localization and tracking in real time. Extensive experiments are conducted on both laboratory environmental face databases and face-in-the-wild databases. All results demonstrate that our approach has certain advantages over state-of-theart methods in handling pose variations1.</p><p>5 0.16057059 <a title="339-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Coupling_Alignments_with_Recognition_for_Still-to-Video_Face_Recognition.html">97 iccv-2013-Coupling Alignments with Recognition for Still-to-Video Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiwu Huang, Xiaowei Zhao, Shiguang Shan, Ruiping Wang, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: The Still-to-Video (S2V) face recognition systems typically need to match faces in low-quality videos captured under unconstrained conditions against high quality still face images, which is very challenging because of noise, image blur, lowface resolutions, varying headpose, complex lighting, and alignment difficulty. To address the problem, one solution is to select the frames of ‘best quality ’ from videos (hereinafter called quality alignment in this paper). Meanwhile, the faces in the selected frames should also be geometrically aligned to the still faces offline well-aligned in the gallery. In this paper, we discover that the interactions among the three tasks–quality alignment, geometric alignment and face recognition–can benefit from each other, thus should be performed jointly. With this in mind, we propose a Coupling Alignments with Recognition (CAR) method to tightly couple these tasks via low-rank regularized sparse representation in a unified framework. Our method makes the three tasks promote mutually by a joint optimization in an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier routine. Extensive , experiments on two challenging S2V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods impressively.</p><p>6 0.1521457 <a title="339-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Modifying_the_Memorability_of_Face_Photographs.html">272 iccv-2013-Modifying the Memorability of Face Photographs</a></p>

<p>Author: Wen-Yan Lin, Ming-Ming Cheng, Shuai Zheng, Jiangbo Lu, Nigel Crook</p><p>Abstract: We propose a generic method for obtaining nonparametric image warps from noisy point correspondences. Our formulation integrates a huber function into a motion coherence framework. This makes our fitting function especially robust to piecewise correspondence noise (where an image section is consistently mismatched). By utilizing over parameterized curves, we can generate realistic nonparametric image warps from very noisy correspondence. We also demonstrate how our algorithm can be used to help stitch images taken from a panning camera by warping the images onto a virtual push-broom camera imaging plane.</p><p>4 0.37500045 <a title="339-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Pose-Free_Facial_Landmark_Fitting_via_Optimized_Part_Mixtures_and_Cascaded_Deformable_Shape_Model.html">321 iccv-2013-Pose-Free Facial Landmark Fitting via Optimized Part Mixtures and Cascaded Deformable Shape Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Yanchao Yang, Ganesh Sundaramoorthi</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to track the precise shape of a dynamic object in video. Joint dynamic shape and appearance models, in which a template of the object is propagated to match the object shape and radiance in the next frame, are advantageous over methods employing global image statistics in cases of complex object radiance and cluttered background. In cases of complex 3D object motion and relative viewpoint change, self-occlusions and disocclusions of the object are prominent, and current methods employing joint shape and appearance models are unable to accurately adapt to new shape and appearance information, leading to inaccurate shape detection. In this work, we model self-occlusions and dis-occlusions in a joint shape and appearance tracking framework. Experiments on video exhibiting occlusion/dis-occlusion, complex radiance and background show that occlusion/dis-occlusion modeling leads to superior shape accuracy compared to recent methods employing joint shape/appearance models or employing global statistics.</p><p>6 0.34454289 <a title="339-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Cascaded_Shape_Space_Pruning_for_Robust_Facial_Landmark_Detection.html">70 iccv-2013-Cascaded Shape Space Pruning for Robust Facial Landmark Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Wei Zeng, Mayank Goswami, Feng Luo, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Surface registration plays a fundamental role in many applications in computer vision and aims at finding a oneto-one correspondence between surfaces. Conformal mapping based surface registration methods conformally map 2D/3D surfaces onto 2D canonical domains and perform the matching on the 2D plane. This registration framework reduces dimensionality, and the result is intrinsic to Riemannian metric and invariant under isometric deformation. However, conformal mapping will be affected by inconsistent boundaries and non-isometric deformations of surfaces. In this work, we quantify the effects of boundary variation and non-isometric deformation to conformal mappings, and give the theoretical upper bounds for the distortions of conformal mappings under these two factors. Besides giving the thorough theoretical proofs of the theorems, we verified them by concrete experiments using 3D human facial scans with dynamic expressions and varying boundaries. Furthermore, we used the distortion estimates for reducing search range in feature matching of surface registration applications. The experimental results are consistent with the theoreticalpredictions and also demonstrate the performance improvements in feature tracking.</p><p>3 0.68886197 <a title="339-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Event_Detection_in_Complex_Scenes_Using_Interval_Temporal_Constraints.html">146 iccv-2013-Event Detection in Complex Scenes Using Interval Temporal Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yifan Zhang, Qiang Ji, Hanqing Lu</p><p>Abstract: In complex scenes with multiple atomic events happening sequentially or in parallel, detecting each individual event separately may not always obtain robust and reliable result. It is essential to detect them in a holistic way which incorporates the causality and temporal dependency among them to compensate the limitation of current computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose an interval temporal constrained dynamic Bayesian network to extendAllen ’s interval algebra network (IAN) [2]from a deterministic static model to a probabilistic dynamic system, which can not only capture the complex interval temporal relationships, but also model the evolution dynamics and handle the uncertainty from the noisy visual observation. In the model, the topology of the IAN on each time slice and the interlinks between the time slices are discovered by an advanced structure learning method. The duration of the event and the unsynchronized time lags between two correlated event intervals are captured by a duration model, so that we can better determine the temporal boundary of the event. Empirical results on two real world datasets show the power of the proposed interval temporal constrained model.</p><p>4 0.67535317 <a title="339-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Monocular_Image_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_under_Self-Occlusion.html">273 iccv-2013-Monocular Image 3D Human Pose Estimation under Self-Occlusion</a></p>
<p>Author: Ibrahim Radwan, Abhinav Dhall, Roland Goecke</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, an automatic approach for 3D pose reconstruction from a single image is proposed. The presence of human body articulation, hallucinated parts and cluttered background leads to ambiguity during the pose inference, which makes the problem non-trivial. Researchers have explored various methods based on motion and shading in order to reduce the ambiguity and reconstruct the 3D pose. The key idea of our algorithm is to impose both kinematic and orientation constraints. The former is imposed by projecting a 3D model onto the input image and pruning the parts, which are incompatible with the anthropomorphism. The latter is applied by creating synthetic views via regressing the input view to multiple oriented views. After applying the constraints, the 3D model is projected onto the initial and synthetic views, which further reduces the ambiguity. Finally, we borrow the direction of the unambiguous parts from the synthetic views to the initial one, which results in the 3D pose. Quantitative experiments are performed on the HumanEva-I dataset and qualitatively on unconstrained images from the Image Parse dataset. The results show the robustness of the proposed approach to accurately reconstruct the 3D pose form a single image.</p><p>5 0.66291559 <a title="339-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Forests_of_Local_Experts_for_Pedestrian_Detection.html">336 iccv-2013-Random Forests of Local Experts for Pedestrian Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Javier Marín, David Vázquez, Antonio M. López, Jaume Amores, Bastian Leibe</p><p>Abstract: Pedestrian detection is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, and has received a lot of attention in the last years. Recently, some authors have shown the advantages of using combinations of part/patch-based detectors in order to cope with the large variability of poses and the existence of partial occlusions. In this paper, we propose a pedestrian detection method that efficiently combines multiple local experts by means of a Random Forest ensemble. The proposed method works with rich block-based representations such as HOG and LBP, in such a way that the same features are reused by the multiple local experts, so that no extra computational cost is needed with respect to a holistic method. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to integrate the proposed approach with a cascaded architecture in order to achieve not only high accuracy but also an acceptable efficiency. In particular, the resulting detector operates at five frames per second using a laptop machine. We tested the proposed method with well-known challenging datasets such as Caltech, ETH, Daimler, and INRIA. The method proposed in this work consistently ranks among the top performers in all the datasets, being either the best method or having a small difference with the best one.</p><p>6 0.64900315 <a title="339-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-GOSUS%3A_Grassmannian_Online_Subspace_Updates_with_Structured-Sparsity.html">182 iccv-2013-GOSUS: Grassmannian Online Subspace Updates with Structured-Sparsity</a></p>

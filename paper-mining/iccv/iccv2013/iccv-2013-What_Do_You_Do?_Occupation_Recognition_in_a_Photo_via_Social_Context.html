<p>Author: Xiaoyang Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a unified probabilistic model to model the relationships between attributes and objects for attribute prediction and object recognition. As a list of semantically meaningful properties of objects, attributes generally relate to each other statistically. In this paper, we propose a unified probabilistic model to automatically discover and capture both the object-dependent and objectindependent attribute relationships. The model utilizes the captured relationships to benefit both attribute prediction and object recognition. Experiments on four benchmark attribute datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed unified model for improving attribute prediction as well as object recognition in both standard and zero-shot learning cases.</p><p>3 0.26856363 <a title="449-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Human_Attribute_Recognition_by_Rich_Appearance_Dictionary.html">204 iccv-2013-Human Attribute Recognition by Rich Appearance Dictionary</a></p>
<p>Author: Jungseock Joo, Shuo Wang, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: We present a part-based approach to the problem of human attribute recognition from a single image of a human body. To recognize the attributes of human from the body parts, it is important to reliably detect the parts. This is a challenging task due to the geometric variation such as articulation and view-point changes as well as the appearance variation of the parts arisen from versatile clothing types. The prior works have primarily focused on handling . edu . cn ???????????? geometric variation by relying on pre-trained part detectors or pose estimators, which require manual part annotation, but the appearance variation has been relatively neglected in these works. This paper explores the importance of the appearance variation, which is directly related to the main task, attribute recognition. To this end, we propose to learn a rich appearance part dictionary of human with significantly less supervision by decomposing image lattice into overlapping windows at multiscale and iteratively refining local appearance templates. We also present quantitative results in which our proposed method outperforms the existing approaches.</p><p>4 0.26760828 <a title="449-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Adaptation_for_Personalized_Image_Search.html">52 iccv-2013-Attribute Adaptation for Personalized Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Adriana Kovashka, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: Current methods learn monolithic attribute predictors, with the assumption that a single model is sufficient to reflect human understanding of a visual attribute. However, in reality, humans vary in how they perceive the association between a named property and image content. For example, two people may have slightly different internal models for what makes a shoe look “formal”, or they may disagree on which of two scenes looks “more cluttered”. Rather than discount these differences as noise, we propose to learn user-specific attribute models. We adapt a generic model trained with annotations from multiple users, tailoring it to satisfy user-specific labels. Furthermore, we propose novel techniques to infer user-specific labels based on transitivity and contradictions in the user’s search history. We demonstrate that adapted attributes improve accuracy over both existing monolithic models as well as models that learn from scratch with user-specific data alone. In addition, we show how adapted attributes are useful to personalize image search, whether with binary or relative attributes.</p><p>5 0.24909338 <a title="449-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Dominance%3A_What_Pops_Out%3F.html">53 iccv-2013-Attribute Dominance: What Pops Out?</a></p>
<p>Author: Naman Turakhia, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: When we look at an image, some properties or attributes of the image stand out more than others. When describing an image, people are likely to describe these dominant attributes first. Attribute dominance is a result of a complex interplay between the various properties present or absent in the image. Which attributes in an image are more dominant than others reveals rich information about the content of the image. In this paper we tap into this information by modeling attribute dominance.

<p>Author: Amir Sadovnik, Andrew Gallagher, Devi Parikh, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a great deal of progress in describing objects with attributes. Attributes have proven useful for object recognition, image search, face verification, image description, and zero-shot learning. Typically, attributes are either binary or relative: they describe either the presence or absence of a descriptive characteristic, or the relative magnitude of the characteristic when comparing two exemplars. However, prior work fails to model the actual way in which humans use these attributes in descriptive statements of images. Specifically, it does not address the important interactions between the binary and relative aspects of an attribute. In this work we propose a spoken attribute classifier which models a more natural way of using an attribute in a description. For each attribute we train a classifier which captures the specific way this attribute should be used. We show that as a result of using this model, we produce descriptions about images of people that are more natural and specific than past systems.</p><p>3 0.79916954 <a title="449-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Dominance%3A_What_Pops_Out%3F.html">53 iccv-2013-Attribute Dominance: What Pops Out?</a></p>

<p>Author: Cheng Deng, Rongrong Ji, Wei Liu, Dacheng Tao, Xinbo Gao</p><p>Abstract: Visual reranking has been widely deployed to refine the quality of conventional content-based image retrieval engines. The current trend lies in employing a crowd of retrieved results stemming from multiple feature modalities to boost the overall performance of visual reranking. However, a major challenge pertaining to current reranking methods is how to take full advantage of the complementary property of distinct feature modalities. Given a query image and one feature modality, a regular visual reranking framework treats the top-ranked images as pseudo positive instances which are inevitably noisy, difficult to reveal this complementary property, and thus lead to inferior ranking performance. This paper proposes a novel image reranking approach by introducing a Co-Regularized Multi-Graph Learning (Co-RMGL) framework, in which the intra-graph and inter-graph constraints are simultaneously imposed to encode affinities in a single graph and consistency across different graphs. Moreover, weakly supervised learning driven by image attributes is performed to denoise the pseudo- labeled instances, thereby highlighting the unique strength of individual feature modality. Meanwhile, such learning can yield a few anchors in graphs that vitally enable the alignment and fusion of multiple graphs. As a result, an edge weight matrix learned from the fused graph automatically gives the ordering to the initially retrieved results. We evaluate our approach on four benchmark image retrieval datasets, demonstrating a significant performance gain over the state-of-the-arts.</p><p>4 0.67861938 <a title="449-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Probabilistic_Volumetric_Models.html">128 iccv-2013-Dynamic Probabilistic Volumetric Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Osman Ulusoy, Octavian Biris, Joseph L. Mundy</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic volumetric framework for image based modeling of general dynamic 3-d scenes. The framework is targeted towards high quality modeling of complex scenes evolving over thousands of frames. Extensive storage and computational resources are required in processing large scale space-time (4-d) data. Existing methods typically store separate 3-d models at each time step and do not address such limitations. A novel 4-d representation is proposed that adaptively subdivides in space and time to explain the appearance of 3-d dynamic surfaces. This representation is shown to achieve compression of 4-d data and provide efficient spatio-temporal processing. The advances oftheproposedframework is demonstrated on standard datasets using free-viewpoint video and 3-d tracking applications.</p><p>5 0.66533828 <a title="449-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Joint_Intensity_and_Depth_Co-sparse_Analysis_Model_for_Depth_Map_Super-resolution.html">18 iccv-2013-A Joint Intensity and Depth Co-sparse Analysis Model for Depth Map Super-resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Kiechle, Simon Hawe, Martin Kleinsteuber</p><p>Abstract: High-resolution depth maps can be inferred from lowresolution depth measurements and an additional highresolution intensity image of the same scene. To that end, we introduce a bimodal co-sparse analysis model, which is able to capture the interdependency of registered intensity . go l e i um . de . .t ities together with the knowledge of the relative positions between all views. Despite very active research in this area and significant improvements over the past years, stereo methods still struggle with noise, texture-less regions, repetitive texture, and occluded areas. For an overview of stereo methods, the reader is referred to [25]. and depth information. This model is based on the assumption that the co-supports of corresponding bimodal image structures are aligned when computed by a suitable pair of analysis operators. No analytic form of such operators ex- ist and we propose a method for learning them from a set of registered training signals. This learning process is done offline and returns a bimodal analysis operator that is universally applicable to natural scenes. We use this to exploit the bimodal co-sparse analysis model as a prior for solving inverse problems, which leads to an efficient algorithm for depth map super-resolution.</p><p>6 0.64625716 <a title="449-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Near-Optimal_Cost-Sensitive_Decision_Policy_for_Object_Detection.html">241 iccv-2013-Learning Near-Optimal Cost-Sensitive Decision Policy for Object Detection</a></p>

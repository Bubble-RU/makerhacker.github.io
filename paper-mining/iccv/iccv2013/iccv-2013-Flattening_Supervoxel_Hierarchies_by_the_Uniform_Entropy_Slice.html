<p>Author: Aastha Jain, Shuanak Chatterjee, René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose an exact, general and efficient coarse-to-fine energy minimization strategy for semantic video segmentation. Our strategy is based on a hierarchical abstraction of the supervoxel graph that allows us to minimize an energy defined at the finest level of the hierarchy by minimizing a series of simpler energies defined over coarser graphs. The strategy is exact, i.e., it produces the same solution as minimizing over the finest graph. It is general, i.e., it can be used to minimize any energy function (e.g., unary, pairwise, and higher-order terms) with any existing energy minimization algorithm (e.g., graph cuts and belief propagation). It also gives significant speedups in inference for several datasets with varying degrees of spatio-temporal continuity. We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our strategy relative to existing hierarchical approaches, and the kinds of image and video data that provide the best speedups.</p><p>3 0.42605108 <a title="172-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Temporally_Consistent_Superpixels.html">414 iccv-2013-Temporally Consistent Superpixels</a></p>

<p>Author: Min Sun, Wan Huang, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: Many methods have been proposed to solve the image classification problem for a large number of categories. Among them, methods based on tree-based representations achieve good trade-off between accuracy and test time efficiency. While focusing on learning a tree-shaped hierarchy and the corresponding set of classifiers, most of them [11, 2, 14] use a greedy prediction algorithm for test time efficiency. We argue that the dramatic decrease in accuracy at high efficiency is caused by the specific design choice of the learning and greedy prediction algorithms. In this work, we propose a classifier which achieves a better trade-off between efficiency and accuracy with a given tree-shaped hierarchy. First, we convert the classification problem as finding the best path in the hierarchy, and a novel branchand-bound-like algorithm is introduced to efficiently search for the best path. Second, we jointly train the classifiers using a novel Structured SVM (SSVM) formulation with additional bound constraints. As a result, our method achieves a significant 4.65%, 5.43%, and 4.07% (relative 24.82%, 41.64%, and 109.79%) improvement in accuracy at high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art greedy “tree-based” methods [14] on Caltech-256 [15], SUN [32] and ImageNet 1K [9] dataset, respectively. Finally, we show that our branch-and-bound-like algorithm naturally ranks the paths in the hierarchy (Fig. 8) so that users can further process them.</p><p>5 0.21351315 <a title="172-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Unified_Video_Segmentation_Benchmark%3A_Annotation%2C_Metrics_and_Analysis.html">33 iccv-2013-A Unified Video Segmentation Benchmark: Annotation, Metrics and Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabio Galasso, Naveen Shankar Nagaraja, Tatiana Jiménez Cárdenas, Thomas Brox, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: Video segmentation research is currently limited by the lack of a benchmark dataset that covers the large variety of subproblems appearing in video segmentation and that is large enough to avoid overfitting. Consequently, there is little analysis of video segmentation which generalizes across subtasks, and it is not yet clear which and how video segmentation should leverage the information from the still-frames, as previously studied in image segmentation, alongside video specific information, such as temporal volume, motion and occlusion. In this work we provide such an analysis based on annotations of a large video dataset, where each video is manually segmented by multiple persons. Moreover, we introduce a new volume-based metric that includes the important aspect of temporal consistency, that can deal with segmentation hierarchies, and that reflects the tradeoff between over-segmentation and segmentation accuracy.</p><p>6 0.14348908 <a title="172-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-YouTube2Text%3A_Recognizing_and_Describing_Arbitrary_Activities_Using_Semantic_Hierarchies_and_Zero-Shot_Recognition.html">452 iccv-2013-YouTube2Text: Recognizing and Describing Arbitrary Activities Using Semantic Hierarchies and Zero-Shot Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Van_Den_Bergh, Gemma Roig, Xavier Boix, Santiago Manen, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Superpixel and objectness algorithms are broadly used as a pre-processing step to generate support regions and to speed-up further computations. Recently, many algorithms have been extended to video in order to exploit the temporal consistency between frames. However, most methods are computationally too expensive for real-time applications. We introduce an online, real-time video superpixel algorithm based on the recently proposed SEEDS superpixels. A new capability is incorporated which delivers multiple diverse samples (hypotheses) of superpixels in the same image or video sequence. The multiple samples are shown to provide a strong cue to efficiently measure the objectness of image windows, and we introduce the novel concept of objectness in temporal windows. Experiments show that the video superpixels achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art offline methods while running at 30 fps on a single 2.8 GHz i7 CPU. State-of-the-art performance on objectness is also demonstrated, yet orders of magnitude faster and extended to temporal windows in video.</p><p>6 0.32890788 <a title="172-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-YouTube2Text%3A_Recognizing_and_Describing_Arbitrary_Activities_Using_Semantic_Hierarchies_and_Zero-Shot_Recognition.html">452 iccv-2013-YouTube2Text: Recognizing and Describing Arbitrary Activities Using Semantic Hierarchies and Zero-Shot Recognition</a></p>

We formulate the uniform entropy slice as a binary quadratic program and implement four different feature criteria, both unsupervised and supervised, to drive the flattening. Although we apply it only to supervoxel hierarchies in this paper, our method is generally applicable to segmentation tree hierarchies. Our experiments demonstrate both strong qualitative performance and superior quantitative performance to state of the art baselines on benchmark internet videos.</p><p>2 0.72440851 <a title="172-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-scale_Topological_Features_for_Hand_Posture_Representation_and_Analysis.html">278 iccv-2013-Multi-scale Topological Features for Hand Posture Representation and Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Kaoning Hu, Lijun Yin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-scale topological feature representation for automatic analysis of hand posture. Such topological features have the advantage of being posture-dependent while being preserved under certain variations of illumination, rotation, personal dependency, etc. Our method studies the topology of the holes between the hand region and its convex hull. Inspired by the principle of Persistent Homology, which is the theory of computational topology for topological feature analysis over multiple scales, we construct the multi-scale Betti Numbers matrix (MSBNM) for the topological feature representation. In our experiments, we used 12 different hand postures and compared our features with three popular features (HOG, MCT, and Shape Context) on different data sets. In addition to hand postures, we also extend the feature representations to arm postures. The results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method.</p><p>3 0.71015608 <a title="172-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Single-Patch_Low-Rank_Prior_for_Non-pointwise_Impulse_Noise_Removal.html">394 iccv-2013-Single-Patch Low-Rank Prior for Non-pointwise Impulse Noise Removal</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruixuan Wang, Emanuele Trucco</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a ‘low-rank prior’ for small oriented noise-free image patches: considering an oriented patch as a matrix, a low-rank matrix approximation is enough to preserve the texture details in the properly oriented patch. Based on this prior, we propose a single-patch method within a generalized joint low-rank and sparse matrix recovery framework to simultaneously detect and remove non-pointwise random-valued impulse noise (e.g., very small blobs). A weighting matrix is incorporated in the framework to encode an initial estimate of the spatial noise distribution. An accelerated proximal gradient method is adapted to estimate the optimal noise-free image patches. Experiments show the effectiveness of our framework in removing non-pointwise random-valued impulse noise.</p><p>4 0.67607987 <a title="172-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Visual_Semantic_Complex_Network_for_Web_Images.html">446 iccv-2013-Visual Semantic Complex Network for Web Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Shi Qiu, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes modeling the complex web image collections with an automatically generated graph structure called visual semantic complex network (VSCN). The nodes on this complex network are clusters of images with both visual and semantic consistency, called semantic concepts. These nodes are connected based on the visual and semantic correlations. Our VSCN with 33, 240 concepts is generated from a collection of 10 million web images. 1 A great deal of valuable information on the structures of the web image collections can be revealed by exploring the VSCN, such as the small-world behavior, concept community, indegree distribution, hubs, and isolated concepts. It not only helps us better understand the web image collections at a macroscopic level, but also has many important practical applications. This paper presents two application examples: content-based image retrieval and image browsing. Experimental results show that the VSCN leads to significant improvement on both the precision of image retrieval (over 200%) and user experience for image browsing.</p><p>5 0.64759576 <a title="172-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Framework_for_Shape_Analysis_via_Hilbert_Space_Embedding.html">10 iccv-2013-A Framework for Shape Analysis via Hilbert Space Embedding</a></p>
<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for 2D shape analysis using positive definite kernels defined on Kendall’s shape manifold. Different representations of 2D shapes are known to generate different nonlinear spaces. Due to the nonlinearity of these spaces, most existing shape classification algorithms resort to nearest neighbor methods and to learning distances on shape spaces. Here, we propose to map shapes on Kendall’s shape manifold to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To this end, we introduce a kernel on this manifold that permits such a mapping, and prove its positive definiteness. This kernel lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM, MKL and kernel PCA, to the shape manifold. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods on shape classification, clustering and retrieval.</p><p>6 0.64424497 <a title="172-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Motion_for_Every_Visible_Point.html">441 iccv-2013-Video Motion for Every Visible Point</a></p>

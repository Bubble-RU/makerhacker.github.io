</p><p>7 Introduction Since the proposition of a stereo framework in a seminal paper [24] a decade ago, most stereo matching methods are following the four-step pipeline: 1) matching cost computation; 2) cost aggregation; 3) disparity optimization; 4) disparity refinement. [sent-12, score-0.77]
</p><p>8 proving the accuracy, local methods have focused on robust cost computation (step 1) [2, 13, 8] and edge-aware cost aggregation (step 2) [33, 34, 22, 17, 30]. [sent-18, score-0.526]
</p><p>9 [22] adopt weighted median filtering with bilateral weights [26] to refine local aggregation results. [sent-28, score-1.438]
</p><p>10 Yang [30] refines the non-local aggregation results by another non-local cost aggregation. [sent-30, score-0.474]
</p><p>11 [25] discover that the weighted median filtering is a crucial post-processing in each iteration of optimizing the flows. [sent-32, score-0.855]
</p><p>12 In this paper, we present a constant time weighted median filter for local stereo refinement. [sent-33, score-1.116]
</p><p>13 In terms of research, we discover that with our technique, the refined results of simple box filter cost aggregation [24] can be comparable with the refined results of various sophisticated cost aggregation (e. [sent-35, score-1.521]
</p><p>14 4) and also on the superiority of the refined box-filter aggregation results in a fair number of individual cases (detailed in Fig. [sent-39, score-0.44]
</p><p>15 This is because of the nice weighted median filtering properties of removing outliers while respecting edges/structures. [sent-41, score-0.946]
</p><p>16 In practice, this discovery leads to a fast and high-quality stereo solution - simple box aggregation followed by our constant time weighted median refinement. [sent-43, score-1.458]
</p><p>17 In this example, with our refinement, the box aggregation and the more complex guided aggregation [10, 22] are comparably accurate (1. [sent-46, score-1.158]
</p><p>18 62), but the former is much faster 1Actually, in [22] the weighted median filter is only performed near detected depth edges. [sent-49, score-0.924]
</p><p>19 With our weighted median filtering refinement, simple box-filter aggregation [24] can be comparably good as sophisticated aggregation [22] using guided filters [10]. [sent-63, score-1.975]
</p><p>20 (a) Box-filter aggregation followed by left-right check [4] and hole-filling [2]. [sent-64, score-0.457]
</p><p>21 (b) Guided-filter aggregation followed by left-right check and holefilling. [sent-65, score-0.457]
</p><p>22 The above discussion is made possible by our fast constant time algorithm for weighted median filtering. [sent-72, score-0.693]
</p><p>23 This algorithm is driven by the recent progress on fast median filtering [20, 3, 15], fast algorithms [7, 19, 21, 3 1] for bilateral filtering [26], and other fast edge-aware filtering [10, 9]. [sent-73, score-1.493]
</p><p>24 This framework reveals that the (unweighted) median filter can be implemented as a box filter in a high-dimensional space. [sent-76, score-1.178]
</p><p>25 Thus we can replace this box filter with constant time edge-aware filters [10, 9] for weighted median filtering. [sent-77, score-1.134]
</p><p>26 As a byproduct, our fast algorithm for weighted median filtering allows us to treat it as a general image filter and study its behaviors in various applications. [sent-79, score-1.175]
</p><p>27 In sum, our paper makes these main contributions: (1) We discover that the disparity refinement (step 4) can be at least as important as the other steps in stereo matching. [sent-82, score-0.506]
</p><p>28 The combination of simple box aggregation and our weighted median refinement achieves good accuracy and very fast  speed. [sent-83, score-1.326]
</p><p>29 (2) We present the first constant time algorithm for weighted median filtering. [sent-84, score-0.651]
</p><p>30 We publish the Matlab code of the constant time weighted median filter on our website2. [sent-86, score-0.945]
</p><p>31 Constant Time Weighted Median Filtering We first introduce our constant time algorithm for weighted median filtering. [sent-88, score-0.651]
</p><p>32 Median Filtering The (unweighted) median filter [14] has been long considered as a way of removing “outliers” like salt-and-pepper noise. [sent-93, score-0.757]
</p><p>33 This filter replaces the value of a pixel with the median of its neighbors. [sent-94, score-0.739]
</p><p>34 , disparity/intensities), this median can be computed from a histogram h(x, ·) that calculates the population around the potsoitgiornam x =(x (,x·,) y th) : h(x,i) =  ? [sent-97, score-0.451]
</p><p>35 Weighted Median Filtering  The unweighted median filter treats each neighbor equally, and may lead to morphological artifacts like rounding sharp corners and removing thin structures (e. [sent-106, score-1.112]
</p><p>36 To address this problem, the weighted median filter [25, 22] has been introduced. [sent-110, score-0.857]
</p><p>37 As in the unweighted case, the median value is obtained by accumulating this histogram. [sent-122, score-0.707]
</p><p>38 (b) The result of box aggregation  + left-right  check  + hole-filling. [sent-134, score-0.582]
</p><p>39 (c) The unweighted median filtering result of (b). [sent-135, score-0.941]
</p><p>40 (c): A guided filter is performed on f(x, i) for each fixed i. [sent-144, score-0.462]
</p><p>41 Because box filtering can be efficiently performed using integral images [5, 27] or moving sums in O(1) time, the unweighted median filter is O(1) time. [sent-161, score-1.36]
</p><p>42 The existing O(1) median filtering algorithms [3, 20] can be viewed as an implementation of this formulation. [sent-162, score-0.7]
</p><p>43 For weighted median filtering, we can simply replace x? [sent-163, score-0.563]
</p><p>44 , the bilateral filter [26], the guided filter [10], or the domain transform filter [9]. [sent-168, score-1.271]
</p><p>45 If the edgeaware filter is O(1) time, the resulting weighted median filter is O(1) time. [sent-171, score-1.188]
</p><p>46 (d) The median value is taken from the histogram of each pixel and Choosing Filter Weights Our constant time weighted median filter is compatible with various weights - it only requires the corresponding edge-aware filter to be constant time. [sent-174, score-1.819]
</p><p>47 In this paper, we consider the following O(1) time edge-aware filters: the O(1) time solutions [21, 3 1] to the bilateral filter [26], the guided filter [10], and the domain transform filter [9]. [sent-175, score-1.313]
</p><p>48 The O(1) bilateral filter [21, 3 1] is much slower than the other two, unless the range is aggressively quantized. [sent-176, score-0.469]
</p><p>49 On the contrary, both the guided filter and the domain transform filter require no quantization/coarsening. [sent-178, score-0.802]
</p><p>50 We also find the accuracy of using the domain transform weights for stereo refinement is not as good as using the guided filter weights. [sent-180, score-0.857]
</p><p>51 For these reasons, throughout this paper we use the guided filter weights as the weights for median filtering. [sent-181, score-0.935]
</p><p>52 The guided filter has edge-aware kernels similar to the bilateral filter [10] (Fig. [sent-182, score-0.931]
</p><p>53 Relations to Previous Methods We show that various fast algorithms for bilateral filtering [7, 19, 21, 31] and median filtering [14, 3, 20, 15] can be unified in the same framework of high-dimensional filtering. [sent-186, score-1.175]
</p><p>54 (5) is exactly the bilateral filter (plus some proper manipulations, namely, division and slicing [19]). [sent-224, score-0.514]
</p><p>55 Filter Properties The weighted median filter inherits some desired properties from both median filtering and edge-aware averaging filtering (the guided filter). [sent-237, score-1.979]
</p><p>56 The weighted median filter is capable of removing “outlier” noise as a median filter. [sent-238, score-1.32]
</p><p>57 On the other hand, the weighted median filter is edgeaware. [sent-245, score-0.857]
</p><p>58 This is in contrast to the unweighted median filter. [sent-246, score-0.686]
</p><p>59 2 (e)), the weighted median filter is capable of capturing the strong edges, sharp corners, and thin structures from the image I (see Fig. [sent-248, score-0.875]
</p><p>60 The unweighted median filter does not have this good property and produces morphological artifacts (Fig. [sent-250, score-1.058]
</p><p>61 Actually, the unweighted median filter is blind to the image I and can merely access the noisy map V . [sent-252, score-0.98]
</p><p>62 Experiments on Stereo Refinement Thanks to the constant time algorithm for weighted median filtering, it is feasible for us to study its performance for refining local stereo results. [sent-254, score-0.84]
</p><p>63 We have tested four kinds of O(1) time aggregation: the box filter, the guided filter [10] (adopted in [22]), the variable cross filter [34], and the non-local filter [30]. [sent-262, score-1.215]
</p><p>64 Error rates on four Middlebury  Before WM  After WM  (c) 2005 (6 pairs)  Before WM  After WM  (d) 2006 (15 pairs)  datasets before and after WM, using four different aggregation filters. [sent-291, score-0.501]
</p><p>65 On the resulting disparity map of (4-i), we apply the weighted median (WM) filter. [sent-295, score-0.706]
</p><p>66 The parameters of the guided filter used in this WM are fixed as ? [sent-296, score-0.462]
</p><p>67 A 3x3 unweighted median filter is finally applied to remove a few spikes. [sent-299, score-0.98]
</p><p>68 The main modifications are that we apply our WM filter for refinement, and we investigate four filters in cost  aggregation. [sent-301, score-0.429]
</p><p>69 The purpose of using this pipeline is for a better understanding of the roles of aggregation vs. [sent-302, score-0.444]
</p><p>70 , using advanced costs, fine-tuning the filter parameters, incorporating median filters for intermediate-processing, or improving the simple hole-filling. [sent-306, score-0.804]
</p><p>71 In this implementation, the weighted median filter takes about 60ms per mega-pixel per disparity (see [11] for more technical details about implementing the guided filter). [sent-310, score-1.188]
</p><p>72 4 shows the error rates before and after weighted  median filtering. [sent-321, score-0.636]
</p><p>73 at/research/costFi lter/ rates of different aggregation methods are significant different. [sent-327, score-0.463]
</p><p>74 Before WM, the guided filter aggregation is the most competitive in all four datasets, whereas the box filter aggregation is generally poor. [sent-328, score-1.744]
</p><p>75 But we discover that after WM the error rates of different aggregation methods are very comparable (especially in the 2001, 2005, and 2006 sets). [sent-329, score-0.532]
</p><p>76 Typically, the box filter aggregation with WM can be almost as good as the other sophisticated aggregation methods with WM. [sent-330, score-1.304]
</p><p>77 4), but also on the fact that the simple “box aggregation + WM” is more accurate than the sophisticated “guided aggregation + WM” in a number of cases (12 out of all 3 1 pairs). [sent-332, score-0.904]
</p><p>78 Before WM, the box filter aggregation produces more outliers than the other sophisticated aggregation methods (see Fig. [sent-337, score-1.344]
</p><p>79 These outliers can be reliably removed by median filtering in a sufficiently large support, if only the “inliers” in this large support are dominant. [sent-340, score-0.741]
</p><p>80 This issue is nicely addressed by median filtering in a large edge-aware support (Fig. [sent-343, score-0.701]
</p><p>81 So even though the box filter aggregation produces more outliers, they can still be removed (unless in the support the outliers are dominant). [sent-346, score-0.9]
</p><p>82 A Fast Practical Solution The above discovery suggests a very fast solution in practice - combining the box filter aggregation with WM refinement. [sent-349, score-0.911]
</p><p>83 This solution harnesses the fast speed of box filter aggregation, and almost does not sacrifice accuracy due to the WM. [sent-350, score-0.461]
</p><p>84 It is clear that the “box aggregation + WM” is a compelling choice, considering both speed and accuracy. [sent-354, score-0.443]
</p><p>85 GPU implementation The box aggregation and the WM can both be easily implemented on GPU. [sent-355, score-0.581]
</p><p>86 Because our WM uses guided filtering weights and the algorithm of the guid53  Venus2. [sent-356, score-0.446]

</p><p>90 We have implemented “box aggregation + WM” and “guided aggregation + WM” on a GeForce GTX580 GPU (512 CUDA cores, 1. [sent-389, score-0.86]
</p><p>91 We are not aware of any GPU implementation of the non-local aggregation [30] and cross aggregation [34], so their performance on GPU remains unknown. [sent-392, score-0.862]
</p><p>92 Table 2 shows that our GPU implementation of “box aggregation + WM” takes 22ms, about 3x faster than [22]. [sent-399, score-0.44]
</p><p>93 4 & 6, we believe the “box aggregation + WM” is a very fast practical solution (in both CPU and GPU) that slightly trades off accuracy. [sent-401, score-0.464]
</p><p>94 More Applications  The weighted median filter is not only applicable for stereo refinement. [sent-409, score-1.028]
</p><p>95 Conclusion We have proposed the first constant time weighted median filtering algorithm for stereo refinement and other applications. [sent-452, score-1.232]

<p>Author: Philipp Heise, Sebastian Klose, Brian Jensen, Alois Knoll</p><p>Abstract: Most stereo correspondence algorithms match support windows at integer-valued disparities and assume a constant disparity value within the support window. The recently proposed PatchMatch stereo algorithm [7] overcomes this limitation of previous algorithms by directly estimating planes. This work presents a method that integrates the PatchMatch stereo algorithm into a variational smoothing formulation using quadratic relaxation. The resulting algorithm allows the explicit regularization of the disparity and normal gradients using the estimated plane parameters. Evaluation of our method in the Middlebury benchmark shows that our method outperforms the traditional integer-valued disparity strategy as well as the original algorithm and its variants in sub-pixel accurate disparity estimation.</p><p>3 0.13675255 <a title="88-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Guided_Depth_Upsampling_Using_Anisotropic_Total_Generalized_Variation.html">209 iccv-2013-Image Guided Depth Upsampling Using Anisotropic Total Generalized Variation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Ferstl, Christian Reinbacher, Rene Ranftl, Matthias Ruether, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present a novel method for the challenging problem of depth image upsampling. Modern depth cameras such as Kinect or Time of Flight cameras deliver dense, high quality depth measurements but are limited in their lateral resolution. To overcome this limitation we formulate a convex optimization problem using higher order regularization for depth image upsampling. In this optimization an anisotropic diffusion tensor, calculated from a high resolution intensity image, is used to guide the upsampling. We derive a numerical algorithm based on a primaldual formulation that is efficiently parallelized and runs at multiple frames per second. We show that this novel upsampling clearly outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of speed and accuracy on the widely used Middlebury 2007 datasets. Furthermore, we introduce novel datasets with highly accurate groundtruth, which, for the first time, enable to benchmark depth upsampling methods using real sensor data.</p><p>4 0.13660681 <a title="88-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Pose_Estimation_and_Segmentation_of_People_in_3D_Movies.html">322 iccv-2013-Pose Estimation and Segmentation of People in 3D Movies</a></p>

This involves challenges such as dealing with unconstrained stereoscopic video, non-stationary cameras, and complex indoor and outdoor dynamic scenes. The contributions of our work are two-fold: First, we develop a segmentation model incorporating person detection, pose estimation, as well as colour, motion, and disparity cues. Our new model explicitly represents depth ordering and occlusion. Second, we introduce a stereoscopic dataset with frames extracted from feature-length movies “StreetDance 3D ” and “Pina ”. The dataset contains 2727 realistic stereo pairs and includes annotation of human poses, person bounding boxes, and pixel-wise segmentations for hundreds of people. The dataset is composed of indoor and outdoor scenes depicting multiple people with frequent occlusions. We demonstrate results on our new challenging dataset, as well as on the H2view dataset from (Sheasby et al.

It allows to benefit from the simplicity and accuracy of dense tracking which does not depend on visual features while running in real-time on a CPU. The key idea is to continuously estimate a semi-dense inverse depth map for the current frame, which in turn is used to track the motion of the camera using dense image alignment. More specifically, we estimate the depth of all pixels which have a non-negligible image gradient. Each estimate is represented as a Gaussian probability distribution over the inverse depth. We propagate this information over time, and update it with new measurements as new images arrive. In terms of tracking accuracy and computational speed, the proposed method compares favorably to both state-of-the-art dense and feature-based visual odometry and SLAM algorithms. As our method runs in real-time on a CPU, it is oflargepractical valuefor robotics and augmented reality applications. – – 1. Towards Dense Monocular Visual Odometry Tracking a hand-held camera and recovering the threedimensional structure of the environment in real-time is among the most prominent challenges in computer vision. In the last years, dense approaches to these challenges have become increasingly popular: Instead of operating solely on visual feature positions, they reconstruct and track on the whole image using a surface-based map and thereby are fundamentally different from feature-based approaches. Yet, these methods are to date either not real-time capable on standard CPUs [11, 15, 17] or require direct depth measurements from the sensor [7], making them unsuitable for many practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-dense visual odometry approach for a monocular camera, which combines the accuracy and robustness of dense approaches with the efficiency of feature-based methods. Further, it computes highly accurate semi-dense depth maps from the monocular images, providing rich information about the 3D ∗ This work was supported by the ERC Starting Grant ConvexVision and the DFG project Mapping on Demand Figure1.Semi-Dens MoncularVisualOdometry:Oucfrloas rpe- proach works on a semi-dense inverse depth map and combines the accuracy and robustness of dense visual SLAM methods with the efficiency of feature-based techniques.

We use the term visual odometry as supposed to SLAM, as for simplicity we deliberately maintain only information about the currently visible scene, instead of building a global world-model. – – 1.1. Related Work Feature-based monocular SLAM. In all feature-based methods (such as [4, 8]), tracking and mapping consists of two separate steps: First, discrete feature observations (i.e., their locations in the image) are extracted and matched to each other. Second, the camera and the full feature poses are calculated from a set of such observations disregarding the images themselves. While this preliminary abstrac– tion step greatly reduces the complexity of the overall problem and allows it to be tackled in real time, it inherently comes with two significant drawbacks: First, only image information conforming to the respective feature type and parametrization typically image corners and blobs [6] or line segments [9] is utilized. Second, features have to be matched to each other, which often requires the costly computation of scale- and rotation-invariant descriptors and robust outlier estimation methods like RANSAC. – – Dense monocular SLAM. To overcome these limitations and to better exploit the available image information, dense monocular SLAM methods [11, 17] have recently been proposed. The fundamental difference to keypoint-based approaches is that these methods directly work on the images 11444499 instead of a set of extracted features, for both mapping and tracking: The world is modeled as dense surface while in turn new frames are tracked using whole-image alignment. This concept removes the need for discrete features, and allows to exploit all information present in the image, increasing tracking accuracy and robustness. To date however, doing this in real-time is only possible using modern, powerful GPU processors. Similar methods are broadly used in combination with RGB-D cameras [7], which directly measure the depth of each pixel, or stereo camera rigs [3] greatly reducing the – complexity of the problem. Dense multi-view stereo. Significant prior work exists on multi-view dense reconstruction, both in a real-time setting [13, 11, 15], as well as off-line [5, 14]. In particular for offline reconstruction, there is a long history of using different baselines to steer the stereo-inherent trade-off between accuracy and precision [12]. Most similar to our approach is the early work of Matthies et al., who proposed probabilistic depth map fusion and propagation for image sequences [10], however only for structure from motion, i.e., not coupled with subsequent dense tracking. 1.2. Contributions In this paper, we propose a novel semi-dense approach to monocular visual odometry, which does not require feature points. The key concepts are • a probabilistic depth map representation, • tracking based on whole-image alignment, • the reduction on image-regions which carry informattihoen (esdeumctii-odenn osen), i manadg • the full incorporation of stereo measurement uncertainty. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first featureless, real-time monocular visual odometry approach, which runs in real-time on a CPU. 1.3. Method Outline Our approach is partially motivated by the basic principle that for most real-time applications, video information is abundant and cheap to come by. Therefore, the computational budget should be spent such that the expected information gain is maximized. Instead of reducing the images to a sparse set of feature observations however, our method continuously estimates a semi-dense inverse depth map for the current frame, i.e., a dense depth map covering all image regions with non-negligible gradient (see Fig. 2). It is comprised of one inverse depth hypothesis per pixel modeled by a Gaussian probability distribution. This representation still allows to use whole-image alignment [7] to track new orignalimagesemi-densedepthmap(ours)clfoasre keypointdepthmap[8]densedepthmap[1 ]RGB-Dcamera[16] Figure 2. Semi-Dense Approach: Our approach reconstructs and tracks on a semi-dense inverse depth map, which is dense in all image regions carrying information (top-right). For comparison, the bottom row shows the respective result from a keypoint-based approach, a fully dense approach and the ground truth from an RGB-D camera. frames, while at the same time greatly reducing computational complexity compared to volumetric methods. The estimated depth map is propagated from frame to frame, and updated with variable-baseline stereo comparisons. We explicitly use prior knowledge about a pixel’s depth to select a suitable reference frame on a per-pixel basis, and to limit the disparity search range. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the semi-dense mapping part of the proposed method, including the derivation of the observation accuracy as well as the probabilistic data fusion, propagation and regularization steps. Section 3 describes how new frames are tracked using whole-image alignment, and Sec. 4 summarizes the complete visual odometry method. A qualitative as well as a quantitative evaluation is presented in Sec. 5. We then give a brief conclusion in Sec. 6. 2. Semi-Dense Depth Map Estimation One of the key ideas proposed in this paper is to estimate a semi-dense inverse depth map for the current camera image, which in turn can be used for estimating the camera pose of the next frame. This depth map is continuously propagated from frame to frame, and refined with new stereo depth measurements, which are obtained by performing per-pixel, adaptive-baseline stereo comparisons. This allows us to accurately estimate the depth both of close-by and far-away image regions. In contrast to previous work that accumulates the photometric cost over a sequence of several frames [11, 15], we keep exactly one inverse depth hypothesis per pixel that we represent as Gaussian probability distribution. This section is comprised of three main parts: Sec11445500 reference small baseline medium baseline large baseline tcso0120 .050.10.150.20.2sl5m areagdleiulm0.3 inverse depth d Figure 3. Variable Baseline Stereo: Reference image (left), three stereo images at different baselines (right), and the respective matching cost functions. While a small baseline (black) gives a unique, but imprecise minimum, a large baseline (red) allows for a very precise estimate, but has many false minima. tion 2. 1 describes the stereo method used to extract new depth measurements from previous frames, and how they are incorporated into the prior depth map. In Sec. 2.2, we describe how the depth map is propagated from frame to frame. In Sec. 2.3, we detail how we partially regularize the obtained depth map in each iteration, and how outliers are handled. Throughout this section, d denotes the inverse depth of a pixel. 2.1. Stereo-Based Depth Map Update It is well known [12] that for stereo, there is a trade-off between precision and accuracy (see Fig. 3). While many multiple-baseline stereo approaches resolve this by accumulating the respective cost functions over many frames [5, 13], we propose a probabilistic approach which explicitly takes advantage of the fact that in a video, smallbaseline frames are available before large-baseline frames. The full depth map update (performed once for each new frame) consists of the following steps: First, a subset of pixels is selected for which the accuracy of a disparity search is sufficiently large. For this we use three intuitive and very efficiently computable criteria, which will be derived in Sec. 2. 1.3. For each selected pixel, we then individually select a suitable reference frame, and perform a onedimensional disparity search. Propagated prior knowledge is used to reduce the disparity search range when possible, decreasing computational cost and eliminating false minima. The obtained inverse depth estimate is then fused into the depth map. 2.1.1 Reference Frame Selection Ideally, the reference frame is chosen such that it maximizes the stereo accuracy, while keeping the disparity search range as well as the observation angle sufficiently cur ent framepixel’s “age” -4.8 s -3.9 s -3.1 s -2.2 s -1.2 s -0.8 s -0.5 s -0.4 s Figure 4. Adaptive Baseline Selection: For each pixel in the new frame (top left), a different stereo-reference frame is selected, based on how long the pixel was visible (top right: the more yellow, the older the pixel.). Some of the reference frames are displayed below, the red regions were used for stereo comparisons. small. As the stereo accuracy depends on many factors and because this selection is done for each pixel independently, we employ the following heuristic: We use the oldest frame the pixel was observed in, where the disparity search range and the observation angle do not exceed a certain threshold (see Fig. 4). If a disparity search is unsuccessful (i.e., no good match is found), the pixel’s “age” is increased, such that subsequent disparity searches use newer frames where the pixel is likely to be still visible. 2.1.2 Stereo Matching Method We perform an exhaustive search for the pixel’s intensity along the epipolar line in the selected reference frame, and then perform a sub-pixel accurate localization of the matching disparity. If a prior inverse depth hypothesis is available, the search interval is limited by d 2σd, where d and σd de,e nthoete s etharec mean avnadl ssta lnimdaiterdd d beyv dia ±tion 2σ σof the prior hypothesis. Otherwise, the full disparity range is searched. In our implementation, we use the SSD error over five equidistant points on the epipolar line: While this significantly increases robustness in high-frequent image regions, it does not change the purely one-dimensional nature of this search. Furthermore, it is computationally efficient, as 4 out ± of 5 interpolated image values can be re-used for each SSD evaluation. 2.1.3 Uncertainty Estimation In this section, we use uncertainty propagation to derive an expression for the error variance σd2 on the inverse depth d. 11445511 In general this can be done by expressing the optimal inverse depth d∗ as a function of the noisy inputs here we consider the images I0, I1 themselves, their relative orientation ξ and the camera calibration in terms of a projection function π1 – d∗ = d(I0, I1, ξ, π) . The error-variance of d∗ is then given by σd2 = JdΣJdT, (1) (2) where Jd is the Jacobian of d, and Σ the covariance of the input-error. For more details on covariance propagation, including the derivation of this formula, we refer to [2]. For simplicity, the following analysis is performed for patchfree stereo, i.e., we consider only a point-wise search for a single intensity value along the epipolar line. For this analysis, we split the computation into three steps: First, the epipolar line in the reference frame is computed. Second, the best matching position λ∗ ∈ R along it (i.e., the disparity) is determined. Third, the i∈nv eRrse al depth d∗ is computed from the disparity λ∗ . The first two steps involve two independent error sources: the geometric error, which originates from noise on ξ and π and affects the first step, and the photometric error, which originates from noise in the images I0, I1 and affects the second step. The third step scales these errors by a factor, which depends on the baseline. Geometric disparity error. The geometric error is the error ?λ on the disparity λ∗ caused by noise on ξ and π. While it would be possible to model, propagate, and estimate the complete covariance on ξ and π, we found that the gain in accuracy does not justify the increase in computational complexity. We therefore use an intuitive approximation: Let the considered epipolar line segment L ⊂ R2 be deLfineted th by L := ?l0 + λ?llyx? |λ ∈ S? , (3) where λ is the disparity with search interval S, (lx , ly)T the normalized epipolar line direction and l0 the point corresponding to infinite depth. We now assume that only the absolute position of this line segment, i.e., l0 is subject to isotropic Gaussian noise ?l . As in practice we keep the searched epipolar line segments short, the influence of rotational error is small, making this a good approximation. Intuitively, a positioning error ?l on the epipolar line causes a small disparity error ?λ if the epipolar line is parallel to the image gradient, and a large one otherwise (see Fig. 5). This can be mathematically derived as follows: The image constrains the optimal disparity λ∗ to lie on a certain isocurve, i.e. a curve of equal intensity. We approximate 1In the linear case, this is the camera matrix K – in practice however, nonlinear distortion and other (unmodeled) effects also play a role. FiguLre5.Geo?l mλetricDigs,palrityEroL?rl:Influe?nλceofgasmla posi- tioning error ?l of the epipolar line on the disparity error ?λ . The dashed line represents the isocurve on which the matching point has to lie. ?λ is small if the epipolar line is parallel to the image gradient (left), and a large otherwise (right). this isocurve to be locally linear, i.e. the gradient direction to be locally constant. This gives l0 + λ∗ ?llxy? =! + γ?−gxgy?, g0 γ ∈ R (4) where g := (gx , gy) ?is the image gradient and g0 a point on the isoline. The influence of noise on the image values will be derived in the next paragraph, hence at this point g and g0 are assumed noise-free. Solving for λ gives the optimal disparity λ∗ in terms of the noisy input l0: λ∗(l0) =?g,g?g0,−l? l0? (5) Analogously to (2), the variance of the geometric disparity error can then be expressed as σλ2(ξ,π)= Jλ∗(l0)?σ0l2 σ0l2?JλT∗(l0)=?gσ,l 2?2, (6) where g is the normalized image gradient, lthe normalized epipolar line direction and σl2 the variance of ?l. Note that this error term solely originates from noise on the relative camera orientation and the camera calibration π, i.e., it is independent of image intensity noise. ξ Photometric disparity error. Intuitively, this error encodes that small image intensity errors have a large effect on the estimated disparity if the image gradient is small, and a small effect otherwise (see Fig. 6). Mathematically, this relation can be derived as follows. We seek the disparity λ∗ that minimizes the difference in intensities, i.e., λ∗ = mλin (iref − Ip(λ))2, (7) where iref is the reference intensity, and Ip(λ) the image intensity on the epipolar line at disparity λ. We assume a good initialization λ0 to be available from the exhaustive search. Using a first-order Taylor approximation for Ip gives λ∗(I) = λ0 + (iref − Ip(λ0)) g−p1, (8) where gp is the gradient of Ip, that is image gradient along the epipolar line. For clarity we only consider noise on iref and Ip(λ0) ; equivalent results are obtained in the general case when taking into account noise on the image values involved in the computation of gp.

Photometric Disparity Error: Noise ?i on the image intensity values causes a small disparity error ?λ if the image gradient along the epipolar line is large (left).

The respective error originates solely from noisy image intensity values, and hence is independent of the geometric disparity error. Pixel to inverse depth conversion. Using that, for small camera rotation, the inverse depth d is approximately proportional to the disparity λ, the observation variance of the inverse depth σd2,obs can be calculated using σd2,obs = α2 ?σ2λ(ξ,π) + σλ2(I)? , (10) where the proportionality ?constant α in th?e general, nonrectified case – is different for each pixel, and can be calculated from – α :=δδdλ, (11) where δd is the length of the searched inverse depth interval, and δλ the length of the searched epipolar line segment. While α is inversely linear in the length of the camera translation, it also depends on the translation direction and the pixel’s location in the image. When using an SSD error over multiple points along the epipolar line – as our implementation does – a good upper bound for the matching uncertainty is then given by ?min{σ2λ(ξ,π)} + min{σλ2(I)}? σd2,obs-SSD ≤ α2 , (12) where the min goes over all points included in the? SSD error. 2.1.4 Depth Observation Fusion After a depth observation for a pixel in the current image has been obtained, we integrate it into the depth map as follows: If no prior hypothesis for a pixel exists, we initialize it directly with the observation. Otherwise, the new observation is incorporated into the prior, i.e., the two distribu- tions are multiplied (corresponding to the update step in a Knoailsmya onb fsieltrvera)t:io Gniv Nen(do a, pσrio2o)r, d thiest priobsutetiroionr N is( gdipv,eσnp2 b)y and a N?σ2pdσo2p++ σ σo2o2dp,σ2σpp2+σo2 σo2?. 2.1.5 (13) Summary of Uncertainty-Aware Stereo New stereo observations are obtained on a per-pixel basis, adaptively selecting for each pixel a suitable reference frame and performing a one-dimensional search along the epipolar line. We identified the three major factors which determine the accuracy of such a stereo observation, i.e., • the photometric disparity error σλ2(ξ,π), depending on tphheo magnitude sofp trhiet image gradient along the epipolar line, • the geometric disparity error σλ2(I) ,depending on the athnegl gee bometewtereinc dthisep image gradient and the epipolar line (independent of the gradient magnitude), and • the pixel to inverse depth ratio α, depending on the camera etlra tons ilantvioenrs, eth dee pfothcal r length ,a dndep tehned pixel’s position. These three simple-to-compute and purely local criteria are used to determine for which pixel a stereo update is worth the computational cost. Further, the computed observation variance is then used to integrate the new measurements into the existing depth map. 2.2. Depth Map Propagation We continuously propagate the estimated inverse depth map from frame to frame, once the camera position of the next frame has been estimated. Based on the inverse depth estimate d0 for a pixel, the corresponding 3D point is calculated and projected into the new frame, providing an inverse depth estimate d1 in the new frame. The hypothesis is then assigned to the closest integer pixel position to eliminate discretization errors, the sub-pixel accurate image location of the projected point is kept, and re-used for the next propagation step. For propagating the inverse depth variance, we assume the camera rotation to be small. The new inverse depth d1 can then be approximated by – d1(d0) = (d0−1 − tz)−1, (14) where tz is the camera translation along the optical axis. The variance of d1 is hence given by σd21= Jd1σd20JTd1+ σp2=?dd01?4σd20+ σp2, (15) where σp2 is the prediction uncertainty, which directly corresponds to the prediction step in an extended Kalman filter. It can also be interpreted as keeping the variance on 11445533 in the top right shows the new frame I2 (x) without depth information.

Collision handling. At all times, we allow at most one inverse depth hypothesis per pixel: If two inverse depth hypothesis are propagated to the same pixel in the new frame, we distinguish between two cases: 1. if they are statistically similar, i.e., lie within 2σ bounds, they are treated as two independent observations of the pixel’s depth and fused according to (13). 2. otherwise, the point that is further away from the camera is assumed to be occluded, and is removed. 2.3. Depth Map Regularization For each frame – after all observations have been incorporated – we perform one regularization iteration by assign- ing each inverse depth value the average of the surrounding inverse depths, weighted by their respective inverse variance. To preserve sharp edges, if two adjacent inverse depth values are statistically different, i.e., are further away than 2σ, they do not contribute to one another. Note that the respective variances are not changed during regularization to account for the high correlation between neighboring hypotheses. Instead we use the minimal variance of all neighboring pixel when defining the stereo search range, and as a weighting factor for tracking (see Sec. 3). Outlier removal. To handle outliers, we continuously keep track of the validity of each inverse depth hypothesis in terms of the probability that it is an outlier, or has become invalid (e.g., due to occlusion or a moving object). For each successful stereo observation, this probability is decreased. It is increased for each failed stereo search, if the respective intensity changes significantly on propagation, or when the absolute image gradient falls below a given threshold. If, during regularization, the probability that all contributing neighbors are outliers i.e., the product of their individual outlier-probabilities rises above a given threshold, the hypothesis is removed. Equally, if for an “empty” pixel this product drops below a given threshold, a new hypothesis is created from the neighbors. This fills holes arising from the forward-warping nature of the propagation step, and dilates the semi-dense depth map to a small neighborhood around sharp image intensity edges, which signifi– – × cantly increases tracking and mapping robustness. 3. Dense Tracking Based on the inverse depth map of the previous frame, we estimate the camera pose of the current frame using dense image alignment. Such methods have previously been applied successfully (in real-time on a CPU) for tracking RGB-D cameras [7], which directly provide dense depth measurements along with the color image. It is based on the direct minimization of the photometric error ri (ξ) := (I2 (w(xi, di , ξ)) − I1 , (16) where the warp function w : Ω1 R R6 → Ω2 maps each point xi ∈ Ω1 in the reference× image RI1 →to Ωthe respective point w(x∈i, Ωdi, ξ) ∈ Ω2 in the new image I2.

Note that no depth information with respect t toh Ie2 p i sx required. To increase robustness to self-occlusion and moving objects, we apply a weighting scheme as proposed in [7]. Further, we add the variance of the inverse depth σd2i as an additional weighting term, making the tracking resistant to recently initialized and still inaccurate depth estimates from 11445544 (xi))2 Figure 8. Examples: Top: Camera images overlaid with the respective stimated semi-dense inverse depth map. Bot om: 3D view of tracked scene. Note the versatility of our approach: It accurately reconstructs and tracks through (outside) scenes with a large depth- variance, including far-away objects like clouds , as well as (indoor) scenes with little structure and close to no image corners / keypoints. More examples are shown in the attached video. the mapping process. The final energy that is minimized is hence given by E(ξ) :=?iα(rσid2(iξ))ri(ξ), (17) where α : R → R defines the weight for a given residual. Minimizing t h→is error can b thee interpreted as computing uthale. maximum likelihood estimator for ξ, assuming independent noise on the image intensity values. The resulting weighted least-squares problem is solved efficiently using an iteratively reweighted Gauss-Newton algorithm coupled with a coarse-to-fine approach, using four pyramid levels. Figure 7 shows an example of the tracking process. For further details on the minimization we refer to [1]. 4. System Overview Tracking and depth estimation is split into two separate threads: One continuously propagates the inverse depth map to the most recent tracked frame, updates it with stereocomparisons and partially regularizes it. The other simultaneously tracks each incoming frame on the most recent available depth map. While tracking is performed in real- time at 30Hz, one complete mapping iteration takes longer and is hence done at roughly 15Hz if the map is heavily populated, we adaptively reduce the number of stereo comparisons to maintain a constant frame-rate. For stereo observations, a buffer of up to 100 past frames is kept, automatically removing those that are used least. We use a standard, keypoint-based method to obtain the relative camera pose between two initial frames, which are then used to initialize the inverse depth map needed for tracking successive frames. From this point onward, our method is entirely self-contained. In preliminary experiments, we found that in most cases our approach is even able to recover from random or extremely inaccurate initial depth maps, indicating that the keypoint-based initialization might become superfluous in the future.

Results We have tested our approach on both publicly available benchmark sequences, as well as live, using a hand-held camera. Some examples are shown in Fig. 8. Note that our method does not attempt to build a global map, i.e., once a point leaves the field of view of the camera or becomes occluded, the respective depth value is deleted. All experiments are performed on a standard consumer laptop with Intel i7 quad-core CPU. In a preprocessing step, we rectify all images such that a pinhole camera-model can be applied. 5.1. RGB-D Benchmark Sequences As basis for a quantitative evaluation and to facilitate reproducibility and easy comparison with other methods, we use the TUM RGB-D benchmark [16]. For tracking and mapping we only use the gray-scale images; for the very first frame however the provided depth image is used as initialization. Our method (like any monocular visual odometry method) fails in case of pure camera rotation, as the depth of new regions cannot be determined. The achieved tracking accuracy for two feasible sequences that is, sequences which do not contain strong camera rotation without simultaneous translation is given in Table 1. For comparison we also list the accuracy from (1) a state-of-the-art, dense RGB-D odometry [7], and (2) a state-of-the-art, keypointbased monocular SLAM system (PTAM, [8]). We initialize PTAM using the built-in stereo initializer, and perform a 7DoF (rigid body plus scale) alignment to the ground truth trajectory. Figure 9 shows the tracked camera trajectory for fr2/desk.

The keypoint-based approach [8] proves to be significantly less accurate and robust; it consistently failed after a few seconds for the second sequence. 5.2. Additional Test Sequences To analyze our approach in more detail, we recorded additional challenging sequences with the corresponding ground truth trajectory in a motion capture studio. Figure 10 shows an extract from the video, as well as the tracked and the ground-truth camera position over time. As can be seen from the figure, our approach is able to maintain a reasonably dense depth map at all times and the estimated camera trajectory matches closely the ground truth. 6. Conclusion In this paper we proposed a novel visual odometry method for a monocular camera, which does not require discrete features. In contrast to previous work on dense tracking and mapping, our approach is based on probabilistic depth map estimation and fusion over time. Depth measurements are obtained from patch-free stereo matching in different reference frames at a suitable baseline, which are selected on a per-pixel basis. To our knowledge, this is the first featureless monocular visual odometry method which runs in real-time on a CPU. In our experiments, we showed that the tracking performance of our approach is comparable to that of fully dense methods without requiring a depth sensor. References [1] S. Baker and I. Matthews.

<p>Author: Philipp Heise, Sebastian Klose, Brian Jensen, Alois Knoll</p><p>Abstract: Most stereo correspondence algorithms match support windows at integer-valued disparities and assume a constant disparity value within the support window. The recently proposed PatchMatch stereo algorithm [7] overcomes this limitation of previous algorithms by directly estimating planes. This work presents a method that integrates the PatchMatch stereo algorithm into a variational smoothing formulation using quadratic relaxation. The resulting algorithm allows the explicit regularization of the disparity and normal gradients using the estimated plane parameters. Evaluation of our method in the Middlebury benchmark shows that our method outperforms the traditional integer-valued disparity strategy as well as the original algorithm and its variants in sub-pixel accurate disparity estimation.</p><p>3 0.7673049 <a title="88-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Rotational_Stereo_Model_Based_on_XSlit_Imaging.html">28 iccv-2013-A Rotational Stereo Model Based on XSlit Imaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinwei Ye, Yu Ji, Jingyi Yu</p><p>Abstract: Traditional stereo matching assumes perspective viewing cameras under a translational motion: the second camera is translated away from the first one to create parallax. In this paper, we investigate a different, rotational stereo model on a special multi-perspective camera, the XSlit camera [9, 24]. We show that rotational XSlit (R-XSlit) stereo can be effectively created by fixing the sensor and slit locations but switching the two slits’ directions. We first derive the epipolar geometry of R-XSlit in the 4D light field ray space. Our derivation leads to a simple but effective scheme for locating corresponding epipolar “curves ”. To conduct stereo matching, we further derive a new disparity term in our model and develop a patch-based graph-cut solution. To validate our theory, we assemble an XSlit lens by using a pair of cylindrical lenses coupled with slit-shaped apertures. The XSlit lens can be mounted on commodity cameras where the slit directions are adjustable to form desirable R-XSlit pairs. We show through experiments that R-XSlitprovides apotentially advantageous imaging system for conducting fixed-location, dynamic baseline stereo.</p><p>4 0.63591737 <a title="88-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Line_Assisted_Light_Field_Triangulation_and_Stereo_Matching.html">252 iccv-2013-Line Assisted Light Field Triangulation and Stereo Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhan Yu, Xinqing Guo, Haibing Lin, Andrew Lumsdaine, Jingyi Yu</p><p>Abstract: Light fields are image-based representations that use densely sampled rays as a scene description. In this paper, we explore geometric structures of 3D lines in ray space for improving light field triangulation and stereo matching. The triangulation problem aims to fill in the ray space with continuous and non-overlapping simplices anchored at sampled points (rays). Such a triangulation provides a piecewise-linear interpolant useful for light field superresolution. We show that the light field space is largely bilinear due to 3D line segments in the scene, and direct triangulation of these bilinear subspaces leads to large errors. We instead present a simple but effective algorithm to first map bilinear subspaces to line constraints and then apply Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT). Based on our analysis, we further develop a novel line-assisted graphcut (LAGC) algorithm that effectively encodes 3D line constraints into light field stereo matching. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that both our triangulation and LAGC algorithms outperform state-of-the-art solutions in accuracy and visual quality.</p><p>5 0.63577759 <a title="88-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Local_Signal_Equalization_for_Correspondence_Matching.html">255 iccv-2013-Local Signal Equalization for Correspondence Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Derek Bradley, Thabo Beeler</p><p>Abstract: Correspondence matching is one of the most common problems in computer vision, and it is often solved using photo-consistency of local regions. These approaches typically assume that the frequency content in the local region is consistent in the image pair, such that matching is performed on similar signals. However, in many practical situations this is not the case, for example with low depth of field cameras a scene point may be out of focus in one view and in-focus in the other, causing a mismatch of frequency signals. Furthermore, this mismatch can vary spatially over the entire image. In this paper we propose a local signal equalization approach for correspondence matching. Using a measure of local image frequency, we equalize local signals using an efficient scale-space image representation such that their frequency contents are optimally suited for matching. Our approach allows better correspondence matching, which we demonstrate with a number of stereo reconstruction examples on synthetic and real datasets.</p><p>6 0.60515416 <a title="88-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Semi-dense_Visual_Odometry_for_a_Monocular_Camera.html">382 iccv-2013-Semi-dense Visual Odometry for a Monocular Camera</a></p>

<p>Author: Xinxiao Wu, Han Wang, Cuiwei Liu, Yunde Jia</p><p>Abstract: In cross-view action recognition, “what you saw” in one view is different from “what you recognize ” in another view. The data distribution even the feature space can change from one view to another due to the appearance and motion of actions drastically vary across different views. In this paper, we address the problem of transferring action models learned in one view (source view) to another different view (target view), where action instances from these two views are represented by heterogeneous features. A novel learning method, called Heterogeneous Transfer Discriminantanalysis of Canonical Correlations (HTDCC), is proposed to learn a discriminative common feature space for linking source and target views to transfer knowledge between them. Two projection matrices that respectively map data from source and target views into the common space are optimized via simultaneously minimizing the canonical correlations of inter-class samples and maximizing the intraclass canonical correlations. Our model is neither restricted to corresponding action instances in the two views nor restricted to the same type of feature, and can handle only a few or even no labeled samples available in the target view. To reduce the data distribution mismatch between the source and target views in the commonfeature space, a nonparametric criterion is included in the objective function. We additionally propose a joint weight learning method to fuse multiple source-view action classifiers for recognition in the target view. Different combination weights are assigned to different source views, with each weight presenting how contributive the corresponding source view is to the target view. The proposed method is evaluated on the IXMAS multi-view dataset and achieves promising results.</p><p>2 0.9046855 <a title="88-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Robust_Non-negative_Dictionary_Learning_for_Visual_Tracking.html">298 iccv-2013-Online Robust Non-negative Dictionary Learning for Visual Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Naiyan Wang, Jingdong Wang, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the visual tracking problem in video sequences and presents a novel robust sparse tracker under the particle filter framework. In particular, we propose an online robust non-negative dictionary learning algorithm for updating the object templates so that each learned template can capture a distinctive aspect of the tracked object. Another appealing property of this approach is that it can automatically detect and reject the occlusion and cluttered background in a principled way. In addition, we propose a new particle representation formulation using the Huber loss function. The advantage is that it can yield robust estimation without using trivial templates adopted by previous sparse trackers, leading to faster computation. We also reveal the equivalence between this new formulation and the previous one which uses trivial templates. The proposed tracker is empirically compared with state-of-the-art trackers on some challenging video sequences. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons show that our proposed tracker is superior and more stable.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.89613742 <a title="88-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Constant_Time_Weighted_Median_Filtering_for_Stereo_Matching_and_Beyond.html">88 iccv-2013-Constant Time Weighted Median Filtering for Stereo Matching and Beyond</a></p>

<p>Author: Siyu Tang, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Anton Milan, Konrad Schindler, Stefan Roth, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: People tracking in crowded real-world scenes is challenging due to frequent and long-term occlusions. Recent tracking methods obtain the image evidence from object (people) detectors, but typically use off-the-shelf detectors and treat them as black box components. In this paper we argue that for best performance one should explicitly train people detectors on failure cases of the overall tracker instead. To that end, we first propose a novel joint people detector that combines a state-of-the-art single person detector with a detector for pairs of people, which explicitly exploits common patterns of person-person occlusions across multiple viewpoints that are a frequent failure case for tracking in crowded scenes. To explicitly address remaining failure modes of the tracker we explore two methods. First, we analyze typical failures of trackers and train a detector explicitly on these cases. And second, we train the detector with the people tracker in the loop, focusing on the most common tracker failures. We show that our joint multi-person detector significantly improves both de- tection accuracy as well as tracker performance, improving the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks.</p><p>5 0.84491479 <a title="88-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Finding_Actors_and_Actions_in_Movies.html">166 iccv-2013-Finding Actors and Actions in Movies</a></p>
<p>Author: P. Bojanowski, F. Bach, I. Laptev, J. Ponce, C. Schmid, J. Sivic</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning a joint model of actors and actions in movies using weak supervision provided by scripts. Specifically, we extract actor/action pairs from the script and use them as constraints in a discriminative clustering framework. The corresponding optimization problem is formulated as a quadratic program under linear constraints. People in video are represented by automatically extracted and tracked faces together with corresponding motion features. First, we apply the proposed framework to the task of learning names of characters in the movie and demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods used for this task. Second, we explore the joint actor/action constraint and show its advantage for weakly supervised action learning. We validate our method in the challenging setting of localizing and recognizing characters and their actions in feature length movies Casablanca and American Beauty.</p><p>6 0.83744431 <a title="88-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Action_Recognition_and_Localization_by_Hierarchical_Space-Time_Segments.html">37 iccv-2013-Action Recognition and Localization by Hierarchical Space-Time Segments</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthijs Douze, Jérôme Revaud, Cordelia Schmid, Hervé Jégou</p><p>Abstract: This paper makes two complementary contributions to event retrieval in large collections of videos. First, we propose hyper-pooling strategies that encode the frame descriptors into a representation of the video sequence in a stable manner. Our best choices compare favorably with regular pooling techniques based on k-means quantization. Second, we introduce a technique to improve the ranking. It can be interpreted either as a query expansion method or as a similarity adaptation based on the local context of the query video descriptor. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our methods are complementary and improve event retrieval results, without sacrificing efficiency.</p><p>3 0.12929285 <a title="419-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Offline_Mobile_Instance_Retrieval_with_a_Small_Memory_Footprint.html">294 iccv-2013-Offline Mobile Instance Retrieval with a Small Memory Footprint</a></p>
<p>Author: Jayaguru Panda, Michael S. Brown, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: Existing mobile image instance retrieval applications assume a network-based usage where image features are sent to a server to query an online visual database. In this scenario, there are no restrictions on the size of the visual database. This paper, however, examines how to perform this same task offline, where the entire visual index must reside on the mobile device itself within a small memory footprint. Such solutions have applications on location recognition and product recognition. Mobile instance retrieval requires a significant reduction in the visual index size. To achieve this, we describe a set of strategies that can reduce the visual index up to 60-80 compared to a scatannd raerddu iens tthaen vceis rueatrli ienvdaelx xim upple tom 6en0t-8at0io ×n found on ddte osk atops or servers. While our proposed reduction steps affect the overall mean Average Precision (mAP), they are able to maintain a good Precision for the top K results (PK). We argue that for such offline application, maintaining a good PK is sufficient. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on several standard databases. A working application designed for a remote historical site is also presented. This application is able to reduce an 50,000 image index structure to 25 MBs while providing a precision of 97% for P10 and 100% for P1.</p><p>4 0.12316339 <a title="419-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Mining_Multiple_Queries_for_Image_Retrieval%3A_On-the-Fly_Learning_of_an_Object-Specific_Mid-level_Representation.html">266 iccv-2013-Mining Multiple Queries for Image Retrieval: On-the-Fly Learning of an Object-Specific Mid-level Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Basura Fernando, Tinne Tuytelaars</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a new method for object retrieval starting from multiple query images. The use of multiple queries allows for a more expressive formulation of the query object including, e.g., different viewpoints and/or viewing conditions. This, in turn, leads to more diverse and more accurate retrieval results. When no query images are available to the user, they can easily be retrieved from the internet using a standard image search engine. In particular, we propose a new method based on pattern mining. Using the minimal description length principle, we derive the most suitable set of patterns to describe the query object, with patterns corresponding to local feature configurations. This results in apowerful object-specific mid-level image representation. The archive can then be searched efficiently for similar images based on this representation, using a combination of two inverted file systems. Since the patterns already encode local spatial information, good results on several standard image retrieval datasets are obtained even without costly re-ranking based on geometric verification.</p><p>5 0.1091212 <a title="419-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Query-Adaptive_Asymmetrical_Dissimilarities_for_Visual_Object_Retrieval.html">334 iccv-2013-Query-Adaptive Asymmetrical Dissimilarities for Visual Object Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Cai-Zhi Zhu, Hervé Jégou, Shin'Ichi Satoh</p><p>Abstract: Visual object retrieval aims at retrieving, from a collection of images, all those in which a given query object appears. It is inherently asymmetric: the query object is mostly included in the database image, while the converse is not necessarily true. However, existing approaches mostly compare the images with symmetrical measures, without considering the different roles of query and database. This paper first measure the extent of asymmetry on large-scale public datasets reflecting this task. Considering the standard bag-of-words representation, we then propose new asymmetrical dissimilarities accounting for the different inlier ratios associated with query and database images. These asymmetrical measures depend on the query, yet they are compatible with an inverted file structure, without noticeably impacting search efficiency. Our experiments show the benefit of our approach, and show that the visual object retrieval task is better treated asymmetrically, in the spirit of state-of-the-art text retrieval.</p><p>6 0.10504554 <a title="419-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic-Aware_Co-indexing_for_Image_Retrieval.html">378 iccv-2013-Semantic-Aware Co-indexing for Image Retrieval</a></p>

<p>Author: Yannis Avrithis</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by the close relation between nearest neighbor search and clustering in high-dimensional spaces as well as the success of one helping to solve the other, we introduce a new paradigm where both problems are solved simultaneously. Our solution is recursive, not in the size of input data but in the number of dimensions. One result is a clustering algorithm that is tuned to small codebooks but does not need all data in memory at the same time and is practically constant in the data size. As a by-product, a tree structure performs either exact or approximate quantization on trained centroids, the latter being not very precise but extremely fast. A lesser contribution is a new indexing scheme for image retrieval that exploits multiple small codebooks to provide an arbitrarily fine partition of the descriptor space. Large scale experiments on public datasets exhibit state of the art performance and remarkable generalization.</p><p>6 0.74858427 <a title="419-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Stable_Hyper-pooling_and_Query_Expansion_for_Event_Detection.html">400 iccv-2013-Stable Hyper-pooling and Query Expansion for Event Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Vicente Ordonez, Jia Deng, Yejin Choi, Alexander C. Berg, Tamara L. Berg</p><p>Abstract: Entry level categories the labels people will use to name an object were originally defined and studied by psychologists in the 1980s. In this paper we study entrylevel categories at a large scale and learn the first models for predicting entry-level categories for images. Our models combine visual recognition predictions with proxies for word “naturalness ” mined from the enormous amounts of text on the web. We demonstrate the usefulness of our models for predicting nouns (entry-level words) associated with images by people. We also learn mappings between concepts predicted by existing visual recognition systems and entry-level concepts that could be useful for improving human-focused applications such as natural language image description or retrieval. – –</p><p>2 0.70385796 <a title="419-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Super-resolution_via_Transform-Invariant_Group-Sparse_Regularization.html">408 iccv-2013-Super-resolution via Transform-Invariant Group-Sparse Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Emmanuel J. Candès</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework to super-resolve planar regions found in urban scenes and other man-made environments by taking into account their 3D geometry. Such regions have highly structured straight edges, but this prior is challenging to exploit due to deformations induced by the projection onto the imaging plane. Our method factors out such deformations by using recently developed tools based on convex optimization to learn a transform that maps the image to a domain where its gradient has a simple group-sparse structure. This allows to obtain a novel convex regularizer that enforces global consistency constraints between the edges of the image. Computational experiments with real images show that this data-driven approach to the design of regularizers promoting transform-invariant group sparsity is very effective at high super-resolution factors. We view our approach as complementary to most recent superresolution methods, which tend to focus on hallucinating high-frequency textures.</p><p>3 0.69516879 <a title="419-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search_for_Scheduling_Activity_Recognition.html">274 iccv-2013-Monte Carlo Tree Search for Scheduling Activity Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohamed R. Amer, Sinisa Todorovic, Alan Fern, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an efficient approach to video parsing. Our videos show a number of co-occurring individual and group activities. To address challenges of the domain, we use an expressive spatiotemporal AND-OR graph (ST-AOG) that jointly models activity parts, their spatiotemporal relations, and context, as well as enables multitarget tracking. The standard ST-AOG inference is prohibitively expensive in our setting, since it would require running a multitude of detectors, and tracking their detections in a long video footage. This problem is addressed by formulating a cost-sensitive inference of ST-AOG as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For querying an activity in the video, MCTS optimally schedules a sequence of detectors and trackers to be run, and where they should be applied in the space-time volume. Evaluation on the benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCTS enables two-magnitude speed-ups without compromising accuracy relative to the standard cost-insensitive inference.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.66630465 <a title="419-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-To_Aggregate_or_Not_to_aggregate%3A_Selective_Match_Kernels_for_Image_Search.html">419 iccv-2013-To Aggregate or Not to aggregate: Selective Match Kernels for Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Giorgos Tolias, Yannis Avrithis, Hervé Jégou</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers a family of metrics to compare images based on their local descriptors. It encompasses the VLAD descriptor and matching techniques such as Hamming Embedding. Making the bridge between these approaches leads us to propose a match kernel that takes the best of existing techniques by combining an aggregation procedure with a selective match kernel. Finally, the representation underpinning this kernel is approximated, providing a large scale image search both precise and scalable, as shown by our experiments on several benchmarks.</p><p>5 0.6551435 <a title="419-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Finding_Actors_and_Actions_in_Movies.html">166 iccv-2013-Finding Actors and Actions in Movies</a></p>
<p>Author: P. Bojanowski, F. Bach, I. Laptev, J. Ponce, C. Schmid, J. Sivic</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning a joint model of actors and actions in movies using weak supervision provided by scripts. Specifically, we extract actor/action pairs from the script and use them as constraints in a discriminative clustering framework. The corresponding optimization problem is formulated as a quadratic program under linear constraints. People in video are represented by automatically extracted and tracked faces together with corresponding motion features. First, we apply the proposed framework to the task of learning names of characters in the movie and demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods used for this task. Second, we explore the joint actor/action constraint and show its advantage for weakly supervised action learning. We validate our method in the challenging setting of localizing and recognizing characters and their actions in feature length movies Casablanca and American Beauty.</p><p>6 0.62077075 <a title="419-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Minimal_Basis_Facility_Location_for_Subspace_Segmentation.html">264 iccv-2013-Minimal Basis Facility Location for Subspace Segmentation</a></p>

[sent-1, score-0.149]
</p><p>2 It encompasses the VLAD descriptor and matching techniques such as Hamming Embedding. [sent-2, score-0.105]
</p><p>3 Making the bridge between these approaches leads us to propose a match kernel that takes the best of existing techniques by combining an aggregation procedure with a selective match kernel. [sent-3, score-0.303]
</p><p>4 It employs a visual vocabulary to quantize a set of local descriptors and to produce a single vector that represents the image. [sent-9, score-0.206]
</p><p>5 In a query by content scenario [25], which is the focus of our paper, large vocabularies make the search efficient [17, 22, 16], thanks to inverted file structures [24] that exploit the sparsity ofthe representation. [sent-13, score-0.245]
</p><p>6 This is done by exploiting additional geometrical information [22, 18, 26] or applying query expansion techniques [6, 27]. [sent-17, score-0.195]
</p><p>7 This is done by multiple assignment [23, 12], or by exploiting a more precise representation of the individual local descriptors, such as binary codes in the so-called Hamming Embedding (HE) method [12],  or by integrating some information about the neighborhood of the descriptor [3 1]. [sent-22, score-0.141]
</p><p>8 All these approaches implicitly rely on approximate pair-wise matching of the query descriptors with those of the database images. [sent-23, score-0.231]
</p><p>9 In a concurrent effort to scale to even larger databases, recent encoding techniques such as Fisher kernels [19, 21], local linear coding [30] or the “vector or locally aggregated descriptors” (VLAD) [13], depart from the initial BOW framework by introducing alternative encoding schemes. [sent-24, score-0.262]
</p><p>10 By compressing the resulting vector representation [13, 20], the local descriptors are not considered individually. [sent-25, score-0.127]
</p><p>11 Our paper introduces a framework to bridge the gap between the “matching-based” approaches, such as HE, and the recent aggregated representations, in particular VLAD. [sent-27, score-0.164]
</p><p>12 For this purpose, we introduce in Section 2 a class of match kernels that includes both matching-based and aggregated methods for unsupervised image search. [sent-28, score-0.296]
</p><p>13 We then discuss and analyze in Section 3 two key differences between matching-based and aggregated approaches. [sent-29, score-0.164]
</p><p>14 First, we consider the selectivity of the matching function, i. [sent-30, score-0.237]
</p><p>15 Second, the aggregation (or pooling) operator used in  BoW, VLAD or in the Fisher vector, is not considered in pure matching approaches such as HE. [sent-34, score-0.13]
</p><p>16 , [11, 21]) introduced to handle the non-iid statistical behavior of local descriptors, also called the burstiness phenomenon [11]. [sent-37, score-0.161]
</p><p>17 It combines an aggregation scheme with a selective kernel. [sent-40, score-0.174]
</p><p>18 This vector representation is advantageously compressed to drastically reduce the memory requirements, while also improving the search efficiency. [sent-41, score-0.143]
</p><p>19 A framework for match kernels This section first describes the class of match kernels that we will analyze in this paper. [sent-46, score-0.264]
</p><p>20 The descriptors are quantized by a k-means quantizer q : Rd → C  ⊂  Rd  x → q(x)  (1)  where C = {c1, . [sent-53, score-0.108]
</p><p>21 We denote by Xc = {x ∈ X : q(x) = c} the subset of descriptors in X that are assigned to a particular visual word c. [sent-57, score-0.191]
</p><p>22 c∈C  where function M is defined between two sets of descriptors Xc, Yc assigned to the same visual word. [sent-60, score-0.141]
</p><p>23 The scalar wc is a constant that depends on visual word c, for instance it integrates the inverse document frequency (IDF) weighting term. [sent-62, score-0.151]
</p><p>24 The BOW representation [25, 7] represents each local descriptor x solely by its visual word. [sent-70, score-0.103]
</p><p>25 Hamming Embedding (HE) [10, 12] is a matching model that extends BOW by representing each local descriptor x with both its quantized value q(x) and a binary code bx of B bits. [sent-78, score-0.122]
</p><p>26 It computes the scores between all pairs of descriptors assigned to the same visual word, as  M(Xc,Yc)  = ? [sent-79, score-0.141]
</p><p>27 VLAD [13] aggregates the descriptors associated with a given visual word to produce a d k vector representation. [sent-97, score-0.191]
</p><p>28 Since the similarity of two VLADs is measured by the dot product, it is easy to show that VLAD corresponds to a match kernel of the form pro−  posed in Equation (2): V(X)? [sent-104, score-0.121]
</p><p>29 Its effect is similar to burstiness handling in [11]. [sent-117, score-0.161]
</p><p>30 Once individual contributions are aggregated per cell as in the HE model of Equation (5), one solution is to down-weight highly populated cells. [sent-120, score-0.223]
</p><p>31 Investigating selectivity and aggregation The three match kernels presented above share some similarities, in particular the fact that the set of descriptors is partitioned into cells and that only vectors lying in the same cell contribute to the overall similarity. [sent-124, score-0.605]
</p><p>32 Towards a common model The non-aggregated kernels individually match all the elements occurring in the same Voronoi cell. [sent-132, score-0.132]
</p><p>33 (14)  This equation encompasses all the variants discussed so far, excluding the burstiness post-processing considered in  Equation (13). [sent-141, score-0.247]
</p><p>34 They are classified as non-aggregated MN (14) and aggregated kernels MA (15), or possibly both. [sent-148, score-0.242]
</p><p>35 φ(x) : scalar or vector representation of descriptor x. [sent-149, score-0.112]
</p><p>36 σ(u) : scalar selectivity of u, where u is assumed normalized in [−1 , 1] . [sent-150, score-0.239]
</p><p>37 ψ(z) : representation of aggregated descriptor z per cell. [sent-151, score-0.255]
</p><p>38 ˆx  and σ : R → R is a scalar selectivity function. [sent-157, score-0.239]
</p><p>39 The aggregated kernels, in contrast, are written as  MA(Xc,Yc) = σ⎨⎧ψ? [sent-159, score-0.164]
</p><p>40 Φ(Xc) is the aggregated vector representation of a set Xc of descriptors in a cell, such that Φ(∅) = 0 and  Φ(Xc) = ψ? [sent-170, score-0.291]
</p><p>41 In contrast to Equation (14), there is at most a single match between aggregated representations Φ(Xc) and Φ(Yc), and selectivity σ is applied after aggregation. [sent-175, score-0.432]
</p><p>42 Non-aggregated matching  SMK  We introduce a selective match kernel (SMK) in this subsection. [sent-183, score-0.165]
</p><p>43 It is motivated by the observation that VLAD employs a linear weighting scheme in Equation (12) for the  contribution of individual matching pairs (x, y) to M, while HE applies a non-linear weighting function σ to the similarity φ(x)? [sent-184, score-0.153]
</p><p>44 Matchingfeatureswithdescriptosa ignedtohesame  visual word and similarity above the threshold. [sent-191, score-0.112]
</p><p>45 Without loss of generality, we consider a thresholded polynomial selectivity function σα : R → R+ of the form  σα(u) =? [sent-196, score-0.234]
</p><p>46 A larger α increases the selectivity and drastically down-weights false correspondences. [sent-202, score-0.214]
</p><p>47 It also differs from VLAD, considered as a matching function, by the selectivity function σ and because we normalize the residual vector. [sent-215, score-0.283]
</p><p>48 Aggregated selective match kernel ASMK SMK weights the contributions of individual matches with a non-linear function. [sent-219, score-0.169]
</p><p>49 We now propose to apply a selective function after aggregating the different vectors per cell. [sent-220, score-0.131]
</p><p>50 (21)  describes all the descriptors assigned to the cell c. [sent-230, score-0.144]
</p><p>51 The selectivity function σα is applied after aggregation and normalization, therefore the matching kernel MA becomes ASMK(Xc, Yc) =  Vˆ (Xc)  σα  ? [sent-231, score-0.383]
</p><p>52 Normalization per visual word was recently proposed by a concurrent work [2] with comparatively small vocabularies. [sent-240, score-0.126]
</p><p>53 resembles binary BOW [25] or max pooling [4] which both tackle burstiness by accounting at most one vote per visual word. [sent-245, score-0.217]
</p><p>54 Although the choice of binarization was adopted for the sake of compactness, a question arises: What is the performance of the kernel if the full vector are employed instead? [sent-252, score-0.114]
</p><p>55 of SMK is similar to HE, the only difference is the inner product formulation and the choice of the selectivity function σα in Equation (18):  SMK? [sent-260, score-0.256]
</p><p>56 of the aggregated version ASMK is obtained by binarizing V (Xc) before applying the selectivity function:  ASMK? [sent-271, score-0.378]
</p><p>57 Most of our results are presented without spatial verification or query expansion (QE) to focus on the quality of the initial ranking, before re-ranking by these complementary methods. [sent-287, score-0.226]
</p><p>58 In contrast to VLAD, we apply our methods with relatively large vocabularies aiming at best performance for object retrieval, and use an inverted file struc-  ture to exploit the sparsity ofthe BOW based representation. [sent-315, score-0.126]
</p><p>59 With SMK and ASMK, each dimension of vectors φ(x) or Φ(Xc) respectively, is uniformly quantized with 8 bits and stored in the inverted file. [sent-316, score-0.147]
</p><p>60 We further combine our proposed method with multiple assignment (MA), which is applied on query side only [12]. [sent-321, score-0.174]
</p><p>61 We replicate each descriptor vector and assign each instance to a different visual word. [sent-322, score-0.101]
</p><p>62 When it is stated that multiple assignment is used in our experiment, 5 nearest visual words are used. [sent-323, score-0.11]
</p><p>63 Thus, we combine them with the intra-image burstiness normalization [11]. [sent-327, score-0.217]
</p><p>64 This is done to compare with our aggregated methods which also deal with the burstiness phenomenon. [sent-328, score-0.325]
</p><p>65 We will refer to burstiness normalization as BURST in the experiments. [sent-329, score-0.217]
</p><p>66 We combine our methods with local visual query expansion [27] to futher improve the performance. [sent-331, score-0.229]
</p><p>67 Similarly to other visual query expansion methods [6, 1], we apply spatial verification [22] to the 100 top ranked images in order to identify the ones that are truly relevant. [sent-333, score-0.26]
</p><p>68 The estimated geometric transformation estimated for verified images is used to back-project features of database images to the query image. [sent-338, score-0.139]
</p><p>69 Features projected out of the query region are discarded. [sent-339, score-0.119]
</p><p>70 We select them in a  way such that the number of new visual words that are not present in the query image are equal to the number of original visual words of the query image. [sent-341, score-0.366]
</p><p>71 Descriptors assigned to those visual words are merged with the query features, and aggregation per visual word is applied once more. [sent-342, score-0.405]
</p><p>72 The new expanded query is of the same nature as the original one and can be issued to the same indexing structure. [sent-343, score-0.136]
</p><p>73 For the aggregated methods descriptors of database images are aggregated off-line and then stored in the inverted file. [sent-345, score-0.502]
</p><p>74 On query time, query descriptors are aggregated in the same way. [sent-346, score-0.491]
</p><p>75 In the case of multiple assignment, aggregation is similarly applied once the aforementioned replication of descriptors is performed. [sent-347, score-0.196]
</p><p>76 Query expansion uses spatial verification which requires the construction of tentative correspondences. [sent-348, score-0.107]
</p><p>77 In the aggregated scheme, when two aggregated features are matched then correspondences are formed between all original features being aggregated of query and database image. [sent-349, score-0.611]
</p><p>78 Figure 3 shows the impact of the parameter α associated with our selectivity function. [sent-353, score-0.243]

</p><p>80 Impact of threshold value τ on Oxford dataset for SMK, SMK with burstiness normalization and ASMK. [sent-364, score-0.248]
</p><p>81 Ratio of memory requirements after aggregation (ASMK or ASMK? [sent-367, score-0.138]
</p><p>82 In the rest of our experiments we will set the threshold value equal to 0, maintaining best performance but also reducing the number of matches obtained from the inverted file. [sent-376, score-0.139]
</p><p>83 Remark also that ASMK outperforms SMK combined with burstiness normalization [11]. [sent-377, score-0.217]
</p><p>84 Our methods being employed with descriptor information and not only visual words, do not appear to be too sensitive to the vocabulary size. [sent-381, score-0.148]
</p><p>85 SMK and ASMK with single assignment and the 8k vocabulary achieve 74. [sent-385, score-0.12]
</p><p>86 We have measured the amount of descriptors being aggregated in each case by the memory ratio which is defined as the ratio of the total number of descriptors indexed after aggregation to the ones before aggregation. [sent-388, score-0.502]
</p><p>87 Our aggregated scheme not only improves performance, but also saves memory. [sent-390, score-0.182]
</p><p>88 The use of the selectivity function allows the use of more features which also includes more false matches, but these are properly down-weighted. [sent-406, score-0.214]
</p><p>89 Comparison to the state of the art Table 4 summarizes the performance of our methods for single and multiple assignment and compares to state of the art methods which do not apply any spatial re-ranking or query expansion. [sent-409, score-0.21]
</p><p>90 We further combine ASMK with the query expansion scheme previously described and achieve mAP equal to 87. [sent-413, score-0.231]
</p><p>91 These scores are better than the best scores reported with query expansion on these datasets [16]. [sent-419, score-0.195]
</p><p>92 Number of features indexed without (SMK) and with (ASMK) aggregation are reported. [sent-459, score-0.129]
</p><p>93 Conclusions This paper draws a framework for well known matching kernels such as BOW, HE and VLAD. [sent-463, score-0.101]
</p><p>94 We exploit the use of a selectivity function and show how aggregation per visual word can deal with burstiness. [sent-465, score-0.427]
</p><p>95 Finally, our methods combined with a query expansion scheme exhibit superior performance than state of the art methods. [sent-466, score-0.231]

<p>Author: Matthijs Douze, Jérôme Revaud, Cordelia Schmid, Hervé Jégou</p><p>Abstract: This paper makes two complementary contributions to event retrieval in large collections of videos. First, we propose hyper-pooling strategies that encode the frame descriptors into a representation of the video sequence in a stable manner. Our best choices compare favorably with regular pooling techniques based on k-means quantization. Second, we introduce a technique to improve the ranking. It can be interpreted either as a query expansion method or as a similarity adaptation based on the local context of the query video descriptor. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our methods are complementary and improve event retrieval results, without sacrificing efficiency.</p><p>3 0.13168237 <a title="419-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Mining_Multiple_Queries_for_Image_Retrieval%3A_On-the-Fly_Learning_of_an_Object-Specific_Mid-level_Representation.html">266 iccv-2013-Mining Multiple Queries for Image Retrieval: On-the-Fly Learning of an Object-Specific Mid-level Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Basura Fernando, Tinne Tuytelaars</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a new method for object retrieval starting from multiple query images. The use of multiple queries allows for a more expressive formulation of the query object including, e.g., different viewpoints and/or viewing conditions. This, in turn, leads to more diverse and more accurate retrieval results. When no query images are available to the user, they can easily be retrieved from the internet using a standard image search engine. In particular, we propose a new method based on pattern mining. Using the minimal description length principle, we derive the most suitable set of patterns to describe the query object, with patterns corresponding to local feature configurations. This results in apowerful object-specific mid-level image representation. The archive can then be searched efficiently for similar images based on this representation, using a combination of two inverted file systems. Since the patterns already encode local spatial information, good results on several standard image retrieval datasets are obtained even without costly re-ranking based on geometric verification.</p><p>4 0.11521695 <a title="419-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Offline_Mobile_Instance_Retrieval_with_a_Small_Memory_Footprint.html">294 iccv-2013-Offline Mobile Instance Retrieval with a Small Memory Footprint</a></p>
<p>Author: Jayaguru Panda, Michael S. Brown, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: Existing mobile image instance retrieval applications assume a network-based usage where image features are sent to a server to query an online visual database. In this scenario, there are no restrictions on the size of the visual database. This paper, however, examines how to perform this same task offline, where the entire visual index must reside on the mobile device itself within a small memory footprint. Such solutions have applications on location recognition and product recognition. Mobile instance retrieval requires a significant reduction in the visual index size. To achieve this, we describe a set of strategies that can reduce the visual index up to 60-80 compared to a scatannd raerddu iens tthaen vceis rueatrli ienvdaelx xim upple tom 6en0t-8at0io ×n found on ddte osk atops or servers. While our proposed reduction steps affect the overall mean Average Precision (mAP), they are able to maintain a good Precision for the top K results (PK). We argue that for such offline application, maintaining a good PK is sufficient. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on several standard databases. A working application designed for a remote historical site is also presented.

In this paper, for vocabulary tree based image retrieval, we propose a semantic-aware co-indexing algorithm to jointly San Antonio, TX 78249 . j dl@gmai l com qit ian@cs .ut sa . edu . The query embed two strong cues into the inverted indexes: 1) local invariant features that are robust to delineate low-level image contents, and 2) semantic attributes from large-scale object recognition that may reveal image semantic meanings. For an initial set of inverted indexes of local features, we utilize 1000 semantic attributes to filter out isolated images and insert semantically similar images to the initial set. Encoding these two distinct cues together effectively enhances the discriminative capability of inverted indexes. Such co-indexing operations are totally off-line and introduce small computation overhead to online query cause only local features but no semantic attributes are used for query. Experiments and comparisons with recent retrieval methods on 3 datasets, i.e., UKbench, Holidays, Oxford5K, and 1.3 million images from Flickr as distractors, manifest the competitive performance of our method 1.</p><p>6 0.10661311 <a title="419-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Query-Adaptive_Asymmetrical_Dissimilarities_for_Visual_Object_Retrieval.html">334 iccv-2013-Query-Adaptive Asymmetrical Dissimilarities for Visual Object Retrieval</a></p>

It encompasses the VLAD descriptor and matching techniques such as Hamming Embedding. Making the bridge between these approaches leads us to propose a match kernel that takes the best of existing techniques by combining an aggregation procedure with a selective match kernel. Finally, the representation underpinning this kernel is approximated, providing a large scale image search both precise and scalable, as shown by our experiments on several benchmarks.</p><p>2 0.81438762 <a title="419-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-Offline_Mobile_Instance_Retrieval_with_a_Small_Memory_Footprint.html">294 iccv-2013-Offline Mobile Instance Retrieval with a Small Memory Footprint</a></p>
<p>Author: Jayaguru Panda, Michael S. Brown, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: Existing mobile image instance retrieval applications assume a network-based usage where image features are sent to a server to query an online visual database. In this scenario, there are no restrictions on the size of the visual database. This paper, however, examines how to perform this same task offline, where the entire visual index must reside on the mobile device itself within a small memory footprint. Such solutions have applications on location recognition and product recognition. Mobile instance retrieval requires a significant reduction in the visual index size. To achieve this, we describe a set of strategies that can reduce the visual index up to 60-80 compared to a scatannd raerddu iens tthaen vceis rueatrli ienvdaelx xim upple tom 6en0t-8at0io ×n found on ddte osk atops or servers. While our proposed reduction steps affect the overall mean Average Precision (mAP), they are able to maintain a good Precision for the top K results (PK). We argue that for such offline application, maintaining a good PK is sufficient. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on several standard databases. A working application designed for a remote historical site is also presented. This application is able to reduce an 50,000 image index structure to 25 MBs while providing a precision of 97% for P10 and 100% for P1.</p><p>3 0.81260723 <a title="419-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Stable_Hyper-pooling_and_Query_Expansion_for_Event_Detection.html">400 iccv-2013-Stable Hyper-pooling and Query Expansion for Event Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Yan Xia, Kaiming He, Fang Wen, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: Inverted indexing is a popular non-exhaustive solution to large scale search. An inverted file is built by a quantizer such as k-means or a tree structure. It has been found that multiple inverted files, obtained by multiple independent random quantizers, are able to achieve practically good recall and speed. Instead of computing the multiple quantizers independently, we present a method that creates them jointly. Our method jointly optimizes all codewords in all quantizers. Then it assigns these codewords to the quantizers. In experiments this method shows significant improvement over various existing methods that use multiple independent quantizers. On the one-billion set of SIFT vectors, our method is faster and more accurate than a recent state-of-the-art inverted indexing method.</p><p>5 0.78428334 <a title="419-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Query-Adaptive_Asymmetrical_Dissimilarities_for_Visual_Object_Retrieval.html">334 iccv-2013-Query-Adaptive Asymmetrical Dissimilarities for Visual Object Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Cai-Zhi Zhu, Hervé Jégou, Shin'Ichi Satoh</p><p>Abstract: Visual object retrieval aims at retrieving, from a collection of images, all those in which a given query object appears. It is inherently asymmetric: the query object is mostly included in the database image, while the converse is not necessarily true. However, existing approaches mostly compare the images with symmetrical measures, without considering the different roles of query and database. This paper first measure the extent of asymmetry on large-scale public datasets reflecting this task. Considering the standard bag-of-words representation, we then propose new asymmetrical dissimilarities accounting for the different inlier ratios associated with query and database images. These asymmetrical measures depend on the query, yet they are compatible with an inverted file structure, without noticeably impacting search efficiency. Our experiments show the benefit of our approach, and show that the visual object retrieval task is better treated asymmetrically, in the spirit of state-of-the-art text retrieval.</p><p>6 0.77569187 <a title="419-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Quantize_and_Conquer%3A_A_Dimensionality-Recursive_Solution_to_Clustering%2C_Vector_Quantization%2C_and_Image_Retrieval.html">333 iccv-2013-Quantize and Conquer: A Dimensionality-Recursive Solution to Clustering, Vector Quantization, and Image Retrieval</a></p>

<p>Author: Yaser Yacoob</p><p>Abstract: When a translucent liquid is spilled over a rough surface it causes a significant change in the visual appearance of the surface. This wetting phenomenon is easily detected by humans, and an early model was devised by the physicist Andres Jonas Angstrom nearly a century ago. In this pa. umd . edu per we investigate the problem of determining if a wet/dry relationship between two image patches explains the differences in their visual appearance. Water tends to be the typical liquid involved and therefore it is the main objective. At the same time, we consider the general problem where the liquid has some of the characteristics of water (i.e., a similar refractive index), but has an unknown spectral absorption profile (e.g., coffee, tea, wine, etc.). We report on several experiments using our own images, a publicly available dataset, and images downloaded from the web. 1. Background When a material absorbs a liquid it changes visual appearance due to richer light reflection and refraction processes. Humans easily detect wet versus dry surfaces, and are capable of integrating this ability in object detection and segmentation. As a result, a wet part of a surface is associated with the dry part of the same surface despite significant differences in their appearance. For example, when driving over a partially wet road surface it is easily recognized as a drivable surface. Similarly, a wine spill on a couch is recognized as a stain and not a separate object. The same capability is harder to implement in computer vision since the basic attributes of edges, color distributions and texture are disrupted in the wetting process. Engineering algorithms around these changes has not received attention in published research. Nevertheless, such capability is needed to cope with partial wetting of surfaces. The emphasis ofthis paper is on surfaces combining both This work was partially supported by the Office of Naval Research under Grant N00014-10-1-0934. Figure1.Apartialywetconcret pavement,waterspiledon wood, water stain on a cap, and coffee spilled on a carpet. dry and wet parts. Distinguishing between completely wet and dry surfaces in independent images requires accounting for the illumination variations in the scenes, and may be subject to increased ambiguity in the absence of context. For example, comparing an image of a dry T-shirt to an image of the same T-shirt taken out of a washing machine is a more challenging problem since the straightforward solution is to consider them as different colored T-shirts. However, the algorithms we develop in this paper apply to this scenario assuming illumination is the same in both images. Figure 1 shows examples we analyze: (a) partially wet concrete pavement, (b) water spilled on a piece of wood, (c) water stain on a cap, and (d) coffee spilled on a carpet. We assume that the wet and dry patches have been pre-segmented and focus on whether the dry patch can be synthesized to appear wet under unknown parameters employing a well-known optical model. There are several factors that determine the visual appearance of wet versus dry surfaces. Specifically: • The physical properties of the liquid involved. The translucence (or light absorption) of the liquid determines ifinterreflection occurs and is visually observed. Water is translucent, while paint is near opaque. The light absorption of the liquid as a function of wave2952 lengths affects the overall spectral appearance of the wet area. Water absorbs slightly more of the green and red wavelengths and less of the blue wavelength, while olive oil absorbs more of the blue wavelength and much less of the red and green wavelengths. • • • The size and shape of the liquid affect the optical properties of the scene. For example, liquid droplets create a complex optical phenomenon as the curvature of each droplet acts as a lens (e.g., a drop of water can operate as a magnifying lens as well as cause light dispersion). The illuminant contributes to the appearance of both the dry and wet patches since it determines the wavelengths that are reaching the scene and the absorptions of the surface and liquid. The liquid absorption rate of the material determines whether a thin film of liquid remains floating apart on top of the material surface. For example, some plastics or highly polished metals absorb very little liquid and therefore a wetting phenomenon without absorption occurs. Nevertheless, non-absorbed liquids do change the appearance of the surface as they form droplets. • Specular reflections may occur at parts of the wet surface and therefore mask the light refraction from air-toliquid and interreflections that occur within the liquidmaterial complex. In this paper we study the problem of determining if two patches within the same image (or two images taken under similar illumination conditions) can be explained as wet and dry instances of the same material given that the material, liquid and illumination are unknown. The paper’s contribution is proposing an algorithm for searching a high-dimensional space of possible liquids, material and imaging parameters to determine a plausible wetting process that explains the appearance differences between two patches. Beyond the basic aspects of the problem, the results are relevant to fundamental capabilities such as detection, segmentation and recognition. 2. Related Research Wet surfaces were considered first as an optics albedo measurement of various surfaces by Angstrom in 1925 [1]. The proposed model assumed that light reaching the observer is solely stemming from rays at or exceeding the critical angle and thus the model suggested less light than experimental data. Lekner and Dorf [3] expanded this model by accounting for the probability of internal reflections in the water film and the effect of the decrease of the relative refractive index at the liquid to material surface. Ther model was shown to agree more closely with experimental data. In computer graphics, Jensen et al. [5] rendered wet surfaces by combining a reflection model for surface water with subsurface scattering. Gu et al [6] observed empirically the process of surface drying of several materials but no physical model for drying was offered. There has been little interest in wet surfaces in computer vision. Mall and da Vitoria Lobo [4] adopted the Lekner and Dorf model [3] to convert a dry material into a wet appearance and vice versa. The algorithm was described for greyscale images and fixed physical parameters. This work forms the basis of our paper. Teshima and Saito [2] developed a temporal approach for detection of wet road surfaces based on the occurrence of specular reflections across multiple images. 3. Approach Given two patches, Pd presumed dry, and Pw possibly wet, the objective is to determine if a liquid of unknown properties can synthesize the dry patch so that it appears visually similar to the wet patch. We employ the term material to describe the surface that absorbs the thin film of liquid to create the wet patch. We leverage the optical model developed by [3] and used by [4], by formulating a search over the parameter space of possible materials and liquids. In this paper we focus on a partial set of liquid on ma- terial appearances. Specifically, we exclude specular reflections, non-absorbing materials, and liquid droplets. 3.1. Optics Model Figure 2 shows the basic model developed in [3]. A light ray entering the liquid film over the rough material surface with a probability of 1−Rl where Rl is the reflectance at the air-liquid interface. A fraction, a, ofthis light is absorbed by the material surface, and thus (1 Rl) ∗ (1 a) is reflected back to the liquid surface. Let p be the fraction of light reflected back into the liquid at the liquid-air surface. The total probability of absorption by the rough surface as this process repeats is described by − − A=(1−Rl)[a+a(1−a)p+a(1−a)2p2+...]=1(−1p−(R1−l)aa) .(1) Lekner and Dorf [3] show that p can be written in terms of the liquid ’s refractive index nl and the average isotropically illuminated surface R: p = 1 −n1l2[1 − R(nl)] where (2) R(n) (n > 1): R(n) = 3n32(n++2n1)+21 −(2nn23+(n12)+2(n2n2−−11)) + n(2n(2n−2+1)21)log(n) −n2(n(2n2+−1)13)2log(nn(n−+11)) (3) 2953 Figure2.Thligta1−rR-ltoiqu(d1−Ral()1n−adliqu1(−-Rlt1()o−-asp)urfcemodl. Lekner and Dorff [3] proposed that the light absorption rates of the dry and wet materials are different, and that the wet material will always have a higher absorption rate. Let ad and aw be the light absorption rates of the dry and wet materials respectively, so that aw > ad. Thus the albedo values for the dry and wet surfaces are 1−ad and A = 1 aw, respectively, assuming isotropic illumination. Let nr be the refractive index of the material. For small absorptions, ad ≈ 1 and aw ≈ 1 and therefore − R(nr), aw ≈ − R(nr/nl) ad[1 − R(nr/nl)]/[1 − R(nr)] while for large absorptions aw ≈ the two values can be expressed as ad. An interpolation of aw= ad(1 − ad)11 − − R R(n(rn/rn)l)+ ad 3.2. Imaging Model (4) (5) Lekner and Dorff [3] and Mall and da Vitoria Lobo [4] focused on the albedo change between dry and wet surfaces. The model is suitable for estimating reflectance of a single wavelength but requires extension to aggregated wavelengths captured by greyscale or color images. In [4], the model was applied to greyscale images where the true albedo was approximated by using the maximum observed brightness in the patch. This assumes that micro-facet orientations of the material are widely distributed. Color images present two additional issues: cameras (1) integrate light across spectral zones, and (2) apply image processing, enhancement and compression to the raw images. As a result, the input image is a function of the actual physical process but may not be quantitatively accurate. Our objective is to estimate the albedo of the homogeneous dry patch, Pd, for each of the RGB channels (overlooking the real spectral wavelengths), despite unknown imaging parameters. It is critical to note that the camera acquires an image that is a function of the albedo, surface normal and illuminant attributes (direction, intensity and emitted wavelengths) at each pixel, so that estimating the true physical albedo is challenging in the absence of information about the scene. In the following we first describe a representation of the relative albedo in RGB and then describe how it is re-formulated to derive possible absolute albedo values. Let the albedo of the homogeneous dry material be AR, AG , AB with respect to the RGB channels. Then, AR = 1 − aR, AG = 1 − aG, AB = 1 − aB (6) where aR, aG , aB are the absorption rates of light in the red, green and blue channels, respectively. Since the value of each absorption parameter is between 0 and 1, it is possible to search this three dimensional space in small increments of aR, aG , aB values. However, these absorption rates are confounded with the variable surface normals across the patch as we consider RGB values. Instead, we observe that the colors of pixels reflect, approximately, the relative absorption rates of red, green and blue. For example, a grey pixel indicates equal absorption in red, green and blue regardless of the level of the greyness. The surface normal contributes to a scalar that modifies the amount of light captured by the camera, but does not alter the relative albedos. Therefore, we can parametrize the albedo values as AR ∗ (1, rGR, rBR), where rGR and rBR are the relative albedo values green-to-red and blue-to-red, respectively. This parametrization does not, theoretically, change due to variation in surface normals. Specifically, consider a homogeneous patch of constant albedo but variable surface normals, and assuming a Lambertian model, the image reflectance can be expressed as IR(x, y) = AR IG (x, y) = AG IB (x, y) = AB ∗ ∗ ∗ (N(x, y) · S(x, y)) (N(x, y) · S(x, y)) (N(x, y) · S(x, y)) (7) where N(x, y) and S(x, y) are the surface normal and the illuminant direction at (x, y), respectively (S(x, y) = S for a distant point light source). The two ratios rGR = IG/IR and rBR = IB/IR are constant for all pixels (x, y) independent of the dot product of the normal and illumination vectors (N(x, y) · S(x, y)) (since they cancel out). In practice, however, due to imaging artifacts, the ratios are more defuse and therefore multiple ratios may be detectable over a patch. Given a dry patch, Pd, we compute a set of (rGR, rBR) pairs. If the patch were perfectly uniform (in terms of surface normals), a single pair will be found, but for complex surfaces there may be several such pairs. We histogram the normalized G/R and B/R values to compute these pairs. Let Sd denote the set of these ratios computed over Pd. As a result of the above parametrization, the red albedo, AR, is unknown and it will be searched for optimal fit and AG and AB are computed from the Sd ratios. Mall and da Vitoria Lobo [4] proposed that assuming a rough surface, the maximum reflected brightness, Imax, can be used as a denominator to normalize all values and generate relative albedo values. In reality, even under these assumptions, Imax is the lower-bound value that should be 2954 used as denominator to infer the albedo of the patch. Moreover, the values acquired by the camera are subject to automatic gain, white balance and other processing that tend to change numerical values. For example, a surface with albedo equal to 1, may have a value of 180 (out of 256 levels), and therefore mislead the recovery of the true surface albedo (i.e., suggesting a lower albedo than 1). The optics framework requires absolute albedo values to predict the wet albedo of the surface. Therefore, the reflectance values should be normalized with respect to an unknown Rwhite ≥ Imax (typically) which represents the absolute value that corresponds to the intensity of a fully reflective surface under the same imaging conditions (including unknown camera imaging parameters, and a normal and illuminant dot product equal to 1.0). Note that for an ideal image acquisition an albedo of 1 corresponds to Rwhite = 256, but in practice Rwhite can be lower (e.g., for white balance) or higher than 256 (e.g., camera gain). Determining Rwhite involves a search for the best value in the range Imax to IUpperBound. While IUpperBound can be chosen as a large number, the computational cost is prohibitive. Instead, we observe that if we assume that the patch includes all possible surface normal orientations, then the maximum intensity, Imax corresponds to (N(x, y) · S(x, y)) being 1.0 while minimum intensity Imin corresponds to (N(x, y) · S(x, y)) near zero, for the unknown albedo A (see Equation 7). Let denote a vector of the values of all the normals multiplied by the illuminant direction (these values span the range 0..1). Therefore, the brightness of an object with an albedo of 1in these unknown imaging conditions (and including the camera’s image processing) can be computed as n IUpperBound = 256 ∗ max(A ∗ n) + 256 ∗ max ((1 − A) ∗ n) (8) where 256 is the camera’s intensity output range (assuming no saturation occurred). This is equal to IUpperBound = Imax + (256 − Imin) (9) Imax and Imin may be subject to noise and imaging factors that may create outliers, so we approximate the intensity values as a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation σ and assign Imax Imin = 4 ∗ σ cropping the tail values and capturing near 97% of the distribution, so that IUpperBound = 256 + 4 ∗ σ. This gaussian assumption is reasonable for a rough surface but for a flat surface, σ is near zero, and therefore we use IUpperBound = 256 + 100 as an arbitrary value. Note that IUpperBound reduces the range of the search for the best Rwhite and not the quality of the results. We use the largest value of IUpperBound computed for each of the RGB channels for all searches. Imax may be subject to automatic gain amplification during acquisition. Therefore, the range of values for Rwhite is expanded to be from 0.75 ∗ Imax to IUpperBound. The choice of 0.75 is arbitrary since it assumes that the gain is limited to 33% of the true values, and one could choose a different values. Given a pixel from a dry patch, Pd, we can convert its value to a wet pixel − Pw (x, y) = Pd(x, y) + ((1 − ad) − (1− aw)) ∗ Rwhite (10) where aw is calculated using Equation 5 given a specific ad. Equation 10 is applied to each of the RGB channels using the respective parameters. 3.3. Liquid Spectral Absorption The model described so far assumed that the spectral absorption of the liquid film itself is near zero across all wavelengths. This is a reasonable assumption for water since it can be treated as translucent given the negligible thickness of the liquid present at the surface. We next consider water-based liquids that have different absorption rates across wavelengths such as coffee and wine (even at negligible thickness). We assume a refractive index that is equal to water, however we assume that qr , qg , qb represent corrective absorption rates in RGB, respectively. These corrective rates modify the darkening due to water-based wetness. The real liquid absorption rates are computed as Lr = qr Lg = awg Lb = awb − awr − awr + qg + (11) qb where awr, awg, awb are the respective wet surface absorptions for red, green and blue, respectively (for water). Equation 10 is modified to account for the liquid absorption rates: Pw (x ,y) = Pd (x ,y) + (( 1 − ad ) − (1 − aw ) − ( 1 q) ) ∗ − Rw hite (12) where the respective parameters for each of the RGB channels are used. Note that Equation 11 computes relative ab- sorption rates with respect to qr, so that we recover only the differences in absorptions between the RGB channels. Nevertheless, these relative absorptions are informative and sufficient since the absolute values are intertwined with the intensity of the illuminant. For example, adding a constant absorption of 0.1 to each of Lr, Lg , Lb is equal to decrease in reflected light equal to a 10% loss of illuminant intensity. Absent prior information, we search the full range of possible values between 0 1.0 for each variable. In practice, we can, in most cases, limit the search to values between 0.0 0.5 since higher values are likely, when combined with the increased absorption due to wetting, to drive total light absorption to 1.0 which represents a black object. In cases where the Pw shows complete absorption of a wavelength (e.g., a thick layer of wine or coffee), the 0..1 range is searched. Moreover, values that represent equal absorptions, qr ≈ qg ≈ qb are unnecessary to consider since − − 2955 they are functionally equivalent to water (but they do contribute uniform darkening in all channels that is automatically captured in the computation of the absorption values of the material). The search is conducted in small increments of 0.02. 3.4. Similarity Metric The synthesized wet patch Ps is scored against Pw. A useful similarity metric is the well-known Earth Mover’s Distance [7] (EMD). The distance is computed between the size-normalized histograms of the two patches. The smaller the distance, the closer the appearance between the synthesized and true wet patches. Given that these patches are typically taken from different parts of the same image, we assume that the dry and wet patches are of the same material as well as have similar surface normal distributions. If the distributions of surface normals between the two patches violate this assumption, we have a suboptimal similarity metric. Devising a metric that accounts for different and unknown distributions of surface normal remains an open problem. Note that EMD is not suitable for comparing different materials (e.g., if the wet and dry material are of two different wood species). 4. Search Space We summarize the search parameters to determine the best synthesis, Ps, of Pd given Pw. The refractive index of the material, nr is unknown. Refractive indices of materials vary widely, with air being near 1.0 and the highest measured material (a synthetic material) is 38.6. Common materials, however, tend to fall between 1−5.0. As a result, we perform a search on all values of nr between 1.1 − 5.0 in increments of 0.1 (note that if we assume the material to have higher refractive index than water, the search can be made between 1.5 −5.0). Note that nr is dependent on light wavelengths (i.e., light wavelengths have slightly different speeds in the same medium), but accounting for this variation in the search process is computationally expensive. Therefore, we use the same nr for the three channels. We assume the liquid to be water-like, so that nl is known. Specifically, we assume that nl = 1.331 for the red channel, nl = 1.336 for the green channel, and nl = 1.343 for the blue channel. This assumption is suitable for most water-based liquids such as coffee, wine, etc. (in practice, the ethanol in wine increases the refractive index slightly, and coffee particles increase it upto 1.5). Other liquids, such as oil, have different refractive indices, but since we assume no prior information, we employ the water refractive indices even when oil may be involved. The absorption rate of the dry material, ad, is unknown and falls in the range 0 − 1.0. The discussion in subsection 3.2 uses the albedo AR as a variable and derives the green and blue albedo values, and thus their absorptions accordingly. Therefore, we perform a search over all values between 0.05 − 0.95 in 0.05 increments for adR . The values Imin, Imax and IUpperBound are pre-computed and then a search for optimal Rwhite is computed in increments of 20 units for the range 0.75 ∗ Imax and IUpperBound. Depending on the expected liquid, we can limit the search to water, or search in a reduced 3D space of liquid correction absorption rates, qr, qg , qb, as discussed in section 3.3. Algorithm 1, below, is for the case of water, but can be adjusted for an unknown liquid.

Experiments We conducted experiments on three data sets: collected by us, collected from the web, and a controlled set of drying objects collected and described in Gu et al. [6]. The experiments answer the question: given a dry patch, Pd and a patch likely to be wet Pw, what are the best parameters that make Pd look most similar to Pw? The answer allows uncovering physical information about the liquid and the material which is valuable for computer vision. The answer may also indicate that no wetting process can make Pd look like Pw, which is also valuable since it suggests that the two patches differ in more significant ways. Note that we focus on applying a physically-motivated model to the problem and not an image-based appearance transformation. One could pose the problem differently by computing a transformation (that has nothing to do with wetting) that maximizes the similarity between a transformed Pd and Pw. But such transformation does not uncover information about the physical process that is involved and is ultimately less insightful. The patches Pd and Pw are manually delineated. The border area between the patches is neither fully dry or wet. Therefore, the border area is rarely synthesized properly. We exclude these boundary pixels from EMD computation between Ps and Pw . 2956 Empirically, we observed that EMD distances below 20 indicate close resemblance and below 10 are near identical images. Note that EMD does not capture the spatial color variations (i.e., texture differences). In all figures below, the numeric values show the EMD distance, followed by (nr, Rwhite), the next row shows the respective albedo values AR, AG, AB. In the images of the colored liquids, the third row shows the albedo of the liquid ALR, ALG, ALB . Figure 3 shows the results of the closest synthetic wetting of a dry material (images taken from [6]). These images were taken under controlled illumination but at different times, as the initially wet material dried. The top row shows the dry materials, the middle row shows the real wet material, both are provided by [6]. The bottom row of images shows the computed wet materials using our algorithm. Below each image we provide the physical parameters that our algorithm uncovered, assuming the liquid is water. Note that most of the true wet images have some specular reflections that are not generated by our model. The materials are (left to right), rock, wood, cloth, wood, felt, paper, cardboard, brick, wood, cloth, cloth and granite. The results indicate that wood is the least successfully analyzed material. The wet wood has increased spectral divergence in colors beyond what the dry material exhibits and therefore does not appear to be correctly captured by the model. Specifically, the wet wood appears to absorb more of the blue and green light relative to red, and therefore the wood is tinted brown-red. We discuss this issue further in Section 6. Figure 4 shows images we acquired of different wet materials. From left to right all images have a darker wet patch: yellow paper (wet on the right side), paper towel, large area of a cap, a smaller part of the same cap, blue paper, orange fleece material, grey/blue paper, green paper, orange fabric, and grey/blue fabric. The distances are largest for the complete green cap and blue paper. The reason is that the surface normal distributions vary between the wet and dry patches, and therefore the EMD is not a suitable metric (see discussion in subsection 3.4). The smaller part of the cap shows very good synthesis of the dry patch. Figure 5 shows a collection of images of water-based wetting of different materials downloaded from the web. From left to right, raster scan, partially wet: two cardboard images, concrete, yellow brick, three types of wood, blue fabric, two images of different types of sand, red tile, red brick, blue/green brick, striped shirt and grey pants. Two of the wood images show the largest distances and a discussion of likely reasons is provided in Section 6. The rest of images are close to the real wet areas in each image ignoring the borders between patches. Figure 5 shows a collection of images downloaded from the web ofnon-water wetting. From left to right, raster scan, partially wet: coffee on carpet, coffee on wood, wine on carpet, olive oil on humus, olive oil on wood, tea on fabric, coffee on fabric, two images of coffee on carpet, wine on tile, wine on carpet, wine on granite, same image but applying a water model, wine on carpet, coffee on plastic table cloth, coffee on carpet, coffee on shirt, same image but applying a water model, wine on yellow napkin, and soy sauce on yellow napkin (the last two images are acquired by us). The liquid color is rendered with intensity that is close to the wet area. The wine on granite and coffee on shirt are used to also demonstrate the results of the water model as opposed to accounting for different spectral absorptions. Overall the distances are low with exception to the olive oil on wood and wine on white carpet (middle of the bottom group). The olive oil on wood maybe related to explanations in Section 6 while the wine on carpet shows marked difference in surface normals between the dry and wet patches (the wet patches are in focus while the dry patch is blurred). 6. Open Challenges The experiments indicated that in some images of wet wood, the model is not accurate. Figure 7 shows an image of an outdoor deck, a part of a wetted area used for an experiment, and the synthesized dry patch using our model. The dry wood appears nearly perfectly grey, while the wet wood is brown. The wet pixels show high absorption of green relative to red, and even higher absorption of blue relative to green and red. The model does not predict this result given that the liquid is water. A similar phenomenon was observed in some experiments in Figures 3 and 5. We suggest two conjectures as to why this occurs. The first has to do with image acquisition, and suggests that perhaps the camera is overstating the amount of blue and green light reflected at the dry patch. The second is that these woods and their resultant images have a more complex wetting process. Specifically, it is possible that this wood is composed of 2 layers, the first is very thin and tends to have only a hint of the spectral properties of the wood, and the second layer reflects the full spectral attributes of the wood. The top layer may come to exist due to environmental degradation or dust, but may not exist in freshly cut wood. For the dry wood in Figure 7 the reflectance is mostly the result of reflection from the top layer, while upon wetting, the second layer is reached by the water and thus it be- the dominant source of reflectance. Unfortunately it remains an open challenge to explain these deviations from the model. Differences in the distributions of the surface normals between the dry and wet patches make it harder to determine similarity (even if a different metric than EMD is used). This is general computer vision problem that is not specific to wetting, but is made more challenging by the complexity of the wetting process. comes 2957 8.3 (2.8,195) (0.90,0.89,0.87) 8.8(5.0,182) (0.05,0.03,0.02) 20.2 (2.1,155) 25.0(1.8,160) 6.4 (0.30,0.20,0.15) (0.10,0.08,0.07) (5.0,233) (0.05,0.05,0.05) 16.4 (5.0,162) (0.60,0.61,0.62) 9.2(5.0,247) 3.0(5.0,154) 24. 1(5.0,146) (0.15,0.14,0.12) (0.10,0.09,0.09) (0.10,0.09,0.08) 1.5 (4.8,121) (0.25,0.27,0.21) 13.3(2.7,131) 7.0(3.8,157) (0.15,0. 15,0.15) (0.30,0.29,0.28) Figure 3.

Summary In this paper we investigated the problem of visual appearance change as liquids and rough surfaces interact. The problem assumes that two patches, the first is known to be dry and the second is possibly wet are given. Liquid attributes that are close to water, but also allow for varying absorption rates across spectral wavelengths allow accounting for unknown liquids suchs as coffee, wine and oil. Our experiments indicate an ability to explain wetting effects in different materials and under unknown imaging conditions. References [1] A. Angstrom.

<p>Author: Che-Han Chang, Min-Chun Hu, Wen-Huang Cheng, Yung-Yu Chuang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new projection model for mapping a hemisphere to a plane. Such a model can be useful for viewing wide-angle images. Our model consists of two steps. In the first step, the hemisphere is projected onto a swung surface constructed by a circular profile and a rounded rectangular trajectory. The second step maps the projected image on the swung surface onto the image plane through the perspective projection. We also propose a method for automatically determining proper parameters for the projection model based on image content. The proposed model has several advantages. It is simple, efficient and easy to control. Most importantly, it makes a better compromise between distortion minimization and line preserving than popular projection models, such as stereographic and Pannini projections. Experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.80825406 <a title="419-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-To_Aggregate_or_Not_to_aggregate%3A_Selective_Match_Kernels_for_Image_Search.html">419 iccv-2013-To Aggregate or Not to aggregate: Selective Match Kernels for Image Search</a></p>

<p>Author: Liang-Chieh Chen, George Papandreou, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: The first main contribution of this paper is a novel method for representing images based on a dictionary of shape epitomes. These shape epitomes represent the local edge structure of the image and include hidden variables to encode shift and rotations. They are learnt in an unsupervised manner from groundtruth edges. This dictionary is compact but is also able to capture the typical shapes of edges in natural images. In this paper, we illustrate the shape epitomes by applying them to the image labeling task. In other work, described in the supplementary material, we apply them to edge detection and image modeling. We apply shape epitomes to image labeling by using Conditional Random Field (CRF) Models. They are alternatives to the superpixel or pixel representations used in most CRFs. In our approach, the shape of an image patch is encoded by a shape epitome from the dictionary. Unlike the superpixel representation, our method avoids making early decisions which cannot be reversed. Our resulting hierarchical CRFs efficiently capture both local and global class co-occurrence properties. We demonstrate its quanti- tative and qualitativeproperties ofour approach with image labeling experiments on two standard datasets: MSRC-21 and Stanford Background.</p><p>5 0.71551931 <a title="419-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Pose_Estimation_and_Segmentation_of_People_in_3D_Movies.html">322 iccv-2013-Pose Estimation and Segmentation of People in 3D Movies</a></p>

The contributions of our work are two-fold: First, we develop a segmentation model incorporating person detection, pose estimation, as well as colour, motion, and disparity cues. Our new model explicitly represents depth ordering and occlusion. Second, we introduce a stereoscopic dataset with frames extracted from feature-length movies “StreetDance 3D ” and “Pina ”. The dataset contains 2727 realistic stereo pairs and includes annotation of human poses, person bounding boxes, and pixel-wise segmentations for hundreds of people. The dataset is composed of indoor and outdoor scenes depicting multiple people with frequent occlusions.

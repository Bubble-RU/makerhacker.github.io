<p>Author: Alon Faktor, Michal Irani</p><p>Abstract: Given a set of images which share an object from the same semantic category, we would like to co-segment the shared object. We define ‘good’ co-segments to be ones which can be easily composed (like a puzzle) from large pieces of other co-segments, yet are difficult to compose from remaining image parts. These pieces must not only match well but also be statistically significant (hard to compose at random). This gives rise to co-segmentation of objects in very challenging scenarios with large variations in appearance, shape and large amounts of clutter. We further show how multiple images can collaborate and “score each others ’ co-segments to improve the overall fidelity and accuracy of the co-segmentation. Our co-segmentation can be applied both to large image collections, as well as to very few images (where there is too little data for unsupervised learning). At the extreme, it can be applied even to a single image, to extract its co-occurring objects. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. We further show very encouraging co-segmentation results on the challenging PASCAL-VOC dataset. ”</p><p>3 0.19055028 <a title="208-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Segmentation_by_Tracking_Many_Figure-Ground_Segments.html">442 iccv-2013-Video Segmentation by Tracking Many Figure-Ground Segments</a></p>
<p>Author: Fuxin Li, Taeyoung Kim, Ahmad Humayun, David Tsai, James M. Rehg</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised video segmentation approach by simultaneously tracking multiple holistic figureground segments. Segment tracks are initialized from a pool of segment proposals generated from a figure-ground segmentation algorithm. Then, online non-local appearance models are trained incrementally for each track using a multi-output regularized least squares formulation. By using the same set of training examples for all segment tracks, a computational trick allows us to track hundreds of segment tracks efficiently, as well as perform optimal online updates in closed-form. Besides, a new composite statistical inference approach is proposed for refining the obtained segment tracks, which breaks down the initial segment proposals and recombines for better ones by utilizing highorder statistic estimates from the appearance model and enforcing temporal consistency. For evaluating the algorithm, a dataset, SegTrack v2, is collected with about 1,000 frames with pixel-level annotations. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in the dataset, show- ing its efficiency and robustness to challenges in different video sequences.</p><p>4 0.18859592 <a title="208-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Semi-supervised_Learning_for_Large_Scale_Image_Cosegmentation.html">383 iccv-2013-Semi-supervised Learning for Large Scale Image Cosegmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengxiang Wang, Rujie Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces to use semi-supervised learning for large scale image cosegmentation. Different from traditional unsupervised cosegmentation that does not use any segmentation groundtruth, semi-supervised cosegmentation exploits the similarity from both the very limited training image foregrounds, as well as the common object shared between the large number of unsegmented images. This would be a much practical way to effectively cosegment a large number of related images simultaneously, where previous unsupervised cosegmentation work poorly due to the large variances in appearance between different images and the lack ofsegmentation groundtruthfor guidance in cosegmentation. For semi-supervised cosegmentation in large scale, we propose an effective method by minimizing an energy function, which consists of the inter-image distance, the intraimage distance and the balance term. We also propose an iterative updating algorithm to efficiently solve this energy function, which decomposes the original energy minimization problem into sub-problems, and updates each image alternatively to reduce the number of variables in each subproblem for computation efficiency. Experiment results on iCoseg and Pascal VOC datasets show that the proposed cosegmentation method can effectively cosegment hundreds of images in less than one minute. And our semi-supervised cosegmentation is able to outperform both unsupervised cosegmentation as well asfully supervised single image segmentation, especially when the training data is limited.</p><p>5 0.18800381 <a title="208-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic_Segmentation_without_Annotating_Segments.html">379 iccv-2013-Semantic Segmentation without Annotating Segments</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Xia, Csaba Domokos, Jian Dong, Loong-Fah Cheong, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: Numerous existing object segmentation frameworks commonly utilize the object bounding box as a prior. In this paper, we address semantic segmentation assuming that object bounding boxes are provided by object detectors, but no training data with annotated segments are available. Based on a set of segment hypotheses, we introduce a simple voting scheme to estimate shape guidance for each bounding box. The derived shape guidance is used in the subsequent graph-cut-based figure-ground segmentation. The final segmentation result is obtained by merging the segmentation results in the bounding boxes. We conduct an extensive analysis of the effect of object bounding box accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on both the challenging PASCAL VOC object segmentation dataset and GrabCut50 image segmentation dataset show that the proposed approach achieves competitive results compared to previous detection or bounding box prior based methods, as well as other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods.</p><p>6 0.17649737 <a title="208-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Image_Partitioning_Using_Decision_Trees_with_Structured_Split_Criteria.html">448 iccv-2013-Weakly Supervised Learning of Image Partitioning Using Decision Trees with Structured Split Criteria</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel M. Steinberg, Oscar Pizarro, Stefan B. Williams</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of cheap, high fidelity, digital imaging systems, the quantity and rate of generation of visual data can dramatically outpace a humans ability to label or annotate it. In these situations there is scope for the use of unsupervised approaches that can model these datasets and automatically summarise their content. To this end, we present a totally unsupervised, and annotation-less, model for scene understanding. This model can simultaneously cluster whole-image and segment descriptors, therebyforming an unsupervised model of scenes and objects. We show that this model outperforms other unsupervised models that can only cluster one source of information (image or segment) at once. We are able to compare unsupervised and supervised techniques using standard measures derived from confusion matrices and contingency tables. This shows that our unsupervised model is competitive with current supervised and weakly-supervised models for scene understanding on standard datasets. We also demonstrate our model operating on a dataset with more than 100,000 images col- lected by an autonomous underwater vehicle.</p><p>5 0.79119462 <a title="208-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-GrabCut_in_One_Cut.html">186 iccv-2013-GrabCut in One Cut</a></p>
<p>Author: Meng Tang, Lena Gorelick, Olga Veksler, Yuri Boykov</p><p>Abstract: Among image segmentation algorithms there are two major groups: (a) methods assuming known appearance models and (b) methods estimating appearance models jointly with segmentation. Typically, the first group optimizes appearance log-likelihoods in combination with some spacial regularization. This problem is relatively simple and many methods guarantee globally optimal results. The second group treats model parameters as additional variables transforming simple segmentation energies into highorder NP-hard functionals (Zhu-Yuille, Chan-Vese, GrabCut, etc). It is known that such methods indirectly minimize the appearance overlap between the segments. We propose a new energy term explicitly measuring L1 distance between the object and background appearance models that can be globally maximized in one graph cut. We show that in many applications our simple term makes NP-hard segmentation functionals unnecessary. Our one cut algorithm effectively replaces approximate iterative optimization techniques based on block coordinate descent.</p><p>6 0.75986558 <a title="208-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Semi-supervised_Learning_for_Large_Scale_Image_Cosegmentation.html">383 iccv-2013-Semi-supervised Learning for Large Scale Image Cosegmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jan Lellmann, Evgeny Strekalovskiy, Sabrina Koetter, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: While total variation is among the most popular regularizers for variational problems, its extension to functions with values in a manifold is an open problem. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to solve such problems which applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. The key idea is to reformulate the variational problem as a multilabel optimization problem with an infinite number of labels. This leads to a hard optimization problem which can be approximately solved using convex relaxation techniques. The framework can be easily adapted to different manifolds including spheres and three-dimensional rotations, and allows to obtain accurate solutions even with a relatively coarse discretization. With numerous examples we demonstrate that the proposed framework can be applied to variational models that incorporate chromaticity values, normal fields, or camera trajectories.</p><p>2 0.78321034 <a title="208-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Network_Principles_for_SfM%3A_Disambiguating_Repeated_Structures_with_Local_Context.html">289 iccv-2013-Network Principles for SfM: Disambiguating Repeated Structures with Local Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Kyle Wilson, Noah Snavely</p><p>Abstract: Repeated features are common in urban scenes. Many objects, such as clock towers with nearly identical sides, or domes with strong radial symmetries, pose challenges for structure from motion. When similar but distinct features are mistakenly equated, the resulting 3D reconstructions can have errors ranging from phantom walls and superimposed structures to a complete failure to reconstruct. We present a new approach to solving such problems by considering the local visibility structure of such repeated features. Drawing upon network theory, we present a new way of scoring features using a measure of local clustering. Our model leads to a simple, fast, and highly scalable technique for disambiguating repeated features based on an analysis of an underlying visibility graph, without relying on explicit geometric reasoning. We demonstrate our method on several very large datasets drawn from Internet photo collections, and compare it to a more traditional geometry-based disambiguation technique.</p><p>3 0.75953573 <a title="208-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Similarity_Metric_Learning_for_Face_Recognition.html">392 iccv-2013-Similarity Metric Learning for Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiong Cao, Yiming Ying, Peng Li</p><p>Abstract: Recently, there is a considerable amount of efforts devoted to the problem of unconstrained face verification, where the task is to predict whether pairs of images are from the same person or not. This problem is challenging and difficult due to the large variations in face images. In this paper, we develop a novel regularization framework to learn similarity metrics for unconstrained face verification. We formulate its objective function by incorporating the robustness to the large intra-personal variations and the discriminative power of novel similarity metrics. In addition, our formulation is a convex optimization problem which guarantees the existence of its global solution. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on the challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) database [10].</p><p>4 0.73500794 <a title="208-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-EVSAC%3A_Accelerating_Hypotheses_Generation_by_Modeling_Matching_Scores_with_Extreme_Value_Theory.html">131 iccv-2013-EVSAC: Accelerating Hypotheses Generation by Modeling Matching Scores with Extreme Value Theory</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Fragoso, Pradeep Sen, Sergio Rodriguez, Matthew Turk</p><p>Abstract: Algorithms based on RANSAC that estimate models usingfeature correspondences between images can slow down tremendously when the percentage of correct correspondences (inliers) is small. In this paper, we present a probabilistic parametric model that allows us to assign confidence values for each matching correspondence and therefore accelerates the generation of hypothesis models for RANSAC under these conditions. Our framework leverages Extreme Value Theory to accurately model the statistics of matching scores produced by a nearest-neighbor feature matcher. Using a new algorithm based on this model, we are able to estimate accurate hypotheses with RANSAC at low inlier ratios significantly faster than previous stateof-the-art approaches, while still performing comparably when the number ofinliers is large. Wepresent results ofhomography and fundamental matrix estimation experiments for both SIFT and SURF matches that demonstrate that our method leads to accurate and fast model estimations.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.71874279 <a title="208-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Co-segmentation_via_Consistent_Functional_Maps.html">208 iccv-2013-Image Co-segmentation via Consistent Functional Maps</a></p>
<p>Author: Fan Wang, Qixing Huang, Leonidas J. Guibas</p><p>Abstract: Joint segmentation of image sets has great importance for object recognition, image classification, and image retrieval. In this paper, we aim to jointly segment a set of images starting from a small number of labeled images or none at all. To allow the images to share segmentation information with each other, we build a network that contains segmented as well as unsegmented images, and extract functional maps between connected image pairs based on image appearance features. These functional maps act as general property transporters between the images and, in particular, are used to transfer segmentations. We define and operate in a reduced functional space optimized so that the functional maps approximately satisfy cycle-consistency under composition in the network. A joint optimization framework is proposed to simultaneously generate all segmentation functions over the images so that they both align with local segmentation cues in each particular image, and agree with each other under network transportation. This formulation allows us to extract segmentations even with no training data, but can also exploit such data when available. The collective effect of the joint processing using functional maps leads to accurate information sharing among images and yields superior segmentation results, as shown on the iCoseg, MSRC, and PASCAL data sets.</p><p>6 0.70267147 <a title="208-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Domain_Adaptive_Classification.html">123 iccv-2013-Domain Adaptive Classification</a></p>

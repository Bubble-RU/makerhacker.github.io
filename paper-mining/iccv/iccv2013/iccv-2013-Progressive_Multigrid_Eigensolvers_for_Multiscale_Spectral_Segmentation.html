<p>Author: Kwang In Kim, James Tompkin, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: One fundamental assumption in object recognition as well as in other computer vision and pattern recognition problems is that the data generation process lies on a manifold and that it respects the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. This assumption is held in several successful algorithms for diffusion and regularization, in particular, in graph-Laplacian-based algorithms. We claim that the performance of existing algorithms can be improved if we additionally account for how the manifold is embedded within the ambient space, i.e., if we consider the extrinsic geometry of the manifold. We present a procedure for characterizing the extrinsic (as well as intrinsic) curvature of a manifold M which is described by a sampled point cloud in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Once estimated, we use this characterization in general diffusion and regularization on M, and form a new regularizer on a point cloud. The resulting re-weighted graph Laplacian demonstrates superior performance over classical graph Laplacian in semisupervised learning and spectral clustering.</p><p>3 0.07305105 <a title="329-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Volumetric_Semantic_Segmentation_Using_Pyramid_Context_Features.html">447 iccv-2013-Volumetric Semantic Segmentation Using Pyramid Context Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan T. Barron, Mark D. Biggin, Pablo Arbeláez, David W. Knowles, Soile V.E. Keranen, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm for the per-voxel semantic segmentation of a three-dimensional volume. At the core of our algorithm is a novel “pyramid context” feature, a descriptive representation designed such that exact per-voxel linear classification can be made extremely efficient. This feature not only allows for efficient semantic segmentation but enables other aspects of our algorithm, such as novel learned features and a stacked architecture that can reason about self-consistency. We demonstrate our technique on 3Dfluorescence microscopy data ofDrosophila embryosfor which we are able to produce extremely accurate semantic segmentations in a matter of minutes, and for which other algorithms fail due to the size and high-dimensionality of the data, or due to the difficulty of the task.</p><p>4 0.068378672 <a title="329-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Co-segmentation_via_Consistent_Functional_Maps.html">208 iccv-2013-Image Co-segmentation via Consistent Functional Maps</a></p>
<p>Author: Fan Wang, Qixing Huang, Leonidas J. Guibas</p><p>Abstract: Joint segmentation of image sets has great importance for object recognition, image classification, and image retrieval. In this paper, we aim to jointly segment a set of images starting from a small number of labeled images or none at all. To allow the images to share segmentation information with each other, we build a network that contains segmented as well as unsegmented images, and extract functional maps between connected image pairs based on image appearance features. These functional maps act as general property transporters between the images and, in particular, are used to transfer segmentations. We define and operate in a reduced functional space optimized so that the functional maps approximately satisfy cycle-consistency under composition in the network. A joint optimization framework is proposed to simultaneously generate all segmentation functions over the images so that they both align with local segmentation cues in each particular image, and agree with each other under network transportation. This formulation allows us to extract segmentations even with no training data, but can also exploit such data when available. The collective effect of the joint processing using functional maps leads to accurate information sharing among images and yields superior segmentation results, as shown on the iCoseg, MSRC, and PASCAL data sets.</p><p>5 0.062415153 <a title="329-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Motion_Segmentation_Using_Dynamic_Label_Propagation.html">297 iccv-2013-Online Motion Segmentation Using Dynamic Label Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Elqursh, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: The vast majority of work on motion segmentation adopts the affine camera model due to its simplicity. Under the affine model, the motion segmentation problem becomes that of subspace separation. Due to this assumption, such methods are mainly offline and exhibit poor performance when the assumption is not satisfied. This is made evident in state-of-the-art methods that relax this assumption by using piecewise affine spaces and spectral clustering techniques to achieve better results. In this paper, we formulate the problem of motion segmentation as that of manifold separation. We then show how label propagation can be used in an online framework to achieve manifold separation. The performance of our framework is evaluated on a benchmark dataset and achieves competitive performance while being online.</p><p>6 0.060222544 <a title="329-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic_Segmentation_without_Annotating_Segments.html">379 iccv-2013-Semantic Segmentation without Annotating Segments</a></p>

<p>Author: Sarah Parisot, William Wells_III, Stéphane Chemouny, Hugues Duffau, Nikos Paragios</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based methods have become popular in recent years and have successfully addressed tasks like segmentation and deformable registration. Their main strength is optimality of the obtained solution while their main limitation is the lack of precision due to the grid-like representations and the discrete nature of the quantized search space. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for combined segmentation/registration of brain tumors that adapts graph and sampling resolution according to the image content. To this end we estimate the segmentation and registration marginals towards adaptive graph resolution and intelligent definition of the search space. This information is considered in a hierarchical framework where uncertainties are propagated in a natural manner. State of the art results in the joint segmentation/registration of brain images with low-grade gliomas demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>3 0.65217632 <a title="329-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Minimal_Basis_Facility_Location_for_Subspace_Segmentation.html">264 iccv-2013-Minimal Basis Facility Location for Subspace Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Choon-Meng Lee, Loong-Fah Cheong</p><p>Abstract: In contrast to the current motion segmentation paradigm that assumes independence between the motion subspaces, we approach the motion segmentation problem by seeking the parsimonious basis set that can represent the data. Our formulation explicitly looks for the overlap between subspaces in order to achieve a minimal basis representation. This parsimonious basis set is important for the performance of our model selection scheme because the sharing of basis results in savings of model complexity cost. We propose the use of affinity propagation based method to determine the number of motion. The key lies in the incorporation of a global cost model into the factor graph, serving the role of model complexity. The introduction of this global cost model requires additional message update in the factor graph. We derive an efficient update for the new messages associated with this global cost model. An important step in the use of affinity propagation is the subspace hypotheses generation. We use the row-sparse convex proxy solution as an initialization strategy. We further encourage the selection of subspace hypotheses with shared basis by integrat- ing a discount scheme that lowers the factor graph facility cost based on shared basis. We verified the model selection and classification performance of our proposed method on both the original Hopkins 155 dataset and the more balanced Hopkins 380 dataset.</p><p>4 0.6481123 <a title="329-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Coarse-to-Fine_Semantic_Video_Segmentation_Using_Supervoxel_Trees.html">76 iccv-2013-Coarse-to-Fine Semantic Video Segmentation Using Supervoxel Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Aastha Jain, Shuanak Chatterjee, René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose an exact, general and efficient coarse-to-fine energy minimization strategy for semantic video segmentation. Our strategy is based on a hierarchical abstraction of the supervoxel graph that allows us to minimize an energy defined at the finest level of the hierarchy by minimizing a series of simpler energies defined over coarser graphs. The strategy is exact, i.e., it produces the same solution as minimizing over the finest graph. It is general, i.e., it can be used to minimize any energy function (e.g., unary, pairwise, and higher-order terms) with any existing energy minimization algorithm (e.g., graph cuts and belief propagation). It also gives significant speedups in inference for several datasets with varying degrees of spatio-temporal continuity. We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our strategy relative to existing hierarchical approaches, and the kinds of image and video data that provide the best speedups.</p><p>5 0.6399675 <a title="329-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Distributed_Low-Rank_Subspace_Segmentation.html">122 iccv-2013-Distributed Low-Rank Subspace Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ameet Talwalkar, Lester Mackey, Yadong Mu, Shih-Fu Chang, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Vision problems ranging from image clustering to motion segmentation to semi-supervised learning can naturally be framed as subspace segmentation problems, in which one aims to recover multiple low-dimensional subspaces from noisy and corrupted input data. Low-Rank Representation (LRR), a convex formulation of the subspace segmentation problem, is provably and empirically accurate on small problems but does not scale to the massive sizes of modern vision datasets. Moreover, past work aimed at scaling up low-rank matrix factorization is not applicable to LRR given its non-decomposable constraints. In this work, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for large-scale subspace segmentation that can cope with LRR ’s non-decomposable constraints and maintains LRR ’s strong recovery guarantees. This has immediate implications for the scalability of subspace segmentation, which we demonstrate on a benchmark face recognition dataset and in simulations. We then introduce novel applications of LRR-based subspace segmentation to large-scale semisupervised learning for multimedia event detection, concept detection, and image tagging. In each case, we obtain stateof-the-art results and order-of-magnitude speed ups.</p><p>6 0.63943732 <a title="329-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Flattening_Supervoxel_Hierarchies_by_the_Uniform_Entropy_Slice.html">172 iccv-2013-Flattening Supervoxel Hierarchies by the Uniform Entropy Slice</a></p>

<p>Author: Emanuele Rodolà, Andrea Torsello, Tatsuya Harada, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We consider a parametrized relaxation of the widely adopted quadratic assignment problem (QAP) formulation for minimum distortion correspondence between deformable shapes. In order to control the accuracy/sparsity trade-off we introduce a weighting parameter on the combination of two existing relaxations, namely spectral and game-theoretic. This leads to the introduction of the elastic net penalty function into shape matching problems. In combination with an efficient algorithm to project onto the elastic net ball, we obtain an approach for deformable shape matching with controllable sparsity. Experiments on a standard benchmark confirm the effectiveness of the approach.</p><p>3 0.54284954 <a title="329-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Correntropy_Induced_L2_Graph_for_Robust_Subspace_Clustering.html">94 iccv-2013-Correntropy Induced L2 Graph for Robust Subspace Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jinhui Tang, Min Lin, Liang Lin, Shuicheng Yan, Zhouchen Lin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the robust subspace clustering problem, which aims to cluster the given possibly noisy data points into their underlying subspaces. A large pool of previous subspace clustering methods focus on the graph construction by different regularization of the representation coefficient. We instead focus on the robustness of the model to non-Gaussian noises. We propose a new robust clustering method by using the correntropy induced metric, which is robust for handling the non-Gaussian and impulsive noises. Also we further extend the method for handling the data with outlier rows/features. The multiplicative form of half-quadratic optimization is used to optimize the nonconvex correntropy objective function of the proposed models. Extensive experiments on face datasets well demonstrate that the proposed methods are more robust to corruptions and occlusions.</p><p>4 0.53327107 <a title="329-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Piecewise_Rigid_Scene_Flow.html">317 iccv-2013-Piecewise Rigid Scene Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph Vogel, Konrad Schindler, Stefan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Estimating dense 3D scene flow from stereo sequences remains a challenging task, despite much progress in both classical disparity and 2D optical flow estimation. To overcome the limitations of existing techniques, we introduce a novel model that represents the dynamic 3D scene by a collection of planar, rigidly moving, local segments. Scene flow estimation then amounts to jointly estimating the pixelto-segment assignment, and the 3D position, normal vector, and rigid motion parameters of a plane for each segment. The proposed energy combines an occlusion-sensitive data term with appropriate shape, motion, and segmentation regularizers. Optimization proceeds in two stages: Starting from an initial superpixelization, we estimate the shape and motion parameters of all segments by assigning a proposal from a set of moving planes. Then the pixel-to-segment assignment is updated, while holding the shape and motion parameters of the moving planes fixed. We demonstrate the benefits of our model on different real-world image sets, including the challenging KITTI benchmark. We achieve leading performance levels, exceeding competing 3D scene flow methods, and even yielding better 2D motion estimates than all tested dedicated optical flow techniques.</p><p>5 0.53286082 <a title="329-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Direct_Optimization_of_Frame-to-Frame_Rotation.html">115 iccv-2013-Direct Optimization of Frame-to-Frame Rotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Kneip, Simon Lynen</p><p>Abstract: This work makes use of a novel, recently proposed epipolar constraint for computing the relative pose between two calibrated images. By enforcing the coplanarity of epipolar plane normal vectors, it constrains the three degrees of freedom of the relative rotation between two camera views directly—independently of the translation. The present paper shows how the approach can be extended to n points, and translated into an efficient eigenvalue minimization over the three rotational degrees of freedom. Each iteration in the non-linear optimization has constant execution time, independently of the number of features. Two global optimization approaches are proposed. The first one consists of an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt scheme with randomized initial value, which already leads to stable and accurate results. The second scheme consists of a globally optimal branch-and-bound algorithm based on a bound on the eigenvalue variation derived from symmetric eigenvalue-perturbation theory. Analysis of the cost function reveals insights into the nature of a specific relative pose problem, and outlines the complexity under different conditions. The algorithm shows state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. essential-matrix based solutions, and a frameto-frame application to a video sequence immediately leads to an alternative, real-time visual odometry solution. Note: All algorithms in this paper are made available in the OpenGV library.

<p>Author: Xingyu Zeng, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Cascaded classifiers1 have been widely used in pedestrian detection and achieved great success. These classifiers are trained sequentially without joint optimization. In this paper, we propose a new deep model that can jointly train multi-stage classifiers through several stages of backpropagation. It keeps the score map output by a classifier within a local region and uses it as contextual information to support the decision at the next stage. Through a specific design of the training strategy, this deep architecture is able to simulate the cascaded classifiers by mining hard samples to train the network stage-by-stage. Each classifier handles samples at a different difficulty level. Unsupervised pre-training and specifically designed stage-wise supervised training are used to regularize the optimization problem. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the training strategy helps to avoid overfitting.

<p>Author: Tianfu Wu, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Many object detectors, such as AdaBoost, SVM and deformable part-based models (DPM), compute additive scoring functions at a large number of windows scanned over image pyramid, thus computational efficiency is an important consideration beside accuracy performance. In this paper, we present a framework of learning cost-sensitive decision policy which is a sequence of two-sided thresholds to execute early rejection or early acceptance based on the accumulative scores at each step. A decision policy is said to be optimal if it minimizes an empirical global risk function that sums over the loss of false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP), and the cost of computation. While the risk function is very complex due to high-order connections among the two-sided thresholds, we find its upper bound can be optimized by dynamic programming (DP) efficiently and thus say the learned policy is near-optimal. Given the loss of FN and FP and the cost in three numbers, our method can produce a policy on-the-fly for Adaboost, SVM and DPM. In experiments, we show that our decision policy outperforms state-of-the-art cascade methods significantly in terms of speed with similar accuracy performance.</p><p>4 0.20516136 <a title="44-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Cascaded_Shape_Space_Pruning_for_Robust_Facial_Landmark_Detection.html">70 iccv-2013-Cascaded Shape Space Pruning for Robust Facial Landmark Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaowei Zhao, Shiguang Shan, Xiujuan Chai, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel cascaded face shape space pruning algorithm for robust facial landmark detection. Through progressively excluding the incorrect candidate shapes, our algorithm can accurately and efficiently achieve the globally optimal shape configuration. Specifically, individual landmark detectors are firstly applied to eliminate wrong candidates for each landmark. Then, the candidate shape space is further pruned by jointly removing incorrect shape configurations. To achieve this purpose, a discriminative structure classifier is designed to assess the candidate shape configurations. Based on the learned discriminative structure classifier, an efficient shape space pruning strategy is proposed to quickly reject most incorrect candidate shapes while preserve the true shape. The proposed algorithm is carefully evaluated on a large set of real world face images. In addition, comparison results on the publicly available BioID and LFW face databases demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><p>5 0.19360629 <a title="44-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Face_Detector_Training_Using_Tailored_Views.html">157 iccv-2013-Fast Face Detector Training Using Tailored Views</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristina Scherbaum, James Petterson, Rogerio S. Feris, Volker Blanz, Hans-Peter Seidel</p><p>Abstract: Face detection is an important task in computer vision and often serves as the first step for a variety of applications. State-of-the-art approaches use efficient learning algorithms and train on large amounts of manually labeled imagery. Acquiring appropriate training images, however, is very time-consuming and does not guarantee that the collected training data is representative in terms of data variability. Moreover, available data sets are often acquired under controlled settings, restricting, for example, scene illumination or 3D head pose to a narrow range. This paper takes a look into the automated generation of adaptive training samples from a 3D morphable face model. Using statistical insights, the tailored training data guarantees full data variability and is enriched by arbitrary facial attributes such as age or body weight. Moreover, it can automatically adapt to environmental constraints, such as illumination or viewing angle of recorded video footage from surveillance cameras. We use the tailored imagery to train a new many-core imple- mentation of Viola Jones ’ AdaBoost object detection framework. The new implementation is not only faster but also enables the use of multiple feature channels such as color features at training time. In our experiments we trained seven view-dependent face detectors and evaluate these on the Face Detection Data Set and Benchmark (FDDB). Our experiments show that the use of tailored training imagery outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on this challenging dataset.</p><p>6 0.18574965 <a title="44-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminatively_Trained_Templates_for_3D_Object_Detection%3A_A_Real_Time_Scalable_Approach.html">121 iccv-2013-Discriminatively Trained Templates for 3D Object Detection: A Real Time Scalable Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Haoxiang Li, Gang Hua, Zhe Lin, Jonathan Brandt, Jianchao Yang</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised detector adaptation algorithm to adapt any offline trained face detector to a specific collection of images, and hence achieve better accuracy. The core of our detector adaptation algorithm is a probabilistic elastic part (PEP) model, which is offline trained with a set of face examples. It produces a statisticallyaligned part based face representation, namely the PEP representation. To adapt a general face detector to a collection of images, we compute the PEP representations of the candidate detections from the general face detector, and then train a discriminative classifier with the top positives and negatives. Then we re-rank all the candidate detections with this classifier. This way, a face detector tailored to the statistics of the specific image collection is adapted from the original detector. We present extensive results on three datasets with two state-of-the-art face detectors. The significant improvement of detection accuracy over these state- of-the-art face detectors strongly demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed face detector adaptation algorithm.</p><p>4 0.69513786 <a title="44-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-stage_Contextual_Deep_Learning_for_Pedestrian_Detection.html">279 iccv-2013-Multi-stage Contextual Deep Learning for Pedestrian Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Sakrapee Paisitkriangkrai, Chunhua Shen, Anton Van Den Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Many typical applications of object detection operate within a prescribed false-positive range. In this situation the performance of a detector should be assessed on the basis of the area under the ROC curve over that range, rather than over the full curve, as the performance outside the range is irrelevant. This measure is labelled as the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC). Effective cascade-based classification, for example, depends on training node classifiers that achieve the maximal detection rate at a moderate false positive rate, e.g., around 40% to 50%. We propose a novel ensemble learning method which achieves a maximal detection rate at a user-defined range of false positive rates by directly optimizing the partial AUC using structured learning. By optimizing for different ranges of false positive rates, the proposed method can be used to train either a single strong classifier or a node classifier forming part of a cascade classifier. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors using the pro- posed structured ensemble learning method.</p><p>6 0.63883501 <a title="44-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-channel_Correlation_Filters.html">277 iccv-2013-Multi-channel Correlation Filters</a></p>

Range data produced by commodity handheld cameras suffers from high-frequency errors and low-frequency distortion. Our approach deals with both sources of error by reconstructing locally smooth scene fragments and letting these fragments deform in order to align to each other. We develop a volumetric registration formulation that leverages the smoothness of the deformation to make optimization practical for large scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially increases the fidelity of complex scene geometry reconstructed with commodity handheld cameras.</p><p>2 0.79855698 <a title="44-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Subpixel_Scanning_Invariant_to_Indirect_Lighting_Using_Quadratic_Code_Length.html">407 iccv-2013-Subpixel Scanning Invariant to Indirect Lighting Using Quadratic Code Length</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolas Martin, Vincent Couture, Sébastien Roy</p><p>Abstract: We present a scanning method that recovers dense subpixel camera-projector correspondence without requiring any photometric calibration nor preliminary knowledge of their relative geometry. Subpixel accuracy is achieved by considering several zero-crossings defined by the difference between pairs of unstructured patterns. We use gray-level band-pass white noise patterns that increase robustness to indirect lighting and scene discontinuities. Simulated and experimental results show that our method recovers scene geometry with high subpixel precision, and that it can handle many challenges of active reconstruction systems. We compare our results to state of the art methods such as micro phase shifting and modulated phase shifting.</p><p>3 0.77213907 <a title="44-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Motion_for_Every_Visible_Point.html">441 iccv-2013-Video Motion for Every Visible Point</a></p>
<p>Author: Susanna Ricco, Carlo Tomasi</p><p>Abstract: Dense motion of image points over many video frames can provide important information about the world. However, occlusions and drift make it impossible to compute long motionpaths by merely concatenating opticalflow vectors between consecutive frames. Instead, we solve for entire paths directly, and flag the frames in which each is visible. As in previous work, we anchor each path to a unique pixel which guarantees an even spatial distribution of paths. Unlike earlier methods, we allow paths to be anchored in any frame. By explicitly requiring that at least one visible path passes within a small neighborhood of every pixel, we guarantee complete coverage of all visible points in all frames. We achieve state-of-the-art results on real sequences including both rigid and non-rigid motions with significant occlusions.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.768987 <a title="44-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Adapting_Classification_Cascades_to_New_Domains.html">44 iccv-2013-Adapting Classification Cascades to New Domains</a></p>
<p>Author: Vidit Jain, Sachin Sudhakar Farfade</p><p>Abstract: Classification cascades have been very effective for object detection. Such a cascade fails to perform well in data domains with variations in appearances that may not be captured in the training examples. This limited generalization severely restricts the domains for which they can be used effectively. A common approach to address this limitation is to train a new cascade of classifiers from scratch for each of the new domains. Building separate detectors for each of the different domains requires huge annotation and computational effort, making it not scalable to a large number of data domains. Here we present an algorithm for quickly adapting a pre-trained cascade of classifiers using a small number oflabeledpositive instancesfrom a different yet similar data domain. In our experiments with images of human babies and human-like characters from movies, we demonstrate that the adapted cascade significantly outperforms both of the original cascade and the one trained from scratch using the given training examples. –</p><p>5 0.76863265 <a title="44-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Data_Association%3A_Bayesian_Model_Selection_for_Multi-target_Tracking.html">230 iccv-2013-Latent Data Association: Bayesian Model Selection for Multi-target Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Aleksandr V. Segal, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel parametrization of the data association problem for multi-target tracking. In our formulation, the number of targets is implicitly inferred together with the data association, effectively solving data association and model selection as a single inference problem. The novel formulation allows us to interpret data association and tracking as a single Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS). We compute an approximate posterior solution to this problem using a dynamic programming/message passing technique. This inference-based approach allows us to incorporate richer probabilistic models into the tracking system. In particular, we incorporate inference over inliers/outliers and track termination times into the system. We evaluate our approach on publicly available datasets and demonstrate results competitive with, and in some cases exceeding the state of the art.</p><p>6 0.76043576 <a title="44-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Alternating_Regression_Forests_for_Object_Detection_and_Pose_Estimation.html">47 iccv-2013-Alternating Regression Forests for Object Detection and Pose Estimation</a></p>

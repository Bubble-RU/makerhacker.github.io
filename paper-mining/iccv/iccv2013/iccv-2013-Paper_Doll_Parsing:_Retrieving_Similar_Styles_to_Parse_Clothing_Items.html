Occupation Recognition in a Photo via Social Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming Shao, Liangyue Li, Yun Fu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of recognizing occupations of multiple people with arbitrary poses in a photo. Previous work utilizing single person ’s nearly frontal clothing information and fore/background context preliminarily proves that occupation recognition is computationally feasible in computer vision. However, in practice, multiple people with arbitrary poses are common in a photo, and recognizing their occupations is even more challenging. We argue that with appropriately built visual attributes, co-occurrence, and spatial configuration model that is learned through structure SVM, we can recognize multiple people ’s occupations in a photo simultaneously. To evaluate our method’s performance, we conduct extensive experiments on a new well-labeled occupation database with 14 representative occupations and over 7K images. Results on this database validate our method’s effectiveness and show that occupation recognition is solvable in a more general case.</p><p>3 0.14612731 <a title="306-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_Deformable_Mixture_Parsing_Model_with_Parselets.html">8 iccv-2013-A Deformable Mixture Parsing Model with Parselets</a></p>
<p>Author: Jian Dong, Qiang Chen, Wei Xia, Zhongyang Huang, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of human parsing, namely partitioning the human body into semantic regions, by using the novel Parselet representation. Previous works often consider solving the problem of human pose estimation as the prerequisite of human parsing. We argue that these approaches cannot obtain optimal pixel level parsing due to the inconsistent targets between these tasks. In this paper, we propose to use Parselets as the building blocks of our parsing model. Parselets are a group of parsable segments which can generally be obtained by lowlevel over-segmentation algorithms and bear strong semantic meaning. We then build a Deformable Mixture Parsing Model (DMPM) for human parsing to simultaneously handle the deformation and multi-modalities of Parselets. The proposed model has two unique characteristics: (1) the possible numerous modalities of Parselet ensembles are exhibited as the “And-Or” structure of sub-trees; (2) to further solve the practical problem of Parselet occlusion or absence, we directly model the visibility property at some leaf nodes. The DMPM thus directly solves the problem of human parsing by searching for the best graph configura- tionfrom apool ofParselet hypotheses without intermediate tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the encouraging performance of the proposed approach.</p><p>4 0.14432338 <a title="306-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Handling_Uncertain_Tags_in_Visual_Recognition.html">191 iccv-2013-Handling Uncertain Tags in Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Arash Vahdat, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: Gathering accurate training data for recognizing a set of attributes or tags on images or videos is a challenge. Obtaining labels via manual effort or from weakly-supervised data typically results in noisy training labels. We develop the FlipSVM, a novel algorithm for handling these noisy, structured labels. The FlipSVM models label noise by “flipping ” labels on training examples.

<p>Author: Phillip Isola, Ce Liu</p><p>Abstract: To quickly synthesize complex scenes, digital artists often collage together visual elements from multiple sources: for example, mountainsfrom New Zealand behind a Scottish castle with wisps of Saharan sand in front. In this paper, we propose to use a similar process in order to parse a scene. We model a scene as a collage of warped, layered objects sampled from labeled, reference images. Each object is related to the rest by a set of support constraints. Scene parsing is achieved through analysis-by-synthesis. Starting with a dataset of labeled exemplar scenes, we retrieve a dictionary of candidate object segments thaOt miginaatl icmhag ea querEdyi eimd im-a age. We then combine elements of this set into a “scene collage ” that explains the query image. Beyond just assigning object labels to pixels, scene collaging produces a lot more information such as the number of each type of object in the scene, how they support one another, the ordinal depth of each object, and, to some degree, occluded content. We exploit this representation for several applications: image editing, random scene synthesis, and image-to-anaglyph.</p><p>6 0.13619672 <a title="306-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_View-Invariant_Sparse_Representations_for_Cross-View_Action_Recognition.html">244 iccv-2013-Learning View-Invariant Sparse Representations for Cross-View Action Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Basura Fernando, Tinne Tuytelaars</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a new method for object retrieval starting from multiple query images. The use of multiple queries allows for a more expressive formulation of the query object including, e.g., different viewpoints and/or viewing conditions. This, in turn, leads to more diverse and more accurate retrieval results. When no query images are available to the user, they can easily be retrieved from the internet using a standard image search engine. In particular, we propose a new method based on pattern mining. Using the minimal description length principle, we derive the most suitable set of patterns to describe the query object, with patterns corresponding to local feature configurations. This results in apowerful object-specific mid-level image representation. The archive can then be searched efficiently for similar images based on this representation, using a combination of two inverted file systems. Since the patterns already encode local spatial information, good results on several standard image retrieval datasets are obtained even without costly re-ranking based on geometric verification.</p><p>6 0.47862759 <a title="306-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Scene_Collaging%3A_Analysis_and_Synthesis_of_Natural_Images_with_Semantic_Layers.html">375 iccv-2013-Scene Collaging: Analysis and Synthesis of Natural Images with Semantic Layers</a></p>

<p>Author: Tobias Weyand, Bastian Leibe</p><p>Abstract: Current landmark recognition engines are typically aimed at recognizing building-scale landmarks, but miss interesting details like portals, statues or windows. This is because they use a flat clustering that summarizes all photos of a building facade in one cluster. We propose Hierarchical Iconoid Shift, a novel landmark clustering algorithm capable of discovering such details. Instead of just a collection of clusters, the output of HIS is a set of dendrograms describing the detail hierarchy of a landmark. HIS is based on the novel Hierarchical Medoid Shift clustering algorithm that performs a continuous mode search over the complete scale space. HMS is completely parameter-free, has the same complexity as Medoid Shift and is easy to parallelize. We evaluate HIS on 800k images of 34 landmarks and show that it can extract an often surprising amount of detail and structure that can be applied, e.g., to provide a mobile user with more detailed information on a landmark or even to extend the landmark’s Wikipedia article.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78067827 <a title="306-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Paper_Doll_Parsing%3A_Retrieving_Similar_Styles_to_Parse_Clothing_Items.html">306 iccv-2013-Paper Doll Parsing: Retrieving Similar Styles to Parse Clothing Items</a></p>

<p>Author: Gemma Roig, Xavier Boix, Roderick De_Nijs, Sebastian Ramos, Koljia Kuhnlenz, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Most MAP inference algorithms for CRFs optimize an energy function knowing all the potentials. In this paper, we focus on CRFs where the computational cost of instantiating the potentials is orders of magnitude higher than MAP inference. This is often the case in semantic image segmentation, where most potentials are instantiated by slow classifiers fed with costly features. We introduce Active MAP inference 1) to on-the-fly select a subset of potentials to be instantiated in the energy function, leaving the rest of the parameters of the potentials unknown, and 2) to estimate the MAP labeling from such incomplete energy function. Results for semantic segmentation benchmarks, namely PASCAL VOC 2010 [5] and MSRC-21 [19], show that Active MAP inference achieves similar levels of accuracy but with major efficiency gains.</p><p>4 0.71455646 <a title="306-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-The_Interestingness_of_Images.html">416 iccv-2013-The Interestingness of Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Gygli, Helmut Grabner, Hayko Riemenschneider, Fabian Nater, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: We investigate human interest in photos. Based on our own and others ’psychological experiments, we identify various cues for “interestingness ”, namely aesthetics, unusualness and general preferences. For the ranking of retrieved images, interestingness is more appropriate than cues proposed earlier. Interestingness is, for example, correlated with what people believe they will remember. This is opposed to actual memorability, which is uncorrelated to both of them. We introduce a set of features computationally capturing the three main aspects of visual interestingness that we propose and build an interestingness predictor from them. Its performance is shown on three datasets with varying context, reflecting diverse levels of prior knowledge of the viewers.</p><p>5 0.64732701 <a title="306-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Large-Scale_Multi-resolution_Surface_Reconstruction_from_RGB-D_Sequences.html">228 iccv-2013-Large-Scale Multi-resolution Surface Reconstruction from RGB-D Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Steinbrücker, Christian Kerl, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to generate highly detailed, textured 3D models of large environments from RGB-D sequences. Our system runs in real-time on a standard desktop PC with a state-of-the-art graphics card. To reduce the memory consumption, we fuse the acquired depth maps and colors in a multi-scale octree representation of a signed distance function. To estimate the camera poses, we construct a pose graph and use dense image alignment to determine the relative pose between pairs of frames. We add edges between nodes when we detect loop-closures and optimize the pose graph to correct for long-term drift. Our implementation is highly parallelized on graphics hardware to achieve real-time performance. More specifically, we can reconstruct, store, and continuously update a colored 3D model of an entire corridor of nine rooms at high levels of detail in real-time on a single GPU with 2.5GB.</p><p>6 0.6465078 <a title="306-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-3D_Scene_Understanding_by_Voxel-CRF.html">2 iccv-2013-3D Scene Understanding by Voxel-CRF</a></p>

<p>Author: Yangqing Jia, Mei Han</p><p>Abstract: It is known that purely low-level saliency cues such as frequency does not lead to a good salient object detection result, requiring high-level knowledge to be adopted for successful discovery of task-independent salient objects. In this paper, we propose an efficient way to combine such high-level saliency priors and low-level appearance models. We obtain the high-level saliency prior with the objectness algorithm to find potential object candidates without the need of category information, and then enforce the consistency among the salient regions using a Gaussian MRF with the weights scaled by diverse density that emphasizes the influence of potential foreground pixels. Our model obtains saliency maps that assign high scores for the whole salient object, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets covering various foreground statistics.</p><p>3 0.63096058 <a title="372-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Salient_Region_Detection_by_UFO%3A_Uniqueness%2C_Focusness_and_Objectness.html">374 iccv-2013-Salient Region Detection by UFO: Uniqueness, Focusness and Objectness</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Jiang, Haibin Ling, Jingyi Yu, Jingliang Peng</p><p>Abstract: The goal of saliency detection is to locate important pixels or regions in an image which attract humans ’ visual attention the most. This is a fundamental task whose output may serve as the basis for further computer vision tasks like segmentation, resizing, tracking and so forth. In this paper we propose a novel salient region detection algorithm by integrating three important visual cues namely uniqueness, focusness and objectness (UFO). In particular, uniqueness captures the appearance-derived visual contrast; focusness reflects the fact that salient regions are often photographed in focus; and objectness helps keep completeness of detected salient regions. While uniqueness has been used for saliency detection for long, it is new to integrate focusness and objectness for this purpose. In fact, focusness and objectness both provide important saliency information complementary of uniqueness. In our experiments using public benchmark datasets, we show that, even with a simple pixel level combination of the three components, the proposed approach yields significant improve- ment compared with previously reported methods.</p><p>4 0.54727972 <a title="372-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Contextual_Hypergraph_Modeling_for_Salient_Object_Detection.html">91 iccv-2013-Contextual Hypergraph Modeling for Salient Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xi Li, Yao Li, Chunhua Shen, Anthony Dick, Anton Van_Den_Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Salient object detection aims to locate objects that capture human attention within images. Previous approaches often pose this as a problem of image contrast analysis. In this work, we model an image as a hypergraph that utilizes a set of hyperedges to capture the contextual properties of image pixels or regions. As a result, the problem of salient object detection becomes one of finding salient vertices and hyperedges in the hypergraph. The main advantage of hypergraph modeling is that it takes into account each pixel’s (or region ’s) affinity with its neighborhood as well as its separation from image background. Furthermore, we propose an alternative approach based on centerversus-surround contextual contrast analysis, which performs salient object detection by optimizing a cost-sensitive support vector machine (SVM) objective function. Experimental results on four challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches against the stateof-the-art approaches to salient object detection.</p><p>5 0.510342 <a title="372-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Person_Re-identification_by_Salience_Matching.html">313 iccv-2013-Person Re-identification by Salience Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Zhao, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Human salience is distinctive and reliable information in matching pedestrians across disjoint camera views. In this paper, we exploit the pairwise salience distribution relationship between pedestrian images, and solve the person re-identification problem by proposing a salience matching strategy. To handle the misalignment problem in pedestrian images, patch matching is adopted and patch salience is estimated. Matching patches with inconsistent salience brings penalty. Images of the same person are recognized by minimizing the salience matching cost. Furthermore, our salience matching is tightly integrated with patch matching in a unified structural RankSVM learning framework. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on the VIPeR dataset and the CUHK Campus dataset. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both datasets.</p><p>6 0.5091086 <a title="372-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_Salient_Region_Detection_with_Soft_Image_Abstraction.html">137 iccv-2013-Efficient Salient Region Detection with Soft Image Abstraction</a></p>

An image is characterized by a set of binary images, which are generated by randomly thresholding the image ’s color channels. Based on a Gestalt principle of figure-ground segregation, BMS computes saliency maps by analyzing the topological structure of Boolean maps. BMS is simple to implement and efficient to run. Despite its simplicity, BMS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with ten leading methods on five eye tracking datasets.

<p>Author: Shicheng Zheng, Li Xu, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: We handle a special type of motion blur considering that cameras move primarily forward or backward. Solving this type of blur is of unique practical importance since nearly all car, traffic and bike-mounted cameras follow out-ofplane translational motion. We start with the study of geometric models and analyze the difficulty of existing methods to deal with them. We also propose a solution accounting for depth variation. Homographies associated with different 3D planes are considered and solved for in an optimization framework. Our method is verified on several natural image examples that cannot be satisfyingly dealt with by previous methods.</p><p>2 0.940521 <a title="372-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Scene_Deblurring.html">129 iccv-2013-Dynamic Scene Deblurring</a></p>
<p>Author: Tae Hyun Kim, Byeongjoo Ahn, Kyoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: Most conventional single image deblurring methods assume that the underlying scene is static and the blur is caused by only camera shake. In this paper, in contrast to this restrictive assumption, we address the deblurring problem of general dynamic scenes which contain multiple moving objects as well as camera shake. In case of dynamic scenes, moving objects and background have different blur motions, so the segmentation of the motion blur is required for deblurring each distinct blur motion accurately. Thus, we propose a novel energy model designed with the weighted sum of multiple blur data models, which estimates different motion blurs and their associated pixelwise weights, and resulting sharp image. In this framework, the local weights are determined adaptively and get high values when the corresponding data models have high data fidelity. And, the weight information is used for the segmentation of the motion blur. Non-local regularization of weights are also incorporated to produce more reliable segmentation results. A convex optimization-based method is used for the solution of the proposed energy model. Exper- imental results demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches in deblurring both dynamic scenes and static scenes.</p><p>3 0.93989187 <a title="372-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Deblurring_by_Example_Using_Dense_Correspondence.html">103 iccv-2013-Deblurring by Example Using Dense Correspondence</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoav Hacohen, Eli Shechtman, Dani Lischinski</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new method for deblurring photos using a sharp reference example that contains some shared content with the blurry photo. Most previous deblurring methods that exploit information from other photos require an accurately registered photo of the same static scene. In contrast, our method aims to exploit reference images where the shared content may have undergone substantial photometric and non-rigid geometric transformations, as these are the kind of reference images most likely to be found in personal photo albums. Our approach builds upon a recent method for examplebased deblurring using non-rigid dense correspondence (NRDC) [11] and extends it in two ways. First, we suggest exploiting information from the reference image not only for blur kernel estimation, but also as a powerful local prior for the non-blind deconvolution step. Second, we introduce a simple yet robust technique for spatially varying blur estimation, rather than assuming spatially uniform blur. Unlike the aboveprevious method, which hasproven successful only with simple deblurring scenarios, we demonstrate that our method succeeds on a variety of real-world examples. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our method and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.93429959 <a title="372-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Saliency_Detection_via_Dense_and_Sparse_Reconstruction.html">372 iccv-2013-Saliency Detection via Dense and Sparse Reconstruction</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohui Li, Huchuan Lu, Lihe Zhang, Xiang Ruan, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a visual saliency detection algorithm from the perspective of reconstruction errors. The image boundaries are first extracted via superpixels as likely cues for background templates, from which dense and sparse appearance models are constructed. For each image region, we first compute dense and sparse reconstruction errors. Second, the reconstruction errors are propagated based on the contexts obtained from K-means clustering. Third, pixel-level saliency is computed by an integration of multi-scale reconstruction errors and refined by an object-biased Gaussian model. We apply the Bayes formula to integrate saliency measures based on dense and sparse reconstruction errors. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against seventeen state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall. In addition, the proposed algorithm is demonstrated to be more effective in highlighting salient objects uniformly and robust to background noise.</p><p>5 0.92636847 <a title="372-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminant_Tracking_Using_Tensor_Representation_with_Semi-supervised_Improvement.html">119 iccv-2013-Discriminant Tracking Using Tensor Representation with Semi-supervised Improvement</a></p>
<p>Author: Jin Gao, Junliang Xing, Weiming Hu, Steve Maybank</p><p>Abstract: Visual tracking has witnessed growing methods in object representation, which is crucial to robust tracking. The dominant mechanism in object representation is using image features encoded in a vector as observations to perform tracking, without considering that an image is intrinsically a matrix, or a 2nd-order tensor. Thus approaches following this mechanism inevitably lose a lot of useful information, and therefore cannot fully exploit the spatial correlations within the 2D image ensembles. In this paper, we address an image as a 2nd-order tensor in its original form, and find a discriminative linear embedding space approximation to the original nonlinear submanifold embedded in the tensor space based on the graph embedding framework. We specially design two graphs for characterizing the intrinsic local geometrical structure of the tensor space, so as to retain more discriminant information when reducing the dimension along certain tensor dimensions. However, spatial correlations within a tensor are not limited to the elements along these dimensions. This means that some part of the discriminant information may not be encoded in the embedding space. We introduce a novel technique called semi-supervised improvement to iteratively adjust the embedding space to compensate for the loss of discriminant information, hence improving the performance of our tracker. Experimental results on challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker.</p><p>6 0.92522508 <a title="372-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Category-Independent_Object-Level_Saliency_Detection.html">71 iccv-2013-Category-Independent Object-Level Saliency Detection</a></p>

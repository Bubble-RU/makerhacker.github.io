</p><p>7 We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using the SHREC’2010 robust correspondence benchmark. [sent-8, score-0.11]
</p><p>8 Introduction  The problem of finding correspondences in 3D shapes is an important problem in computer vision and computer graphics. [sent-11, score-0.449]
</p><p>9 In particular, the reliable detection of correspondences in non-rigid shapes has received notable attention in recent years. [sent-12, score-0.458]
</p><p>10 Additionally, in real-world applications, one would expect shapes containing perturbations such as noise, topological changes, scale, and so on. [sent-14, score-0.25]
</p><p>11 Therefore, it is imperative to devise robust and efficient techniques to finding reliable correspondences in non-rigid shapes (possibly with perturbations). [sent-15, score-0.543]
</p><p>12 The most used approach to tackle this problem involves finding a mapping between sparse sets of surface points (keypoints). [sent-16, score-0.111]
</p><p>13 This problem commonly is formulated as an optimization problem that involves the matching of local descriptors and some criterion for geometric consistency. [sent-17, score-0.187]
</p><p>14 Generally, the optimization is carried out through an integer quadratic program. [sent-18, score-0.119]
</p><p>15 Due to the combinatorial nature of the correspondence problem, we need to search strategies to efficiently solve the problem. [sent-19, score-0.11]
</p><p>16 Additionally, we need to take into account the robustness against mesh perturbations. [sent-20, score-0.212]
</p><p>17 In this paper, we propose an algorithm to find correspondences in nonrigid shapes based on a hierarchical decomposition. [sent-21, score-0.495]
</p><p>18 Recent studies have shown that it is possible to obtain robust decompositions on 3D meshes [9, 15]. [sent-22, score-0.087]
</p><p>19 Our motivation is the fact that if two shapes are near-isometric, they should  have regions which are near-isometric as well. [sent-23, score-0.263]
</p><p>20 If a shape S is decomposed in a set of regions S1, S2 , . [sent-24, score-0.166]
</p><p>21 This idea can be applied again on regions recursively. [sent-31, score-0.072]
</p><p>22 In light of this observation, we propose an algorithm to build a decomposition tree of a given shape. [sent-32, score-0.476]
</p><p>23 Internal nodes represent regions and leaf nodes represent keypoints. [sent-33, score-0.375]
</p><p>24 As one traverses the tree in depth, the shape structures are smaller. [sent-34, score-0.249]
</p><p>25 In addition, we propose a hierarchical matching algorithm which takes two decomposition trees as input and performs in a breadth-first manner. [sent-35, score-0.552]
</p><p>26 This algorithm first matches regions in high levels of the trees and propagates the process until reaching the leaf nodes, where the keypoints are finally matched. [sent-36, score-0.857]
</p><p>27 The decomposition tree is similar in spirit to the component tree proposed by Litman et al. [sent-37, score-0.625]
</p><p>28 The main difference is that our representation is designed to support the subsequent matching process. [sent-39, score-0.091]
</p><p>29 In addition, in contrast to the component tree (which makes use of diffusion geometry), our method uses the distribution of keypoints on the surface to guide the decomposition process. [sent-40, score-1.009]
</p><p>30 Regarding efficiency, our matching 881177  algorithm has the ability to reduce the searching space of correspondences by making use of the hierarchical decom-  position. [sent-42, score-0.426]
</p><p>31 Once two regions correspond (because their internal nodes matched), we only look for correspondences in the associated sub-trees. [sent-43, score-0.462]
</p><p>32 This allows us to discard a considerable amount of matches early in the process. [sent-44, score-0.103]
</p><p>33 With respect to the robustness, we take advantage of the provably good properties of diffusion-based descriptors in the context of non-rigid matching to obtain discriminative descriptions for regions and keypoints. [sent-45, score-0.257]
</p><p>34 In addition, the decomposition process is guided by the distribution of robust keypoints on the shape’s surface. [sent-46, score-0.845]
</p><p>35 First, we present a novel representation for non-rigid shapes: the decomposition tree. [sent-48, score-0.327]
</p><p>36 This structure characterizes the hierarchical decomposition process, where the root node contains the original shape and leaf nodes contain keypoints. [sent-49, score-0.849]
</p><p>37 Second, we develop a matching algorithm that takes advantage of the decomposition trees to find correspondences. [sent-50, score-0.464]
</p><p>38 Our algorithm is efficient since it allows us to discard matches in early stages of the process. [sent-51, score-0.14]
</p><p>39 Section 3 describes our hierarchical decomposition algorithm and the related decomposition tree. [sent-54, score-0.742]
</p><p>40 Section 4 is devoted to present the matching algorithm. [sent-55, score-0.091]
</p><p>41 Section 5 presents our experiments and discusses the obtained results. [sent-56, score-0.082]
</p><p>42 Related Works  The matching problem can be formulated as a minimumdistortion problem. [sent-59, score-0.128]
</p><p>43 Given two near-isometric shapes, the goal is to find a correspondence set that minimizes the distortion between the two shapes. [sent-60, score-0.146]
</p><p>44 [5] proposed to match two shapes by embedding one into another. [sent-63, score-0.224]
</p><p>45 Shapes were treated as metric spaces using the geodesic distance as metric. [sent-64, score-0.166]
</p><p>46 A conformal flattening was applied to shapes, where it was possible to apply a M ¨obius transform for triplets of points. [sent-67, score-0.132]
</p><p>47 The deformation energy caused by the triplets in the rest of the points of the mesh allows us to compute a vote for each couple of correspondences. [sent-68, score-0.267]
</p><p>48 Many methods solve the problem iteratively through a process of correspondence refinement. [sent-70, score-0.11]
</p><p>49 [10] exploited the use of heat kernel maps to find a unique reliable correspondence. [sent-72, score-0.2]
</p><p>50 Subsequently, an iterative method propagates the correspondence set according to a kernel map optimization method. [sent-73, score-0.218]
</p><p>51 Also, a RANSAClike method to find correspondences was proposed in [18]. [sent-74, score-0.216]
</p><p>52 Then, the search of correspondences was guided by a best-first algorithm that models the quality of the correspondence set with a geodesic distortion. [sent-81, score-0.563]
</p><p>53 [19] proposed a method which resembles the matching of correspondences in images. [sent-83, score-0.339]
</p><p>54 Adaptations of DoG and HoG were used for selecting and describing keypoints on the mesh surface. [sent-84, score-0.701]
</p><p>55 Next, a simple matching algorithm that takes the best match between descriptors was presented. [sent-85, score-0.15]
</p><p>56 Also, Sahillio g˘lu and Yemez [12] stated the correspondence problem as a graph problem. [sent-86, score-0.172]
</p><p>57 They proposed to find an initial matching over a bipartite graph, and subsequently a greedy approach was responsible of adding and refining new correspondences. [sent-87, score-0.251]
</p><p>58 [13] proposed a probabilistic method to find dense correspondences based on a initial greedy-based sparse matches. [sent-89, score-0.216]
</p><p>59 A common approach is to state the problem of finding correspondences as an integer program. [sent-90, score-0.338]
</p><p>60 Dubrovina and Kimmel [6] described a mesh point using the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. [sent-91, score-0.328]
</p><p>61 The matching algorithm was stated as a quadratic integer program which takes into account a distortion function to optimize. [sent-92, score-0.308]
</p><p>62 [11] formulated the minimum-distortion prob-  lem with a quadratic optimization function. [sent-94, score-0.106]
</p><p>63 The solution was obtained with a game-theoretic strategy and a merging algorithm to get the final correspondence set. [sent-95, score-0.11]
</p><p>64 [20] devised a high-order matching algorithm based on the M ¨obius transform to populate the correspondences from an initial set. [sent-97, score-0.346]
</p><p>65 They derived a dual decomposition ofthe original problem which involved an integer linear problem. [sent-98, score-0.407]
</p><p>66 The Decomposition Tree In this section, we present the decomposition algorithm. [sent-100, score-0.327]
</p><p>67 It has two stages: the pre-processing step and the generation of the decomposition tree. [sent-101, score-0.327]
</p><p>68 Our approach to decompose a mesh is inspired in the our method to detect keycomponents on shapes [15]. [sent-102, score-0.403]
</p><p>69 Pre-processing Given a 3D shape X, we compute a set of keypoints KX using the Harris 3D algorithm [14]. [sent-105, score-0.504]
</p><p>70 Subsequently, we calculate the geodesic distances between each pair ofkeypoints using the fast marching method [7]. [sent-106, score-0.363]
</p><p>71 These distances will be 881188  used to control the geometric consistency of the correspondence set in the matching algorithm. [sent-107, score-0.259]
</p><p>72 Since the decomposition method is based on the distribution of keypoints on the shape’s surface, we propose a heuristic to discard isolated keypoints. [sent-108, score-0.922]
</p><p>73 The heuristic consists of analyzing the distribution of geodesic distances of  a keypoint. [sent-109, score-0.26]
</p><p>74 Let Dpv be the geodesic distances from a keypoint v to its p nearest keypoints. [sent-110, score-0.3]
</p><p>75 We define the density of a keypoint v as  density(v) =mmeeaann((DD3vnv)),  (1)  where n = |KX | . [sent-111, score-0.155]
</p><p>76 Grouped keypoints are expected to have a small mean(Dv3) compared to mean(Dvn), yielding a high density value. [sent-112, score-0.526]
</p><p>77 In contrast, isolated keypoints will have more similar values for these two quantities, with the density approaching to one. [sent-113, score-0.608]
</p><p>78 Therefore, keypoints with a low density value should be discarded. [sent-114, score-0.526]
</p><p>79 We remove keypoints with density(v) < 30 from KX . [sent-115, score-0.447]
</p><p>80 In addition, for each remaining keypoint in KX, our method computes two descriptors which are based on diffusion geometry: HKS (heat kernel signatures [16]) and WKS (wave kernel signatures [1]). [sent-117, score-0.414]
</p><p>81 Both descriptors are computed from the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the shape. [sent-118, score-0.175]
</p><p>82 k≥1 and where λk and φk (·) are respectively the eigenvalues and  eigenfunctions of the( Laplace-Beltrami operator. [sent-124, score-0.116]
</p><p>83 The heat kernel signature is a collection of low-pass filters which inhibit high frequencies. [sent-132, score-0.268]
</p><p>84 In contrast, the wave kernel signature is a collection of band-pass filters which reduces the impact of low frequencies, allowing a better feature localization. [sent-134, score-0.202]
</p><p>85 The former is used for describing  contains the original mesh and its related data. [sent-136, score-0.254]
</p><p>86 The last level contains smaller regions from the head. [sent-138, score-0.072]
</p><p>87 regions in the internal nodes of our decomposition tree and the latter is used for describing keypoints in the leaf nodes. [sent-139, score-1.32]
</p><p>88 In summary, after the pre-processing step, we have the following information: a set of keypoints KX, the complete set of geodesic distances between keypoints, and descriptors (HKS and WKS) for each keypoint. [sent-140, score-0.73]
</p><p>89 Decomposition Our decomposition algorithm relies on the distribution of keypoints on the shape’s surface. [sent-143, score-0.774]
</p><p>90 Our algorithm performs a hierarchical clustering in the geodesic space of keypoints. [sent-144, score-0.254]
</p><p>91 More specifically, the algorithm first looks for large  groups ofkeypoints, and recursively decomposes the groups into smaller groups. [sent-145, score-0.127]
</p><p>92 The decomposition ends when we cannot divide a group into smaller groups or when the area of the region that covers a group is very small relative to the area of the original shape. [sent-147, score-0.367]
</p><p>93 The outcome is a tree which represents the decomposition process. [sent-148, score-0.508]
</p><p>94 1 shows a decomposition tree obtained with our algorithm. [sent-150, score-0.476]
</p><p>95 Furthermore, Algorithm 1 presents the pseudo-code of the decomposition algorithm in detail. [sent-151, score-0.375]
</p><p>96 The input of the decomposition algorithm is a node T, which contains the original shape and all information computed in the pre-processing step (see Sec. [sent-152, score-0.471]
</p><p>97 Technically, the output of this method is a tree with T as root node. [sent-155, score-0.18]
</p><p>98 The first part of the algorithm checks whether it is possible to continue decomposing a node (lines 3-13). [sent-156, score-0.153]
</p><p>99 The first check is through the comparison of areas between the shape at the input node and the original shape. [sent-157, score-0.144]
</p><p>100 If the mesh at node T is 881199  Algorithm 1 GenerateTree(T) Require: Node T Ensure: Node T and its associated tree areaOriginal ← mesh. [sent-158, score-0.448]

<p>Author: Jaesik Park, Sudipta N. Sinha, Yasuyuki Matsushita, Yu-Wing Tai, In So Kweon</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for accurate 3D shape reconstruction using uncalibrated multiview photometric stereo. A coarse mesh reconstructed using multiview stereo is first parameterized using a planar mesh parameterization technique. Subsequently, multiview photometric stereo is performed in the 2D parameter domain of the mesh, where all geometric and photometric cues from multiple images can be treated uniformly. Unlike traditional methods, there is no need for merging view-dependent surface normal maps. Our key contribution is a new photometric stereo based mesh refinement technique that can efficiently reconstruct meshes with extremely fine geometric details by directly estimating a displacement texture map in the 2D parameter domain. We demonstrate that intricate surface geometry can be reconstructed using several challenging datasets containing surfaces with specular reflections, multiple albedos and complex topologies.</p><p>3 0.15099253 <a title="11-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Elastic_Net_Constraints_for_Shape_Matching.html">140 iccv-2013-Elastic Net Constraints for Shape Matching</a></p>

In order to control the accuracy/sparsity trade-off we introduce a weighting parameter on the combination of two existing relaxations, namely spectral and game-theoretic. This leads to the introduction of the elastic net penalty function into shape matching problems. In combination with an efficient algorithm to project onto the elastic net ball, we obtain an approach for deformable shape matching with controllable sparsity. Experiments on a standard benchmark confirm the effectiveness of the approach.</p><p>4 0.13247861 <a title="11-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_Method_of_Perceptual-Based_Shape_Decomposition.html">21 iccv-2013-A Method of Perceptual-Based Shape Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Chang Ma, Zhongqian Dong, Tingting Jiang, Yizhou Wang, Wen Gao</p><p>Abstract: In thispaper, wepropose a novelperception-based shape decomposition method which aims to decompose a shape into semantically meaningful parts. In addition to three popular perception rules (the Minima rule, the Short-cut rule and the Convexity rule) in shape decomposition, we propose a new rule named part-similarity rule to encourage consistent partition of similar parts. The problem is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and is solved by a trust-region method. Experiment results on MPEG-7 dataset show that we can get a more consistent shape decomposition with human perception compared with other state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p>Author: Renliang Weng, Jiwen Lu, Junlin Hu, Gao Yang, Yap-Peng Tan</p><p>Abstract: Over the past two decades, a number of face recognition methods have been proposed in the literature. Most of them use holistic face images to recognize people. However, human faces are easily occluded by other objects in many real-world scenarios and we have to recognize the person of interest from his/her partial faces. In this paper, we propose a new partial face recognition approach by using feature set matching, which is able to align partial face patches to holistic gallery faces automatically and is robust to occlusions and illumination changes. Given each gallery image and probe face patch, we first detect keypoints and extract their local features. Then, we propose a Metric Learned ExtendedRobust PointMatching (MLERPM) method to discriminatively match local feature sets of a pair of gallery and probe samples. Lastly, the similarity of two faces is converted as the distance between two feature sets. Experimental results on three public face databases are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><p>6 0.1230097 <a title="11-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Image_Partitioning_Using_Decision_Trees_with_Structured_Split_Criteria.html">448 iccv-2013-Weakly Supervised Learning of Image Partitioning Using Decision Trees with Structured Split Criteria</a></p>

<p>Author: Ivan Sipiran, Benjamin Bustos</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical method for finding correspondences in non-rigid shapes. We propose a new representation for 3D meshes: the decomposition tree. This structure characterizes the recursive decomposition process of a mesh into regions of interest and keypoints. The internal nodes contain regions of interest (which may be recursively decomposed) and the leaf nodes contain the keypoints to be matched. We also propose a hierarchical matching algorithm that performs in a level-wise manner. The matching process is guided by the similarity between regions in high levels of the tree, until reaching the keypoints stored in the leaves. This allows us to reduce the search space of correspondences, making also the matching process efficient.

<p>Author: Emanuele Rodolà, Andrea Torsello, Tatsuya Harada, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We consider a parametrized relaxation of the widely adopted quadratic assignment problem (QAP) formulation for minimum distortion correspondence between deformable shapes. In order to control the accuracy/sparsity trade-off we introduce a weighting parameter on the combination of two existing relaxations, namely spectral and game-theoretic. This leads to the introduction of the elastic net penalty function into shape matching problems. In combination with an efficient algorithm to project onto the elastic net ball, we obtain an approach for deformable shape matching with controllable sparsity. Experiments on a standard benchmark confirm the effectiveness of the approach.</p><p>3 0.6580044 <a title="11-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Improving_Graph_Matching_via_Density_Maximization.html">214 iccv-2013-Improving Graph Matching via Density Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Chao Wang, Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching has been widely used in various applications in computer vision due to its powerful performance. However, it poses three challenges to image sparse feature matching: (1) The combinatorial nature limits the size of the possible matches; (2) It is sensitive to outliers because the objective function prefers more matches; (3) It works poorly when handling many-to-many object correspondences, due to its assumption of one single cluster for each graph. In this paper, we address these problems with a unified framework—Density Maximization. We propose a graph density local estimator (퐷퐿퐸) to measure the quality of matches. Density Maximization aims to maximize the 퐷퐿퐸 values both locally and globally. The local maximization of 퐷퐿퐸 finds the clusters of nodes as well as eliminates the outliers. The global maximization of 퐷퐿퐸 efficiently refines the matches by exploring a much larger matching space. Our Density Maximization is orthogonal to specific graph matching algorithms. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that it significantly boosts the true matches and enables graph matching to handle both outliers and many-to-many object correspondences.</p><p>4 0.65439302 <a title="11-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Multiple_Non-rigid_Surface_Detection_and_Registration.html">283 iccv-2013-Multiple Non-rigid Surface Detection and Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Wu, Yoshihisa Ijiri, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Detecting and registering nonrigid surfaces are two important research problems for computer vision. Much work has been done with the assumption that there exists only one instance in the image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that detects and registers multiple nonrigid instances of given objects in a cluttered image. Specifically, after we use low level feature points to obtain the initial matches between templates and the input image, a novel high-order affinity graph is constructed to model the consistency of local topology. A hierarchical clustering approach is then used to locate the nonrigid surfaces. To remove the outliers in the cluster, we propose a deterministic annealing approach based on the Thin Plate Spline (TPS) model. The proposed method achieves high accuracy even when the number of outliers is nineteen times larger than the inliers. As the matches may appear sparsely in each instance, we propose a TPS based match growing approach to propagate the matches. Finally, an approach that fuses feature and appearance information is proposed to register each nonrigid surface. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves promis- ing results in detecting and registering multiple non-rigid surfaces in a cluttered scene.</p><p>5 0.60050339 <a title="11-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Optimization_for_Consistent_Multiple_Graph_Matching.html">224 iccv-2013-Joint Optimization for Consistent Multiple Graph Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Junchi Yan, Yu Tian, Hongyuan Zha, Xiaokang Yang, Ya Zhang, Stephen M. Chu</p><p>Abstract: The problem of graph matching in general is NP-hard and approaches have been proposed for its suboptimal solution, most focusing on finding the one-to-one node mapping between two graphs. A more general and challenging problem arises when one aims to find consistent mappings across a number of graphs more than two. Conventional graph pair matching methods often result in mapping inconsistency since the mapping between two graphs can either be determined by pair mapping or by an additional anchor graph. To address this issue, a novel formulation is derived which is maximized via alternating optimization. Our method enjoys several advantages: 1) the mappings are jointly optimized rather than sequentially performed by applying pair matching, allowing the global affinity information across graphs can be propagated and explored; 2) the number of concerned variables to optimize is in linear with the number of graphs, being superior to local pair matching resulting in O(n2) variables; 3) the mapping consistency constraints are analytically satisfied during optimization; and 4) off-the-shelf graph pair matching solvers can be reused under the proposed framework in an ‘out-of-thebox’ fashion. Competitive results on both the synthesized data and the real data are reported, by varying the level of deformation, outliers and edge densities. ∗Corresponding author.

<p>Author: Wonjun Hwang, Kyungshik Roh, Junmo Kim</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel unifying framework using a Markov network to learn the relationship between multiple classifiers in face recognition. We assume that we have several complementary classifiers and assign observation nodes to the features of a query image and hidden nodes to the features of gallery images. We connect each hidden node to its corresponding observation node and to the hidden nodes of other neighboring classifiers. For each observation-hidden node pair, we collect a set of gallery candidates that are most similar to the observation instance, and the relationship between the hidden nodes is captured in terms of the similarity matrix between the collected gallery images. Posterior probabilities in the hidden nodes are computed by the belief-propagation algorithm. The novelty of the proposed framework is the method that takes into account the classifier dependency using the results of each neighboring classifier. We present extensive results on two different evaluation protocols, known and unknown image variation tests, using three different databases, which shows that the proposed framework always leads to good accuracy in face recognition.</p><p>3 0.67849559 <a title="11-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminatively_Trained_Templates_for_3D_Object_Detection%3A_A_Real_Time_Scalable_Approach.html">121 iccv-2013-Discriminatively Trained Templates for 3D Object Detection: A Real Time Scalable Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Reyes Rios-Cabrera, Tinne Tuytelaars</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new method for detecting multiple specific 3D objects in real time. We start from the template-based approach based on the LINE2D/LINEMOD representation introduced recently by Hinterstoisser et al., yet extend it in two ways. First, we propose to learn the templates in a discriminative fashion. We show that this can be done online during the collection of the example images, in just a few milliseconds, and has a big impact on the accuracy of the detector. Second, we propose a scheme based on cascades that speeds up detection. Since detection of an object is fast, new objects can be added with very low cost, making our approach scale well. In our experiments, we easily handle 10-30 3D objects at frame rates above 10fps using a single CPU core. We outperform the state-of-the-art both in terms of speed as well as in terms of accuracy, as validated on 3 different datasets. This holds both when using monocular color images (with LINE2D) and when using RGBD images (with LINEMOD). Moreover, wepropose a challenging new dataset made of12 objects, for future competing methods on monocular color images.</p><p>4 0.67814708 <a title="11-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Motion_Segmentation_Using_Dynamic_Label_Propagation.html">297 iccv-2013-Online Motion Segmentation Using Dynamic Label Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Elqursh, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: The vast majority of work on motion segmentation adopts the affine camera model due to its simplicity. Under the affine model, the motion segmentation problem becomes that of subspace separation. Due to this assumption, such methods are mainly offline and exhibit poor performance when the assumption is not satisfied. This is made evident in state-of-the-art methods that relax this assumption by using piecewise affine spaces and spectral clustering techniques to achieve better results. In this paper, we formulate the problem of motion segmentation as that of manifold separation. We then show how label propagation can be used in an online framework to achieve manifold separation. The performance of our framework is evaluated on a benchmark dataset and achieves competitive performance while being online.</p><p>5 0.64563972 <a title="11-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Locally_Affine_Sparse-to-Dense_Matching_for_Motion_and_Occlusion_Estimation.html">256 iccv-2013-Locally Affine Sparse-to-Dense Matching for Motion and Occlusion Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Marius Leordeanu, Andrei Zanfir, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: Estimating a dense correspondence field between successive video frames, under large displacement, is important in many visual learning and recognition tasks. We propose a novel sparse-to-dense matching method for motion field estimation and occlusion detection. As an alternative to the current coarse-to-fine approaches from the optical flow literature, we start from the higher level of sparse matching with rich appearance and geometric constraints collected over extended neighborhoods, using an occlusion aware, locally affine model. Then, we move towards the simpler, but denser classic flow field model, with an interpolation procedure that offers a natural transition between the sparse and the dense correspondence fields. We experimentally demonstrate that our appearance features and our complex geometric constraintspermit the correct motion estimation even in difficult cases of large displacements and significant appearance changes. We also propose a novel classification method for occlusion detection that works in conjunction with the sparse-to-dense matching model. We validate our approach on the newly released Sintel dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results.</p><p>6 0.60017753 <a title="11-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Feature_Set_Matching_for_Partial_Face_Recognition.html">356 iccv-2013-Robust Feature Set Matching for Partial Face Recognition</a></p>

</p><p>7 Introduction  One of the fundamental assumptions in manifold-based data processing algorithms is that the intrinsic geometry of a manifold is relevant to the data which lie upon it. [sent-10, score-0.49]

</p><p>12 , [7, 13]) are justified in exploiting intrinsic geometry by successes in semi-supervised learning, spectral clustering, and dimensionality reduction applications. [sent-19, score-0.265]
</p><p>13 In this paper, we question a fundamental assumption of manifold-based algorithms. [sent-20, score-0.059]
</p><p>14 It is well known that the extrinsic geometry of M, that is, how M is embedded in an ambient space, is important for image and mesh surface processing. [sent-21, score-0.639]
</p><p>15 However, is the extrinsic geometry relevant at all for high-dimensional data processing? [sent-22, score-0.291]
</p><p>16 The anisotropic diffusion process on manifolds mo-  tivates our question above, and connects the highdimensional data processing problem with low-dimensional image and mesh surface processing (Sec. [sent-24, score-0.901]
</p><p>17 The anisotropic diffusion process exploits the extrinsic (as well as intrinsic) geometry, and we discuss how this can be extended to any sub-manifold with arbitrary dimension and co-dimension. [sent-26, score-0.768]
</p><p>18 This presents a practical diffusion and regularization scheme which can be applied even when the manifold is not observed directly but is indirectly presented as a sampled point cloud (Sec. [sent-27, score-0.664]
</p><p>19 This regularization leads to a re-weighted graph Laplacian, which we evaluate in the context of semi-supervised learning and spectral clustering, and discover that the new algorithm significantly improves the performance over classical graph Laplacian (Sec. [sent-29, score-0.247]
</p><p>20 Anisotropic diffusion on manifolds The Laplace-Beltrami operator Δ on a manifold M is defined from the divergence and gradient operators: Δf = −div grad f,  (1)  where f is a smooth function on M. [sent-32, score-0.708]
</p><p>21 This is one of the most important operators in differential geometry and is applied to describe physical phenomena on M. [sent-33, score-0.221]
</p><p>22 In particular, it is the generator of the isotropic diffusion process:  ∂∂ft= −Δf  (2)  which describes the evolution of f on M as how the values of f spread over time. [sent-34, score-0.509]
</p><p>23 This process is isotropic and homogeneous in the sense that the diffusivity is the same for 888811  any location and any direction on M. [sent-35, score-0.495]
</p><p>24 When f represents an image as a two-dimensional manifold embedded in R3 (x, y, f(x, y)), it can be shown that evolving f according to Equ. [sent-36, score-0.253]
</p><p>25 It is often desirable to non-uniformly distribute the diffusivity, as shown by many image processing applications. [sent-38, score-0.045]
</p><p>26 For instance, in image denoising, important structures such as edges should remain unchanged, so diffusion should be weak near edges. [sent-39, score-0.4]
</p><p>27 Furthermore, diffusion should be stronger in the direction along edges rather than across edges. [sent-40, score-0.425]
</p><p>28 This can be realized with anisotropic diffusion on R2 [19, 18]:  ∂∂ft= −ΔDf := divDgradf,  (3)  where D is a positive definite operator that controls the strength and direction of diffusion. [sent-41, score-0.769]
</p><p>29 [19], construct D from the tensor product of gradf with itself. [sent-43, score-0.039]
</p><p>30 A similar approach has also been taken for processing a two-dimensional surface embedded in R3. [sent-46, score-0.248]
</p><p>31 A typical application is surface processing where f represents the three-dimensional locations of sam-  pled surface points in R3 [6, 5, 21]. [sent-47, score-0.257]
</p><p>32 In this context, D can be constructed based on how the surfaces are curved in R3. [sent-48, score-0.156]
</p><p>33 We wish the diffusivity to be strong for planar regions and weak across highly curved regions. [sent-49, score-0.515]
</p><p>34 [5] proposed constructing D based on the principal curvatures and the corresponding principal directions at each location on the surface. [sent-51, score-0.176]
</p><p>35 The resulting diffusion process smooths flat regions and enhances ridges on the surface. [sent-52, score-0.353]
</p><p>36 A similar effect can also be obtained by diffusing surface normal vectors using mean and Gaussian curvatures [21]. [sent-53, score-0.361]
</p><p>37 Anisotropic diffusion has been successful in processing two-dimensional objects embedded in R3 such as images and surfaces (in which the normal is uniquely defined up to the change of sign); however, its application to highdimensional data has not yet been explored. [sent-54, score-0.724]
</p><p>38 The aim of our paper is to extend this framework to construct a generator of anisotropic diffusion processes (ΔD) and, with it, to build a discretized anisotropic regularizer on X. [sent-55, score-0.944]

</p><p>46 In this example, the red arrows pass through planar regions, and here diffusivity should be strong in the directions of the red arrows. [sent-76, score-0.486]
</p><p>47 Conversely, the blue arrow passes through a highly extrinsically curved region that corresponds to a boundary between two manifolds. [sent-77, score-0.152]
</p><p>48 Here, the diffusivity should be weak in the direction of the blue arrow. [sent-78, score-0.474]

</p><p>51 In particular, diffusivity is the same at every point in the surface and in R2. [sent-85, score-0.461]
</p><p>52 2 shows the results of our preliminary pattern classification experiment, where the directions of estimated high curvature are often perpendicular to the directions of class decision boundaries. [sent-88, score-0.547]
</p><p>53 This supports the idea of controlling diffusivity based on the direction and strength of both intrinsic and extrinsic curvature. [sent-89, score-0.796]
</p><p>54 To build upon this, we next discuss a procedure which estimates the extrinsic and intrinsic curvature and, with it, develops a practical regularization operator on a manifold. [sent-90, score-0.839]

</p><p>59 Estimated high curvature directions are often perpendicular to decision boundary directions: First two columns: the directions are strongly inversely correlated. [sent-100, score-0.547]

We introduce the perimeters on graph using difference operators and define the curvature as the first variation of these perimeters.

<p>Author: Carl Olsson, Johannes Ulén, Yuri Boykov, Vladimir Kolmogorov</p><p>Abstract: Energies with high-order non-submodular interactions have been shown to be very useful in vision due to their high modeling power. Optimization of such energies, however, is generally NP-hard. A naive approach that works for small problem instances is exhaustive search, that is, enumeration of all possible labelings of the underlying graph. We propose a general minimization approach for large graphs based on enumeration of labelings of certain small patches. This partial enumeration technique reduces complex highorder energy formulations to pairwise Constraint Satisfaction Problems with unary costs (uCSP), which can be efficiently solved using standard methods like TRW-S. Our approach outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art algorithms on well known difficult problems (e.g. curvature regularization, stereo, deconvolution); it gives near global minimum and better speed. Our main application of interest is curvature regularization. In the context of segmentation, our partial enumeration technique allows to evaluate curvature directly on small patches using a novel integral geometry approach. 1</p><p>4 0.19977081 <a title="100-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Shortest_Paths_with_Curvature_and_Torsion.html">389 iccv-2013-Shortest Paths with Curvature and Torsion</a></p>
<p>Author: Petter Strandmark, Johannes Ulén, Fredrik Kahl, Leo Grady</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a method of finding thin, elongated structures in images and volumes. We use shortest paths to minimize very general functionals of higher-order curve properties, such as curvature and torsion. Our globally optimal method uses line graphs and its runtime is polynomial in the size of the discretization, often in the order of seconds on a single computer. To our knowledge, we are the first to perform experiments in three dimensions with curvature and torsion regularization. The largest graphs we process have almost one hundred billion arcs. Experiments on medical images and in multi-view reconstruction show the significance and practical usefulness of regularization based on curvature while torsion is still only tractable for small-scale problems.</p><p>5 0.14247285 <a title="100-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Total_Variation_Regularization_for_Functions_with_Values_in_a_Manifold.html">421 iccv-2013-Total Variation Regularization for Functions with Values in a Manifold</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan Lellmann, Evgeny Strekalovskiy, Sabrina Koetter, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: While total variation is among the most popular regularizers for variational problems, its extension to functions with values in a manifold is an open problem. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to solve such problems which applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. The key idea is to reformulate the variational problem as a multilabel optimization problem with an infinite number of labels. This leads to a hard optimization problem which can be approximately solved using convex relaxation techniques. The framework can be easily adapted to different manifolds including spheres and three-dimensional rotations, and allows to obtain accurate solutions even with a relatively coarse discretization. With numerous examples we demonstrate that the proposed framework can be applied to variational models that incorporate chromaticity values, normal fields, or camera trajectories.</p><p>6 0.12512368 <a title="100-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Label_Propagation_for_Semi-supervised_Multi-class_Multi-label_Classification.html">126 iccv-2013-Dynamic Label Propagation for Semi-supervised Multi-class Multi-label Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Kwang In Kim, James Tompkin, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: One fundamental assumption in object recognition as well as in other computer vision and pattern recognition problems is that the data generation process lies on a manifold and that it respects the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. This assumption is held in several successful algorithms for diffusion and regularization, in particular, in graph-Laplacian-based algorithms. We claim that the performance of existing algorithms can be improved if we additionally account for how the manifold is embedded within the ambient space, i.e., if we consider the extrinsic geometry of the manifold. We present a procedure for characterizing the extrinsic (as well as intrinsic) curvature of a manifold M which is described by a sampled point cloud in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Once estimated, we use this characterization in general diffusion and regularization on M, and form a new regularizer on a point cloud. The resulting re-weighted graph Laplacian demonstrates superior performance over classical graph Laplacian in semisupervised learning and spectral clustering.</p><p>2 0.81685108 <a title="100-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-On_the_Mean_Curvature_Flow_on_Graphs_with_Applications_in_Image_and_Manifold_Processing.html">296 iccv-2013-On the Mean Curvature Flow on Graphs with Applications in Image and Manifold Processing</a></p>
<p>Author: Abdallah El_Chakik, Abderrahim Elmoataz, Ahcene Sadi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptation and transcription of the mean curvature level set equation on a general discrete domain (weighted graphs with arbitrary topology). We introduce the perimeters on graph using difference operators and define the curvature as the first variation of these perimeters. Our proposed approach of mean curvature unifies both local and non local notions of mean curvature on Euclidean domains. Furthermore, it allows the extension to the processing of manifolds and data which can be represented by graphs.</p><p>3 0.77084851 <a title="100-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Shortest_Paths_with_Curvature_and_Torsion.html">389 iccv-2013-Shortest Paths with Curvature and Torsion</a></p>
<p>Author: Petter Strandmark, Johannes Ulén, Fredrik Kahl, Leo Grady</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a method of finding thin, elongated structures in images and volumes. We use shortest paths to minimize very general functionals of higher-order curve properties, such as curvature and torsion. Our globally optimal method uses line graphs and its runtime is polynomial in the size of the discretization, often in the order of seconds on a single computer. To our knowledge, we are the first to perform experiments in three dimensions with curvature and torsion regularization. The largest graphs we process have almost one hundred billion arcs. Experiments on medical images and in multi-view reconstruction show the significance and practical usefulness of regularization based on curvature while torsion is still only tractable for small-scale problems.</p><p>4 0.70855117 <a title="100-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Partial_Enumeration_and_Curvature_Regularization.html">309 iccv-2013-Partial Enumeration and Curvature Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Olsson, Johannes Ulén, Yuri Boykov, Vladimir Kolmogorov</p><p>Abstract: Energies with high-order non-submodular interactions have been shown to be very useful in vision due to their high modeling power. Optimization of such energies, however, is generally NP-hard. A naive approach that works for small problem instances is exhaustive search, that is, enumeration of all possible labelings of the underlying graph. We propose a general minimization approach for large graphs based on enumeration of labelings of certain small patches. This partial enumeration technique reduces complex highorder energy formulations to pairwise Constraint Satisfaction Problems with unary costs (uCSP), which can be efficiently solved using standard methods like TRW-S. Our approach outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art algorithms on well known difficult problems (e.g. curvature regularization, stereo, deconvolution); it gives near global minimum and better speed. Our main application of interest is curvature regularization. In the context of segmentation, our partial enumeration technique allows to evaluate curvature directly on small patches using a novel integral geometry approach. 1</p><p>5 0.60861105 <a title="100-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Total_Variation_Regularization_for_Functions_with_Values_in_a_Manifold.html">421 iccv-2013-Total Variation Regularization for Functions with Values in a Manifold</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan Lellmann, Evgeny Strekalovskiy, Sabrina Koetter, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: While total variation is among the most popular regularizers for variational problems, its extension to functions with values in a manifold is an open problem. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to solve such problems which applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. The key idea is to reformulate the variational problem as a multilabel optimization problem with an infinite number of labels. This leads to a hard optimization problem which can be approximately solved using convex relaxation techniques. The framework can be easily adapted to different manifolds including spheres and three-dimensional rotations, and allows to obtain accurate solutions even with a relatively coarse discretization. With numerous examples we demonstrate that the proposed framework can be applied to variational models that incorporate chromaticity values, normal fields, or camera trajectories.</p><p>6 0.44638568 <a title="100-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Multiview_Photometric_Stereo_Using_Planar_Mesh_Parameterization.html">284 iccv-2013-Multiview Photometric Stereo Using Planar Mesh Parameterization</a></p>

<p>Author: Juan Liu, Emmanouil Psarakis, Ioannis Stamos</p><p>Abstract: Repeated patterns (such as windows, tiles, balconies and doors) are prominent and significant features in urban scenes. Therefore, detection of these repeated patterns becomes very important for city scene analysis. This paper attacks the problem of repeated patterns detection in a precise, efficient and automatic way, by combining traditional feature extraction followed by a Kronecker product lowrank modeling approach. Our method is tailored for 2D images of building fac ¸ades. We have developed algorithms for automatic selection ofa representative texture withinfa ¸cade images using vanishing points and Harris corners. After rectifying the input images, we describe novel algorithms that extract repeated patterns by using Kronecker product based modeling that is based on a solid theoretical foundation. Our approach is unique and has not ever been used for fac ¸ade analysis. We have tested our algorithms in a large set of images.</p><p>3 0.7592181 <a title="100-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Sparse_Variation_Dictionary_Learning_for_Face_Recognition_with_a_Single_Training_Sample_per_Person.html">398 iccv-2013-Sparse Variation Dictionary Learning for Face Recognition with a Single Training Sample per Person</a></p>
<p>Author: Meng Yang, Luc Van_Gool, Lei Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Face recognition (FR) with a single training sample per person (STSPP) is a very challenging problem due to the lack of information to predict the variations in the query sample. Sparse representation based classification has shown interesting results in robust FR; however, its performance will deteriorate much for FR with STSPP. To address this issue, in this paper we learn a sparse variation dictionary from a generic training set to improve the query sample representation by STSPP. Instead of learning from the generic training set independently w.r.t. the gallery set, the proposed sparse variation dictionary learning (SVDL) method is adaptive to the gallery set by jointly learning a projection to connect the generic training set with the gallery set. The learnt sparse variation dictionary can be easily integrated into the framework of sparse representation based classification so that various variations in face images, including illumination, expression, occlusion, pose, etc., can be better handled. Experiments on the large-scale CMU Multi-PIE, FRGC and LFW databases demonstrate the promising performance of SVDL on FR with STSPP.</p><p>4 0.73874855 <a title="100-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Pose-Free_Facial_Landmark_Fitting_via_Optimized_Part_Mixtures_and_Cascaded_Deformable_Shape_Model.html">321 iccv-2013-Pose-Free Facial Landmark Fitting via Optimized Part Mixtures and Cascaded Deformable Shape Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiang Yu, Junzhou Huang, Shaoting Zhang, Wang Yan, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of facial landmark localization and tracking from a single camera. We present a two-stage cascaded deformable shape model to effectively and efficiently localize facial landmarks with large head pose variations. For face detection, we propose a group sparse learning method to automatically select the most salient facial landmarks. By introducing 3D face shape model, we use procrustes analysis to achieve pose-free facial landmark initialization. For deformation, the first step uses mean-shift local search with constrained local model to rapidly approach the global optimum. The second step uses component-wise active contours to discriminatively refine the subtle shape variation. Our framework can simultaneously handle face detection, pose-free landmark localization and tracking in real time. Extensive experiments are conducted on both laboratory environmental face databases and face-in-the-wild databases. All results demonstrate that our approach has certain advantages over state-of-theart methods in handling pose variations1.</p><p>5 0.7349425 <a title="100-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Space-Time_Tradeoffs_in_Photo_Sequencing.html">397 iccv-2013-Space-Time Tradeoffs in Photo Sequencing</a></p>
<p>Author: Tali Dekel_(Basha), Yael Moses, Shai Avidan</p><p>Abstract: Photo-sequencing is the problem of recovering the temporal order of a set of still images of a dynamic event, taken asynchronously by a set of uncalibrated cameras. Solving this problem is a first, crucial step for analyzing (or visualizing) the dynamic content of the scene captured by a large number of freely moving spectators. We propose a geometric based solution, followed by rank aggregation to . ac . i l avidan@ eng .t au . ac . i l the photo-sequencing problem. Our algorithm trades spatial certainty for temporal certainty. Whereas the previous solution proposed by [4] relies on two images taken from the same static camera to eliminate uncertainty in space, we drop the static-camera assumption and replace it with temporal information available from images taken from the same (moving) camera. Our method thus overcomes the limitation of the static-camera assumption, and scales much better with the duration of the event and the spread of cameras in space.

<p>Author: Mehrtash Harandi, Conrad Sanderson, Chunhua Shen, Brian Lovell</p><p>Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning suggest that a wide range of problems can be addressed more appropriately by considering non-Euclidean geometry. In this paper we explore sparse dictionary learning over the space of linear subspaces, which form Riemannian structures known as Grassmann manifolds. To this end, we propose to embed Grassmann manifolds into the space of symmetric matrices by an isometric mapping, which enables us to devise a closed-form solution for updating a Grassmann dictionary, atom by atom. Furthermore, to handle non-linearity in data, we propose a kernelised version of the dictionary learning algorithm. Experiments on several classification tasks (face recognition, action recognition, dynamic texture classification) show that the proposed approach achieves considerable improvements in discrimination accuracy, in comparison to state-of-the-art methods such as kernelised Affine Hull Method and graphembedding Grassmann discriminant analysis.</p><p>3 0.16599004 <a title="100-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Dynamic_Label_Propagation_for_Semi-supervised_Multi-class_Multi-label_Classification.html">126 iccv-2013-Dynamic Label Propagation for Semi-supervised Multi-class Multi-label Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Wang, Zhuowen Tu, John K. Tsotsos</p><p>Abstract: In graph-based semi-supervised learning approaches, the classification rate is highly dependent on the size of the availabel labeled data, as well as the accuracy of the similarity measures. Here, we propose a semi-supervised multi-class/multi-label classification scheme, dynamic label propagation (DLP), which performs transductive learning through propagation in a dynamic process. Existing semi-supervised classification methods often have difficulty in dealing with multi-class/multi-label problems due to the lack in consideration of label correlation; our algorithm instead emphasizes dynamic metric fusion with label information. Significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods is observed on benchmark datasets for both multiclass and multi-label tasks.</p><p>4 0.14996827 <a title="100-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Manifold_Based_Face_Synthesis_from_Sparse_Samples.html">259 iccv-2013-Manifold Based Face Synthesis from Sparse Samples</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongteng Xu, Hongyuan Zha</p><p>Abstract: Data sparsity has been a thorny issuefor manifold-based image synthesis, and in this paper we address this critical problem by leveraging ideas from transfer learning. Specifically, we propose methods based on generating auxiliary data in the form of synthetic samples using transformations of the original sparse samples. To incorporate the auxiliary data, we propose a weighted data synthesis method, which adaptively selects from the generated samples for inclusion during the manifold learning process via a weighted iterative algorithm. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we apply it to the problem of face image synthesis from sparse samples. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method shows encouraging results with good performance improvements.</p><p>5 0.14217685 <a title="100-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Framework_for_Shape_Analysis_via_Hilbert_Space_Embedding.html">10 iccv-2013-A Framework for Shape Analysis via Hilbert Space Embedding</a></p>
<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for 2D shape analysis using positive definite kernels defined on Kendall’s shape manifold. Different representations of 2D shapes are known to generate different nonlinear spaces. Due to the nonlinearity of these spaces, most existing shape classification algorithms resort to nearest neighbor methods and to learning distances on shape spaces. Here, we propose to map shapes on Kendall’s shape manifold to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To this end, we introduce a kernel on this manifold that permits such a mapping, and prove its positive definiteness. This kernel lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM, MKL and kernel PCA, to the shape manifold. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods on shape classification, clustering and retrieval.</p><p>6 0.13051969 <a title="100-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Total_Variation_Regularization_for_Functions_with_Values_in_a_Manifold.html">421 iccv-2013-Total Variation Regularization for Functions with Values in a Manifold</a></p>

<p>Author: Jan Lellmann, Evgeny Strekalovskiy, Sabrina Koetter, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: While total variation is among the most popular regularizers for variational problems, its extension to functions with values in a manifold is an open problem. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to solve such problems which applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. The key idea is to reformulate the variational problem as a multilabel optimization problem with an infinite number of labels. This leads to a hard optimization problem which can be approximately solved using convex relaxation techniques. The framework can be easily adapted to different manifolds including spheres and three-dimensional rotations, and allows to obtain accurate solutions even with a relatively coarse discretization. With numerous examples we demonstrate that the proposed framework can be applied to variational models that incorporate chromaticity values, normal fields, or camera trajectories.</p><p>4 0.70841229 <a title="100-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Manifold_Based_Face_Synthesis_from_Sparse_Samples.html">259 iccv-2013-Manifold Based Face Synthesis from Sparse Samples</a></p>

<p>Author: Kim Steenstrup Pedersen, Kristoffer Stensbo-Smidt, Andrew Zirm, Christian Igel</p><p>Abstract: A texture descriptor based on the shape index and the accompanying curvedness measure is proposed, and it is evaluated for the automated analysis of astronomical image data. A representative sample of images of low-redshift galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) serves as a testbed. The goal of applying texture descriptors to these data is to extract novel information about galaxies; information which is often lost in more traditional analysis. In this study, we build a regression model for predicting a spectroscopic quantity, the specific star-formation rate (sSFR). As texture features we consider multi-scale gradient orientation histograms as well as multi-scale shape index histograms, which lead to a new descriptor. Our results show that we can successfully predict spectroscopic quantities from the texture in optical multi-band images. We successfully recover the observed bi-modal distribution of galaxies into quiescent and star-forming. The state-ofthe-art for predicting the sSFR is a color-based physical model. We significantly improve its accuracy by augmenting the model with texture information. This study is thefirst step towards enabling the quantification of physical galaxy properties from imaging data alone.</p><p>3 0.59565699 <a title="100-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Elastic_Net_Constraints_for_Shape_Matching.html">140 iccv-2013-Elastic Net Constraints for Shape Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuele Rodolà, Andrea Torsello, Tatsuya Harada, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We consider a parametrized relaxation of the widely adopted quadratic assignment problem (QAP) formulation for minimum distortion correspondence between deformable shapes. In order to control the accuracy/sparsity trade-off we introduce a weighting parameter on the combination of two existing relaxations, namely spectral and game-theoretic. This leads to the introduction of the elastic net penalty function into shape matching problems. In combination with an efficient algorithm to project onto the elastic net ball, we obtain an approach for deformable shape matching with controllable sparsity. Experiments on a standard benchmark confirm the effectiveness of the approach.</p><p>4 0.58695298 <a title="100-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-SUN3D%3A_A_Database_of_Big_Spaces_Reconstructed_Using_SfM_and_Object_Labels.html">367 iccv-2013-SUN3D: A Database of Big Spaces Reconstructed Using SfM and Object Labels</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxiong Xiao, Andrew Owens, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: Existing scene understanding datasets contain only a limited set of views of a place, and they lack representations of complete 3D spaces. In this paper, we introduce SUN3D, a large-scale RGB-D video database with camera pose and object labels, capturing the full 3D extent of many places. The tasks that go into constructing such a dataset are difficult in isolation hand-labeling videos is painstaking, and structure from motion (SfM) is unreliable for large spaces. But if we combine them together, we make the dataset construction task much easier. First, we introduce an intuitive labeling tool that uses a partial reconstruction to propagate labels from one frame to another. Then we use the object labels to fix errors in the reconstruction. For this, we introduce a generalization of bundle adjustment that incorporates object-to-object correspondences. This algorithm works by constraining points for the same object from different frames to lie inside a fixed-size bounding box, parameterized by its rotation and translation. The SUN3D database, the source code for the generalized bundle adjustment, and the web-based 3D annotation tool are all avail– able at http://sun3d.cs.princeton.edu.</p><p>5 0.57016248 <a title="100-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Correntropy_Induced_L2_Graph_for_Robust_Subspace_Clustering.html">94 iccv-2013-Correntropy Induced L2 Graph for Robust Subspace Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jinhui Tang, Min Lin, Liang Lin, Shuicheng Yan, Zhouchen Lin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the robust subspace clustering problem, which aims to cluster the given possibly noisy data points into their underlying subspaces. A large pool of previous subspace clustering methods focus on the graph construction by different regularization of the representation coefficient. We instead focus on the robustness of the model to non-Gaussian noises. We propose a new robust clustering method by using the correntropy induced metric, which is robust for handling the non-Gaussian and impulsive noises. Also we further extend the method for handling the data with outlier rows/features. The multiplicative form of half-quadratic optimization is used to optimize the nonconvex correntropy objective function of the proposed models. Extensive experiments on face datasets well demonstrate that the proposed methods are more robust to corruptions and occlusions.</p><p>6 0.47175145 <a title="100-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Dictionary_Learning_and_Sparse_Coding_on_Grassmann_Manifolds%3A_An_Extrinsic_Solution.html">114 iccv-2013-Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding on Grassmann Manifolds: An Extrinsic Solution</a></p>

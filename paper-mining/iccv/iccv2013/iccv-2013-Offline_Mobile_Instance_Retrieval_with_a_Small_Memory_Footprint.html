<p>Author: Anand Mishra, Karteek Alahari, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach for the text-to-image retrieval problem based on textual content present in images. Given the recent developments in understanding text in images, an appealing approach to address this problem is to localize and recognize the text, and then query the database, as in a text retrieval problem. We show that such an approach, despite being based on state-of-the-artmethods, is insufficient, and propose a method, where we do not rely on an exact localization and recognition pipeline. We take a query-driven search approach, where we find approximate locations of characters in the text query, and then impose spatial constraints to generate a ranked list of images in the database. The retrieval performance is evaluated on public scene text datasets as well as three large datasets, namely IIIT scene text retrieval, Sports-10K and TV series-1M, we introduce.</p><p>4 0.22150889 <a title="294-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Mining_Motion_Atoms_and_Phrases_for_Complex_Action_Recognition.html">265 iccv-2013-Mining Motion Atoms and Phrases for Complex Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Limin Wang, Yu Qiao, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes motion atom and phrase as a midlevel temporal “part” for representing and classifying complex action. Motion atom is defined as an atomic part of action, and captures the motion information of action video in a short temporal scale. Motion phrase is a temporal composite of multiple motion atoms with an AND/OR structure, which further enhances the discriminative ability of motion atoms by incorporating temporal constraints in a longer scale. Specifically, given a set of weakly labeled action videos, we firstly design a discriminative clustering method to automatically discovera set ofrepresentative motion atoms. Then, based on these motion atoms, we mine effective motion phrases with high discriminative and representativepower. We introduce a bottom-upphrase construction algorithm and a greedy selection method for this mining task. We examine the classification performance of the motion atom and phrase based representation on two complex action datasets: Olympic Sports and UCF50. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance over recent published methods on both datasets.</p><p>5 0.19376355 <a title="294-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Mining_Multiple_Queries_for_Image_Retrieval%3A_On-the-Fly_Learning_of_an_Object-Specific_Mid-level_Representation.html">266 iccv-2013-Mining Multiple Queries for Image Retrieval: On-the-Fly Learning of an Object-Specific Mid-level Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Basura Fernando, Tinne Tuytelaars</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a new method for object retrieval starting from multiple query images. The use of multiple queries allows for a more expressive formulation of the query object including, e.g., different viewpoints and/or viewing conditions. This, in turn, leads to more diverse and more accurate retrieval results. When no query images are available to the user, they can easily be retrieved from the internet using a standard image search engine. In particular, we propose a new method based on pattern mining. Using the minimal description length principle, we derive the most suitable set of patterns to describe the query object, with patterns corresponding to local feature configurations. This results in apowerful object-specific mid-level image representation. The archive can then be searched efficiently for similar images based on this representation, using a combination of two inverted file systems. Since the patterns already encode local spatial information, good results on several standard image retrieval datasets are obtained even without costly re-ranking based on geometric verification.</p><p>6 0.15898882 <a title="294-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Grids%3A_Fast_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbors_and_Range_Searching_for_Image_Search.html">337 iccv-2013-Random Grids: Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbors and Range Searching for Image Search</a></p>

<p>Author: Yan Xia, Kaiming He, Fang Wen, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: Inverted indexing is a popular non-exhaustive solution to large scale search. An inverted file is built by a quantizer such as k-means or a tree structure. It has been found that multiple inverted files, obtained by multiple independent random quantizers, are able to achieve practically good recall and speed. Instead of computing the multiple quantizers independently, we present a method that creates them jointly. Our method jointly optimizes all codewords in all quantizers. Then it assigns these codewords to the quantizers. In experiments this method shows significant improvement over various existing methods that use multiple independent quantizers. On the one-billion set of SIFT vectors, our method is faster and more accurate than a recent state-of-the-art inverted indexing method.</p><p>4 0.7483837 <a title="294-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Quantize_and_Conquer%3A_A_Dimensionality-Recursive_Solution_to_Clustering%2C_Vector_Quantization%2C_and_Image_Retrieval.html">333 iccv-2013-Quantize and Conquer: A Dimensionality-Recursive Solution to Clustering, Vector Quantization, and Image Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Yannis Avrithis</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by the close relation between nearest neighbor search and clustering in high-dimensional spaces as well as the success of one helping to solve the other, we introduce a new paradigm where both problems are solved simultaneously. Our solution is recursive, not in the size of input data but in the number of dimensions. One result is a clustering algorithm that is tuned to small codebooks but does not need all data in memory at the same time and is practically constant in the data size. As a by-product, a tree structure performs either exact or approximate quantization on trained centroids, the latter being not very precise but extremely fast. A lesser contribution is a new indexing scheme for image retrieval that exploits multiple small codebooks to provide an arbitrarily fine partition of the descriptor space. Large scale experiments on public datasets exhibit state of the art performance and remarkable generalization.</p><p>5 0.73928648 <a title="294-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Query-Adaptive_Asymmetrical_Dissimilarities_for_Visual_Object_Retrieval.html">334 iccv-2013-Query-Adaptive Asymmetrical Dissimilarities for Visual Object Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Cai-Zhi Zhu, Hervé Jégou, Shin'Ichi Satoh</p><p>Abstract: Visual object retrieval aims at retrieving, from a collection of images, all those in which a given query object appears. It is inherently asymmetric: the query object is mostly included in the database image, while the converse is not necessarily true. However, existing approaches mostly compare the images with symmetrical measures, without considering the different roles of query and database. This paper first measure the extent of asymmetry on large-scale public datasets reflecting this task. Considering the standard bag-of-words representation, we then propose new asymmetrical dissimilarities accounting for the different inlier ratios associated with query and database images. These asymmetrical measures depend on the query, yet they are compatible with an inverted file structure, without noticeably impacting search efficiency. Our experiments show the benefit of our approach, and show that the visual object retrieval task is better treated asymmetrically, in the spirit of state-of-the-art text retrieval.</p><p>6 0.729792 <a title="294-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Neighborhood_Graph_Search_Using_Cartesian_Concatenation.html">159 iccv-2013-Fast Neighborhood Graph Search Using Cartesian Concatenation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jayaguru Panda, Michael S. Brown, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: Existing mobile image instance retrieval applications assume a network-based usage where image features are sent to a server to query an online visual database. In this scenario, there are no restrictions on the size of the visual database. This paper, however, examines how to perform this same task offline, where the entire visual index must reside on the mobile device itself within a small memory footprint. Such solutions have applications on location recognition and product recognition. Mobile instance retrieval requires a significant reduction in the visual index size. To achieve this, we describe a set of strategies that can reduce the visual index up to 60-80 compared to a scatannd raerddu iens tthaen vceis rueatrli ienvdaelx xim upple tom 6en0t-8at0io ×n found on ddte osk atops or servers. While our proposed reduction steps affect the overall mean Average Precision (mAP), they are able to maintain a good Precision for the top K results (PK). We argue that for such offline application, maintaining a good PK is sufficient. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on several standard databases. A working application designed for a remote historical site is also presented. This application is able to reduce an 50,000 image index structure to 25 MBs while providing a precision of 97% for P10 and 100% for P1.</p><p>2 0.73712391 <a title="294-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Tucker_Tensor_Decomposition_for_Effective_Image_Representation.html">362 iccv-2013-Robust Tucker Tensor Decomposition for Effective Image Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Miao Zhang, Chris Ding</p><p>Abstract: Many tensor based algorithms have been proposed for the study of high dimensional data in a large variety ofcomputer vision and machine learning applications. However, most of the existing tensor analysis approaches are based on Frobenius norm, which makes them sensitive to outliers, because they minimize the sum of squared errors and enlarge the influence of both outliers and large feature noises. In this paper, we propose a robust Tucker tensor decomposition model (RTD) to suppress the influence of outliers, which uses L1-norm loss function. Yet, the optimization on L1-norm based tensor analysis is much harder than standard tensor decomposition. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to solve our RTD model. Moreover, tensor factorization-based image storage needs much less space than PCA based methods. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithm, and verify the robustness against image occlusions. Both numerical and visual results show that our RTD model is consistently better against the existence of outliers than previous tensor and PCA methods.</p><p>3 0.6977005 <a title="294-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Normal_Field_Integration_for_3D_Reconstruction_of_Mirroring_Objects.html">281 iccv-2013-Multi-view Normal Field Integration for 3D Reconstruction of Mirroring Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Weinmann, Aljosa Osep, Roland Ruiters, Reinhard Klein</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel, robust multi-view normal field integration technique for reconstructing the full 3D shape of mirroring objects. We employ a turntablebased setup with several cameras and displays. These are used to display illumination patterns which are reflected by the object surface. The pattern information observed in the cameras enables the calculation of individual volumetric normal fields for each combination of camera, display and turntable angle. As the pattern information might be blurred depending on the surface curvature or due to nonperfect mirroring surface characteristics, we locally adapt the decoding to the finest still resolvable pattern resolution. In complex real-world scenarios, the normal fields contain regions without observations due to occlusions and outliers due to interreflections and noise. Therefore, a robust reconstruction using only normal information is challenging. Via a non-parametric clustering of normal hypotheses derived for each point in the scene, we obtain both the most likely local surface normal and a local surface consistency estimate. This information is utilized in an iterative mincut based variational approach to reconstruct the surface geometry.</p><p>4 0.6961444 <a title="294-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_Max-Margin_Perspective_on_Sparse_Representation-Based_Classification.html">20 iccv-2013-A Max-Margin Perspective on Sparse Representation-Based Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhaowen Wang, Jianchao Yang, Nasser Nasrabadi, Thomas Huang</p><p>Abstract: Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) is a powerful tool in distinguishing signal categories which lie on different subspaces. Despite its wide application to visual recognition tasks, current understanding of SRC is solely based on a reconstructive perspective, which neither offers any guarantee on its classification performance nor provides any insight on how to design a discriminative dictionary for SRC. In this paper, we present a novel perspective towards SRC and interpret it as a margin classifier. The decision boundary and margin of SRC are analyzed in local regions where the support of sparse code is stable. Based on the derived margin, we propose a hinge loss function as the gauge for the classification performance of SRC. A stochastic gradient descent algorithm is implemented to maximize the margin of SRC and obtain more discriminative dictionaries. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting classification performance and improving dictionary quality over reconstructive ones. Classification results competitive with other state-ofthe-art sparse coding methods are reported on several data sets.</p><p>5 0.69558501 <a title="294-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Scene_Text_Localization_and_Recognition_with_Oriented_Stroke_Detection.html">376 iccv-2013-Scene Text Localization and Recognition with Oriented Stroke Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Lukáš Neumann, Jiri Matas</p><p>Abstract: An unconstrained end-to-end text localization and recognition method is presented. The method introduces a novel approach for character detection and recognition which combines the advantages of sliding-window and connected component methods. Characters are detected and recognized as image regions which contain strokes of specific orientations in a specific relative position, where the strokes are efficiently detected by convolving the image gradient field with a set of oriented bar filters. Additionally, a novel character representation efficiently calculated from the values obtained in the stroke detection phase is introduced. The representation is robust to shift at the stroke level, which makes it less sensitive to intra-class variations and the noise induced by normalizing character size and positioning. The effectiveness of the representation is demonstrated by the results achieved in the classification of real-world characters using an euclidian nearestneighbor classifier trained on synthetic data in a plain form. The method was evaluated on a standard dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition.</p><p>6 0.69060433 <a title="294-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Class-Specific_Simplex-Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_for_Image_Classification.html">73 iccv-2013-Class-Specific Simplex-Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Image Classification</a></p>

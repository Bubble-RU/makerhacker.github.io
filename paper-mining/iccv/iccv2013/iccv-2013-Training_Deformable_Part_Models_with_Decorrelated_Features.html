<p>Author: Ning Zhang, Ryan Farrell, Forrest Iandola, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing objects in fine-grained domains can be extremely challenging due to the subtle differences between subcategories. Discriminative markings are often highly localized, leading traditional object recognition approaches to struggle with the large pose variation often present in these domains. Pose-normalization seeks to align training exemplars, either piecewise by part or globally for the whole object, effectively factoring out differences in pose and in viewing angle. Prior approaches relied on computationally-expensive filter ensembles for part localization and required extensive supervision. This paper proposes two pose-normalized descriptors based on computationally-efficient deformable part models. The first leverages the semantics inherent in strongly-supervised DPM parts. The second exploits weak semantic annotations to learn cross-component correspondences, computing pose-normalized descriptors from the latent parts of a weakly-supervised DPM. These representations enable pooling across pose and viewpoint, in turn facilitating tasks such as fine-grained recognition and attribute prediction. Experiments conducted on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset and Berkeley Human Attribute dataset demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-art algorithms.</p><p>3 0.16231084 <a title="426-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Detecting_Dynamic_Objects_with_Multi-view_Background_Subtraction.html">111 iccv-2013-Detecting Dynamic Objects with Multi-view Background Subtraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Raúl Díaz, Sam Hallman, Charless C. Fowlkes</p><p>Abstract: The confluence of robust algorithms for structure from motion along with high-coverage mapping and imaging of the world around us suggests that it will soon be feasible to accurately estimate camera pose for a large class photographs taken in outdoor, urban environments. In this paper, we investigate how such information can be used to improve the detection of dynamic objects such as pedestrians and cars. First, we show that when rough camera location is known, we can utilize detectors that have been trained with a scene-specific background model in order to improve detection accuracy. Second, when precise camera pose is available, dense matching to a database of existing images using multi-view stereo provides a way to eliminate static backgrounds such as building facades, akin to background-subtraction often used in video analysis. We evaluate these ideas using a dataset of tourist photos with estimated camera pose. For template-based pedestrian detection, we achieve a 50 percent boost in average precision over baseline.</p><p>4 0.16093263 <a title="426-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Class-Specific_Simplex-Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_for_Image_Classification.html">73 iccv-2013-Class-Specific Simplex-Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Mandar Dixit, Nikhil Rasiwasia, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: An extension of the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), denoted class-specific-simplex LDA (css-LDA), is proposed for image classification. An analysis of the supervised LDA models currently used for this task shows that the impact of class information on the topics discovered by these models is very weak in general. This implies that the discovered topics are driven by general image regularities, rather than the semantic regularities of interest for classification. To address this, we introduce a model that induces supervision in topic discovery, while retaining the original flexibility of LDA to account for unanticipated structures of interest. The proposed css-LDA is an LDA model with class supervision at the level of image features. In css-LDA topics are discovered per class, i.e. a single set of topics shared across classes is replaced by multiple class-specific topic sets. This model can be used for generative classification using the Bayes decision rule or even extended to discriminative classification with support vector machines (SVMs). A css-LDA model can endow an image with a vector of class and topic specific count statistics that are similar to the Bag-of-words (BoW) histogram. SVM-based discriminants can be learned for classes in the space of these histograms. The effectiveness of css-LDA model in both generative and discriminative classification frameworks is demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation, involving multiple benchmark datasets, where it is shown to outperform all existing LDA based image classification approaches.</p><p>5 0.15033934 <a title="426-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Group_Norm_for_Learning_Structured_SVMs_with_Unstructured_Latent_Variables.html">187 iccv-2013-Group Norm for Learning Structured SVMs with Unstructured Latent Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Daozheng Chen, Dhruv Batra, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: Latent variables models have been applied to a number of computer vision problems. However, the complexity of the latent space is typically left as a free design choice. A larger latent space results in a more expressive model, but such models are prone to overfitting and are slower to perform inference with. The goal of this paper is to regularize the complexity of the latent space and learn which hidden states are really relevant for prediction. Specifically, we propose using group-sparsity-inducing regularizers such as ?1-?2 to estimate the parameters of Structured SVMs with unstructured latent variables. Our experiments on digit recognition and object detection show that our approach is indeed able to control the complexity of latent space without any significant loss in accuracy of the learnt model.</p><p>6 0.14486009 <a title="426-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-HOGgles%3A_Visualizing_Object_Detection_Features.html">189 iccv-2013-HOGgles: Visualizing Object Detection Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Iasonas Kokkinos</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to identify and exploit structures that are shared across different object categories, by using sparse coding to learn a shared basis for the ‘part’ and ‘root’ templates of Deformable Part Models (DPMs). Our first contribution consists in using Shift-Invariant Sparse Coding (SISC) to learn mid-level elements that can translate during coding. This results in systematically better approximations than those attained using standard sparse coding. To emphasize that the learned mid-level structures are shiftable we call them shufflets. Our second contribution consists in using the resulting score to construct probabilistic upper bounds to the exact template scores, instead of taking them ‘at face value ’ as is common in current works. We integrate shufflets in DualTree Branch-and-Bound and cascade-DPMs and demonstrate that we can achieve a substantial acceleration, with practically no loss in performance.</p><p>3 0.78888702 <a title="426-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Regionlets_for_Generic_Object_Detection.html">349 iccv-2013-Regionlets for Generic Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoyu Wang, Ming Yang, Shenghuo Zhu, Yuanqing Lin</p><p>Abstract: Generic object detection is confronted by dealing with different degrees of variations in distinct object classes with tractable computations, which demands for descriptive and flexible object representations that are also efficient to evaluate for many locations. In view of this, we propose to model an object class by a cascaded boosting classifier which integrates various types of features from competing local regions, named as regionlets. A regionlet is a base feature extraction region defined proportionally to a detection window at an arbitrary resolution (i.e. size and aspect ratio). These regionlets are organized in small groups with stable relative positions to delineate fine-grained spatial layouts inside objects. Their features are aggregated to a one-dimensional feature within one group so as to tolerate deformations. Then we evaluate the object bounding box proposal in selective search from segmentation cues, limiting the evaluation locations to thousands. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on popular multi-class detection benchmark datasets with a single method, without any contexts. It achieves the detec- tion mean average precision of 41. 7% on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and 39. 7% on the VOC 2010 for 20 object categories. It achieves 14. 7% mean average precision on the ImageNet dataset for 200 object categories, outperforming the latest deformable part-based model (DPM) by 4. 7%.</p><p>4 0.74703074 <a title="426-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Group_Norm_for_Learning_Structured_SVMs_with_Unstructured_Latent_Variables.html">187 iccv-2013-Group Norm for Learning Structured SVMs with Unstructured Latent Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Zhiheng Huang, Alexander C. Berg, Li Fei-Fei</p><p>Abstract: The growth of detection datasets and the multiple directions of object detection research provide both an unprecedented need and a great opportunity for a thorough evaluation of the current state of the field of categorical object detection. In this paper we strive to answer two key questions. First, where are we currently as a field: what have we done right, what still needs to be improved? Second, where should we be going in designing the next generation of object detectors? Inspired by the recent work of Hoiem et al. [10] on the standard PASCAL VOC detection dataset, we perform a large-scale study on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) data. First, we quantitatively demonstrate that this dataset provides many of the same detection challenges as the PASCAL VOC. Due to its scale of 1000 object categories, ILSVRC also provides an excellent testbed for understanding the performance of detectors as a function of several key properties of the object classes. We conduct a series of analyses looking at how different detection methods perform on a number of imagelevel and object-class-levelproperties such as texture, color, deformation, and clutter. We learn important lessons of the current object detection methods and propose a number of insights for designing the next generation object detectors.</p><p>6 0.72674727 <a title="426-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Building_Part-Based_Object_Detectors_via_3D_Geometry.html">66 iccv-2013-Building Part-Based Object Detectors via 3D Geometry</a></p>

<p>Author: Qiegen Liu, Jianbo Liu, Pei Dong, Dong Liang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel structure gradient and texture decorrelating regularization (SGTD) for image decomposition. The motivation of the idea is under the assumption that the structure gradient and texture components should be properly decorrelated for a successful decomposition. The proposed model consists of the data fidelity term, total variation regularization and the SGTD regularization. An augmented Lagrangian method is proposed to address this optimization issue, by first transforming the unconstrained problem to an equivalent constrained problem and then applying an alternating direction method to iteratively solve the subproblems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method presents better or comparable performance as state-of-the-art methods do.</p><p>2 0.83282775 <a title="426-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Automatic_Kronecker_Product_Model_Based_Detection_of_Repeated_Patterns_in_2D_Urban_Images.html">55 iccv-2013-Automatic Kronecker Product Model Based Detection of Repeated Patterns in 2D Urban Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Juan Liu, Emmanouil Psarakis, Ioannis Stamos</p><p>Abstract: Repeated patterns (such as windows, tiles, balconies and doors) are prominent and significant features in urban scenes. Therefore, detection of these repeated patterns becomes very important for city scene analysis. This paper attacks the problem of repeated patterns detection in a precise, efficient and automatic way, by combining traditional feature extraction followed by a Kronecker product lowrank modeling approach. Our method is tailored for 2D images of building fac ¸ades. We have developed algorithms for automatic selection ofa representative texture withinfa ¸cade images using vanishing points and Harris corners. After rectifying the input images, we describe novel algorithms that extract repeated patterns by using Kronecker product based modeling that is based on a solid theoretical foundation. Our approach is unique and has not ever been used for fac ¸ade analysis. We have tested our algorithms in a large set of images.</p><p>3 0.80820644 <a title="426-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-From_Point_to_Set%3A_Extend_the_Learning_of_Distance_Metrics.html">177 iccv-2013-From Point to Set: Extend the Learning of Distance Metrics</a></p>
<p>Author: Pengfei Zhu, Lei Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Most of the current metric learning methods are proposed for point-to-point distance (PPD) based classification. In many computer vision tasks, however, we need to measure the point-to-set distance (PSD) and even set-to-set distance (SSD) for classification. In this paper, we extend the PPD based Mahalanobis distance metric learning to PSD and SSD based ones, namely point-to-set distance metric learning (PSDML) and set-to-set distance metric learning (SSDML), and solve them under a unified optimization framework. First, we generate positive and negative sample pairs by computing the PSD and SSD between training samples. Then, we characterize each sample pair by its covariance matrix, and propose a covariance kernel based discriminative function. Finally, we tackle the PSDML and SSDMLproblems by using standard support vector machine solvers, making the metric learning very efficient for multiclass visual classification tasks. Experiments on gender classification, digit recognition, object categorization and face recognition show that the proposed metric learning methods can effectively enhance the performance of PSD and SSD based classification.</p><p>4 0.78928131 <a title="426-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Active_Visual_Recognition_with_Expertise_Estimation_in_Crowdsourcing.html">43 iccv-2013-Active Visual Recognition with Expertise Estimation in Crowdsourcing</a></p>
<p>Author: Chengjiang Long, Gang Hua, Ashish Kapoor</p><p>Abstract: We present a noise resilient probabilistic model for active learning of a Gaussian process classifier from crowds, i.e., a set of noisy labelers. It explicitly models both the overall label noises and the expertise level of each individual labeler in two levels of flip models. Expectation propagation is adopted for efficient approximate Bayesian inference of our probabilistic model for classification, based on which, a generalized EM algorithm is derived to estimate both the global label noise and the expertise of each individual labeler. The probabilistic nature of our model immediately allows the adoption of the prediction entropy and estimated expertise for active selection of data sample to be labeled, and active selection of high quality labelers to label the data, respectively. We apply the proposed model for three visual recognition tasks, i.e, object category recognition, gender recognition, and multi-modal activity recognition, on three datasets with real crowd-sourced labels from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The experiments clearly demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed model.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.76960623 <a title="426-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Training_Deformable_Part_Models_with_Decorrelated_Features.html">426 iccv-2013-Training Deformable Part Models with Decorrelated Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Ross Girshick, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we show how to train a deformable part model (DPM) fast—typically in less than 20 minutes, or four times faster than the current fastest method—while maintaining high average precision on the PASCAL VOC datasets. At the core of our approach is “latent LDA,” a novel generalization of linear discriminant analysis for learning latent variable models. Unlike latent SVM, latent LDA uses efficient closed-form updates and does not require an expensive search for hard negative examples. Our approach also acts as a springboard for a detailed experimental study of DPM training. We isolate and quantify the impact of key training factors for the first time (e.g., How important are discriminative SVM filters? How important is joint parameter estimation? How many negative images are needed for training?). Our findings yield useful insights for researchers working with Markov random fields and partbased models, and have practical implications for speeding up tasks such as model selection.</p><p>6 0.76136458 <a title="426-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Modifying_the_Memorability_of_Face_Photographs.html">272 iccv-2013-Modifying the Memorability of Face Photographs</a></p>

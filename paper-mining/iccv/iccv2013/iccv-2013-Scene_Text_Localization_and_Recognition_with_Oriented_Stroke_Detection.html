<p>Author: Weilin Huang, Zhe Lin, Jianchao Yang, Jue Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new approach for text localization in natural images, by discriminating text and non-text regions at three levels: pixel, component and textline levels. Firstly, a powerful low-level filter called the Stroke Feature Transform (SFT) is proposed, which extends the widely-used Stroke Width Transform (SWT) by incorporating color cues of text pixels, leading to significantly enhanced performance on inter-component separation and intra-component connection. Secondly, based on the output of SFT, we apply two classifiers, a text component classifier and a text-line classifier, sequentially to extract text regions, eliminating the heuristic procedures that are commonly used in previous approaches. The two classifiers are built upon two novel Text Covariance Descriptors (TCDs) that encode both the heuristic properties and the statistical characteristics of text stokes. Finally, text regions are located by simply thresholding the text-line confident map. Our method was evaluated on two benchmark datasets: ICDAR 2005 and ICDAR 2011, and the corresponding F- , measure values are 0. 72 and 0. 73, respectively, surpassing previous methods in accuracy by a large margin.</p><p>3 0.24696918 <a title="376-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-PhotoOCR%3A_Reading_Text_in_Uncontrolled_Conditions.html">315 iccv-2013-PhotoOCR: Reading Text in Uncontrolled Conditions</a></p>
<p>Author: Alessandro Bissacco, Mark Cummins, Yuval Netzer, Hartmut Neven</p><p>Abstract: We describe PhotoOCR, a system for text extraction from images. Our particular focus is reliable text extraction from smartphone imagery, with the goal of text recognition as a user input modality similar to speech recognition. Commercially available OCR performs poorly on this task. Recent progress in machine learning has substantially improved isolated character classification; we build on this progress by demonstrating a complete OCR system using these techniques. We also incorporate modern datacenter-scale distributed language modelling. Our approach is capable of recognizing text in a variety of challenging imaging conditions where traditional OCR systems fail, notably in the presence of substantial blur, low resolution, low contrast, high image noise and other distortions. It also operates with low latency; mean processing time is 600 ms per image. We evaluate our system on public benchmark datasets for text extraction and outperform all previously reported results, more than halving the error rate on multiple benchmarks. The system is currently in use in many applications at Google, and is available as a user input modality in Google Translate for Android.</p><p>4 0.20713672 <a title="376-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Retrieval_Using_Textual_Cues.html">210 iccv-2013-Image Retrieval Using Textual Cues</a></p>
<p>Author: Anand Mishra, Karteek Alahari, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach for the text-to-image retrieval problem based on textual content present in images. Given the recent developments in understanding text in images, an appealing approach to address this problem is to localize and recognize the text, and then query the database, as in a text retrieval problem. We show that such an approach, despite being based on state-of-the-artmethods, is insufficient, and propose a method, where we do not rely on an exact localization and recognition pipeline. We take a query-driven search approach, where we find approximate locations of characters in the text query, and then impose spatial constraints to generate a ranked list of images in the database.

Unlike most existing works which assume that texts are horizontal and frontal parallel to the image plane, our method is able to recognize perspective texts of arbitrary orientations.

<p>Author: Claudia Nieuwenhuis, Evgeny Strekalovskiy, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a convex multilabel framework for image sequence segmentation which allows to impose proportion priors on object parts in order to preserve their size ratios across multiple images. The key idea is that for strongly deformable objects such as a gymnast the size ratio of respective regions (head versus torso, legs versus full body, etc.) is typically preserved. We propose different ways to impose such priors in a Bayesian framework for image segmentation. We show that near-optimal solutions can be computed using convex relaxation techniques. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proportion priors allow for highly accurate segmentations, avoiding seeping-out of regions and preserving semantically relevant small-scale structures such as hands or feet. They naturally apply to multiple object instances such as players in sports scenes, and they can relate different objects instead of object parts, e.g. organs in medical imaging. The algorithm is efficient and easily parallelized leading to proportion-consistent segmentations at runtimes around one second.</p><p>2 0.87918204 <a title="376-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Cross-Field_Joint_Image_Restoration_via_Scale_Map.html">98 iccv-2013-Cross-Field Joint Image Restoration via Scale Map</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiong Yan, Xiaoyong Shen, Li Xu, Shaojie Zhuo, Xiaopeng Zhang, Liang Shen, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: Color, infrared, and flash images captured in different fields can be employed to effectively eliminate noise and other visual artifacts. We propose a two-image restoration framework considering input images in different fields, for example, one noisy color image and one dark-flashed nearinfrared image. The major issue in such a framework is to handle structure divergence and find commonly usable edges and smooth transition for visually compelling image reconstruction. We introduce a scale map as a competent representation to explicitly model derivative-level confidence and propose new functions and a numerical solver to effectively infer it following new structural observations. Our method is general and shows a principled way for cross-field restoration.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.86222696 <a title="376-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Scene_Text_Localization_and_Recognition_with_Oriented_Stroke_Detection.html">376 iccv-2013-Scene Text Localization and Recognition with Oriented Stroke Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Luk치코 Neumann, Jiri Matas</p><p>Abstract: An unconstrained end-to-end text localization and recognition method is presented. The method introduces a novel approach for character detection and recognition which combines the advantages of sliding-window and connected component methods. Characters are detected and recognized as image regions which contain strokes of specific orientations in a specific relative position, where the strokes are efficiently detected by convolving the image gradient field with a set of oriented bar filters. Additionally, a novel character representation efficiently calculated from the values obtained in the stroke detection phase is introduced. The representation is robust to shift at the stroke level, which makes it less sensitive to intra-class variations and the noise induced by normalizing character size and positioning. The effectiveness of the representation is demonstrated by the results achieved in the classification of real-world characters using an euclidian nearestneighbor classifier trained on synthetic data in a plain form. The method was evaluated on a standard dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition.</p><p>4 0.83283746 <a title="376-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Class-Specific_Simplex-Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_for_Image_Classification.html">73 iccv-2013-Class-Specific Simplex-Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Mandar Dixit, Nikhil Rasiwasia, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: An extension of the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), denoted class-specific-simplex LDA (css-LDA), is proposed for image classification. An analysis of the supervised LDA models currently used for this task shows that the impact of class information on the topics discovered by these models is very weak in general. This implies that the discovered topics are driven by general image regularities, rather than the semantic regularities of interest for classification. To address this, we introduce a model that induces supervision in topic discovery, while retaining the original flexibility of LDA to account for unanticipated structures of interest. The proposed css-LDA is an LDA model with class supervision at the level of image features. In css-LDA topics are discovered per class, i.e. a single set of topics shared across classes is replaced by multiple class-specific topic sets. This model can be used for generative classification using the Bayes decision rule or even extended to discriminative classification with support vector machines (SVMs). A css-LDA model can endow an image with a vector of class and topic specific count statistics that are similar to the Bag-of-words (BoW) histogram. SVM-based discriminants can be learned for classes in the space of these histograms. The effectiveness of css-LDA model in both generative and discriminative classification frameworks is demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation, involving multiple benchmark datasets, where it is shown to outperform all existing LDA based image classification approaches.</p><p>5 0.82866812 <a title="376-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic-Aware_Co-indexing_for_Image_Retrieval.html">378 iccv-2013-Semantic-Aware Co-indexing for Image Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Shiliang Zhang, Ming Yang, Xiaoyu Wang, Yuanqing Lin, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: Inverted indexes in image retrieval not only allow fast access to database images but also summarize all knowledge about the database, so that their discriminative capacity largely determines the retrieval performance. In this paper, for vocabulary tree based image retrieval, we propose a semantic-aware co-indexing algorithm to jointly San Antonio, TX 78249 . j dl@gmai l com qit ian@cs .ut sa . edu . The query embed two strong cues into the inverted indexes: 1) local invariant features that are robust to delineate low-level image contents, and 2) semantic attributes from large-scale object recognition that may reveal image semantic meanings. For an initial set of inverted indexes of local features, we utilize 1000 semantic attributes to filter out isolated images and insert semantically similar images to the initial set. Encoding these two distinct cues together effectively enhances the discriminative capability of inverted indexes. Such co-indexing operations are totally off-line and introduce small computation overhead to online query cause only local features but no semantic attributes are used for query. Experiments and comparisons with recent retrieval methods on 3 datasets, i.e., UKbench, Holidays, Oxford5K, and 1.3 million images from Flickr as distractors, manifest the competitive performance of our method 1.</p><p>6 0.78377521 <a title="376-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Heterogeneous_Image_Features_Integration_via_Multi-modal_Semi-supervised_Learning_Model.html">194 iccv-2013-Heterogeneous Image Features Integration via Multi-modal Semi-supervised Learning Model</a></p>

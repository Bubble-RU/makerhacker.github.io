</p><p>5 Introduction Optimization of curvature and higher-order regularizers, in general, has significant potential in segmentation, stereo, 3D reconstruction, image restoration, in-painting, and other applications. [sent-21, score-0.644]
</p><p>6 success of global optimization methods for first-order MRF models [3, 10] researchers now focus on more difficult second-order functionals [34] including various discrete approximations of curvature [27, 7, 30]. [sent-29, score-0.771]
</p><p>7 Similarly, recent progress on global optimization techniques for first-order continuous geometric functionals [20, 23, 16, 35] has lead to extensions for curvature [4]. [sent-30, score-0.731]
</p><p>8 Our technique evaluates curvature using small patches either on a grid or on a cell complex, as illustrated in Fig. [sent-38, score-0.937]
</p><p>9 In case of a grid, our patches use a novel integral geometry approach to evaluating curvature. [sent-40, score-0.35]
</p><p>10 The relationship to previous discrete MRF models for curvature is discussed in Section 2. [sent-42, score-0.684]
</p><p>11 We also propose a very simple and efficient optimization technique, partial enumeration, directly applicable to our patch-based curvature model and some other high-order problems. [sent-43, score-0.722]

</p><p>18 However, each corner on a grid (c) should be evaluated using integral geometry by summing over multiple patches covering the corner. [sent-62, score-0.396]
</p><p>19 The accuracy of integral geometry approach to curvature on a grid is comparable to the standard basic geometry used on complexes, see (b) and (d). [sent-69, score-0.955]

</p><p>21 1(a) can be seen as “dual” methods for estimating curvature in exactly the same way as geo-cuts [2] and complexbased approach in [3 1] are “dual” methods for evaluating geometric length. [sent-76, score-0.668]
</p><p>22 Our grid-patch approach to curvature extends ideas in geo-cuts [2] that showed how discrete MRFbased regularization methods can use integral geometry to accurately approximate length via Cauchy-Crofton formula. [sent-77, score-0.932]
</p><p>23 1(a) uses an alternative method for approximating curvature based on standard geometry as in [27, 7, 30]. [sent-81, score-0.754]
</p><p>24 Our patch-based curvature models could be seen as extensions of functional lifting [4] or label elevation [21]. [sent-82, score-0.671]
</p><p>25 Our patch variables include enough information about the local boundary to reduce the curvature to unary terms. [sent-85, score-0.903]
</p><p>26 Their integer LP approach to curvature is formulated over a large number of binary variables defined on fine geometric primitives (vertexes, faces, edges, pairs of edges, etc), which are tied by constraints. [sent-87, score-0.709]
</p><p>27 In contrast, our unary representation of curvature uses larger scale geometric primitives (overlapping patches) tied by consistency constraints. [sent-88, score-0.813]
</p><p>28 Unlike [27] and us, [7, 30] represent curvature via high-order factors. [sent-90, score-0.644]
</p><p>29 While integral geometry estimates curvature on a pixel grid as accurately as the standard geometry on a cell complex, see Figs. [sent-96, score-1.011]
</p><p>30 Grid patches were also recently used for curvature evaluation in [28]. [sent-99, score-0.799]
</p><p>31 The mathematicaljustification of this approach to curvature estimation is not fully explained and several presented plots indicate its limited accuracy. [sent-103, score-0.644]
</p><p>32 As stated in [28], “the plots do also reveal the fact that we consistently overestimate the true curvature cost. [sent-104, score-0.644]
</p><p>33 ” The extreme “hard” case of this method may reduce to our technique if the cost of each pattern is assigned according to our integral geometry equations in Fig. [sent-105, score-0.254]
</p><p>34 Simple Patch-based Optimization One way to optimize our patch-based curvature model is to formulate the optimization problem on the original image pixel grid ? [sent-109, score-0.786]
</p><p>35 We propose a different approach for optimizing our highorder curvature models that equivalently reformulates the problem on a new graph, see Fig. [sent-118, score-0.693]
</p><p>36 One naive approach applicable to NP-hard highorder energies on small images is exhaustive search that enumerates all possible labelings of the underlying pixel graph. [sent-121, score-0.254]
</p><p>37 If some set of relatively small overlapping patches covers all high-order factors, we can build a new graph where nodes correspond to patches  (a)pixel-basedgraph(b)patch-basedgraph  Figure 2: Patch-based models in Fig. [sent-123, score-0.434]

</p><p>39 In (b) the curvature reduces to unary terms, but the graph includes pairwise consistency constraints due to patch overlaps. [sent-125, score-1.009]
</p><p>40 Note that high-order interactions reduce to unary potentials, but, due to patch overlap, hard pair-wise consistency constraints must be enforced. [sent-128, score-0.312]
</p><p>41 Our general approach transforms a high-order optimization problem to a pair-wise Constraint Satisfaction Problem with unary costs (uCSP). [sent-129, score-0.213]

</p><p>44 By enumerating all possible pixel states within the patch we can now encode  the higher order factor Eα (xα) into the unary term Uα (Xα) of (3). [sent-146, score-0.328]
</p><p>45 Optimization of pairwise energy (3) can be addressed with standard methods like [13, 9] that can be modified for our specific consistency constraints to gain significant speed-up (see Sec. [sent-153, score-0.23]
</p><p>46 LP relaxations When we apply method like TRW-S [13] to energy (3), we essentially solve a higher-order relaxation of the original energy (2). [sent-156, score-0.41]
</p><p>47 We then argue that the complexity of message passing in our scheme roughly matches that of other techniques that solve a similar relaxation. [sent-161, score-0.212]
</p><p>48 Researchers also considered alternative techniques for converting a high-order energy of binary variables into a pairwise one. [sent-167, score-0.234]
</p><p>49 We will compare to one such technique, [11], which generalizes roof duality to factors of order 3 and 4. [sent-168, score-0.291]
</p><p>50 Application to π/2-precision curvature In this section we illustrate our approach on a very coarse approximation of curvature where we only allow boundary edges that are either horizontal or vertical. [sent-171, score-1.34]

</p><p>52 To compute the curvature contribution of a patch we need to determine which of the 4 pixel boundaries also belong to the segmentation boundary. [sent-179, score-0.853]

</p><p>55 The curvature interaction and data terms of the original problem are now transformed to unary potentials. [sent-197, score-0.752]
</p><p>56 Note that since patches are overlapping pixels can be contained in up to four super nodes. [sent-198, score-0.469]
</p><p>57 In order not to change the energy we therefore weight the contribution from the original unary term, f(x) in (1), to each patch such that the total contribution is 1. [sent-199, score-0.37]
</p><p>58 For simplicity we give pixels that occur k times the weight 1/k in each super node. [sent-200, score-0.32]
</p><p>59 Finally to ensure that each pixel takes the same value in all the super nodes where it is contained we add the ”consistency” edges E between neighboring super nodes (see Fig. [sent-201, score-0.79]

We use shortest paths to minimize very general functionals of higher-order curve properties, such as curvature and torsion. Our globally optimal method uses line graphs and its runtime is polynomial in the size of the discretization, often in the order of seconds on a single computer. To our knowledge, we are the first to perform experiments in three dimensions with curvature and torsion regularization. The largest graphs we process have almost one hundred billion arcs. Experiments on medical images and in multi-view reconstruction show the significance and practical usefulness of regularization based on curvature while torsion is still only tractable for small-scale problems.</p><p>3 0.41162744 <a title="309-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-On_the_Mean_Curvature_Flow_on_Graphs_with_Applications_in_Image_and_Manifold_Processing.html">296 iccv-2013-On the Mean Curvature Flow on Graphs with Applications in Image and Manifold Processing</a></p>

<p>Author: Kwang In Kim, James Tompkin, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: One fundamental assumption in object recognition as well as in other computer vision and pattern recognition problems is that the data generation process lies on a manifold and that it respects the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. This assumption is held in several successful algorithms for diffusion and regularization, in particular, in graph-Laplacian-based algorithms. We claim that the performance of existing algorithms can be improved if we additionally account for how the manifold is embedded within the ambient space, i.e., if we consider the extrinsic geometry of the manifold. We present a procedure for characterizing the extrinsic (as well as intrinsic) curvature of a manifold M which is described by a sampled point cloud in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Once estimated, we use this characterization in general diffusion and regularization on M, and form a new regularizer on a point cloud. The resulting re-weighted graph Laplacian demonstrates superior performance over classical graph Laplacian in semisupervised learning and spectral clustering.</p><p>5 0.12620306 <a title="309-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Higher_Order_Matching_for_Consistent_Multiple_Target_Tracking.html">200 iccv-2013-Higher Order Matching for Consistent Multiple Target Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Chetan Arora, Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the data assignment problem in multi frame multi object tracking in video sequences. Traditional methods employing maximum weight bipartite matching offer limited temporal modeling. It has recently been shown [6, 8, 24] that incorporating higher order temporal constraints improves the assignment solution. Finding maximum weight matching with higher order constraints is however NP-hard and the solutions proposed until now have either been greedy [8] or rely on greedy rounding of the solution obtained from spectral techniques [15]. We propose a novel algorithm to find the approximate solution to data assignment problem with higher order temporal constraints using the method of dual decomposition and the MPLP message passing algorithm [21]. We compare the proposed algorithm with an implementation of [8] and [15] and show that proposed technique provides better solution with a bound on approximation factor for each inferred solution.</p><p>6 0.10716303 <a title="309-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Tree_Shape_Priors_with_Connectivity_Constraints_Using_Convex_Relaxation_on_General_Graphs.html">429 iccv-2013-Tree Shape Priors with Connectivity Constraints Using Convex Relaxation on General Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Carl Olsson, Johannes Ulén, Yuri Boykov, Vladimir Kolmogorov</p><p>Abstract: Energies with high-order non-submodular interactions have been shown to be very useful in vision due to their high modeling power. Optimization of such energies, however, is generally NP-hard. A naive approach that works for small problem instances is exhaustive search, that is, enumeration of all possible labelings of the underlying graph. We propose a general minimization approach for large graphs based on enumeration of labelings of certain small patches. This partial enumeration technique reduces complex highorder energy formulations to pairwise Constraint Satisfaction Problems with unary costs (uCSP), which can be efficiently solved using standard methods like TRW-S. Our approach outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art algorithms on well known difficult problems (e.g. curvature regularization, stereo, deconvolution); it gives near global minimum and better speed.

<p>Author: Petter Strandmark, Johannes Ulén, Fredrik Kahl, Leo Grady</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a method of finding thin, elongated structures in images and volumes. We use shortest paths to minimize very general functionals of higher-order curve properties, such as curvature and torsion. Our globally optimal method uses line graphs and its runtime is polynomial in the size of the discretization, often in the order of seconds on a single computer. To our knowledge, we are the first to perform experiments in three dimensions with curvature and torsion regularization. The largest graphs we process have almost one hundred billion arcs. Experiments on medical images and in multi-view reconstruction show the significance and practical usefulness of regularization based on curvature while torsion is still only tractable for small-scale problems.</p><p>3 0.90238643 <a title="309-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-On_the_Mean_Curvature_Flow_on_Graphs_with_Applications_in_Image_and_Manifold_Processing.html">296 iccv-2013-On the Mean Curvature Flow on Graphs with Applications in Image and Manifold Processing</a></p>

<p>Author: Jan Stühmer, Peter Schröder, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to include a connectivity prior into image segmentation that is based on a binary labeling of a directed graph, in this case a geodesic shortest path tree. Specifically we make two contributions: First, we construct a geodesic shortest path tree with a distance measure that is related to the image data and the bending energy of each path in the tree. Second, we include a connectivity prior in our segmentation model, that allows to segment not only a single elongated structure, but instead a whole connected branching tree. Because both our segmentation model and the connectivity constraint are convex, a global optimal solution can be found. To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure. To validate our method we present results on data from medical imaging in angiography and retinal blood vessel segmentation.</p><p>6 0.40914038 <a title="309-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Potts_Model%2C_Parametric_Maxflow_and_K-Submodular_Functions.html">324 iccv-2013-Potts Model, Parametric Maxflow and K-Submodular Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Claudia Nieuwenhuis, Evgeny Strekalovskiy, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a convex multilabel framework for image sequence segmentation which allows to impose proportion priors on object parts in order to preserve their size ratios across multiple images. The key idea is that for strongly deformable objects such as a gymnast the size ratio of respective regions (head versus torso, legs versus full body, etc.) is typically preserved. We propose different ways to impose such priors in a Bayesian framework for image segmentation. We show that near-optimal solutions can be computed using convex relaxation techniques. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proportion priors allow for highly accurate segmentations, avoiding seeping-out of regions and preserving semantically relevant small-scale structures such as hands or feet. They naturally apply to multiple object instances such as players in sports scenes, and they can relate different objects instead of object parts, e.g. organs in medical imaging. The algorithm is efficient and easily parallelized leading to proportion-consistent segmentations at runtimes around one second.</p><p>3 0.77029979 <a title="309-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Direct_Super-Resolution_by_Simple_Functions.html">156 iccv-2013-Fast Direct Super-Resolution by Simple Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Chih-Yuan Yang, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: The goal of single-image super-resolution is to generate a high-quality high-resolution image based on a given low-resolution input. It is an ill-posed problem which requires exemplars or priors to better reconstruct the missing high-resolution image details. In this paper, we propose to split the feature space into numerous subspaces and collect exemplars to learn priors for each subspace, thereby creating effective mapping functions. The use of split input space facilitates both feasibility of using simple functionsfor super-resolution, and efficiency ofgenerating highresolution results. High-quality high-resolution images are reconstructed based on the effective learned priors. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed algorithmperforms efficiently and effectively over state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.75952703 <a title="309-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Exemplar_Cut.html">150 iccv-2013-Exemplar Cut</a></p>
<p>Author: Jimei Yang, Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: We present a hybrid parametric and nonparametric algorithm, exemplar cut, for generating class-specific object segmentation hypotheses. For the parametric part, we train a pylon model on a hierarchical region tree as the energy function for segmentation. For the nonparametric part, we match the input image with each exemplar by using regions to obtain a score which augments the energy function from the pylon model. Our method thus generates a set of highly plausible segmentation hypotheses by solving a series of exemplar augmented graph cuts. Experimental results on the Graz and PASCAL datasets show that the proposed algorithm achievesfavorable segmentationperformance against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and accuracy.</p><p>5 0.75783777 <a title="309-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Temporally_Consistent_Superpixels.html">414 iccv-2013-Temporally Consistent Superpixels</a></p>

In this regards, this paper presents a highly competitive approach for temporally consistent superpixelsfor video content. The approach is based on energy-minimizing clustering utilizing a novel hybrid clustering strategy for a multi-dimensional feature space working in a global color subspace and local spatial subspaces. Moreover, a new contour evolution based strategy is introduced to ensure spatial coherency of the generated superpixels.

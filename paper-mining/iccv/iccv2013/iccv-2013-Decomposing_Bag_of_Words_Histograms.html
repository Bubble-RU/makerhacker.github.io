<p>Author: Dapeng Chen, Zejian Yuan, Yang Wu, Geng Zhang, Nanning Zheng</p><p>Abstract: Representation is a fundamental problem in object tracking. Conventional methods track the target by describing its local or global appearance. In this paper we present that, besides the two paradigms, the composition of local region histograms can also provide diverse and important object cues. We use cells to extract local appearance, and construct complex cells to integrate the information from cells. With different spatial arrangements of cells, complex cells can explore various contextual information at multiple scales, which is important to improve the tracking performance. We also develop a novel template-matching algorithm for object tracking, where the template is composed of temporal varying cells and has two layers to capture the target and background appearance respectively. An adaptive weight is associated with each complex cell to cope with occlusion as well as appearance variation. A fusion weight is associated with each complex cell type to preserve the global distinctiveness. Our algorithm is evaluated on 25 challenging sequences, and the results not only confirm the contribution of each component in our tracking system, but also outperform other competing trackers.</p><p>3 0.16941185 <a title="104-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Segmentation_Driven_Object_Detection_with_Fisher_Vectors.html">377 iccv-2013-Segmentation Driven Object Detection with Fisher Vectors</a></p>
<p>Author: Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis, Jakob Verbeek, Cordelia Schmid</p><p>Abstract: We present an object detection system based on the Fisher vector (FV) image representation computed over SIFT and color descriptors. For computational and storage efficiency, we use a recent segmentation-based method to generate class-independent object detection hypotheses, in combination with data compression techniques. Our main contribution is a method to produce tentative object segmentation masks to suppress background clutter in the features. Re-weighting the local image features based on these masks is shown to improve object detection significantly. We also exploit contextual features in the form of a full-image FV descriptor, and an inter-category rescoring mechanism. Our experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2010 datasets show that our detector improves over the current state-of-the-art detection results.</p><p>4 0.15961286 <a title="104-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic_Segmentation_without_Annotating_Segments.html">379 iccv-2013-Semantic Segmentation without Annotating Segments</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Xia, Csaba Domokos, Jian Dong, Loong-Fah Cheong, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: Numerous existing object segmentation frameworks commonly utilize the object bounding box as a prior. In this paper, we address semantic segmentation assuming that object bounding boxes are provided by object detectors, but no training data with annotated segments are available. Based on a set of segment hypotheses, we introduce a simple voting scheme to estimate shape guidance for each bounding box. The derived shape guidance is used in the subsequent graph-cut-based figure-ground segmentation. The final segmentation result is obtained by merging the segmentation results in the bounding boxes. We conduct an extensive analysis of the effect of object bounding box accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on both the challenging PASCAL VOC object segmentation dataset and GrabCut50 image segmentation dataset show that the proposed approach achieves competitive results compared to previous detection or bounding box prior based methods, as well as other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods.</p><p>5 0.15495916 <a title="104-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Non-convex_P-Norm_Projection_for_Robust_Sparsity.html">292 iccv-2013-Non-convex P-Norm Projection for Robust Sparsity</a></p>

<p>Author: Shaobing Gao, Kaifu Yang, Chaoyi Li, Yongjie Li</p><p>Abstract: The double-opponent color-sensitive cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) of the human visual system (HVS) have long been recognized as the physiological basis of color constancy. We introduce a new color constancy model by imitating the functional properties of the HVS from the retina to the double-opponent cells in V1. The idea behind the model originates from the observation that the color distribution of the responses of double-opponent cells to the input color-biased images coincides well with the light source direction. Then the true illuminant color of a scene is easily estimated by searching for the maxima of the separate RGB channels of the responses of double-opponent cells in the RGB space. Our systematical experimental evaluations on two commonly used image datasets show that the proposed model can produce competitive results in comparison to the complex state-of-the-art approaches, but with a simple implementation and without the need for training.</p><p>3 0.65748388 <a title="104-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Stacked_Predictive_Sparse_Coding_for_Classification_of_Distinct_Regions_in_Tumor_Histopathology.html">401 iccv-2013-Stacked Predictive Sparse Coding for Classification of Distinct Regions in Tumor Histopathology</a></p>
<p>Author: Hang Chang, Yin Zhou, Paul Spellman, Bahram Parvin</p><p>Abstract: Image-based classification ofhistology sections, in terms of distinct components (e.g., tumor, stroma, normal), provides a series of indices for tumor composition. Furthermore, aggregation of these indices, from each whole slide image (WSI) in a large cohort, can provide predictive models of the clinical outcome. However, performance of the existing techniques is hindered as a result of large technical variations and biological heterogeneities that are always present in a large cohort. We propose a system that automatically learns a series of basis functions for representing the underlying spatial distribution using stacked predictive sparse decomposition (PSD). The learned representation is then fed into the spatial pyramid matching framework (SPM) with a linear SVM classifier. The system has been evaluated for classification of (a) distinct histological components for two cohorts of tumor types, and (b) colony organization of normal and malignant cell lines in 3D cell culture models. Throughput has been increased through the utility of graphical processing unit (GPU), and evalu- ation indicates a superior performance results, compared with previous research.</p><p>4 0.6485247 <a title="104-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Constructing_Adaptive_Complex_Cells_for_Robust_Visual_Tracking.html">89 iccv-2013-Constructing Adaptive Complex Cells for Robust Visual Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Schiegg, Philipp Hanslovsky, Bernhard X. Kausler, Lars Hufnagel, Fred A. Hamprecht</p><p>Abstract: The quality of any tracking-by-assignment hinges on the accuracy of the foregoing target detection / segmentation step. In many kinds of images, errors in this first stage are unavoidable. These errors then propagate to, and corrupt, the tracking result. Our main contribution is the first probabilistic graphical model that can explicitly account for over- and undersegmentation errors even when the number of tracking targets is unknown and when they may divide, as in cell cultures. The tracking model we present implements global consistency constraints for the number of targets comprised by each detection and is solved to global optimality on reasonably large 2D+t and 3D+t datasets. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of a postprocessing that allows to establish target identity even across occlusion / undersegmentation. The usefulness and efficiency of this new tracking method is demonstrated on three different and challenging 2D+t and 3D+t datasets from developmental biology.</p><p>6 0.62109524 <a title="104-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Shufflets%3A_Shared_Mid-level_Parts_for_Fast_Object_Detection.html">390 iccv-2013-Shufflets: Shared Mid-level Parts for Fast Object Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Katherine L. Bouman, Bei Xiao, Peter Battaglia, William T. Freeman</p><p>Abstract: Passively estimating the intrinsic material properties of deformable objects moving in a natural environment is essential for scene understanding. We present a framework to automatically analyze videos of fabrics moving under various unknown wind forces, and recover two key material properties of the fabric: stiffness and area weight. We extend features previously developed to compactly represent static image textures to describe video textures, such as fabric motion. A discriminatively trained regression model is then used to predict the physical properties of fabric from these features. The success of our model is demonstrated on a new, publicly available database offabric videos with corresponding measured ground truth material properties. We show that our predictions are well correlated with ground truth measurements of stiffness and density for the fabrics. Our contributions include: (a) a database that can be used for training and testing algorithms for passively predicting fabric properties from video, (b) an algorithm for predicting the material properties of fabric from a video, and (c) a perceptual study of humans’ ability to estimate the material properties of fabric from videos and images.</p><p>2 0.8602168 <a title="104-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Segmentation_with_Cascaded_Hierarchical_Models_and_Logistic_Disjunctive_Normal_Networks.html">211 iccv-2013-Image Segmentation with Cascaded Hierarchical Models and Logistic Disjunctive Normal Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Mojtaba Seyedhosseini, Mehdi Sajjadi, Tolga Tasdizen</p><p>Abstract: Contextual information plays an important role in solving vision problems such as image segmentation. However, extracting contextual information and using it in an effective way remains a difficult problem. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-resolution contextual framework, called cascaded hierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical framework for image segmentation. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is trained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our model then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information into a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. We repeat this procedure by cascading the hierarchical framework to improve the segmentation accuracy. Multiple classifiers are learned in the CHM; therefore, a fast and accurate classifier is required to make the training tractable. The classifier also needs to be robust against overfitting due to the large number of parameters learned during training. We introduce a novel classification scheme, called logistic dis- junctive normal networks (LDNN), which consists of one adaptive layer of feature detectors implemented by logistic sigmoid functions followed by two fixed layers of logical units that compute conjunctions and disjunctions, respectively. We demonstrate that LDNN outperforms state-of-theart classifiers and can be used in the CHM to improve object segmentation performance.</p><p>3 0.85000151 <a title="104-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Partial_Enumeration_and_Curvature_Regularization.html">309 iccv-2013-Partial Enumeration and Curvature Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Olsson, Johannes Ulén, Yuri Boykov, Vladimir Kolmogorov</p><p>Abstract: Energies with high-order non-submodular interactions have been shown to be very useful in vision due to their high modeling power. Optimization of such energies, however, is generally NP-hard. A naive approach that works for small problem instances is exhaustive search, that is, enumeration of all possible labelings of the underlying graph. We propose a general minimization approach for large graphs based on enumeration of labelings of certain small patches. This partial enumeration technique reduces complex highorder energy formulations to pairwise Constraint Satisfaction Problems with unary costs (uCSP), which can be efficiently solved using standard methods like TRW-S. Our approach outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art algorithms on well known difficult problems (e.g. curvature regularization, stereo, deconvolution); it gives near global minimum and better speed. Our main application of interest is curvature regularization. In the context of segmentation, our partial enumeration technique allows to evaluate curvature directly on small patches using a novel integral geometry approach. 1</p><p>4 0.83010375 <a title="104-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Space-Time_Tradeoffs_in_Photo_Sequencing.html">397 iccv-2013-Space-Time Tradeoffs in Photo Sequencing</a></p>
<p>Author: Tali Dekel_(Basha), Yael Moses, Shai Avidan</p><p>Abstract: Photo-sequencing is the problem of recovering the temporal order of a set of still images of a dynamic event, taken asynchronously by a set of uncalibrated cameras. Solving this problem is a first, crucial step for analyzing (or visualizing) the dynamic content of the scene captured by a large number of freely moving spectators. We propose a geometric based solution, followed by rank aggregation to . ac . i l avidan@ eng .t au . ac . i l the photo-sequencing problem. Our algorithm trades spatial certainty for temporal certainty. Whereas the previous solution proposed by [4] relies on two images taken from the same static camera to eliminate uncertainty in space, we drop the static-camera assumption and replace it with temporal information available from images taken from the same (moving) camera. Our method thus overcomes the limitation of the static-camera assumption, and scales much better with the duration of the event and the spread of cameras in space. We present successful results on challenging real data sets and large scale synthetic data (250 images).</p><p>same-paper 5 0.82249796 <a title="104-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Decomposing_Bag_of_Words_Histograms.html">104 iccv-2013-Decomposing Bag of Words Histograms</a></p>
<p>Author: Ankit Gandhi, Karteek Alahari, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: We aim to decompose a global histogram representation of an image into histograms of its associated objects and regions. This task is formulated as an optimization problem, given a set of linear classifiers, which can effectively discriminate the object categories present in the image. Our decomposition bypasses harder problems associated with accurately localizing and segmenting objects. We evaluate our method on a wide variety of composite histograms, and also compare it with MRF-based solutions. In addition to merely measuring the accuracy of decomposition, we also show the utility of the estimated object and background histograms for the task of image classification on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.</p><p>6 0.80614722 <a title="104-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Shape_Anchors_for_Data-Driven_Multi-view_Reconstruction.html">387 iccv-2013-Shape Anchors for Data-Driven Multi-view Reconstruction</a></p>

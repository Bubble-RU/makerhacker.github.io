<p>Author: Tian Lan, Michalis Raptis, Leonid Sigal, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: The appearance of an object changes profoundly with pose, camera view and interactions of the object with other objects in the scene. This makes it challenging to learn detectors based on an object-level label (e.g., “car”). We postulate that having a richer set oflabelings (at different levels of granularity) for an object, including finer-grained subcategories, consistent in appearance and view, and higherorder composites – contextual groupings of objects consistent in their spatial layout and appearance, can significantly alleviate these problems. However, obtaining such a rich set of annotations, including annotation of an exponentially growing set of object groupings, is simply not feasible. We propose a weakly-supervised framework for object detection where we discover subcategories and the composites automatically with only traditional object-level category labels as input. To this end, we first propose an exemplar-SVM-based clustering approach, with latent SVM refinement, that discovers a variable length set of discriminative subcategories for each object class. We then develop a structured model for object detection that captures interactions among object subcategories and automatically discovers semantically meaningful and discriminatively relevant visual composites. We show that this model produces state-of-the-art performance on UIUC phrase object detection benchmark.</p><p>3 0.28324676 <a title="62-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-How_Do_You_Tell_a_Blackbird_from_a_Crow%3F.html">202 iccv-2013-How Do You Tell a Blackbird from a Crow?</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Berg, Peter N. Belhumeur</p><p>Abstract: How do you tell a blackbirdfrom a crow? There has been great progress toward automatic methods for visual recognition, including fine-grained visual categorization in which the classes to be distinguished are very similar. In a task such as bird species recognition, automatic recognition systems can now exceed the performance of non-experts – most people are challenged to name a couple dozen bird species, let alone identify them. This leads us to the question, “Can a recognition system show humans what to look for when identifying classes (in this case birds)? ” In the context of fine-grained visual categorization, we show that we can automatically determine which classes are most visually similar, discover what visual features distinguish very similar classes, and illustrate the key features in a way meaningful to humans. Running these methods on a dataset of bird images, we can generate a visual field guide to birds which includes a tree of similarity that displays the similarity relations between all species, pages for each species showing the most similar other species, and pages for each pair of similar species illustrating their differences.</p><p>4 0.27566829 <a title="62-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Compositional_Models_for_Video_Event_Detection%3A_A_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_Latent_Variable_Approach.html">85 iccv-2013-Compositional Models for Video Event Detection: A Multiple Kernel Learning Latent Variable Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Arash Vahdat, Kevin Cannons, Greg Mori, Sangmin Oh, Ilseo Kim</p><p>Abstract: We present a compositional model for video event detection. A video is modeled using a collection of both global and segment-level features and kernel functions are employed for similarity comparisons. The locations of salient, discriminative video segments are treated as a latent variable, allowing the model to explicitly ignore portions of the video that are unimportant for classification. A novel, multiple kernel learning (MKL) latent support vector machine (SVM) is defined, that is used to combine and re-weight multiple feature types in a principled fashion while simultaneously operating within the latent variable framework. The compositional nature of the proposed model allows it to respond directly to the challenges of temporal clutter and intra-class variation, which are prevalent in unconstrained internet videos. Experimental results on the TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection 2011 (MED11) dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the method.</p><p>5 0.22783269 <a title="62-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Fine-Grained_Categorization_by_Alignments.html">169 iccv-2013-Fine-Grained Categorization by Alignments</a></p>
<p>Author: E. Gavves, B. Fernando, C.G.M. Snoek, A.W.M. Smeulders, T. Tuytelaars</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this paper is fine-grained categorization without human interaction. Different from prior work, which relies on detectors for specific object parts, we propose to localize distinctive details by roughly aligning the objects using just the overall shape, since implicit to fine-grained categorization is the existence of a super-class shape shared among all classes. The alignments are then used to transfer part annotations from training images to test images (supervised alignment), or to blindly yet consistently segment the object in a number of regions (unsupervised alignment). We furthermore argue that in the distinction of finegrained sub-categories, classification-oriented encodings like Fisher vectors are better suited for describing localized information than popular matching oriented features like HOG. We evaluate the method on the CU-2011 Birds and Stanford Dogs fine-grained datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.20404276 <a title="62-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Deformable_Part_Descriptors_for_Fine-Grained_Recognition_and_Attribute_Prediction.html">107 iccv-2013-Deformable Part Descriptors for Fine-Grained Recognition and Attribute Prediction</a></p>

<p>Author: Ning Zhang, Ryan Farrell, Forrest Iandola, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing objects in fine-grained domains can be extremely challenging due to the subtle differences between subcategories. Discriminative markings are often highly localized, leading traditional object recognition approaches to struggle with the large pose variation often present in these domains. Pose-normalization seeks to align training exemplars, either piecewise by part or globally for the whole object, effectively factoring out differences in pose and in viewing angle. Prior approaches relied on computationally-expensive filter ensembles for part localization and required extensive supervision. This paper proposes two pose-normalized descriptors based on computationally-efficient deformable part models. The first leverages the semantics inherent in strongly-supervised DPM parts. The second exploits weak semantic annotations to learn cross-component correspondences, computing pose-normalized descriptors from the latent parts of a weakly-supervised DPM. These representations enable pooling across pose and viewpoint, in turn facilitating tasks such as fine-grained recognition and attribute prediction. Experiments conducted on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset and Berkeley Human Attribute dataset demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-art algorithms.</p><p>5 0.52880704 <a title="62-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Fine-Grained_Categorization_by_Alignments.html">169 iccv-2013-Fine-Grained Categorization by Alignments</a></p>

<p>Author: David Weiss, Benjamin Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: Ben Taskar University of Washington Seattle, WA t as kar @ c s . washingt on . edu In many cases, the predictive power of structured models for for complex vision tasks is limited by a trade-off between the expressiveness and the computational tractability of the model. However, choosing this trade-off statically a priori is suboptimal, as images and videos in different settings vary tremendously in complexity. On the other hand, choosing the trade-off dynamically requires knowledge about the accuracy of different structured models on any given example. In this work, we propose a novel two-tier architecture that provides dynamic speed/accuracy trade-offs through a simple type of introspection. Our approach, which we call dynamic structured model selection (DMS), leverages typically intractable features in structured learning problems in order to automatically determine ’ which of several models should be used at test-time in order to maximize accuracy under a fixed budgetary constraint. We demonstrate DMS on two sequential modeling vision tasks, and we establish a new state-of-the-art in human pose estimation in video with an implementation that is roughly 23 faster than the prevaino uims sptleanmdeanrtda implementation.</p><p>2 0.86661166 <a title="62-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_CRFs_for_Image_Parsing_with_Adaptive_Subgradient_Descent.html">234 iccv-2013-Learning CRFs for Image Parsing with Adaptive Subgradient Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Honghui Zhang, Jingdong Wang, Ping Tan, Jinglu Wang, Long Quan</p><p>Abstract: We propose an adaptive subgradient descent method to efficiently learn the parameters of CRF models for image parsing. To balance the learning efficiency and performance of the learned CRF models, the parameter learning is iteratively carried out by solving a convex optimization problem in each iteration, which integrates a proximal term to preserve the previously learned information and the large margin preference to distinguish bad labeling and the ground truth labeling. A solution of subgradient descent updating form is derived for the convex optimization problem, with an adaptively determined updating step-size. Besides, to deal with partially labeled training data, we propose a new objective constraint modeling both the labeled and unlabeled parts in the partially labeled training data for the parameter learning of CRF models. The superior learning efficiency of the proposed method is verified by the experiment results on two public datasets. We also demonstrate the powerfulness of our method for handling partially labeled training data.</p><p>3 0.86542785 <a title="62-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_General_Dense_Image_Matching_Framework_Combining_Direct_and_Feature-Based_Costs.html">12 iccv-2013-A General Dense Image Matching Framework Combining Direct and Feature-Based Costs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jim Braux-Zin, Romain Dupont, Adrien Bartoli</p><p>Abstract: Dense motion field estimation (typically Romain Dupont1 romain . dupont @ cea . fr Adrien Bartoli2 adrien . bart o l @ gmai l com i . 2 ISIT, Universit e´ d’Auvergne/CNRS, France sions are explicitly modeled [32, 13]. Coarse-to-fine warping improves global convergence by making the assumption that optical flow, the motion of smaller structures is similar to the motion of stereo disparity and surface registration) is a key computer vision problem. Many solutions have been proposed to compute small or large displacements, narrow or wide baseline stereo disparity, but a unified methodology is still lacking. We here introduce a general framework that robustly combines direct and feature-based matching. The feature-based cost is built around a novel robust distance function that handles keypoints and “weak” features such as segments. It allows us to use putative feature matches which may contain mismatches to guide dense motion estimation out of local minima. Our framework uses a robust direct data term (AD-Census). It is implemented with a powerful second order Total Generalized Variation regularization with external and self-occlusion reasoning. Our framework achieves state of the art performance in several cases (standard optical flow benchmarks, wide-baseline stereo and non-rigid surface registration). Our framework has a modular design that customizes to specific application needs.</p><p>4 0.862885 <a title="62-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Tree_Shape_Priors_with_Connectivity_Constraints_Using_Convex_Relaxation_on_General_Graphs.html">429 iccv-2013-Tree Shape Priors with Connectivity Constraints Using Convex Relaxation on General Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan Stühmer, Peter Schröder, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to include a connectivity prior into image segmentation that is based on a binary labeling of a directed graph, in this case a geodesic shortest path tree. Specifically we make two contributions: First, we construct a geodesic shortest path tree with a distance measure that is related to the image data and the bending energy of each path in the tree. Second, we include a connectivity prior in our segmentation model, that allows to segment not only a single elongated structure, but instead a whole connected branching tree. Because both our segmentation model and the connectivity constraint are convex, a global optimal solution can be found. To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure. To validate our method we present results on data from medical imaging in angiography and retinal blood vessel segmentation.</p><p>5 0.86247218 <a title="62-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Fix_Structured_Learning_of_2013_ICCV_paper_k2opt.pdf.html">171 iccv-2013-Fix Structured Learning of 2013 ICCV paper k2opt.pdf</a></p>
<p>Author: empty-author</p><p>Abstract: Submodular functions can be exactly minimized in polynomial time, and the special case that graph cuts solve with max flow [19] has had significant impact in computer vision [5, 21, 28]. In this paper we address the important class of sum-of-submodular (SoS) functions [2, 18], which can be efficiently minimized via a variant of max flow called submodular flow [6]. SoS functions can naturally express higher order priors involving, e.g., local image patches; however, it is difficult to fully exploit their expressive power because they have so many parameters. Rather than trying to formulate existing higher order priors as an SoS function, we take a discriminative learning approach, effectively searching the space of SoS functions for a higher order prior that performs well on our training set. We adopt a structural SVM approach [15, 34] and formulate the training problem in terms of quadratic programming; as a result we can efficiently search the space of SoS priors via an extended cutting-plane algorithm. We also show how the state-of-the-art max flow method for vision problems [11] can be modified to efficiently solve the submodular flow problem. Experimental comparisons are made against the OpenCVimplementation ofthe GrabCut interactive seg- mentation technique [28], which uses hand-tuned parameters instead of machine learning. On a standard dataset [12] our method learns higher order priors with hundreds of parameter values, and produces significantly better segmentations. While our focus is on binary labeling problems, we show that our techniques can be naturally generalized to handle more than two labels.</p><p>6 0.86094469 <a title="62-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Event_Detection_in_Complex_Scenes_Using_Interval_Temporal_Constraints.html">146 iccv-2013-Event Detection in Complex Scenes Using Interval Temporal Constraints</a></p>

An analysis of the supervised LDA models currently used for this task shows that the impact of class information on the topics discovered by these models is very weak in general. This implies that the discovered topics are driven by general image regularities, rather than the semantic regularities of interest for classification. To address this, we introduce a model that induces supervision in topic discovery, while retaining the original flexibility of LDA to account for unanticipated structures of interest. The proposed css-LDA is an LDA model with class supervision at the level of image features. In css-LDA topics are discovered per class, i.e. a single set of topics shared across classes is replaced by multiple class-specific topic sets. This model can be used for generative classification using the Bayes decision rule or even extended to discriminative classification with support vector machines (SVMs). A css-LDA model can endow an image with a vector of class and topic specific count statistics that are similar to the Bag-of-words (BoW) histogram. SVM-based discriminants can be learned for classes in the space of these histograms. The effectiveness of css-LDA model in both generative and discriminative classification frameworks is demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation, involving multiple benchmark datasets, where it is shown to outperform all existing LDA based image classification approaches.</p><p>Reference: <a title="iccv-2013-73-reference" href="../iccv2013_reference/iccv-2013-Class-Specific_Simplex-Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_for_Image_Classification_reference.html">text</a></p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 An analysis of the supervised LDA models currently used for this task shows that the impact of class information on the topics discovered by these models is very weak in general.

</p><p>4 a single set of topics shared across classes is replaced by multiple class-specific topic sets. [sent-14, score-0.629]
</p><p>5 A css-LDA model can endow an image with a vector of class and topic specific count statistics that are similar to the Bag-of-words (BoW) histogram. [sent-16, score-0.498]
</p><p>6 We refer to this as the flat model, due to its lack of hierarchical word groupings. [sent-25, score-0.34]
</p><p>7 Popular examples include hierarchical topic models, such as latent  Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [2] and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) [9]. [sent-28, score-0.441]
</p><p>8 Since LDA and pLSA topics are discovered in an unsupervised fashion, these models have limited use for classification. [sent-30, score-0.377]
</p><p>9 One popular extension is to apply a classifier, such as an SVM, to the topic representation [2, 3, 14]. [sent-32, score-0.375]
</p><p>10 We refer to these as discriminant extensions, and the combination of SVM with LDA topic vectors as SVM-LDA. [sent-33, score-0.348]
</p><p>11 Another popular generative extension is to directly equate the topics with the class labels themselves establishing a one-to-one mapping with between topics and  class labels, e. [sent-44, score-0.946]
</p><p>12 Theoretical analysis shows that the impact of class information on the topics discovered by cLDA and sLDA is very weak in general, and vanishes for large samples. [sent-50, score-0.481]
</p><p>13 Experiments demonstrate that the classification accuracies of cLDA and sLDA are not superior to those of unsupervised topic discovery. [sent-51, score-0.405]
</p><p>14 Topic-supervision establishes a much stronger correlation between the topics and the class labels, nevertheless they are unable to outperform the simple flat model. [sent-53, score-0.65]
</p><p>15 In fact, we show that topic supervised models are fundamentally not different from the flat model. [sent-54, score-0.594]
</p><p>16 To combine the labeling strength of topic-supervision with the flexibility of topic-discovery of LDA, we propose a novel classification architecture, denoted class-specific simplex LDA (css-LDA). [sent-55, score-0.298]
</p><p>17 Inspired by the flat model, css-LDA differs from the existing LDA extensions in that supervision is introduced directly at the level of image features. [sent-56, score-0.31]
</p><p>18 This induces the discovery of class-specific topic simplices and, consequently, class-specific topic distributions, enabling a much richer modeling of intra-class structure without compromising discrimination ability. [sent-57, score-0.784]
</p><p>19 This image representation can be described as a set of topic specific word counts, where topics are informed by class labels. [sent-61, score-0.852]
</p><p>20 In the absence of topic structure and supervision, this vector reduces to the standard BoW histogram [6, 17]. [sent-62, score-0.358]
</p><p>21 In this model, shown in Figure 1(c), a class variable Y is introduced as the parent of the topic prior Π. [sent-114, score-0.475]
</p><p>22 In this way, each class defines a prior distribution in topic space PΠ|Y (π|y; αy), conditioned on which the topic probability vecto(rπ π|y ;isα sampled. [sent-115, score-0.881]
</p><p>23 As shown in Figure 1(d), the class variable Y is conditioned by topics Z. [sent-121, score-0.433]
</p><p>24 Topic-conditional word distributions are learned with supervision and aligned with the class-conditional distributions of the flat model. [sent-139, score-0.593]
</p><p>25 Topic-Supervised Approaches Another popular approach to introduce supervision in  LDA, is to equate topics directly to the class labels. [sent-144, score-0.499]
</p><p>26 The resulting extension is denoted as topic supervised LDA (tsLDA) [20, 15]. [sent-145, score-0.394]
</p><p>27 The graphical model of the topic supervised extension of any LDA model is exactly the same as that of the model without topic supervision. [sent-146, score-0.804]
</p><p>28 The only, subtle yet significant, difference is that the topics are no longer discovered, but specified. [sent-147, score-0.281]
</p><p>29 This makes the topic-conditional distributions identical to the class-conditional distributions of the flat model. [sent-148, score-0.412]
</p><p>30 Figure 2(a) illustrates the two dimensional simplex of distributions over three words. [sent-160, score-0.367]
</p><p>31 Each topic in an LDA model defines a probability distribution over words and is represented as a point on the word simplex. [sent-167, score-0.548]
</p><p>32 Since topic probabilities are mixing probabilities for word distributions, a set of K topics defines a K−1 simfpolrex w ionr tdh dei wstroibrdu tsiiomnpsl,e ax s, e hte orfe K Kde tnooptiecds tdheef tnoepsic a Ksim−p1le sxi. [sent-168, score-0.749]

</p><p>34 Txh ies pa r loojwec-tdioimn eonfs i monaagles s obnthe topic simplex can be thought of as dimensionality reduction. [sent-170, score-0.594]
</p><p>35 In Figure 2(b), the two topics are represented by Λ1 and Λ2, and span a one-dimensional simplex, shown as a connecting line segment. [sent-171, score-0.281]
</p><p>36 In cLDA, each class defines a distribution (parameterized by αy) on the topic simplex. [sent-172, score-0.51]
</p><p>37 Similar to cLDA, sLDA can be represented on the topic simplex, where each class defines a softmax function3. [sent-174, score-0.542]
</p><p>38 Figure 2(c) shows the schematic of ts-cLDA for a two class problem on a three word simplex. [sent-175, score-0.273]
</p><p>39 While the topic distributions of cLDA, learned by topic discovery, can be positioned anywhere on the word simplex, those of ts-cLDA are specified, and identical to the class-conditional distributions of the flat model. [sent-178, score-1.206]
</p><p>40 3Strictly speaking, the softmax function is defined on the average of the sampled topic assignment labels z. [sent-179, score-0.389]
</p><p>41 However, when the number of features N is sufficiently large, z is proportional to the topic distribution π. [sent-180, score-0.357]
</p><p>42 Thus,  the softmax function  can  be thought of as defined  on  the topic simplex. [sent-181, score-0.389]
</p><p>43 Classification accuracy as function of the number of topics for sLDA and cLDA, using topics learned with and without class influence and codebooks of size 1024 on N13. [sent-184, score-0.74]
</p><p>44 Limitations of Existing Models In this section we present theoretical and experimental evidence that, contrary to popular belief, topics discovered by sLDA and cLDA are not more suitable for discrimination than those of standard LDA. [sent-187, score-0.414]
</p><p>45 In both sLDA and cLDA the parameters Λ1:K of the topic dis∑trib∑utions are obtained via the variational M-step as Λ∑kv ∝ ∑d ∑n δ(wnd, v)ϕndk, where d indexes the images, ∑v Λ∝kv∑ = ∑1, δ() is a Kronecker delta function and ϕnk i∑s the pa∑ram∑eter of the variational distribution q(z). [sent-189, score-0.494]
</p><p>46 The important point is that the class label yd only influences the topic distributions through (3) for cLDA (where αyd is used to compute the parameter γd) and (6) for sLDA (where the variational parameter ϕndk depends on the class label yd through ζydk/N). [sent-192, score-0.851]
</p><p>47 It follows that the connection between class label Y and the learned topics Γk is extremely weak. [sent-198, score-0.433]
</p><p>48 In summary, topics learned with either cLDA or sLDA are very unlikely to be informative of semantic regularities of interest for classification, and much more likely to capture generic regularities, common to all classes. [sent-204, score-0.401]
</p><p>49 To confirm these observations, we performed experiments with topics learned under two approaches. [sent-205, score-0.305]
</p><p>50 In the second we severed all connections with the class label variable during topic learning, by reducing the variational E-step (of both cLDA and sLDA) to,  γdk∗ = ∑ ϕndk +  α,  ϕdn∗k  ∝  Λkwnd exp  [ψ(γkd)]  (7)  ∑n  with α = 1. [sent-209, score-0.532]
</p><p>51 These results show that the performance of cLDA and sLDA is similar to that of topic learning without class supervision. [sent-219, score-0.455]
</p><p>52 In both cases, the class variable has very weak impact on the learning of topic distributions. [sent-220, score-0.455]
</p><p>53 Limitations of Topic-Supervised Models In the previous section, we have seen that models such as sLDA or cLDA effectively learn topics without supervision. [sent-223, score-0.281]
</p><p>54 The simplest solution to address the lack of correlation between class labels and the topics, is to force topics to reflect the semantic regularities of interest as is done in 4This discussion refers to the sLDA formulation of [19], which proposed specifically for image classification. [sent-224, score-0.505]
</p><p>55 For ts-sLDA and ts-cLDA the number of topics is equal to the number of classes. [sent-229, score-0.281]
</p><p>56 For sLDA and cLDA, results are presented for the number of topics of best performance. [sent-230, score-0.281]
</p><p>57 Class Specific Simplex Latent Dirichlet Allocation (css-LDA) To overcome the limitation of existing LDA based image classification models, in this section we introduce a new LDA model for image classification, denoted class-specific simplex LDA. [sent-239, score-0.316]
</p><p>58 Motivation The inability of the LDA variants to outperform the flat model is perhaps best understood by returning to Figure 2. [sent-242, score-0.297]
</p><p>59 Note that both cLDA and ts-cLDA map images from a high dimensional word simplex to a low dimensional topic simplex, which is common to all classes. [sent-243, score-0.745]
</p><p>60 This restricts the scope of the class models, which are simple Dirichlet distributions over the topic simplex. [sent-244, score-0.549]
</p><p>61 Since the topic simplex is common, and low dimensional, too few degrees of freedom are available to characterize intra-class structure, preventing a very detailed discrimination of the different classes. [sent-247, score-0.589]
</p><p>62 In fact, the main conclusion of the previous sections is that the bulk of the modeling power of LDA lies on the selection of the topic simplex, and not on the modeling of the data distribution in it. [sent-248, score-0.357]
</p><p>63 Since to capture the semantic regularities of the data, the simplex has to be aligned with the  Figure−102. [sent-249, score-0.34]

</p><p>65 Also shown are the nearest neighbor images of sample topic conditional distributions. [sent-253, score-0.355]
</p><p>66 class labels as is done under topic-supervision there is little room to outperform the flat model. [sent-254, score-0.369]
</p><p>67 This limitation is common to any model that constrains the class-conditional distributions to lie on a common topic simplex. [sent-255, score-0.439]
</p><p>68 This is the case whenever the class label Y is connected to either the prior or topic Z variables, as in the graphical models of Figure 1. [sent-256, score-0.504]
</p><p>69 Since the topic simplex is smaller than the word simplex, it has limited ability to simultaneously model rich intra-class structure and keep the classes separated. [sent-257, score-0.726]
</p><p>70 For this, it is necessary that the class label Y affects the word distributions directly, freeing these to distribute themselves across the word simplex in the most discriminant manner. [sent-258, score-0.719]
</p><p>71 This implies that Y must be connected to the word variable W, as in the flat model. [sent-259, score-0.34]
</p><p>72 The first follows from the fact that it makes the topic conditional distributions dependent on the class. [sent-261, score-0.449]
</p><p>73 Returning to Figure 2, this implies that the vertices of the topic simplex are class-dependent, as shown in (d). [sent-262, score-0.571]
</p><p>74 Note that there are two one-dimensional topic simplices, one for each class defined by the parameters Λ1y and Λ2y, y ∈ {1, 2}. [sent-263, score-0.455]
</p><p>75 Hence, each class is endowed with its own topic simplex justifying the denomination of the model as class-specific simplex LDA. [sent-266, score-0.961]
</p><p>76 With respect to LDA, because there are multiple topic simplices, the class-conditional distributions can have little overlap in word-simplex even when topic simplices are low dimensional. [sent-268, score-0.815]
</p><p>77 Under the flat model, the “Bocce” class is modeled by a single point in the word simplex, the average of all these distributions, as shown in Figure 2 (a). [sent-275, score-0.468]
</p><p>78 Rather than this, cssLDA devotes to each class a topic simplex, as shown in Figure 2 (d). [sent-277, score-0.455]
</p><p>79 In the example of Figure 2, while the flat model approximates all the images of each class by a point in word simplex, css-LDA relies on a line segment. [sent-279, score-0.486]
</p><p>80 In higher dimensions the difference can be much more substantial, since each topic simplex is a subspace of dimension K − 1 (K the number of topics), while the approximation oKf t−he 1 f (laKt m thoede nlu ims baelrwa ofys t oap ipcosi)n,t. [sent-280, score-0.571]

</p><p>90 Also shown is the class conditional distribution Λfylat (marked flat model) of the flat model. [sent-348, score-0.634]
</p><p>91 This shows that, on average, topics discovered by css-LDA  represent the class conditional distribution of the flat model. [sent-351, score-0.763]
</p><p>92 In fact, the KL divergence between the average of the topic conditional distributions of css-LDA and the class conditional distribution of the flat model is very close to zero (0. [sent-352, score-0.877]

<p>Author: Mandar Dixit, Nikhil Rasiwasia, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: An extension of the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), denoted class-specific-simplex LDA (css-LDA), is proposed for image classification. An analysis of the supervised LDA models currently used for this task shows that the impact of class information on the topics discovered by these models is very weak in general. This implies that the discovered topics are driven by general image regularities, rather than the semantic regularities of interest for classification. To address this, we introduce a model that induces supervision in topic discovery, while retaining the original flexibility of LDA to account for unanticipated structures of interest. The proposed css-LDA is an LDA model with class supervision at the level of image features. In css-LDA topics are discovered per class, i.e. a single set of topics shared across classes is replaced by multiple class-specific topic sets. This model can be used for generative classification using the Bayes decision rule or even extended to discriminative classification with support vector machines (SVMs). A css-LDA model can endow an image with a vector of class and topic specific count statistics that are similar to the Bag-of-words (BoW) histogram. SVM-based discriminants can be learned for classes in the space of these histograms. The effectiveness of css-LDA model in both generative and discriminative classification frameworks is demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation, involving multiple benchmark datasets, where it is shown to outperform all existing LDA based image classification approaches.</p><p>2 0.28801784 <a title="73-tfidf-2" href="./iccv-2013-Characterizing_Layouts_of_Outdoor_Scenes_Using_Spatial_Topic_Processes.html">72 iccv-2013-Characterizing Layouts of Outdoor Scenes Using Spatial Topic Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhiyuan Shi, Timothy M. Hospedales, Tao Xiang</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of localisation of objects as bounding boxes in images with weak labels. This weakly supervised object localisation problem has been tackled in the past using discriminative models where each object class is localised independently from other classes. We propose a novel framework based on Bayesian joint topic modelling. Our framework has three distinctive advantages over previous works: (1) All object classes and image backgrounds are modelled jointly together in a single generative model so that “explaining away” inference can resolve ambiguity and lead to better learning and localisation. (2) The Bayesian formulation of the model enables easy integration of prior knowledge about object appearance to compensate for limited supervision. (3) Our model can be learned with a mixture of weakly labelled and unlabelled data, allowing the large volume of unlabelled images on the Internet to be exploited for learning.

<p>Author: Ross Girshick, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we show how to train a deformable part model (DPM) fast—typically in less than 20 minutes, or four times faster than the current fastest method—while maintaining high average precision on the PASCAL VOC datasets. At the core of our approach is “latent LDA,” a novel generalization of linear discriminant analysis for learning latent variable models. Unlike latent SVM, latent LDA uses efficient closed-form updates and does not require an expensive search for hard negative examples. Our approach also acts as a springboard for a detailed experimental study of DPM training. We isolate and quantify the impact of key training factors for the first time (e.g., How important are discriminative SVM filters? How important is joint parameter estimation? How many negative images are needed for training?). Our findings yield useful insights for researchers working with Markov random fields and partbased models, and have practical implications for speeding up tasks such as model selection.</p><p>5 0.092935324 <a title="73-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Deep_Learning_Identity-Preserving_Face_Space.html">106 iccv-2013-Deep Learning Identity-Preserving Face Space</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenyao Zhu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: Face recognition with large pose and illumination variations is a challenging problem in computer vision. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a new learningbased face representation: the face identity-preserving (FIP) features. Unlike conventional face descriptors, the FIP features can significantly reduce intra-identity variances, while maintaining discriminativeness between identities. Moreover, the FIP features extracted from an image under any pose and illumination can be used to reconstruct its face image in the canonical view. This property makes it possible to improve the performance of traditional descriptors, such as LBP [2] and Gabor [31], which can be extracted from our reconstructed images in the canonical view to eliminate variations. In order to learn the FIP features, we carefully design a deep network that combines the feature extraction layers and the reconstruction layer. The former encodes a face image into the FIP features, while the latter transforms them to an image in the canonical view. Extensive experiments on the large MultiPIE face database [7] demonstrate that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art face recognition methods.</p><p>6 0.072367467 <a title="73-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Event_Understanding_Using_Natural_Language_Descriptions.html">440 iccv-2013-Video Event Understanding Using Natural Language Descriptions</a></p>

<p>Author: Mandar Dixit, Nikhil Rasiwasia, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: An extension of the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), denoted class-specific-simplex LDA (css-LDA), is proposed for image classification. An analysis of the supervised LDA models currently used for this task shows that the impact of class information on the topics discovered by these models is very weak in general. This implies that the discovered topics are driven by general image regularities, rather than the semantic regularities of interest for classification. To address this, we introduce a model that induces supervision in topic discovery, while retaining the original flexibility of LDA to account for unanticipated structures of interest. The proposed css-LDA is an LDA model with class supervision at the level of image features. In css-LDA topics are discovered per class, i.e. a single set of topics shared across classes is replaced by multiple class-specific topic sets. This model can be used for generative classification using the Bayes decision rule or even extended to discriminative classification with support vector machines (SVMs). A css-LDA model can endow an image with a vector of class and topic specific count statistics that are similar to the Bag-of-words (BoW) histogram. SVM-based discriminants can be learned for classes in the space of these histograms. The effectiveness of css-LDA model in both generative and discriminative classification frameworks is demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation, involving multiple benchmark datasets, where it is shown to outperform all existing LDA based image classification approaches.</p><p>2 0.7795952 <a title="73-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-Characterizing_Layouts_of_Outdoor_Scenes_Using_Spatial_Topic_Processes.html">72 iccv-2013-Characterizing Layouts of Outdoor Scenes Using Spatial Topic Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Eran Swears, Anthony Hoogs, Kim Boyer</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing functional scene elemeents in video scenes based on the behaviors of moving objects that interact with them is an emerging problem ooff interest. Existing approaches have a limited ability to chharacterize elements such as cross-walks, intersections, andd buildings that have low activity, are multi-modal, or havee indirect evidence. Our approach recognizes the low activvity and multi-model elements (crosswalks/intersections) by introducing a hierarchy of descriptive clusters to fform a pyramid of codebooks that is sparse in the numbber of clusters and dense in content. The incorporation oof local behavioral context such as person-enter-building aand vehicle-parking nearby enables the detection of elemennts that do not have direct motion-based evidence, e.g. buuildings. These two contributions significantly improvee scene element recognition when compared against thhree state-of-the-art approaches.

In contrast to existing video synopsis approaches that rely on visual cues alone, we propose a novel multi-source synopsis framework capable of correlating visual data and independent non-visual auxiliary information to better describe and summarise subtlephysical events in complex scenes. Specifically, our unsupervised framework is capable of seamlessly uncovering latent correlations among heterogeneous types of data sources, despite the non-trivial heteroscedasticity and dimensionality discrepancy problems. Additionally, the proposed model is robust to partial or missing non-visual information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on two crowded public surveillance datasets.</p><p>6 0.46813804 <a title="73-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Linear_Sequence_Discriminant_Analysis%3A_A_Model-Based_Dimensionality_Reduction_Method_for_Vector_Sequences.html">253 iccv-2013-Linear Sequence Discriminant Analysis: A Model-Based Dimensionality Reduction Method for Vector Sequences</a></p>

In this paper, we propose a two-layer structure for action recognition to automatically exploit a mid-level “acton ” representation. The weakly-supervised actons are learned via a new max-margin multi-channel multiple instance learning framework, which can capture multiple mid-level action concepts simultaneously. The learned actons (with no requirement for detailed manual annotations) observe theproperties ofbeing compact, informative, discriminative, and easy to scale. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness ofapplying the learned actons in our two-layer structure, and show the state-ofthe-art recognition performance on two challenging action datasets, i.e., Youtube and HMDB51.</p><p>3 0.73542702 <a title="73-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Characterizing_Layouts_of_Outdoor_Scenes_Using_Spatial_Topic_Processes.html">72 iccv-2013-Characterizing Layouts of Outdoor Scenes Using Spatial Topic Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Deyu Meng, Fernando De_La_Torre</p><p>Abstract: Many problems in computer vision can be posed as recovering a low-dimensional subspace from highdimensional visual data. Factorization approaches to lowrank subspace estimation minimize a loss function between an observed measurement matrix and a bilinear factorization. Most popular loss functions include the L2 and L1 losses. L2 is optimal for Gaussian noise, while L1 is for Laplacian distributed noise. However, real data is often corrupted by an unknown noise distribution, which is unlikely to be purely Gaussian or Laplacian. To address this problem, this paper proposes a low-rank matrix factorization problem with a Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) noise model. The MoG model is a universal approximator for any continuous distribution, and hence is able to model a wider range of noise distributions. The parameters of the MoG model can be estimated with a maximum likelihood method, while the subspace is computed with standard approaches. We illustrate the benefits of our approach in extensive syn- thetic and real-world experiments including structure from motion, face modeling and background subtraction.</p><p>5 0.7244482 <a title="73-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Recognizing_Text_with_Perspective_Distortion_in_Natural_Scenes.html">345 iccv-2013-Recognizing Text with Perspective Distortion in Natural Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Trung Quy Phan, Palaiahnakote Shivakumara, Shangxuan Tian, Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach to text recognition in natural scene images. Unlike most existing works which assume that texts are horizontal and frontal parallel to the image plane, our method is able to recognize perspective texts of arbitrary orientations. For individual character recognition, we adopt a bag-of-keypoints approach, in which Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptors are extracted densely and quantized using a pre-trained vocabulary. Following [1, 2], the context information is utilized through lexicons. We formulate word recognition as finding the optimal alignment between the set of characters and the list of lexicon words. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset called StreetViewText-Perspective, which contains texts in street images with a great variety of viewpoints. Experimental results on public datasets and the proposed dataset show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on perspective texts of arbitrary orientations.</p><p>6 0.72320396 <a title="73-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Super-resolution_via_Transform-Invariant_Group-Sparse_Regularization.html">408 iccv-2013-Super-resolution via Transform-Invariant Group-Sparse Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Kevin Tang, Bangpeng Yao, Li Fei-Fei, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of combining features extracted from video for complex event recognition. Feature combination is an especially relevant task in video data, as there are many features we can extract, ranging from image features computed from individual frames to video features that take temporal information into account. To combine features effectively, we propose a method that is able to be selective of different subsets of features, as some features or feature combinations may be uninformative for certain classes. We introduce a hierarchical method for combining features based on the AND/OR graph structure, where nodes in the graph represent combinations of different sets of features. Our method automatically learns the structure of the AND/OR graph using score-based structure learning, and we introduce an inference procedure that is able to efficiently compute structure scores. We present promising results and analysis on the difficult and large-scale 2011 TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection dataset [17].</p><p>3 0.14744654 <a title="274-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Event_Detection_in_Complex_Scenes_Using_Interval_Temporal_Constraints.html">146 iccv-2013-Event Detection in Complex Scenes Using Interval Temporal Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yifan Zhang, Qiang Ji, Hanqing Lu</p><p>Abstract: In complex scenes with multiple atomic events happening sequentially or in parallel, detecting each individual event separately may not always obtain robust and reliable result. It is essential to detect them in a holistic way which incorporates the causality and temporal dependency among them to compensate the limitation of current computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose an interval temporal constrained dynamic Bayesian network to extendAllen ’s interval algebra network (IAN) [2]from a deterministic static model to a probabilistic dynamic system, which can not only capture the complex interval temporal relationships, but also model the evolution dynamics and handle the uncertainty from the noisy visual observation. In the model, the topology of the IAN on each time slice and the interlinks between the time slices are discovered by an advanced structure learning method. The duration of the event and the unsynchronized time lags between two correlated event intervals are captured by a duration model, so that we can better determine the temporal boundary of the event. Empirical results on two real world datasets show the power of the proposed interval temporal constrained model.</p><p>4 0.13708135 <a title="274-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Concurrent_Action_Detection_with_Structural_Prediction.html">86 iccv-2013-Concurrent Action Detection with Structural Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Wei, Nanning Zheng, Yibiao Zhao, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Action recognition has often been posed as a classification problem, which assumes that a video sequence only have one action class label and different actions are independent. However, a single human body can perform multiple concurrent actions at the same time, and different actions interact with each other. This paper proposes a concurrent action detection model where the action detection is formulated as a structural prediction problem. In this model, an interval in a video sequence can be described by multiple action labels. An detected action interval is determined both by the unary local detector and the relations with other actions. We use a wavelet feature to represent the action sequence, and design a composite temporal logic descriptor to describe the action relations. The model parameters are trained by structural SVM learning. Given a long video sequence, a sequential decision window search algorithm is designed to detect the actions. Experiments on our new collected concurrent action dataset demonstrate the strength of our method.</p><p>5 0.13356356 <a title="274-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Data_Association%3A_Bayesian_Model_Selection_for_Multi-target_Tracking.html">230 iccv-2013-Latent Data Association: Bayesian Model Selection for Multi-target Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Aleksandr V. Segal, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel parametrization of the data association problem for multi-target tracking. In our formulation, the number of targets is implicitly inferred together with the data association, effectively solving data association and model selection as a single inference problem. The novel formulation allows us to interpret data association and tracking as a single Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS). We compute an approximate posterior solution to this problem using a dynamic programming/message passing technique. This inference-based approach allows us to incorporate richer probabilistic models into the tracking system. In particular, we incorporate inference over inliers/outliers and track termination times into the system. We evaluate our approach on publicly available datasets and demonstrate results competitive with, and in some cases exceeding the state of the art.</p><p>6 0.13351549 <a title="274-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminative_Label_Propagation_for_Multi-object_Tracking_with_Sporadic_Appearance_Features.html">120 iccv-2013-Discriminative Label Propagation for Multi-object Tracking with Sporadic Appearance Features</a></p>

<p>Author: K.C. Amit Kumar, Christophe De_Vleeschouwer</p><p>Abstract: Given a set of plausible detections, detected at each time instant independently, we investigate how to associate them across time. This is done by propagating labels on a set of graphs that capture how the spatio-temporal and the appearance cues promote the assignment of identical or distinct labels to a pair of nodes. The graph construction is driven by the locally linear embedding (LLE) of either the spatio-temporal or the appearance features associated to the detections. Interestingly, the neighborhood of a node in each appearance graph is defined to include all nodes for which the appearance feature is available (except the ones that coexist at the same time). This allows to connect the nodes that share the same appearance even if they are temporally distant, which gives our framework the uncommon ability to exploit the appearance features that are available only sporadically along the sequence of detections. Once the graphs have been defined, the multi-object tracking is formulated as the problem of finding a label assignment that is consistent with the constraints captured by each of the graphs. This results into a difference of convex program that can be efficiently solved. Experiments are performed on a basketball and several well-known pedestrian datasets in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</p><p>4 0.64890867 <a title="274-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Combining_the_Right_Features_for_Complex_Event_Recognition.html">81 iccv-2013-Combining the Right Features for Complex Event Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Ling Wang, Hichem Sahbi</p><p>Abstract: One of the trends of action recognition consists in extracting and comparing mid-level features which encode visual and motion aspects of objects into scenes. However, when scenes contain high-level semantic actions with many interacting parts, these mid-level features are not sufficient to capture high level structures as well as high order causal relationships between moving objects resulting into a clear drop in performances. In this paper, we address this issue and we propose an alternative action recognition method based on a novel graph kernel. In the main contributions of this work, we first describe actions in videos using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), that naturally encode pairwise interactions between moving object parts, and then we compare these DAGs by analyzing the spectrum of their sub-patterns that capture complex higher order interactions. This extraction and comparison process is computationally tractable, re- sulting from the acyclic property of DAGs, and it also defines a positive semi-definite kernel. When plugging the latter into support vector machines, we obtain an action recognition algorithm that overtakes related work, including graph-based methods, on a standard evaluation dataset.</p><p>6 0.63455033 <a title="274-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Concurrent_Action_Detection_with_Structural_Prediction.html">86 iccv-2013-Concurrent Action Detection with Structural Prediction</a></p>

Berg</p><p>Abstract: Entry level categories the labels people will use to name an object were originally defined and studied by psychologists in the 1980s. In this paper we study entrylevel categories at a large scale and learn the first models for predicting entry-level categories for images. Our models combine visual recognition predictions with proxies for word “naturalness ” mined from the enormous amounts of text on the web. We demonstrate the usefulness of our models for predicting nouns (entry-level words) associated with images by people. We also learn mappings between concepts predicted by existing visual recognition systems and entry-level concepts that could be useful for improving human-focused applications such as natural language image description or retrieval. – –</p><p>same-paper 2 0.67119634 <a title="274-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search_for_Scheduling_Activity_Recognition.html">274 iccv-2013-Monte Carlo Tree Search for Scheduling Activity Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohamed R. Amer, Sinisa Todorovic, Alan Fern, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an efficient approach to video parsing. Our videos show a number of co-occurring individual and group activities. To address challenges of the domain, we use an expressive spatiotemporal AND-OR graph (ST-AOG) that jointly models activity parts, their spatiotemporal relations, and context, as well as enables multitarget tracking. The standard ST-AOG inference is prohibitively expensive in our setting, since it would require running a multitude of detectors, and tracking their detections in a long video footage. This problem is addressed by formulating a cost-sensitive inference of ST-AOG as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For querying an activity in the video, MCTS optimally schedules a sequence of detectors and trackers to be run, and where they should be applied in the space-time volume. Evaluation on the benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCTS enables two-magnitude speed-ups without compromising accuracy relative to the standard cost-insensitive inference.</p><p>3 0.63562518 <a title="274-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Super-resolution_via_Transform-Invariant_Group-Sparse_Regularization.html">408 iccv-2013-Super-resolution via Transform-Invariant Group-Sparse Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Emmanuel J. Candès</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework to super-resolve planar regions found in urban scenes and other man-made environments by taking into account their 3D geometry. Such regions have highly structured straight edges, but this prior is challenging to exploit due to deformations induced by the projection onto the imaging plane. Our method factors out such deformations by using recently developed tools based on convex optimization to learn a transform that maps the image to a domain where its gradient has a simple group-sparse structure. This allows to obtain a novel convex regularizer that enforces global consistency constraints between the edges of the image. Computational experiments with real images show that this data-driven approach to the design of regularizers promoting transform-invariant group sparsity is very effective at high super-resolution factors. We view our approach as complementary to most recent superresolution methods, which tend to focus on hallucinating high-frequency textures.</p><p>4 0.58619946 <a title="274-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Minimal_Basis_Facility_Location_for_Subspace_Segmentation.html">264 iccv-2013-Minimal Basis Facility Location for Subspace Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Choon-Meng Lee, Loong-Fah Cheong</p><p>Abstract: In contrast to the current motion segmentation paradigm that assumes independence between the motion subspaces, we approach the motion segmentation problem by seeking the parsimonious basis set that can represent the data. Our formulation explicitly looks for the overlap between subspaces in order to achieve a minimal basis representation. This parsimonious basis set is important for the performance of our model selection scheme because the sharing of basis results in savings of model complexity cost. We propose the use of affinity propagation based method to determine the number of motion. The key lies in the incorporation of a global cost model into the factor graph, serving the role of model complexity. The introduction of this global cost model requires additional message update in the factor graph. We derive an efficient update for the new messages associated with this global cost model. An important step in the use of affinity propagation is the subspace hypotheses generation. We use the row-sparse convex proxy solution as an initialization strategy. We further encourage the selection of subspace hypotheses with shared basis by integrat- ing a discount scheme that lowers the factor graph facility cost based on shared basis. We verified the model selection and classification performance of our proposed method on both the original Hopkins 155 dataset and the more balanced Hopkins 380 dataset.</p><p>5 0.58300549 <a title="274-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Finding_Actors_and_Actions_in_Movies.html">166 iccv-2013-Finding Actors and Actions in Movies</a></p>
<p>Author: P. Bojanowski, F. Bach, I. Laptev, J. Ponce, C. Schmid, J. Sivic</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning a joint model of actors and actions in movies using weak supervision provided by scripts. Specifically, we extract actor/action pairs from the script and use them as constraints in a discriminative clustering framework. The corresponding optimization problem is formulated as a quadratic program under linear constraints. People in video are represented by automatically extracted and tracked faces together with corresponding motion features. First, we apply the proposed framework to the task of learning names of characters in the movie and demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods used for this task. Second, we explore the joint actor/action constraint and show its advantage for weakly supervised action learning. We validate our method in the challenging setting of localizing and recognizing characters and their actions in feature length movies Casablanca and American Beauty.</p><p>6 0.57508326 <a title="274-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-PixelTrack%3A_A_Fast_Adaptive_Algorithm_for_Tracking_Non-rigid_Objects.html">318 iccv-2013-PixelTrack: A Fast Adaptive Algorithm for Tracking Non-rigid Objects</a></p>

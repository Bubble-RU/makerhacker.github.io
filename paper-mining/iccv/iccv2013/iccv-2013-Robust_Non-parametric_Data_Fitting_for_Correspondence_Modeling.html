<p>Author: Yi Wu, Yoshihisa Ijiri, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Detecting and registering nonrigid surfaces are two important research problems for computer vision. Much work has been done with the assumption that there exists only one instance in the image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that detects and registers multiple nonrigid instances of given objects in a cluttered image. Specifically, after we use low level feature points to obtain the initial matches between templates and the input image, a novel high-order affinity graph is constructed to model the consistency of local topology. A hierarchical clustering approach is then used to locate the nonrigid surfaces. To remove the outliers in the cluster, we propose a deterministic annealing approach based on the Thin Plate Spline (TPS) model. The proposed method achieves high accuracy even when the number of outliers is nineteen times larger than the inliers. As the matches may appear sparsely in each instance, we propose a TPS based match growing approach to propagate the matches. Finally, an approach that fuses feature and appearance information is proposed to register each nonrigid surface. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves promis- ing results in detecting and registering multiple non-rigid surfaces in a cluttered scene.</p><p>3 0.22880517 <a title="358-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-A_General_Dense_Image_Matching_Framework_Combining_Direct_and_Feature-Based_Costs.html">12 iccv-2013-A General Dense Image Matching Framework Combining Direct and Feature-Based Costs</a></p>

Coarse-to-fine warping improves global convergence by making the assumption that optical flow, the motion of smaller structures is similar to the motion of stereo disparity and surface registration) is a key computer vision problem. Many solutions have been proposed to compute small or large displacements, narrow or wide baseline stereo disparity, but a unified methodology is still lacking. We here introduce a general framework that robustly combines direct and feature-based matching. The feature-based cost is built around a novel robust distance function that handles keypoints and “weak” features such as segments. It allows us to use putative feature matches which may contain mismatches to guide dense motion estimation out of local minima. Our framework uses a robust direct data term (AD-Census). It is implemented with a powerful second order Total Generalized Variation regularization with external and self-occlusion reasoning. Our framework achieves state of the art performance in several cases (standard optical flow benchmarks, wide-baseline stereo and non-rigid surface registration). Our framework has a modular design that customizes to specific application needs.</p><p>4 0.19039944 <a title="358-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-DeepFlow%3A_Large_Displacement_Optical_Flow_with_Deep_Matching.html">105 iccv-2013-DeepFlow: Large Displacement Optical Flow with Deep Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Philippe Weinzaepfel, Jerome Revaud, Zaid Harchaoui, Cordelia Schmid</p><p>Abstract: Optical flow computation is a key component in many computer vision systems designed for tasks such as action detection or activity recognition. However, despite several major advances over the last decade, handling large displacement in optical flow remains an open problem. Inspired by the large displacement optical flow of Brox & Malik [6], our approach, termed DeepFlow, blends a matching algorithm with a variational approach for optical flow. We propose a descriptor matching algorithm, tailored to the optical flow problem, that allows to boost performance on fast motions. The matching algorithm builds upon a multi-stage architecture with 6 layers, interleaving convolutions and max-pooling, a construction akin to deep convolutional nets. Using dense sampling, it allows to efficiently retrieve quasi-dense correspondences, and enjoys a built-in smoothing effect on descriptors matches, a valuable assetfor integration into an energy minimizationframework for optical flow estimation. DeepFlow efficiently handles large displacements occurring in realistic videos, and shows competitive performance on optical flow benchmarks. Furthermore, it sets a new state-of-the-art on the MPI-Sintel dataset [8].</p><p>5 0.18338034 <a title="358-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Modeling_Self-Occlusions_in_Dynamic_Shape_and_Appearance_Tracking.html">270 iccv-2013-Modeling Self-Occlusions in Dynamic Shape and Appearance Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Yanchao Yang, Ganesh Sundaramoorthi</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to track the precise shape of a dynamic object in video. Joint dynamic shape and appearance models, in which a template of the object is propagated to match the object shape and radiance in the next frame, are advantageous over methods employing global image statistics in cases of complex object radiance and cluttered background. In cases of complex 3D object motion and relative viewpoint change, self-occlusions and disocclusions of the object are prominent, and current methods employing joint shape and appearance models are unable to accurately adapt to new shape and appearance information, leading to inaccurate shape detection. In this work, we model self-occlusions and dis-occlusions in a joint shape and appearance tracking framework. Experiments on video exhibiting occlusion/dis-occlusion, complex radiance and background show that occlusion/dis-occlusion modeling leads to superior shape accuracy compared to recent methods employing joint shape/appearance models or employing global statistics.</p><p>6 0.14713526 <a title="358-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Compensating_for_Motion_during_Direct-Global_Separation.html">82 iccv-2013-Compensating for Motion during Direct-Global Separation</a></p>

<p>Author: Georgios Tzimiropoulos, Maja Pantic</p><p>Abstract: We describe a very simple framework for deriving the most-well known optimization problems in Active Appearance Models (AAMs), and most importantly for providing efficient solutions. Our formulation results in two optimization problems for fast and exact AAM fitting, and one new algorithm which has the important advantage of being applicable to 3D. We show that the dominant cost for both forward and inverse algorithms is a few times mN which is the cost of projecting an image onto the appearance subspace. This makes both algorithms not only computationally realizable but also very attractive speed-wise for most current systems. Because exact AAM fitting is no longer computationally prohibitive, we trained AAMs in-the-wild with the goal of investigating whether AAMs benefit from such a training process. Our results show that although we did not use sophisticated shape priors, robust features or robust norms for improving performance, AAMs perform notably well and in some cases comparably with current state-ofthe-art methods. We provide Matlab source code for training, fitting and reproducing the results presented in this paper at ht tp ://ibug. . doc . i . a c . uk/resources. c</p><p>4 0.59339213 <a title="358-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_General_Dense_Image_Matching_Framework_Combining_Direct_and_Feature-Based_Costs.html">12 iccv-2013-A General Dense Image Matching Framework Combining Direct and Feature-Based Costs</a></p>

<p>Author: Xin Cheng, Sridha Sridharan, Jason Saragih, Simon Lucey</p><p>Abstract: Active Appearance Models (AAMs) employ a paradigm of inverting a synthesis model of how an object can vary in terms of shape and appearance. As a result, the ability of AAMs to register an unseen object image is intrinsically linked to two factors. First, how well the synthesis model can reconstruct the object image. Second, the degrees of freedom in the model. Fewer degrees of freedom yield a higher likelihood of good fitting performance. In this paper we look at how these seemingly contrasting factors can complement one another for the problem of AAM fitting of an ensemble of images stemming from a constrained set (e.g. an ensemble of face images of the same person).</p><p>6 0.57071102 <a title="358-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-DeepFlow%3A_Large_Displacement_Optical_Flow_with_Deep_Matching.html">105 iccv-2013-DeepFlow: Large Displacement Optical Flow with Deep Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuqian Zhang, Cun Mu, Han-Wen Kuo, John Wright</p><p>Abstract: Illumination variation remains a central challenge in object detection and recognition. Existing analyses of illumination variation typically pertain to convex, Lambertian objects, and guarantee quality of approximation in an average case sense. We show that it is possible to build models for the set of images across illumination variation with worstcase performance guarantees, for nonconvex Lambertian objects. Namely, a natural verification test based on the distance to the model guarantees to accept any image which can be sufficiently well-approximated by an image of the object under some admissible lighting condition, and guarantees to reject any image that does not have a sufficiently good approximation. These models are generated by sampling illumination directions with sufficient density, which follows from a new perturbation bound for directional illuminated images in the Lambertian model. As the number of such images required for guaranteed verification may be large, we introduce a new formulation for cone preserving dimensionality reduction, which leverages tools from sparse and low-rank decomposition to reduce the complexity, while controlling the approximation error with respect to the original model. 1</p><p>3 0.84147727 <a title="358-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Minimal_Basis_Facility_Location_for_Subspace_Segmentation.html">264 iccv-2013-Minimal Basis Facility Location for Subspace Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Choon-Meng Lee, Loong-Fah Cheong</p><p>Abstract: In contrast to the current motion segmentation paradigm that assumes independence between the motion subspaces, we approach the motion segmentation problem by seeking the parsimonious basis set that can represent the data. Our formulation explicitly looks for the overlap between subspaces in order to achieve a minimal basis representation. This parsimonious basis set is important for the performance of our model selection scheme because the sharing of basis results in savings of model complexity cost. We propose the use of affinity propagation based method to determine the number of motion. The key lies in the incorporation of a global cost model into the factor graph, serving the role of model complexity. The introduction of this global cost model requires additional message update in the factor graph. We derive an efficient update for the new messages associated with this global cost model. An important step in the use of affinity propagation is the subspace hypotheses generation. We use the row-sparse convex proxy solution as an initialization strategy. We further encourage the selection of subspace hypotheses with shared basis by integrat- ing a discount scheme that lowers the factor graph facility cost based on shared basis. We verified the model selection and classification performance of our proposed method on both the original Hopkins 155 dataset and the more balanced Hopkins 380 dataset.</p><p>4 0.83974016 <a title="358-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Tree_Shape_Priors_with_Connectivity_Constraints_Using_Convex_Relaxation_on_General_Graphs.html">429 iccv-2013-Tree Shape Priors with Connectivity Constraints Using Convex Relaxation on General Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan Stühmer, Peter Schröder, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to include a connectivity prior into image segmentation that is based on a binary labeling of a directed graph, in this case a geodesic shortest path tree. Specifically we make two contributions: First, we construct a geodesic shortest path tree with a distance measure that is related to the image data and the bending energy of each path in the tree. Second, we include a connectivity prior in our segmentation model, that allows to segment not only a single elongated structure, but instead a whole connected branching tree. Because both our segmentation model and the connectivity constraint are convex, a global optimal solution can be found. To this end, we generalize a recent primal-dual algorithm for continuous convex optimization to an arbitrary graph structure. To validate our method we present results on data from medical imaging in angiography and retinal blood vessel segmentation.</p><p>5 0.83945131 <a title="358-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Generalized_Iterated_Shrinkage_Algorithm_for_Non-convex_Sparse_Coding.html">14 iccv-2013-A Generalized Iterated Shrinkage Algorithm for Non-convex Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Wangmeng Zuo, Deyu Meng, Lei Zhang, Xiangchu Feng, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In many sparse coding based image restoration and image classification problems, using non-convex ?p-norm minimization (0 ≤ p < 1) can often obtain better results than timhei convex 0?1 -norm m 1)ini camniza otfiteonn. Ab naiunm bbeetrt of algorithms, e.g., iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), iteratively thresholding method (ITM-?p), and look-up table (LUT), have been proposed for non-convex ?p-norm sparse coding, while some analytic solutions have been suggested for some specific values of p. In this paper, by extending the popular soft-thresholding operator, we propose a generalized iterated shrinkage algorithm (GISA) for ?p-norm non-convex sparse coding. Unlike the analytic solutions, the proposed GISA algorithm is easy to implement, and can be adopted for solving non-convex sparse coding problems with arbitrary p values. Compared with LUT, GISA is more general and does not need to compute and store the look-up tables. Compared with IRLS and ITM-?p, GISA is theoretically more solid and can achieve more accurate solutions. Experiments on image restoration and sparse coding based face recognition are conducted to validate the performance of GISA. ××</p><p>6 0.83849347 <a title="358-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Piecewise_Rigid_Scene_Flow.html">317 iccv-2013-Piecewise Rigid Scene Flow</a></p>

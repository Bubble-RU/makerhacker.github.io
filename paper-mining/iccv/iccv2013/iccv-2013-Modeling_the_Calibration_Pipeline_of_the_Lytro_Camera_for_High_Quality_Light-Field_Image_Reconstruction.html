<p>Author: Michael W. Tao, Sunil Hadap, Jitendra Malik, Ravi Ramamoorthi</p><p>Abstract: Light-field cameras have recently become available to the consumer market. An array of micro-lenses captures enough information that one can refocus images after acquisition, as well as shift one ’s viewpoint within the subapertures of the main lens, effectively obtaining multiple views. Thus, depth cues from both defocus and correspondence are available simultaneously in a single capture. Previously, defocus could be achieved only through multiple image exposures focused at different depths, while correspondence cues needed multiple exposures at different viewpoints or multiple cameras; moreover, both cues could not easily be obtained together. In this paper, we present a novel simple and principled algorithm that computes dense depth estimation by combining both defocus and correspondence depth cues. We analyze the x-u 2D epipolar image (EPI), where by convention we assume the spatial x coordinate is horizontal and the angular u coordinate is vertical (our final algorithm uses the full 4D EPI). We show that defocus depth cues are obtained by computing the horizontal (spatial) variance after vertical (angular) integration, and correspondence depth cues by computing the vertical (angular) variance. We then show how to combine the two cues into a high quality depth map, suitable for computer vision applications such as matting, full control of depth-of-field, and surface reconstruction.</p><p>3 0.15951601 <a title="271-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Towards_Motion_Aware_Light_Field_Video_for_Dynamic_Scenes.html">423 iccv-2013-Towards Motion Aware Light Field Video for Dynamic Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Salil Tambe, Ashok Veeraraghavan, Amit Agrawal</p><p>Abstract: Current Light Field (LF) cameras offer fixed resolution in space, time and angle which is decided a-priori and is independent of the scene. These cameras either trade-off spatial resolution to capture single-shot LF [20, 27, 12] or tradeoff temporal resolution by assuming a static scene to capture high spatial resolution LF [18, 3]. Thus, capturing high spatial resolution LF video for dynamic scenes remains an open and challenging problem. We present the concept, design and implementation of a LF video camera that allows capturing high resolution LF video. The spatial, angular and temporal resolution are not fixed a-priori and we exploit the scene-specific redundancy in space, time and angle. Our reconstruction is motion-aware and offers a continuum of resolution tradeoff with increasing motion in the scene. The key idea is (a) to design efficient multiplexing matrices that allow resolution tradeoffs, (b) use dictionary learning and sparse repre- sentations for robust reconstruction, and (c) perform local motion-aware adaptive reconstruction. We perform extensive analysis and characterize the performance of our motion-aware reconstruction algorithm. We show realistic simulations using a graphics simulator as well as real results using a LCoS based programmable camera. We demonstrate novel results such as high resolution digital refocusing for dynamic moving objects.</p><p>4 0.15230855 <a title="271-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Intrinsic_Calibration_from_a_Single_Frame_Using_a_%22Plumb-Line%22_Approach.html">436 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Intrinsic Calibration from a Single Frame Using a "Plumb-Line" Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: R. Melo, M. Antunes, J.P. Barreto, G. Falcão, N. Gonçalves</p><p>Abstract: Estimating the amount and center ofdistortionfrom lines in the scene has been addressed in the literature by the socalled “plumb-line ” approach. In this paper we propose a new geometric method to estimate not only the distortion parameters but the entire camera calibration (up to an “angular” scale factor) using a minimum of 3 lines. We propose a new framework for the unsupervised simultaneous detection of natural image of lines and camera parameters estimation, enabling a robust calibration from a single image. Comparative experiments with existing automatic approaches for the distortion estimation and with ground truth data are presented.</p><p>5 0.15215582 <a title="271-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-High_Quality_Shape_from_a_Single_RGB-D_Image_under_Uncalibrated_Natural_Illumination.html">199 iccv-2013-High Quality Shape from a Single RGB-D Image under Uncalibrated Natural Illumination</a></p>
<p>Author: Yudeog Han, Joon-Young Lee, In So Kweon</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel framework to estimate detailed shape of diffuse objects with uniform albedo from a single RGB-D image. To estimate accurate lighting in natural illumination environment, we introduce a general lighting model consisting oftwo components: global and local models. The global lighting model is estimated from the RGB-D input using the low-dimensional characteristic of a diffuse reflectance model. The local lighting model represents spatially varying illumination and it is estimated by using the smoothlyvarying characteristic of illumination. With both the global and local lighting model, we can estimate complex lighting variations in uncontrolled natural illumination conditions accurately. For high quality shape capture, a shapefrom-shading approach is applied with the estimated lighting model. Since the entire process is done with a single RGB-D input, our method is capable of capturing the high quality shape details of a dynamic object under natural illumination. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method that dramatically improves shape details of the rough depth input.</p><p>6 0.13969862 <a title="271-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Line_Assisted_Light_Field_Triangulation_and_Stereo_Matching.html">252 iccv-2013-Line Assisted Light Field Triangulation and Stereo Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicolas Martin, Vincent Couture, Sébastien Roy</p><p>Abstract: We present a scanning method that recovers dense subpixel camera-projector correspondence without requiring any photometric calibration nor preliminary knowledge of their relative geometry. Subpixel accuracy is achieved by considering several zero-crossings defined by the difference between pairs of unstructured patterns. We use gray-level band-pass white noise patterns that increase robustness to indirect lighting and scene discontinuities. Simulated and experimental results show that our method recovers scene geometry with high subpixel precision, and that it can handle many challenges of active reconstruction systems. We compare our results to state of the art methods such as micro phase shifting and modulated phase shifting.</p><p>4 0.66755998 <a title="271-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Line_Assisted_Light_Field_Triangulation_and_Stereo_Matching.html">252 iccv-2013-Line Assisted Light Field Triangulation and Stereo Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhan Yu, Xinqing Guo, Haibing Lin, Andrew Lumsdaine, Jingyi Yu</p><p>Abstract: Light fields are image-based representations that use densely sampled rays as a scene description. In this paper, we explore geometric structures of 3D lines in ray space for improving light field triangulation and stereo matching. The triangulation problem aims to fill in the ray space with continuous and non-overlapping simplices anchored at sampled points (rays). Such a triangulation provides a piecewise-linear interpolant useful for light field superresolution. We show that the light field space is largely bilinear due to 3D line segments in the scene, and direct triangulation of these bilinear subspaces leads to large errors. We instead present a simple but effective algorithm to first map bilinear subspaces to line constraints and then apply Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT). Based on our analysis, we further develop a novel line-assisted graphcut (LAGC) algorithm that effectively encodes 3D line constraints into light field stereo matching. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that both our triangulation and LAGC algorithms outperform state-of-the-art solutions in accuracy and visual quality.</p><p>5 0.66283542 <a title="271-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Refractive_Structure-from-Motion_on_Underwater_Images.html">348 iccv-2013-Refractive Structure-from-Motion on Underwater Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Anne Jordt-Sedlazeck, Reinhard Koch</p><p>Abstract: In underwater environments, cameras need to be confined in an underwater housing, viewing the scene through a piece of glass. In case of flat port underwater housings, light rays entering the camera housing are refracted twice, due to different medium densities of water, glass, and air. This causes the usually linear rays of light to bend and the commonly used pinhole camera model to be invalid. When using the pinhole camera model without explicitly modeling refraction in Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods, a systematic model error occurs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a system for computing camera path and 3D points with explicit incorporation of refraction using new methods for pose estimation. Additionally, a new error function is introduced for non-linear optimization, especially bundle adjustment. The proposed method allows to increase reconstruction accuracy and is evaluated in a set of experiments, where the proposed method’s performance is compared to SfM with the perspective camera model.</p><p>6 0.65021634 <a title="271-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_3D_Reconstruction_from_Uncalibrated_Radially-Symmetric_Cameras.html">280 iccv-2013-Multi-view 3D Reconstruction from Uncalibrated Radially-Symmetric Cameras</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhan Yu, Xinqing Guo, Haibing Lin, Andrew Lumsdaine, Jingyi Yu</p><p>Abstract: Light fields are image-based representations that use densely sampled rays as a scene description. In this paper, we explore geometric structures of 3D lines in ray space for improving light field triangulation and stereo matching. The triangulation problem aims to fill in the ray space with continuous and non-overlapping simplices anchored at sampled points (rays). Such a triangulation provides a piecewise-linear interpolant useful for light field superresolution. We show that the light field space is largely bilinear due to 3D line segments in the scene, and direct triangulation of these bilinear subspaces leads to large errors. We instead present a simple but effective algorithm to first map bilinear subspaces to line constraints and then apply Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT). Based on our analysis, we further develop a novel line-assisted graphcut (LAGC) algorithm that effectively encodes 3D line constraints into light field stereo matching. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that both our triangulation and LAGC algorithms outperform state-of-the-art solutions in accuracy and visual quality.</p><p>2 0.70939666 <a title="271-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Rolling_Shutter_Stereo.html">363 iccv-2013-Rolling Shutter Stereo</a></p>
<p>Author: Olivier Saurer, Kevin Köser, Jean-Yves Bouguet, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: A huge fraction of cameras used nowadays is based on CMOS sensors with a rolling shutter that exposes the image line by line. For dynamic scenes/cameras this introduces undesired effects like stretch, shear and wobble. It has been shown earlier that rotational shake induced rolling shutter effects in hand-held cell phone capture can be compensated based on an estimate of the camera rotation. In contrast, we analyse the case of significant camera motion, e.g. where a bypassing streetlevel capture vehicle uses a rolling shutter camera in a 3D reconstruction framework. The introduced error is depth dependent and cannot be compensated based on camera motion/rotation alone, invalidating also rectification for stereo camera systems. On top, significant lens distortion as often present in wide angle cameras intertwines with rolling shutter effects as it changes the time at which a certain 3D point is seen. We show that naive 3D reconstructions (assuming global shutter) will deliver biased geometry already for very mild assumptions on vehicle speed and resolution. We then develop rolling shutter dense multiview stereo algorithms that solve for time of exposure and depth at the same time, even in the presence of lens distortion and perform an evaluation on ground truth laser scan models as well as on real street-level data.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.70257503 <a title="271-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Modeling_the_Calibration_Pipeline_of_the_Lytro_Camera_for_High_Quality_Light-Field_Image_Reconstruction.html">271 iccv-2013-Modeling the Calibration Pipeline of the Lytro Camera for High Quality Light-Field Image Reconstruction</a></p>
<p>Author: Donghyeon Cho, Minhaeng Lee, Sunyeong Kim, Yu-Wing Tai</p><p>Abstract: Light-field imaging systems have got much attention recently as the next generation camera model. A light-field imaging system consists of three parts: data acquisition, manipulation, and application. Given an acquisition system, it is important to understand how a light-field camera converts from its raw image to its resulting refocused image. In this paper, using the Lytro camera as an example, we describe step-by-step procedures to calibrate a raw light-field image. In particular, we are interested in knowing the spatial and angular coordinates of the micro lens array and the resampling process for image reconstruction. Since Lytro uses a hexagonal arrangement of a micro lens image, additional treatments in calibration are required. After calibration, we analyze and compare the performances of several resampling methods for image reconstruction with and without calibration. Finally, a learning based interpolation method is proposed which demonstrates a higher quality image reconstruction than previous interpolation methods including a method used in Lytro software.</p><p>4 0.65814167 <a title="271-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Relative_Attributes_for_Large-Scale_Abandoned_Object_Detection.html">350 iccv-2013-Relative Attributes for Large-Scale Abandoned Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Quanfu Fan, Prasad Gabbur, Sharath Pankanti</p><p>Abstract: Effective reduction of false alarms in large-scale video surveillance is rather challenging, especially for applications where abnormal events of interest rarely occur, such as abandoned object detection. We develop an approach to prioritize alerts by ranking them, and demonstrate its great effectiveness in reducing false positives while keeping good detection accuracy. Our approach benefits from a novel representation of abandoned object alerts by relative attributes, namely staticness, foregroundness and abandonment. The relative strengths of these attributes are quantified using a ranking function[19] learnt on suitably designed low-level spatial and temporal features.These attributes of varying strengths are not only powerful in distinguishing abandoned objects from false alarms such as people and light artifacts, but also computationally efficient for large-scale deployment. With these features, we apply a linear ranking algorithm to sort alerts according to their relevance to the end-user. We test the effectiveness of our approach on both public data sets and large ones collected from the real world.</p><p>5 0.65647542 <a title="271-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Subspace_Stabilization_for_Stereoscopic_Video.html">226 iccv-2013-Joint Subspace Stabilization for Stereoscopic Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Feng Liu, Yuzhen Niu, Hailin Jin</p><p>Abstract: Shaky stereoscopic video is not only unpleasant to watch but may also cause 3D fatigue. Stabilizing the left and right view of a stereoscopic video separately using a monocular stabilization method tends to both introduce undesirable vertical disparities and damage horizontal disparities, which may destroy the stereoscopic viewing experience. In this paper, we present a joint subspace stabilization method for stereoscopic video. We prove that the low-rank subspace constraint for monocular video [10] also holds for stereoscopic video. Particularly, the feature trajectories from the left and right video share the same subspace. Based on this proof, we develop a stereo subspace stabilization method that jointly computes a common subspace from the left and right video and uses it to stabilize the two videos simultaneously. Our method meets the stereoscopic constraints without 3D reconstruction or explicit left-right correspondence. We test our method on a variety of stereoscopic videos with different scene content and camera motion. The experiments show that our method achieves high-quality stabilization for stereoscopic video in a robust and efficient way.</p><p>6 0.62637693 <a title="271-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Dictionary_Learning_and_Sparse_Coding_on_Grassmann_Manifolds%3A_An_Extrinsic_Solution.html">114 iccv-2013-Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding on Grassmann Manifolds: An Extrinsic Solution</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohit Gupta, Qi Yin, Shree K. Nayar</p><p>Abstract: Strong ambient illumination severely degrades the performance of structured light based techniques. This is especially true in outdoor scenarios, where the structured light sources have to compete with sunlight, whose power is often 2-5 orders of magnitude larger than the projected light. In this paper, we propose the concept of light-concentration to overcome strong ambient illumination. Our key observation is that given a fixed light (power) budget, it is always better to allocate it sequentially in several portions of the scene, as compared to spreading it over the entire scene at once. For a desired level of accuracy, we show that by distributing light appropriately, the proposed approach requires 1-2 orders lower acquisition time than existing approaches. Our approach is illumination-adaptive as the optimal light distribution is determined based on a measurement of the ambient illumination level. Since current light sources have a fixed light distribution, we have built a prototype light source that supports flexible light distribution by controlling the scanning speed of a laser scanner. We show several high quality 3D scanning results in a wide range of outdoor scenarios. The proposed approach will benefit 3D vision systems that need to operate outdoors under extreme ambient illumination levels on a limited time and power budget.</p><p>3 0.2152878 <a title="422-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Intrinsic_Calibration_from_a_Single_Frame_Using_a_%22Plumb-Line%22_Approach.html">436 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Intrinsic Calibration from a Single Frame Using a "Plumb-Line" Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: R. Melo, M. Antunes, J.P. Barreto, G. Falcão, N. Gonçalves</p><p>Abstract: Estimating the amount and center ofdistortionfrom lines in the scene has been addressed in the literature by the socalled “plumb-line ” approach. In this paper we propose a new geometric method to estimate not only the distortion parameters but the entire camera calibration (up to an “angular” scale factor) using a minimum of 3 lines. We propose a new framework for the unsupervised simultaneous detection of natural image of lines and camera parameters estimation, enabling a robust calibration from a single image. Comparative experiments with existing automatic approaches for the distortion estimation and with ground truth data are presented.</p><p>4 0.20815757 <a title="422-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Illuminant_Chromaticity_from_Image_Sequences.html">207 iccv-2013-Illuminant Chromaticity from Image Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Veronique Prinet, Dani Lischinski, Michael Werman</p><p>Abstract: We estimate illuminant chromaticity from temporal sequences, for scenes illuminated by either one or two dominant illuminants. While there are many methods for illuminant estimation from a single image, few works so far have focused on videos, and even fewer on multiple light sources. Our aim is to leverage information provided by the temporal acquisition, where either the objects or the camera or the light source are/is in motion in order to estimate illuminant color without the need for user interaction or using strong assumptions and heuristics. We introduce a simple physically-based formulation based on the assumption that the incident light chromaticity is constant over a short space-time domain. We show that a deterministic approach is not sufficient for accurate and robust estimation: however, a probabilistic formulation makes it possible to implicitly integrate away hidden factors that have been ignored by the physical model. Experimental results are reported on a dataset of natural video sequences and on the GrayBall benchmark, indicating that we compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.</p><p>5 0.17921951 <a title="422-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Color_Constancy_Model_with_Double-Opponency_Mechanisms.html">5 iccv-2013-A Color Constancy Model with Double-Opponency Mechanisms</a></p>
<p>Author: Shaobing Gao, Kaifu Yang, Chaoyi Li, Yongjie Li</p><p>Abstract: The double-opponent color-sensitive cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) of the human visual system (HVS) have long been recognized as the physiological basis of color constancy. We introduce a new color constancy model by imitating the functional properties of the HVS from the retina to the double-opponent cells in V1. The idea behind the model originates from the observation that the color distribution of the responses of double-opponent cells to the input color-biased images coincides well with the light source direction. Then the true illuminant color of a scene is easily estimated by searching for the maxima of the separate RGB channels of the responses of double-opponent cells in the RGB space. Our systematical experimental evaluations on two commonly used image datasets show that the proposed model can produce competitive results in comparison to the complex state-of-the-art approaches, but with a simple implementation and without the need for training.</p><p>6 0.15236072 <a title="422-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-High_Quality_Shape_from_a_Single_RGB-D_Image_under_Uncalibrated_Natural_Illumination.html">199 iccv-2013-High Quality Shape from a Single RGB-D Image under Uncalibrated Natural Illumination</a></p>

<p>Author: Ying Fu, Antony Lam, Imari Sato, Takahiro Okabe, Yoichi Sato</p><p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging is beneficial to many applications but current methods do not consider fluorescent effects which are present in everyday items ranging from paper, to clothing, to even our food. Furthermore, everyday fluorescent items exhibit a mix of reflectance and fluorescence. So proper separation of these components is necessary for analyzing them. In this paper, we demonstrate efficient separation and recovery of reflective and fluorescent emission spectra through the use of high frequency illumination in the spectral domain. With the obtained fluorescent emission spectra from our high frequency illuminants, we then present to our knowledge, the first method for estimating the fluorescent absorption spectrum of a material given its emission spectrum. Conventional bispectral measurement of absorption and emission spectra needs to examine all combinations of incident and observed light wavelengths. In contrast, our method requires only two hyperspectral images. The effectiveness of our proposed methods are then evaluated through a combination of simulation and real experiments. We also demonstrate an application of our method to synthetic relighting of real scenes.</p><p>5 0.7596454 <a title="422-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Simple_Model_for_Intrinsic_Image_Decomposition_with_Depth_Cues.html">30 iccv-2013-A Simple Model for Intrinsic Image Decomposition with Depth Cues</a></p>
<p>Author: Qifeng Chen, Vladlen Koltun</p><p>Abstract: We present a model for intrinsic decomposition of RGB-D images. Our approach analyzes a single RGB-D image and estimates albedo and shading fields that explain the input. To disambiguate the problem, our model estimates a number of components that jointly account for the reconstructed shading. By decomposing the shading field, we can build in assumptions about image formation that help distinguish reflectance variation from shading. These assumptions are expressed as simple nonlocal regularizers. We evaluate the model on real-world images and on a challenging synthetic dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms prior models for intrinsic decomposition of RGB-D images.</p><p>6 0.68703586 <a title="422-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-High_Quality_Shape_from_a_Single_RGB-D_Image_under_Uncalibrated_Natural_Illumination.html">199 iccv-2013-High Quality Shape from a Single RGB-D Image under Uncalibrated Natural Illumination</a></p>

As the number of such images required for guaranteed verification may be large, we introduce a new formulation for cone preserving dimensionality reduction, which leverages tools from sparse and low-rank decomposition to reduce the complexity, while controlling the approximation error with respect to the original model. 1</p><p>2 0.69706494 <a title="422-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Non-parametric_Data_Fitting_for_Correspondence_Modeling.html">358 iccv-2013-Robust Non-parametric Data Fitting for Correspondence Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-Yan Lin, Ming-Ming Cheng, Shuai Zheng, Jiangbo Lu, Nigel Crook</p><p>Abstract: We propose a generic method for obtaining nonparametric image warps from noisy point correspondences. Our formulation integrates a huber function into a motion coherence framework. This makes our fitting function especially robust to piecewise correspondence noise (where an image section is consistently mismatched). By utilizing over parameterized curves, we can generate realistic nonparametric image warps from very noisy correspondence. We also demonstrate how our algorithm can be used to help stitch images taken from a panning camera by warping the images onto a virtual push-broom camera imaging plane.</p><p>3 0.6947 <a title="422-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Pose-Configurable_Generic_Tracking_of_Elongated_Objects.html">320 iccv-2013-Pose-Configurable Generic Tracking of Elongated Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Wesierski, Patrick Horain</p><p>Abstract: Elongated objects have various shapes and can shift, rotate, change scale, and be rigid or deform by flexing, articulating, and vibrating, with examples as varied as a glass bottle, a robotic arm, a surgical suture, a finger pair, a tram, and a guitar string. This generally makes tracking of poses of elongated objects very challenging. We describe a unified, configurable framework for tracking the pose of elongated objects, which move in the image plane and extend over the image region. Our method strives for simplicity, versatility, and efficiency. The object is decomposed into a chained assembly of segments of multiple parts that are arranged under a hierarchy of tailored spatio-temporal constraints. In this hierarchy, segments can rescale independently while their elasticity is controlled with global orientations and local distances. While the trend in tracking is to design complex, structure-free algorithms that update object appearance on- line, we show that our tracker, with the novel but remarkably simple, structured organization of parts with constant appearance, reaches or improves state-of-the-art performance. Most importantly, our model can be easily configured to track exact pose of arbitrary, elongated objects in the image plane. The tracker can run up to 100 fps on a desktop PC, yet the computation time scales linearly with the number of object parts. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to generic tracking of elongated objects.</p><p>4 0.68503392 <a title="422-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-No_Matter_Where_You_Are%3A_Flexible_Graph-Guided_Multi-task_Learning_for_Multi-view_Head_Pose_Classification_under_Target_Motion.html">291 iccv-2013-No Matter Where You Are: Flexible Graph-Guided Multi-task Learning for Multi-view Head Pose Classification under Target Motion</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Yan, Elisa Ricci, Ramanathan Subramanian, Oswald Lanz, Nicu Sebe</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel Multi-Task Learning framework (FEGA-MTL) for classifying the head pose of a person who moves freely in an environment monitored by multiple, large field-of-view surveillance cameras. As the target (person) moves, distortions in facial appearance owing to camera perspective and scale severely impede performance of traditional head pose classification methods. FEGA-MTL operates on a dense uniform spatial grid and learns appearance relationships across partitions as well as partition-specific appearance variations for a given head pose to build region-specific classifiers. Guided by two graphs which a-priori model appearance similarity among (i) grid partitions based on camera geometry and (ii) head pose classes, the learner efficiently clusters appearancewise related grid partitions to derive the optimal partitioning. For pose classification, upon determining the target’s position using a person tracker, the appropriate regionspecific classifier is invoked. Experiments confirm that FEGA-MTL achieves state-of-the-art classification with few training data.</p><p>5 0.67521942 <a title="422-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-GOSUS%3A_Grassmannian_Online_Subspace_Updates_with_Structured-Sparsity.html">182 iccv-2013-GOSUS: Grassmannian Online Subspace Updates with Structured-Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jia Xu, Vamsi K. Ithapu, Lopamudra Mukherjee, James M. Rehg, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online subspace learning in the context of sequential observations involving structured perturbations. In online subspace learning, the observations are an unknown mixture of two components presented to the model sequentially the main effect which pertains to the subspace and a residual/error term. If no additional requirement is imposed on the residual, it often corresponds to noise terms in the signal which were unaccounted for by the main effect. To remedy this, one may impose ‘structural’ contiguity, which has the intended effect of leveraging the secondary terms as a covariate that helps the estimation of the subspace itself, instead of merely serving as a noise residual. We show that the corresponding online estimation procedure can be written as an approximate optimization process on a Grassmannian. We propose an efficient numerical solution, GOSUS, Grassmannian Online Subspace Updates with Structured-sparsity, for this problem. GOSUS is expressive enough in modeling both homogeneous perturbations of the subspace and structural contiguities of outliers, and after certain manipulations, solvable — via an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We evaluate the empirical performance of this algorithm on two problems of interest: online background subtraction and online multiple face tracking, and demonstrate that it achieves competitive performance with the state-of-the-art in near real time.</p><p>6 0.67118859 <a title="422-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Joint_Subspace_Stabilization_for_Stereoscopic_Video.html">226 iccv-2013-Joint Subspace Stabilization for Stereoscopic Video</a></p>

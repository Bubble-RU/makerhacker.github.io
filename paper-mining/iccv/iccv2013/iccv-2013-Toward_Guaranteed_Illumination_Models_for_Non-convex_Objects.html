<h1>422 iccv-2013-Toward Guaranteed Illumination Models for Non-convex Objects</h1>

Existing analyses of illumination variation typically pertain to convex, Lambertian objects, and guarantee quality of approximation in an average case sense. We show that it is possible to build models for the set of images across illumination variation with worstcase performance guarantees, for nonconvex Lambertian objects. Namely, a natural verification test based on the distance to the model guarantees to accept any image which can be sufficiently well-approximated by an image of the object under some admissible lighting condition, and guarantees to reject any image that does not have a sufficiently good approximation. These models are generated by sampling illumination directions with sufficient density, which follows from a new perturbation bound for directional illuminated images in the Lambertian model. As the number of such images required for guaranteed verification may be large, we introduce a new formulation for cone preserving dimensionality reduction, which leverages tools from sparse and low-rank decomposition to reduce the complexity, while controlling the approximation error with respect to the original model. 1</p><p>Reference: <a title="iccv-2013-422-reference" href="../iccv2013_reference/iccv-2013-Toward_Guaranteed_Illumination_Models_for_Non-convex_Objects_reference.html">text</a></p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Existing analyses of illumination variation typically pertain to convex, Lambertian objects, and guarantee quality of approximation in an average case sense.

</p><p>4 These approaches are often effective in practice, but can break down under extreme illumination. [sent-14, score-0.13]
</p><p>5 The seminal work [2] argues that images of a given object with fixed pose and varying illumination should lie near a convex cone in the high-dimensional image space. [sent-19, score-1.024]
</p><p>6 Many subsequent works have attempted to capture the gross structure of this cone using low-dimensional convex cone or linear subspace models [1, 15]. [sent-20, score-1.371]
</p><p>7 The promise of subspace or cone models, compared to feature-based approaches described above, is  that, by reasoning carefully about the image formation process, it might be possible to guarantee to well-approximate all images of the object under clearly delineated conditions. [sent-22, score-0.717]
</p><p>8 It is worth asking then, what approximation guarantees do current results afford us? [sent-23, score-0.207]
</p><p>9 For convex, Lambertian objects, by an elegant interpretation of the Lambertian reflectance as spherical convolution [1, 15], people showed that for uniformly random directional lightings, a nine dimensional spherical harmonic approximation captures on average about 98% of the energy [1, 8]. [sent-24, score-0.288]
</p><p>10 We study these questions in the context of a model problem in object instance verification, in which one is given an object O at a fixed pose, and ask whether tohnee i inspu gtiv viemnag ane oisb an itm Oag aet o af ftihxiesd dob pjoescet, u anndder a some evathliedr illumination condition. [sent-26, score-0.388]
</p><p>11 We develop rigorous guarantees for this problem, for general (including nonconvex) Lambertian objects. [sent-27, score-0.139]
</p><p>12 Our results show how to build a model that guarantees to accept every image that can be interpreted as an image of the object under some lighting condition, and to reject every image that is sufficiently dissimilar to all images of the object under valid lighting conditions. [sent-28, score-0.499]
</p><p>13 Similar to [12, 14, 19], our work approximates the illumination cone with a conic combination of certain images  on its boundary. [sent-29, score-0.967]
</p><p>14 To address 993377  this problem, we start from the goal of producing a sufficiently accurate representation of the illumination cone, and derive, in terms of the properties of the object and the scene, sufficient sampling densities for this goal to be met. [sent-31, score-0.334]
</p><p>15 Our bounds depend on the level of ambient illumination, and a notion of convexity defect of the object. [sent-32, score-0.361]
</p><p>16 They make precise the intuitions that: (i) it is more difficult to operate in low-light scenarios and (ii) nonconvex objects are more challenging than convex objects. [sent-33, score-0.254]
</p><p>17 To address this problem, we introduce a new approach to cone preserving complexity reduction. [sent-35, score-0.711]
</p><p>18 This approach leverages tools from convex programming in particular, sparse and low-rank decomposition [4, 5] but introduces a new constrained formulation which guarantees that the conic hull of the output will well-approximate the conic hull ofthe input. [sent-36, score-0.611]
</p><p>19 The low-rank and sparse decomposition leverages our qualitative understanding of the physical properties of images (low-dimensionality, sparsity of cast shadows) [1, 15, 21, 4, 22], while the constraint ensures that the output of this algorithm is always a good approximation to the target cone. [sent-37, score-0.254]
</p><p>20 Numerical experiments illustrate our bounds and their potential for worst case verification. [sent-40, score-0.13]

[sent-52, score-0.214]
</p><p>23 Since f resides in the convex cone, the set C0 y[F] ⊂ Rm of possible images is also a convex cone. [sent-53, score-0.25]

</p><p>28 The cone C0 can be interpreted as the set of all images of the object under different distant lighting conditions. [sent-63, score-0.768]
</p><p>29 Intuitively speaking, we expect the problem of representing images y under different illuminations to be more challenging when the light has a stronger directional component. [sent-64, score-0.135]
</p><p>30 To capture the relative contribution of directional and ambient components of light, we introduce a family of function classes Fα, indexed by parameter α ∈ [0, ∞). [sent-65, score-0.324]

<p>Author: Yuqian Zhang, Cun Mu, Han-Wen Kuo, John Wright</p><p>Abstract: Illumination variation remains a central challenge in object detection and recognition. Existing analyses of illumination variation typically pertain to convex, Lambertian objects, and guarantee quality of approximation in an average case sense. We show that it is possible to build models for the set of images across illumination variation with worstcase performance guarantees, for nonconvex Lambertian objects. Namely, a natural verification test based on the distance to the model guarantees to accept any image which can be sufficiently well-approximated by an image of the object under some admissible lighting condition, and guarantees to reject any image that does not have a sufficiently good approximation. These models are generated by sampling illumination directions with sufficient density, which follows from a new perturbation bound for directional illuminated images in the Lambertian model. As the number of such images required for guaranteed verification may be large, we introduce a new formulation for cone preserving dimensionality reduction, which leverages tools from sparse and low-rank decomposition to reduce the complexity, while controlling the approximation error with respect to the original model. 1</p><p>2 0.17512536 <a title="422-tfidf-2" href="./iccv-2013-Structured_Light_in_Sunlight.html">405 iccv-2013-Structured Light in Sunlight</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohit Gupta, Qi Yin, Shree K. Nayar</p><p>Abstract: Strong ambient illumination severely degrades the performance of structured light based techniques. This is especially true in outdoor scenarios, where the structured light sources have to compete with sunlight, whose power is often 2-5 orders of magnitude larger than the projected light. In this paper, we propose the concept of light-concentration to overcome strong ambient illumination. Our key observation is that given a fixed light (power) budget, it is always better to allocate it sequentially in several portions of the scene, as compared to spreading it over the entire scene at once. For a desired level of accuracy, we show that by distributing light appropriately, the proposed approach requires 1-2 orders lower acquisition time than existing approaches. Our approach is illumination-adaptive as the optimal light distribution is determined based on a measurement of the ambient illumination level. Since current light sources have a fixed light distribution, we have built a prototype light source that supports flexible light distribution by controlling the scanning speed of a laser scanner. We show several high quality 3D scanning results in a wide range of outdoor scenarios. The proposed approach will benefit 3D vision systems that need to operate outdoors under extreme ambient illumination levels on a limited time and power budget.</p><p>3 0.12521562 <a title="422-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-High_Quality_Shape_from_a_Single_RGB-D_Image_under_Uncalibrated_Natural_Illumination.html">199 iccv-2013-High Quality Shape from a Single RGB-D Image under Uncalibrated Natural Illumination</a></p>
<p>Author: Yudeog Han, Joon-Young Lee, In So Kweon</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel framework to estimate detailed shape of diffuse objects with uniform albedo from a single RGB-D image. To estimate accurate lighting in natural illumination environment, we introduce a general lighting model consisting oftwo components: global and local models. The global lighting model is estimated from the RGB-D input using the low-dimensional characteristic of a diffuse reflectance model. The local lighting model represents spatially varying illumination and it is estimated by using the smoothlyvarying characteristic of illumination. With both the global and local lighting model, we can estimate complex lighting variations in uncontrolled natural illumination conditions accurately. For high quality shape capture, a shapefrom-shading approach is applied with the estimated lighting model. Since the entire process is done with a single RGB-D input, our method is capable of capturing the high quality shape details of a dynamic object under natural illumination. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method that dramatically improves shape details of the rough depth input.</p><p>4 0.12266467 <a title="422-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-A_Color_Constancy_Model_with_Double-Opponency_Mechanisms.html">5 iccv-2013-A Color Constancy Model with Double-Opponency Mechanisms</a></p>
<p>Author: Shaobing Gao, Kaifu Yang, Chaoyi Li, Yongjie Li</p><p>Abstract: The double-opponent color-sensitive cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) of the human visual system (HVS) have long been recognized as the physiological basis of color constancy. We introduce a new color constancy model by imitating the functional properties of the HVS from the retina to the double-opponent cells in V1. The idea behind the model originates from the observation that the color distribution of the responses of double-opponent cells to the input color-biased images coincides well with the light source direction. Then the true illuminant color of a scene is easily estimated by searching for the maxima of the separate RGB channels of the responses of double-opponent cells in the RGB space. Our systematical experimental evaluations on two commonly used image datasets show that the proposed model can produce competitive results in comparison to the complex state-of-the-art approaches, but with a simple implementation and without the need for training.</p><p>5 0.10672189 <a title="422-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Affine-Constrained_Group_Sparse_Coding_and_Its_Application_to_Image-Based_Classifications.html">45 iccv-2013-Affine-Constrained Group Sparse Coding and Its Application to Image-Based Classifications</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu-Tseh Chi, Mohsen Ali, Muhammad Rushdi, Jeffrey Ho</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for sparse coding that further improves upon the sparse representation-based classification (SRC) framework. The proposed framework, Affine-Constrained Group Sparse Coding (ACGSC), extends the current SRC framework to classification problems with multiple input samples. Geometrically, the affineconstrained group sparse coding essentially searches for the vector in the convex hull spanned by the input vectors that can best be sparse coded using the given dictionary. The resulting objectivefunction is still convex and can be efficiently optimized using iterative block-coordinate descent scheme that is guaranteed to converge. Furthermore, we provide a form of sparse recovery result that guarantees, at least theoretically, that the classification performance of the constrained group sparse coding should be at least as good as the group sparse coding. We have evaluated the proposed approach using three different recognition experiments that involve illumination variation of faces and textures, and face recognition under occlusions. Prelimi- nary experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and in particular, the results from the recognition/occlusion experiment are surprisingly accurate and robust.</p><p>6 0.092817351 <a title="422-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_Simple_Model_for_Intrinsic_Image_Decomposition_with_Depth_Cues.html">30 iccv-2013-A Simple Model for Intrinsic Image Decomposition with Depth Cues</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuqian Zhang, Cun Mu, Han-Wen Kuo, John Wright</p><p>Abstract: Illumination variation remains a central challenge in object detection and recognition. Existing analyses of illumination variation typically pertain to convex, Lambertian objects, and guarantee quality of approximation in an average case sense. We show that it is possible to build models for the set of images across illumination variation with worstcase performance guarantees, for nonconvex Lambertian objects. Namely, a natural verification test based on the distance to the model guarantees to accept any image which can be sufficiently well-approximated by an image of the object under some admissible lighting condition, and guarantees to reject any image that does not have a sufficiently good approximation. These models are generated by sampling illumination directions with sufficient density, which follows from a new perturbation bound for directional illuminated images in the Lambertian model. As the number of such images required for guaranteed verification may be large, we introduce a new formulation for cone preserving dimensionality reduction, which leverages tools from sparse and low-rank decomposition to reduce the complexity, while controlling the approximation error with respect to the original model. 1</p><p>2 0.79624993 <a title="422-lsi-2" href="./iccv-2013-A_Simple_Model_for_Intrinsic_Image_Decomposition_with_Depth_Cues.html">30 iccv-2013-A Simple Model for Intrinsic Image Decomposition with Depth Cues</a></p>
<p>Author: Qifeng Chen, Vladlen Koltun</p><p>Abstract: We present a model for intrinsic decomposition of RGB-D images. Our approach analyzes a single RGB-D image and estimates albedo and shading fields that explain the input. To disambiguate the problem, our model estimates a number of components that jointly account for the reconstructed shading. By decomposing the shading field, we can build in assumptions about image formation that help distinguish reflectance variation from shading. These assumptions are expressed as simple nonlocal regularizers. We evaluate the model on real-world images and on a challenging synthetic dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms prior models for intrinsic decomposition of RGB-D images.</p><p>3 0.72816968 <a title="422-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Structured_Light_in_Sunlight.html">405 iccv-2013-Structured Light in Sunlight</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohit Gupta, Qi Yin, Shree K. Nayar</p><p>Abstract: Strong ambient illumination severely degrades the performance of structured light based techniques. This is especially true in outdoor scenarios, where the structured light sources have to compete with sunlight, whose power is often 2-5 orders of magnitude larger than the projected light. In this paper, we propose the concept of light-concentration to overcome strong ambient illumination. Our key observation is that given a fixed light (power) budget, it is always better to allocate it sequentially in several portions of the scene, as compared to spreading it over the entire scene at once. For a desired level of accuracy, we show that by distributing light appropriately, the proposed approach requires 1-2 orders lower acquisition time than existing approaches. Our approach is illumination-adaptive as the optimal light distribution is determined based on a measurement of the ambient illumination level. Since current light sources have a fixed light distribution, we have built a prototype light source that supports flexible light distribution by controlling the scanning speed of a laser scanner. We show several high quality 3D scanning results in a wide range of outdoor scenarios. The proposed approach will benefit 3D vision systems that need to operate outdoors under extreme ambient illumination levels on a limited time and power budget.</p><p>4 0.72224188 <a title="422-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Illuminant_Chromaticity_from_Image_Sequences.html">207 iccv-2013-Illuminant Chromaticity from Image Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Veronique Prinet, Dani Lischinski, Michael Werman</p><p>Abstract: We estimate illuminant chromaticity from temporal sequences, for scenes illuminated by either one or two dominant illuminants. While there are many methods for illuminant estimation from a single image, few works so far have focused on videos, and even fewer on multiple light sources. Our aim is to leverage information provided by the temporal acquisition, where either the objects or the camera or the light source are/is in motion in order to estimate illuminant color without the need for user interaction or using strong assumptions and heuristics. We introduce a simple physically-based formulation based on the assumption that the incident light chromaticity is constant over a short space-time domain. We show that a deterministic approach is not sufficient for accurate and robust estimation: however, a probabilistic formulation makes it possible to implicitly integrate away hidden factors that have been ignored by the physical model. Experimental results are reported on a dataset of natural video sequences and on the GrayBall benchmark, indicating that we compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.</p><p>5 0.71387267 <a title="422-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Separating_Reflective_and_Fluorescent_Components_Using_High_Frequency_Illumination_in_the_Spectral_Domain.html">385 iccv-2013-Separating Reflective and Fluorescent Components Using High Frequency Illumination in the Spectral Domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Ying Fu, Antony Lam, Imari Sato, Takahiro Okabe, Yoichi Sato</p><p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging is beneficial to many applications but current methods do not consider fluorescent effects which are present in everyday items ranging from paper, to clothing, to even our food. Furthermore, everyday fluorescent items exhibit a mix of reflectance and fluorescence. So proper separation of these components is necessary for analyzing them. In this paper, we demonstrate efficient separation and recovery of reflective and fluorescent emission spectra through the use of high frequency illumination in the spectral domain. With the obtained fluorescent emission spectra from our high frequency illuminants, we then present to our knowledge, the first method for estimating the fluorescent absorption spectrum of a material given its emission spectrum. Conventional bispectral measurement of absorption and emission spectra needs to examine all combinations of incident and observed light wavelengths. In contrast, our method requires only two hyperspectral images. The effectiveness of our proposed methods are then evaluated through a combination of simulation and real experiments. We also demonstrate an application of our method to synthetic relighting of real scenes.</p><p>6 0.65773606 <a title="422-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-A_Color_Constancy_Model_with_Double-Opponency_Mechanisms.html">5 iccv-2013-A Color Constancy Model with Double-Opponency Mechanisms</a></p>

<p>Author: Xu Wang, Stefan Atev, John Wright, Gilad Lerman</p><p>Abstract: The problem of efficiently deciding which of a database of models is most similar to a given input query arises throughout modern computer vision. Motivated by applications in recognition, image retrieval and optimization, there has been significant recent interest in the variant of this problem in which the database models are linear subspaces and the input is either a point or a subspace. Current approaches to this problem have poor scaling in high dimensions, and may not guarantee sublinear query complexity. We present a new approach to approximate nearest subspace search, based on a simple, new locality sensitive hash for subspaces. Our approach allows point-tosubspace query for a database of subspaces of arbitrary dimension d, in a time that depends sublinearly on the number of subspaces in the database. The query complexity of our algorithm is linear in the ambient dimension D, allow- ing it to be directly applied to high-dimensional imagery data. Numerical experiments on model problems in image repatching and automatic face recognition confirm the advantages of our algorithm in terms of both speed and accuracy.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.96222299 <a title="422-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Toward_Guaranteed_Illumination_Models_for_Non-convex_Objects.html">422 iccv-2013-Toward Guaranteed Illumination Models for Non-convex Objects</a></p>

<p>Author: De-An Huang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p><p>Abstract: Cross-domain image synthesis and recognition are typically considered as two distinct tasks in the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition. Therefore, it is not clear whether approaches addressing one task can be easily generalized or extended for solving the other. In this paper, we propose a unified model for coupled dictionary and feature space learning. The proposed learning model not only observes a common feature space for associating cross-domain image data for recognition purposes, the derived feature space is able to jointly update the dictionaries in each image domain for improved representation. This is why our method can be applied to both cross-domain image synthesis and recognition problems. Experiments on a variety of synthesis and recognition tasks such as single image super-resolution, cross-view action recognition, and sketchto-photo face recognition would verify the effectiveness of our proposed learning model.</p><p>4 0.95641178 <a title="422-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Cascaded_Shape_Space_Pruning_for_Robust_Facial_Landmark_Detection.html">70 iccv-2013-Cascaded Shape Space Pruning for Robust Facial Landmark Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaowei Zhao, Shiguang Shan, Xiujuan Chai, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel cascaded face shape space pruning algorithm for robust facial landmark detection. Through progressively excluding the incorrect candidate shapes, our algorithm can accurately and efficiently achieve the globally optimal shape configuration. Specifically, individual landmark detectors are firstly applied to eliminate wrong candidates for each landmark. Then, the candidate shape space is further pruned by jointly removing incorrect shape configurations. To achieve this purpose, a discriminative structure classifier is designed to assess the candidate shape configurations. Based on the learned discriminative structure classifier, an efficient shape space pruning strategy is proposed to quickly reject most incorrect candidate shapes while preserve the true shape. The proposed algorithm is carefully evaluated on a large set of real world face images. In addition, comparison results on the publicly available BioID and LFW face databases demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><p>5 0.94366527 <a title="422-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Finding_Causal_Interactions_in_Video_Sequences.html">167 iccv-2013-Finding Causal Interactions in Video Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Mustafa Ayazoglu, Burak Yilmaz, Mario Sznaier, Octavia Camps</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of detecting causal interactions in video clips. Specifically, the goal is to detect whether the actions of a given target can be explained in terms of the past actions of a collection of other agents. We propose to solve this problem by recasting it into a directed graph topology identification, where each node corresponds to the observed motion of a given target, and each link indicates the presence of a causal correlation. As shown in the paper, this leads to a block-sparsification problem that can be efficiently solved using a modified Group-Lasso type approach, capable of handling missing data and outliers (due for instance to occlusion and mis-identified correspondences). Moreover, this approach also identifies time instants where the interactions between agents change, thus providing event detection capabilities. These results are illustrated with several examples involving non–trivial interactions amongst several human subjects. 1. Introduction and Motivation The problem of identifying causal interactions amongst targets in a video sequence has been the focus of considerable attention in the past few years. A large portion of the existing body of work in this field uses human annotated video to build a storyline that includes both recognizing the activities involved and the causal relationships between them (see for instance [10] and references therein). While these methods are powerful and work well when suitably annotated data is available, annotating video clips is expensive and parsing relevant actions requires domain knowledge which may not be readily available. Indeed, in many situations, unveiling potentially hidden causal relationships is a first step towards building such knowledge. In this paper we consider the problem of identifying causal interactions amongst targets, not necessarily human, ∗This work was supported by NSF grants IIS–0713003, IIS-1318145, and ECCS–0901433, AFOSR grant FA9559–12–1–0271, and the Alert DHS Center of Excellence under Award Number 2008-ST-061-ED0001 . from unannotated video sequences and without prior domain knowledge. Our approach exploits the concept of “Granger Causality” [9], that formalizes the intuitive idea that ifa time series {x(t)} is causally related to a second one {thya(tt)if}a, ttihmene knowledge }oifs tchaeu past vrealluateesd otfo a{yse}c1to should l{eya(dt t}o, a ebnett kern prediction o thf efu ptuasret vvaalulueess ooff {{yx}}tt+k. In [l1ea4d], Pora ab bheatktearr eprt.e aicl.t successfully vuasleude a frequency domain reformulation of this concept to uncover pairwise interactions in scenarios involving repeating events, such as social games. This technique was later extended in [17] to model causal correlations between human joints and applied to the problem of activity classification. However, since this approach is based upon estimating the crosscovariance density function between events, it cannot handle situations where these events are non repeating, are too rare to provide an accurate estimate, or where these estimates are biased by outliers or missing data. Further, estimating a pairwise measure of causal correlation requires a spectral factorization of the cross-covariance, followed by numerical integration and statistical thresholding, limiting the approach to moderately large problems. To circumvent these problems, in this paper we propose an alternative approach based upon recasting the problem into that of identifying the topology of a sparse (directed) graph, where each node corresponds to the time traces of relevant features of a target, and each link corresponds to a regressor. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 1 using as an example the problem of finding causal relations amongst 4 tennis players, leading to a graph with 4 nodes, and potentially 12 (directed) links. Note that in general, the problem of identifying causal relationships is ill posed (unless one wants to identify the set of all individuals that could possibly have causal connections), due to the existence of secondary interactions. To illustrate this point, consider a very simplistic scenario with three actors A, B, and C, where A copies (with some delay) the actions of B, which in turn mimics C, also with some delay. In this situation, the ac- tions of A can be explained in terms of either those of B delayed one time sample, or those of C delayed by two samples. Thus, an algorithm based upon a statistical analysis 33556758 would identify a causal connection between A and C, even though there is no direct link between them. Further, if the actions of C can be explained by some simple autoregressive model of the form: = C(t) ?aiC(t − i) then it follows that the acti?ons of A can be explained by the same model, e.g. = A(t) ?aiA(t − i) Hence, multiple graphs topologies, some of which include self-loops, can explain the same set of time-series. On the other hand, note that in this situation, the sparsest graph (in the sense of having the fewest links) is the one that correctly captures the causality relations: the most direct cause of A is B and that of B is C, with C potentially being explained by a self-loop. To capture this feature and regularize the problem, in the sequel we will seek to find the sparsest graph, in the sense of having the least number of interconnections, that explains the observed data, reflecting the fact that, when alternative models are possible, often the most parsimonious is the correct one. Our main result shows that the problem of identifying sparse graph structures from observed noisy data can be reduced to a convex optimization problem (via the use of Group Lasso type arguments) that can be efficiently solved.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we provide a formal reformulation of the problem of finding causal relationships between agents as a sparse graph identification problem. In section 3, we show that this problem can be efficiently solved using a re-weighted Group Lasso approach. Moreover, as shown there, the resulting problem can be solved one node at a time using first order methods, which allows for handling situations involving a large number of agents. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated in section 4 using both simple scenarios (for which ground truth is readily available) and video clips of sports, involving complex, nonrepeating interactions amongst many agents.

Consider a scenario with P moving agents, and denote by the 3D homogenous coordinates of the pth individual at time t. Motivated by the idea of Granger Causality, we will say that the actions of this agent depend causally from those in a set Ip (which can possibly contain p itself), if can be written as: Q˜p(t) Q˜p(t) Q˜p(t) ?N = ? ?ajp(n)Q˜j(t − n) +˜ η p(t) +˜ u p(t) (1) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 Here ajp are unknown coefficients, and ˜η p(t) and up(t) represent measurement noise and a piecewise constant signal that is intended to account for relatively rare events that cannot be explained by the (past) actions of other agents. Examples include interactions of an agent with the environment, for instance to avoid obstacles, or changes in the interactions between agents. Since these events are infrequent, we will model as a signal that has (component-wise) a sparse derivative. Note in passing that since (1) involves homogeneous coordinates, the coefficients aj,p(.) satisfy the following constraint1 u ?N ? ?ajp(n) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 =1 (2) Our goal is to identify causal relationships using as data 2D measurements qp(t) in F frames of the affine projections of the 3D coordinates Q˜p(t) of the targets. Note that, under the affine camera assumption, the 2D coordinates are related exactly by the same regressor parameters [2]. Thus, (1) holds if and only if: ?N qp(t) = ? ?ajp(n)qj(t − n) + u˜ p(t) + ηp(t) (3) j?∈Ip ?n=0 In this context, the problem can be precisely stated as: Given qp(t) (in F number of frames) and some a-priori bound N on the order of the regressors (that is the “memory” of the interactions), find the sparsest set of equations of the form (3) that explains the data, that is: aj,pm,ηinp,up?nIp (4) subject to? ?(2) and: = ? ?ajp(n)qj(t − n) + ?N qp(t) j? ?∈Ip ?n=0 up(t) + ηp(t) , p = 1 . . . , P and t = 1, ..F 1This follows by considering the third coordinate in (1) (5) where nIp denotes the cardinality of the set Ip.

For instance, [1] proposed a Lasso type algorithm to identify a sparse network where each link corresponds to a VAR process. The main idea underlying this method is to exploit the fact that penalizing the ?1 norm of the vector of regression coefficients tends to produce sparse solutions. However, enforcing sparsity of the entire vector of regressor coefficients does not necessarily result in a sparse graph structure, since the resulting solution can consist of many links, each with a few coefficients. This difficulty can be circumvented by resorting to group Lasso type approaches [18], which seek to enforce block sparsity by using a combination of ?1 and ?2 norm constraints on the coefficients of the regressor. While this approach was shown to work well with artificial data in [11], exact recovery of the underlying network can be only guaranteed when the data satisfies suitable “incoherence” type conditions [4]. Finally, a different approach was pursued in [13], based on the use of a modified Orthogonal Least Squares algorithm, Cyclic Orthogonal Least Squares. However, this approach requires enforcing an a-priori limit on the number of links allowed to point to a single node, and such information may not be readily available, specially in cases where this number has high variability amongst nodes. To address these difficulties, in the next section we develop a convex optimization based approach to the problem of identifying sparse graph structures from observed noisy data. This method is closest in spirit to that in [11], in the sense that it is also based on a group Lasso type argument. The main differences consist in the ability to handle the unknown inputs up(t), needed to model exogenous disturbances affecting the agents, and in a reformulation of the problem, that allows for using a re-weighted iterative type algorithm, leading to substantially sparser solutions, even when the conditions in [4] fail. 3. Causality Identification Algorithm In this section we present the main result of this paper, an algorithm to search for block-sparse solutions to (7). For each fixed p, the algorithm searches for sparse solutions to (6) by solving (iteratively) the following problem (suggested by the re-weighted heuristic proposed in [7]) ?P ap,muxipn,uypi?=1wja(?aip?2) + λ??diag(wu)[Δuxp;Δuyp]??1 subject to: ?ηp ? ≤ p = 1, . . , P. ∞ ?P ?, ?N ??aip(n) i?= ?1 ?n=0 ?. = 1, p = 1,...,P. (9) where [Δuxp ; Δuyp] represents the first order differences of the exogenous input vector [uxp ; uyp], Wa and Wu are weighting matrices, and λ is a Lagrange multiplier that plays the role of a tuning parameter between graph sparsity and event sensitivity. Intuitively, for a fixed set of weights w, the algorithm attempts to find a block sparse solution to (6) and a set of sparse inp?uts Δuxp ; Δuyp , by exploiting the facts that minimizing ?i ?aip ?2 (the ?2,1 norm of the vector sequence {aip}) te?nds? tao m?aximize block-sparsity [18], while minimizing et?nhed s? 1t norm mmaizxeim blizoceks sparsity [ [1168]]. wOhniclee t mheisnesolutions are found, the weights w are adjusted to penalize those elements of the sequences with small values, so that in the next iteration solutions that set these elements to zero (hence further increasing sparsity) are favored. Note however, that proceeding in this way, requires solving at each iteration a problem with n = P(Pnr + F) variables, where P and F denote the number of agents and frames, respectively, and where nr is a bound on the regressor order. On the other hand, it is easily seen that both the objective function and the constraints in (9) can be partitioned into P groups, with the pth group involving only the variables related to the pth node. It follows then that problem (9) can be solved by solving P smaller problems of the form: ?P ap,muxipn,uypi?=1wja(?aip?2) + λ??diag(wu)[Δuxp;Δuyp]??1 ?P subject to: ?ηp?∞ ?N ≤ ? and ??aip(n) i?= ?1 ?n=0 leading to the algorithm given below: =1 (10) Algorithm 1: REWEIGHTEDCAUSALITYALGORITHM for each p wa = [1, 1, ..., 1] = [1, 1, ..., 1] S > 1(self loop weight) s = [1, 1, ..., S, ..., 1] (p’th element is S) while not converged do 1. solve (9) 2. wja = 1/( ?aip ?2 + δ) 3. wja = wja ◦ s (Penalization self loops) 4. = 1./(abs([Δuxp ; Δuyp]) + δ) end while 5. At this point ajp(.) , Ip and up(t) have been identified end for wu wu It is worth emphasizing that, since the computational complexity of standard interior point methods grows as n3, solving these smaller P problems leads to roughly a O(P2) 33557781 reduction in computational time over solving a single, larger optimization. Thus, this approach can handle moderately large problems using standard, interior-point based, semidefinite optimization solvers. Larger problems can be accommodated by noting that the special form of the objective and constraints allow for using iterative Augmented La- grangian Type Methods (ALM), based upon computing, at each step, the closed form solution to suitable intermediate optimization problems. While a complete derivation of such an algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper, using results from [12] it can be shown that each step requires only a combination of thresholding and least-squares approximations. Moreover, it can be shown that such an algorithm converges Q-superlinearly. 4. Handling Outliers and Missing Data The algorithm outlined above assumes an ideal situation where the data matrix B is perfectly known. However, in practice many of its elements may be outliers (due to misidentified correspondences) or missing (due to occlusion). As we briefly show next, these situations can be efficiently handled by performing a structured robust PCA step [3] to obtain a “clean” data matrix, prior to applying Algorithm 1. From equation (6) it follows that, in the absence of exogenous inputs and noise: ?xy11.. . .yxPP? = ?XY11.. . .YXPP? ?a1...aP? (11) Since xi ∈ {col(Xj)} and yi ∈ {col(Yj }), it follows that the sets {∈co {l(cXoli(X)} a)n}d a n{dco yl(Y∈i) { }c? are self-ex?pressive, or, ?equivalently?, Xthe }ma atnridce {sc oXl( =.) }? aXre1 . . . fX-eNxp? eanssdiv eY, ?Y1 ...YN? are mraantkri cdeesfic Xient. ?Consider no?w the case =.r, w?here some ?elements xi, yi of X and Y are missing.

Experimental Results In this section we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using several video clips (provided as supplemental material). The results of the experiments are displayed using graphs embedded on the video frames: An arrow indicates causal correlation between agents, with the point of the arrow indicating the agent whose actions are affected by the agent at its tail. The internal parameters of the algorithm were experimentally tuned, leading to the values ? = 0.1, = 0.05, self loop weights S = 10. The algorithm is fairly insensitive to the value of the regularization parameters and S, which could be adjusted up or down by an order of magnitude without affecting the structure of the resulting graph. Finally, we used regressor order N=2 for the first three examples and N=4 for the last one, a choice that is consistent with the frame rate and the complexity of λ λ the actions taking place in each clip. 5.1. Clips from the UT-Interaction Data Set We considered two video clips from the UT Human Interaction Data Set [15] (sequences 6 and 16). Figures 2 and 5 compare the results obtained applying the proposed algorithm versus Group Lasso (GL) [11] and Group Lasso combined with the reweighted heuristic described in (9) (GLRW). In all cases, the inputs to the algorithm were the (approximate) coordinates of the heads of each of the agents, normalized to the interval [−1, 1], artificially corrupted ,w niothrm m10al%iz eodut tloie trhs.e Notably, [t−he1 proposed algorithm 2As shown in [6, 8] under suitable conditions these relaxations the exact minimum rank solution. 33557792 recover Figure 2.

Only the proposed method identifies the correct connections. was able to correctly identify the correlations between the agents from this very limited amount of information, while the others failed to do so. Note in passing that in both cases none of the algorithms were directly applicable, due to some of the individuals leaving the field of view or being occluded. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the missing data was recovered by solving an RPCA problem prior to applying Algorithm 1. Finally, Fig. 4 sheds more insight on the key role played by the sparse signal u. As shown there, changes in u correspond exactly to time instants when the behavior of the corresponding agent deviates from the general pattern followed during most of the clip. Figure 3. Time traces of the individual heads in the UT sequence 6, artificially corrupted with 10 % outliers. The outliers were removed and the missing data due to targets leaving the field of view was estimated solving a modified RPCA problem. Frame number Figure 4.

Doubles Tennis Experiment This experiment considers a non-staged real-life scenario. The data consists of 230 frames of a video clip from the Australian Open Tennis Doubles Final games. The goal here is to identify causal relationships between the different players using time traces of the respective centroid positions. Note that in this case the ground truth is not available. Nevertheless, since players from the same team usually look at their opponents and react to their motions, we expect a strong causality connection between members of 33557803 opposite teams. This intuition is matched by the correlations unveiled by the algorithm, shown in Fig. 6. The identified sparse input corresponding to the vertical direction is shown in Fig. 7 (similar results for the horizontal component are omitted due to space reasons.) Figure 6. Sample frames from the tennis sequence. Top: The proposed method correctly identifies interactions between opposite team members. Center: Reweighted Group Lasso misses the interaction between the two rear-most individuals of opposite teams, generating self loops instead (denoted by the disks). Bottom: Group Lasso yields an almost complete graph. Figure 7. Exogenous signal corresponding to the vertical axis for the tennis sequence. The change in one component corresponds to the instant when the leftmost player in the bottom team moves from the line towards the net, remaining closer to it from then on. 5.3. Basketball Game Experiment This experiment considers the interactions amongst players in a basketball game. As in the case ofthe tennis players, since the data comes from a real life scenario, the ground truth is not available. However, contrary to the tennis game, this scenario involves complex interactions amongst many players, and causality is hard to discern by inspection. Nevertheless, the results shown in Fig. 8, obtained using the position of the centroids as inputs to our algorithm, match our intuition. Firstly, one would expect a strong cause/effect connection between the actions of the player with the ball and the two defending opponents facing him. These connections (denoted by the yellow arrows) were indeed successfully identified by the algorithm. The next set of causal correlations is represented by the (blue, light green) and (black, white) arrow pairs showing the defending and the opponent players on the far side of the field and under the hoop. An important, counterintuitive, connection identified by the algorithm is represented by the magenta arrows be- tween the right winger of the white team with two of his teammates: the one holding the ball and the one running behind all players. While at first sight this connection is not as obvious as the others, it becomes apparent towards the end of the sequence, when the right winger player is signaling with a raised arm. Notably, our algorithm was able to unveil this signaling without the need to perform a semantic analysis (a very difficult task here, since this signaling is apparent only in the last few frames). Rather, it used the fact that the causal correlation was encapsulated in the dynamics of the relative motions of these players. 6. Conclusions In this paper we propose a new method for detecting causal interactions between agents using video data. The main idea is to recast this problem into a blind directed graph topology identification, where each node corresponds to the observed motion of a given target, each link indicates the presence of a causal correlation and the unknown inputs account for changes in the interaction patterns. In turn, this problem can be reduced to that of finding block-sparse solutions to a set of linear equations, which can be efficiently accomplished using an iterative re-weighted Group-Lasso approach. The ability of the algorithm to correctly identify causal correlations, even in cases where portions of the data record are missing or corrupted by outliers, and the key role played by the unknown exogenous input were illustrated with several examples involving non–trivial inter- actions amongst several human subjects. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm was able to identify both the correct interactions and the time instants when interactions amongst agents changed, based on minimal motion information: in all cases we used just a single time trace per person. This success indicates that in many scenarios, the dynamic information contained in the motion pattern of a single feature associated with a target is rich enough to enable identifying complex interaction patterns, without the need to track multiple features, perform a semantic analysis or use additional domain knowledge. 33557814 Figure 8.

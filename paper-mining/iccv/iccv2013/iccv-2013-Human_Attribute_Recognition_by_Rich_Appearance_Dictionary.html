As a list of semantically meaningful properties of objects, attributes generally relate to each other statistically.

The model utilizes the captured relationships to benefit both attribute prediction and object recognition.

<p>Author: Adriana Kovashka, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: Current methods learn monolithic attribute predictors, with the assumption that a single model is sufficient to reflect human understanding of a visual attribute. However, in reality, humans vary in how they perceive the association between a named property and image content. For example, two people may have slightly different internal models for what makes a shoe look “formal”, or they may disagree on which of two scenes looks “more cluttered”. Rather than discount these differences as noise, we propose to learn user-specific attribute models. We adapt a generic model trained with annotations from multiple users, tailoring it to satisfy user-specific labels. Furthermore, we propose novel techniques to infer user-specific labels based on transitivity and contradictions in the user’s search history. We demonstrate that adapted attributes improve accuracy over both existing monolithic models as well as models that learn from scratch with user-specific data alone. In addition, we show how adapted attributes are useful to personalize image search, whether with binary or relative attributes.</p><p>4 0.40855747 <a title="204-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Dominance%3A_What_Pops_Out%3F.html">53 iccv-2013-Attribute Dominance: What Pops Out?</a></p>
<p>Author: Naman Turakhia, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: When we look at an image, some properties or attributes of the image stand out more than others. When describing an image, people are likely to describe these dominant attributes first. Attribute dominance is a result of a complex interplay between the various properties present or absent in the image. Which attributes in an image are more dominant than others reveals rich information about the content of the image. In this paper we tap into this information by modeling attribute dominance. We show that this helps improve the performance of vision systems on a variety of human-centric applications such as zero-shot learning, image search and generating textual descriptions of images.</p><p>5 0.33935437 <a title="204-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Spoken_Attributes%3A_Mixing_Binary_and_Relative_Attributes_to_Say_the_Right_Thing.html">399 iccv-2013-Spoken Attributes: Mixing Binary and Relative Attributes to Say the Right Thing</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Sadovnik, Andrew Gallagher, Devi Parikh, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a great deal of progress in describing objects with attributes. Attributes have proven useful for object recognition, image search, face verification, image description, and zero-shot learning. Typically, attributes are either binary or relative: they describe either the presence or absence of a descriptive characteristic, or the relative magnitude of the characteristic when comparing two exemplars. However, prior work fails to model the actual way in which humans use these attributes in descriptive statements of images. Specifically, it does not address the important interactions between the binary and relative aspects of an attribute. In this work we propose a spoken attribute classifier which models a more natural way of using an attribute in a description. For each attribute we train a classifier which captures the specific way this attribute should be used. We show that as a result of using this model, we produce descriptions about images of people that are more natural and specific than past systems.</p><p>6 0.2737909 <a title="204-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic_Transform%3A_Weakly_Supervised_Semantic_Inference_for_Relating_Visual_Attributes.html">380 iccv-2013-Semantic Transform: Weakly Supervised Semantic Inference for Relating Visual Attributes</a></p>

<p>Author: Ming Shao, Liangyue Li, Yun Fu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of recognizing occupations of multiple people with arbitrary poses in a photo. Previous work utilizing single person ’s nearly frontal clothing information and fore/background context preliminarily proves that occupation recognition is computationally feasible in computer vision. However, in practice, multiple people with arbitrary poses are common in a photo, and recognizing their occupations is even more challenging. We argue that with appropriately built visual attributes, co-occurrence, and spatial configuration model that is learned through structure SVM, we can recognize multiple people ’s occupations in a photo simultaneously. To evaluate our method’s performance, we conduct extensive experiments on a new well-labeled occupation database with 14 representative occupations and over 7K images. Results on this database validate our method’s effectiveness and show that occupation recognition is solvable in a more general case.</p><p>3 0.87579924 <a title="204-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Dominance%3A_What_Pops_Out%3F.html">53 iccv-2013-Attribute Dominance: What Pops Out?</a></p>

<p>Author: Ziyang Ma, Kaiming He, Yichen Wei, Jian Sun, Enhua Wu</p><p>Abstract: Despite the continuous advances in local stereo matching for years, most efforts are on developing robust cost computation and aggregation methods. Little attention has been seriously paid to the disparity refinement. In this work, we study weighted median filtering for disparity refinement. We discover that with this refinement, even the simple box filter aggregation achieves comparable accuracy with various sophisticated aggregation methods (with the same refinement). This is due to the nice weighted median filtering properties of removing outlier error while respecting edges/structures. This reveals that the previously overlooked refinement can be at least as crucial as aggregation. We also develop the first constant time algorithmfor the previously time-consuming weighted median filter. This makes the simple combination “box aggregation + weighted median ” an attractive solution in practice for both speed and accuracy. As a byproduct, the fast weighted median filtering unleashes its potential in other applications that were hampered by high complexities. We show its superiority in various applications such as depth upsampling, clip-art JPEG artifact removal, and image stylization.</p><p>2 0.92038554 <a title="204-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Higher_Order_Matching_for_Consistent_Multiple_Target_Tracking.html">200 iccv-2013-Higher Order Matching for Consistent Multiple Target Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Chetan Arora, Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the data assignment problem in multi frame multi object tracking in video sequences. Traditional methods employing maximum weight bipartite matching offer limited temporal modeling. It has recently been shown [6, 8, 24] that incorporating higher order temporal constraints improves the assignment solution. Finding maximum weight matching with higher order constraints is however NP-hard and the solutions proposed until now have either been greedy [8] or rely on greedy rounding of the solution obtained from spectral techniques [15]. We propose a novel algorithm to find the approximate solution to data assignment problem with higher order temporal constraints using the method of dual decomposition and the MPLP message passing algorithm [21]. We compare the proposed algorithm with an implementation of [8] and [15] and show that proposed technique provides better solution with a bound on approximation factor for each inferred solution.</p><p>3 0.90966839 <a title="204-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Near-Optimal_Cost-Sensitive_Decision_Policy_for_Object_Detection.html">241 iccv-2013-Learning Near-Optimal Cost-Sensitive Decision Policy for Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Tianfu Wu, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Many object detectors, such as AdaBoost, SVM and deformable part-based models (DPM), compute additive scoring functions at a large number of windows scanned over image pyramid, thus computational efficiency is an important consideration beside accuracy performance. In this paper, we present a framework of learning cost-sensitive decision policy which is a sequence of two-sided thresholds to execute early rejection or early acceptance based on the accumulative scores at each step. A decision policy is said to be optimal if it minimizes an empirical global risk function that sums over the loss of false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP), and the cost of computation. While the risk function is very complex due to high-order connections among the two-sided thresholds, we find its upper bound can be optimized by dynamic programming (DP) efficiently and thus say the learned policy is near-optimal. Given the loss of FN and FP and the cost in three numbers, our method can produce a policy on-the-fly for Adaboost, SVM and DPM. In experiments, we show that our decision policy outperforms state-of-the-art cascade methods significantly in terms of speed with similar accuracy performance.</p><p>4 0.90740609 <a title="204-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Image_Partitioning_Using_Decision_Trees_with_Structured_Split_Criteria.html">448 iccv-2013-Weakly Supervised Learning of Image Partitioning Using Decision Trees with Structured Split Criteria</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph Straehle, Ullrich Koethe, Fred A. Hamprecht</p><p>Abstract: We propose a scheme that allows to partition an image into a previously unknown number of segments, using only minimal supervision in terms of a few must-link and cannotlink annotations. We make no use of regional data terms, learning instead what constitutes a likely boundary between segments. Since boundaries are only implicitly specified through cannot-link constraints, this is a hard and nonconvex latent variable problem. We address this problem in a greedy fashion using a randomized decision tree on features associated with interpixel edges. We use a structured purity criterion during tree construction and also show how a backtracking strategy can be used to prevent the greedy search from ending up in poor local optima. The proposed strategy is compared with prior art on natural images.</p><p>5 0.9057669 <a title="204-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Modifying_the_Memorability_of_Face_Photographs.html">272 iccv-2013-Modifying the Memorability of Face Photographs</a></p>
<p>Author: Aditya Khosla, Wilma A. Bainbridge, Antonio Torralba, Aude Oliva</p><p>Abstract: Contemporary life bombards us with many new images of faces every day, which poses non-trivial constraints on human memory. The vast majority of face photographs are intended to be remembered, either because of personal relevance, commercial interests or because the pictures were deliberately designed to be memorable. Can we make aportrait more memorable or more forgettable automatically? Here, we provide a method to modify the memorability of individual face photographs, while keeping the identity and other facial traits (e.g. age, attractiveness, and emotional magnitude) of the individual fixed. We show that face photographs manipulated to be more memorable (or more forgettable) are indeed more often remembered (or forgotten) in a crowd-sourcing experiment with an accuracy of 74%. Quantifying and modifying the ‘memorability ’ of a face lends itself to many useful applications in computer vision and graphics, such as mnemonic aids for learning, photo editing applications for social networks and tools for designing memorable advertisements.</p><p>6 0.90528852 <a title="204-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Salient_Region_Detection_by_UFO%3A_Uniqueness%2C_Focusness_and_Objectness.html">374 iccv-2013-Salient Region Detection by UFO: Uniqueness, Focusness and Objectness</a></p>

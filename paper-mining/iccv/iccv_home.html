<br/><br/><p>International Conference on Computer Vision
</p><p>
</p><p>ICCV, the International Conference on Computer Vision, is a research conference sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) held every other year. It is considered, together with CVPR, the top level conference in computer vision, with a 'A*' rating from the Australian Ranking of ICT Conferences obtained in 2008. The acceptance rate for ICCV has been around 20%, with about 4% being accepted for oral presentations.
</p><p>
</p><p>Like many IEEE conferences, ICCV has tutorial talks, technical sessions, and poster sessions. The conference is usually spread over four to five days. Leading experts in the focus areas would give tutorial talks on the first day. Then the technical sessions (and poster sessions in parallel) would follow.

</p><p>Azriel Rosenfeld Lifetime Achievement Award
</p><p>
</p><p>The Azriel Rosenfeld Award, or Azriel Rosenfeld Lifetime Achievement Award, recognizes researchers who have made significant contributions to the field of field of computer vision over their careers. It is named in memory of computer scientist and mathematician Azriel Rosenfeld.  Recipients:
</p><p>
</p><p>    Jan Koenderink (2013)
</p><p>    Thomas Huang (2011)
</p><p>    Berthold K.P. Horn (2009)
</p><p>    Takeo Kanade (2007)
</p><p>
</p><p>Helmholtz Prize
</p><p>
</p><p>The ICCV Helmholtz Prize, known as the Test of Time Award before 2013, is awarded every other year at the ICCV, recognizing ICCV papers from ten or more years earlier that had a significant impact on computer vision research. Winners are selected by the IEEE Computer Society's Technical Committee on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TCPAMI). The award is named after the 19th century physician and physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, and the ICCV's award is not related to the various Helmholtz Prizes in physics, or the Hermann von Helmholtz Prize in neuroscience.

</p><p>Marr Prize
</p><p>
</p><p>The best paper of the conference is awarded the Marr Prize, which is one of the top honors for a researcher in computer vision.
</p><p>
</p><p>Mark Everingham Prize
</p><p>
</p><p>The Mark Everingham Prize is an award given yearly by the Technical Committee on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TCPAMI) of the IEEE Computer Society at the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) or the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) to commemorate the late Mark Everingham, “one of the rising stars of computer vision”, and to encourage others to follow in his footsteps by acting to further progress in the computer vision community as a whole. The prize is given to a researcher, or a team of researchers, who have made a selfless contribution of significant benefit to other members of the computer vision community. The Mark Everingham Prize for Rigorous Evaluation was an award given in 2012 at the British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC).

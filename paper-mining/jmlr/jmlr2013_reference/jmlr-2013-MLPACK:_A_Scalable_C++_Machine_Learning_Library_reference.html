<h1>67 jmlr-2013-MLPACK: A Scalable C++ Machine Learning Library</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2013-67-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume14/curtin13a/curtin13a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ryan R. Curtin, James R. Cline, N. P. Slagle, William B. March, Parikshit Ram, Nishant A. Mehta, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: MLPACK is a state-of-the-art, scalable, multi-platform C++ machine learning library released in late 2011 offering both a simple, consistent API accessible to novice users and high performance and ﬂexibility to expert users by leveraging modern features of C++. MLPACK provides cutting-edge algorithms whose benchmarks exhibit far better performance than other leading machine learning libraries. MLPACK version 1.0.3, licensed under the LGPL, is available at http://www.mlpack.org. Keywords: C++, dual-tree algorithms, machine learning software, open source software, largescale learning 1. Introduction and Goals Though several machine learning libraries are freely available online, few, if any, offer efﬁcient algorithms to the average user. For instance, the popular Weka toolkit (Hall et al., 2009) emphasizes ease of use but scales poorly; the distributed Apache Mahout library offers scalability at a cost of higher overhead (such as clusters and powerful servers often unavailable to the average user). Also, few libraries offer breadth; for instance, libsvm (Chang and Lin, 2011) and the Tilburg MemoryBased Learner (TiMBL) are highly scalable and accessible yet each offer only a single method. MLPACK, intended to be the machine learning analog to the general-purpose LAPACK linear algebra library, aims to combine efﬁciency and accessibility. Written in C++, MLPACK uses the highly efﬁcient Armadillo matrix library (Sanderson, 2010) and is freely available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Through the use of C++ templates, MLPACK both eliminates unnecessary copying of data sets and performs expression optimizations unavailable in other languages. Also, MLPACK is, to our knowledge, unique among existing libraries in using generic programming features of C++ to allow customization of the available machine learning methods without incurring performance penalties. c 2013 Ryan R.

Finally, the source code provides references and comprehensive documentation. Four major goals of the development team of MLPACK are • • • • to implement scalable, fast machine learning algorithms, to design an intuitive, consistent, and simple API for non-expert users, to implement a variety of machine learning methods, and to provide cutting-edge machine learning algorithms unavailable elsewhere. This paper offers both an introduction to the simple and extensible API and a glimpse of the superior performance of the library. 2. Package Overview Each algorithm available in MLPACK features both a set of C++ library functions and a standalone command-line executable. Version 1.0.3 includes the following methods: • • • • • • • • • • • • • • nearest/furthest neighbor search with cover trees or kd-trees (k-nearest-neighbors) range search with cover trees or kd-trees Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) hidden Markov models (HMMs) LARS / Lasso regression k-means clustering fast hierarchical clustering (Euclidean MST calculation)1 (March et al., 2010) kernel PCA (and regular PCA) local coordinate coding1 (Yu et al., 2009) sparse coding using dictionary learning RADICAL (Robust, Accurate, Direct ICA aLgorithm) (Learned-Miller and Fisher, 2003) maximum variance unfolding (MVU) via LRSDP1 (Burer and Monteiro, 2003) the naive Bayes classiﬁer density estimation trees1 (Ram and Gray, 2011) The development team manages MLPACK with Subversion and the Trac bug reporting system, allowing easy downloads and simple bug reporting. The entire development process is transparent, so any interested user can easily contribute to the library. MLPACK can compile from source on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows; currently, different Linux distributions are reviewing MLPACK for inclusion in their package managers, which will allow users to install MLPACK without needing to compile from source. 3. A Consistent, Simple API MLPACK features a highly accessible API, both in style (such as consistent naming schemes and coding conventions) and ease of use (such as templated defaults), as well as stringent documentation standards. Consequently, a new user can execute algorithms out-of-the-box often with little or no adjustment to parameters, while the seasoned expert can expect extreme ﬂexibility in algorithmic 1. This algorithm is not available in any other comparable software package. 802 MLPACK: A S CALABLE C++ M ACHINE L EARNING L IBRARY Data Set wine cloud wine-qual isolet miniboone yp-msd corel covtype mnist randu MLPACK 0.0003 0.0069 0.0290 13.0197 20.2045 5430.0478 4.9716 14.3449 2719.8087 1020.9142 Weka 0.0621 0.1174 0.8868 213.4735 216.1469 >9000.0000 14.4264 45.9912 >9000.0000 2665.0921 Shogun 0.0277 0.5000 4.3617 37.6190 2351.4637 >9000.0000 555.9600 >9000.0000 3536.4477 >9000.0000 MATLAB 0.0021 0.0210 0.6465 46.9518 1088.1127 >9000.0000 60.8496 >9000.0000 4838.6747 1679.2893 mlpy 0.0025 0.3520 4.0431 52.0437 3219.2696 >9000.0000 209.5056 >9000.0000 5192.3586 >9000.0000 sklearn 0.0008 0.0192 0.1668 46.8016 714.2385 >9000.0000 160.4597 651.6259 5363.9650 8780.0176 Table 1: k-NN benchmarks (in seconds).

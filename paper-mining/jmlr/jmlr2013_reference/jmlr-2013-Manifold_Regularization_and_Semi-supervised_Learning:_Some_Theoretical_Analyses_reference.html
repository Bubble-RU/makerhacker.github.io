<h1>69 jmlr-2013-Manifold Regularization and Semi-supervised Learning: Some Theoretical Analyses</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2013-69-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume14/niyogi13a/niyogi13a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: Manifold regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) is a geometrically motivated framework for machine learning within which several semi-supervised algorithms have been constructed. Here we try to provide some theoretical understanding of this approach. Our main result is to expose the natural structure of a class of problems on which manifold regularization methods are helpful. We show that for such problems, no supervised learner can learn effectively. On the other hand, a manifold based learner (that knows the manifold or “learns” it from unlabeled examples) can learn with relatively few labeled examples. Our analysis follows a minimax style with an emphasis on ﬁnite sample results (in terms of n: the number of labeled examples). These results allow us to properly interpret manifold regularization and related spectral and geometric algorithms in terms of their potential use in semi-supervised learning. Keywords: semi-supervised learning, manifold regularization, graph Laplacian, minimax rates</p><br/>

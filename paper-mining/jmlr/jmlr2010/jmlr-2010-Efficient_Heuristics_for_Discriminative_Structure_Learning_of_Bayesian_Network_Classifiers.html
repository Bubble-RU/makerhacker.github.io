<p>Author: Jacek P. Dmochowski, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: The presence of asymmetry in the misclassiﬁcation costs or class prevalences is a common occurrence in the pattern classiﬁcation domain. While much interest has been devoted to the study of cost-sensitive learning techniques, the relationship between cost-sensitive learning and the speciﬁcation of the model set in a parametric estimation framework remains somewhat unclear. To that end, we differentiate between the case of the model including the true posterior, and that in which the model is misspeciﬁed. In the former case, it is shown that thresholding the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate is an asymptotically optimal solution to the risk minimization problem. On the other hand, under model misspeciﬁcation, it is demonstrated that thresholded ML is suboptimal and that the risk-minimizing solution varies with the misclassiﬁcation cost ratio. Moreover, we analytically show that the negative weighted log likelihood (Elkan, 2001) is a tight, convex upper bound of the empirical loss. Coupled with empirical results on several real-world data sets, we argue that weighted ML is the preferred cost-sensitive technique.

<p>Author: Shyam Visweswaran, Gregory F. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian algorithm for constructing predictive models from data that are optimized to predict a target variable well for a particular instance. This algorithm learns Markov blanket models, carries out Bayesian model averaging over a set of models to predict a target variable of the instance at hand, and employs an instance-speciﬁc heuristic to locate a set of suitable models to average over. We call this method the instance-speciﬁc Markov blanket (ISMB) algorithm. The ISMB algorithm was evaluated on 21 UCI data sets using ﬁve different performance measures and its performance was compared to that of several commonly used predictive algorithms, including nave Bayes, C4.5 decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks, k-Nearest Neighbor, Lazy Bayesian Rules, and AdaBoost. Over all the data sets, the ISMB algorithm performed better on average on all performance measures against all the comparison algorithms.

<p>Author: Joshua W. Robinson, Alexander J. Hartemink</p><p>Abstract: Learning dynamic Bayesian network structures provides a principled mechanism for identifying conditional dependencies in time-series data. An important assumption of traditional DBN structure learning is that the data are generated by a stationary process, an assumption that is not true in many important settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of graphical model called a nonstationary dynamic Bayesian network, in which the conditional dependence structure of the underlying data-generation process is permitted to change over time. Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks represent a new framework for studying problems in which the structure of a network is evolving over time. Some examples of evolving networks are transcriptional regulatory networks during an organism’s development, neural pathways during learning, and trafﬁc patterns during the day. We deﬁne the non-stationary DBN model, present an MCMC sampling algorithm for learning the structure of the model from time-series data under different assumptions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on both simulated and biological data.

<p>Author: Yin-Wen Chang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Kai-Wei Chang, Michael Ringgaard, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Kernel techniques have long been used in SVM to handle linearly inseparable problems by transforming data to a high dimensional space, but training and testing large data sets is often time consuming. In contrast, we can efﬁciently train and test much larger data sets using linear SVM without kernels. In this work, we apply fast linear-SVM methods to the explicit form of polynomially mapped data and investigate implementation issues. The approach enjoys fast training and testing, but may sometimes achieve accuracy close to that of using highly nonlinear kernels. Empirical experiments show that the proposed method is useful for certain large-scale data sets. We successfully apply the proposed method to a natural language processing (NLP) application by improving the testing accuracy under some training/testing speed requirements.

<p>Author: Ming Yuan</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating a high dimensional inverse covariance matrix that can be well approximated by “sparse” matrices. Taking advantage of the connection between multivariate linear regression and entries of the inverse covariance matrix, we propose an estimating procedure that can effectively exploit such “sparsity”. The proposed method can be computed using linear programming and therefore has the potential to be used in very high dimensional problems. Oracle inequalities are established for the estimation error in terms of several operator norms, showing that the method is adaptive to different types of sparsity of the problem.

<p>Author: Jörg Lücke, Julian Eggert</p><p>Abstract: We show how a preselection of hidden variables can be used to efﬁciently train generative models with binary hidden variables. The approach is based on Expectation Maximization (EM) and uses an efﬁciently computable approximation to the sufﬁcient statistics of a given model. The computational cost to compute the sufﬁcient statistics is strongly reduced by selecting, for each data point, the relevant hidden causes. The approximation is applicable to a wide range of generative models and provides an interpretation of the beneﬁts of preselection in terms of a variational EM approximation. To empirically show that the method maximizes the data likelihood, it is applied to different types of generative models including: a version of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), a model for non-linear component extraction (MCA), and a linear generative model similar to sparse coding. The derived algorithms are applied to both artiﬁcial and realistic data, and are compared to other models in the literature. We ﬁnd that the training scheme can reduce computational costs by orders of magnitude and allows for a reliable extraction of hidden causes.

<p>Author: Franz Pernkopf, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a simple order-based greedy heuristic for learning discriminative structure within generative Bayesian network classiﬁers. We propose two methods for establishing an order of N features. They are based on the conditional mutual information and classiﬁcation rate (i.e., risk), respectively. Given an ordering, we can ﬁnd a discriminative structure with O N k+1 score evaluations (where constant k is the tree-width of the sub-graph over the attributes). We present results on 25 data sets from the UCI repository, for phonetic classiﬁcation using the TIMIT database, for a visual surface inspection task, and for two handwritten digit recognition tasks. We provide classiﬁcation performance for both discriminative and generative parameter learning on both discriminatively and generatively structured networks. The discriminative structure found by our new procedures signiﬁcantly outperforms generatively produced structures, and achieves a classiﬁcation accuracy on par with the best discriminative (greedy) Bayesian network learning approach, but does so with a factor of ∼10-40 speedup. We also show that the advantages of generative discriminatively structured Bayesian network classiﬁers still hold in the case of missing features, a case where generative classiﬁers have an advantage over discriminative classiﬁers.

<p>Author: Patrick O. Perry, Art B. Owen</p><p>Abstract: In multivariate regression models we have the opportunity to look for hidden structure unrelated to the observed predictors. However, when one ﬁts a model involving such latent variables it is important to be able to tell if the structure is real, or just an artifact of correlation in the regression errors. We develop a new statistical test based on random rotations for verifying the existence of latent variables. The rotations are carefully constructed to rotate orthogonally to the column space of the regression model. We ﬁnd that only non-Gaussian latent variables are detectable, a ﬁnding that parallels a well known phenomenon in independent components analysis. We base our test on a measure of non-Gaussianity in the histogram of the principal eigenvector components instead of on the eigenvalue. The method ﬁnds and veriﬁes some latent dichotomies in the microarray data from the AGEMAP consortium.

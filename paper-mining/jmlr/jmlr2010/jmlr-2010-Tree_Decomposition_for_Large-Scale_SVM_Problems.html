<p>Author: Yin-Wen Chang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Kai-Wei Chang, Michael Ringgaard, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Kernel techniques have long been used in SVM to handle linearly inseparable problems by transforming data to a high dimensional space, but training and testing large data sets is often time consuming. In contrast, we can efﬁciently train and test much larger data sets using linear SVM without kernels. In this work, we apply fast linear-SVM methods to the explicit form of polynomially mapped data and investigate implementation issues. The approach enjoys fast training and testing, but may sometimes achieve accuracy close to that of using highly nonlinear kernels. Empirical experiments show that the proposed method is useful for certain large-scale data sets.

<p>Author: Nicola Segata, Enrico Blanzieri</p><p>Abstract: A computationally efﬁcient approach to local learning with kernel methods is presented. The Fast Local Kernel Support Vector Machine (FaLK-SVM) trains a set of local SVMs on redundant neighbourhoods in the training set and an appropriate model for each query point is selected at testing time according to a proximity strategy. Supported by a recent result by Zakai and Ritov (2009) relating consistency and localizability, our approach achieves high classiﬁcation accuracies by dividing the separation function in local optimisation problems that can be handled very efﬁciently from the computational viewpoint. The introduction of a fast local model selection further speeds-up the learning process. Learning and complexity bounds are derived for FaLK-SVM, and the empirical evaluation of the approach (with data sets up to 3 million points) showed that it is much faster and more accurate and scalable than state-of-the-art accurate and approximated SVM solvers at least for non high-dimensional data sets. More generally, we show that locality can be an important factor to sensibly speed-up learning approaches and kernel methods, differently from other recent techniques that tend to dismiss local information in order to improve scalability.

<p>Author: Pedro A. Forero, Alfonso Cano, Georgios B. Giannakis</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops algorithms to train support vector machines when training data are distributed across different nodes, and their communication to a centralized processing unit is prohibited due to, for example, communication complexity, scalability, or privacy reasons. To accomplish this goal, the centralized linear SVM problem is cast as a set of decentralized convex optimization subproblems (one per node) with consensus constraints on the wanted classiﬁer parameters. Using the alternating direction method of multipliers, fully distributed training algorithms are obtained without exchanging training data among nodes. Different from existing incremental approaches, the overhead associated with inter-node communications is ﬁxed and solely dependent on the network topology rather than the size of the training sets available per node. Important generalizations to train nonlinear SVMs in a distributed fashion are also developed along with sequential variants capable of online processing. Simulated tests illustrate the performance of the novel algorithms.1 Keywords: support vector machine, distributed optimization, distributed data mining, distributed learning, sensor networks</p><p>5 0.034022208 <a title="113-tfidf-5" href="./jmlr-2010-Maximum_Relative_Margin_and_Data-Dependent_Regularization.html">74 jmlr-2010-Maximum Relative Margin and Data-Dependent Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Pannagadatta K. Shivaswamy, Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: Leading classiﬁcation methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) and their counterparts achieve strong generalization performance by maximizing the margin of separation between data classes. While the maximum margin approach has achieved promising performance, this article identiﬁes its sensitivity to afﬁne transformations of the data and to directions with large data spread. Maximum margin solutions may be misled by the spread of data and preferentially separate classes along large spread directions. This article corrects these weaknesses by measuring margin not in the absolute sense but rather only relative to the spread of data in any projection direction. Maximum relative margin corresponds to a data-dependent regularization on the classiﬁcation function while maximum absolute margin corresponds to an ℓ2 norm constraint on the classiﬁcation function. Interestingly, the proposed improvements only require simple extensions to existing maximum margin formulations and preserve the computational efﬁciency of SVMs. Through the maximization of relative margin, surprising performance gains are achieved on real-world problems such as digit, text classiﬁcation and on several other benchmark data sets. In addition, risk bounds are derived for the new formulation based on Rademacher averages.

<p>Author: Joshua V. Dillon, Guy Lebanon</p><p>Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimators are often of limited practical use due to the intensive computation they require. We propose a family of alternative estimators that maximize a stochastic variation of the composite likelihood function. Each of the estimators resolve the computation-accuracy tradeoff differently, and taken together they span a continuous spectrum of computation-accuracy tradeoff resolutions. We prove the consistency of the estimators, provide formulas for their asymptotic variance, statistical robustness, and computational complexity. We discuss experimental results in the context of Boltzmann machines and conditional random ﬁelds. The theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimators when the computational resources are insufﬁcient. They also demonstrate that in some cases reduced computational complexity is associated with robustness thereby increasing statistical accuracy.

While the maximum margin approach has achieved promising performance, this article identiﬁes its sensitivity to afﬁne transformations of the data and to directions with large data spread. Maximum margin solutions may be misled by the spread of data and preferentially separate classes along large spread directions. This article corrects these weaknesses by measuring margin not in the absolute sense but rather only relative to the spread of data in any projection direction. Maximum relative margin corresponds to a data-dependent regularization on the classiﬁcation function while maximum absolute margin corresponds to an ℓ2 norm constraint on the classiﬁcation function. Interestingly, the proposed improvements only require simple extensions to existing maximum margin formulations and preserve the computational efﬁciency of SVMs. Through the maximization of relative margin, surprising performance gains are achieved on real-world problems such as digit, text classiﬁcation and on several other benchmark data sets. In addition, risk bounds are derived for the new formulation based on Rademacher averages.

<p>Author: Gideon S. Mann, Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an overview of generalized expectation criteria (GE), a simple, robust, scalable method for semi-supervised training using weakly-labeled data. GE ﬁts model parameters by favoring models that match certain expectation constraints, such as marginal label distributions, on the unlabeled data. This paper shows how to apply generalized expectation criteria to two classes of parametric models: maximum entropy models and conditional random ﬁelds. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements over supervised training and a number of other stateof-the-art semi-supervised learning methods for these models.

<p>Author: Ido Cohn, Tal El-Hay, Nir Friedman, Raz Kupferman</p><p>Abstract: Continuous-time Bayesian networks is a natural structured representation language for multicomponent stochastic processes that evolve continuously over time. Despite the compact representation provided by this language, inference in such models is intractable even in relatively simple structured networks. We introduce a mean ﬁeld variational approximation in which we use a product of inhomogeneous Markov processes to approximate a joint distribution over trajectories. This variational approach leads to a globally consistent distribution, which can be efﬁciently queried. Additionally, it provides a lower bound on the probability of observations, thus making it attractive for learning tasks. Here we describe the theoretical foundations for the approximation, an efﬁcient implementation that exploits the wide range of highly optimized ordinary differential equations (ODE) solvers, experimentally explore characterizations of processes for which this approximation is suitable, and show applications to a large-scale real-world inference problem.

<p>Author: Marina Meilă, Le Bao</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a statistical model for expressing preferences through rankings, when the number of alternatives (items to rank) is large. A human ranker will then typically rank only the most preferred items, and may not even examine the whole set of items, or know how many they are. Similarly, a user presented with the ranked output of a search engine, will only consider the highest ranked items. We model such situations by introducing a stagewise ranking model that operates with ﬁnite ordered lists called top-t orderings over an inﬁnite space of items. We give algorithms to estimate this model from data, and demonstrate that it has sufﬁcient statistics, being thus an exponential family model with continuous and discrete parameters. We describe its conjugate prior and other statistical properties. Then, we extend the estimation problem to multimodal data by introducing an Exponential-Blurring-Mean-Shift nonparametric clustering algorithm. The experiments highlight the properties of our model and demonstrate that inﬁnite models over permutations can be simple, elegant and practical.

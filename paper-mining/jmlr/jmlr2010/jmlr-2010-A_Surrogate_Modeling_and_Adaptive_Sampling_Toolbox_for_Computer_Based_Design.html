<h1>8 jmlr-2010-A Surrogate Modeling and Adaptive Sampling Toolbox for Computer Based Design</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2010-8-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume11/gorissen10a/gorissen10a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Dirk Gorissen, Ivo Couckuyt, Piet Demeester, Tom Dhaene, Karel Crombecq</p><p>Abstract: An exceedingly large number of scientiﬁc and engineering ﬁelds are confronted with the need for computer simulations to study complex, real world phenomena or solve challenging design problems. However, due to the computational cost of these high ﬁdelity simulations, the use of neural networks, kernel methods, and other surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable. Surrogate models are compact and cheap to evaluate, and have proven very useful for tasks such as optimization, design space exploration, prototyping, and sensitivity analysis. Consequently, in many ﬁelds there is great interest in tools and techniques that facilitate the construction of such regression models, while minimizing the computational cost and maximizing model accuracy. This paper presents a mature, ﬂexible, and adaptive machine learning toolkit for regression modeling and active learning to tackle these issues. The toolkit brings together algorithms for data ﬁtting, model selection, sample selection (active learning), hyperparameter optimization, and distributed computing in order to empower a domain expert to efﬁciently generate an accurate model for the problem or data at hand. Keywords: surrogate modeling, metamodeling, function approximation, model selection, adaptive sampling, active learning, distributed computing 1. Background and Motivation In many science and engineering problems researchers make heavy use of computer simulation codes in order to replace expensive physical experiments and improve the quality and performance of engineered products and devices. Such simulation activities are collectively referred to as computational science/engineering. Unfortunately, while allowing scientists more ﬂexibility to study phenomena under controlled conditions, computer simulations require a substantial investment of c 2010 Dirk Gorissen, Ivo Couckuyt, Piet Demeester, Tom Dhaene and Karel Crombecq. G ORISSEN , C OUCKUYT, D EMEESTER , D HAENE AND C ROMBECQ computation time. One simulation may take many minutes, hours, days or even weeks, quickly rendering parameter studies impractical (Forrester et al., 2008; Simpson et al., 2008). Of the different ways to deal with this problem, this paper is concerned with the construction of simpler approximation models to predict the system performance and develop a relationship between the system inputs and outputs. When properly constructed, these approximation models mimic the behavior of the simulation accurately while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Different approximation methods exist, each with their relative merits. This work concentrates on the use of data-driven, global approximations using compact surrogate models (also known as metamodels, replacement models, or response surface models). Examples include: rational functions, Kriging models, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN), splines, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Once such a global approximation is available it is of great use for gaining insight into the behavior of the underlying system. The surrogate may be easily queried, optimized, visualized, and seamlessly integrated into CAD/CAE software packages. The challenge is thus how to generate an approximation model that is as accurate as possible over the complete domain of interest while minimizing the simulation cost. Solving this challenge involves multiple sub-problems that must be addressed: how to interface with the simulation code, how to run simulations (locally, or on a cluster or cloud), which model type to approximate the data with and how to set the model complexity (e.g., topology of a neural network), how to estimate the model quality and ensure the domain expert trusts the model, how to decide which simulations to run (data collection), etc. The data collection aspect is worth emphasizing. Since data is computationally expensive to obtain and the optimal data distribution is not known up front, data points should be selected iteratively, there where the information gain will be the greatest. A sampling function is needed that minimizes the number of sample points selected in each iteration, yet maximizes the information gain of each iteration step. This process is called adaptive sampling but is also known as active learning, or sequential design. There is a complex dependency web between these different options and dealing with these dependencies is non-trivial, particularly for a domain expert for whom the surrogate model is just an intermediate step towards solving a larger, more important problem. Few domain experts will be experts in the intricacies of efﬁcient sampling and modeling strategies. Their primary concern is obtaining an accurate replacement metamodel for their problem as fast as possible and with minimal overhead (Gorissen et al., 2009d). As a result these choices are often made in a pragmatic, sometimes even ad-hoc, manner. This paper discusses an advanced, and integrated software framework that provides a ﬂexible and rigorous means to tackle such problems. This work lies at the intersection of Machine Learning/AI, Modeling and Simulation, and Distributed Computing. The methods developed are applicable to any domain where a cheap, accurate, approximation is needed to replace some expensive reference model. Our experience has been that the availability of such a framework can facilitate the transfer of knowledge from surrogate modeling researchers and lower the barrier of entry for domain experts. 2. SUMO Toolbox The platform in question is the Matlab SUrrogate MOdeling (SUMO) Toolbox, illustrated in Figure 1. Given a simulation engine (Fluent, Cadence, Abaqus, HFSS, etc.) or other data source (data 2052 A S URROGATE M ODELING AND A DAPTIVE S AMPLING TOOLBOX FOR C OMPUTER BASED D ESIGN Figure 1: The SUMO Toolbox is a ﬂexible framework for accurate global surrogate modeling and adaptive sampling (active learning). It features a rich set of plugins, is applicable to a wide range of domains, and can be applied in an autonomous, black-box fashion, or under full manual control. Written in Matlab and Java it is fully cross platform and comes with a large (60+) number of example problems. set, Matlab script, Java class, etc.), the toolbox drives the data source to produce a surrogate model within the time and accuracy constraints set by the user. The SUMO Toolbox adopts a microkernel design philosophy with many different plugins available for each of the different sub-problems:1 model types (rational functions, Kriging, splines, SVM, ANN, etc.), hyperparameter optimization algorithms (Particle Swarm Optimization, Efﬁcient Global Optimization, simulated annealing, Genetic Algorithm, etc.), model selection algorithms (cross validation, AIC, Leave-out set, etc.), sample selection (random, error based, density based, hybrid, etc.), Design of Experiments (Latin hypercube, Box-Bhenken, etc.), and sample evaluation methods (local, on a cluster or grid). The behavior of each software component is conﬁgurable through a central XML ﬁle and components can easily be added, removed or replaced by custom implementations. In addition the toolbox provides ‘meta’ plugins. For example to automatically select the best model type for a given problem (Gorissen et al., 2009d) or to use multiple model selection or sample selection criteria in concert (Gorissen et al., 2010). Furthermore, there is built-in support for high performance computing. On the modeling side, the model generation process can take full advantage of multi-core CPUs and even of a complete cluster or grid. This can result in signiﬁcant speedups for model types where the ﬁtting process can be expensive (e.g., neural networks). Likewise, sample evaluation (simulation) can occur locally (with the option to take advantage of multi-core architectures) or on a separate compute cluster or grid (possibly accessed through a remote head-node). All interfacing with the grid middleware 1. The full list of plugins and features can be found at http://www.sumowiki.intec.ugent.be. 2053 G ORISSEN , C OUCKUYT, D EMEESTER , D HAENE AND C ROMBECQ (submission, job monitoring, rescheduling of failed/lost simulation points, etc.) is handled transparently and automatically (see Gorissen et al., 2009c for more details). Also, the sample evaluation component runs in parallel with the other components (non-blocking) and not sequentially. This allows for an optimal use of computational resources. In addition the SUMO Toolbox contains extensive logging and proﬁling capabilities so that the modeling process can easily be tracked and the modeling decisions understood. Once a ﬁnal model has been generated, a GUI tool is available to visually explore the model (including derivatives and prediction uncertainty), assess its quality, and export it for use in other software tools. 3. Applications The SUMO Toolbox has already been applied successfully to a very wide range of applications, including RF circuit block modeling (Gorissen et al., 2009b), hydrological modeling (Couckuyt et al., 2009), Electronic Packaging (Zhu and Franzon, 2009), aerodynamic modeling (Gorissen et al., 2009a), process engineering (Stephens et al., 2009), and automotive data modeling (Gorissen et al., 2010). Besides global modeling capabilities, the SUMO Toolbox also includes a powerful optimization framework based on the Efﬁcient Global Optimization framework developed by Jones et al. (1998). As of version 6.1, the toolbox also contains an example of how the framework can also be applied to solve classiﬁcation problems. In sum, the goal of the toolbox is to ﬁll the void in machine learning software when it comes to the challenging, costly, real-valued, problems faced in computational engineering. The toolbox is in use successfully at various institutions and we are continuously reﬁning and extending the set of available plugins as the number of applications increase.

<p>Author: Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: We study losses for binary classiﬁcation and class probability estimation and extend the understanding of them from margin losses to general composite losses which are the composition of a proper loss with a link function. We characterise when margin losses can be proper composite losses, explicitly show how to determine a symmetric loss in full from half of one of its partial losses, introduce an intrinsic parametrisation of composite binary losses and give a complete characterisation of the relationship between proper losses and “classiﬁcation calibrated” losses. We also consider the question of the “best” surrogate binary loss. We introduce a precise notion of “best” and show there exist situations where two convex surrogate losses are incommensurable. We provide a complete explicit characterisation of the convexity of composite binary losses in terms of the link function and the weight function associated with the proper loss which make up the composite loss. This characterisation suggests new ways of “surrogate tuning” as well as providing an explicit characterisation of when Bregman divergences on the unit interval are convex in their second argument. Finally, in an appendix we present some new algorithm-independent results on the relationship between properness, convexity and robustness to misclassiﬁcation noise for binary losses and show that all convex proper losses are non-robust to misclassiﬁcation noise.

<p>Author: Carl Edward Rasmussen, Hannes Nickisch</p><p>Abstract: The GPML toolbox provides a wide range of functionality for Gaussian process (GP) inference and prediction. GPs are speciﬁed by mean and covariance functions; we offer a library of simple mean and covariance functions and mechanisms to compose more complex ones. Several likelihood functions are supported including Gaussian and heavy-tailed for regression as well as others suitable for classiﬁcation. Finally, a range of inference methods is provided, including exact and variational inference, Expectation Propagation, and Laplace’s method dealing with non-Gaussian likelihoods and FITC for dealing with large regression tasks. Keywords: Gaussian processes, nonparametric Bayes, probabilistic regression and classiﬁcation Gaussian processes (GPs) (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) have convenient properties for many modelling tasks in machine learning and statistics. They can be used to specify distributions over functions without having to commit to a speciﬁc functional form. Applications range from regression over classiﬁcation to reinforcement learning, spatial models, survival and other time series1 models. Predictions of GP models come with a natural conﬁdence measure: predictive error-bars. Although the implementation of the basic principles in the simplest case is straight forward, various complicating features are often desired in practice. For example, a GP is determined by a mean function and a covariance function, but these functions are mostly difﬁcult to specify fully a priori, and typically they are given in terms of hyperparameters, that is, parameters which have to be inferred. Another source of difﬁculty is the likelihood function. For Gaussian likelihoods, inference is analytically tractable; however, in many tasks, Gaussian likelihoods are not appropriate, and approximate inference methods such as Expectation Propagation (EP) (Minka, 2001), Laplace’s approximation (LA) (Williams and Barber, 1998) and variational bounds (VB) (Gibbs and MacKay, 2000) become necessary (Nickisch and Rasmussen, 2008). In case of large training data, approximations (Candela and Rasmussen, 2005) like FITC (Snelson and Ghahramani, 2006) are needed. The GPML toolbox is designed to overcome these hurdles with its variety of mean, covariance and likelihood functions as well as inference methods, while being simple to use and easy to extend. ∗.

Implementation The GPML toolbox can be obtained from http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/ and also http://mloss.org/software/view/263/ under the FreeBSD license. Based on simple interfaces for covariance, mean, likelihood functions as well as inference methods, we offer full compatibility to both Matlab 7.x2 and GNU Octave 3.2.x.3 Special attention has been given to properly disentangle covariance, likelihood and mean hyperparameters. Also, care has been taken to avoid numerical inaccuracies, for example, safe likelihood evaluations for extreme inputs and stable matrix operations. For example, the covariance matrix K can become numerically close to singular making its naive inversion numerically unsafe. We handle these situations in a principled way4 such that Cholesky decompositions are computed of well-conditioned matrices only. As a result, our code shows a high level of robustness along the full spectrum of possible hyperparameters. The focus of the toolbox is on approximate inference using dense matrix algebra. We currently do not support covariance matrix approximation techniques to deal with large numbers of training examples n. Looking at the (growing) body of literature on sparse approximations, this knowledge is still somewhat in ﬂux, and consensus on the best approaches has not yet been reached. We provide stable and modular code checked by an exhaustive suite of test cases. A single function gp.m serves as main interface to the user—it can make inference and predictions and allows the mean, covariance and likelihood function as well as the inference methods to be speciﬁed freely. Furthermore, gp.m enables convenient learning of the hyperparameters by maximising the log marginal likelihood ln Z. One of the particularly appealing properties of GP models is that principled and practical approaches exist for learning the parameters of mean, covariance and likelihood functions. Good adaptation of such parameters can be essential to obtain both high quality predictions and insights into the properties of the data. The GPML toolbox is particularly ﬂexible, including a large library of different covariance and mean functions, and ﬂexible ways to combine these into more expressive, specialised functions. The user can choose between two gradient-based optimisers: one uses conjugate gradients (CG)5 and the other one relies on a quasi-Newton scheme.6 ∂ Computing the derivatives w.r.t. hyperparameters ∂θi ln Z with gp.m does not need any extra programming effort; every inference method automatically collects the respective derivatives from the mean, covariance and likelihood functions and passes them to gp.m. Our documentation comes in two pieces: a hypertext user documentation7 doc/index.html with examples and code browsing and a technical documentation8 doc/manual.pdf focusing on the interfaces and more technical issues. A casual user will use the hypertext document to quickly get his data analysed, however a power user will consult the pdf document once he wants to include his own mean, covariance, likelihood and inference routines or learn about implementation details. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

The GPML Toolbox We illustrate the modular structure of the GPML toolbox by means of a simple code example. GPs are used to formalise and update knowledge about distributions over functions. A GP prior distribution on an unknown latent function f ∼ GP (mφ (x), kψ (x, x′ )), consists of a mean function m(x) = E[ f (x)], and a covariance function k(x, x) = E[( f (x) − m(x))( f (x′ ) − m(x′ ))], both of which typically contain hyperparameters φ and ψ, which we want to ﬁt in the light of data. We generally assume independent observations, that is, input/output pairs (xi , yi ) of f with joint likelihood Pρ (y|f) = ∏n Pρ (yi | f (xi )) factorising over cases. Finally, after speciﬁcation of the prior and i=1 ﬁtting of the hyperparameters θ = {φ, ψ, ρ}, we wish to compute predictive distributions for test cases. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 % 1) SET UP THE GP : COVARIANCE ; MEAN , LIKELIHOOD , INFERENCE METHOD mf = { ’ meanSum ’ ,{ ’ meanLinear ’, @meanConst }}; a = 2; b = 1; % m(x) = a*x+b cf = { ’ covSEiso ’}; sf = 1; ell = 0.7; % squared exponential covariance funct lf = ’ likLaplace ’; sn = 0.2; % assume Laplace noise with variance sn ˆ2 hyp0 . mean = [a;b ]; hyp0 . cov = log([ ell ; sf ]); hyp0 . lik = log( sn ); % hypers inf = ’ infEP ’; % specify expectation propagation as inference method % 2) MINIMISE NEGATIVE LOG MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD nlZ wrt . hyp ; do 50 CG steps Ncg = 50; [hyp , nlZ ] = minimize ( hyp0 , ’gp ’, -Ncg , inf , mf , cf , lf , X , y ); % 3) PREDICT AT UNKNOWN TEST INPUTS [ymu , ys2 ] = gp (hyp , inf , mf , cf , lf , X , y , Xs ); % test input Xs In line 1, we specify the mean mφ (x) = a⊤ x + b of the GP with hyperparameters φ = {a, b}. First, the functional form of the mean function is given and its parameters are initialised. The desired mean function, happens not to exist in the library of mean functions; instead we have to make a composite mean function from simple constituents. This is done using a nested cell array containing the algebraic expression for m(x): As the sum of a linear (mean/meanLinear.m) and a constant mean function (mean/meanConst.m) it is an afﬁne function. In addition to linear and constant mean functions, the toolbox offers m(x) = 0 and m(x) = 1. These simple mean functions can be combined by composite mean functions to obtain sums (mean/meanSum.m) m(x) = ∑ j m j (x), products m(x) = ∏ j m j (x), scaled versions m(x) = αm0 (x) and powers m(x) = m0 (x)d . This ﬂexible mechanism is used for convenient speciﬁcation of an extensible algebra of mean functions. Note that functions are referred to either as name strings ’meanConst’ or alternatively function handles @meanConst. The order of components of the hyperparameters φ is the same as in the speciﬁcation of the cell array. Every mean function implements its evaluation m = mφ (X) and ﬁrst derivative ∂ computation mi = ∂φi mφ (X) on a data set X. In the same spirit, the squared exponential covariance kψ (x, x′ ) = σ f ² exp(− x − x′ 2 /2ℓ2 ) (cov/covSEiso.m) with hyperparameters ψ = {ln ℓ, ln σ f } is set up in line 2. Note, that the hyperparameters are represented by the logarithms, as these parameters are naturally positive. Many other simple covariance functions are contained in the toolbox. Among others, we offer linear, constant, Mat´ rn, rational quadratic, polynomial, periodic, neural network and ﬁnite support coe variance functions. Composite covariance functions allow for sums k(x, x′ ) = ∑ j k j (x, x′ ), products k(x, x′ ) = ∏ j k j (x, x′ ), positive scaling k(x, x′ ) = σ2 k0 (x, x′ ) and masking of components f k(x, x′ ) = k0 (xI , x′ ) with I ⊆ [1, 2, .., D], x ∈ RD . Again, the interface is simple since only the I ∂ evaluation of the covariance matrix K = kψ (X) and its derivatives ∂i K = ∂ψi kψ (X) on a data set X are required. Furthermore, we need cross terms k∗ = kψ (X, x∗ ) and k∗∗ = kψ (x∗ , x∗ ) for prediction. There are no restrictions on the composition of both mean and covariance functions—any combination is allowed including nested composition. 3013 R ASMUSSEN AND N ICKISCH √ √ The Laplace (lik/likLaplace.m) likelihood Pρ (y| f ) = exp(− 2/σn |y − f |)/ 2σn with hyperparameters ρ = {ln σn } is speciﬁed in line 3. There are only simple likelihood functions: Gaussian, Sech-squared, Laplacian and Student’s t for ordinary and sparse regression as well as the error and the logistic function for classiﬁcation. Again, the same inference code is used for any likelihood function. Although the speciﬁcation of likelihood functions is simple for the user, writing new likelihood functions is slightly more involved as different inference methods require access to different properties; for example, LA requires second derivatives and EP requires derivatives of moments. All hyperparameters θ = {φ, ψ, ρ} are stored in a struct hyp.{mean,cov,lik}, which is initialised in line 4; we select the approximate inference algorithm EP (inf/infEP.m) in line 5. We optimise the hyperparameters θ ≡ hyp by calling the CG optimiser (util/minimize.m) with initial value θ0 ≡ hyp0 in line 6 allowing at most N = 50 evaluations of the EP approximation to the marginal likelihood ZEP (θ) as done by gp.m. Here, D = (X, y) ≡ (X,y) is the training data where X = {x1 , .., xn } and y ∈ Rn . Under the hood, gp.m computes in every step a Gaussian ∂ posterior approximation and the derivatives ∂θ ln ZEP (θ) of the marginal likelihood by calling EP. Predictions with optimised hyperparameters are done in line 7, where we call gp.m with the unseen test inputs X∗ ≡ Xs as additional argument. As a result, we obtain the approximate marginal predictive mean E[P(y∗ |D , X∗ )] ≡ ymu and the predictive variance V[P(y∗ |D , X∗ )] ≡ ys2.

Exact inference and the FITC approximation support the Gaussian likelihood only. Variational Bayesian (VB) inference is applicable to all likelihoods. Expectation propagation (EP) for the Student’s t likelihood is inherently unstable due to its non-log-concavity. The Laplace approximation (LA) for Laplace likelihoods is not sensible due to the non-differentiable peak of the Laplace likelihood. Special care has been taken for the non-convex optimisation problem imposed by the combination Student’s t likelihood and LA. If the number of training examples is larger than a few thousand, dense matrix computations become too slow. We provide the FITC approximation for regression with Gaussian likelihood where ˜ instead of the exact covariance matrix K, a low-rank plus diagonal matrix K = Q + diag(K − Q) ⊤ K−1 K is used. The matrices K and K contain covariances and cross-covariances where Q = Ku uu u uu u of and between inducing inputs ui and data points x j . Using inf/infFITC.m together with any covariance function wrapped into cov/covFITC.m makes the computations feasible for large n.

<p>Author: Sören Sonnenburg, Gunnar Rätsch, Sebastian Henschel, Christian Widmer, Jonas Behr, Alexander Zien, Fabio de Bona, Alexander Binder, Christian Gehl, Vojtěch Franc</p><p>Abstract: We have developed a machine learning toolbox, called SHOGUN, which is designed for uniﬁed large-scale learning for a broad range of feature types and learning settings. It offers a considerable number of machine learning models such as support vector machines, hidden Markov models, multiple kernel learning, linear discriminant analysis, and more. Most of the speciﬁc algorithms are able to deal with several different data classes. We have used this toolbox in several applications from computational biology, some of them coming with no less than 50 million training examples and others with 7 billion test examples. With more than a thousand installations worldwide, SHOGUN is already widely adopted in the machine learning community and beyond.

<p>Author: Isabelle Guyon, Amir Saffari, Gideon Dror, Gavin Cawley</p><p>Abstract: The principle of parsimony also known as “Ockham’s razor” has inspired many theories of model selection. Yet such theories, all making arguments in favor of parsimony, are based on very different premises and have developed distinct methodologies to derive algorithms. We have organized challenges and edited a special issue of JMLR and several conference proceedings around the theme of model selection. In this editorial, we revisit the problem of avoiding overﬁtting in light of the latest results. We note the remarkable convergence of theories as different as Bayesian theory, Minimum Description Length, bias/variance tradeoff, Structural Risk Minimization, and regularization, in some approaches. We also present new and interesting examples of the complementarity of theories leading to hybrid algorithms, neither frequentist, nor Bayesian, or perhaps both frequentist and Bayesian!

<p>Author: Dirk Gorissen, Ivo Couckuyt, Piet Demeester, Tom Dhaene, Karel Crombecq</p><p>Abstract: An exceedingly large number of scientiﬁc and engineering ﬁelds are confronted with the need for computer simulations to study complex, real world phenomena or solve challenging design problems. However, due to the computational cost of these high ﬁdelity simulations, the use of neural networks, kernel methods, and other surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable. Surrogate models are compact and cheap to evaluate, and have proven very useful for tasks such as optimization, design space exploration, prototyping, and sensitivity analysis. Consequently, in many ﬁelds there is great interest in tools and techniques that facilitate the construction of such regression models, while minimizing the computational cost and maximizing model accuracy. This paper presents a mature, ﬂexible, and adaptive machine learning toolkit for regression modeling and active learning to tackle these issues. The toolkit brings together algorithms for data ﬁtting, model selection, sample selection (active learning), hyperparameter optimization, and distributed computing in order to empower a domain expert to efﬁciently generate an accurate model for the problem or data at hand. Keywords: surrogate modeling, metamodeling, function approximation, model selection, adaptive sampling, active learning, distributed computing 1. Background and Motivation In many science and engineering problems researchers make heavy use of computer simulation codes in order to replace expensive physical experiments and improve the quality and performance of engineered products and devices. Such simulation activities are collectively referred to as computational science/engineering. Unfortunately, while allowing scientists more ﬂexibility to study phenomena under controlled conditions, computer simulations require a substantial investment of c 2010 Dirk Gorissen, Ivo Couckuyt, Piet Demeester, Tom Dhaene and Karel Crombecq. G ORISSEN , C OUCKUYT, D EMEESTER , D HAENE AND C ROMBECQ computation time. One simulation may take many minutes, hours, days or even weeks, quickly rendering parameter studies impractical (Forrester et al., 2008; Simpson et al., 2008). Of the different ways to deal with this problem, this paper is concerned with the construction of simpler approximation models to predict the system performance and develop a relationship between the system inputs and outputs. When properly constructed, these approximation models mimic the behavior of the simulation accurately while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Different approximation methods exist, each with their relative merits. This work concentrates on the use of data-driven, global approximations using compact surrogate models (also known as metamodels, replacement models, or response surface models). Examples include: rational functions, Kriging models, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN), splines, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Once such a global approximation is available it is of great use for gaining insight into the behavior of the underlying system. The surrogate may be easily queried, optimized, visualized, and seamlessly integrated into CAD/CAE software packages. The challenge is thus how to generate an approximation model that is as accurate as possible over the complete domain of interest while minimizing the simulation cost. Solving this challenge involves multiple sub-problems that must be addressed: how to interface with the simulation code, how to run simulations (locally, or on a cluster or cloud), which model type to approximate the data with and how to set the model complexity (e.g., topology of a neural network), how to estimate the model quality and ensure the domain expert trusts the model, how to decide which simulations to run (data collection), etc. The data collection aspect is worth emphasizing. Since data is computationally expensive to obtain and the optimal data distribution is not known up front, data points should be selected iteratively, there where the information gain will be the greatest. A sampling function is needed that minimizes the number of sample points selected in each iteration, yet maximizes the information gain of each iteration step. This process is called adaptive sampling but is also known as active learning, or sequential design. There is a complex dependency web between these different options and dealing with these dependencies is non-trivial, particularly for a domain expert for whom the surrogate model is just an intermediate step towards solving a larger, more important problem. Few domain experts will be experts in the intricacies of efﬁcient sampling and modeling strategies. Their primary concern is obtaining an accurate replacement metamodel for their problem as fast as possible and with minimal overhead (Gorissen et al., 2009d). As a result these choices are often made in a pragmatic, sometimes even ad-hoc, manner. This paper discusses an advanced, and integrated software framework that provides a ﬂexible and rigorous means to tackle such problems. This work lies at the intersection of Machine Learning/AI, Modeling and Simulation, and Distributed Computing. The methods developed are applicable to any domain where a cheap, accurate, approximation is needed to replace some expensive reference model. Our experience has been that the availability of such a framework can facilitate the transfer of knowledge from surrogate modeling researchers and lower the barrier of entry for domain experts. 2. SUMO Toolbox The platform in question is the Matlab SUrrogate MOdeling (SUMO) Toolbox, illustrated in Figure 1. Given a simulation engine (Fluent, Cadence, Abaqus, HFSS, etc.) or other data source (data 2052 A S URROGATE M ODELING AND A DAPTIVE S AMPLING TOOLBOX FOR C OMPUTER BASED D ESIGN Figure 1: The SUMO Toolbox is a ﬂexible framework for accurate global surrogate modeling and adaptive sampling (active learning). It features a rich set of plugins, is applicable to a wide range of domains, and can be applied in an autonomous, black-box fashion, or under full manual control. Written in Matlab and Java it is fully cross platform and comes with a large (60+) number of example problems. set, Matlab script, Java class, etc.), the toolbox drives the data source to produce a surrogate model within the time and accuracy constraints set by the user. The SUMO Toolbox adopts a microkernel design philosophy with many different plugins available for each of the different sub-problems:1 model types (rational functions, Kriging, splines, SVM, ANN, etc.), hyperparameter optimization algorithms (Particle Swarm Optimization, Efﬁcient Global Optimization, simulated annealing, Genetic Algorithm, etc.), model selection algorithms (cross validation, AIC, Leave-out set, etc.), sample selection (random, error based, density based, hybrid, etc.), Design of Experiments (Latin hypercube, Box-Bhenken, etc.), and sample evaluation methods (local, on a cluster or grid). The behavior of each software component is conﬁgurable through a central XML ﬁle and components can easily be added, removed or replaced by custom implementations. In addition the toolbox provides ‘meta’ plugins. For example to automatically select the best model type for a given problem (Gorissen et al., 2009d) or to use multiple model selection or sample selection criteria in concert (Gorissen et al., 2010). Furthermore, there is built-in support for high performance computing. On the modeling side, the model generation process can take full advantage of multi-core CPUs and even of a complete cluster or grid. This can result in signiﬁcant speedups for model types where the ﬁtting process can be expensive (e.g., neural networks). Likewise, sample evaluation (simulation) can occur locally (with the option to take advantage of multi-core architectures) or on a separate compute cluster or grid (possibly accessed through a remote head-node). All interfacing with the grid middleware 1. The full list of plugins and features can be found at http://www.sumowiki.intec.ugent.be. 2053 G ORISSEN , C OUCKUYT, D EMEESTER , D HAENE AND C ROMBECQ (submission, job monitoring, rescheduling of failed/lost simulation points, etc.) is handled transparently and automatically (see Gorissen et al., 2009c for more details). Also, the sample evaluation component runs in parallel with the other components (non-blocking) and not sequentially. This allows for an optimal use of computational resources. In addition the SUMO Toolbox contains extensive logging and proﬁling capabilities so that the modeling process can easily be tracked and the modeling decisions understood. Once a ﬁnal model has been generated, a GUI tool is available to visually explore the model (including derivatives and prediction uncertainty), assess its quality, and export it for use in other software tools. 3. Applications The SUMO Toolbox has already been applied successfully to a very wide range of applications, including RF circuit block modeling (Gorissen et al., 2009b), hydrological modeling (Couckuyt et al., 2009), Electronic Packaging (Zhu and Franzon, 2009), aerodynamic modeling (Gorissen et al., 2009a), process engineering (Stephens et al., 2009), and automotive data modeling (Gorissen et al., 2010). Besides global modeling capabilities, the SUMO Toolbox also includes a powerful optimization framework based on the Efﬁcient Global Optimization framework developed by Jones et al. (1998). As of version 6.1, the toolbox also contains an example of how the framework can also be applied to solve classiﬁcation problems. In sum, the goal of the toolbox is to ﬁll the void in machine learning software when it comes to the challenging, costly, real-valued, problems faced in computational engineering. The toolbox is in use successfully at various institutions and we are continuously reﬁning and extending the set of available plugins as the number of applications increase.

<p>Author: Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: We study losses for binary classiﬁcation and class probability estimation and extend the understanding of them from margin losses to general composite losses which are the composition of a proper loss with a link function. We characterise when margin losses can be proper composite losses, explicitly show how to determine a symmetric loss in full from half of one of its partial losses, introduce an intrinsic parametrisation of composite binary losses and give a complete characterisation of the relationship between proper losses and “classiﬁcation calibrated” losses. We also consider the question of the “best” surrogate binary loss. We introduce a precise notion of “best” and show there exist situations where two convex surrogate losses are incommensurable. We provide a complete explicit characterisation of the convexity of composite binary losses in terms of the link function and the weight function associated with the proper loss which make up the composite loss. This characterisation suggests new ways of “surrogate tuning” as well as providing an explicit characterisation of when Bregman divergences on the unit interval are convex in their second argument. Finally, in an appendix we present some new algorithm-independent results on the relationship between properness, convexity and robustness to misclassiﬁcation noise for binary losses and show that all convex proper losses are non-robust to misclassiﬁcation noise.

<p>Author: Sören Sonnenburg, Gunnar Rätsch, Sebastian Henschel, Christian Widmer, Jonas Behr, Alexander Zien, Fabio de Bona, Alexander Binder, Christian Gehl, Vojtěch Franc</p><p>Abstract: We have developed a machine learning toolbox, called SHOGUN, which is designed for uniﬁed large-scale learning for a broad range of feature types and learning settings. It offers a considerable number of machine learning models such as support vector machines, hidden Markov models, multiple kernel learning, linear discriminant analysis, and more. Most of the speciﬁc algorithms are able to deal with several different data classes. We have used this toolbox in several applications from computational biology, some of them coming with no less than 50 million training examples and others with 7 billion test examples. With more than a thousand installations worldwide, SHOGUN is already widely adopted in the machine learning community and beyond.

<p>Author: Ming Yuan, Marten Wegkamp</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of binary classiﬁcation with a reject option in which one can withhold the decision of classifying an observation at a cost lower than that of misclassiﬁcation. Since the natural loss function is non-convex so that empirical risk minimization easily becomes infeasible, the paper proposes minimizing convex risks based on surrogate convex loss functions. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for inﬁnite sample consistency (both risks share the same minimizer) is provided. Moreover, we show that the excess risk can be bounded through the excess surrogate risk under appropriate conditions. These bounds can be tightened by a generalized margin condition. The impact of the results is illustrated on several commonly used surrogate loss functions.

<p>Author: Carl Edward Rasmussen, Hannes Nickisch</p><p>Abstract: The GPML toolbox provides a wide range of functionality for Gaussian process (GP) inference and prediction. GPs are speciﬁed by mean and covariance functions; we offer a library of simple mean and covariance functions and mechanisms to compose more complex ones. Several likelihood functions are supported including Gaussian and heavy-tailed for regression as well as others suitable for classiﬁcation. Finally, a range of inference methods is provided, including exact and variational inference, Expectation Propagation, and Laplace’s method dealing with non-Gaussian likelihoods and FITC for dealing with large regression tasks. Keywords: Gaussian processes, nonparametric Bayes, probabilistic regression and classiﬁcation Gaussian processes (GPs) (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) have convenient properties for many modelling tasks in machine learning and statistics. They can be used to specify distributions over functions without having to commit to a speciﬁc functional form. Applications range from regression over classiﬁcation to reinforcement learning, spatial models, survival and other time series1 models. Predictions of GP models come with a natural conﬁdence measure: predictive error-bars. Although the implementation of the basic principles in the simplest case is straight forward, various complicating features are often desired in practice. For example, a GP is determined by a mean function and a covariance function, but these functions are mostly difﬁcult to specify fully a priori, and typically they are given in terms of hyperparameters, that is, parameters which have to be inferred. Another source of difﬁculty is the likelihood function. For Gaussian likelihoods, inference is analytically tractable; however, in many tasks, Gaussian likelihoods are not appropriate, and approximate inference methods such as Expectation Propagation (EP) (Minka, 2001), Laplace’s approximation (LA) (Williams and Barber, 1998) and variational bounds (VB) (Gibbs and MacKay, 2000) become necessary (Nickisch and Rasmussen, 2008). In case of large training data, approximations (Candela and Rasmussen, 2005) like FITC (Snelson and Ghahramani, 2006) are needed. The GPML toolbox is designed to overcome these hurdles with its variety of mean, covariance and likelihood functions as well as inference methods, while being simple to use and easy to extend. ∗.

Implementation The GPML toolbox can be obtained from http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/ and also http://mloss.org/software/view/263/ under the FreeBSD license. Based on simple interfaces for covariance, mean, likelihood functions as well as inference methods, we offer full compatibility to both Matlab 7.x2 and GNU Octave 3.2.x.3 Special attention has been given to properly disentangle covariance, likelihood and mean hyperparameters. Also, care has been taken to avoid numerical inaccuracies, for example, safe likelihood evaluations for extreme inputs and stable matrix operations. For example, the covariance matrix K can become numerically close to singular making its naive inversion numerically unsafe. We handle these situations in a principled way4 such that Cholesky decompositions are computed of well-conditioned matrices only. As a result, our code shows a high level of robustness along the full spectrum of possible hyperparameters. The focus of the toolbox is on approximate inference using dense matrix algebra. We currently do not support covariance matrix approximation techniques to deal with large numbers of training examples n. Looking at the (growing) body of literature on sparse approximations, this knowledge is still somewhat in ﬂux, and consensus on the best approaches has not yet been reached. We provide stable and modular code checked by an exhaustive suite of test cases. A single function gp.m serves as main interface to the user—it can make inference and predictions and allows the mean, covariance and likelihood function as well as the inference methods to be speciﬁed freely. Furthermore, gp.m enables convenient learning of the hyperparameters by maximising the log marginal likelihood ln Z. One of the particularly appealing properties of GP models is that principled and practical approaches exist for learning the parameters of mean, covariance and likelihood functions. Good adaptation of such parameters can be essential to obtain both high quality predictions and insights into the properties of the data. The GPML toolbox is particularly ﬂexible, including a large library of different covariance and mean functions, and ﬂexible ways to combine these into more expressive, specialised functions. The user can choose between two gradient-based optimisers: one uses conjugate gradients (CG)5 and the other one relies on a quasi-Newton scheme.6 ∂ Computing the derivatives w.r.t. hyperparameters ∂θi ln Z with gp.m does not need any extra programming effort; every inference method automatically collects the respective derivatives from the mean, covariance and likelihood functions and passes them to gp.m. Our documentation comes in two pieces: a hypertext user documentation7 doc/index.html with examples and code browsing and a technical documentation8 doc/manual.pdf focusing on the interfaces and more technical issues. A casual user will use the hypertext document to quickly get his data analysed, however a power user will consult the pdf document once he wants to include his own mean, covariance, likelihood and inference routines or learn about implementation details. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

The GPML Toolbox We illustrate the modular structure of the GPML toolbox by means of a simple code example. GPs are used to formalise and update knowledge about distributions over functions. A GP prior distribution on an unknown latent function f ∼ GP (mφ (x), kψ (x, x′ )), consists of a mean function m(x) = E[ f (x)], and a covariance function k(x, x) = E[( f (x) − m(x))( f (x′ ) − m(x′ ))], both of which typically contain hyperparameters φ and ψ, which we want to ﬁt in the light of data. We generally assume independent observations, that is, input/output pairs (xi , yi ) of f with joint likelihood Pρ (y|f) = ∏n Pρ (yi | f (xi )) factorising over cases. Finally, after speciﬁcation of the prior and i=1 ﬁtting of the hyperparameters θ = {φ, ψ, ρ}, we wish to compute predictive distributions for test cases. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 % 1) SET UP THE GP : COVARIANCE ; MEAN , LIKELIHOOD , INFERENCE METHOD mf = { ’ meanSum ’ ,{ ’ meanLinear ’, @meanConst }}; a = 2; b = 1; % m(x) = a*x+b cf = { ’ covSEiso ’}; sf = 1; ell = 0.7; % squared exponential covariance funct lf = ’ likLaplace ’; sn = 0.2; % assume Laplace noise with variance sn ˆ2 hyp0 . mean = [a;b ]; hyp0 . cov = log([ ell ; sf ]); hyp0 . lik = log( sn ); % hypers inf = ’ infEP ’; % specify expectation propagation as inference method % 2) MINIMISE NEGATIVE LOG MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD nlZ wrt . hyp ; do 50 CG steps Ncg = 50; [hyp , nlZ ] = minimize ( hyp0 , ’gp ’, -Ncg , inf , mf , cf , lf , X , y ); % 3) PREDICT AT UNKNOWN TEST INPUTS [ymu , ys2 ] = gp (hyp , inf , mf , cf , lf , X , y , Xs ); % test input Xs In line 1, we specify the mean mφ (x) = a⊤ x + b of the GP with hyperparameters φ = {a, b}. First, the functional form of the mean function is given and its parameters are initialised. The desired mean function, happens not to exist in the library of mean functions; instead we have to make a composite mean function from simple constituents. This is done using a nested cell array containing the algebraic expression for m(x): As the sum of a linear (mean/meanLinear.m) and a constant mean function (mean/meanConst.m) it is an afﬁne function. In addition to linear and constant mean functions, the toolbox offers m(x) = 0 and m(x) = 1. These simple mean functions can be combined by composite mean functions to obtain sums (mean/meanSum.m) m(x) = ∑ j m j (x), products m(x) = ∏ j m j (x), scaled versions m(x) = αm0 (x) and powers m(x) = m0 (x)d . This ﬂexible mechanism is used for convenient speciﬁcation of an extensible algebra of mean functions. Note that functions are referred to either as name strings ’meanConst’ or alternatively function handles @meanConst. The order of components of the hyperparameters φ is the same as in the speciﬁcation of the cell array. Every mean function implements its evaluation m = mφ (X) and ﬁrst derivative ∂ computation mi = ∂φi mφ (X) on a data set X. In the same spirit, the squared exponential covariance kψ (x, x′ ) = σ f ² exp(− x − x′ 2 /2ℓ2 ) (cov/covSEiso.m) with hyperparameters ψ = {ln ℓ, ln σ f } is set up in line 2. Note, that the hyperparameters are represented by the logarithms, as these parameters are naturally positive. Many other simple covariance functions are contained in the toolbox. Among others, we offer linear, constant, Mat´ rn, rational quadratic, polynomial, periodic, neural network and ﬁnite support coe variance functions. Composite covariance functions allow for sums k(x, x′ ) = ∑ j k j (x, x′ ), products k(x, x′ ) = ∏ j k j (x, x′ ), positive scaling k(x, x′ ) = σ2 k0 (x, x′ ) and masking of components f k(x, x′ ) = k0 (xI , x′ ) with I ⊆ [1, 2, .., D], x ∈ RD . Again, the interface is simple since only the I ∂ evaluation of the covariance matrix K = kψ (X) and its derivatives ∂i K = ∂ψi kψ (X) on a data set X are required. Furthermore, we need cross terms k∗ = kψ (X, x∗ ) and k∗∗ = kψ (x∗ , x∗ ) for prediction. There are no restrictions on the composition of both mean and covariance functions—any combination is allowed including nested composition. 3013 R ASMUSSEN AND N ICKISCH √ √ The Laplace (lik/likLaplace.m) likelihood Pρ (y| f ) = exp(− 2/σn |y − f |)/ 2σn with hyperparameters ρ = {ln σn } is speciﬁed in line 3. There are only simple likelihood functions: Gaussian, Sech-squared, Laplacian and Student’s t for ordinary and sparse regression as well as the error and the logistic function for classiﬁcation. Again, the same inference code is used for any likelihood function. Although the speciﬁcation of likelihood functions is simple for the user, writing new likelihood functions is slightly more involved as different inference methods require access to different properties; for example, LA requires second derivatives and EP requires derivatives of moments. All hyperparameters θ = {φ, ψ, ρ} are stored in a struct hyp.{mean,cov,lik}, which is initialised in line 4; we select the approximate inference algorithm EP (inf/infEP.m) in line 5. We optimise the hyperparameters θ ≡ hyp by calling the CG optimiser (util/minimize.m) with initial value θ0 ≡ hyp0 in line 6 allowing at most N = 50 evaluations of the EP approximation to the marginal likelihood ZEP (θ) as done by gp.m. Here, D = (X, y) ≡ (X,y) is the training data where X = {x1 , .., xn } and y ∈ Rn . Under the hood, gp.m computes in every step a Gaussian ∂ posterior approximation and the derivatives ∂θ ln ZEP (θ) of the marginal likelihood by calling EP. Predictions with optimised hyperparameters are done in line 7, where we call gp.m with the unseen test inputs X∗ ≡ Xs as additional argument. As a result, we obtain the approximate marginal predictive mean E[P(y∗ |D , X∗ )] ≡ ymu and the predictive variance V[P(y∗ |D , X∗ )] ≡ ys2.

Exact inference and the FITC approximation support the Gaussian likelihood only. Variational Bayesian (VB) inference is applicable to all likelihoods. Expectation propagation (EP) for the Student’s t likelihood is inherently unstable due to its non-log-concavity. The Laplace approximation (LA) for Laplace likelihoods is not sensible due to the non-differentiable peak of the Laplace likelihood. Special care has been taken for the non-convex optimisation problem imposed by the combination Student’s t likelihood and LA. If the number of training examples is larger than a few thousand, dense matrix computations become too slow. We provide the FITC approximation for regression with Gaussian likelihood where ˜ instead of the exact covariance matrix K, a low-rank plus diagonal matrix K = Q + diag(K − Q) ⊤ K−1 K is used. The matrices K and K contain covariances and cross-covariances where Q = Ku uu u uu u of and between inducing inputs ui and data points x j . Using inf/infFITC.m together with any covariance function wrapped into cov/covFITC.m makes the computations feasible for large n.

<p>Author: Andreas Krause</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, a fundamental problem structure has emerged as very useful in a variety of machine learning applications: Submodularity is an intuitive diminishing returns property, stating that adding an element to a smaller set helps more than adding it to a larger set. Similarly to convexity, submodularity allows one to efﬁciently ﬁnd provably (near-) optimal solutions for large problems. We present SFO, a toolbox for use in MATLAB or Octave that implements algorithms for minimization and maximization of submodular functions.

<p>Author: Dirk Gorissen, Ivo Couckuyt, Piet Demeester, Tom Dhaene, Karel Crombecq</p><p>Abstract: An exceedingly large number of scientiﬁc and engineering ﬁelds are confronted with the need for computer simulations to study complex, real world phenomena or solve challenging design problems. However, due to the computational cost of these high ﬁdelity simulations, the use of neural networks, kernel methods, and other surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable. Surrogate models are compact and cheap to evaluate, and have proven very useful for tasks such as optimization, design space exploration, prototyping, and sensitivity analysis. Consequently, in many ﬁelds there is great interest in tools and techniques that facilitate the construction of such regression models, while minimizing the computational cost and maximizing model accuracy. This paper presents a mature, ﬂexible, and adaptive machine learning toolkit for regression modeling and active learning to tackle these issues. The toolkit brings together algorithms for data ﬁtting, model selection, sample selection (active learning), hyperparameter optimization, and distributed computing in order to empower a domain expert to efﬁciently generate an accurate model for the problem or data at hand. Keywords: surrogate modeling, metamodeling, function approximation, model selection, adaptive sampling, active learning, distributed computing 1. Background and Motivation In many science and engineering problems researchers make heavy use of computer simulation codes in order to replace expensive physical experiments and improve the quality and performance of engineered products and devices. Such simulation activities are collectively referred to as computational science/engineering. Unfortunately, while allowing scientists more ﬂexibility to study phenomena under controlled conditions, computer simulations require a substantial investment of c 2010 Dirk Gorissen, Ivo Couckuyt, Piet Demeester, Tom Dhaene and Karel Crombecq. G ORISSEN , C OUCKUYT, D EMEESTER , D HAENE AND C ROMBECQ computation time. One simulation may take many minutes, hours, days or even weeks, quickly rendering parameter studies impractical (Forrester et al., 2008; Simpson et al., 2008). Of the different ways to deal with this problem, this paper is concerned with the construction of simpler approximation models to predict the system performance and develop a relationship between the system inputs and outputs. When properly constructed, these approximation models mimic the behavior of the simulation accurately while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Different approximation methods exist, each with their relative merits. This work concentrates on the use of data-driven, global approximations using compact surrogate models (also known as metamodels, replacement models, or response surface models). Examples include: rational functions, Kriging models, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN), splines, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Once such a global approximation is available it is of great use for gaining insight into the behavior of the underlying system. The surrogate may be easily queried, optimized, visualized, and seamlessly integrated into CAD/CAE software packages. The challenge is thus how to generate an approximation model that is as accurate as possible over the complete domain of interest while minimizing the simulation cost. Solving this challenge involves multiple sub-problems that must be addressed: how to interface with the simulation code, how to run simulations (locally, or on a cluster or cloud), which model type to approximate the data with and how to set the model complexity (e.g., topology of a neural network), how to estimate the model quality and ensure the domain expert trusts the model, how to decide which simulations to run (data collection), etc. The data collection aspect is worth emphasizing. Since data is computationally expensive to obtain and the optimal data distribution is not known up front, data points should be selected iteratively, there where the information gain will be the greatest. A sampling function is needed that minimizes the number of sample points selected in each iteration, yet maximizes the information gain of each iteration step. This process is called adaptive sampling but is also known as active learning, or sequential design. There is a complex dependency web between these different options and dealing with these dependencies is non-trivial, particularly for a domain expert for whom the surrogate model is just an intermediate step towards solving a larger, more important problem. Few domain experts will be experts in the intricacies of efﬁcient sampling and modeling strategies. Their primary concern is obtaining an accurate replacement metamodel for their problem as fast as possible and with minimal overhead (Gorissen et al., 2009d). As a result these choices are often made in a pragmatic, sometimes even ad-hoc, manner. This paper discusses an advanced, and integrated software framework that provides a ﬂexible and rigorous means to tackle such problems. This work lies at the intersection of Machine Learning/AI, Modeling and Simulation, and Distributed Computing. The methods developed are applicable to any domain where a cheap, accurate, approximation is needed to replace some expensive reference model. Our experience has been that the availability of such a framework can facilitate the transfer of knowledge from surrogate modeling researchers and lower the barrier of entry for domain experts. 2. SUMO Toolbox The platform in question is the Matlab SUrrogate MOdeling (SUMO) Toolbox, illustrated in Figure 1. Given a simulation engine (Fluent, Cadence, Abaqus, HFSS, etc.) or other data source (data 2052 A S URROGATE M ODELING AND A DAPTIVE S AMPLING TOOLBOX FOR C OMPUTER BASED D ESIGN Figure 1: The SUMO Toolbox is a ﬂexible framework for accurate global surrogate modeling and adaptive sampling (active learning). It features a rich set of plugins, is applicable to a wide range of domains, and can be applied in an autonomous, black-box fashion, or under full manual control. Written in Matlab and Java it is fully cross platform and comes with a large (60+) number of example problems. set, Matlab script, Java class, etc.), the toolbox drives the data source to produce a surrogate model within the time and accuracy constraints set by the user. The SUMO Toolbox adopts a microkernel design philosophy with many different plugins available for each of the different sub-problems:1 model types (rational functions, Kriging, splines, SVM, ANN, etc.), hyperparameter optimization algorithms (Particle Swarm Optimization, Efﬁcient Global Optimization, simulated annealing, Genetic Algorithm, etc.), model selection algorithms (cross validation, AIC, Leave-out set, etc.), sample selection (random, error based, density based, hybrid, etc.), Design of Experiments (Latin hypercube, Box-Bhenken, etc.), and sample evaluation methods (local, on a cluster or grid). The behavior of each software component is conﬁgurable through a central XML ﬁle and components can easily be added, removed or replaced by custom implementations. In addition the toolbox provides ‘meta’ plugins. For example to automatically select the best model type for a given problem (Gorissen et al., 2009d) or to use multiple model selection or sample selection criteria in concert (Gorissen et al., 2010). Furthermore, there is built-in support for high performance computing. On the modeling side, the model generation process can take full advantage of multi-core CPUs and even of a complete cluster or grid. This can result in signiﬁcant speedups for model types where the ﬁtting process can be expensive (e.g., neural networks). Likewise, sample evaluation (simulation) can occur locally (with the option to take advantage of multi-core architectures) or on a separate compute cluster or grid (possibly accessed through a remote head-node). All interfacing with the grid middleware 1. The full list of plugins and features can be found at http://www.sumowiki.intec.ugent.be. 2053 G ORISSEN , C OUCKUYT, D EMEESTER , D HAENE AND C ROMBECQ (submission, job monitoring, rescheduling of failed/lost simulation points, etc.) is handled transparently and automatically (see Gorissen et al., 2009c for more details). Also, the sample evaluation component runs in parallel with the other components (non-blocking) and not sequentially. This allows for an optimal use of computational resources. In addition the SUMO Toolbox contains extensive logging and proﬁling capabilities so that the modeling process can easily be tracked and the modeling decisions understood. Once a ﬁnal model has been generated, a GUI tool is available to visually explore the model (including derivatives and prediction uncertainty), assess its quality, and export it for use in other software tools. 3. Applications The SUMO Toolbox has already been applied successfully to a very wide range of applications, including RF circuit block modeling (Gorissen et al., 2009b), hydrological modeling (Couckuyt et al., 2009), Electronic Packaging (Zhu and Franzon, 2009), aerodynamic modeling (Gorissen et al., 2009a), process engineering (Stephens et al., 2009), and automotive data modeling (Gorissen et al., 2010). Besides global modeling capabilities, the SUMO Toolbox also includes a powerful optimization framework based on the Efﬁcient Global Optimization framework developed by Jones et al. (1998). As of version 6.1, the toolbox also contains an example of how the framework can also be applied to solve classiﬁcation problems. In sum, the goal of the toolbox is to ﬁll the void in machine learning software when it comes to the challenging, costly, real-valued, problems faced in computational engineering. The toolbox is in use successfully at various institutions and we are continuously reﬁning and extending the set of available plugins as the number of applications increase.

<p>Author: Pannagadatta K. Shivaswamy, Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: Leading classiﬁcation methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) and their counterparts achieve strong generalization performance by maximizing the margin of separation between data classes. While the maximum margin approach has achieved promising performance, this article identiﬁes its sensitivity to afﬁne transformations of the data and to directions with large data spread. Maximum margin solutions may be misled by the spread of data and preferentially separate classes along large spread directions. This article corrects these weaknesses by measuring margin not in the absolute sense but rather only relative to the spread of data in any projection direction. Maximum relative margin corresponds to a data-dependent regularization on the classiﬁcation function while maximum absolute margin corresponds to an ℓ2 norm constraint on the classiﬁcation function. Interestingly, the proposed improvements only require simple extensions to existing maximum margin formulations and preserve the computational efﬁciency of SVMs. Through the maximization of relative margin, surprising performance gains are achieved on real-world problems such as digit, text classiﬁcation and on several other benchmark data sets. In addition, risk bounds are derived for the new formulation based on Rademacher averages.

<p>Author: Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis class used, independently of any algorithm. In contrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight generalization bounds that are tailored to speciﬁc learning algorithms by exploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory, existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the samples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence. This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a stationary ϕ-mixing or β-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in the study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between observations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based generalization bounds for stationary ϕ-mixing and β-mixing sequences. These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply to all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of stability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios. We also illustrate the application of our ϕ-mixing generalization bounds to general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression, Kernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel regularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms. These novel bounds can thus be viewed as the ﬁrst theoretical basis for the use of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios.

<p>Author: Isabelle Guyon, Amir Saffari, Gideon Dror, Gavin Cawley</p><p>Abstract: The principle of parsimony also known as “Ockham’s razor” has inspired many theories of model selection. Yet such theories, all making arguments in favor of parsimony, are based on very different premises and have developed distinct methodologies to derive algorithms. We have organized challenges and edited a special issue of JMLR and several conference proceedings around the theme of model selection. In this editorial, we revisit the problem of avoiding overﬁtting in light of the latest results. We note the remarkable convergence of theories as different as Bayesian theory, Minimum Description Length, bias/variance tradeoff, Structural Risk Minimization, and regularization, in some approaches. We also present new and interesting examples of the complementarity of theories leading to hybrid algorithms, neither frequentist, nor Bayesian, or perhaps both frequentist and Bayesian!

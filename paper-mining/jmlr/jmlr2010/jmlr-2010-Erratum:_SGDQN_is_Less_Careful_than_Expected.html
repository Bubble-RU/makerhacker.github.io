<p>Author: Lin Xiao</p><p>Abstract: We consider regularized stochastic learning and online optimization problems, where the objective function is the sum of two convex terms: one is the loss function of the learning task, and the other is a simple regularization term such as ℓ1 -norm for promoting sparsity. We develop extensions of Nesterov’s dual averaging method, that can exploit the regularization structure in an online setting. At each iteration of these methods, the learning variables are adjusted by solving a simple minimization problem that involves the running average of all past subgradients of the loss function and the whole regularization term, not just its subgradient. In the case of ℓ1 -regularization, our method is particularly effective in obtaining sparse solutions. We show that these methods achieve the optimal convergence rates or regret bounds that are standard in the literature on stochastic and online convex optimization. For stochastic learning problems in which the loss functions have Lipschitz continuous gradients, we also present an accelerated version of the dual averaging method.

<p>Author: Choon Hui Teo, S.V.N. Vishwanthan, Alex J. Smola, Quoc V. Le</p><p>Abstract: A wide variety of machine learning problems can be described as minimizing a regularized risk functional, with different algorithms using different notions of risk and different regularizers. Examples include linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gaussian Processes, Logistic Regression, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), and Lasso amongst others. This paper describes the theory and implementation of a scalable and modular convex solver which solves all these estimation problems. It can be parallelized on a cluster of workstations, allows for data-locality, and can deal with regularizers such as L1 and L2 penalties. In addition to the uniﬁed framework we present tight convergence bounds, which show that our algorithm converges in O(1/ε) steps to ε precision for general convex problems and in O(log(1/ε)) steps for continuously differentiable problems. We demonstrate the performance of our general purpose solver on a variety of publicly available data sets.

<p>Author: Jin Yu, S.V.N. Vishwanathan, Simon Güunter, Nicol N. Schraudolph</p><p>Abstract: We extend the well-known BFGS quasi-Newton method and its memory-limited variant LBFGS to the optimization of nonsmooth convex objectives. This is done in a rigorous fashion by generalizing three components of BFGS to subdifferentials: the local quadratic model, the identiﬁcation of a descent direction, and the Wolfe line search conditions. We prove that under some technical conditions, the resulting subBFGS algorithm is globally convergent in objective function value. We apply its memory-limited variant (subLBFGS) to L2 -regularized risk minimization with the binary hinge loss. To extend our algorithm to the multiclass and multilabel settings, we develop a new, efﬁcient, exact line search algorithm. We prove its worst-case time complexity bounds, and show that our line search can also be used to extend a recently developed bundle method to the multiclass and multilabel settings. We also apply the direction-ﬁnding component of our algorithm to L1 -regularized risk minimization with logistic loss. In all these contexts our methods perform comparable to or better than specialized state-of-the-art solvers on a number of publicly available data sets. An open source implementation of our algorithms is freely available.

<p>Author: Joshua W. Robinson, Alexander J. Hartemink</p><p>Abstract: Learning dynamic Bayesian network structures provides a principled mechanism for identifying conditional dependencies in time-series data. An important assumption of traditional DBN structure learning is that the data are generated by a stationary process, an assumption that is not true in many important settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of graphical model called a nonstationary dynamic Bayesian network, in which the conditional dependence structure of the underlying data-generation process is permitted to change over time. Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks represent a new framework for studying problems in which the structure of a network is evolving over time. Some examples of evolving networks are transcriptional regulatory networks during an organism’s development, neural pathways during learning, and trafﬁc patterns during the day. We deﬁne the non-stationary DBN model, present an MCMC sampling algorithm for learning the structure of the model from time-series data under different assumptions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on both simulated and biological data.

<p>Author: Jin Yu, S.V.N. Vishwanathan, Simon Güunter, Nicol N. Schraudolph</p><p>Abstract: We extend the well-known BFGS quasi-Newton method and its memory-limited variant LBFGS to the optimization of nonsmooth convex objectives. This is done in a rigorous fashion by generalizing three components of BFGS to subdifferentials: the local quadratic model, the identiﬁcation of a descent direction, and the Wolfe line search conditions. We prove that under some technical conditions, the resulting subBFGS algorithm is globally convergent in objective function value. We apply its memory-limited variant (subLBFGS) to L2 -regularized risk minimization with the binary hinge loss. To extend our algorithm to the multiclass and multilabel settings, we develop a new, efﬁcient, exact line search algorithm. We prove its worst-case time complexity bounds, and show that our line search can also be used to extend a recently developed bundle method to the multiclass and multilabel settings. We also apply the direction-ﬁnding component of our algorithm to L1 -regularized risk minimization with logistic loss. In all these contexts our methods perform comparable to or better than specialized state-of-the-art solvers on a number of publicly available data sets. An open source implementation of our algorithms is freely available.

<p>Author: Alexander Ilin, Tapani Raiko</p><p>Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a classical data analysis technique that Ä?Ĺš nds linear transformations of data that retain the maximal amount of variance. We study a case where some of the data values are missing, and show that this problem has many features which are usually associated with nonlinear models, such as overÄ?Ĺš tting and bad locally optimal solutions. A probabilistic formulation of PCA provides a good foundation for handling missing values, and we provide formulas for doing that. In case of high dimensional and very sparse data, overÄ?Ĺš tting becomes a severe problem and traditional algorithms for PCA are very slow. We introduce a novel fast algorithm and extend it to variational Bayesian learning. Different versions of PCA are compared in artiÄ?Ĺš cial experiments, demonstrating the effects of regularization and modeling of posterior variance. The scalability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to the NetÄ?Ĺš&sbquo;ix problem.

<p>Author: Joshua W. Robinson, Alexander J. Hartemink</p><p>Abstract: Learning dynamic Bayesian network structures provides a principled mechanism for identifying conditional dependencies in time-series data. An important assumption of traditional DBN structure learning is that the data are generated by a stationary process, an assumption that is not true in many important settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of graphical model called a nonstationary dynamic Bayesian network, in which the conditional dependence structure of the underlying data-generation process is permitted to change over time. Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks represent a new framework for studying problems in which the structure of a network is evolving over time. Some examples of evolving networks are transcriptional regulatory networks during an organism’s development, neural pathways during learning, and trafﬁc patterns during the day. We deﬁne the non-stationary DBN model, present an MCMC sampling algorithm for learning the structure of the model from time-series data under different assumptions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on both simulated and biological data.

<p>Author: Carl Edward Rasmussen, Hannes Nickisch</p><p>Abstract: The GPML toolbox provides a wide range of functionality for Gaussian process (GP) inference and prediction. GPs are speciﬁed by mean and covariance functions; we offer a library of simple mean and covariance functions and mechanisms to compose more complex ones. Several likelihood functions are supported including Gaussian and heavy-tailed for regression as well as others suitable for classiﬁcation. Finally, a range of inference methods is provided, including exact and variational inference, Expectation Propagation, and Laplace’s method dealing with non-Gaussian likelihoods and FITC for dealing with large regression tasks. Keywords: Gaussian processes, nonparametric Bayes, probabilistic regression and classiﬁcation Gaussian processes (GPs) (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) have convenient properties for many modelling tasks in machine learning and statistics. They can be used to specify distributions over functions without having to commit to a speciﬁc functional form. Applications range from regression over classiﬁcation to reinforcement learning, spatial models, survival and other time series1 models. Predictions of GP models come with a natural conﬁdence measure: predictive error-bars. Although the implementation of the basic principles in the simplest case is straight forward, various complicating features are often desired in practice. For example, a GP is determined by a mean function and a covariance function, but these functions are mostly difﬁcult to specify fully a priori, and typically they are given in terms of hyperparameters, that is, parameters which have to be inferred. Another source of difﬁculty is the likelihood function. For Gaussian likelihoods, inference is analytically tractable; however, in many tasks, Gaussian likelihoods are not appropriate, and approximate inference methods such as Expectation Propagation (EP) (Minka, 2001), Laplace’s approximation (LA) (Williams and Barber, 1998) and variational bounds (VB) (Gibbs and MacKay, 2000) become necessary (Nickisch and Rasmussen, 2008). In case of large training data, approximations (Candela and Rasmussen, 2005) like FITC (Snelson and Ghahramani, 2006) are needed. The GPML toolbox is designed to overcome these hurdles with its variety of mean, covariance and likelihood functions as well as inference methods, while being simple to use and easy to extend. ∗.

Implementation The GPML toolbox can be obtained from http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/ and also http://mloss.org/software/view/263/ under the FreeBSD license. Based on simple interfaces for covariance, mean, likelihood functions as well as inference methods, we offer full compatibility to both Matlab 7.x2 and GNU Octave 3.2.x.3 Special attention has been given to properly disentangle covariance, likelihood and mean hyperparameters. Also, care has been taken to avoid numerical inaccuracies, for example, safe likelihood evaluations for extreme inputs and stable matrix operations. For example, the covariance matrix K can become numerically close to singular making its naive inversion numerically unsafe. We handle these situations in a principled way4 such that Cholesky decompositions are computed of well-conditioned matrices only. As a result, our code shows a high level of robustness along the full spectrum of possible hyperparameters. The focus of the toolbox is on approximate inference using dense matrix algebra. We currently do not support covariance matrix approximation techniques to deal with large numbers of training examples n. Looking at the (growing) body of literature on sparse approximations, this knowledge is still somewhat in ﬂux, and consensus on the best approaches has not yet been reached. We provide stable and modular code checked by an exhaustive suite of test cases. A single function gp.m serves as main interface to the user—it can make inference and predictions and allows the mean, covariance and likelihood function as well as the inference methods to be speciﬁed freely. Furthermore, gp.m enables convenient learning of the hyperparameters by maximising the log marginal likelihood ln Z. One of the particularly appealing properties of GP models is that principled and practical approaches exist for learning the parameters of mean, covariance and likelihood functions. Good adaptation of such parameters can be essential to obtain both high quality predictions and insights into the properties of the data. The GPML toolbox is particularly ﬂexible, including a large library of different covariance and mean functions, and ﬂexible ways to combine these into more expressive, specialised functions. The user can choose between two gradient-based optimisers: one uses conjugate gradients (CG)5 and the other one relies on a quasi-Newton scheme.6 ∂ Computing the derivatives w.r.t. hyperparameters ∂θi ln Z with gp.m does not need any extra programming effort; every inference method automatically collects the respective derivatives from the mean, covariance and likelihood functions and passes them to gp.m. Our documentation comes in two pieces: a hypertext user documentation7 doc/index.html with examples and code browsing and a technical documentation8 doc/manual.pdf focusing on the interfaces and more technical issues. A casual user will use the hypertext document to quickly get his data analysed, however a power user will consult the pdf document once he wants to include his own mean, covariance, likelihood and inference routines or learn about implementation details. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

The GPML Toolbox We illustrate the modular structure of the GPML toolbox by means of a simple code example. GPs are used to formalise and update knowledge about distributions over functions. A GP prior distribution on an unknown latent function f ∼ GP (mφ (x), kψ (x, x′ )), consists of a mean function m(x) = E[ f (x)], and a covariance function k(x, x) = E[( f (x) − m(x))( f (x′ ) − m(x′ ))], both of which typically contain hyperparameters φ and ψ, which we want to ﬁt in the light of data. We generally assume independent observations, that is, input/output pairs (xi , yi ) of f with joint likelihood Pρ (y|f) = ∏n Pρ (yi | f (xi )) factorising over cases. Finally, after speciﬁcation of the prior and i=1 ﬁtting of the hyperparameters θ = {φ, ψ, ρ}, we wish to compute predictive distributions for test cases. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 % 1) SET UP THE GP : COVARIANCE ; MEAN , LIKELIHOOD , INFERENCE METHOD mf = { ’ meanSum ’ ,{ ’ meanLinear ’, @meanConst }}; a = 2; b = 1; % m(x) = a*x+b cf = { ’ covSEiso ’}; sf = 1; ell = 0.7; % squared exponential covariance funct lf = ’ likLaplace ’; sn = 0.2; % assume Laplace noise with variance sn ˆ2 hyp0 . mean = [a;b ]; hyp0 . cov = log([ ell ; sf ]); hyp0 . lik = log( sn ); % hypers inf = ’ infEP ’; % specify expectation propagation as inference method % 2) MINIMISE NEGATIVE LOG MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD nlZ wrt . hyp ; do 50 CG steps Ncg = 50; [hyp , nlZ ] = minimize ( hyp0 , ’gp ’, -Ncg , inf , mf , cf , lf , X , y ); % 3) PREDICT AT UNKNOWN TEST INPUTS [ymu , ys2 ] = gp (hyp , inf , mf , cf , lf , X , y , Xs ); % test input Xs In line 1, we specify the mean mφ (x) = a⊤ x + b of the GP with hyperparameters φ = {a, b}. First, the functional form of the mean function is given and its parameters are initialised. The desired mean function, happens not to exist in the library of mean functions; instead we have to make a composite mean function from simple constituents. This is done using a nested cell array containing the algebraic expression for m(x): As the sum of a linear (mean/meanLinear.m) and a constant mean function (mean/meanConst.m) it is an afﬁne function. In addition to linear and constant mean functions, the toolbox offers m(x) = 0 and m(x) = 1. These simple mean functions can be combined by composite mean functions to obtain sums (mean/meanSum.m) m(x) = ∑ j m j (x), products m(x) = ∏ j m j (x), scaled versions m(x) = αm0 (x) and powers m(x) = m0 (x)d . This ﬂexible mechanism is used for convenient speciﬁcation of an extensible algebra of mean functions. Note that functions are referred to either as name strings ’meanConst’ or alternatively function handles @meanConst. The order of components of the hyperparameters φ is the same as in the speciﬁcation of the cell array. Every mean function implements its evaluation m = mφ (X) and ﬁrst derivative ∂ computation mi = ∂φi mφ (X) on a data set X. In the same spirit, the squared exponential covariance kψ (x, x′ ) = σ f ² exp(− x − x′ 2 /2ℓ2 ) (cov/covSEiso.m) with hyperparameters ψ = {ln ℓ, ln σ f } is set up in line 2. Note, that the hyperparameters are represented by the logarithms, as these parameters are naturally positive. Many other simple covariance functions are contained in the toolbox. Among others, we offer linear, constant, Mat´ rn, rational quadratic, polynomial, periodic, neural network and ﬁnite support coe variance functions. Composite covariance functions allow for sums k(x, x′ ) = ∑ j k j (x, x′ ), products k(x, x′ ) = ∏ j k j (x, x′ ), positive scaling k(x, x′ ) = σ2 k0 (x, x′ ) and masking of components f k(x, x′ ) = k0 (xI , x′ ) with I ⊆ [1, 2, .., D], x ∈ RD . Again, the interface is simple since only the I ∂ evaluation of the covariance matrix K = kψ (X) and its derivatives ∂i K = ∂ψi kψ (X) on a data set X are required. Furthermore, we need cross terms k∗ = kψ (X, x∗ ) and k∗∗ = kψ (x∗ , x∗ ) for prediction. There are no restrictions on the composition of both mean and covariance functions—any combination is allowed including nested composition. 3013 R ASMUSSEN AND N ICKISCH √ √ The Laplace (lik/likLaplace.m) likelihood Pρ (y| f ) = exp(− 2/σn |y − f |)/ 2σn with hyperparameters ρ = {ln σn } is speciﬁed in line 3. There are only simple likelihood functions: Gaussian, Sech-squared, Laplacian and Student’s t for ordinary and sparse regression as well as the error and the logistic function for classiﬁcation. Again, the same inference code is used for any likelihood function. Although the speciﬁcation of likelihood functions is simple for the user, writing new likelihood functions is slightly more involved as different inference methods require access to different properties; for example, LA requires second derivatives and EP requires derivatives of moments. All hyperparameters θ = {φ, ψ, ρ} are stored in a struct hyp.{mean,cov,lik}, which is initialised in line 4; we select the approximate inference algorithm EP (inf/infEP.m) in line 5. We optimise the hyperparameters θ ≡ hyp by calling the CG optimiser (util/minimize.m) with initial value θ0 ≡ hyp0 in line 6 allowing at most N = 50 evaluations of the EP approximation to the marginal likelihood ZEP (θ) as done by gp.m. Here, D = (X, y) ≡ (X,y) is the training data where X = {x1 , .., xn } and y ∈ Rn . Under the hood, gp.m computes in every step a Gaussian ∂ posterior approximation and the derivatives ∂θ ln ZEP (θ) of the marginal likelihood by calling EP. Predictions with optimised hyperparameters are done in line 7, where we call gp.m with the unseen test inputs X∗ ≡ Xs as additional argument. As a result, we obtain the approximate marginal predictive mean E[P(y∗ |D , X∗ )] ≡ ymu and the predictive variance V[P(y∗ |D , X∗ )] ≡ ys2.

Exact inference and the FITC approximation support the Gaussian likelihood only. Variational Bayesian (VB) inference is applicable to all likelihoods. Expectation propagation (EP) for the Student’s t likelihood is inherently unstable due to its non-log-concavity. The Laplace approximation (LA) for Laplace likelihoods is not sensible due to the non-differentiable peak of the Laplace likelihood. Special care has been taken for the non-convex optimisation problem imposed by the combination Student’s t likelihood and LA. If the number of training examples is larger than a few thousand, dense matrix computations become too slow. We provide the FITC approximation for regression with Gaussian likelihood where ˜ instead of the exact covariance matrix K, a low-rank plus diagonal matrix K = Q + diag(K − Q) ⊤ K−1 K is used. The matrices K and K contain covariances and cross-covariances where Q = Ku uu u uu u of and between inducing inputs ui and data points x j . Using inf/infFITC.m together with any covariance function wrapped into cov/covFITC.m makes the computations feasible for large n.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Fang-Lan Huang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Kai-Wei Chang, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Maximum entropy (Maxent) is useful in natural language processing and many other areas. Iterative scaling (IS) methods are one of the most popular approaches to solve Maxent. With many variants of IS methods, it is difﬁcult to understand them and see the differences. In this paper, we create a general and uniﬁed framework for iterative scaling methods. This framework also connects iterative scaling and coordinate descent methods. We prove general convergence results for IS methods and analyze their computational complexity. Based on the proposed framework, we extend a coordinate descent method for linear SVM to Maxent.

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider learning formulations with non-convex objective functions that often occur in practical applications. There are two approaches to this problem: • Heuristic methods such as gradient descent that only ﬁnd a local minimum. A drawback of this approach is the lack of theoretical guarantee showing that the local minimum gives a good solution. • Convex relaxation such as L1 -regularization that solves the problem under some conditions. However it often leads to a sub-optimal solution in reality. This paper tries to remedy the above gap between theory and practice. In particular, we present a multi-stage convex relaxation scheme for solving problems with non-convex objective functions. For learning formulations with sparse regularization, we analyze the behavior of a speciﬁc multistage relaxation scheme. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the local solution obtained by this procedure is superior to the global solution of the standard L1 convex relaxation for learning sparse targets.

<p>Author: Choon Hui Teo, S.V.N. Vishwanthan, Alex J. Smola, Quoc V. Le</p><p>Abstract: A wide variety of machine learning problems can be described as minimizing a regularized risk functional, with different algorithms using different notions of risk and different regularizers. Examples include linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gaussian Processes, Logistic Regression, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), and Lasso amongst others. This paper describes the theory and implementation of a scalable and modular convex solver which solves all these estimation problems. It can be parallelized on a cluster of workstations, allows for data-locality, and can deal with regularizers such as L1 and L2 penalties. In addition to the uniﬁed framework we present tight convergence bounds, which show that our algorithm converges in O(1/ε) steps to ε precision for general convex problems and in O(log(1/ε)) steps for continuously differentiable problems. We demonstrate the performance of our general purpose solver on a variety of publicly available data sets.

<p>Author: Jianing Shi, Wotao Yin, Stanley Osher, Paul Sajda</p><p>Abstract: ℓ1 -regularized logistic regression, also known as sparse logistic regression, is widely used in machine learning, computer vision, data mining, bioinformatics and neural signal processing. The use of ℓ1 regularization attributes attractive properties to the classiﬁer, such as feature selection, robustness to noise, and as a result, classiﬁer generality in the context of supervised learning. When a sparse logistic regression problem has large-scale data in high dimensions, it is computationally expensive to minimize the non-differentiable ℓ1 -norm in the objective function. Motivated by recent work (Koh et al., 2007; Hale et al., 2008), we propose a novel hybrid algorithm based on combining two types of optimization iterations: one being very fast and memory friendly while the other being slower but more accurate. Called hybrid iterative shrinkage (HIS), the resulting algorithm is comprised of a ﬁxed point continuation phase and an interior point phase. The ﬁrst phase is based completely on memory efﬁcient operations such as matrix-vector multiplications, while the second phase is based on a truncated Newton’s method. Furthermore, we show that various optimization techniques, including line search and continuation, can signiﬁcantly accelerate convergence. The algorithm has global convergence at a geometric rate (a Q-linear rate in optimization terminology). We present a numerical comparison with several existing algorithms, including an analysis using benchmark data from the UCI machine learning repository, and show our algorithm is the most computationally efﬁcient without loss of accuracy.

<p>Author: Jianing Shi, Wotao Yin, Stanley Osher, Paul Sajda</p><p>Abstract: ℓ1 -regularized logistic regression, also known as sparse logistic regression, is widely used in machine learning, computer vision, data mining, bioinformatics and neural signal processing. The use of ℓ1 regularization attributes attractive properties to the classiﬁer, such as feature selection, robustness to noise, and as a result, classiﬁer generality in the context of supervised learning. When a sparse logistic regression problem has large-scale data in high dimensions, it is computationally expensive to minimize the non-differentiable ℓ1 -norm in the objective function. Motivated by recent work (Koh et al., 2007; Hale et al., 2008), we propose a novel hybrid algorithm based on combining two types of optimization iterations: one being very fast and memory friendly while the other being slower but more accurate. Called hybrid iterative shrinkage (HIS), the resulting algorithm is comprised of a ﬁxed point continuation phase and an interior point phase. The ﬁrst phase is based completely on memory efﬁcient operations such as matrix-vector multiplications, while the second phase is based on a truncated Newton’s method. Furthermore, we show that various optimization techniques, including line search and continuation, can signiﬁcantly accelerate convergence. The algorithm has global convergence at a geometric rate (a Q-linear rate in optimization terminology). We present a numerical comparison with several existing algorithms, including an analysis using benchmark data from the UCI machine learning repository, and show our algorithm is the most computationally efﬁcient without loss of accuracy.

<p>Author: Fang-Lan Huang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Kai-Wei Chang, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Maximum entropy (Maxent) is useful in natural language processing and many other areas. Iterative scaling (IS) methods are one of the most popular approaches to solve Maxent. With many variants of IS methods, it is difﬁcult to understand them and see the differences. In this paper, we create a general and uniﬁed framework for iterative scaling methods. This framework also connects iterative scaling and coordinate descent methods. We prove general convergence results for IS methods and analyze their computational complexity. Based on the proposed framework, we extend a coordinate descent method for linear SVM to Maxent. Results show that it is faster than existing iterative scaling methods.

<p>Author: Jörg Lücke, Julian Eggert</p><p>Abstract: We show how a preselection of hidden variables can be used to efﬁciently train generative models with binary hidden variables. The approach is based on Expectation Maximization (EM) and uses an efﬁciently computable approximation to the sufﬁcient statistics of a given model. The computational cost to compute the sufﬁcient statistics is strongly reduced by selecting, for each data point, the relevant hidden causes. The approximation is applicable to a wide range of generative models and provides an interpretation of the beneﬁts of preselection in terms of a variational EM approximation. To empirically show that the method maximizes the data likelihood, it is applied to different types of generative models including: a version of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), a model for non-linear component extraction (MCA), and a linear generative model similar to sparse coding. The derived algorithms are applied to both artiﬁcial and realistic data, and are compared to other models in the literature. We ﬁnd that the training scheme can reduce computational costs by orders of magnitude and allows for a reliable extraction of hidden causes.

<p>Author: Franz Pernkopf, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a simple order-based greedy heuristic for learning discriminative structure within generative Bayesian network classiﬁers. We propose two methods for establishing an order of N features. They are based on the conditional mutual information and classiﬁcation rate (i.e., risk), respectively. Given an ordering, we can ﬁnd a discriminative structure with O N k+1 score evaluations (where constant k is the tree-width of the sub-graph over the attributes). We present results on 25 data sets from the UCI repository, for phonetic classiﬁcation using the TIMIT database, for a visual surface inspection task, and for two handwritten digit recognition tasks. We provide classiﬁcation performance for both discriminative and generative parameter learning on both discriminatively and generatively structured networks. The discriminative structure found by our new procedures signiﬁcantly outperforms generatively produced structures, and achieves a classiﬁcation accuracy on par with the best discriminative (greedy) Bayesian network learning approach, but does so with a factor of ∼10-40 speedup. We also show that the advantages of generative discriminatively structured Bayesian network classiﬁers still hold in the case of missing features, a case where generative classiﬁers have an advantage over discriminative classiﬁers.

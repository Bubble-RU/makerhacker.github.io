<p>Author: Yevgeny Seldin, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: We derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for supervised and unsupervised learning models based on clustering, such as co-clustering, matrix tri-factorization, graphical models, graph clustering, and pairwise clustering.1 We begin with the analysis of co-clustering, which is a widely used approach to the analysis of data matrices. We distinguish among two tasks in matrix data analysis: discriminative prediction of the missing entries in data matrices and estimation of the joint probability distribution of row and column variables in co-occurrence matrices. We derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for the expected out-of-sample performance of co-clustering-based solutions for these two tasks. The analysis yields regularization terms that were absent in the previous formulations of co-clustering. The bounds suggest that the expected performance of co-clustering is governed by a trade-off between its empirical performance and the mutual information preserved by the cluster variables on row and column IDs. We derive an iterative projection algorithm for ﬁnding a local optimum of this trade-off for discriminative prediction tasks. This algorithm achieved stateof-the-art performance in the MovieLens collaborative ﬁltering task. Our co-clustering model can also be seen as matrix tri-factorization and the results provide generalization bounds, regularization terms, and new algorithms for this form of matrix factorization. The analysis of co-clustering is extended to tree-shaped graphical models, which can be used to analyze high dimensional tensors. According to the bounds, the generalization abilities of treeshaped graphical models depend on a trade-off between their empirical data ﬁt and the mutual information that is propagated up the tree levels. We also formulate weighted graph clustering as a prediction problem: given a subset of edge weights we analyze the ability of graph clustering to predict the remaining edge weights.

<p>Author: Pradeep Ravikumar, Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: The problem of computing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) conﬁguration is a central computational challenge associated with Markov random ﬁelds. There has been some focus on “tree-based” linear programming (LP) relaxations for the MAP problem. This paper develops a family of super-linearly convergent algorithms for solving these LPs, based on proximal minimization schemes using Bregman divergences. As with standard message-passing on graphs, the algorithms are distributed and exploit the underlying graphical structure, and so scale well to large problems. Our algorithms have a double-loop character, with the outer loop corresponding to the proximal sequence, and an inner loop of cyclic Bregman projections used to compute each proximal update. We establish convergence guarantees for our algorithms, and illustrate their performance via some simulations. We also develop two classes of rounding schemes, deterministic and randomized, for obtaining integral conﬁgurations from the LP solutions. Our deterministic rounding schemes use a “re-parameterization” property of our algorithms so that when the LP solution is integral, the MAP solution can be obtained even before the LP-solver converges to the optimum. We also propose graph-structured randomized rounding schemes applicable to iterative LP-solving algorithms in general. We analyze the performance of and report simulations comparing these rounding schemes.

<p>Author: Rahul Gupta, Sunita Sarawagi, Ajit A. Diwan</p><p>Abstract: Many structured information extraction tasks employ collective graphical models that capture interinstance associativity by coupling them with various clique potentials. We propose tractable families of such potentials that are invariant under permutations of their arguments, and call them symmetric clique potentials. We present three families of symmetric potentials—MAX, SUM, and MAJORITY . We propose cluster message passing for collective inference with symmetric clique potentials, and present message computation algorithms tailored to such potentials. Our ﬁrst message computation algorithm, called α-pass, is sub-quadratic in the clique size, outputs exact messages for 13 MAX , and computes 15 -approximate messages for Potts, a popular member of the SUM family. Empirically, it is upto two orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms based on graph-cuts or belief propagation. Our second algorithm, based on Lagrangian relaxation, operates on MAJORITY potentials and provides close to exact solutions while being two orders of magnitude faster. We show that the cluster message passing framework is more principled, accurate and converges faster than competing approaches. We extend our collective inference framework to exploit associativity of more general intradomain properties of instance labelings, which opens up interesting applications in domain adaptation. Our approach leads to signiﬁcant error reduction on unseen domains without incurring any overhead of model retraining.

<p>Author: Ariel Jaimovich, Ofer Meshi, Ian McGraw, Gal Elidan</p><p>Abstract: The FastInf C++ library is designed to perform memory and time efﬁcient approximate inference in large-scale discrete undirected graphical models. The focus of the library is propagation based approximate inference methods, ranging from the basic loopy belief propagation algorithm to propagation based on convex free energies. Various message scheduling schemes that improve on the standard synchronous or asynchronous approaches are included. Also implemented are a clique tree based exact inference, Gibbs sampling, and the mean ﬁeld algorithm. In addition to inference, FastInf provides parameter estimation capabilities as well as representation and learning of shared parameters. It offers a rich interface that facilitates extension of the basic classes to other inference and learning methods.

<p>Author: Jianing Shi, Wotao Yin, Stanley Osher, Paul Sajda</p><p>Abstract: ℓ1 -regularized logistic regression, also known as sparse logistic regression, is widely used in machine learning, computer vision, data mining, bioinformatics and neural signal processing. The use of ℓ1 regularization attributes attractive properties to the classiﬁer, such as feature selection, robustness to noise, and as a result, classiﬁer generality in the context of supervised learning. When a sparse logistic regression problem has large-scale data in high dimensions, it is computationally expensive to minimize the non-differentiable ℓ1 -norm in the objective function. Motivated by recent work (Koh et al., 2007; Hale et al., 2008), we propose a novel hybrid algorithm based on combining two types of optimization iterations: one being very fast and memory friendly while the other being slower but more accurate. Called hybrid iterative shrinkage (HIS), the resulting algorithm is comprised of a ﬁxed point continuation phase and an interior point phase. The ﬁrst phase is based completely on memory efﬁcient operations such as matrix-vector multiplications, while the second phase is based on a truncated Newton’s method. Furthermore, we show that various optimization techniques, including line search and continuation, can signiﬁcantly accelerate convergence. The algorithm has global convergence at a geometric rate (a Q-linear rate in optimization terminology). We present a numerical comparison with several existing algorithms, including an analysis using benchmark data from the UCI machine learning repository, and show our algorithm is the most computationally efﬁcient without loss of accuracy.

<p>Author: Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: We study losses for binary classiﬁcation and class probability estimation and extend the understanding of them from margin losses to general composite losses which are the composition of a proper loss with a link function. We characterise when margin losses can be proper composite losses, explicitly show how to determine a symmetric loss in full from half of one of its partial losses, introduce an intrinsic parametrisation of composite binary losses and give a complete characterisation of the relationship between proper losses and “classiﬁcation calibrated” losses. We also consider the question of the “best” surrogate binary loss. We introduce a precise notion of “best” and show there exist situations where two convex surrogate losses are incommensurable. We provide a complete explicit characterisation of the convexity of composite binary losses in terms of the link function and the weight function associated with the proper loss which make up the composite loss. This characterisation suggests new ways of “surrogate tuning” as well as providing an explicit characterisation of when Bregman divergences on the unit interval are convex in their second argument. Finally, in an appendix we present some new algorithm-independent results on the relationship between properness, convexity and robustness to misclassiﬁcation noise for binary losses and show that all convex proper losses are non-robust to misclassiﬁcation noise.

<p>Author: Gunnar Carlsson, Facundo Mémoli</p><p>Abstract: We study hierarchical clustering schemes under an axiomatic view. We show that within this framework, one can prove a theorem analogous to one of Kleinberg (2002), in which one obtains an existence and uniqueness theorem instead of a non-existence result. We explore further properties of this unique scheme: stability and convergence are established. We represent dendrograms as ultrametric spaces and use tools from metric geometry, namely the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, to quantify the degree to which perturbations in the input metric space affect the result of hierarchical methods.

<p>Author: Remco Bouckaert, Raymond Hemmecke, Silvia Lindner, Milan Studený</p><p>Abstract: The topic of the paper is computer testing of (probabilistic) conditional independence (CI) implications by an algebraic method of structural imsets. The basic idea is to transform (sets of) CI statements into certain integral vectors and to verify by a computer the corresponding algebraic relation between the vectors, called the independence implication. We interpret the previous methods for computer testing of this implication from the point of view of polyhedral geometry. However, the main contribution of the paper is a new method, based on linear programming (LP). The new method overcomes the limitation of former methods to the number of involved variables. We recall/describe the theoretical basis for all four methods involved in our computational experiments, whose aim was to compare the efﬁciency of the algorithms. The experiments show that the LP method is clearly the fastest one. As an example of possible application of such algorithms we show that testing inclusion of Bayesian network structures or whether a CI statement is encoded in an acyclic directed graph can be done by the algebraic method.

<p>Author: Jacek P. Dmochowski, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: The presence of asymmetry in the misclassiﬁcation costs or class prevalences is a common occurrence in the pattern classiﬁcation domain. While much interest has been devoted to the study of cost-sensitive learning techniques, the relationship between cost-sensitive learning and the speciﬁcation of the model set in a parametric estimation framework remains somewhat unclear. To that end, we differentiate between the case of the model including the true posterior, and that in which the model is misspeciﬁed. In the former case, it is shown that thresholding the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate is an asymptotically optimal solution to the risk minimization problem. On the other hand, under model misspeciﬁcation, it is demonstrated that thresholded ML is suboptimal and that the risk-minimizing solution varies with the misclassiﬁcation cost ratio. Moreover, we analytically show that the negative weighted log likelihood (Elkan, 2001) is a tight, convex upper bound of the empirical loss. Coupled with empirical results on several real-world data sets, we argue that weighted ML is the preferred cost-sensitive technique.

<p>Author: Ming Yuan, Marten Wegkamp</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of binary classiﬁcation with a reject option in which one can withhold the decision of classifying an observation at a cost lower than that of misclassiﬁcation. Since the natural loss function is non-convex so that empirical risk minimization easily becomes infeasible, the paper proposes minimizing convex risks based on surrogate convex loss functions. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for inﬁnite sample consistency (both risks share the same minimizer) is provided. Moreover, we show that the excess risk can be bounded through the excess surrogate risk under appropriate conditions. These bounds can be tightened by a generalized margin condition. The impact of the results is illustrated on several commonly used surrogate loss functions.

<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen, Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic grammars offer great ﬂexibility in modeling discrete sequential data like natural language text. Their symbolic component is amenable to inspection by humans, while their probabilistic component helps resolve ambiguity. They also permit the use of well-understood, generalpurpose learning algorithms. There has been an increased interest in using probabilistic grammars in the Bayesian setting. To date, most of the literature has focused on using a Dirichlet prior. The Dirichlet prior has several limitations, including that it cannot directly model covariance between the probabilistic grammar’s parameters. Yet, various grammar parameters are expected to be correlated because the elements in language they represent share linguistic properties. In this paper, we suggest an alternative to the Dirichlet prior, a family of logistic normal distributions. We derive an inference algorithm for this family of distributions and experiment with the task of dependency grammar induction, demonstrating performance improvements with our priors on a set of six treebanks in different natural languages. Our covariance framework permits soft parameter tying within grammars and across grammars for text in different languages, and we show empirical gains in a novel learning setting using bilingual, non-parallel data.

<p>Author: James Henderson, Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: We propose a class of Bayesian networks appropriate for structured prediction problems where the Bayesian network’s model structure is a function of the predicted output structure. These incremental sigmoid belief networks (ISBNs) make decoding possible because inference with partial output structures does not require summing over the unboundedly many compatible model structures, due to their directed edges and incrementally speciﬁed model structure. ISBNs are speciﬁcally targeted at challenging structured prediction problems such as natural language parsing, where learning the domain’s complex statistical dependencies beneﬁts from large numbers of latent variables. While exact inference in ISBNs with large numbers of latent variables is not tractable, we propose two efﬁcient approximations. First, we demonstrate that a previous neural network parsing model can be viewed as a coarse mean-ﬁeld approximation to inference with ISBNs. We then derive a more accurate but still tractable variational approximation, which proves effective in artiﬁcial experiments. We compare the effectiveness of these models on a benchmark natural language parsing task, where they achieve accuracy competitive with the state-of-the-art. The model which is a closer approximation to an ISBN has better parsing accuracy, suggesting that ISBNs are an appropriate abstract model of natural language grammar learning.

<p>Author: Konrad Rieck, Tammo Krueger, Ulf Brefeld, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Convolution kernels for trees provide simple means for learning with tree-structured data. The computation time of tree kernels is quadratic in the size of the trees, since all pairs of nodes need to be compared. Thus, large parse trees, obtained from HTML documents or structured network data, render convolution kernels inapplicable. In this article, we propose an effective approximation technique for parse tree kernels. The approximate tree kernels (ATKs) limit kernel computation to a sparse subset of relevant subtrees and discard redundant structures, such that training and testing of kernel-based learning methods are signiﬁcantly accelerated. We devise linear programming approaches for identifying such subsets for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, respectively. Empirically, the approximate tree kernels attain run-time improvements up to three orders of magnitude while preserving the predictive accuracy of regular tree kernels. For unsupervised tasks, the approximate tree kernels even lead to more accurate predictions by identifying relevant dimensions in feature space.

<p>Author: Alexander Clark, Rémi Eyraud, Amaury Habrard</p><p>Abstract: We present a polynomial update time algorithm for the inductive inference of a large class of context-free languages using the paradigm of positive data and a membership oracle. We achieve this result by moving to a novel representation, called Contextual Binary Feature Grammars (CBFGs), which are capable of representing richly structured context-free languages as well as some context sensitive languages. These representations explicitly model the lattice structure of the distribution of a set of substrings and can be inferred using a generalisation of distributional learning. This formalism is an attempt to bridge the gap between simple learnable classes and the sorts of highly expressive representations necessary for linguistic representation: it allows the learnability of a large class of context-free languages, that includes all regular languages and those context-free languages that satisfy two simple constraints. The formalism and the algorithm seem well suited to natural language and in particular to the modeling of ﬁrst language acquisition. Preliminary experimental results conﬁrm the effectiveness of this approach.

The majority of existing work on grammar induction has favoured model simplicity (and thus learnability) over representational capacity by using context free grammars and ﬁrst order dependency grammars, which are not sufﬁciently expressive to model many common linguistic constructions. We propose a novel compromise by inferring a probabilistic tree substitution grammar, a formalism which allows for arbitrarily large tree fragments and thereby better represent complex linguistic structures. To limit the model’s complexity we employ a Bayesian non-parametric prior which biases the model towards a sparse grammar with shallow productions. We demonstrate the model’s efﬁcacy on supervised phrase-structure parsing, where we induce a latent segmentation of the training treebank, and on unsupervised dependency grammar induction. In both cases the model uncovers interesting latent linguistic structures while producing competitive results.

<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen, Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic grammars offer great ﬂexibility in modeling discrete sequential data like natural language text. Their symbolic component is amenable to inspection by humans, while their probabilistic component helps resolve ambiguity. They also permit the use of well-understood, generalpurpose learning algorithms. There has been an increased interest in using probabilistic grammars in the Bayesian setting. To date, most of the literature has focused on using a Dirichlet prior. The Dirichlet prior has several limitations, including that it cannot directly model covariance between the probabilistic grammar’s parameters. Yet, various grammar parameters are expected to be correlated because the elements in language they represent share linguistic properties. In this paper, we suggest an alternative to the Dirichlet prior, a family of logistic normal distributions. We derive an inference algorithm for this family of distributions and experiment with the task of dependency grammar induction, demonstrating performance improvements with our priors on a set of six treebanks in different natural languages. Our covariance framework permits soft parameter tying within grammars and across grammars for text in different languages, and we show empirical gains in a novel learning setting using bilingual, non-parallel data.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Alexander Clark, Rémi Eyraud, Amaury Habrard</p><p>Abstract: We present a polynomial update time algorithm for the inductive inference of a large class of context-free languages using the paradigm of positive data and a membership oracle. We achieve this result by moving to a novel representation, called Contextual Binary Feature Grammars (CBFGs), which are capable of representing richly structured context-free languages as well as some context sensitive languages. These representations explicitly model the lattice structure of the distribution of a set of substrings and can be inferred using a generalisation of distributional learning. This formalism is an attempt to bridge the gap between simple learnable classes and the sorts of highly expressive representations necessary for linguistic representation: it allows the learnability of a large class of context-free languages, that includes all regular languages and those context-free languages that satisfy two simple constraints. The formalism and the algorithm seem well suited to natural language and in particular to the modeling of ﬁrst language acquisition. Preliminary experimental results conﬁrm the effectiveness of this approach.

<p>Author: Konrad Rieck, Tammo Krueger, Ulf Brefeld, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Convolution kernels for trees provide simple means for learning with tree-structured data. The computation time of tree kernels is quadratic in the size of the trees, since all pairs of nodes need to be compared. Thus, large parse trees, obtained from HTML documents or structured network data, render convolution kernels inapplicable. In this article, we propose an effective approximation technique for parse tree kernels. The approximate tree kernels (ATKs) limit kernel computation to a sparse subset of relevant subtrees and discard redundant structures, such that training and testing of kernel-based learning methods are signiﬁcantly accelerated. We devise linear programming approaches for identifying such subsets for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, respectively. Empirically, the approximate tree kernels attain run-time improvements up to three orders of magnitude while preserving the predictive accuracy of regular tree kernels. For unsupervised tasks, the approximate tree kernels even lead to more accurate predictions by identifying relevant dimensions in feature space.

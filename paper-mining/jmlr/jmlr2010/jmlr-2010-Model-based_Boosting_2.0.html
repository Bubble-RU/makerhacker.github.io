The package implements boosting for optimizing general risk functions using component-wise (penalized) least squares estimates or regression trees as base-learners for ﬁtting generalized linear, additive and interaction models to potentially high-dimensional data. Keywords: component-wise functional gradient descent, splines, decision trees 1. Overview The R add-on package mboost (Hothorn et al., 2010) implements tools for ﬁtting and evaluating a variety of regression and classiﬁcation models that have been suggested in machine learning and statistics. Optimization within the empirical risk minimization framework is performed via a component-wise functional gradient descent algorithm. The algorithm originates from the statistical view on boosting algorithms (Friedman et al., 2000; Bühlmann and Yu, 2003). The theory and its implementation in mboost allow for ﬁtting complex prediction models, taking potentially many interactions of features into account, as well as for ﬁtting additive and linear models. The model class the package deals with is best described by so-called structured additive regression (STAR) models, where some characteristic ξ of the conditional distribution of a response variable Y given features X is modeled through a regression function f of the features ξ(Y |X = x) = f (x). In order to facilitate parsimonious and interpretable models, the regression function f is structured, that is, restricted to additive functions f (x) = ∑ p f j (x). Each model component f j (x) might take only j=1 c 2010 Torsten Hothorn, Peter Bühlmann, Thomas Kneib, Matthias Schmid and Benjamin Hofner. H OTHORN , B ÜHLMANN , K NEIB , S CHMID AND H OFNER a subset of the features into account. Special cases are linear models f (x) = x⊤ β, additive models f (x) = ∑ p f j (x( j) ), where f j is a function of the jth feature x( j) only (smooth functions or j=1 stumps, for example) or a more complex function where f (x) is implicitly deﬁned as the sum of multiple decision trees including higher-order interactions. The latter case corresponds to boosting with trees. Combinations of these structures are also possible. The most important advantage of such a decomposition of the regression function is that each component of a ﬁtted model can be looked at and interpreted separately for gaining a better understanding of the model at hand. The characteristic ξ of the distribution depends on the measurement scale of the response Y and the scientiﬁc question to be answered. For binary or numeric variables, some function of the expectation may be appropriate, but also quantiles or expectiles may be interesting. The deﬁnition of ξ is determined by deﬁning a loss function ρ whose empirical risk is to be minimized under some algorithmic constraints (i.e., limited number of boosting iterations). The model is then ﬁtted using n p ( fˆ1 , . . . , fˆp ) = argmin ∑ wi ρ yi , ∑ f j (x) . ( f1 ,..., f p ) i=1 j=1 Here (yi , xi ), i = 1, . . . , n, are n training samples with responses yi and potentially high-dimensional feature vectors xi , and wi are some weights. The component-wise boosting algorithm starts with some offset for f and iteratively ﬁts residuals deﬁned by the negative gradient of the loss function evaluated at the current ﬁt by updating only the best model component in each iteration. The details have been described by Bühlmann and Yu (2003). Early stopping via resampling approaches or AIC leads to sparse models in the sense that only a subset of important model components f j deﬁnes the ﬁnal model. A more thorough introduction to boosting with applications in statistics based on version 1.0 of mboost is given by Bühlmann and Hothorn (2007). As of version 2.0, the package allows for ﬁtting models to binary, numeric, ordered and censored responses, that is, regression of the mean, robust regression, classiﬁcation (logistic and exponential loss), ordinal regression,1 quantile1 and expectile1 regression, censored regression (including Cox, Weibull1 , log-logistic1 or lognormal1 models) as well as Poisson and negative binomial regression1 for count data can be performed. Because the structure of the regression function f (x) can be chosen independently from the loss function ρ, interesting new models can be ﬁtted (e.g., in geoadditive regression, Kneib et al., 2009). 2. Design and Implementation The package incorporates an infrastructure for representing loss functions (so-called ‘families’), base-learners deﬁning the structure of the regression function and thus the model components f j , and a generic implementation of component-wise functional gradient descent. The main progress in version 2.0 is that only one implementation of the boosting algorithm is applied to all possible models (linear, additive, tree-based) and all families. Earlier versions were based on three implementations, one for linear models, one for additive models, and one for tree-based boosting. In comparison to the 1.0 series, the reduced code basis is easier to maintain, more robust and regression tests have been set-up in a more uniﬁed way. Speciﬁcally, the new code basis results in an enhanced and more user-friendly formula interface. In addition, convenience functions for hyperparameter selection, faster computation of predictions and improved visual model diagnostics are available. 1. Model family is new in version 2.0 or was added after the release of mboost 1.0. 2110 M ODEL - BASED B OOSTING 2.0 Currently implemented base-learners include component-wise linear models (where only one variable is updated in each iteration of the algorithm), additive models with quadratic penalties (e.g., for ﬁtting smooth functions via penalized splines, varying coefﬁcients or bi- and trivariate tensor product splines, Schmid and Hothorn, 2008), and trees. As a major improvement over the 1.0 series, computations on larger data sets (both with respect to the number of observations and the number of variables) are now facilitated by memory efﬁcient implementations of the base-learners, mostly by applying sparse matrix techniques (package Matrix, Bates and Mächler, 2009) and parallelization for a cross-validation-based choice of the number of boosting iterations (per default via package multicore, Urbanek, 2009). A more elaborate description of mboost 2.0 features is available from the mboost vignette.2 3. User Interface by Example We illustrate the main components of the user-interface by a small example on human body fat composition: Garcia et al. (2005) used a linear model for predicting body fat content by means of common anthropometric measurements that were obtained for n = 71 healthy German women. In addition, the women’s body composition was measured by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA). The aim is to describe the DXA measurements as a function of the anthropometric features. Here, we extend the linear model by i) an intrinsic variable selection via early stopping, ii) additional terms allowing for smooth deviations from linearity where necessary (by means of penalized splines orthogonalized to the linear effect, Kneib et al., 2009), iii) a possible interaction between two variables with known impact on body fat composition (hip and waist circumference) and iv) using a robust median regression approach instead of L2 risk. For the data (available as data frame bodyfat), the model structure is speciﬁed via a formula involving the base-learners corresponding to the different model components (linear terms: bols(); smooth terms: bbs(); interactions: btree()). The loss function (here, the check function for the 0.5 quantile) along with its negative gradient function are deﬁned by the QuantReg(0.5) family (Fenske et al., 2009). The model structure (speciﬁed using the formula fm), the data and the family are then passed to function mboost() for model ﬁtting:3 R> library(</p><p>Reference: <a title="jmlr-2010-77-reference" href="../jmlr2010_reference/jmlr-2010-Model-based_Boosting_2.0_reference.html">text</a></p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 DE Institut für Medizininformatik, Biometrie und Epidemiologie FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg DE-91054 Erlangen  Editor: Mikio Braun  Abstract We describe version 2.

<p>Author: Isabelle Guyon, Amir Saffari, Gideon Dror, Gavin Cawley</p><p>Abstract: The principle of parsimony also known as “Ockham’s razor” has inspired many theories of model selection.

<p>Author: Gavin C. Cawley, Nicola L. C. Talbot</p><p>Abstract: Model selection strategies for machine learning algorithms typically involve the numerical optimisation of an appropriate model selection criterion, often based on an estimator of generalisation performance, such as k-fold cross-validation. The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneﬁcial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a nonnegligible variance introduces the potential for over-ﬁtting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-ﬁtting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-ﬁtting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-ﬁtting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-ﬁtting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the ﬁndings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a ﬁnite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds.

<p>Author: Ming Yuan</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating a high dimensional inverse covariance matrix that can be well approximated by “sparse” matrices. Taking advantage of the connection between multivariate linear regression and entries of the inverse covariance matrix, we propose an estimating procedure that can effectively exploit such “sparsity”. The proposed method can be computed using linear programming and therefore has the potential to be used in very high dimensional problems. Oracle inequalities are established for the estimation error in terms of several operator norms, showing that the method is adaptive to different types of sparsity of the problem.

<p>Author: Ming Yuan, Marten Wegkamp</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of binary classiﬁcation with a reject option in which one can withhold the decision of classifying an observation at a cost lower than that of misclassiﬁcation. Since the natural loss function is non-convex so that empirical risk minimization easily becomes infeasible, the paper proposes minimizing convex risks based on surrogate convex loss functions. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for inﬁnite sample consistency (both risks share the same minimizer) is provided. Moreover, we show that the excess risk can be bounded through the excess surrogate risk under appropriate conditions. These bounds can be tightened by a generalized margin condition. The impact of the results is illustrated on several commonly used surrogate loss functions.

<p>Author: Torsten Hothorn, Peter Bühlmann, Thomas Kneib, Matthias Schmid, Benjamin Hofner</p><p>Abstract: We describe version 2.0 of the R add-on package mboost. The package implements boosting for optimizing general risk functions using component-wise (penalized) least squares estimates or regression trees as base-learners for ﬁtting generalized linear, additive and interaction models to potentially high-dimensional data. Keywords: component-wise functional gradient descent, splines, decision trees 1. Overview The R add-on package mboost (Hothorn et al., 2010) implements tools for ﬁtting and evaluating a variety of regression and classiﬁcation models that have been suggested in machine learning and statistics. Optimization within the empirical risk minimization framework is performed via a component-wise functional gradient descent algorithm. The algorithm originates from the statistical view on boosting algorithms (Friedman et al., 2000; Bühlmann and Yu, 2003). The theory and its implementation in mboost allow for ﬁtting complex prediction models, taking potentially many interactions of features into account, as well as for ﬁtting additive and linear models. The model class the package deals with is best described by so-called structured additive regression (STAR) models, where some characteristic ξ of the conditional distribution of a response variable Y given features X is modeled through a regression function f of the features ξ(Y |X = x) = f (x). In order to facilitate parsimonious and interpretable models, the regression function f is structured, that is, restricted to additive functions f (x) = ∑ p f j (x). Each model component f j (x) might take only j=1 c 2010 Torsten Hothorn, Peter Bühlmann, Thomas Kneib, Matthias Schmid and Benjamin Hofner. H OTHORN , B ÜHLMANN , K NEIB , S CHMID AND H OFNER a subset of the features into account. Special cases are linear models f (x) = x⊤ β, additive models f (x) = ∑ p f j (x( j) ), where f j is a function of the jth feature x( j) only (smooth functions or j=1 stumps, for example) or a more complex function where f (x) is implicitly deﬁned as the sum of multiple decision trees including higher-order interactions. The latter case corresponds to boosting with trees. Combinations of these structures are also possible. The most important advantage of such a decomposition of the regression function is that each component of a ﬁtted model can be looked at and interpreted separately for gaining a better understanding of the model at hand. The characteristic ξ of the distribution depends on the measurement scale of the response Y and the scientiﬁc question to be answered. For binary or numeric variables, some function of the expectation may be appropriate, but also quantiles or expectiles may be interesting. The deﬁnition of ξ is determined by deﬁning a loss function ρ whose empirical risk is to be minimized under some algorithmic constraints (i.e., limited number of boosting iterations). The model is then ﬁtted using n p ( fˆ1 , . . . , fˆp ) = argmin ∑ wi ρ yi , ∑ f j (x) . ( f1 ,..., f p ) i=1 j=1 Here (yi , xi ), i = 1, . . . , n, are n training samples with responses yi and potentially high-dimensional feature vectors xi , and wi are some weights. The component-wise boosting algorithm starts with some offset for f and iteratively ﬁts residuals deﬁned by the negative gradient of the loss function evaluated at the current ﬁt by updating only the best model component in each iteration. The details have been described by Bühlmann and Yu (2003). Early stopping via resampling approaches or AIC leads to sparse models in the sense that only a subset of important model components f j deﬁnes the ﬁnal model. A more thorough introduction to boosting with applications in statistics based on version 1.0 of mboost is given by Bühlmann and Hothorn (2007). As of version 2.0, the package allows for ﬁtting models to binary, numeric, ordered and censored responses, that is, regression of the mean, robust regression, classiﬁcation (logistic and exponential loss), ordinal regression,1 quantile1 and expectile1 regression, censored regression (including Cox, Weibull1 , log-logistic1 or lognormal1 models) as well as Poisson and negative binomial regression1 for count data can be performed. Because the structure of the regression function f (x) can be chosen independently from the loss function ρ, interesting new models can be ﬁtted (e.g., in geoadditive regression, Kneib et al., 2009). 2. Design and Implementation The package incorporates an infrastructure for representing loss functions (so-called ‘families’), base-learners deﬁning the structure of the regression function and thus the model components f j , and a generic implementation of component-wise functional gradient descent. The main progress in version 2.0 is that only one implementation of the boosting algorithm is applied to all possible models (linear, additive, tree-based) and all families. Earlier versions were based on three implementations, one for linear models, one for additive models, and one for tree-based boosting. In comparison to the 1.0 series, the reduced code basis is easier to maintain, more robust and regression tests have been set-up in a more uniﬁed way. Speciﬁcally, the new code basis results in an enhanced and more user-friendly formula interface. In addition, convenience functions for hyperparameter selection, faster computation of predictions and improved visual model diagnostics are available. 1. Model family is new in version 2.0 or was added after the release of mboost 1.0. 2110 M ODEL - BASED B OOSTING 2.0 Currently implemented base-learners include component-wise linear models (where only one variable is updated in each iteration of the algorithm), additive models with quadratic penalties (e.g., for ﬁtting smooth functions via penalized splines, varying coefﬁcients or bi- and trivariate tensor product splines, Schmid and Hothorn, 2008), and trees. As a major improvement over the 1.0 series, computations on larger data sets (both with respect to the number of observations and the number of variables) are now facilitated by memory efﬁcient implementations of the base-learners, mostly by applying sparse matrix techniques (package Matrix, Bates and Mächler, 2009) and parallelization for a cross-validation-based choice of the number of boosting iterations (per default via package multicore, Urbanek, 2009). A more elaborate description of mboost 2.0 features is available from the mboost vignette.2 3. User Interface by Example We illustrate the main components of the user-interface by a small example on human body fat composition: Garcia et al. (2005) used a linear model for predicting body fat content by means of common anthropometric measurements that were obtained for n = 71 healthy German women. In addition, the women’s body composition was measured by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA). The aim is to describe the DXA measurements as a function of the anthropometric features. Here, we extend the linear model by i) an intrinsic variable selection via early stopping, ii) additional terms allowing for smooth deviations from linearity where necessary (by means of penalized splines orthogonalized to the linear effect, Kneib et al., 2009), iii) a possible interaction between two variables with known impact on body fat composition (hip and waist circumference) and iv) using a robust median regression approach instead of L2 risk. For the data (available as data frame bodyfat), the model structure is speciﬁed via a formula involving the base-learners corresponding to the different model components (linear terms: bols(); smooth terms: bbs(); interactions: btree()). The loss function (here, the check function for the 0.5 quantile) along with its negative gradient function are deﬁned by the QuantReg(0.5) family (Fenske et al., 2009). The model structure (speciﬁed using the formula fm), the data and the family are then passed to function mboost() for model ﬁtting:3 R> library(</p><p>2 0.34269807 <a title="77-lsi-2" href="./jmlr-2010-Model_Selection%3A_Beyond_the_Bayesian_Frequentist_Divide.html">78 jmlr-2010-Model Selection: Beyond the Bayesian Frequentist Divide</a></p>

<p>Author: Christoforos Christoforou, Robert Haralick, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: Traditional analysis methods for single-trial classiﬁcation of electro-encephalography (EEG) focus on two types of paradigms: phase-locked methods, in which the amplitude of the signal is used as the feature for classiﬁcation, that is, event related potentials; and second-order methods, in which the feature of interest is the power of the signal, that is, event related (de)synchronization. The process of deciding which paradigm to use is ad hoc and is driven by assumptions regarding the underlying neural generators. Here we propose a method that provides an uniﬁed framework for the analysis of EEG, combining ﬁrst and second-order spatial and temporal features based on a bilinear model. Evaluation of the proposed method on simulated data shows that the technique outperforms state-of-the art techniques for single-trial classiﬁcation for a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios. Evaluations on human EEG—including one benchmark data set from the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) competition—show statistically signiﬁcant gains in classiﬁcation accuracy, with a reduction in overall classiﬁcation error from 26%-28% to 19%.

<p>Author: Philippos Mordohai, Gérard Medioni</p><p>Abstract: We address instance-based learning from a perceptual organization standpoint and present methods for dimensionality estimation, manifold learning and function approximation. Under our approach, manifolds in high-dimensional spaces are inferred by estimating geometric relationships among the input instances. Unlike conventional manifold learning, we do not perform dimensionality reduction, but instead perform all operations in the original input space. For this purpose we employ a novel formulation of tensor voting, which allows an N-D implementation. Tensor voting is a perceptual organization framework that has mostly been applied to computer vision problems. Analyzing the estimated local structure at the inputs, we are able to obtain reliable dimensionality estimates at each instance, instead of a global estimate for the entire data set. Moreover, these local dimensionality and structure estimates enable us to measure geodesic distances and perform nonlinear interpolation for data sets with varying density, outliers, perturbation and intersections, that cannot be handled by state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative results on the estimation of local manifold structure using ground truth data are presented. In addition, we compare our approach with several leading methods for manifold learning at the task of measuring geodesic distances. Finally, we show competitive function approximation results on real data.

<p>Author: Torsten Hothorn, Peter Bühlmann, Thomas Kneib, Matthias Schmid, Benjamin Hofner</p><p>Abstract: We describe version 2.0 of the R add-on package mboost. The package implements boosting for optimizing general risk functions using component-wise (penalized) least squares estimates or regression trees as base-learners for ﬁtting generalized linear, additive and interaction models to potentially high-dimensional data. Keywords: component-wise functional gradient descent, splines, decision trees 1. Overview The R add-on package mboost (Hothorn et al., 2010) implements tools for ﬁtting and evaluating a variety of regression and classiﬁcation models that have been suggested in machine learning and statistics. Optimization within the empirical risk minimization framework is performed via a component-wise functional gradient descent algorithm. The algorithm originates from the statistical view on boosting algorithms (Friedman et al., 2000; Bühlmann and Yu, 2003). The theory and its implementation in mboost allow for ﬁtting complex prediction models, taking potentially many interactions of features into account, as well as for ﬁtting additive and linear models. The model class the package deals with is best described by so-called structured additive regression (STAR) models, where some characteristic ξ of the conditional distribution of a response variable Y given features X is modeled through a regression function f of the features ξ(Y |X = x) = f (x). In order to facilitate parsimonious and interpretable models, the regression function f is structured, that is, restricted to additive functions f (x) = ∑ p f j (x). Each model component f j (x) might take only j=1 c 2010 Torsten Hothorn, Peter Bühlmann, Thomas Kneib, Matthias Schmid and Benjamin Hofner. H OTHORN , B ÜHLMANN , K NEIB , S CHMID AND H OFNER a subset of the features into account. Special cases are linear models f (x) = x⊤ β, additive models f (x) = ∑ p f j (x( j) ), where f j is a function of the jth feature x( j) only (smooth functions or j=1 stumps, for example) or a more complex function where f (x) is implicitly deﬁned as the sum of multiple decision trees including higher-order interactions. The latter case corresponds to boosting with trees. Combinations of these structures are also possible. The most important advantage of such a decomposition of the regression function is that each component of a ﬁtted model can be looked at and interpreted separately for gaining a better understanding of the model at hand. The characteristic ξ of the distribution depends on the measurement scale of the response Y and the scientiﬁc question to be answered. For binary or numeric variables, some function of the expectation may be appropriate, but also quantiles or expectiles may be interesting. The deﬁnition of ξ is determined by deﬁning a loss function ρ whose empirical risk is to be minimized under some algorithmic constraints (i.e., limited number of boosting iterations). The model is then ﬁtted using n p ( fˆ1 , . . . , fˆp ) = argmin ∑ wi ρ yi , ∑ f j (x) . ( f1 ,..., f p ) i=1 j=1 Here (yi , xi ), i = 1, . . . , n, are n training samples with responses yi and potentially high-dimensional feature vectors xi , and wi are some weights. The component-wise boosting algorithm starts with some offset for f and iteratively ﬁts residuals deﬁned by the negative gradient of the loss function evaluated at the current ﬁt by updating only the best model component in each iteration. The details have been described by Bühlmann and Yu (2003). Early stopping via resampling approaches or AIC leads to sparse models in the sense that only a subset of important model components f j deﬁnes the ﬁnal model. A more thorough introduction to boosting with applications in statistics based on version 1.0 of mboost is given by Bühlmann and Hothorn (2007). As of version 2.0, the package allows for ﬁtting models to binary, numeric, ordered and censored responses, that is, regression of the mean, robust regression, classiﬁcation (logistic and exponential loss), ordinal regression,1 quantile1 and expectile1 regression, censored regression (including Cox, Weibull1 , log-logistic1 or lognormal1 models) as well as Poisson and negative binomial regression1 for count data can be performed. Because the structure of the regression function f (x) can be chosen independently from the loss function ρ, interesting new models can be ﬁtted (e.g., in geoadditive regression, Kneib et al., 2009). 2. Design and Implementation The package incorporates an infrastructure for representing loss functions (so-called ‘families’), base-learners deﬁning the structure of the regression function and thus the model components f j , and a generic implementation of component-wise functional gradient descent. The main progress in version 2.0 is that only one implementation of the boosting algorithm is applied to all possible models (linear, additive, tree-based) and all families. Earlier versions were based on three implementations, one for linear models, one for additive models, and one for tree-based boosting. In comparison to the 1.0 series, the reduced code basis is easier to maintain, more robust and regression tests have been set-up in a more uniﬁed way. Speciﬁcally, the new code basis results in an enhanced and more user-friendly formula interface. In addition, convenience functions for hyperparameter selection, faster computation of predictions and improved visual model diagnostics are available. 1. Model family is new in version 2.0 or was added after the release of mboost 1.0. 2110 M ODEL - BASED B OOSTING 2.0 Currently implemented base-learners include component-wise linear models (where only one variable is updated in each iteration of the algorithm), additive models with quadratic penalties (e.g., for ﬁtting smooth functions via penalized splines, varying coefﬁcients or bi- and trivariate tensor product splines, Schmid and Hothorn, 2008), and trees. As a major improvement over the 1.0 series, computations on larger data sets (both with respect to the number of observations and the number of variables) are now facilitated by memory efﬁcient implementations of the base-learners, mostly by applying sparse matrix techniques (package Matrix, Bates and Mächler, 2009) and parallelization for a cross-validation-based choice of the number of boosting iterations (per default via package multicore, Urbanek, 2009). A more elaborate description of mboost 2.0 features is available from the mboost vignette.2 3. User Interface by Example We illustrate the main components of the user-interface by a small example on human body fat composition: Garcia et al. (2005) used a linear model for predicting body fat content by means of common anthropometric measurements that were obtained for n = 71 healthy German women. In addition, the women’s body composition was measured by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA). The aim is to describe the DXA measurements as a function of the anthropometric features. Here, we extend the linear model by i) an intrinsic variable selection via early stopping, ii) additional terms allowing for smooth deviations from linearity where necessary (by means of penalized splines orthogonalized to the linear effect, Kneib et al., 2009), iii) a possible interaction between two variables with known impact on body fat composition (hip and waist circumference) and iv) using a robust median regression approach instead of L2 risk. For the data (available as data frame bodyfat), the model structure is speciﬁed via a formula involving the base-learners corresponding to the different model components (linear terms: bols(); smooth terms: bbs(); interactions: btree()). The loss function (here, the check function for the 0.5 quantile) along with its negative gradient function are deﬁned by the QuantReg(0.5) family (Fenske et al., 2009). The model structure (speciﬁed using the formula fm), the data and the family are then passed to function mboost() for model ﬁtting:3 R> library(</p><p>2 0.99405676 <a title="77-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2010-Continuous_Time_Bayesian_Network_Reasoning_and_Learning_Engine.html">28 jmlr-2010-Continuous Time Bayesian Network Reasoning and Learning Engine</a></p>

A continuous time Bayesian network (CTBN) provides a compact (factored) description of a continuoustime Markov process. This software provides libraries and programs for most of the algorithms developed for CTBNs. For learning, CTBN-RLE implements structure and parameter learning for both complete and partial data. For inference, it implements exact inference and Gibbs and importance sampling approximate inference for any type of evidence pattern. Additionally, the library supplies visualization methods for graphically displaying CTBNs or trajectories of evidence.

<p>Author: Kamaledin Ghiasi-Shirazi, Reza Safabakhsh, Mostafa Shamsi</p><p>Abstract: Appropriate selection of the kernel function, which implicitly deﬁnes the feature space of an algorithm, has a crucial role in the success of kernel methods. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing a kernel function over the class of translation invariant kernels for the task of binary classiﬁcation. The learning capacity of this class is invariant with respect to rotation and scaling of the features and it encompasses the set of radial kernels. We show that how translation invariant kernel functions can be embedded in a nested set of sub-classes and consider the kernel learning problem over one of these sub-classes. This allows the choice of an appropriate sub-class based on the problem at hand. We use the criterion proposed by Lanckriet et al. (2004) to obtain a functional formulation for the problem. It will be proven that the optimal kernel is a ﬁnite mixture of cosine functions. The kernel learning problem is then formulated as a semi-inﬁnite programming (SIP) problem which is solved by a sequence of quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) sub-problems. Using the fact that the cosine kernel is of rank two, we propose a formulation of a QCQP sub-problem which does not require the kernel matrices to be loaded into memory, making the method applicable to large-scale problems. We also address the issue of including other classes of kernels, such as individual kernels and isotropic Gaussian kernels, in the learning process. Another interesting feature of the proposed method is that the optimal classiﬁer has an expansion in terms of the number of cosine kernels, instead of support vectors, leading to a remarkable speedup at run-time. As a by-product, we also generalize the kernel trick to complex-valued kernel functions. Our experiments on artiﬁcial and real-world benchmark data sets, including the USPS and the MNIST digit recognition data sets, show the usefulness of the proposed method.

<p>Author: Jianing Shi, Wotao Yin, Stanley Osher, Paul Sajda</p><p>Abstract: ℓ1 -regularized logistic regression, also known as sparse logistic regression, is widely used in machine learning, computer vision, data mining, bioinformatics and neural signal processing. The use of ℓ1 regularization attributes attractive properties to the classiﬁer, such as feature selection, robustness to noise, and as a result, classiﬁer generality in the context of supervised learning. When a sparse logistic regression problem has large-scale data in high dimensions, it is computationally expensive to minimize the non-differentiable ℓ1 -norm in the objective function. Motivated by recent work (Koh et al., 2007; Hale et al., 2008), we propose a novel hybrid algorithm based on combining two types of optimization iterations: one being very fast and memory friendly while the other being slower but more accurate. Called hybrid iterative shrinkage (HIS), the resulting algorithm is comprised of a ﬁxed point continuation phase and an interior point phase. The ﬁrst phase is based completely on memory efﬁcient operations such as matrix-vector multiplications, while the second phase is based on a truncated Newton’s method. Furthermore, we show that various optimization techniques, including line search and continuation, can signiﬁcantly accelerate convergence. The algorithm has global convergence at a geometric rate (a Q-linear rate in optimization terminology). We present a numerical comparison with several existing algorithms, including an analysis using benchmark data from the UCI machine learning repository, and show our algorithm is the most computationally efﬁcient without loss of accuracy.

<p>Author: Patrick O. Perry, Art B. Owen</p><p>Abstract: In multivariate regression models we have the opportunity to look for hidden structure unrelated to the observed predictors. However, when one ﬁts a model involving such latent variables it is important to be able to tell if the structure is real, or just an artifact of correlation in the regression errors. We develop a new statistical test based on random rotations for verifying the existence of latent variables. The rotations are carefully constructed to rotate orthogonally to the column space of the regression model. We ﬁnd that only non-Gaussian latent variables are detectable, a ﬁnding that parallels a well known phenomenon in independent components analysis. We base our test on a measure of non-Gaussianity in the histogram of the principal eigenvector components instead of on the eigenvalue. The method ﬁnds and veriﬁes some latent dichotomies in the microarray data from the AGEMAP consortium.

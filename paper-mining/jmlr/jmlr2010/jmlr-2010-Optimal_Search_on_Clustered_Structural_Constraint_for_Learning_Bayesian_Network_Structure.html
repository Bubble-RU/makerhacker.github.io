<p>Author: Nguyen Xuan Vinh, Julien Epps, James Bailey</p><p>Abstract: Information theoretic measures form a fundamental class of measures for comparing clusterings, and have recently received increasing interest. Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning their properties and inter-relationships remain unresolved. In this paper, we perform an organized study of information theoretic measures for clustering comparison, including several existing popular measures in the literature, as well as some newly proposed ones. We discuss and prove their important properties, such as the metric property and the normalization property. We then highlight to the clustering community the importance of correcting information theoretic measures for chance, especially when the data size is small compared to the number of clusters present therein. Of the available information theoretic based measures, we advocate the normalized information distance (NID) as a general measure of choice, for it possesses concurrently several important properties, such as being both a metric and a normalized measure, admitting an exact analytical adjusted-for-chance form, and using the nominal [0, 1] range better than other normalized variants.

Koutsoukos</p><p>Abstract: In part I of this work we introduced and evaluated the Generalized Local Learning (GLL) framework for producing local causal and Markov blanket induction algorithms. In the present second part we analyze the behavior of GLL algorithms and provide extensions to the core methods. SpeciÄ?Ĺš cally, we investigate the empirical convergence of GLL to the true local neighborhood as a function of sample size. Moreover, we study how predictivity improves with increasing sample size. Then we investigate how sensitive are the algorithms to multiple statistical testing, especially in the presence of many irrelevant features. Next we discuss the role of the algorithm parameters and also show that Markov blanket and causal graph concepts can be used to understand deviations from optimality of state-of-the-art non-causal algorithms. The present paper also introduces the following extensions to the core GLL framework: parallel and distributed versions of GLL algorithms, versions with false discovery rate control, strategies for constructing novel heuristics for speciÄ?Ĺš c domains, and divide-and-conquer local-to-global learning (LGL) strategies. We test the generality of the LGL approach by deriving a novel LGL-based algorithm that compares favorably c 2010 Constantin F.

<p>Author: Constantin F. Aliferis, Alexander Statnikov, Ioannis Tsamardinos, Subramani Mani, Xenofon D. Koutsoukos</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithmic framework for learning local causal structure around target variables of interest in the form of direct causes/effects and Markov blankets applicable to very large data sets with relatively small samples. The selected feature sets can be used for causal discovery and classiÄ?Ĺš cation. The framework (Generalized Local Learning, or GLL) can be instantiated in numerous ways, giving rise to both existing state-of-the-art as well as novel algorithms. The resulting algorithms are sound under well-deÄ?Ĺš ned sufÄ?Ĺš cient conditions. In a Ä?Ĺš rst set of experiments we evaluate several algorithms derived from this framework in terms of predictivity and feature set parsimony and compare to other local causal discovery methods and to state-of-the-art non-causal feature selection methods using real data. A second set of experimental evaluations compares the algorithms in terms of ability to induce local causal neighborhoods using simulated and resimulated data and examines the relation of predictivity with causal induction performance. Our experiments demonstrate, consistently with causal feature selection theory, that local causal feature selection methods (under broad assumptions encompassing appropriate family of distribuc 2010 Constantin F. Aliferis, Alexander Statnikov, Ioannis Tsamardinos, Subramani Mani and Xenofon D. Koutsoukos. A LIFERIS , S TATNIKOV, T SAMARDINOS , M ANI AND KOUTSOUKOS tions, types of classiÄ?Ĺš ers, and loss functions) exhibit strong feature set parsimony, high predictivity and local causal interpretability. Although non-causal feature selection methods are often used in practice to shed light on causal relationships, we Ä?Ĺš nd that they cannot be interpreted causally even when they achieve excellent predictivity. Therefore we conclude that only local causal techniques should be used when insight into causal structure is sought.

<p>Author: Miloš Radovanović, Alexandros Nanopoulos, Mirjana Ivanović</p><p>Abstract: Different aspects of the curse of dimensionality are known to present serious challenges to various machine-learning methods and tasks. This paper explores a new aspect of the dimensionality curse, referred to as hubness, that affects the distribution of k-occurrences: the number of times a point appears among the k nearest neighbors of other points in a data set. Through theoretical and empirical analysis involving synthetic and real data sets we show that under commonly used assumptions this distribution becomes considerably skewed as dimensionality increases, causing the emergence of hubs, that is, points with very high k-occurrences which effectively represent “popular” nearest neighbors. We examine the origins of this phenomenon, showing that it is an inherent property of data distributions in high-dimensional vector space, discuss its interaction with dimensionality reduction, and explore its inﬂuence on a wide range of machine-learning tasks directly or indirectly based on measuring distances, belonging to supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning families.

<p>Author: Shyam Visweswaran, Gregory F. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian algorithm for constructing predictive models from data that are optimized to predict a target variable well for a particular instance. This algorithm learns Markov blanket models, carries out Bayesian model averaging over a set of models to predict a target variable of the instance at hand, and employs an instance-speciﬁc heuristic to locate a set of suitable models to average over. We call this method the instance-speciﬁc Markov blanket (ISMB) algorithm. The ISMB algorithm was evaluated on 21 UCI data sets using ﬁve different performance measures and its performance was compared to that of several commonly used predictive algorithms, including nave Bayes, C4.5 decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks, k-Nearest Neighbor, Lazy Bayesian Rules, and AdaBoost. Over all the data sets, the ISMB algorithm performed better on average on all performance measures against all the comparison algorithms.

<p>Author: Kaname Kojima, Eric Perrier, Seiya Imoto, Satoru Miyano</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning an optimal Bayesian network in a constrained search space; skeletons are compelled to be subgraphs of a given undirected graph called the super-structure. The previously derived constrained optimal search (COS) remains limited even for sparse superstructures. To extend its feasibility, we propose to divide the super-structure into several clusters and perform an optimal search on each of them. Further, to ensure acyclicity, we introduce the concept of ancestral constraints (ACs) and derive an optimal algorithm satisfying a given set of ACs. Finally, we theoretically derive the necessary and sufﬁcient sets of ACs to be considered for ﬁnding an optimal constrained graph. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm can learn optimal Bayesian networks for some graphs containing several hundreds of vertices, and even for super-structures having a high average degree (up to four), which is a drastic improvement in feasibility over the previous optimal algorithm. Learnt networks are shown to largely outperform state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms both in terms of score and structural hamming distance.

<p>Author: Gilles Blanchard, Gyemin Lee, Clayton Scott</p><p>Abstract: A common setting for novelty detection assumes that labeled examples from the nominal class are available, but that labeled examples of novelties are unavailable. The standard (inductive) approach is to declare novelties where the nominal density is low, which reduces the problem to density level set estimation. In this paper, we consider the setting where an unlabeled and possibly contaminated sample is also available at learning time. We argue that novelty detection in this semi-supervised setting is naturally solved by a general reduction to a binary classiﬁcation problem. In particular, a detector with a desired false positive rate can be achieved through a reduction to Neyman-Pearson classiﬁcation. Unlike the inductive approach, semi-supervised novelty detection (SSND) yields detectors that are optimal (e.g., statistically consistent) regardless of the distribution on novelties. Therefore, in novelty detection, unlabeled data have a substantial impact on the theoretical properties of the decision rule. We validate the practical utility of SSND with an extensive experimental study. We also show that SSND provides distribution-free, learning-theoretic solutions to two well known problems in hypothesis testing. First, our results provide a general solution to the general two-sample problem, that is, the problem of determining whether two random samples arise from the same distribution. Second, a specialization of SSND coincides with the standard p-value approach to multiple testing under the so-called random effects model. Unlike standard rejection regions based on thresholded p-values, the general SSND framework allows for adaptation to arbitrary alternative distributions in multiple dimensions.

<p>Author: András György, Gábor Lugosi, György Ottucsàk</p><p>Abstract: We consider a sequential version of the classical bin packing problem in which items are received one by one. Before the size of the next item is revealed, the decision maker needs to decide whether the next item is packed in the currently open bin or the bin is closed and a new bin is opened. If the new item does not ﬁt, it is lost. If a bin is closed, the remaining free space in the bin accounts for a loss. The goal of the decision maker is to minimize the loss accumulated over n periods. We present an algorithm that has a cumulative loss not much larger than any strategy in a ﬁnite class of reference strategies for any sequence of items. Special attention is payed to reference strategies that use a ﬁxed threshold at each step to decide whether a new bin is opened. Some positive and negative results are presented for this case.

<p>Author: Vladimir Koltchinskii</p><p>Abstract: Sequential algorithms of active learning based on the estimation of the level sets of the empirical risk are discussed in the paper. Localized Rademacher complexities are used in the algorithms to estimate the sample sizes needed to achieve the required accuracy of learning in an adaptive way. Probabilistic bounds on the number of active examples have been proved and several applications to binary classiﬁcation problems are considered.

<p>Author: Ran El-Yaniv, Yair Wiener</p><p>Abstract: We consider selective classiﬁcation, a term we adopt here to refer to ‘classiﬁcation with a reject option.’ The essence in selective classiﬁcation is to trade-off classiﬁer coverage for higher accuracy. We term this trade-off the risk-coverage (RC) trade-off. Our main objective is to characterize this trade-off and to construct algorithms that can optimally or near optimally achieve the best possible trade-offs in a controlled manner. For noise-free models we present in this paper a thorough analysis of selective classiﬁcation including characterizations of RC trade-offs in various interesting settings.

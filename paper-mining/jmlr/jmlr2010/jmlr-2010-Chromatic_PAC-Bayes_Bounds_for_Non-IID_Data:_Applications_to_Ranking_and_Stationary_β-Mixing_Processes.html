<h1>20 jmlr-2010-Chromatic PAC-Bayes Bounds for Non-IID Data: Applications to Ranking and Stationary β-Mixing Processes</h1>

<p>Author: Yevgeny Seldin, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: We derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for supervised and unsupervised learning models based on clustering, such as co-clustering, matrix tri-factorization, graphical models, graph clustering, and pairwise clustering.1 We begin with the analysis of co-clustering, which is a widely used approach to the analysis of data matrices. We distinguish among two tasks in matrix data analysis: discriminative prediction of the missing entries in data matrices and estimation of the joint probability distribution of row and column variables in co-occurrence matrices. We derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for the expected out-of-sample performance of co-clustering-based solutions for these two tasks. The analysis yields regularization terms that were absent in the previous formulations of co-clustering. The bounds suggest that the expected performance of co-clustering is governed by a trade-off between its empirical performance and the mutual information preserved by the cluster variables on row and column IDs. We derive an iterative projection algorithm for ﬁnding a local optimum of this trade-off for discriminative prediction tasks. This algorithm achieved stateof-the-art performance in the MovieLens collaborative ﬁltering task. Our co-clustering model can also be seen as matrix tri-factorization and the results provide generalization bounds, regularization terms, and new algorithms for this form of matrix factorization. The analysis of co-clustering is extended to tree-shaped graphical models, which can be used to analyze high dimensional tensors. According to the bounds, the generalization abilities of treeshaped graphical models depend on a trade-off between their empirical data ﬁt and the mutual information that is propagated up the tree levels. We also formulate weighted graph clustering as a prediction problem: given a subset of edge weights we analyze the ability of graph clustering to predict the remaining edge weights.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis class used, independently of any algorithm. In contrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight generalization bounds that are tailored to speciﬁc learning algorithms by exploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory, existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the samples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence. This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a stationary ϕ-mixing or β-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in the study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between observations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based generalization bounds for stationary ϕ-mixing and β-mixing sequences. These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply to all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of stability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios. We also illustrate the application of our ϕ-mixing generalization bounds to general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression, Kernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel regularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms. These novel bounds can thus be viewed as the ﬁrst theoretical basis for the use of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios.

<p>Author: Qiang Wu, Justin Guinney, Mauro Maggioni, Sayan Mukherjee</p><p>Abstract: The problems of dimension reduction and inference of statistical dependence are addressed by the modeling framework of learning gradients. The models we propose hold for Euclidean spaces as well as the manifold setting. The central quantity in this approach is an estimate of the gradient of the regression or classiﬁcation function. Two quadratic forms are constructed from gradient estimates: the gradient outer product and gradient based diffusion maps. The ﬁrst quantity can be used for supervised dimension reduction on manifolds as well as inference of a graphical model encoding dependencies that are predictive of a response variable. The second quantity can be used for nonlinear projections that incorporate both the geometric structure of the manifold as well as variation of the response variable on the manifold. We relate the gradient outer product to standard statistical quantities such as covariances and provide a simple and precise comparison of a variety of supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We provide rates of convergence for both inference of informative directions as well as inference of a graphical model of variable dependencies.

<p>Author: Liva Ralaivola, Marie Szafranski, Guillaume Stempfel</p><p>Abstract: PAC-Bayes bounds are among the most accurate generalization bounds for classiﬁers learned from independently and identically distributed (IID) data, and it is particularly so for margin classiﬁers: there have been recent contributions showing how practical these bounds can be either to perform model selection (Ambroladze et al., 2007) or even to directly guide the learning of linear classiﬁers (Germain et al., 2009). However, there are many practical situations where the training data show some dependencies and where the traditional IID assumption does not hold. Stating generalization bounds for such frameworks is therefore of the utmost interest, both from theoretical and practical standpoints. In this work, we propose the ﬁrst—to the best of our knowledge—PAC-Bayes generalization bounds for classiﬁers trained on data exhibiting interdependencies. The approach undertaken to establish our results is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency graph that encodes the dependencies within the data, in sets of independent data, thanks to graph fractional covers. Our bounds are very general, since being able to ﬁnd an upper bound on the fractional chromatic number of the dependency graph is sufﬁcient to get new PAC-Bayes bounds for speciﬁc settings. We show how our results can be used to derive bounds for ranking statistics (such as AUC) and classiﬁers trained on data distributed according to a stationary β-mixing process. In the way, we show how our approach seamlessly allows us to deal with U-processes. As a side note, we also provide a PAC-Bayes generalization bound for classiﬁers learned on data from stationary ϕ-mixing distributions.

<p>Author: Irene Rodriguez-Lujan, Ramon Huerta, Charles Elkan, Carlos Santa Cruz</p><p>Abstract: Identifying a subset of features that preserves classiﬁcation accuracy is a problem of growing importance, because of the increasing size and dimensionality of real-world data sets. We propose a new feature selection method, named Quadratic Programming Feature Selection (QPFS), that reduces the task to a quadratic optimization problem. In order to limit the computational complexity of solving the optimization problem, QPFS uses the Nystr¨ m method for approximate matrix diago onalization. QPFS is thus capable of dealing with very large data sets, for which the use of other methods is computationally expensive. In experiments with small and medium data sets, the QPFS method leads to classiﬁcation accuracy similar to that of other successful techniques. For large data sets, QPFS is superior in terms of computational efﬁciency.

<p>Author: Marina Meilă, Le Bao</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a statistical model for expressing preferences through rankings, when the number of alternatives (items to rank) is large. A human ranker will then typically rank only the most preferred items, and may not even examine the whole set of items, or know how many they are. Similarly, a user presented with the ranked output of a search engine, will only consider the highest ranked items. We model such situations by introducing a stagewise ranking model that operates with ﬁnite ordered lists called top-t orderings over an inﬁnite space of items. We give algorithms to estimate this model from data, and demonstrate that it has sufﬁcient statistics, being thus an exponential family model with continuous and discrete parameters. We describe its conjugate prior and other statistical properties. Then, we extend the estimation problem to multimodal data by introducing an Exponential-Blurring-Mean-Shift nonparametric clustering algorithm. The experiments highlight the properties of our model and demonstrate that inﬁnite models over permutations can be simple, elegant and practical.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Fabian Sinz, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new family of probability densities called L p -nested symmetric distributions. The common property, shared by all members of the new class, is the same functional form ˜ x x ρ(x ) = ρ( f (x )), where f is a nested cascade of L p -norms x p = (∑ |xi | p )1/p . L p -nested symmetric distributions thereby are a special case of ν-spherical distributions for which f is only required to be positively homogeneous of degree one. While both, ν-spherical and L p -nested symmetric distributions, contain many widely used families of probability models such as the Gaussian, spherically and elliptically symmetric distributions, L p -spherically symmetric distributions, and certain types of independent component analysis (ICA) and independent subspace analysis (ISA) models, ν-spherical distributions are usually computationally intractable. Here we demonstrate that L p nested symmetric distributions are still computationally feasible by deriving an analytic expression for its normalization constant, gradients for maximum likelihood estimation, analytic expressions for certain types of marginals, as well as an exact and efﬁcient sampling algorithm. We discuss the tight links of L p -nested symmetric distributions to well known machine learning methods such as ICA, ISA and mixed norm regularizers, and introduce the nested radial factorization algorithm (NRF), which is a form of non-linear ICA that transforms any linearly mixed, non-factorial L p nested symmetric source into statistically independent signals. As a corollary, we also introduce the uniform distribution on the L p -nested unit sphere.

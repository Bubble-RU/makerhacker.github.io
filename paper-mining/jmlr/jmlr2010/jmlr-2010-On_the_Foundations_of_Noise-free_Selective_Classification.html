<p>Author: Ming Yuan, Marten Wegkamp</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of binary classiﬁcation with a reject option in which one can withhold the decision of classifying an observation at a cost lower than that of misclassiﬁcation. Since the natural loss function is non-convex so that empirical risk minimization easily becomes infeasible, the paper proposes minimizing convex risks based on surrogate convex loss functions. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for inﬁnite sample consistency (both risks share the same minimizer) is provided. Moreover, we show that the excess risk can be bounded through the excess surrogate risk under appropriate conditions. These bounds can be tightened by a generalized margin condition. The impact of the results is illustrated on several commonly used surrogate loss functions.

<p>Author: Choon Hui Teo, S.V.N. Vishwanthan, Alex J. Smola, Quoc V. Le</p><p>Abstract: A wide variety of machine learning problems can be described as minimizing a regularized risk functional, with different algorithms using different notions of risk and different regularizers. Examples include linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gaussian Processes, Logistic Regression, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), and Lasso amongst others. This paper describes the theory and implementation of a scalable and modular convex solver which solves all these estimation problems. It can be parallelized on a cluster of workstations, allows for data-locality, and can deal with regularizers such as L1 and L2 penalties. In addition to the uniﬁed framework we present tight convergence bounds, which show that our algorithm converges in O(1/ε) steps to ε precision for general convex problems and in O(log(1/ε)) steps for continuously differentiable problems. We demonstrate the performance of our general purpose solver on a variety of publicly available data sets.

<p>Author: Lin Xiao</p><p>Abstract: We consider regularized stochastic learning and online optimization problems, where the objective function is the sum of two convex terms: one is the loss function of the learning task, and the other is a simple regularization term such as ℓ1 -norm for promoting sparsity. We develop extensions of Nesterov’s dual averaging method, that can exploit the regularization structure in an online setting. At each iteration of these methods, the learning variables are adjusted by solving a simple minimization problem that involves the running average of all past subgradients of the loss function and the whole regularization term, not just its subgradient. In the case of ℓ1 -regularization, our method is particularly effective in obtaining sparse solutions. We show that these methods achieve the optimal convergence rates or regret bounds that are standard in the literature on stochastic and online convex optimization. For stochastic learning problems in which the loss functions have Lipschitz continuous gradients, we also present an accelerated version of the dual averaging method.

<p>Author: Markus Ojala, Gemma C. Garriga</p><p>Abstract: We explore the framework of permutation-based p-values for assessing the performance of classiﬁers. In this paper we study two simple permutation tests. The ﬁrst test assess whether the classiﬁer has found a real class structure in the data; the corresponding null distribution is estimated by permuting the labels in the data. This test has been used extensively in classiﬁcation problems in computational biology. The second test studies whether the classiﬁer is exploiting the dependency between the features in classiﬁcation; the corresponding null distribution is estimated by permuting the features within classes, inspired by restricted randomization techniques traditionally used in statistics. This new test can serve to identify descriptive features which can be valuable information in improving the classiﬁer performance. We study the properties of these tests and present an extensive empirical evaluation on real and synthetic data. Our analysis shows that studying the classiﬁer performance via permutation tests is effective. In particular, the restricted permutation test clearly reveals whether the classiﬁer exploits the interdependency between the features in the data.

<p>Author: Michel Journée, Yurii Nesterov, Peter Richtárik, Rodolphe Sepulchre</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop a new approach to sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA). We propose two single-unit and two block optimization formulations of the sparse PCA problem, aimed at extracting a single sparse dominant principal component of a data matrix, or more components at once, respectively. While the initial formulations involve nonconvex functions, and are therefore computationally intractable, we rewrite them into the form of an optimization program involving maximization of a convex function on a compact set. The dimension of the search space is decreased enormously if the data matrix has many more columns (variables) than rows. We then propose and analyze a simple gradient method suited for the task. It appears that our algorithm has best convergence properties in the case when either the objective function or the feasible set are strongly convex, which is the case with our single-unit formulations and can be enforced in the block case. Finally, we demonstrate numerically on a set of random and gene expression test problems that our approach outperforms existing algorithms both in quality of the obtained solution and in computational speed.

<p>Author: Miguel Lázaro-Gredilla, Joaquin Quiñonero-Candela, Carl Edward Rasmussen, Aníbal R. Figueiras-Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We present a new sparse Gaussian Process (GP) model for regression. The key novel idea is to sparsify the spectral representation of the GP. This leads to a simple, practical algorithm for regression tasks. We compare the achievable trade-offs between predictive accuracy and computational requirements, and show that these are typically superior to existing state-of-the-art sparse approximations. We discuss both the weight space and function space representations, and note that the new construction implies priors over functions which are always stationary, and can approximate any covariance function in this class.

<p>Author: Shyam Visweswaran, Gregory F. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian algorithm for constructing predictive models from data that are optimized to predict a target variable well for a particular instance. This algorithm learns Markov blanket models, carries out Bayesian model averaging over a set of models to predict a target variable of the instance at hand, and employs an instance-speciﬁc heuristic to locate a set of suitable models to average over. We call this method the instance-speciﬁc Markov blanket (ISMB) algorithm. The ISMB algorithm was evaluated on 21 UCI data sets using ﬁve different performance measures and its performance was compared to that of several commonly used predictive algorithms, including nave Bayes, C4.5 decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks, k-Nearest Neighbor, Lazy Bayesian Rules, and AdaBoost. Over all the data sets, the ISMB algorithm performed better on average on all performance measures against all the comparison algorithms.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Fabian Sinz, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new family of probability densities called L p -nested symmetric distributions. The common property, shared by all members of the new class, is the same functional form ˜ x x ρ(x ) = ρ( f (x )), where f is a nested cascade of L p -norms x p = (∑ |xi | p )1/p . L p -nested symmetric distributions thereby are a special case of ν-spherical distributions for which f is only required to be positively homogeneous of degree one. While both, ν-spherical and L p -nested symmetric distributions, contain many widely used families of probability models such as the Gaussian, spherically and elliptically symmetric distributions, L p -spherically symmetric distributions, and certain types of independent component analysis (ICA) and independent subspace analysis (ISA) models, ν-spherical distributions are usually computationally intractable. Here we demonstrate that L p nested symmetric distributions are still computationally feasible by deriving an analytic expression for its normalization constant, gradients for maximum likelihood estimation, analytic expressions for certain types of marginals, as well as an exact and efﬁcient sampling algorithm. We discuss the tight links of L p -nested symmetric distributions to well known machine learning methods such as ICA, ISA and mixed norm regularizers, and introduce the nested radial factorization algorithm (NRF), which is a form of non-linear ICA that transforms any linearly mixed, non-factorial L p nested symmetric source into statistically independent signals. As a corollary, we also introduce the uniform distribution on the L p -nested unit sphere.

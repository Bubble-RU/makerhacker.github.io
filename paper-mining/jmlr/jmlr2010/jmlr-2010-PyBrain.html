<p>Author: Dumitru Erhan, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, Pierre-Antoine Manzagol, Pascal Vincent, Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Much recent research has been devoted to learning algorithms for deep architectures such as Deep Belief Networks and stacks of auto-encoder variants, with impressive results obtained in several areas, mostly on vision and language data sets. The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this difﬁcult learning problem. The main question investigated here is the following: how does unsupervised pre-training work? Answering this questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We propose several explanatory hypotheses and test them through extensive simulations. We empirically show the inﬂuence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples. The experiments conﬁrm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. The results suggest that unsupervised pretraining guides the learning towards basins of attraction of minima that support better generalization from the training data set; the evidence from these results supports a regularization explanation for the effect of pre-training.

<p>Author: Phillip Verbancsics, Kenneth O. Stanley</p><p>Abstract: An important goal for machine learning is to transfer knowledge between tasks. For example, learning to play RoboCup Keepaway should contribute to learning the full game of RoboCup soccer. Previous approaches to transfer in Keepaway have focused on transforming the original representation to ﬁt the new task. In contrast, this paper explores the idea that transfer is most effective if the representation is designed to be the same even across different tasks. To demonstrate this point, a bird’s eye view (BEV) representation is introduced that can represent different tasks on the same two-dimensional map. For example, both the 3 vs. 2 and 4 vs. 3 Keepaway tasks can be represented on the same BEV. Yet the problem is that a raw two-dimensional map is high-dimensional and unstructured. This paper shows how this problem is addressed naturally by an idea from evolutionary computation called indirect encoding, which compresses the representation by exploiting its geometry. The result is that the BEV learns a Keepaway policy that transfers without further learning or manipulation. It also facilitates transferring knowledge learned in a different domain, Knight Joust, into Keepaway. Finally, the indirect encoding of the BEV means that its geometry can be changed without altering the solution. Thus static representations facilitate several kinds of transfer.</p><p>4 0.051527396 <a title="93-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2010-Near-optimal_Regret_Bounds_for_Reinforcement_Learning.html">79 jmlr-2010-Near-optimal Regret Bounds for Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Jaksch, Ronald Ortner, Peter Auer</p><p>Abstract: For undiscounted reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs) we consider the total regret of a learning algorithm with respect to an optimal policy. In order to describe the transition structure of an MDP we propose a new parameter: An MDP has diameter D if for any pair of states s, s′ there is a policy which moves from s to s′ in at most D steps (on average). √ ˜ We present a reinforcement learning algorithm with total regret O(DS AT ) after T steps for any unknown MDP with S states, A actions per state, and diameter D. A corresponding lower bound of √ Ω( DSAT ) on the total regret of any learning algorithm is given as well. These results are complemented by a sample complexity bound on the number of suboptimal steps taken by our algorithm. This bound can be used to achieve a (gap-dependent) regret bound that is logarithmic in T . Finally, we also consider a setting where the MDP is allowed to change a ﬁxed number of ℓ times. We present a modiﬁcation of our algorithm that is able to deal with this setting and show a √ ˜ regret bound of O(ℓ1/3 T 2/3 DS A).

<p>Author: Sören Sonnenburg, Gunnar Rätsch, Sebastian Henschel, Christian Widmer, Jonas Behr, Alexander Zien, Fabio de Bona, Alexander Binder, Christian Gehl, Vojtěch Franc</p><p>Abstract: We have developed a machine learning toolbox, called SHOGUN, which is designed for uniﬁed large-scale learning for a broad range of feature types and learning settings. It offers a considerable number of machine learning models such as support vector machines, hidden Markov models, multiple kernel learning, linear discriminant analysis, and more. Most of the speciﬁc algorithms are able to deal with several different data classes. We have used this toolbox in several applications from computational biology, some of them coming with no less than 50 million training examples and others with 7 billion test examples. With more than a thousand installations worldwide, SHOGUN is already widely adopted in the machine learning community and beyond. SHOGUN is , implemented in C++ and interfaces to MATLABTM R, Octave, Python, and has a stand-alone command line interface.

<p>Author: Pascal Vincent, Hugo Larochelle, Isabelle Lajoie, Yoshua Bengio, Pierre-Antoine Manzagol</p><p>Abstract: We explore an original strategy for building deep networks, based on stacking layers of denoising autoencoders which are trained locally to denoise corrupted versions of their inputs. The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classiﬁcation problems to yield signiﬁcantly lower classiﬁcation error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classiﬁers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations.

It has been shown that obtaining the maximum pole of zeta functions is related to the asymptotic form of the generalization error for hierarchical learning models (Watanabe, 2001a,b). The zeta function is deﬁned by using a Kullback function. We use two methods to obtain the maximum pole: a new eigenvalue analysis method and a recursive blowing up process. We show that these methods are effective for obtaining the asymptotic form of the generalization error of hierarchical learning models.

<p>Author: Arthur Gretton, László Györfi</p><p>Abstract: Three simple and explicit procedures for testing the independence of two multi-dimensional random variables are described. Two of the associated test statistics (L1 , log-likelihood) are deﬁned when the empirical distribution of the variables is restricted to ﬁnite partitions. A third test statistic is deﬁned as a kernel-based independence measure. Two kinds of tests are provided. Distributionfree strong consistent tests are derived on the basis of large deviation bounds on the test statistics: these tests make almost surely no Type I or Type II error after a random sample size. Asymptotically α-level tests are obtained from the limiting distribution of the test statistics. For the latter tests, the Type I error converges to a ﬁxed non-zero value α, and the Type II error drops to zero, for increasing sample size. All tests reject the null hypothesis of independence if the test statistics become large. The performance of the tests is evaluated experimentally on benchmark data.

<p>Author: Lin Xiao</p><p>Abstract: We consider regularized stochastic learning and online optimization problems, where the objective function is the sum of two convex terms: one is the loss function of the learning task, and the other is a simple regularization term such as ℓ1 -norm for promoting sparsity. We develop extensions of Nesterov’s dual averaging method, that can exploit the regularization structure in an online setting. At each iteration of these methods, the learning variables are adjusted by solving a simple minimization problem that involves the running average of all past subgradients of the loss function and the whole regularization term, not just its subgradient. In the case of ℓ1 -regularization, our method is particularly effective in obtaining sparse solutions. We show that these methods achieve the optimal convergence rates or regret bounds that are standard in the literature on stochastic and online convex optimization. For stochastic learning problems in which the loss functions have Lipschitz continuous gradients, we also present an accelerated version of the dual averaging method.

<p>Author: Evangelos Theodorou, Jonas Buchli, Stefan Schaal</p><p>Abstract: With the goal to generate more scalable algorithms with higher efﬁciency and fewer open parameters, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently moved towards combining classical techniques from optimal control and dynamic programming with modern learning techniques from statistical estimation theory. In this vein, this paper suggests to use the framework of stochastic optimal control with path integrals to derive a novel approach to RL with parameterized policies. While solidly grounded in value function estimation and optimal control based on the stochastic Hamilton-JacobiBellman (HJB) equations, policy improvements can be transformed into an approximation problem of a path integral which has no open algorithmic parameters other than the exploration noise. The resulting algorithm can be conceived of as model-based, semi-model-based, or even model free, depending on how the learning problem is structured. The update equations have no danger of numerical instabilities as neither matrix inversions nor gradient learning rates are required. Our new algorithm demonstrates interesting similarities with previous RL research in the framework of probability matching and provides intuition why the slightly heuristically motivated probability matching approach can actually perform well. Empirical evaluations demonstrate signiﬁcant performance improvements over gradient-based policy learning and scalability to high-dimensional control problems. Finally, a learning experiment on a simulated 12 degree-of-freedom robot dog illustrates the functionality of our algorithm in a complex robot learning scenario. We believe that Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2 ) offers currently one of the most efﬁcient, numerically robust, and easy to implement algorithms for RL based on trajectory roll-outs.

<p>Author: Constantin F. Aliferis, Alexander Statnikov, Ioannis Tsamardinos, Subramani Mani, Xenofon D. Koutsoukos</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithmic framework for learning local causal structure around target variables of interest in the form of direct causes/effects and Markov blankets applicable to very large data sets with relatively small samples. The selected feature sets can be used for causal discovery and classiÄ?Ĺš cation. The framework (Generalized Local Learning, or GLL) can be instantiated in numerous ways, giving rise to both existing state-of-the-art as well as novel algorithms. The resulting algorithms are sound under well-deÄ?Ĺš ned sufÄ?Ĺš cient conditions. In a Ä?Ĺš rst set of experiments we evaluate several algorithms derived from this framework in terms of predictivity and feature set parsimony and compare to other local causal discovery methods and to state-of-the-art non-causal feature selection methods using real data. A second set of experimental evaluations compares the algorithms in terms of ability to induce local causal neighborhoods using simulated and resimulated data and examines the relation of predictivity with causal induction performance. Our experiments demonstrate, consistently with causal feature selection theory, that local causal feature selection methods (under broad assumptions encompassing appropriate family of distribuc 2010 Constantin F.

Koutsoukos</p><p>Abstract: In part I of this work we introduced and evaluated the Generalized Local Learning (GLL) framework for producing local causal and Markov blanket induction algorithms. In the present second part we analyze the behavior of GLL algorithms and provide extensions to the core methods. SpeciÄ?Ĺš cally, we investigate the empirical convergence of GLL to the true local neighborhood as a function of sample size. Moreover, we study how predictivity improves with increasing sample size. Then we investigate how sensitive are the algorithms to multiple statistical testing, especially in the presence of many irrelevant features. Next we discuss the role of the algorithm parameters and also show that Markov blanket and causal graph concepts can be used to understand deviations from optimality of state-of-the-art non-causal algorithms. The present paper also introduces the following extensions to the core GLL framework: parallel and distributed versions of GLL algorithms, versions with false discovery rate control, strategies for constructing novel heuristics for speciÄ?Ĺš c domains, and divide-and-conquer local-to-global learning (LGL) strategies. We test the generality of the LGL approach by deriving a novel LGL-based algorithm that compares favorably c 2010 Constantin F.

<p>Author: Franz Pernkopf, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a simple order-based greedy heuristic for learning discriminative structure within generative Bayesian network classiﬁers. We propose two methods for establishing an order of N features. They are based on the conditional mutual information and classiﬁcation rate (i.e., risk), respectively. Given an ordering, we can ﬁnd a discriminative structure with O N k+1 score evaluations (where constant k is the tree-width of the sub-graph over the attributes). We present results on 25 data sets from the UCI repository, for phonetic classiﬁcation using the TIMIT database, for a visual surface inspection task, and for two handwritten digit recognition tasks. We provide classiﬁcation performance for both discriminative and generative parameter learning on both discriminatively and generatively structured networks. The discriminative structure found by our new procedures signiﬁcantly outperforms generatively produced structures, and achieves a classiﬁcation accuracy on par with the best discriminative (greedy) Bayesian network learning approach, but does so with a factor of ∼10-40 speedup. We also show that the advantages of generative discriminatively structured Bayesian network classiﬁers still hold in the case of missing features, a case where generative classiﬁers have an advantage over discriminative classiﬁers.

<p>Author: Yael Ben-Haim, Elad Tom-Tov</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for building decision tree classiﬁers. The algorithm is executed in a distributed environment and is especially designed for classifying large data sets and streaming data. It is empirically shown to be as accurate as a standard decision tree classiﬁer, while being scalable for processing of streaming data on multiple processors. These ﬁndings are supported by a rigorous analysis of the algorithm’s accuracy. The essence of the algorithm is to quickly construct histograms at the processors, which compress the data to a ﬁxed amount of memory. A master processor uses this information to ﬁnd near-optimal split points to terminal tree nodes. Our analysis shows that guarantees on the local accuracy of split points imply guarantees on the overall tree accuracy.

<p>Author: Kaname Kojima, Eric Perrier, Seiya Imoto, Satoru Miyano</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning an optimal Bayesian network in a constrained search space; skeletons are compelled to be subgraphs of a given undirected graph called the super-structure. The previously derived constrained optimal search (COS) remains limited even for sparse superstructures. To extend its feasibility, we propose to divide the super-structure into several clusters and perform an optimal search on each of them. Further, to ensure acyclicity, we introduce the concept of ancestral constraints (ACs) and derive an optimal algorithm satisfying a given set of ACs. Finally, we theoretically derive the necessary and sufﬁcient sets of ACs to be considered for ﬁnding an optimal constrained graph. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm can learn optimal Bayesian networks for some graphs containing several hundreds of vertices, and even for super-structures having a high average degree (up to four), which is a drastic improvement in feasibility over the previous optimal algorithm. Learnt networks are shown to largely outperform state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms both in terms of score and structural hamming distance.

<p>Author: Shyam Visweswaran, Gregory F. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian algorithm for constructing predictive models from data that are optimized to predict a target variable well for a particular instance. This algorithm learns Markov blanket models, carries out Bayesian model averaging over a set of models to predict a target variable of the instance at hand, and employs an instance-speciﬁc heuristic to locate a set of suitable models to average over. We call this method the instance-speciﬁc Markov blanket (ISMB) algorithm. The ISMB algorithm was evaluated on 21 UCI data sets using ﬁve different performance measures and its performance was compared to that of several commonly used predictive algorithms, including nave Bayes, C4.5 decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks, k-Nearest Neighbor, Lazy Bayesian Rules, and AdaBoost. Over all the data sets, the ISMB algorithm performed better on average on all performance measures against all the comparison algorithms.

<p>Author: Ran El-Yaniv, Yair Wiener</p><p>Abstract: We consider selective classiﬁcation, a term we adopt here to refer to ‘classiﬁcation with a reject option.’ The essence in selective classiﬁcation is to trade-off classiﬁer coverage for higher accuracy. We term this trade-off the risk-coverage (RC) trade-off. Our main objective is to characterize this trade-off and to construct algorithms that can optimally or near optimally achieve the best possible trade-offs in a controlled manner. For noise-free models we present in this paper a thorough analysis of selective classiﬁcation including characterizations of RC trade-offs in various interesting settings.

<p>Author: Miguel Lázaro-Gredilla, Joaquin Quiñonero-Candela, Carl Edward Rasmussen, Aníbal R. Figueiras-Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We present a new sparse Gaussian Process (GP) model for regression. The key novel idea is to sparsify the spectral representation of the GP. This leads to a simple, practical algorithm for regression tasks. We compare the achievable trade-offs between predictive accuracy and computational requirements, and show that these are typically superior to existing state-of-the-art sparse approximations. We discuss both the weight space and function space representations, and note that the new construction implies priors over functions which are always stationary, and can approximate any covariance function in this class.

<p>Author: Constantin F. Aliferis, Alexander Statnikov, Ioannis Tsamardinos, Subramani Mani, Xenofon D. Koutsoukos</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithmic framework for learning local causal structure around target variables of interest in the form of direct causes/effects and Markov blankets applicable to very large data sets with relatively small samples. The selected feature sets can be used for causal discovery and classiÄ?Ĺš cation. The framework (Generalized Local Learning, or GLL) can be instantiated in numerous ways, giving rise to both existing state-of-the-art as well as novel algorithms. The resulting algorithms are sound under well-deÄ?Ĺš ned sufÄ?Ĺš cient conditions. In a Ä?Ĺš rst set of experiments we evaluate several algorithms derived from this framework in terms of predictivity and feature set parsimony and compare to other local causal discovery methods and to state-of-the-art non-causal feature selection methods using real data. A second set of experimental evaluations compares the algorithms in terms of ability to induce local causal neighborhoods using simulated and resimulated data and examines the relation of predictivity with causal induction performance. Our experiments demonstrate, consistently with causal feature selection theory, that local causal feature selection methods (under broad assumptions encompassing appropriate family of distribuc 2010 Constantin F.

Although non-causal feature selection methods are often used in practice to shed light on causal relationships, we Ä?Ĺš nd that they cannot be interpreted causally even when they achieve excellent predictivity. Therefore we conclude that only local causal techniques should be used when insight into causal structure is sought.

<p>Author: Rahul Gupta, Sunita Sarawagi, Ajit A. Diwan</p><p>Abstract: Many structured information extraction tasks employ collective graphical models that capture interinstance associativity by coupling them with various clique potentials. We propose tractable families of such potentials that are invariant under permutations of their arguments, and call them symmetric clique potentials. We present three families of symmetric potentials—MAX, SUM, and MAJORITY . We propose cluster message passing for collective inference with symmetric clique potentials, and present message computation algorithms tailored to such potentials. Our ﬁrst message computation algorithm, called α-pass, is sub-quadratic in the clique size, outputs exact messages for 13 MAX , and computes 15 -approximate messages for Potts, a popular member of the SUM family. Empirically, it is upto two orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms based on graph-cuts or belief propagation. Our second algorithm, based on Lagrangian relaxation, operates on MAJORITY potentials and provides close to exact solutions while being two orders of magnitude faster. We show that the cluster message passing framework is more principled, accurate and converges faster than competing approaches. We extend our collective inference framework to exploit associativity of more general intradomain properties of instance labelings, which opens up interesting applications in domain adaptation. Our approach leads to signiﬁcant error reduction on unseen domains without incurring any overhead of model retraining.

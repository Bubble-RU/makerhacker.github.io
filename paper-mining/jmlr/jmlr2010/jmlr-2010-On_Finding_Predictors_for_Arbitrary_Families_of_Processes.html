<p>Author: Guo-Xun Yuan, Kai-Wei Chang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Large-scale linear classiﬁcation is widely used in many areas. The L1-regularized form can be applied for feature selection; however, its non-differentiability causes more difﬁculties in training. Although various optimization methods have been proposed in recent years, these have not yet been compared suitably. In this paper, we ﬁrst broadly review existing methods. Then, we discuss state-of-the-art software packages in detail and propose two efﬁcient implementations. Extensive comparisons indicate that carefully implemented coordinate descent methods are very suitable for training large document data.

<p>Author: Pedro A. Forero, Alfonso Cano, Georgios B. Giannakis</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops algorithms to train support vector machines when training data are distributed across different nodes, and their communication to a centralized processing unit is prohibited due to, for example, communication complexity, scalability, or privacy reasons. To accomplish this goal, the centralized linear SVM problem is cast as a set of decentralized convex optimization subproblems (one per node) with consensus constraints on the wanted classiﬁer parameters. Using the alternating direction method of multipliers, fully distributed training algorithms are obtained without exchanging training data among nodes. Different from existing incremental approaches, the overhead associated with inter-node communications is ﬁxed and solely dependent on the network topology rather than the size of the training sets available per node. Important generalizations to train nonlinear SVMs in a distributed fashion are also developed along with sequential variants capable of online processing.

<p>Author: Jitkomut Songsiri, Lieven Vandenberghe</p><p>Abstract: An algorithm is presented for topology selection in graphical models of autoregressive Gaussian time series. The graph topology of the model represents the sparsity pattern of the inverse spectrum of the time series and characterizes conditional independence relations between the variables. The method proposed in the paper is based on an ℓ1 -type nonsmooth regularization of the conditional maximum likelihood estimation problem. We show that this reduces to a convex optimization problem and describe a large-scale algorithm that solves the dual problem via the gradient projection method. Results of experiments with randomly generated and real data sets are also included.

<p>Author: Ido Cohn, Tal El-Hay, Nir Friedman, Raz Kupferman</p><p>Abstract: Continuous-time Bayesian networks is a natural structured representation language for multicomponent stochastic processes that evolve continuously over time. Despite the compact representation provided by this language, inference in such models is intractable even in relatively simple structured networks. We introduce a mean ﬁeld variational approximation in which we use a product of inhomogeneous Markov processes to approximate a joint distribution over trajectories. This variational approach leads to a globally consistent distribution, which can be efﬁciently queried. Additionally, it provides a lower bound on the probability of observations, thus making it attractive for learning tasks. Here we describe the theoretical foundations for the approximation, an efﬁcient implementation that exploits the wide range of highly optimized ordinary differential equations (ODE) solvers, experimentally explore characterizations of processes for which this approximation is suitable, and show applications to a large-scale real-world inference problem.

<p>Author: Liva Ralaivola, Marie Szafranski, Guillaume Stempfel</p><p>Abstract: PAC-Bayes bounds are among the most accurate generalization bounds for classiﬁers learned from independently and identically distributed (IID) data, and it is particularly so for margin classiﬁers: there have been recent contributions showing how practical these bounds can be either to perform model selection (Ambroladze et al., 2007) or even to directly guide the learning of linear classiﬁers (Germain et al., 2009). However, there are many practical situations where the training data show some dependencies and where the traditional IID assumption does not hold. Stating generalization bounds for such frameworks is therefore of the utmost interest, both from theoretical and practical standpoints. In this work, we propose the ﬁrst—to the best of our knowledge—PAC-Bayes generalization bounds for classiﬁers trained on data exhibiting interdependencies. The approach undertaken to establish our results is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency graph that encodes the dependencies within the data, in sets of independent data, thanks to graph fractional covers. Our bounds are very general, since being able to ﬁnd an upper bound on the fractional chromatic number of the dependency graph is sufﬁcient to get new PAC-Bayes bounds for speciﬁc settings. We show how our results can be used to derive bounds for ranking statistics (such as AUC) and classiﬁers trained on data distributed according to a stationary β-mixing process. In the way, we show how our approach seamlessly allows us to deal with U-processes. As a side note, we also provide a PAC-Bayes generalization bound for classiﬁers learned on data from stationary ϕ-mixing distributions.

<p>Author: Dotan Di Castro, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-Critic based approaches were among the ﬁrst to address reinforcement learning in a general setting. Recently, these algorithms have gained renewed interest due to their generality, good convergence properties, and possible biological relevance. In this paper, we introduce an online temporal difference based actor-critic algorithm which is proved to converge to a neighborhood of a local maximum of the average reward. Linear function approximation is used by the critic in order estimate the value function, and the temporal difference signal, which is passed from the critic to the actor. The main distinguishing feature of the present convergence proof is that both the actor and the critic operate on a similar time scale, while in most current convergence proofs they are required to have very different time scales in order to converge. Moreover, the same temporal difference signal is used to update the parameters of both the actor and the critic. A limitation of the proposed approach, compared to results available for two time scale convergence, is that convergence is guaranteed only to a neighborhood of an optimal value, rather to an optimal value itself. The single time scale and identical temporal difference signal used by the actor and the critic, may provide a step towards constructing more biologically realistic models of reinforcement learning in the brain.

The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Ryo Yoshida, Mike West</p><p>Abstract: We describe a class of sparse latent factor models, called graphical factor models (GFMs), and relevant sparse learning algorithms for posterior mode estimation. Linear, Gaussian GFMs have sparse, orthogonal factor loadings matrices, that, in addition to sparsity of the implied covariance matrices, also induce conditional independence structures via zeros in the implied precision matrices. We describe the models and their use for robust estimation of sparse latent factor structure and data/signal reconstruction. We develop computational algorithms for model exploration and posterior mode search, addressing the hard combinatorial optimization involved in the search over a huge space of potential sparse conﬁgurations. A mean-ﬁeld variational technique coupled with annealing is developed to successively generate “artiﬁcial” posterior distributions that, at the limiting temperature in the annealing schedule, deﬁne required posterior modes in the GFM parameter space. Several detailed empirical studies and comparisons to related approaches are discussed, including analyses of handwritten digit image and cancer gene expression data.

<p>Author: Lorenzo Rosasco, Mikhail Belkin, Ernesto De Vito</p><p>Abstract: A large number of learning algorithms, for example, spectral clustering, kernel Principal Components Analysis and many manifold methods are based on estimating eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of operators deﬁned by a similarity function or a kernel, given empirical data. Thus for the analysis of algorithms, it is an important problem to be able to assess the quality of such approximations. The contribution of our paper is two-fold: 1. We use a technique based on a concentration inequality for Hilbert spaces to provide new much simpliﬁed proofs for a number of results in spectral approximation. 2. Using these methods we provide several new results for estimating spectral properties of the graph Laplacian operator extending and strengthening results from von Luxburg et al. (2008).

<p>Author: Vicenç Gómez, Hilbert J. Kappen, Michael Chertkov</p><p>Abstract: We introduce novel results for approximate inference on planar graphical models using the loop calculus framework. The loop calculus (Chertkov and Chernyak, 2006a) allows to express the exact partition function of a graphical model as a ﬁnite sum of terms that can be evaluated once the belief propagation (BP) solution is known. In general, full summation over all correction terms is intractable. We develop an algorithm for the approach presented in Chertkov et al. (2008) which represents an efﬁcient truncation scheme on planar graphs and a new representation of the series in terms of Pfafﬁans of matrices. We analyze the performance of the algorithm for models with binary variables and pairwise interactions on grids and other planar graphs. We study in detail both the loop series and the equivalent Pfafﬁan series and show that the ﬁrst term of the Pfafﬁan series for the general, intractable planar model, can provide very accurate approximations. The algorithm outperforms previous truncation schemes of the loop series and is competitive with other state of the art methods for approximate inference.

<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev, João Graça, Jennifer Gillenwater, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We present posterior regularization, a probabilistic framework for structured, weakly supervised learning. Our framework efﬁciently incorporates indirect supervision via constraints on posterior distributions of probabilistic models with latent variables. Posterior regularization separates model complexity from the complexity of structural constraints it is desired to satisfy. By directly imposing decomposable regularization on the posterior moments of latent variables during learning, we retain the computational efﬁciency of the unconstrained model while ensuring desired constraints hold in expectation. We present an efﬁcient algorithm for learning with posterior regularization and illustrate its versatility on a diverse set of structural constraints such as bijectivity, symmetry and group sparsity in several large scale experiments, including multi-view learning, cross-lingual dependency grammar induction, unsupervised part-of-speech induction, and bitext word alignment.1 Keywords: posterior regularization framework, unsupervised learning, latent variables models, prior knowledge, natural language processing</p><p>6 0.52300352 <a title="81-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2010-Hilbert_Space_Embeddings_and_Metrics_on_Probability_Measures.html">47 jmlr-2010-Hilbert Space Embeddings and Metrics on Probability Measures</a></p>

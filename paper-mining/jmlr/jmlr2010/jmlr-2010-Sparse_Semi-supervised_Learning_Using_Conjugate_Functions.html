<p>Author: Gideon S. Mann, Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an overview of generalized expectation criteria (GE), a simple, robust, scalable method for semi-supervised training using weakly-labeled data. GE ﬁts model parameters by favoring models that match certain expectation constraints, such as marginal label distributions, on the unlabeled data. This paper shows how to apply generalized expectation criteria to two classes of parametric models: maximum entropy models and conditional random ﬁelds. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements over supervised training and a number of other stateof-the-art semi-supervised learning methods for these models.

<p>Author: Gilles Blanchard, Gyemin Lee, Clayton Scott</p><p>Abstract: A common setting for novelty detection assumes that labeled examples from the nominal class are available, but that labeled examples of novelties are unavailable. The standard (inductive) approach is to declare novelties where the nominal density is low, which reduces the problem to density level set estimation. In this paper, we consider the setting where an unlabeled and possibly contaminated sample is also available at learning time. We argue that novelty detection in this semi-supervised setting is naturally solved by a general reduction to a binary classiﬁcation problem. In particular, a detector with a desired false positive rate can be achieved through a reduction to Neyman-Pearson classiﬁcation. Unlike the inductive approach, semi-supervised novelty detection (SSND) yields detectors that are optimal (e.g., statistically consistent) regardless of the distribution on novelties. Therefore, in novelty detection, unlabeled data have a substantial impact on the theoretical properties of the decision rule. We validate the practical utility of SSND with an extensive experimental study. We also show that SSND provides distribution-free, learning-theoretic solutions to two well known problems in hypothesis testing. First, our results provide a general solution to the general two-sample problem, that is, the problem of determining whether two random samples arise from the same distribution. Second, a specialization of SSND coincides with the standard p-value approach to multiple testing under the so-called random effects model. Unlike standard rejection regions based on thresholded p-values, the general SSND framework allows for adaptation to arbitrary alternative distributions in multiple dimensions.

Our framework efﬁciently incorporates indirect supervision via constraints on posterior distributions of probabilistic models with latent variables. Posterior regularization separates model complexity from the complexity of structural constraints it is desired to satisfy. By directly imposing decomposable regularization on the posterior moments of latent variables during learning, we retain the computational efﬁciency of the unconstrained model while ensuring desired constraints hold in expectation. We present an efﬁcient algorithm for learning with posterior regularization and illustrate its versatility on a diverse set of structural constraints such as bijectivity, symmetry and group sparsity in several large scale experiments, including multi-view learning, cross-lingual dependency grammar induction, unsupervised part-of-speech induction, and bitext word alignment.1 Keywords: posterior regularization framework, unsupervised learning, latent variables models, prior knowledge, natural language processing</p><p>6 0.09161368 <a title="103-tfidf-6" href="./jmlr-2010-Rademacher_Complexities_and_Bounding_the_Excess_Risk_in_Active_Learning.html">95 jmlr-2010-Rademacher Complexities and Bounding the Excess Risk in Active Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Dotan Di Castro, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-Critic based approaches were among the ﬁrst to address reinforcement learning in a general setting. Recently, these algorithms have gained renewed interest due to their generality, good convergence properties, and possible biological relevance. In this paper, we introduce an online temporal difference based actor-critic algorithm which is proved to converge to a neighborhood of a local maximum of the average reward. Linear function approximation is used by the critic in order estimate the value function, and the temporal difference signal, which is passed from the critic to the actor. The main distinguishing feature of the present convergence proof is that both the actor and the critic operate on a similar time scale, while in most current convergence proofs they are required to have very different time scales in order to converge. Moreover, the same temporal difference signal is used to update the parameters of both the actor and the critic. A limitation of the proposed approach, compared to results available for two time scale convergence, is that convergence is guaranteed only to a neighborhood of an optimal value, rather to an optimal value itself. The single time scale and identical temporal difference signal used by the actor and the critic, may provide a step towards constructing more biologically realistic models of reinforcement learning in the brain.

<p>Author: Sumio Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2λ/n, where λ is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.

<p>Author: Shiliang Sun, John Shawe-Taylor</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general framework for sparse semi-supervised learning, which concerns using a small portion of unlabeled data and a few labeled data to represent target functions and thus has the merit of accelerating function evaluations when predicting the output of a new example. This framework makes use of Fenchel-Legendre conjugates to rewrite a convex insensitive loss involving a regularization with unlabeled data, and is applicable to a family of semi-supervised learning methods such as multi-view co-regularized least squares and single-view Laplacian support vector machines (SVMs). As an instantiation of this framework, we propose sparse multi-view SVMs which use a squared ε-insensitive loss. The resultant optimization is an inf-sup problem and the optimal solutions have arguably saddle-point properties. We present a globally optimal iterative algorithm to optimize the problem. We give the margin bound on the generalization error of the sparse multi-view SVMs, and derive the empirical Rademacher complexity for the induced function class. Experiments on artiﬁcial and real-world data show their effectiveness. We further give a sequential training approach to show their possibility and potential for uses in large-scale problems and provide encouraging experimental results indicating the efﬁcacy of the margin bound and empirical Rademacher complexity on characterizing the roles of unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning.

<p>Author: Peter Spirtes</p><p>Abstract: The goal of many sciences is to understand the mechanisms by which variables came to take on the values they have (that is, to ﬁnd a generative model), and to predict what the values of those variables would be if the naturally occurring mechanisms were subject to outside manipulations. The past 30 years has seen a number of conceptual developments that are partial solutions to the problem of causal inference from observational sample data or a mixture of observational sample and experimental data, particularly in the area of graphical causal modeling. However, in many domains, problems such as the large numbers of variables, small samples sizes, and possible presence of unmeasured causes, remain serious impediments to practical applications of these developments. The articles in the Special Topic on Causality address these and other problems in applying graphical causal modeling algorithms. This introduction to the Special Topic on Causality provides a brief introduction to graphical causal modeling, places the articles in a broader context, and describes the differences between causal inference and ordinary machine learning classiﬁcation and prediction problems.

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Varun Sharma, Uri Shalit, Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Learning a measure of similarity between pairs of objects is an important generic problem in machine learning. It is particularly useful in large scale applications like searching for an image that is similar to a given image or ﬁnding videos that are relevant to a given video. In these tasks, users look for objects that are not only visually similar but also semantically related to a given object. Unfortunately, the approaches that exist today for learning such semantic similarity do not scale to large data sets. This is both because typically their CPU and storage requirements grow quadratically with the sample size, and because many methods impose complex positivity constraints on the space of learned similarity functions. The current paper presents OASIS, an Online Algorithm for Scalable Image Similarity learning that learns a bilinear similarity measure over sparse representations. OASIS is an online dual approach using the passive-aggressive family of learning algorithms with a large margin criterion and an efﬁcient hinge loss cost. Our experiments show that OASIS is both fast and accurate at a wide range of scales: for a data set with thousands of images, it achieves better results than existing state-of-the-art methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. For large, web scale, data sets, OASIS can be trained on more than two million images from 150K text queries within 3 days on a single CPU. On this large scale data set, human evaluations showed that 35% of the ten nearest neighbors of a given test image, as found by OASIS, were semantically relevant to that image. This suggests that query independent similarity could be accurately learned even for large scale data sets that could not be handled before.

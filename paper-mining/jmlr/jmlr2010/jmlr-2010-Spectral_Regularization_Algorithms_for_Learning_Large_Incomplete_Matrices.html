Keshavan, Andrea Montanari, Sewoong Oh</p><p>Abstract: Given a matrix M of low-rank, we consider the problem of reconstructing it from noisy observations of a small, random subset of its entries. The problem arises in a variety of applications, from collaborative ﬁltering (the ‘Netﬂix problem’) to structure-from-motion and positioning.

<p>Author: Andreas Argyriou, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning a matrix W from a set of linear measurements. Our formulation consists in solving an optimization problem which involves regularization with a spectral penalty term. That is, the penalty term is a function of the spectrum of the covariance of W . Instances of this problem in machine learning include multi-task learning, collaborative ﬁltering and multi-view learning, among others. Our goal is to elucidate the form of the optimal solution of spectral learning. The theory of spectral learning relies on the von Neumann characterization of orthogonally invariant norms and their association with symmetric gauge functions. Using this tool we formulate a representer theorem for spectral regularization and specify it to several useful example, such as Schatten p−norms, trace norm and spectral norm, which should proved useful in applications.

<p>Author: Ming Yuan</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating a high dimensional inverse covariance matrix that can be well approximated by “sparse” matrices. Taking advantage of the connection between multivariate linear regression and entries of the inverse covariance matrix, we propose an estimating procedure that can effectively exploit such “sparsity”. The proposed method can be computed using linear programming and therefore has the potential to be used in very high dimensional problems. Oracle inequalities are established for the estimation error in terms of several operator norms, showing that the method is adaptive to different types of sparsity of the problem.

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider learning formulations with non-convex objective functions that often occur in practical applications. There are two approaches to this problem: • Heuristic methods such as gradient descent that only ﬁnd a local minimum. A drawback of this approach is the lack of theoretical guarantee showing that the local minimum gives a good solution. • Convex relaxation such as L1 -regularization that solves the problem under some conditions. However it often leads to a sub-optimal solution in reality. This paper tries to remedy the above gap between theory and practice. In particular, we present a multi-stage convex relaxation scheme for solving problems with non-convex objective functions. For learning formulations with sparse regularization, we analyze the behavior of a speciﬁc multistage relaxation scheme. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the local solution obtained by this procedure is superior to the global solution of the standard L1 convex relaxation for learning sparse targets.

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Guang Dai, Congfu Xu, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FDA) and its kernel extension—kernel discriminant analysis (KDA)—are well known methods that consider dimensionality reduction and classiﬁcation jointly. While widely deployed in practical problems, there are still unresolved issues surrounding their efﬁcient implementation and their relationship with least mean squares procedures. In this paper we address these issues within the framework of regularized estimation. Our approach leads to a ﬂexible and efﬁcient implementation of FDA as well as KDA. We also uncover a general relationship between regularized discriminant analysis and ridge regression. This relationship yields variations on conventional FDA based on the pseudoinverse and a direct equivalence to an ordinary least squares estimator.

<p>Author: Alexander Ilin, Tapani Raiko</p><p>Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a classical data analysis technique that Ä?Ĺš nds linear transformations of data that retain the maximal amount of variance. We study a case where some of the data values are missing, and show that this problem has many features which are usually associated with nonlinear models, such as overÄ?Ĺš tting and bad locally optimal solutions. A probabilistic formulation of PCA provides a good foundation for handling missing values, and we provide formulas for doing that. In case of high dimensional and very sparse data, overÄ?Ĺš tting becomes a severe problem and traditional algorithms for PCA are very slow. We introduce a novel fast algorithm and extend it to variational Bayesian learning. Different versions of PCA are compared in artiÄ?Ĺš cial experiments, demonstrating the effects of regularization and modeling of posterior variance. The scalability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to the NetÄ?Ĺš&sbquo;ix problem.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Vicenç Gómez, Hilbert J. Kappen, Michael Chertkov</p><p>Abstract: We introduce novel results for approximate inference on planar graphical models using the loop calculus framework. The loop calculus (Chertkov and Chernyak, 2006a) allows to express the exact partition function of a graphical model as a ﬁnite sum of terms that can be evaluated once the belief propagation (BP) solution is known. In general, full summation over all correction terms is intractable. We develop an algorithm for the approach presented in Chertkov et al. (2008) which represents an efﬁcient truncation scheme on planar graphs and a new representation of the series in terms of Pfafﬁans of matrices. We analyze the performance of the algorithm for models with binary variables and pairwise interactions on grids and other planar graphs. We study in detail both the loop series and the equivalent Pfafﬁan series and show that the ﬁrst term of the Pfafﬁan series for the general, intractable planar model, can provide very accurate approximations. The algorithm outperforms previous truncation schemes of the loop series and is competitive with other state of the art methods for approximate inference.

<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev, João Graça, Jennifer Gillenwater, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We present posterior regularization, a probabilistic framework for structured, weakly supervised learning. Our framework efﬁciently incorporates indirect supervision via constraints on posterior distributions of probabilistic models with latent variables. Posterior regularization separates model complexity from the complexity of structural constraints it is desired to satisfy. By directly imposing decomposable regularization on the posterior moments of latent variables during learning, we retain the computational efﬁciency of the unconstrained model while ensuring desired constraints hold in expectation. We present an efﬁcient algorithm for learning with posterior regularization and illustrate its versatility on a diverse set of structural constraints such as bijectivity, symmetry and group sparsity in several large scale experiments, including multi-view learning, cross-lingual dependency grammar induction, unsupervised part-of-speech induction, and bitext word alignment.1 Keywords: posterior regularization framework, unsupervised learning, latent variables models, prior knowledge, natural language processing</p><p>5 0.48898613 <a title="105-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2010-Learning_Translation_Invariant_Kernels_for_Classification.html">65 jmlr-2010-Learning Translation Invariant Kernels for Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamaledin Ghiasi-Shirazi, Reza Safabakhsh, Mostafa Shamsi</p><p>Abstract: Appropriate selection of the kernel function, which implicitly deﬁnes the feature space of an algorithm, has a crucial role in the success of kernel methods. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing a kernel function over the class of translation invariant kernels for the task of binary classiﬁcation. The learning capacity of this class is invariant with respect to rotation and scaling of the features and it encompasses the set of radial kernels. We show that how translation invariant kernel functions can be embedded in a nested set of sub-classes and consider the kernel learning problem over one of these sub-classes. This allows the choice of an appropriate sub-class based on the problem at hand. We use the criterion proposed by Lanckriet et al. (2004) to obtain a functional formulation for the problem. It will be proven that the optimal kernel is a ﬁnite mixture of cosine functions. The kernel learning problem is then formulated as a semi-inﬁnite programming (SIP) problem which is solved by a sequence of quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) sub-problems. Using the fact that the cosine kernel is of rank two, we propose a formulation of a QCQP sub-problem which does not require the kernel matrices to be loaded into memory, making the method applicable to large-scale problems. We also address the issue of including other classes of kernels, such as individual kernels and isotropic Gaussian kernels, in the learning process. Another interesting feature of the proposed method is that the optimal classiﬁer has an expansion in terms of the number of cosine kernels, instead of support vectors, leading to a remarkable speedup at run-time. As a by-product, we also generalize the kernel trick to complex-valued kernel functions. Our experiments on artiﬁcial and real-world benchmark data sets, including the USPS and the MNIST digit recognition data sets, show the usefulness of the proposed method.

<p>Author: Jean-Yves Audibert, Sébastien Bubeck</p><p>Abstract: This work deals with four classical prediction settings, namely full information, bandit, label efﬁcient and bandit label efﬁcient as well as four different notions of regret: pseudo-regret, expected regret, high probability regret and tracking the best expert regret. We introduce a new forecaster, INF (Implicitly Normalized Forecaster) based on an arbitrary function ψ for which we propose a uniﬁed γ analysis of its pseudo-regret in the four games we consider. In particular, for ψ(x) = exp(ηx) + K , INF reduces to the classical exponentially weighted average forecaster and our analysis of the pseudo-regret recovers known results while for the expected regret we slightly tighten the bounds. γ η q On the other hand with ψ(x) = −x + K , which deﬁnes a new forecaster, we are able to remove the extraneous logarithmic factor in the pseudo-regret bounds for bandits games, and thus ﬁll in a long open gap in the characterization of the minimax rate for the pseudo-regret in the bandit game. We also provide high probability bounds depending on the cumulative reward of the optimal action. Finally, we consider the stochastic bandit game, and prove that an appropriate modiﬁcation of the upper conﬁdence bound policy UCB1 (Auer et al., 2002a) achieves the distribution-free optimal rate while still having a distribution-dependent rate logarithmic in the number of plays.

<p>Author: András György, Gábor Lugosi, György Ottucsàk</p><p>Abstract: We consider a sequential version of the classical bin packing problem in which items are received one by one. Before the size of the next item is revealed, the decision maker needs to decide whether the next item is packed in the currently open bin or the bin is closed and a new bin is opened. If the new item does not ﬁt, it is lost. If a bin is closed, the remaining free space in the bin accounts for a loss. The goal of the decision maker is to minimize the loss accumulated over n periods. We present an algorithm that has a cumulative loss not much larger than any strategy in a ﬁnite class of reference strategies for any sequence of items. Special attention is payed to reference strategies that use a ﬁxed threshold at each step to decide whether a new bin is opened. Some positive and negative results are presented for this case.

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider learning formulations with non-convex objective functions that often occur in practical applications. There are two approaches to this problem: • Heuristic methods such as gradient descent that only ﬁnd a local minimum. A drawback of this approach is the lack of theoretical guarantee showing that the local minimum gives a good solution. • Convex relaxation such as L1 -regularization that solves the problem under some conditions. However it often leads to a sub-optimal solution in reality. This paper tries to remedy the above gap between theory and practice. In particular, we present a multi-stage convex relaxation scheme for solving problems with non-convex objective functions. For learning formulations with sparse regularization, we analyze the behavior of a speciﬁc multistage relaxation scheme. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the local solution obtained by this procedure is superior to the global solution of the standard L1 convex relaxation for learning sparse targets.

<p>Author: Dotan Di Castro, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-Critic based approaches were among the ﬁrst to address reinforcement learning in a general setting. Recently, these algorithms have gained renewed interest due to their generality, good convergence properties, and possible biological relevance. In this paper, we introduce an online temporal difference based actor-critic algorithm which is proved to converge to a neighborhood of a local maximum of the average reward. Linear function approximation is used by the critic in order estimate the value function, and the temporal difference signal, which is passed from the critic to the actor. The main distinguishing feature of the present convergence proof is that both the actor and the critic operate on a similar time scale, while in most current convergence proofs they are required to have very different time scales in order to converge. Moreover, the same temporal difference signal is used to update the parameters of both the actor and the critic. A limitation of the proposed approach, compared to results available for two time scale convergence, is that convergence is guaranteed only to a neighborhood of an optimal value, rather to an optimal value itself. The single time scale and identical temporal difference signal used by the actor and the critic, may provide a step towards constructing more biologically realistic models of reinforcement learning in the brain.

<p>Author: Phillip Verbancsics, Kenneth O. Stanley</p><p>Abstract: An important goal for machine learning is to transfer knowledge between tasks. For example, learning to play RoboCup Keepaway should contribute to learning the full game of RoboCup soccer. Previous approaches to transfer in Keepaway have focused on transforming the original representation to ﬁt the new task. In contrast, this paper explores the idea that transfer is most effective if the representation is designed to be the same even across different tasks. To demonstrate this point, a bird’s eye view (BEV) representation is introduced that can represent different tasks on the same two-dimensional map. For example, both the 3 vs. 2 and 4 vs. 3 Keepaway tasks can be represented on the same BEV. Yet the problem is that a raw two-dimensional map is high-dimensional and unstructured. This paper shows how this problem is addressed naturally by an idea from evolutionary computation called indirect encoding, which compresses the representation by exploiting its geometry. The result is that the BEV learns a Keepaway policy that transfers without further learning or manipulation. It also facilitates transferring knowledge learned in a different domain, Knight Joust, into Keepaway. Finally, the indirect encoding of the BEV means that its geometry can be changed without altering the solution. Thus static representations facilitate several kinds of transfer.</p><p>6 0.34065554 <a title="79-lsi-6" href="./jmlr-2010-Analysis_of_Multi-stage_Convex_Relaxation_for_Sparse_Regularization.html">12 jmlr-2010-Analysis of Multi-stage Convex Relaxation for Sparse Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Jaksch, Ronald Ortner, Peter Auer</p><p>Abstract: For undiscounted reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs) we consider the total regret of a learning algorithm with respect to an optimal policy. In order to describe the transition structure of an MDP we propose a new parameter: An MDP has diameter D if for any pair of states s, s′ there is a policy which moves from s to s′ in at most D steps (on average). √ ˜ We present a reinforcement learning algorithm with total regret O(DS AT ) after T steps for any unknown MDP with S states, A actions per state, and diameter D. A corresponding lower bound of √ Ω( DSAT ) on the total regret of any learning algorithm is given as well. These results are complemented by a sample complexity bound on the number of suboptimal steps taken by our algorithm. This bound can be used to achieve a (gap-dependent) regret bound that is logarithmic in T . Finally, we also consider a setting where the MDP is allowed to change a ﬁxed number of ℓ times. We present a modiﬁcation of our algorithm that is able to deal with this setting and show a √ ˜ regret bound of O(ℓ1/3 T 2/3 DS A).

<p>Author: Sumio Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2λ/n, where λ is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Varun Sharma, Uri Shalit, Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Learning a measure of similarity between pairs of objects is an important generic problem in machine learning. It is particularly useful in large scale applications like searching for an image that is similar to a given image or ﬁnding videos that are relevant to a given video. In these tasks, users look for objects that are not only visually similar but also semantically related to a given object. Unfortunately, the approaches that exist today for learning such semantic similarity do not scale to large data sets. This is both because typically their CPU and storage requirements grow quadratically with the sample size, and because many methods impose complex positivity constraints on the space of learned similarity functions. The current paper presents OASIS, an Online Algorithm for Scalable Image Similarity learning that learns a bilinear similarity measure over sparse representations. OASIS is an online dual approach using the passive-aggressive family of learning algorithms with a large margin criterion and an efﬁcient hinge loss cost. Our experiments show that OASIS is both fast and accurate at a wide range of scales: for a data set with thousands of images, it achieves better results than existing state-of-the-art methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. For large, web scale, data sets, OASIS can be trained on more than two million images from 150K text queries within 3 days on a single CPU. On this large scale data set, human evaluations showed that 35% of the ten nearest neighbors of a given test image, as found by OASIS, were semantically relevant to that image. This suggests that query independent similarity could be accurately learned even for large scale data sets that could not be handled before.

<p>Author: Dotan Di Castro, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-Critic based approaches were among the ﬁrst to address reinforcement learning in a general setting. Recently, these algorithms have gained renewed interest due to their generality, good convergence properties, and possible biological relevance. In this paper, we introduce an online temporal difference based actor-critic algorithm which is proved to converge to a neighborhood of a local maximum of the average reward. Linear function approximation is used by the critic in order estimate the value function, and the temporal difference signal, which is passed from the critic to the actor. The main distinguishing feature of the present convergence proof is that both the actor and the critic operate on a similar time scale, while in most current convergence proofs they are required to have very different time scales in order to converge. Moreover, the same temporal difference signal is used to update the parameters of both the actor and the critic. A limitation of the proposed approach, compared to results available for two time scale convergence, is that convergence is guaranteed only to a neighborhood of an optimal value, rather to an optimal value itself. The single time scale and identical temporal difference signal used by the actor and the critic, may provide a step towards constructing more biologically realistic models of reinforcement learning in the brain.

<p>Author: Shiliang Sun, John Shawe-Taylor</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general framework for sparse semi-supervised learning, which concerns using a small portion of unlabeled data and a few labeled data to represent target functions and thus has the merit of accelerating function evaluations when predicting the output of a new example. This framework makes use of Fenchel-Legendre conjugates to rewrite a convex insensitive loss involving a regularization with unlabeled data, and is applicable to a family of semi-supervised learning methods such as multi-view co-regularized least squares and single-view Laplacian support vector machines (SVMs). As an instantiation of this framework, we propose sparse multi-view SVMs which use a squared ε-insensitive loss. The resultant optimization is an inf-sup problem and the optimal solutions have arguably saddle-point properties. We present a globally optimal iterative algorithm to optimize the problem. We give the margin bound on the generalization error of the sparse multi-view SVMs, and derive the empirical Rademacher complexity for the induced function class. Experiments on artiﬁcial and real-world data show their effectiveness. We further give a sequential training approach to show their possibility and potential for uses in large-scale problems and provide encouraging experimental results indicating the efﬁcacy of the margin bound and empirical Rademacher complexity on characterizing the roles of unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning.

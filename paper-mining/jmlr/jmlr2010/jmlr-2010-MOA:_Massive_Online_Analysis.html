<p>Author: Dapo Omidiran, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of high-dimensional variable selection: given n noisy observations of a k-sparse vector β∗ ∈ R p , estimate the subset of non-zero entries of β∗ . A signiﬁcant body of work has studied behavior of ℓ1 -relaxations when applied to random measurement matrices that are dense (e.g., Gaussian, Bernoulli). In this paper, we analyze sparsiﬁed measurement ensembles, and consider the trade-off between measurement sparsity, as measured by the fraction γ of nonzero entries, and the statistical efﬁciency, as measured by the minimal number of observations n required for correct variable selection with probability converging to one. Our main result is to prove that it is possible to let the fraction on non-zero entries γ → 0 at some rate, yielding measurement matrices with a vanishing fraction of non-zeros per row, while retaining the same statistical efﬁciency as dense ensembles. A variety of simulation results conﬁrm the sharpness of our theoretical predictions.

<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Francis Bach, Jean Ponce, Guillermo Sapiro</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding—that is, modelling data vectors as sparse linear combinations of basis elements—is widely used in machine learning, neuroscience, signal processing, and statistics. This paper focuses on the large-scale matrix factorization problem that consists of learning the basis set in order to adapt it to speciﬁc data. Variations of this problem include dictionary learning in signal processing, non-negative matrix factorization and sparse principal component analysis. In this paper, we propose to address these tasks with a new online optimization algorithm, based on stochastic approximations, which scales up gracefully to large data sets with millions of training samples, and extends naturally to various matrix factorization formulations, making it suitable for a wide range of learning problems. A proof of convergence is presented, along with experiments with natural images and genomic data demonstrating that it leads to state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed and optimization for both small and large data sets.

<p>Author: Yael Ben-Haim, Elad Tom-Tov</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for building decision tree classiﬁers. The algorithm is executed in a distributed environment and is especially designed for classifying large data sets and streaming data. It is empirically shown to be as accurate as a standard decision tree classiﬁer, while being scalable for processing of streaming data on multiple processors. These ﬁndings are supported by a rigorous analysis of the algorithm’s accuracy. The essence of the algorithm is to quickly construct histograms at the processors, which compress the data to a ﬁxed amount of memory. A master processor uses this information to ﬁnd near-optimal split points to terminal tree nodes. Our analysis shows that guarantees on the local accuracy of split points imply guarantees on the overall tree accuracy.

<p>Author: Isabelle Guyon, Amir Saffari, Gideon Dror, Gavin Cawley</p><p>Abstract: The principle of parsimony also known as “Ockham’s razor” has inspired many theories of model selection. Yet such theories, all making arguments in favor of parsimony, are based on very different premises and have developed distinct methodologies to derive algorithms. We have organized challenges and edited a special issue of JMLR and several conference proceedings around the theme of model selection. In this editorial, we revisit the problem of avoiding overﬁtting in light of the latest results. We note the remarkable convergence of theories as different as Bayesian theory, Minimum Description Length, bias/variance tradeoff, Structural Risk Minimization, and regularization, in some approaches. We also present new and interesting examples of the complementarity of theories leading to hybrid algorithms, neither frequentist, nor Bayesian, or perhaps both frequentist and Bayesian!

<p>Author: Fu Chang, Chien-Yang Guo, Xiao-Rong Lin, Chi-Jen Lu</p><p>Abstract: To handle problems created by large data sets, we propose a method that uses a decision tree to decompose a given data space and train SVMs on the decomposed regions. Although there are other means of decomposing a data space, we show that the decision tree has several merits for large-scale SVM training. First, it can classify some data points by its own means, thereby reducing the cost of SVM training for the remaining data points. Second, it is efﬁcient in determining the parameter values that maximize the validation accuracy, which helps maintain good test accuracy. Third, the tree decomposition method can derive a generalization error bound for the classiﬁer. For data sets whose size can be handled by current non-linear, or kernel-based, SVM training techniques, the proposed method can speed up the training by a factor of thousands, and still achieve comparable test accuracy.

<p>Author: Pedro A. Forero, Alfonso Cano, Georgios B. Giannakis</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops algorithms to train support vector machines when training data are distributed across different nodes, and their communication to a centralized processing unit is prohibited due to, for example, communication complexity, scalability, or privacy reasons. To accomplish this goal, the centralized linear SVM problem is cast as a set of decentralized convex optimization subproblems (one per node) with consensus constraints on the wanted classiﬁer parameters. Using the alternating direction method of multipliers, fully distributed training algorithms are obtained without exchanging training data among nodes. Different from existing incremental approaches, the overhead associated with inter-node communications is ﬁxed and solely dependent on the network topology rather than the size of the training sets available per node. Important generalizations to train nonlinear SVMs in a distributed fashion are also developed along with sequential variants capable of online processing. Simulated tests illustrate the performance of the novel algorithms.1 Keywords: support vector machine, distributed optimization, distributed data mining, distributed learning, sensor networks</p><p>4 0.25568381 <a title="70-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2010-Model_Selection%3A_Beyond_the_Bayesian_Frequentist_Divide.html">78 jmlr-2010-Model Selection: Beyond the Bayesian Frequentist Divide</a></p>

We have organized challenges and edited a special issue of JMLR and several conference proceedings around the theme of model selection. In this editorial, we revisit the problem of avoiding overﬁtting in light of the latest results. We note the remarkable convergence of theories as different as Bayesian theory, Minimum Description Length, bias/variance tradeoff, Structural Risk Minimization, and regularization, in some approaches. We also present new and interesting examples of the complementarity of theories leading to hybrid algorithms, neither frequentist, nor Bayesian, or perhaps both frequentist and Bayesian! Keywords: model selection, ensemble methods, multilevel inference, multilevel optimization, performance prediction, bias-variance tradeoff, Bayesian priors, structural risk minimization, guaranteed risk minimization, over-ﬁtting, regularization, minimum description length</p><p>5 0.25377569 <a title="70-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2010-An_Exponential_Model_for_Infinite_Rankings.html">10 jmlr-2010-An Exponential Model for Infinite Rankings</a></p>
<p>Author: Marina Meilă, Le Bao</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a statistical model for expressing preferences through rankings, when the number of alternatives (items to rank) is large. A human ranker will then typically rank only the most preferred items, and may not even examine the whole set of items, or know how many they are. Similarly, a user presented with the ranked output of a search engine, will only consider the highest ranked items. We model such situations by introducing a stagewise ranking model that operates with ﬁnite ordered lists called top-t orderings over an inﬁnite space of items. We give algorithms to estimate this model from data, and demonstrate that it has sufﬁcient statistics, being thus an exponential family model with continuous and discrete parameters. We describe its conjugate prior and other statistical properties. Then, we extend the estimation problem to multimodal data by introducing an Exponential-Blurring-Mean-Shift nonparametric clustering algorithm. The experiments highlight the properties of our model and demonstrate that inﬁnite models over permutations can be simple, elegant and practical.

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider learning formulations with non-convex objective functions that often occur in practical applications. There are two approaches to this problem: • Heuristic methods such as gradient descent that only ﬁnd a local minimum. A drawback of this approach is the lack of theoretical guarantee showing that the local minimum gives a good solution. • Convex relaxation such as L1 -regularization that solves the problem under some conditions. However it often leads to a sub-optimal solution in reality. This paper tries to remedy the above gap between theory and practice. In particular, we present a multi-stage convex relaxation scheme for solving problems with non-convex objective functions. For learning formulations with sparse regularization, we analyze the behavior of a speciﬁc multistage relaxation scheme. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the local solution obtained by this procedure is superior to the global solution of the standard L1 convex relaxation for learning sparse targets.

<p>Author: Dapo Omidiran, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of high-dimensional variable selection: given n noisy observations of a k-sparse vector β∗ ∈ R p , estimate the subset of non-zero entries of β∗ . A signiﬁcant body of work has studied behavior of ℓ1 -relaxations when applied to random measurement matrices that are dense (e.g., Gaussian, Bernoulli). In this paper, we analyze sparsiﬁed measurement ensembles, and consider the trade-off between measurement sparsity, as measured by the fraction γ of nonzero entries, and the statistical efﬁciency, as measured by the minimal number of observations n required for correct variable selection with probability converging to one. Our main result is to prove that it is possible to let the fraction on non-zero entries γ → 0 at some rate, yielding measurement matrices with a vanishing fraction of non-zeros per row, while retaining the same statistical efﬁciency as dense ensembles. A variety of simulation results conﬁrm the sharpness of our theoretical predictions.

<p>Author: Jitkomut Songsiri, Lieven Vandenberghe</p><p>Abstract: An algorithm is presented for topology selection in graphical models of autoregressive Gaussian time series. The graph topology of the model represents the sparsity pattern of the inverse spectrum of the time series and characterizes conditional independence relations between the variables. The method proposed in the paper is based on an ℓ1 -type nonsmooth regularization of the conditional maximum likelihood estimation problem. We show that this reduces to a convex optimization problem and describe a large-scale algorithm that solves the dual problem via the gradient projection method. Results of experiments with randomly generated and real data sets are also included.

<p>Author: Fabian Sinz, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new family of probability densities called L p -nested symmetric distributions. The common property, shared by all members of the new class, is the same functional form ˜ x x ρ(x ) = ρ( f (x )), where f is a nested cascade of L p -norms x p = (∑ |xi | p )1/p . L p -nested symmetric distributions thereby are a special case of ν-spherical distributions for which f is only required to be positively homogeneous of degree one. While both, ν-spherical and L p -nested symmetric distributions, contain many widely used families of probability models such as the Gaussian, spherically and elliptically symmetric distributions, L p -spherically symmetric distributions, and certain types of independent component analysis (ICA) and independent subspace analysis (ISA) models, ν-spherical distributions are usually computationally intractable. Here we demonstrate that L p nested symmetric distributions are still computationally feasible by deriving an analytic expression for its normalization constant, gradients for maximum likelihood estimation, analytic expressions for certain types of marginals, as well as an exact and efﬁcient sampling algorithm. We discuss the tight links of L p -nested symmetric distributions to well known machine learning methods such as ICA, ISA and mixed norm regularizers, and introduce the nested radial factorization algorithm (NRF), which is a form of non-linear ICA that transforms any linearly mixed, non-factorial L p nested symmetric source into statistically independent signals. As a corollary, we also introduce the uniform distribution on the L p -nested unit sphere.

<p>Author: Christoforos Christoforou, Robert Haralick, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: Traditional analysis methods for single-trial classiﬁcation of electro-encephalography (EEG) focus on two types of paradigms: phase-locked methods, in which the amplitude of the signal is used as the feature for classiﬁcation, that is, event related potentials; and second-order methods, in which the feature of interest is the power of the signal, that is, event related (de)synchronization. The process of deciding which paradigm to use is ad hoc and is driven by assumptions regarding the underlying neural generators. Here we propose a method that provides an uniﬁed framework for the analysis of EEG, combining ﬁrst and second-order spatial and temporal features based on a bilinear model. Evaluation of the proposed method on simulated data shows that the technique outperforms state-of-the art techniques for single-trial classiﬁcation for a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios. Evaluations on human EEG—including one benchmark data set from the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) competition—show statistically signiﬁcant gains in classiﬁcation accuracy, with a reduction in overall classiﬁcation error from 26%-28% to 19%.

<p>Author: Guo-Xun Yuan, Kai-Wei Chang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Large-scale linear classiﬁcation is widely used in many areas. The L1-regularized form can be applied for feature selection; however, its non-differentiability causes more difﬁculties in training. Although various optimization methods have been proposed in recent years, these have not yet been compared suitably. In this paper, we ﬁrst broadly review existing methods. Then, we discuss state-of-the-art software packages in detail and propose two efﬁcient implementations. Extensive comparisons indicate that carefully implemented coordinate descent methods are very suitable for training large document data.

<p>Author: Jianing Shi, Wotao Yin, Stanley Osher, Paul Sajda</p><p>Abstract: ℓ1 -regularized logistic regression, also known as sparse logistic regression, is widely used in machine learning, computer vision, data mining, bioinformatics and neural signal processing. The use of ℓ1 regularization attributes attractive properties to the classiﬁer, such as feature selection, robustness to noise, and as a result, classiﬁer generality in the context of supervised learning. When a sparse logistic regression problem has large-scale data in high dimensions, it is computationally expensive to minimize the non-differentiable ℓ1 -norm in the objective function. Motivated by recent work (Koh et al., 2007; Hale et al., 2008), we propose a novel hybrid algorithm based on combining two types of optimization iterations: one being very fast and memory friendly while the other being slower but more accurate. Called hybrid iterative shrinkage (HIS), the resulting algorithm is comprised of a ﬁxed point continuation phase and an interior point phase. The ﬁrst phase is based completely on memory efﬁcient operations such as matrix-vector multiplications, while the second phase is based on a truncated Newton’s method. Furthermore, we show that various optimization techniques, including line search and continuation, can signiﬁcantly accelerate convergence. The algorithm has global convergence at a geometric rate (a Q-linear rate in optimization terminology). We present a numerical comparison with several existing algorithms, including an analysis using benchmark data from the UCI machine learning repository, and show our algorithm is the most computationally efﬁcient without loss of accuracy.

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider learning formulations with non-convex objective functions that often occur in practical applications. There are two approaches to this problem: • Heuristic methods such as gradient descent that only ﬁnd a local minimum. A drawback of this approach is the lack of theoretical guarantee showing that the local minimum gives a good solution. • Convex relaxation such as L1 -regularization that solves the problem under some conditions. However it often leads to a sub-optimal solution in reality. This paper tries to remedy the above gap between theory and practice. In particular, we present a multi-stage convex relaxation scheme for solving problems with non-convex objective functions. For learning formulations with sparse regularization, we analyze the behavior of a speciﬁc multistage relaxation scheme. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the local solution obtained by this procedure is superior to the global solution of the standard L1 convex relaxation for learning sparse targets.

<p>Author: Ming Yuan, Marten Wegkamp</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of binary classiﬁcation with a reject option in which one can withhold the decision of classifying an observation at a cost lower than that of misclassiﬁcation. Since the natural loss function is non-convex so that empirical risk minimization easily becomes infeasible, the paper proposes minimizing convex risks based on surrogate convex loss functions. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for inﬁnite sample consistency (both risks share the same minimizer) is provided. Moreover, we show that the excess risk can be bounded through the excess surrogate risk under appropriate conditions. These bounds can be tightened by a generalized margin condition. The impact of the results is illustrated on several commonly used surrogate loss functions.

<p>Author: Dapo Omidiran, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of high-dimensional variable selection: given n noisy observations of a k-sparse vector β∗ ∈ R p , estimate the subset of non-zero entries of β∗ . A signiﬁcant body of work has studied behavior of ℓ1 -relaxations when applied to random measurement matrices that are dense (e.g., Gaussian, Bernoulli). In this paper, we analyze sparsiﬁed measurement ensembles, and consider the trade-off between measurement sparsity, as measured by the fraction γ of nonzero entries, and the statistical efﬁciency, as measured by the minimal number of observations n required for correct variable selection with probability converging to one. Our main result is to prove that it is possible to let the fraction on non-zero entries γ → 0 at some rate, yielding measurement matrices with a vanishing fraction of non-zeros per row, while retaining the same statistical efﬁciency as dense ensembles. A variety of simulation results conﬁrm the sharpness of our theoretical predictions.

<p>Author: Fei Ye, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider the estimation of regression coefﬁcients in a high-dimensional linear model. For regression coefﬁcients in ℓr balls, we provide lower bounds for the minimax ℓq risk and minimax quantiles of the ℓq loss for all design matrices. Under an ℓ0 sparsity condition on a target coefﬁcient vector, we sharpen and unify existing oracle inequalities for the Lasso and Dantzig selector. We derive oracle inequalities for target coefﬁcient vectors with many small elements and smaller threshold levels than the universal threshold. These oracle inequalities provide sufﬁcient conditions on the design matrix for the rate minimaxity of the Lasso and Dantzig selector for the ℓq risk and loss in ℓr balls, 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 ≤ q ≤ ∞. By allowing q = ∞, our risk bounds imply the variable selection consistency of threshold Lasso and Dantzig selectors.

<p>Author: Pradeep Ravikumar, Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: The problem of computing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) conﬁguration is a central computational challenge associated with Markov random ﬁelds. There has been some focus on “tree-based” linear programming (LP) relaxations for the MAP problem. This paper develops a family of super-linearly convergent algorithms for solving these LPs, based on proximal minimization schemes using Bregman divergences. As with standard message-passing on graphs, the algorithms are distributed and exploit the underlying graphical structure, and so scale well to large problems. Our algorithms have a double-loop character, with the outer loop corresponding to the proximal sequence, and an inner loop of cyclic Bregman projections used to compute each proximal update. We establish convergence guarantees for our algorithms, and illustrate their performance via some simulations. We also develop two classes of rounding schemes, deterministic and randomized, for obtaining integral conﬁgurations from the LP solutions. Our deterministic rounding schemes use a “re-parameterization” property of our algorithms so that when the LP solution is integral, the MAP solution can be obtained even before the LP-solver converges to the optimum. We also propose graph-structured randomized rounding schemes applicable to iterative LP-solving algorithms in general. We analyze the performance of and report simulations comparing these rounding schemes.

<p>Author: Marina Meilă, Le Bao</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a statistical model for expressing preferences through rankings, when the number of alternatives (items to rank) is large. A human ranker will then typically rank only the most preferred items, and may not even examine the whole set of items, or know how many they are. Similarly, a user presented with the ranked output of a search engine, will only consider the highest ranked items. We model such situations by introducing a stagewise ranking model that operates with ﬁnite ordered lists called top-t orderings over an inﬁnite space of items. We give algorithms to estimate this model from data, and demonstrate that it has sufﬁcient statistics, being thus an exponential family model with continuous and discrete parameters. We describe its conjugate prior and other statistical properties. Then, we extend the estimation problem to multimodal data by introducing an Exponential-Blurring-Mean-Shift nonparametric clustering algorithm. The experiments highlight the properties of our model and demonstrate that inﬁnite models over permutations can be simple, elegant and practical.

<p>Author: Thomas Jaksch, Ronald Ortner, Peter Auer</p><p>Abstract: For undiscounted reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs) we consider the total regret of a learning algorithm with respect to an optimal policy. In order to describe the transition structure of an MDP we propose a new parameter: An MDP has diameter D if for any pair of states s, s′ there is a policy which moves from s to s′ in at most D steps (on average). √ ˜ We present a reinforcement learning algorithm with total regret O(DS AT ) after T steps for any unknown MDP with S states, A actions per state, and diameter D. A corresponding lower bound of √ Ω( DSAT ) on the total regret of any learning algorithm is given as well. These results are complemented by a sample complexity bound on the number of suboptimal steps taken by our algorithm. This bound can be used to achieve a (gap-dependent) regret bound that is logarithmic in T . Finally, we also consider a setting where the MDP is allowed to change a ﬁxed number of ℓ times. We present a modiﬁcation of our algorithm that is able to deal with this setting and show a √ ˜ regret bound of O(ℓ1/3 T 2/3 DS A).

<p>Author: Jean-Yves Audibert, Sébastien Bubeck</p><p>Abstract: This work deals with four classical prediction settings, namely full information, bandit, label efﬁcient and bandit label efﬁcient as well as four different notions of regret: pseudo-regret, expected regret, high probability regret and tracking the best expert regret. We introduce a new forecaster, INF (Implicitly Normalized Forecaster) based on an arbitrary function ψ for which we propose a uniﬁed γ analysis of its pseudo-regret in the four games we consider. In particular, for ψ(x) = exp(ηx) + K , INF reduces to the classical exponentially weighted average forecaster and our analysis of the pseudo-regret recovers known results while for the expected regret we slightly tighten the bounds. γ η q On the other hand with ψ(x) = −x + K , which deﬁnes a new forecaster, we are able to remove the extraneous logarithmic factor in the pseudo-regret bounds for bandits games, and thus ﬁll in a long open gap in the characterization of the minimax rate for the pseudo-regret in the bandit game. We also provide high probability bounds depending on the cumulative reward of the optimal action. Finally, we consider the stochastic bandit game, and prove that an appropriate modiﬁcation of the upper conﬁdence bound policy UCB1 (Auer et al., 2002a) achieves the distribution-free optimal rate while still having a distribution-dependent rate logarithmic in the number of plays. Keywords: Bandits (adversarial and stochastic), regret bound, minimax rate, label efﬁcient, upper conﬁdence bound (UCB) policy, online learning, prediction with limited feedback.</p><p>6 0.069007903 <a title="80-tfidf-6" href="./jmlr-2010-Composite_Binary_Losses.html">25 jmlr-2010-Composite Binary Losses</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Guang Dai, Congfu Xu, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FDA) and its kernel extension—kernel discriminant analysis (KDA)—are well known methods that consider dimensionality reduction and classiﬁcation jointly. While widely deployed in practical problems, there are still unresolved issues surrounding their efﬁcient implementation and their relationship with least mean squares procedures. In this paper we address these issues within the framework of regularized estimation. Our approach leads to a ﬂexible and efﬁcient implementation of FDA as well as KDA. We also uncover a general relationship between regularized discriminant analysis and ridge regression. This relationship yields variations on conventional FDA based on the pseudoinverse and a direct equivalence to an ordinary least squares estimator.

<p>Author: Pradeep Ravikumar, Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: The problem of computing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) conﬁguration is a central computational challenge associated with Markov random ﬁelds. There has been some focus on “tree-based” linear programming (LP) relaxations for the MAP problem. This paper develops a family of super-linearly convergent algorithms for solving these LPs, based on proximal minimization schemes using Bregman divergences. As with standard message-passing on graphs, the algorithms are distributed and exploit the underlying graphical structure, and so scale well to large problems. Our algorithms have a double-loop character, with the outer loop corresponding to the proximal sequence, and an inner loop of cyclic Bregman projections used to compute each proximal update. We establish convergence guarantees for our algorithms, and illustrate their performance via some simulations. We also develop two classes of rounding schemes, deterministic and randomized, for obtaining integral conﬁgurations from the LP solutions. Our deterministic rounding schemes use a “re-parameterization” property of our algorithms so that when the LP solution is integral, the MAP solution can be obtained even before the LP-solver converges to the optimum. We also propose graph-structured randomized rounding schemes applicable to iterative LP-solving algorithms in general. We analyze the performance of and report simulations comparing these rounding schemes.

<p>Author: Kush R. Varshney, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: A variational level set method is developed for the supervised classiﬁcation problem. Nonlinear classiﬁer decision boundaries are obtained by minimizing an energy functional that is composed of an empirical risk term with a margin-based loss and a geometric regularization term new to machine learning: the surface area of the decision boundary. This geometric level set classiﬁer is analyzed in terms of consistency and complexity through the calculation of its ε-entropy. For multicategory classiﬁcation, an efﬁcient scheme is developed using a logarithmic number of decision functions in the number of classes rather than the typical linear number of decision functions. Geometric level set classiﬁcation yields performance results on benchmark data sets that are competitive with well-established methods.

<p>Author: Yael Ben-Haim, Elad Tom-Tov</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for building decision tree classiﬁers. The algorithm is executed in a distributed environment and is especially designed for classifying large data sets and streaming data. It is empirically shown to be as accurate as a standard decision tree classiﬁer, while being scalable for processing of streaming data on multiple processors. These ﬁndings are supported by a rigorous analysis of the algorithm’s accuracy. The essence of the algorithm is to quickly construct histograms at the processors, which compress the data to a ﬁxed amount of memory. A master processor uses this information to ﬁnd near-optimal split points to terminal tree nodes. Our analysis shows that guarantees on the local accuracy of split points imply guarantees on the overall tree accuracy.

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Varun Sharma, Uri Shalit, Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Learning a measure of similarity between pairs of objects is an important generic problem in machine learning. It is particularly useful in large scale applications like searching for an image that is similar to a given image or ﬁnding videos that are relevant to a given video. In these tasks, users look for objects that are not only visually similar but also semantically related to a given object. Unfortunately, the approaches that exist today for learning such semantic similarity do not scale to large data sets. This is both because typically their CPU and storage requirements grow quadratically with the sample size, and because many methods impose complex positivity constraints on the space of learned similarity functions. The current paper presents OASIS, an Online Algorithm for Scalable Image Similarity learning that learns a bilinear similarity measure over sparse representations. OASIS is an online dual approach using the passive-aggressive family of learning algorithms with a large margin criterion and an efﬁcient hinge loss cost. Our experiments show that OASIS is both fast and accurate at a wide range of scales: for a data set with thousands of images, it achieves better results than existing state-of-the-art methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. For large, web scale, data sets, OASIS can be trained on more than two million images from 150K text queries within 3 days on a single CPU. On this large scale data set, human evaluations showed that 35% of the ten nearest neighbors of a given test image, as found by OASIS, were semantically relevant to that image. This suggests that query independent similarity could be accurately learned even for large scale data sets that could not be handled before.

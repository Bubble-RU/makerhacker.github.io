<p>Author: Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Ohad Shamir, Nathan Srebro, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: The problem of characterizing learnability is the most basic question of statistical learning theory. A fundamental and long-standing answer, at least for the case of supervised classiﬁcation and regression, is that learnability is equivalent to uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the population risk, and that if a problem is learnable, it is learnable via empirical risk minimization. In this paper, we consider the General Learning Setting (introduced by Vapnik), which includes most statistical learning problems as special cases. We show that in this setting, there are non-trivial learning problems where uniform convergence does not hold, empirical risk minimization fails, and yet they are learnable using alternative mechanisms. Instead of uniform convergence, we identify stability as the key necessary and sufﬁcient condition for learnability. Moreover, we show that the conditions for learnability in the general setting are signiﬁcantly more complex than in supervised classiﬁcation and regression.

Thus for the analysis of algorithms, it is an important problem to be able to assess the quality of such approximations. The contribution of our paper is two-fold: 1. We use a technique based on a concentration inequality for Hilbert spaces to provide new much simpliﬁed proofs for a number of results in spectral approximation. 2. Using these methods we provide several new results for estimating spectral properties of the graph Laplacian operator extending and strengthening results from von Luxburg et al. (2008).

<p>Author: Liva Ralaivola, Marie Szafranski, Guillaume Stempfel</p><p>Abstract: PAC-Bayes bounds are among the most accurate generalization bounds for classiﬁers learned from independently and identically distributed (IID) data, and it is particularly so for margin classiﬁers: there have been recent contributions showing how practical these bounds can be either to perform model selection (Ambroladze et al., 2007) or even to directly guide the learning of linear classiﬁers (Germain et al., 2009). However, there are many practical situations where the training data show some dependencies and where the traditional IID assumption does not hold. Stating generalization bounds for such frameworks is therefore of the utmost interest, both from theoretical and practical standpoints. In this work, we propose the ﬁrst—to the best of our knowledge—PAC-Bayes generalization bounds for classiﬁers trained on data exhibiting interdependencies. The approach undertaken to establish our results is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency graph that encodes the dependencies within the data, in sets of independent data, thanks to graph fractional covers. Our bounds are very general, since being able to ﬁnd an upper bound on the fractional chromatic number of the dependency graph is sufﬁcient to get new PAC-Bayes bounds for speciﬁc settings. We show how our results can be used to derive bounds for ranking statistics (such as AUC) and classiﬁers trained on data distributed according to a stationary β-mixing process. In the way, we show how our approach seamlessly allows us to deal with U-processes. As a side note, we also provide a PAC-Bayes generalization bound for classiﬁers learned on data from stationary ϕ-mixing distributions.

<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev, João Graça, Jennifer Gillenwater, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We present posterior regularization, a probabilistic framework for structured, weakly supervised learning. Our framework efﬁciently incorporates indirect supervision via constraints on posterior distributions of probabilistic models with latent variables. Posterior regularization separates model complexity from the complexity of structural constraints it is desired to satisfy. By directly imposing decomposable regularization on the posterior moments of latent variables during learning, we retain the computational efﬁciency of the unconstrained model while ensuring desired constraints hold in expectation. We present an efﬁcient algorithm for learning with posterior regularization and illustrate its versatility on a diverse set of structural constraints such as bijectivity, symmetry and group sparsity in several large scale experiments, including multi-view learning, cross-lingual dependency grammar induction, unsupervised part-of-speech induction, and bitext word alignment.1 Keywords: posterior regularization framework, unsupervised learning, latent variables models, prior knowledge, natural language processing</p><p>6 0.056702804 <a title="106-tfidf-6" href="./jmlr-2010-Learning_From_Crowds.html">61 jmlr-2010-Learning From Crowds</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Guang Dai, Congfu Xu, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FDA) and its kernel extension—kernel discriminant analysis (KDA)—are well known methods that consider dimensionality reduction and classiﬁcation jointly. While widely deployed in practical problems, there are still unresolved issues surrounding their efﬁcient implementation and their relationship with least mean squares procedures. In this paper we address these issues within the framework of regularized estimation. Our approach leads to a ﬂexible and efﬁcient implementation of FDA as well as KDA. We also uncover a general relationship between regularized discriminant analysis and ridge regression. This relationship yields variations on conventional FDA based on the pseudoinverse and a direct equivalence to an ordinary least squares estimator.

<p>Author: Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis class used, independently of any algorithm. In contrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight generalization bounds that are tailored to speciﬁc learning algorithms by exploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory, existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the samples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence. This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a stationary ϕ-mixing or β-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in the study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between observations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based generalization bounds for stationary ϕ-mixing and β-mixing sequences. These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply to all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of stability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios. We also illustrate the application of our ϕ-mixing generalization bounds to general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression, Kernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel regularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms. These novel bounds can thus be viewed as the ﬁrst theoretical basis for the use of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios.

<p>Author: Dirk Gorissen, Ivo Couckuyt, Piet Demeester, Tom Dhaene, Karel Crombecq</p><p>Abstract: An exceedingly large number of scientiﬁc and engineering ﬁelds are confronted with the need for computer simulations to study complex, real world phenomena or solve challenging design problems. However, due to the computational cost of these high ﬁdelity simulations, the use of neural networks, kernel methods, and other surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable. Surrogate models are compact and cheap to evaluate, and have proven very useful for tasks such as optimization, design space exploration, prototyping, and sensitivity analysis. Consequently, in many ﬁelds there is great interest in tools and techniques that facilitate the construction of such regression models, while minimizing the computational cost and maximizing model accuracy. This paper presents a mature, ﬂexible, and adaptive machine learning toolkit for regression modeling and active learning to tackle these issues. The toolkit brings together algorithms for data ﬁtting, model selection, sample selection (active learning), hyperparameter optimization, and distributed computing in order to empower a domain expert to efﬁciently generate an accurate model for the problem or data at hand. Keywords: surrogate modeling, metamodeling, function approximation, model selection, adaptive sampling, active learning, distributed computing 1. Background and Motivation In many science and engineering problems researchers make heavy use of computer simulation codes in order to replace expensive physical experiments and improve the quality and performance of engineered products and devices. Such simulation activities are collectively referred to as computational science/engineering. Unfortunately, while allowing scientists more ﬂexibility to study phenomena under controlled conditions, computer simulations require a substantial investment of c 2010 Dirk Gorissen, Ivo Couckuyt, Piet Demeester, Tom Dhaene and Karel Crombecq. G ORISSEN , C OUCKUYT, D EMEESTER , D HAENE AND C ROMBECQ computation time. One simulation may take many minutes, hours, days or even weeks, quickly rendering parameter studies impractical (Forrester et al., 2008; Simpson et al., 2008). Of the different ways to deal with this problem, this paper is concerned with the construction of simpler approximation models to predict the system performance and develop a relationship between the system inputs and outputs. When properly constructed, these approximation models mimic the behavior of the simulation accurately while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Different approximation methods exist, each with their relative merits. This work concentrates on the use of data-driven, global approximations using compact surrogate models (also known as metamodels, replacement models, or response surface models). Examples include: rational functions, Kriging models, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN), splines, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Once such a global approximation is available it is of great use for gaining insight into the behavior of the underlying system. The surrogate may be easily queried, optimized, visualized, and seamlessly integrated into CAD/CAE software packages. The challenge is thus how to generate an approximation model that is as accurate as possible over the complete domain of interest while minimizing the simulation cost. Solving this challenge involves multiple sub-problems that must be addressed: how to interface with the simulation code, how to run simulations (locally, or on a cluster or cloud), which model type to approximate the data with and how to set the model complexity (e.g., topology of a neural network), how to estimate the model quality and ensure the domain expert trusts the model, how to decide which simulations to run (data collection), etc. The data collection aspect is worth emphasizing. Since data is computationally expensive to obtain and the optimal data distribution is not known up front, data points should be selected iteratively, there where the information gain will be the greatest. A sampling function is needed that minimizes the number of sample points selected in each iteration, yet maximizes the information gain of each iteration step. This process is called adaptive sampling but is also known as active learning, or sequential design. There is a complex dependency web between these different options and dealing with these dependencies is non-trivial, particularly for a domain expert for whom the surrogate model is just an intermediate step towards solving a larger, more important problem. Few domain experts will be experts in the intricacies of efﬁcient sampling and modeling strategies. Their primary concern is obtaining an accurate replacement metamodel for their problem as fast as possible and with minimal overhead (Gorissen et al., 2009d). As a result these choices are often made in a pragmatic, sometimes even ad-hoc, manner. This paper discusses an advanced, and integrated software framework that provides a ﬂexible and rigorous means to tackle such problems. This work lies at the intersection of Machine Learning/AI, Modeling and Simulation, and Distributed Computing. The methods developed are applicable to any domain where a cheap, accurate, approximation is needed to replace some expensive reference model. Our experience has been that the availability of such a framework can facilitate the transfer of knowledge from surrogate modeling researchers and lower the barrier of entry for domain experts. 2. SUMO Toolbox The platform in question is the Matlab SUrrogate MOdeling (SUMO) Toolbox, illustrated in Figure 1. Given a simulation engine (Fluent, Cadence, Abaqus, HFSS, etc.) or other data source (data 2052 A S URROGATE M ODELING AND A DAPTIVE S AMPLING TOOLBOX FOR C OMPUTER BASED D ESIGN Figure 1: The SUMO Toolbox is a ﬂexible framework for accurate global surrogate modeling and adaptive sampling (active learning). It features a rich set of plugins, is applicable to a wide range of domains, and can be applied in an autonomous, black-box fashion, or under full manual control. Written in Matlab and Java it is fully cross platform and comes with a large (60+) number of example problems. set, Matlab script, Java class, etc.), the toolbox drives the data source to produce a surrogate model within the time and accuracy constraints set by the user. The SUMO Toolbox adopts a microkernel design philosophy with many different plugins available for each of the different sub-problems:1 model types (rational functions, Kriging, splines, SVM, ANN, etc.), hyperparameter optimization algorithms (Particle Swarm Optimization, Efﬁcient Global Optimization, simulated annealing, Genetic Algorithm, etc.), model selection algorithms (cross validation, AIC, Leave-out set, etc.), sample selection (random, error based, density based, hybrid, etc.), Design of Experiments (Latin hypercube, Box-Bhenken, etc.), and sample evaluation methods (local, on a cluster or grid). The behavior of each software component is conﬁgurable through a central XML ﬁle and components can easily be added, removed or replaced by custom implementations. In addition the toolbox provides ‘meta’ plugins. For example to automatically select the best model type for a given problem (Gorissen et al., 2009d) or to use multiple model selection or sample selection criteria in concert (Gorissen et al., 2010). Furthermore, there is built-in support for high performance computing. On the modeling side, the model generation process can take full advantage of multi-core CPUs and even of a complete cluster or grid. This can result in signiﬁcant speedups for model types where the ﬁtting process can be expensive (e.g., neural networks). Likewise, sample evaluation (simulation) can occur locally (with the option to take advantage of multi-core architectures) or on a separate compute cluster or grid (possibly accessed through a remote head-node). All interfacing with the grid middleware 1. The full list of plugins and features can be found at http://www.sumowiki.intec.ugent.be. 2053 G ORISSEN , C OUCKUYT, D EMEESTER , D HAENE AND C ROMBECQ (submission, job monitoring, rescheduling of failed/lost simulation points, etc.) is handled transparently and automatically (see Gorissen et al., 2009c for more details). Also, the sample evaluation component runs in parallel with the other components (non-blocking) and not sequentially. This allows for an optimal use of computational resources. In addition the SUMO Toolbox contains extensive logging and proﬁling capabilities so that the modeling process can easily be tracked and the modeling decisions understood. Once a ﬁnal model has been generated, a GUI tool is available to visually explore the model (including derivatives and prediction uncertainty), assess its quality, and export it for use in other software tools. 3. Applications The SUMO Toolbox has already been applied successfully to a very wide range of applications, including RF circuit block modeling (Gorissen et al., 2009b), hydrological modeling (Couckuyt et al., 2009), Electronic Packaging (Zhu and Franzon, 2009), aerodynamic modeling (Gorissen et al., 2009a), process engineering (Stephens et al., 2009), and automotive data modeling (Gorissen et al., 2010). Besides global modeling capabilities, the SUMO Toolbox also includes a powerful optimization framework based on the Efﬁcient Global Optimization framework developed by Jones et al. (1998). As of version 6.1, the toolbox also contains an example of how the framework can also be applied to solve classiﬁcation problems. In sum, the goal of the toolbox is to ﬁll the void in machine learning software when it comes to the challenging, costly, real-valued, problems faced in computational engineering. The toolbox is in use successfully at various institutions and we are continuously reﬁning and extending the set of available plugins as the number of applications increase.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Ohad Shamir, Nathan Srebro, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: The problem of characterizing learnability is the most basic question of statistical learning theory. A fundamental and long-standing answer, at least for the case of supervised classiﬁcation and regression, is that learnability is equivalent to uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the population risk, and that if a problem is learnable, it is learnable via empirical risk minimization. In this paper, we consider the General Learning Setting (introduced by Vapnik), which includes most statistical learning problems as special cases. We show that in this setting, there are non-trivial learning problems where uniform convergence does not hold, empirical risk minimization fails, and yet they are learnable using alternative mechanisms. Instead of uniform convergence, we identify stability as the key necessary and sufﬁcient condition for learnability. Moreover, we show that the conditions for learnability in the general setting are signiﬁcantly more complex than in supervised classiﬁcation and regression.

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Varun Sharma, Uri Shalit, Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Learning a measure of similarity between pairs of objects is an important generic problem in machine learning. It is particularly useful in large scale applications like searching for an image that is similar to a given image or ﬁnding videos that are relevant to a given video. In these tasks, users look for objects that are not only visually similar but also semantically related to a given object. Unfortunately, the approaches that exist today for learning such semantic similarity do not scale to large data sets. This is both because typically their CPU and storage requirements grow quadratically with the sample size, and because many methods impose complex positivity constraints on the space of learned similarity functions. The current paper presents OASIS, an Online Algorithm for Scalable Image Similarity learning that learns a bilinear similarity measure over sparse representations. OASIS is an online dual approach using the passive-aggressive family of learning algorithms with a large margin criterion and an efﬁcient hinge loss cost. Our experiments show that OASIS is both fast and accurate at a wide range of scales: for a data set with thousands of images, it achieves better results than existing state-of-the-art methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. For large, web scale, data sets, OASIS can be trained on more than two million images from 150K text queries within 3 days on a single CPU. On this large scale data set, human evaluations showed that 35% of the ten nearest neighbors of a given test image, as found by OASIS, were semantically relevant to that image. This suggests that query independent similarity could be accurately learned even for large scale data sets that could not be handled before.

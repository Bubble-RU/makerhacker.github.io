<p>Author: Rahul Mazumder, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani</p><p>Abstract: We use convex relaxation techniques to provide a sequence of regularized low-rank solutions for large-scale matrix completion problems. Using the nuclear norm as a regularizer, we provide a simple and very efﬁcient convex algorithm for minimizing the reconstruction error subject to a bound on the nuclear norm. Our algorithm S OFT-I MPUTE iteratively replaces the missing elements with those obtained from a soft-thresholded SVD. With warm starts this allows us to efﬁciently compute an entire regularization path of solutions on a grid of values of the regularization parameter. The computationally intensive part of our algorithm is in computing a low-rank SVD of a dense matrix. Exploiting the problem structure, we show that the task can be performed with a complexity of order linear in the matrix dimensions. Our semideﬁnite-programming algorithm is readily scalable to large matrices; for example S OFT-I MPUTE takes a few hours to compute low-rank approximations of a 106 × 106 incomplete matrix with 107 observed entries, and ﬁts a rank-95 approximation to the full Netﬂix training set in 3.3 hours. Our methods achieve good training and test errors and exhibit superior timings when compared to other competitive state-of-the-art techniques.

<p>Author: Andreas Argyriou, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning a matrix W from a set of linear measurements. Our formulation consists in solving an optimization problem which involves regularization with a spectral penalty term. That is, the penalty term is a function of the spectrum of the covariance of W . Instances of this problem in machine learning include multi-task learning, collaborative ﬁltering and multi-view learning, among others. Our goal is to elucidate the form of the optimal solution of spectral learning. The theory of spectral learning relies on the von Neumann characterization of orthogonally invariant norms and their association with symmetric gauge functions. Using this tool we formulate a representer theorem for spectral regularization and specify it to several useful example, such as Schatten p−norms, trace norm and spectral norm, which should proved useful in applications.

<p>Author: Ming Yuan</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating a high dimensional inverse covariance matrix that can be well approximated by “sparse” matrices. Taking advantage of the connection between multivariate linear regression and entries of the inverse covariance matrix, we propose an estimating procedure that can effectively exploit such “sparsity”. The proposed method can be computed using linear programming and therefore has the potential to be used in very high dimensional problems. Oracle inequalities are established for the estimation error in terms of several operator norms, showing that the method is adaptive to different types of sparsity of the problem.

<p>Author: Arthur Gretton, László Györfi</p><p>Abstract: Three simple and explicit procedures for testing the independence of two multi-dimensional random variables are described. Two of the associated test statistics (L1 , log-likelihood) are deﬁned when the empirical distribution of the variables is restricted to ﬁnite partitions. A third test statistic is deﬁned as a kernel-based independence measure. Two kinds of tests are provided. Distributionfree strong consistent tests are derived on the basis of large deviation bounds on the test statistics: these tests make almost surely no Type I or Type II error after a random sample size. Asymptotically α-level tests are obtained from the limiting distribution of the test statistics. For the latter tests, the Type I error converges to a ﬁxed non-zero value α, and the Type II error drops to zero, for increasing sample size. All tests reject the null hypothesis of independence if the test statistics become large. The performance of the tests is evaluated experimentally on benchmark data.

<p>Author: Lorenzo Rosasco, Mikhail Belkin, Ernesto De Vito</p><p>Abstract: A large number of learning algorithms, for example, spectral clustering, kernel Principal Components Analysis and many manifold methods are based on estimating eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of operators deﬁned by a similarity function or a kernel, given empirical data. Thus for the analysis of algorithms, it is an important problem to be able to assess the quality of such approximations. The contribution of our paper is two-fold: 1. We use a technique based on a concentration inequality for Hilbert spaces to provide new much simpliﬁed proofs for a number of results in spectral approximation. 2. Using these methods we provide several new results for estimating spectral properties of the graph Laplacian operator extending and strengthening results from von Luxburg et al. (2008).

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Kamaledin Ghiasi-Shirazi, Reza Safabakhsh, Mostafa Shamsi</p><p>Abstract: Appropriate selection of the kernel function, which implicitly deﬁnes the feature space of an algorithm, has a crucial role in the success of kernel methods. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing a kernel function over the class of translation invariant kernels for the task of binary classiﬁcation. The learning capacity of this class is invariant with respect to rotation and scaling of the features and it encompasses the set of radial kernels. We show that how translation invariant kernel functions can be embedded in a nested set of sub-classes and consider the kernel learning problem over one of these sub-classes. This allows the choice of an appropriate sub-class based on the problem at hand. We use the criterion proposed by Lanckriet et al. (2004) to obtain a functional formulation for the problem. It will be proven that the optimal kernel is a ﬁnite mixture of cosine functions. The kernel learning problem is then formulated as a semi-inﬁnite programming (SIP) problem which is solved by a sequence of quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) sub-problems. Using the fact that the cosine kernel is of rank two, we propose a formulation of a QCQP sub-problem which does not require the kernel matrices to be loaded into memory, making the method applicable to large-scale problems. We also address the issue of including other classes of kernels, such as individual kernels and isotropic Gaussian kernels, in the learning process. Another interesting feature of the proposed method is that the optimal classiﬁer has an expansion in terms of the number of cosine kernels, instead of support vectors, leading to a remarkable speedup at run-time. As a by-product, we also generalize the kernel trick to complex-valued kernel functions. Our experiments on artiﬁcial and real-world benchmark data sets, including the USPS and the MNIST digit recognition data sets, show the usefulness of the proposed method.

<p>Author: Kuzman Ganchev, João Graça, Jennifer Gillenwater, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We present posterior regularization, a probabilistic framework for structured, weakly supervised learning. Our framework efﬁciently incorporates indirect supervision via constraints on posterior distributions of probabilistic models with latent variables. Posterior regularization separates model complexity from the complexity of structural constraints it is desired to satisfy. By directly imposing decomposable regularization on the posterior moments of latent variables during learning, we retain the computational efﬁciency of the unconstrained model while ensuring desired constraints hold in expectation. We present an efﬁcient algorithm for learning with posterior regularization and illustrate its versatility on a diverse set of structural constraints such as bijectivity, symmetry and group sparsity in several large scale experiments, including multi-view learning, cross-lingual dependency grammar induction, unsupervised part-of-speech induction, and bitext word alignment.1 Keywords: posterior regularization framework, unsupervised learning, latent variables models, prior knowledge, natural language processing</p><p>5 0.47705695 <a title="72-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2010-Lp-Nested_Symmetric_Distributions.html">69 jmlr-2010-Lp-Nested Symmetric Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian Sinz, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new family of probability densities called L p -nested symmetric distributions. The common property, shared by all members of the new class, is the same functional form ˜ x x ρ(x ) = ρ( f (x )), where f is a nested cascade of L p -norms x p = (∑ |xi | p )1/p . L p -nested symmetric distributions thereby are a special case of ν-spherical distributions for which f is only required to be positively homogeneous of degree one. While both, ν-spherical and L p -nested symmetric distributions, contain many widely used families of probability models such as the Gaussian, spherically and elliptically symmetric distributions, L p -spherically symmetric distributions, and certain types of independent component analysis (ICA) and independent subspace analysis (ISA) models, ν-spherical distributions are usually computationally intractable. Here we demonstrate that L p nested symmetric distributions are still computationally feasible by deriving an analytic expression for its normalization constant, gradients for maximum likelihood estimation, analytic expressions for certain types of marginals, as well as an exact and efﬁcient sampling algorithm. We discuss the tight links of L p -nested symmetric distributions to well known machine learning methods such as ICA, ISA and mixed norm regularizers, and introduce the nested radial factorization algorithm (NRF), which is a form of non-linear ICA that transforms any linearly mixed, non-factorial L p nested symmetric source into statistically independent signals. As a corollary, we also introduce the uniform distribution on the L p -nested unit sphere.

<p>Author: Jacek P. Dmochowski, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: The presence of asymmetry in the misclassiﬁcation costs or class prevalences is a common occurrence in the pattern classiﬁcation domain. While much interest has been devoted to the study of cost-sensitive learning techniques, the relationship between cost-sensitive learning and the speciﬁcation of the model set in a parametric estimation framework remains somewhat unclear. To that end, we differentiate between the case of the model including the true posterior, and that in which the model is misspeciﬁed. In the former case, it is shown that thresholding the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate is an asymptotically optimal solution to the risk minimization problem. On the other hand, under model misspeciﬁcation, it is demonstrated that thresholded ML is suboptimal and that the risk-minimizing solution varies with the misclassiﬁcation cost ratio. Moreover, we analytically show that the negative weighted log likelihood (Elkan, 2001) is a tight, convex upper bound of the empirical loss. Coupled with empirical results on several real-world data sets, we argue that weighted ML is the preferred cost-sensitive technique.

<p>Author: Dotan Di Castro, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-Critic based approaches were among the ﬁrst to address reinforcement learning in a general setting. Recently, these algorithms have gained renewed interest due to their generality, good convergence properties, and possible biological relevance. In this paper, we introduce an online temporal difference based actor-critic algorithm which is proved to converge to a neighborhood of a local maximum of the average reward. Linear function approximation is used by the critic in order estimate the value function, and the temporal difference signal, which is passed from the critic to the actor. The main distinguishing feature of the present convergence proof is that both the actor and the critic operate on a similar time scale, while in most current convergence proofs they are required to have very different time scales in order to converge. Moreover, the same temporal difference signal is used to update the parameters of both the actor and the critic. A limitation of the proposed approach, compared to results available for two time scale convergence, is that convergence is guaranteed only to a neighborhood of an optimal value, rather to an optimal value itself. The single time scale and identical temporal difference signal used by the actor and the critic, may provide a step towards constructing more biologically realistic models of reinforcement learning in the brain.

<p>Author: Jianing Shi, Wotao Yin, Stanley Osher, Paul Sajda</p><p>Abstract: ℓ1 -regularized logistic regression, also known as sparse logistic regression, is widely used in machine learning, computer vision, data mining, bioinformatics and neural signal processing. The use of ℓ1 regularization attributes attractive properties to the classiﬁer, such as feature selection, robustness to noise, and as a result, classiﬁer generality in the context of supervised learning. When a sparse logistic regression problem has large-scale data in high dimensions, it is computationally expensive to minimize the non-differentiable ℓ1 -norm in the objective function. Motivated by recent work (Koh et al., 2007; Hale et al., 2008), we propose a novel hybrid algorithm based on combining two types of optimization iterations: one being very fast and memory friendly while the other being slower but more accurate. Called hybrid iterative shrinkage (HIS), the resulting algorithm is comprised of a ﬁxed point continuation phase and an interior point phase. The ﬁrst phase is based completely on memory efﬁcient operations such as matrix-vector multiplications, while the second phase is based on a truncated Newton’s method. Furthermore, we show that various optimization techniques, including line search and continuation, can signiﬁcantly accelerate convergence. The algorithm has global convergence at a geometric rate (a Q-linear rate in optimization terminology). We present a numerical comparison with several existing algorithms, including an analysis using benchmark data from the UCI machine learning repository, and show our algorithm is the most computationally efﬁcient without loss of accuracy.

<p>Author: Valero Laparra, Juan Gutiérrez, Gustavo Camps-Valls, Jesús Malo</p><p>Abstract: A successful class of image denoising methods is based on Bayesian approaches working in wavelet representations. The performance of these methods improves when relations among the local frequency coefﬁcients are explicitly included. However, in these techniques, analytical estimates can be obtained only for particular combinations of analytical models of signal and noise, thus precluding its straightforward extension to deal with other arbitrary noise sources. In this paper, we propose an alternative non-explicit way to take into account the relations among natural image wavelet coefﬁcients for denoising: we use support vector regression (SVR) in the wavelet domain to enforce these relations in the estimated signal. Since relations among the coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to the signal, the regularization property of SVR is exploited to remove the noise, which does not share this feature. The speciﬁc signal relations are encoded in an anisotropic kernel obtained from mutual information measures computed on a representative image database. In the proposed scheme, training considers minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the estimated and actual probability functions (or histograms) of signal and noise in order to enforce similarity up to the higher (computationally estimable) order. Due to its non-parametric nature, the method can eventually cope with different noise sources without the need of an explicit re-formulation, as it is strictly necessary under parametric Bayesian formalisms. Results under several noise levels and noise sources show that: (1) the proposed method outperforms conventional wavelet methods that assume coefﬁcient independence, (2) it is similar to state-of-the-art methods that do explicitly include these relations when the noise source is Gaussian, and (3) it gives better numerical and visual performance when more complex, realistic noise sources are considered. Therefore, the proposed machine learning approach can be seen as a mor</p><p>6 0.042687103 <a title="101-tfidf-6" href="./jmlr-2010-Learning_Non-Stationary_Dynamic_Bayesian_Networks.html">64 jmlr-2010-Learning Non-Stationary Dynamic Bayesian Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Christoforos Christoforou, Robert Haralick, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: Traditional analysis methods for single-trial classiﬁcation of electro-encephalography (EEG) focus on two types of paradigms: phase-locked methods, in which the amplitude of the signal is used as the feature for classiﬁcation, that is, event related potentials; and second-order methods, in which the feature of interest is the power of the signal, that is, event related (de)synchronization. The process of deciding which paradigm to use is ad hoc and is driven by assumptions regarding the underlying neural generators. Here we propose a method that provides an uniﬁed framework for the analysis of EEG, combining ﬁrst and second-order spatial and temporal features based on a bilinear model. Evaluation of the proposed method on simulated data shows that the technique outperforms state-of-the art techniques for single-trial classiﬁcation for a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios. Evaluations on human EEG—including one benchmark data set from the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) competition—show statistically signiﬁcant gains in classiﬁcation accuracy, with a reduction in overall classiﬁcation error from 26%-28% to 19%.

<p>Author: Ming Yuan, Marten Wegkamp</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of binary classiﬁcation with a reject option in which one can withhold the decision of classifying an observation at a cost lower than that of misclassiﬁcation. Since the natural loss function is non-convex so that empirical risk minimization easily becomes infeasible, the paper proposes minimizing convex risks based on surrogate convex loss functions. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for inﬁnite sample consistency (both risks share the same minimizer) is provided. Moreover, we show that the excess risk can be bounded through the excess surrogate risk under appropriate conditions. These bounds can be tightened by a generalized margin condition. The impact of the results is illustrated on several commonly used surrogate loss functions.

<p>Author: Jacek P. Dmochowski, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: The presence of asymmetry in the misclassiﬁcation costs or class prevalences is a common occurrence in the pattern classiﬁcation domain. While much interest has been devoted to the study of cost-sensitive learning techniques, the relationship between cost-sensitive learning and the speciﬁcation of the model set in a parametric estimation framework remains somewhat unclear. To that end, we differentiate between the case of the model including the true posterior, and that in which the model is misspeciﬁed. In the former case, it is shown that thresholding the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate is an asymptotically optimal solution to the risk minimization problem. On the other hand, under model misspeciﬁcation, it is demonstrated that thresholded ML is suboptimal and that the risk-minimizing solution varies with the misclassiﬁcation cost ratio. Moreover, we analytically show that the negative weighted log likelihood (Elkan, 2001) is a tight, convex upper bound of the empirical loss. Coupled with empirical results on several real-world data sets, we argue that weighted ML is the preferred cost-sensitive technique.

<p>Author: Gilles Blanchard, Gyemin Lee, Clayton Scott</p><p>Abstract: A common setting for novelty detection assumes that labeled examples from the nominal class are available, but that labeled examples of novelties are unavailable. The standard (inductive) approach is to declare novelties where the nominal density is low, which reduces the problem to density level set estimation. In this paper, we consider the setting where an unlabeled and possibly contaminated sample is also available at learning time. We argue that novelty detection in this semi-supervised setting is naturally solved by a general reduction to a binary classiﬁcation problem. In particular, a detector with a desired false positive rate can be achieved through a reduction to Neyman-Pearson classiﬁcation. Unlike the inductive approach, semi-supervised novelty detection (SSND) yields detectors that are optimal (e.g., statistically consistent) regardless of the distribution on novelties. Therefore, in novelty detection, unlabeled data have a substantial impact on the theoretical properties of the decision rule. We validate the practical utility of SSND with an extensive experimental study. We also show that SSND provides distribution-free, learning-theoretic solutions to two well known problems in hypothesis testing. First, our results provide a general solution to the general two-sample problem, that is, the problem of determining whether two random samples arise from the same distribution. Second, a specialization of SSND coincides with the standard p-value approach to multiple testing under the so-called random effects model. Unlike standard rejection regions based on thresholded p-values, the general SSND framework allows for adaptation to arbitrary alternative distributions in multiple dimensions.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

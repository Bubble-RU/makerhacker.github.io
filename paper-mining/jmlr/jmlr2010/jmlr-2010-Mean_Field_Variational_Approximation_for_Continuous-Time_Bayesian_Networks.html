<p>Author: Yu Fan, Jing Xu, Christian R. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: A continuous time Bayesian network (CTBN) uses a structured representation to describe a dynamic system with a ﬁnite number of states which evolves in continuous time. Exact inference in a CTBN is often intractable as the state space of the dynamic system grows exponentially with the number of variables. In this paper, we ﬁrst present an approximate inference algorithm based on importance sampling. We then extend it to continuous-time particle ﬁltering and smoothing algorithms. These three algorithms can estimate the expectation of any function of a trajectory, conditioned on any evidence set constraining the values of subsets of the variables over subsets of the time line. We present experimental results on both synthetic networks and a network learned from a real data set on people’s life history events. We show the accuracy as well as the time efﬁciency of our algorithms, and compare them to other approximate algorithms: expectation propagation and Gibbs sampling.

<p>Author: Joshua W. Robinson, Alexander J. Hartemink</p><p>Abstract: Learning dynamic Bayesian network structures provides a principled mechanism for identifying conditional dependencies in time-series data. An important assumption of traditional DBN structure learning is that the data are generated by a stationary process, an assumption that is not true in many important settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of graphical model called a nonstationary dynamic Bayesian network, in which the conditional dependence structure of the underlying data-generation process is permitted to change over time. Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks represent a new framework for studying problems in which the structure of a network is evolving over time. Some examples of evolving networks are transcriptional regulatory networks during an organism’s development, neural pathways during learning, and trafﬁc patterns during the day. We deﬁne the non-stationary DBN model, present an MCMC sampling algorithm for learning the structure of the model from time-series data under different assumptions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on both simulated and biological data.

<p>Author: Yevgeny Seldin, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: We derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for supervised and unsupervised learning models based on clustering, such as co-clustering, matrix tri-factorization, graphical models, graph clustering, and pairwise clustering.1 We begin with the analysis of co-clustering, which is a widely used approach to the analysis of data matrices. We distinguish among two tasks in matrix data analysis: discriminative prediction of the missing entries in data matrices and estimation of the joint probability distribution of row and column variables in co-occurrence matrices. We derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for the expected out-of-sample performance of co-clustering-based solutions for these two tasks. The analysis yields regularization terms that were absent in the previous formulations of co-clustering. The bounds suggest that the expected performance of co-clustering is governed by a trade-off between its empirical performance and the mutual information preserved by the cluster variables on row and column IDs. We derive an iterative projection algorithm for ﬁnding a local optimum of this trade-off for discriminative prediction tasks. This algorithm achieved stateof-the-art performance in the MovieLens collaborative ﬁltering task. Our co-clustering model can also be seen as matrix tri-factorization and the results provide generalization bounds, regularization terms, and new algorithms for this form of matrix factorization. The analysis of co-clustering is extended to tree-shaped graphical models, which can be used to analyze high dimensional tensors. According to the bounds, the generalization abilities of treeshaped graphical models depend on a trade-off between their empirical data ﬁt and the mutual information that is propagated up the tree levels. We also formulate weighted graph clustering as a prediction problem: given a subset of edge weights we analyze the ability of graph clustering to predict the remaining edge weights.

<p>Author: Evangelos Theodorou, Jonas Buchli, Stefan Schaal</p><p>Abstract: With the goal to generate more scalable algorithms with higher efﬁciency and fewer open parameters, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently moved towards combining classical techniques from optimal control and dynamic programming with modern learning techniques from statistical estimation theory. In this vein, this paper suggests to use the framework of stochastic optimal control with path integrals to derive a novel approach to RL with parameterized policies. While solidly grounded in value function estimation and optimal control based on the stochastic Hamilton-JacobiBellman (HJB) equations, policy improvements can be transformed into an approximation problem of a path integral which has no open algorithmic parameters other than the exploration noise. The resulting algorithm can be conceived of as model-based, semi-model-based, or even model free, depending on how the learning problem is structured. The update equations have no danger of numerical instabilities as neither matrix inversions nor gradient learning rates are required. Our new algorithm demonstrates interesting similarities with previous RL research in the framework of probability matching and provides intuition why the slightly heuristically motivated probability matching approach can actually perform well. Empirical evaluations demonstrate signiﬁcant performance improvements over gradient-based policy learning and scalability to high-dimensional control problems. Finally, a learning experiment on a simulated 12 degree-of-freedom robot dog illustrates the functionality of our algorithm in a complex robot learning scenario. We believe that Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2 ) offers currently one of the most efﬁcient, numerically robust, and easy to implement algorithms for RL based on trajectory roll-outs.

<p>Author: Gérard Biau, Frédéric Cérou, Arnaud Guyader</p><p>Abstract: Bagging is a simple way to combine estimates in order to improve their performance. This method, suggested by Breiman in 1996, proceeds by resampling from the original data set, constructing a predictor from each subsample, and decide by combining. By bagging an n-sample, the crude nearest neighbor regression estimate is turned into a consistent weighted nearest neighbor regression estimate, which is amenable to statistical analysis. Letting the resampling size kn grows appropriately with n, it is shown that this estimate may achieve optimal rate of convergence, independently from the fact that resampling is done with or without replacement. Since the estimate with the optimal rate of convergence depends on the unknown distribution of the observations, adaptation results by data-splitting are presented.

<p>Author: Yu Fan, Jing Xu, Christian R. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: A continuous time Bayesian network (CTBN) uses a structured representation to describe a dynamic system with a ﬁnite number of states which evolves in continuous time. Exact inference in a CTBN is often intractable as the state space of the dynamic system grows exponentially with the number of variables. In this paper, we ﬁrst present an approximate inference algorithm based on importance sampling. We then extend it to continuous-time particle ﬁltering and smoothing algorithms. These three algorithms can estimate the expectation of any function of a trajectory, conditioned on any evidence set constraining the values of subsets of the variables over subsets of the time line. We present experimental results on both synthetic networks and a network learned from a real data set on people’s life history events. We show the accuracy as well as the time efﬁciency of our algorithms, and compare them to other approximate algorithms: expectation propagation and Gibbs sampling.

<p>Author: Jure Leskovec, Deepayan Chakrabarti, Jon Kleinberg, Christos Faloutsos, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: How can we generate realistic networks? In addition, how can we do so with a mathematically tractable model that allows for rigorous analysis of network properties? Real networks exhibit a long list of surprising properties: Heavy tails for the in- and out-degree distribution, heavy tails for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, small diameters, and densiﬁcation and shrinking diameters over time. Current network models and generators either fail to match several of the above properties, are complicated to analyze mathematically, or both. Here we propose a generative model for networks that is both mathematically tractable and can generate networks that have all the above mentioned structural properties. Our main idea here is to use a non-standard matrix operation, the Kronecker product, to generate graphs which we refer to as “Kronecker graphs”. First, we show that Kronecker graphs naturally obey common network properties. In fact, we rigorously prove that they do so. We also provide empirical evidence showing that Kronecker graphs can effectively model the structure of real networks. We then present K RON F IT, a fast and scalable algorithm for ﬁtting the Kronecker graph generation model to large real networks. A naive approach to ﬁtting would take super-exponential time. In contrast, K RON F IT takes linear time, by exploiting the structure of Kronecker matrix multiplication and by using statistical simulation techniques. Experiments on a wide range of large real and synthetic networks show that K RON F IT ﬁnds accurate parameters that very well mimic the properties of target networks. In fact, using just c 2010 Jure Leskovec, Deepayan Chakrabarti, Jon Kleinberg, Christos Faloutsos and Zoubin Ghahramani.

<p>Author: András György, Gábor Lugosi, György Ottucsàk</p><p>Abstract: We consider a sequential version of the classical bin packing problem in which items are received one by one. Before the size of the next item is revealed, the decision maker needs to decide whether the next item is packed in the currently open bin or the bin is closed and a new bin is opened. If the new item does not ﬁt, it is lost. If a bin is closed, the remaining free space in the bin accounts for a loss. The goal of the decision maker is to minimize the loss accumulated over n periods. We present an algorithm that has a cumulative loss not much larger than any strategy in a ﬁnite class of reference strategies for any sequence of items. Special attention is payed to reference strategies that use a ﬁxed threshold at each step to decide whether a new bin is opened. Some positive and negative results are presented for this case.

<p>Author: Joshua V. Dillon, Guy Lebanon</p><p>Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimators are often of limited practical use due to the intensive computation they require. We propose a family of alternative estimators that maximize a stochastic variation of the composite likelihood function. Each of the estimators resolve the computation-accuracy tradeoff differently, and taken together they span a continuous spectrum of computation-accuracy tradeoff resolutions. We prove the consistency of the estimators, provide formulas for their asymptotic variance, statistical robustness, and computational complexity. We discuss experimental results in the context of Boltzmann machines and conditional random ﬁelds. The theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimators when the computational resources are insufﬁcient. They also demonstrate that in some cases reduced computational complexity is associated with robustness thereby increasing statistical accuracy.

<p>Author: Shiliang Sun, John Shawe-Taylor</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general framework for sparse semi-supervised learning, which concerns using a small portion of unlabeled data and a few labeled data to represent target functions and thus has the merit of accelerating function evaluations when predicting the output of a new example. This framework makes use of Fenchel-Legendre conjugates to rewrite a convex insensitive loss involving a regularization with unlabeled data, and is applicable to a family of semi-supervised learning methods such as multi-view co-regularized least squares and single-view Laplacian support vector machines (SVMs). As an instantiation of this framework, we propose sparse multi-view SVMs which use a squared ε-insensitive loss. The resultant optimization is an inf-sup problem and the optimal solutions have arguably saddle-point properties. We present a globally optimal iterative algorithm to optimize the problem. We give the margin bound on the generalization error of the sparse multi-view SVMs, and derive the empirical Rademacher complexity for the induced function class. Experiments on artiﬁcial and real-world data show their effectiveness. We further give a sequential training approach to show their possibility and potential for uses in large-scale problems and provide encouraging experimental results indicating the efﬁcacy of the margin bound and empirical Rademacher complexity on characterizing the roles of unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning.

<p>Author: Jitkomut Songsiri, Lieven Vandenberghe</p><p>Abstract: An algorithm is presented for topology selection in graphical models of autoregressive Gaussian time series. The graph topology of the model represents the sparsity pattern of the inverse spectrum of the time series and characterizes conditional independence relations between the variables. The method proposed in the paper is based on an ℓ1 -type nonsmooth regularization of the conditional maximum likelihood estimation problem. We show that this reduces to a convex optimization problem and describe a large-scale algorithm that solves the dual problem via the gradient projection method. Results of experiments with randomly generated and real data sets are also included.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Konrad Rieck, Tammo Krueger, Ulf Brefeld, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Convolution kernels for trees provide simple means for learning with tree-structured data. The computation time of tree kernels is quadratic in the size of the trees, since all pairs of nodes need to be compared. Thus, large parse trees, obtained from HTML documents or structured network data, render convolution kernels inapplicable. In this article, we propose an effective approximation technique for parse tree kernels. The approximate tree kernels (ATKs) limit kernel computation to a sparse subset of relevant subtrees and discard redundant structures, such that training and testing of kernel-based learning methods are signiﬁcantly accelerated. We devise linear programming approaches for identifying such subsets for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, respectively. Empirically, the approximate tree kernels attain run-time improvements up to three orders of magnitude while preserving the predictive accuracy of regular tree kernels. For unsupervised tasks, the approximate tree kernels even lead to more accurate predictions by identifying relevant dimensions in feature space.

<p>Author: Gilles Blanchard, Gyemin Lee, Clayton Scott</p><p>Abstract: A common setting for novelty detection assumes that labeled examples from the nominal class are available, but that labeled examples of novelties are unavailable. The standard (inductive) approach is to declare novelties where the nominal density is low, which reduces the problem to density level set estimation. In this paper, we consider the setting where an unlabeled and possibly contaminated sample is also available at learning time. We argue that novelty detection in this semi-supervised setting is naturally solved by a general reduction to a binary classiﬁcation problem. In particular, a detector with a desired false positive rate can be achieved through a reduction to Neyman-Pearson classiﬁcation. Unlike the inductive approach, semi-supervised novelty detection (SSND) yields detectors that are optimal (e.g., statistically consistent) regardless of the distribution on novelties. Therefore, in novelty detection, unlabeled data have a substantial impact on the theoretical properties of the decision rule. We validate the practical utility of SSND with an extensive experimental study. We also show that SSND provides distribution-free, learning-theoretic solutions to two well known problems in hypothesis testing. First, our results provide a general solution to the general two-sample problem, that is, the problem of determining whether two random samples arise from the same distribution. Second, a specialization of SSND coincides with the standard p-value approach to multiple testing under the so-called random effects model. Unlike standard rejection regions based on thresholded p-values, the general SSND framework allows for adaptation to arbitrary alternative distributions in multiple dimensions.

<p>Author: Rahul Mazumder, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani</p><p>Abstract: We use convex relaxation techniques to provide a sequence of regularized low-rank solutions for large-scale matrix completion problems. Using the nuclear norm as a regularizer, we provide a simple and very efﬁcient convex algorithm for minimizing the reconstruction error subject to a bound on the nuclear norm. Our algorithm S OFT-I MPUTE iteratively replaces the missing elements with those obtained from a soft-thresholded SVD. With warm starts this allows us to efﬁciently compute an entire regularization path of solutions on a grid of values of the regularization parameter. The computationally intensive part of our algorithm is in computing a low-rank SVD of a dense matrix. Exploiting the problem structure, we show that the task can be performed with a complexity of order linear in the matrix dimensions. Our semideﬁnite-programming algorithm is readily scalable to large matrices; for example S OFT-I MPUTE takes a few hours to compute low-rank approximations of a 106 × 106 incomplete matrix with 107 observed entries, and ﬁts a rank-95 approximation to the full Netﬂix training set in 3.3 hours. Our methods achieve good training and test errors and exhibit superior timings when compared to other competitive state-of-the-art techniques.

<p>Author: Pradeep Ravikumar, Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: The problem of computing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) conﬁguration is a central computational challenge associated with Markov random ﬁelds. There has been some focus on “tree-based” linear programming (LP) relaxations for the MAP problem. This paper develops a family of super-linearly convergent algorithms for solving these LPs, based on proximal minimization schemes using Bregman divergences. As with standard message-passing on graphs, the algorithms are distributed and exploit the underlying graphical structure, and so scale well to large problems. Our algorithms have a double-loop character, with the outer loop corresponding to the proximal sequence, and an inner loop of cyclic Bregman projections used to compute each proximal update. We establish convergence guarantees for our algorithms, and illustrate their performance via some simulations. We also develop two classes of rounding schemes, deterministic and randomized, for obtaining integral conﬁgurations from the LP solutions. Our deterministic rounding schemes use a “re-parameterization” property of our algorithms so that when the LP solution is integral, the MAP solution can be obtained even before the LP-solver converges to the optimum. We also propose graph-structured randomized rounding schemes applicable to iterative LP-solving algorithms in general. We analyze the performance of and report simulations comparing these rounding schemes.

<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Martin J. Wainwright, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Methods based on ℓ1 -relaxation, such as basis pursuit and the Lasso, are very popular for sparse regression in high dimensions. The conditions for success of these methods are now well-understood: (1) exact recovery in the noiseless setting is possible if and only if the design matrix X satisﬁes the restricted nullspace property, and (2) the squared ℓ2 -error of a Lasso estimate decays at the minimax optimal rate k log p , where k is the sparsity of the p-dimensional regression problem with additive n Gaussian noise, whenever the design satisﬁes a restricted eigenvalue condition. The key issue is thus to determine when the design matrix X satisﬁes these desirable properties. Thus far, there have been numerous results showing that the restricted isometry property, which implies both the restricted nullspace and eigenvalue conditions, is satisﬁed when all entries of X are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), or the rows are unitary. This paper proves directly that the restricted nullspace and eigenvalue conditions hold with high probability for quite general classes of Gaussian matrices for which the predictors may be highly dependent, and hence restricted isometry conditions can be violated with high probability. In this way, our results extend the attractive theoretical guarantees on ℓ1 -relaxations to a much broader class of problems than the case of completely independent or unitary designs.

<p>Author: Ming Yuan</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating a high dimensional inverse covariance matrix that can be well approximated by “sparse” matrices. Taking advantage of the connection between multivariate linear regression and entries of the inverse covariance matrix, we propose an estimating procedure that can effectively exploit such “sparsity”. The proposed method can be computed using linear programming and therefore has the potential to be used in very high dimensional problems. Oracle inequalities are established for the estimation error in terms of several operator norms, showing that the method is adaptive to different types of sparsity of the problem.

<p>Author: Fei Ye, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider the estimation of regression coefﬁcients in a high-dimensional linear model. For regression coefﬁcients in ℓr balls, we provide lower bounds for the minimax ℓq risk and minimax quantiles of the ℓq loss for all design matrices. Under an ℓ0 sparsity condition on a target coefﬁcient vector, we sharpen and unify existing oracle inequalities for the Lasso and Dantzig selector. We derive oracle inequalities for target coefﬁcient vectors with many small elements and smaller threshold levels than the universal threshold. These oracle inequalities provide sufﬁcient conditions on the design matrix for the rate minimaxity of the Lasso and Dantzig selector for the ℓq risk and loss in ℓr balls, 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 ≤ q ≤ ∞. By allowing q = ∞, our risk bounds imply the variable selection consistency of threshold Lasso and Dantzig selectors.

<p>Author: Dapo Omidiran, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of high-dimensional variable selection: given n noisy observations of a k-sparse vector β∗ ∈ R p , estimate the subset of non-zero entries of β∗ . A signiﬁcant body of work has studied behavior of ℓ1 -relaxations when applied to random measurement matrices that are dense (e.g., Gaussian, Bernoulli). In this paper, we analyze sparsiﬁed measurement ensembles, and consider the trade-off between measurement sparsity, as measured by the fraction γ of nonzero entries, and the statistical efﬁciency, as measured by the minimal number of observations n required for correct variable selection with probability converging to one. Our main result is to prove that it is possible to let the fraction on non-zero entries γ → 0 at some rate, yielding measurement matrices with a vanishing fraction of non-zeros per row, while retaining the same statistical efﬁciency as dense ensembles. A variety of simulation results conﬁrm the sharpness of our theoretical predictions.

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider learning formulations with non-convex objective functions that often occur in practical applications. There are two approaches to this problem: • Heuristic methods such as gradient descent that only ﬁnd a local minimum. A drawback of this approach is the lack of theoretical guarantee showing that the local minimum gives a good solution. • Convex relaxation such as L1 -regularization that solves the problem under some conditions. However it often leads to a sub-optimal solution in reality. This paper tries to remedy the above gap between theory and practice. In particular, we present a multi-stage convex relaxation scheme for solving problems with non-convex objective functions. For learning formulations with sparse regularization, we analyze the behavior of a speciﬁc multistage relaxation scheme. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the local solution obtained by this procedure is superior to the global solution of the standard L1 convex relaxation for learning sparse targets.

<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Martin J. Wainwright, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Methods based on ℓ1 -relaxation, such as basis pursuit and the Lasso, are very popular for sparse regression in high dimensions. The conditions for success of these methods are now well-understood: (1) exact recovery in the noiseless setting is possible if and only if the design matrix X satisﬁes the restricted nullspace property, and (2) the squared ℓ2 -error of a Lasso estimate decays at the minimax optimal rate k log p , where k is the sparsity of the p-dimensional regression problem with additive n Gaussian noise, whenever the design satisﬁes a restricted eigenvalue condition. The key issue is thus to determine when the design matrix X satisﬁes these desirable properties. Thus far, there have been numerous results showing that the restricted isometry property, which implies both the restricted nullspace and eigenvalue conditions, is satisﬁed when all entries of X are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), or the rows are unitary. This paper proves directly that the restricted nullspace and eigenvalue conditions hold with high probability for quite general classes of Gaussian matrices for which the predictors may be highly dependent, and hence restricted isometry conditions can be violated with high probability. In this way, our results extend the attractive theoretical guarantees on ℓ1 -relaxations to a much broader class of problems than the case of completely independent or unitary designs.

<p>Author: Fei Ye, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider the estimation of regression coefﬁcients in a high-dimensional linear model. For regression coefﬁcients in ℓr balls, we provide lower bounds for the minimax ℓq risk and minimax quantiles of the ℓq loss for all design matrices. Under an ℓ0 sparsity condition on a target coefﬁcient vector, we sharpen and unify existing oracle inequalities for the Lasso and Dantzig selector. We derive oracle inequalities for target coefﬁcient vectors with many small elements and smaller threshold levels than the universal threshold. These oracle inequalities provide sufﬁcient conditions on the design matrix for the rate minimaxity of the Lasso and Dantzig selector for the ℓq risk and loss in ℓr balls, 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 ≤ q ≤ ∞. By allowing q = ∞, our risk bounds imply the variable selection consistency of threshold Lasso and Dantzig selectors.

<p>Author: Ming Yuan, Marten Wegkamp</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of binary classiﬁcation with a reject option in which one can withhold the decision of classifying an observation at a cost lower than that of misclassiﬁcation. Since the natural loss function is non-convex so that empirical risk minimization easily becomes infeasible, the paper proposes minimizing convex risks based on surrogate convex loss functions. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for inﬁnite sample consistency (both risks share the same minimizer) is provided. Moreover, we show that the excess risk can be bounded through the excess surrogate risk under appropriate conditions. These bounds can be tightened by a generalized margin condition. The impact of the results is illustrated on several commonly used surrogate loss functions.

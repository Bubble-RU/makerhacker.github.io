<p>Author: Kaname Kojima, Eric Perrier, Seiya Imoto, Satoru Miyano</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning an optimal Bayesian network in a constrained search space; skeletons are compelled to be subgraphs of a given undirected graph called the super-structure. The previously derived constrained optimal search (COS) remains limited even for sparse superstructures. To extend its feasibility, we propose to divide the super-structure into several clusters and perform an optimal search on each of them. Further, to ensure acyclicity, we introduce the concept of ancestral constraints (ACs) and derive an optimal algorithm satisfying a given set of ACs. Finally, we theoretically derive the necessary and sufﬁcient sets of ACs to be considered for ﬁnding an optimal constrained graph. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm can learn optimal Bayesian networks for some graphs containing several hundreds of vertices, and even for super-structures having a high average degree (up to four), which is a drastic improvement in feasibility over the previous optimal algorithm. Learnt networks are shown to largely outperform state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms both in terms of score and structural hamming distance.

<p>Author: Yevgeny Seldin, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: We derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for supervised and unsupervised learning models based on clustering, such as co-clustering, matrix tri-factorization, graphical models, graph clustering, and pairwise clustering.1 We begin with the analysis of co-clustering, which is a widely used approach to the analysis of data matrices. We distinguish among two tasks in matrix data analysis: discriminative prediction of the missing entries in data matrices and estimation of the joint probability distribution of row and column variables in co-occurrence matrices. We derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for the expected out-of-sample performance of co-clustering-based solutions for these two tasks. The analysis yields regularization terms that were absent in the previous formulations of co-clustering. The bounds suggest that the expected performance of co-clustering is governed by a trade-off between its empirical performance and the mutual information preserved by the cluster variables on row and column IDs. We derive an iterative projection algorithm for ﬁnding a local optimum of this trade-off for discriminative prediction tasks. This algorithm achieved stateof-the-art performance in the MovieLens collaborative ﬁltering task. Our co-clustering model can also be seen as matrix tri-factorization and the results provide generalization bounds, regularization terms, and new algorithms for this form of matrix factorization. The analysis of co-clustering is extended to tree-shaped graphical models, which can be used to analyze high dimensional tensors. According to the bounds, the generalization abilities of treeshaped graphical models depend on a trade-off between their empirical data ﬁt and the mutual information that is propagated up the tree levels. We also formulate weighted graph clustering as a prediction problem: given a subset of edge weights we analyze the ability of graph clustering to predict the remaining edge weights.

<p>Author: Dotan Di Castro, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-Critic based approaches were among the ﬁrst to address reinforcement learning in a general setting. Recently, these algorithms have gained renewed interest due to their generality, good convergence properties, and possible biological relevance. In this paper, we introduce an online temporal difference based actor-critic algorithm which is proved to converge to a neighborhood of a local maximum of the average reward. Linear function approximation is used by the critic in order estimate the value function, and the temporal difference signal, which is passed from the critic to the actor. The main distinguishing feature of the present convergence proof is that both the actor and the critic operate on a similar time scale, while in most current convergence proofs they are required to have very different time scales in order to converge. Moreover, the same temporal difference signal is used to update the parameters of both the actor and the critic. A limitation of the proposed approach, compared to results available for two time scale convergence, is that convergence is guaranteed only to a neighborhood of an optimal value, rather to an optimal value itself. The single time scale and identical temporal difference signal used by the actor and the critic, may provide a step towards constructing more biologically realistic models of reinforcement learning in the brain.

<p>Author: Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: We study losses for binary classiﬁcation and class probability estimation and extend the understanding of them from margin losses to general composite losses which are the composition of a proper loss with a link function. We characterise when margin losses can be proper composite losses, explicitly show how to determine a symmetric loss in full from half of one of its partial losses, introduce an intrinsic parametrisation of composite binary losses and give a complete characterisation of the relationship between proper losses and “classiﬁcation calibrated” losses. We also consider the question of the “best” surrogate binary loss. We introduce a precise notion of “best” and show there exist situations where two convex surrogate losses are incommensurable. We provide a complete explicit characterisation of the convexity of composite binary losses in terms of the link function and the weight function associated with the proper loss which make up the composite loss. This characterisation suggests new ways of “surrogate tuning” as well as providing an explicit characterisation of when Bregman divergences on the unit interval are convex in their second argument. Finally, in an appendix we present some new algorithm-independent results on the relationship between properness, convexity and robustness to misclassiﬁcation noise for binary losses and show that all convex proper losses are non-robust to misclassiﬁcation noise.

<p>Author: Gunnar Carlsson, Facundo Mémoli</p><p>Abstract: We study hierarchical clustering schemes under an axiomatic view. We show that within this framework, one can prove a theorem analogous to one of Kleinberg (2002), in which one obtains an existence and uniqueness theorem instead of a non-existence result. We explore further properties of this unique scheme: stability and convergence are established. We represent dendrograms as ultrametric spaces and use tools from metric geometry, namely the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, to quantify the degree to which perturbations in the input metric space affect the result of hierarchical methods.

<p>Author: Remco Bouckaert, Raymond Hemmecke, Silvia Lindner, Milan Studený</p><p>Abstract: The topic of the paper is computer testing of (probabilistic) conditional independence (CI) implications by an algebraic method of structural imsets. The basic idea is to transform (sets of) CI statements into certain integral vectors and to verify by a computer the corresponding algebraic relation between the vectors, called the independence implication. We interpret the previous methods for computer testing of this implication from the point of view of polyhedral geometry. However, the main contribution of the paper is a new method, based on linear programming (LP). The new method overcomes the limitation of former methods to the number of involved variables. We recall/describe the theoretical basis for all four methods involved in our computational experiments, whose aim was to compare the efﬁciency of the algorithms. The experiments show that the LP method is clearly the fastest one. As an example of possible application of such algorithms we show that testing inclusion of Bayesian network structures or whether a CI statement is encoded in an acyclic directed graph can be done by the algebraic method.

<p>Author: Jacek P. Dmochowski, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: The presence of asymmetry in the misclassiﬁcation costs or class prevalences is a common occurrence in the pattern classiﬁcation domain. While much interest has been devoted to the study of cost-sensitive learning techniques, the relationship between cost-sensitive learning and the speciﬁcation of the model set in a parametric estimation framework remains somewhat unclear. To that end, we differentiate between the case of the model including the true posterior, and that in which the model is misspeciﬁed. In the former case, it is shown that thresholding the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate is an asymptotically optimal solution to the risk minimization problem. On the other hand, under model misspeciﬁcation, it is demonstrated that thresholded ML is suboptimal and that the risk-minimizing solution varies with the misclassiﬁcation cost ratio. Moreover, we analytically show that the negative weighted log likelihood (Elkan, 2001) is a tight, convex upper bound of the empirical loss. Coupled with empirical results on several real-world data sets, we argue that weighted ML is the preferred cost-sensitive technique.

<p>Author: Lorenzo Rosasco, Mikhail Belkin, Ernesto De Vito</p><p>Abstract: A large number of learning algorithms, for example, spectral clustering, kernel Principal Components Analysis and many manifold methods are based on estimating eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of operators deﬁned by a similarity function or a kernel, given empirical data. Thus for the analysis of algorithms, it is an important problem to be able to assess the quality of such approximations. The contribution of our paper is two-fold: 1. We use a technique based on a concentration inequality for Hilbert spaces to provide new much simpliﬁed proofs for a number of results in spectral approximation. 2. Using these methods we provide several new results for estimating spectral properties of the graph Laplacian operator extending and strengthening results from von Luxburg et al. (2008).

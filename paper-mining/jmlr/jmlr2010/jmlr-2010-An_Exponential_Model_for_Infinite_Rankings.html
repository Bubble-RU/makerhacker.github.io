<p>Author: András György, Gábor Lugosi, György Ottucsàk</p><p>Abstract: We consider a sequential version of the classical bin packing problem in which items are received one by one. Before the size of the next item is revealed, the decision maker needs to decide whether the next item is packed in the currently open bin or the bin is closed and a new bin is opened. If the new item does not ﬁt, it is lost. If a bin is closed, the remaining free space in the bin accounts for a loss. The goal of the decision maker is to minimize the loss accumulated over n periods. We present an algorithm that has a cumulative loss not much larger than any strategy in a ﬁnite class of reference strategies for any sequence of items. Special attention is payed to reference strategies that use a ﬁxed threshold at each step to decide whether a new bin is opened. Some positive and negative results are presented for this case.

<p>Author: Jitkomut Songsiri, Lieven Vandenberghe</p><p>Abstract: An algorithm is presented for topology selection in graphical models of autoregressive Gaussian time series. The graph topology of the model represents the sparsity pattern of the inverse spectrum of the time series and characterizes conditional independence relations between the variables. The method proposed in the paper is based on an ℓ1 -type nonsmooth regularization of the conditional maximum likelihood estimation problem. We show that this reduces to a convex optimization problem and describe a large-scale algorithm that solves the dual problem via the gradient projection method.

<p>Author: Jacek P. Dmochowski, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: The presence of asymmetry in the misclassiﬁcation costs or class prevalences is a common occurrence in the pattern classiﬁcation domain. While much interest has been devoted to the study of cost-sensitive learning techniques, the relationship between cost-sensitive learning and the speciﬁcation of the model set in a parametric estimation framework remains somewhat unclear. To that end, we differentiate between the case of the model including the true posterior, and that in which the model is misspeciﬁed. In the former case, it is shown that thresholding the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate is an asymptotically optimal solution to the risk minimization problem. On the other hand, under model misspeciﬁcation, it is demonstrated that thresholded ML is suboptimal and that the risk-minimizing solution varies with the misclassiﬁcation cost ratio. Moreover, we analytically show that the negative weighted log likelihood (Elkan, 2001) is a tight, convex upper bound of the empirical loss. Coupled with empirical results on several real-world data sets, we argue that weighted ML is the preferred cost-sensitive technique.

<p>Author: Nguyen Xuan Vinh, Julien Epps, James Bailey</p><p>Abstract: Information theoretic measures form a fundamental class of measures for comparing clusterings, and have recently received increasing interest. Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning their properties and inter-relationships remain unresolved. In this paper, we perform an organized study of information theoretic measures for clustering comparison, including several existing popular measures in the literature, as well as some newly proposed ones. We discuss and prove their important properties, such as the metric property and the normalization property. We then highlight to the clustering community the importance of correcting information theoretic measures for chance, especially when the data size is small compared to the number of clusters present therein. Of the available information theoretic based measures, we advocate the normalized information distance (NID) as a general measure of choice, for it possesses concurrently several important properties, such as being both a metric and a normalized measure, admitting an exact analytical adjusted-for-chance form, and using the nominal [0, 1] range better than other normalized variants.

<p>Author: Liva Ralaivola, Marie Szafranski, Guillaume Stempfel</p><p>Abstract: PAC-Bayes bounds are among the most accurate generalization bounds for classiﬁers learned from independently and identically distributed (IID) data, and it is particularly so for margin classiﬁers: there have been recent contributions showing how practical these bounds can be either to perform model selection (Ambroladze et al., 2007) or even to directly guide the learning of linear classiﬁers (Germain et al., 2009). However, there are many practical situations where the training data show some dependencies and where the traditional IID assumption does not hold. Stating generalization bounds for such frameworks is therefore of the utmost interest, both from theoretical and practical standpoints. In this work, we propose the ﬁrst—to the best of our knowledge—PAC-Bayes generalization bounds for classiﬁers trained on data exhibiting interdependencies. The approach undertaken to establish our results is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency graph that encodes the dependencies within the data, in sets of independent data, thanks to graph fractional covers. Our bounds are very general, since being able to ﬁnd an upper bound on the fractional chromatic number of the dependency graph is sufﬁcient to get new PAC-Bayes bounds for speciﬁc settings. We show how our results can be used to derive bounds for ranking statistics (such as AUC) and classiﬁers trained on data distributed according to a stationary β-mixing process. In the way, we show how our approach seamlessly allows us to deal with U-processes. As a side note, we also provide a PAC-Bayes generalization bound for classiﬁers learned on data from stationary ϕ-mixing distributions.

<p>Author: Torsten Hothorn, Peter Bühlmann, Thomas Kneib, Matthias Schmid, Benjamin Hofner</p><p>Abstract: We describe version 2.0 of the R add-on package mboost. The package implements boosting for optimizing general risk functions using component-wise (penalized) least squares estimates or regression trees as base-learners for ﬁtting generalized linear, additive and interaction models to potentially high-dimensional data. Keywords: component-wise functional gradient descent, splines, decision trees 1. Overview The R add-on package mboost (Hothorn et al., 2010) implements tools for ﬁtting and evaluating a variety of regression and classiﬁcation models that have been suggested in machine learning and statistics. Optimization within the empirical risk minimization framework is performed via a component-wise functional gradient descent algorithm. The algorithm originates from the statistical view on boosting algorithms (Friedman et al., 2000; Bühlmann and Yu, 2003). The theory and its implementation in mboost allow for ﬁtting complex prediction models, taking potentially many interactions of features into account, as well as for ﬁtting additive and linear models. The model class the package deals with is best described by so-called structured additive regression (STAR) models, where some characteristic ξ of the conditional distribution of a response variable Y given features X is modeled through a regression function f of the features ξ(Y |X = x) = f (x). In order to facilitate parsimonious and interpretable models, the regression function f is structured, that is, restricted to additive functions f (x) = ∑ p f j (x). Each model component f j (x) might take only j=1 c 2010 Torsten Hothorn, Peter Bühlmann, Thomas Kneib, Matthias Schmid and Benjamin Hofner. H OTHORN , B ÜHLMANN , K NEIB , S CHMID AND H OFNER a subset of the features into account. Special cases are linear models f (x) = x⊤ β, additive models f (x) = ∑ p f j (x( j) ), where f j is a function of the jth feature x( j) only (smooth functions or j=1 stumps, for example) or a more complex function where f (x) is implicitly deﬁned as the sum of multiple decision trees including higher-order interactions. The latter case corresponds to boosting with trees. Combinations of these structures are also possible. The most important advantage of such a decomposition of the regression function is that each component of a ﬁtted model can be looked at and interpreted separately for gaining a better understanding of the model at hand. The characteristic ξ of the distribution depends on the measurement scale of the response Y and the scientiﬁc question to be answered. For binary or numeric variables, some function of the expectation may be appropriate, but also quantiles or expectiles may be interesting. The deﬁnition of ξ is determined by deﬁning a loss function ρ whose empirical risk is to be minimized under some algorithmic constraints (i.e., limited number of boosting iterations). The model is then ﬁtted using n p ( fˆ1 , . . . , fˆp ) = argmin ∑ wi ρ yi , ∑ f j (x) . ( f1 ,..., f p ) i=1 j=1 Here (yi , xi ), i = 1, . . . , n, are n training samples with responses yi and potentially high-dimensional feature vectors xi , and wi are some weights. The component-wise boosting algorithm starts with some offset for f and iteratively ﬁts residuals deﬁned by the negative gradient of the loss function evaluated at the current ﬁt by updating only the best model component in each iteration. The details have been described by Bühlmann and Yu (2003). Early stopping via resampling approaches or AIC leads to sparse models in the sense that only a subset of important model components f j deﬁnes the ﬁnal model. A more thorough introduction to boosting with applications in statistics based on version 1.0 of mboost is given by Bühlmann and Hothorn (2007). As of version 2.0, the package allows for ﬁtting models to binary, numeric, ordered and censored responses, that is, regression of the mean, robust regression, classiﬁcation (logistic and exponential loss), ordinal regression,1 quantile1 and expectile1 regression, censored regression (including Cox, Weibull1 , log-logistic1 or lognormal1 models) as well as Poisson and negative binomial regression1 for count data can be performed. Because the structure of the regression function f (x) can be chosen independently from the loss function ρ, interesting new models can be ﬁtted (e.g., in geoadditive regression, Kneib et al., 2009). 2. Design and Implementation The package incorporates an infrastructure for representing loss functions (so-called ‘families’), base-learners deﬁning the structure of the regression function and thus the model components f j , and a generic implementation of component-wise functional gradient descent. The main progress in version 2.0 is that only one implementation of the boosting algorithm is applied to all possible models (linear, additive, tree-based) and all families. Earlier versions were based on three implementations, one for linear models, one for additive models, and one for tree-based boosting. In comparison to the 1.0 series, the reduced code basis is easier to maintain, more robust and regression tests have been set-up in a more uniﬁed way. Speciﬁcally, the new code basis results in an enhanced and more user-friendly formula interface. In addition, convenience functions for hyperparameter selection, faster computation of predictions and improved visual model diagnostics are available. 1. Model family is new in version 2.0 or was added after the release of mboost 1.0. 2110 M ODEL - BASED B OOSTING 2.0 Currently implemented base-learners include component-wise linear models (where only one variable is updated in each iteration of the algorithm), additive models with quadratic penalties (e.g., for ﬁtting smooth functions via penalized splines, varying coefﬁcients or bi- and trivariate tensor product splines, Schmid and Hothorn, 2008), and trees. As a major improvement over the 1.0 series, computations on larger data sets (both with respect to the number of observations and the number of variables) are now facilitated by memory efﬁcient implementations of the base-learners, mostly by applying sparse matrix techniques (package Matrix, Bates and Mächler, 2009) and parallelization for a cross-validation-based choice of the number of boosting iterations (per default via package multicore, Urbanek, 2009). A more elaborate description of mboost 2.0 features is available from the mboost vignette.2 3. User Interface by Example We illustrate the main components of the user-interface by a small example on human body fat composition: Garcia et al. (2005) used a linear model for predicting body fat content by means of common anthropometric measurements that were obtained for n = 71 healthy German women. In addition, the women’s body composition was measured by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA). The aim is to describe the DXA measurements as a function of the anthropometric features. Here, we extend the linear model by i) an intrinsic variable selection via early stopping, ii) additional terms allowing for smooth deviations from linearity where necessary (by means of penalized splines orthogonalized to the linear effect, Kneib et al., 2009), iii) a possible interaction between two variables with known impact on body fat composition (hip and waist circumference) and iv) using a robust median regression approach instead of L2 risk. For the data (available as data frame bodyfat), the model structure is speciﬁed via a formula involving the base-learners corresponding to the different model components (linear terms: bols(); smooth terms: bbs(); interactions: btree()). The loss function (here, the check function for the 0.5 quantile) along with its negative gradient function are deﬁned by the QuantReg(0.5) family (Fenske et al., 2009). The model structure (speciﬁed using the formula fm), the data and the family are then passed to function mboost() for model ﬁtting:3 R> library(</p><p>3 0.70567781 <a title="10-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2010-Quadratic_Programming_Feature_Selection.html">94 jmlr-2010-Quadratic Programming Feature Selection</a></p>
<p>Author: Irene Rodriguez-Lujan, Ramon Huerta, Charles Elkan, Carlos Santa Cruz</p><p>Abstract: Identifying a subset of features that preserves classiﬁcation accuracy is a problem of growing importance, because of the increasing size and dimensionality of real-world data sets. We propose a new feature selection method, named Quadratic Programming Feature Selection (QPFS), that reduces the task to a quadratic optimization problem. In order to limit the computational complexity of solving the optimization problem, QPFS uses the Nystr¨ m method for approximate matrix diago onalization. QPFS is thus capable of dealing with very large data sets, for which the use of other methods is computationally expensive. In experiments with small and medium data sets, the QPFS method leads to classiﬁcation accuracy similar to that of other successful techniques. For large data sets, QPFS is superior in terms of computational efﬁciency.

<p>Author: Marina Meilă, Le Bao</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a statistical model for expressing preferences through rankings, when the number of alternatives (items to rank) is large. A human ranker will then typically rank only the most preferred items, and may not even examine the whole set of items, or know how many they are. Similarly, a user presented with the ranked output of a search engine, will only consider the highest ranked items. We model such situations by introducing a stagewise ranking model that operates with ﬁnite ordered lists called top-t orderings over an inﬁnite space of items. We give algorithms to estimate this model from data, and demonstrate that it has sufﬁcient statistics, being thus an exponential family model with continuous and discrete parameters. We describe its conjugate prior and other statistical properties. Then, we extend the estimation problem to multimodal data by introducing an Exponential-Blurring-Mean-Shift nonparametric clustering algorithm. The experiments highlight the properties of our model and demonstrate that inﬁnite models over permutations can be simple, elegant and practical.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

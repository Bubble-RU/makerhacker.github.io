<p>Author: Gavin C. Cawley, Nicola L. C. Talbot</p><p>Abstract: Model selection strategies for machine learning algorithms typically involve the numerical optimisation of an appropriate model selection criterion, often based on an estimator of generalisation performance, such as k-fold cross-validation. The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneﬁcial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a nonnegligible variance introduces the potential for over-ﬁtting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-ﬁtting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-ﬁtting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-ﬁtting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-ﬁtting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the ﬁndings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a ﬁnite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds.

<p>Author: Jacek P. Dmochowski, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: The presence of asymmetry in the misclassiﬁcation costs or class prevalences is a common occurrence in the pattern classiﬁcation domain. While much interest has been devoted to the study of cost-sensitive learning techniques, the relationship between cost-sensitive learning and the speciﬁcation of the model set in a parametric estimation framework remains somewhat unclear. To that end, we differentiate between the case of the model including the true posterior, and that in which the model is misspeciﬁed. In the former case, it is shown that thresholding the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate is an asymptotically optimal solution to the risk minimization problem. On the other hand, under model misspeciﬁcation, it is demonstrated that thresholded ML is suboptimal and that the risk-minimizing solution varies with the misclassiﬁcation cost ratio. Moreover, we analytically show that the negative weighted log likelihood (Elkan, 2001) is a tight, convex upper bound of the empirical loss. Coupled with empirical results on several real-world data sets, we argue that weighted ML is the preferred cost-sensitive technique.

<p>Author: Constantin F. Aliferis, Alexander Statnikov, Ioannis Tsamardinos, Subramani Mani, Xenofon D. Koutsoukos</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithmic framework for learning local causal structure around target variables of interest in the form of direct causes/effects and Markov blankets applicable to very large data sets with relatively small samples. The selected feature sets can be used for causal discovery and classiÄ?Ĺš cation. The framework (Generalized Local Learning, or GLL) can be instantiated in numerous ways, giving rise to both existing state-of-the-art as well as novel algorithms. The resulting algorithms are sound under well-deÄ?Ĺš ned sufÄ?Ĺš cient conditions. In a Ä?Ĺš rst set of experiments we evaluate several algorithms derived from this framework in terms of predictivity and feature set parsimony and compare to other local causal discovery methods and to state-of-the-art non-causal feature selection methods using real data. A second set of experimental evaluations compares the algorithms in terms of ability to induce local causal neighborhoods using simulated and resimulated data and examines the relation of predictivity with causal induction performance. Our experiments demonstrate, consistently with causal feature selection theory, that local causal feature selection methods (under broad assumptions encompassing appropriate family of distribuc 2010 Constantin F. Aliferis, Alexander Statnikov, Ioannis Tsamardinos, Subramani Mani and Xenofon D. Koutsoukos. A LIFERIS , S TATNIKOV, T SAMARDINOS , M ANI AND KOUTSOUKOS tions, types of classiÄ?Ĺš ers, and loss functions) exhibit strong feature set parsimony, high predictivity and local causal interpretability. Although non-causal feature selection methods are often used in practice to shed light on causal relationships, we Ä?Ĺš nd that they cannot be interpreted causally even when they achieve excellent predictivity. Therefore we conclude that only local causal techniques should be used when insight into causal structure is sought.

<p>Author: Shyam Visweswaran, Gregory F. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian algorithm for constructing predictive models from data that are optimized to predict a target variable well for a particular instance. This algorithm learns Markov blanket models, carries out Bayesian model averaging over a set of models to predict a target variable of the instance at hand, and employs an instance-speciﬁc heuristic to locate a set of suitable models to average over. We call this method the instance-speciﬁc Markov blanket (ISMB) algorithm. The ISMB algorithm was evaluated on 21 UCI data sets using ﬁve different performance measures and its performance was compared to that of several commonly used predictive algorithms, including nave Bayes, C4.5 decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks, k-Nearest Neighbor, Lazy Bayesian Rules, and AdaBoost. Over all the data sets, the ISMB algorithm performed better on average on all performance measures against all the comparison algorithms.

<p>Author: Evangelos Theodorou, Jonas Buchli, Stefan Schaal</p><p>Abstract: With the goal to generate more scalable algorithms with higher efﬁciency and fewer open parameters, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently moved towards combining classical techniques from optimal control and dynamic programming with modern learning techniques from statistical estimation theory. In this vein, this paper suggests to use the framework of stochastic optimal control with path integrals to derive a novel approach to RL with parameterized policies. While solidly grounded in value function estimation and optimal control based on the stochastic Hamilton-JacobiBellman (HJB) equations, policy improvements can be transformed into an approximation problem of a path integral which has no open algorithmic parameters other than the exploration noise. The resulting algorithm can be conceived of as model-based, semi-model-based, or even model free, depending on how the learning problem is structured. The update equations have no danger of numerical instabilities as neither matrix inversions nor gradient learning rates are required. Our new algorithm demonstrates interesting similarities with previous RL research in the framework of probability matching and provides intuition why the slightly heuristically motivated probability matching approach can actually perform well. Empirical evaluations demonstrate signiﬁcant performance improvements over gradient-based policy learning and scalability to high-dimensional control problems. Finally, a learning experiment on a simulated 12 degree-of-freedom robot dog illustrates the functionality of our algorithm in a complex robot learning scenario. We believe that Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2 ) offers currently one of the most efﬁcient, numerically robust, and easy to implement algorithms for RL based on trajectory roll-outs.

<p>Author: Isabelle Guyon, Amir Saffari, Gideon Dror, Gavin Cawley</p><p>Abstract: The principle of parsimony also known as “Ockham’s razor” has inspired many theories of model selection. Yet such theories, all making arguments in favor of parsimony, are based on very different premises and have developed distinct methodologies to derive algorithms. We have organized challenges and edited a special issue of JMLR and several conference proceedings around the theme of model selection. In this editorial, we revisit the problem of avoiding overﬁtting in light of the latest results. We note the remarkable convergence of theories as different as Bayesian theory, Minimum Description Length, bias/variance tradeoff, Structural Risk Minimization, and regularization, in some approaches. We also present new and interesting examples of the complementarity of theories leading to hybrid algorithms, neither frequentist, nor Bayesian, or perhaps both frequentist and Bayesian!

<p>Author: Phillip Verbancsics, Kenneth O. Stanley</p><p>Abstract: An important goal for machine learning is to transfer knowledge between tasks. For example, learning to play RoboCup Keepaway should contribute to learning the full game of RoboCup soccer. Previous approaches to transfer in Keepaway have focused on transforming the original representation to ﬁt the new task. In contrast, this paper explores the idea that transfer is most effective if the representation is designed to be the same even across different tasks. To demonstrate this point, a bird’s eye view (BEV) representation is introduced that can represent different tasks on the same two-dimensional map. For example, both the 3 vs. 2 and 4 vs. 3 Keepaway tasks can be represented on the same BEV. Yet the problem is that a raw two-dimensional map is high-dimensional and unstructured. This paper shows how this problem is addressed naturally by an idea from evolutionary computation called indirect encoding, which compresses the representation by exploiting its geometry. The result is that the BEV learns a Keepaway policy that transfers without further learning or manipulation. It also facilitates transferring knowledge learned in a different domain, Knight Joust, into Keepaway. Finally, the indirect encoding of the BEV means that its geometry can be changed without altering the solution. Thus static representations facilitate several kinds of transfer.</p><p>4 0.43754604 <a title="78-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2010-On_the_Foundations_of_Noise-free_Selective_Classification.html">85 jmlr-2010-On the Foundations of Noise-free Selective Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ran El-Yaniv, Yair Wiener</p><p>Abstract: We consider selective classiﬁcation, a term we adopt here to refer to ‘classiﬁcation with a reject option.’ The essence in selective classiﬁcation is to trade-off classiﬁer coverage for higher accuracy. We term this trade-off the risk-coverage (RC) trade-off. Our main objective is to characterize this trade-off and to construct algorithms that can optimally or near optimally achieve the best possible trade-offs in a controlled manner. For noise-free models we present in this paper a thorough analysis of selective classiﬁcation including characterizations of RC trade-offs in various interesting settings.

<p>Author: Andreas Krause</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, a fundamental problem structure has emerged as very useful in a variety of machine learning applications: Submodularity is an intuitive diminishing returns property, stating that adding an element to a smaller set helps more than adding it to a larger set. Similarly to convexity, submodularity allows one to efﬁciently ﬁnd provably (near-) optimal solutions for large problems. We present SFO, a toolbox for use in MATLAB or Octave that implements algorithms for minimization and maximization of submodular functions. A tutorial script illustrates the application of submodularity to machine learning and AI problems such as feature selection, clustering, inference and optimized information gathering.</p><p>6 0.43402058 <a title="78-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2010-Learning_Non-Stationary_Dynamic_Bayesian_Networks.html">64 jmlr-2010-Learning Non-Stationary Dynamic Bayesian Networks</a></p>

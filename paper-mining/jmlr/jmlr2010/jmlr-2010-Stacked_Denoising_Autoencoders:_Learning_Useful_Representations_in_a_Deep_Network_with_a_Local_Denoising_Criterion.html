<p>Author: Dumitru Erhan, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, Pierre-Antoine Manzagol, Pascal Vincent, Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Much recent research has been devoted to learning algorithms for deep architectures such as Deep Belief Networks and stacks of auto-encoder variants, with impressive results obtained in several areas, mostly on vision and language data sets. The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this difﬁcult learning problem. The main question investigated here is the following: how does unsupervised pre-training work? Answering this questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We propose several explanatory hypotheses and test them through extensive simulations. We empirically show the inﬂuence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples. The experiments conﬁrm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. The results suggest that unsupervised pretraining guides the learning towards basins of attraction of minima that support better generalization from the training data set; the evidence from these results supports a regularization explanation for the effect of pre-training.

<p>Author: Valero Laparra, Juan Gutiérrez, Gustavo Camps-Valls, Jesús Malo</p><p>Abstract: A successful class of image denoising methods is based on Bayesian approaches working in wavelet representations. The performance of these methods improves when relations among the local frequency coefﬁcients are explicitly included. However, in these techniques, analytical estimates can be obtained only for particular combinations of analytical models of signal and noise, thus precluding its straightforward extension to deal with other arbitrary noise sources. In this paper, we propose an alternative non-explicit way to take into account the relations among natural image wavelet coefﬁcients for denoising: we use support vector regression (SVR) in the wavelet domain to enforce these relations in the estimated signal. Since relations among the coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to the signal, the regularization property of SVR is exploited to remove the noise, which does not share this feature. The speciﬁc signal relations are encoded in an anisotropic kernel obtained from mutual information measures computed on a representative image database. In the proposed scheme, training considers minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the estimated and actual probability functions (or histograms) of signal and noise in order to enforce similarity up to the higher (computationally estimable) order. Due to its non-parametric nature, the method can eventually cope with different noise sources without the need of an explicit re-formulation, as it is strictly necessary under parametric Bayesian formalisms. Results under several noise levels and noise sources show that: (1) the proposed method outperforms conventional wavelet methods that assume coefﬁcient independence, (2) it is similar to state-of-the-art methods that do explicitly include these relations when the noise source is Gaussian, and (3) it gives better numerical and visual performance when more complex, realistic noise sources are considered. Therefore, the proposed machine learning approach can be seen as a mor</p><p>4 0.043902997 <a title="107-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2010-Training_and_Testing_Low-degree_Polynomial_Data_Mappings_via_Linear_SVM.html">112 jmlr-2010-Training and Testing Low-degree Polynomial Data Mappings via Linear SVM</a></p>
<p>Author: Yin-Wen Chang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Kai-Wei Chang, Michael Ringgaard, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Kernel techniques have long been used in SVM to handle linearly inseparable problems by transforming data to a high dimensional space, but training and testing large data sets is often time consuming. In contrast, we can efﬁciently train and test much larger data sets using linear SVM without kernels. In this work, we apply fast linear-SVM methods to the explicit form of polynomially mapped data and investigate implementation issues. The approach enjoys fast training and testing, but may sometimes achieve accuracy close to that of using highly nonlinear kernels. Empirical experiments show that the proposed method is useful for certain large-scale data sets. We successfully apply the proposed method to a natural language processing (NLP) application by improving the testing accuracy under some training/testing speed requirements.

<p>Author: Pascal Vincent, Hugo Larochelle, Isabelle Lajoie, Yoshua Bengio, Pierre-Antoine Manzagol</p><p>Abstract: We explore an original strategy for building deep networks, based on stacking layers of denoising autoencoders which are trained locally to denoise corrupted versions of their inputs. The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classiﬁcation problems to yield signiﬁcantly lower classiﬁcation error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classiﬁers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations.

<p>Author: Fang-Lan Huang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Kai-Wei Chang, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Maximum entropy (Maxent) is useful in natural language processing and many other areas. Iterative scaling (IS) methods are one of the most popular approaches to solve Maxent. With many variants of IS methods, it is difﬁcult to understand them and see the differences. In this paper, we create a general and uniﬁed framework for iterative scaling methods. This framework also connects iterative scaling and coordinate descent methods. We prove general convergence results for IS methods and analyze their computational complexity. Based on the proposed framework, we extend a coordinate descent method for linear SVM to Maxent. Results show that it is faster than existing iterative scaling methods.

<p>Author: Dumitru Erhan, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, Pierre-Antoine Manzagol, Pascal Vincent, Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Much recent research has been devoted to learning algorithms for deep architectures such as Deep Belief Networks and stacks of auto-encoder variants, with impressive results obtained in several areas, mostly on vision and language data sets. The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this difﬁcult learning problem. The main question investigated here is the following: how does unsupervised pre-training work? Answering this questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We propose several explanatory hypotheses and test them through extensive simulations. We empirically show the inﬂuence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples. The experiments conﬁrm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. The results suggest that unsupervised pretraining guides the learning towards basins of attraction of minima that support better generalization from the training data set; the evidence from these results supports a regularization explanation for the effect of pre-training.

<p>Author: Gideon S. Mann, Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an overview of generalized expectation criteria (GE), a simple, robust, scalable method for semi-supervised training using weakly-labeled data. GE ﬁts model parameters by favoring models that match certain expectation constraints, such as marginal label distributions, on the unlabeled data. This paper shows how to apply generalized expectation criteria to two classes of parametric models: maximum entropy models and conditional random ﬁelds. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements over supervised training and a number of other stateof-the-art semi-supervised learning methods for these models.

<p>Author: Pannagadatta K. Shivaswamy, Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: Leading classiﬁcation methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) and their counterparts achieve strong generalization performance by maximizing the margin of separation between data classes. While the maximum margin approach has achieved promising performance, this article identiﬁes its sensitivity to afﬁne transformations of the data and to directions with large data spread. Maximum margin solutions may be misled by the spread of data and preferentially separate classes along large spread directions. This article corrects these weaknesses by measuring margin not in the absolute sense but rather only relative to the spread of data in any projection direction. Maximum relative margin corresponds to a data-dependent regularization on the classiﬁcation function while maximum absolute margin corresponds to an ℓ2 norm constraint on the classiﬁcation function. Interestingly, the proposed improvements only require simple extensions to existing maximum margin formulations and preserve the computational efﬁciency of SVMs. Through the maximization of relative margin, surprising performance gains are achieved on real-world problems such as digit, text classiﬁcation and on several other benchmark data sets. In addition, risk bounds are derived for the new formulation based on Rademacher averages.

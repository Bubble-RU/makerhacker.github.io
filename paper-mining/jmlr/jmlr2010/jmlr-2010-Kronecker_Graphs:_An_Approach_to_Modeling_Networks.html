<p>Author: S.V.N. Vishwanathan, Nicol N. Schraudolph, Risi Kondor, Karsten M. Borgwardt</p><p>Abstract: We present a uniﬁed framework to study graph kernels, special cases of which include the random a walk (G¨ rtner et al., 2003; Borgwardt et al., 2005) and marginalized (Kashima et al., 2003, 2004; Mah´ et al., 2004) graph kernels. Through reduction to a Sylvester equation we improve the time e complexity of kernel computation between unlabeled graphs with n vertices from O(n6 ) to O(n3 ). We ﬁnd a spectral decomposition approach even more efﬁcient when computing entire kernel matrices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and ﬁxed-point methods that take O(dn3 ) time per iteration, where d is the size of the label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge kernels, and O(n4 ) in the inﬁnite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs these algorithms only take O(n2 ) time per iteration in all cases. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that these techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of magnitude or more. We also show that certain rational kernels (Cortes et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) when specialized to graphs reduce to our random walk graph kernel. Finally, we relate our framework to R-convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999) and provide a kernel that is close to the optimal assignment o kernel of Fr¨ hlich et al.

<p>Author: Pedro A. Forero, Alfonso Cano, Georgios B. Giannakis</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops algorithms to train support vector machines when training data are distributed across different nodes, and their communication to a centralized processing unit is prohibited due to, for example, communication complexity, scalability, or privacy reasons. To accomplish this goal, the centralized linear SVM problem is cast as a set of decentralized convex optimization subproblems (one per node) with consensus constraints on the wanted classiﬁer parameters. Using the alternating direction method of multipliers, fully distributed training algorithms are obtained without exchanging training data among nodes. Different from existing incremental approaches, the overhead associated with inter-node communications is ﬁxed and solely dependent on the network topology rather than the size of the training sets available per node. Important generalizations to train nonlinear SVMs in a distributed fashion are also developed along with sequential variants capable of online processing. Simulated tests illustrate the performance of the novel algorithms.1 Keywords: support vector machine, distributed optimization, distributed data mining, distributed learning, sensor networks</p><p>4 0.080358088 <a title="58-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2010-Learning_Non-Stationary_Dynamic_Bayesian_Networks.html">64 jmlr-2010-Learning Non-Stationary Dynamic Bayesian Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Joshua W. Robinson, Alexander J. Hartemink</p><p>Abstract: Learning dynamic Bayesian network structures provides a principled mechanism for identifying conditional dependencies in time-series data. An important assumption of traditional DBN structure learning is that the data are generated by a stationary process, an assumption that is not true in many important settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of graphical model called a nonstationary dynamic Bayesian network, in which the conditional dependence structure of the underlying data-generation process is permitted to change over time. Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks represent a new framework for studying problems in which the structure of a network is evolving over time. Some examples of evolving networks are transcriptional regulatory networks during an organism’s development, neural pathways during learning, and trafﬁc patterns during the day. We deﬁne the non-stationary DBN model, present an MCMC sampling algorithm for learning the structure of the model from time-series data under different assumptions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on both simulated and biological data.

<p>Author: Fabian Sinz, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new family of probability densities called L p -nested symmetric distributions. The common property, shared by all members of the new class, is the same functional form ˜ x x ρ(x ) = ρ( f (x )), where f is a nested cascade of L p -norms x p = (∑ |xi | p )1/p . L p -nested symmetric distributions thereby are a special case of ν-spherical distributions for which f is only required to be positively homogeneous of degree one. While both, ν-spherical and L p -nested symmetric distributions, contain many widely used families of probability models such as the Gaussian, spherically and elliptically symmetric distributions, L p -spherically symmetric distributions, and certain types of independent component analysis (ICA) and independent subspace analysis (ISA) models, ν-spherical distributions are usually computationally intractable. Here we demonstrate that L p nested symmetric distributions are still computationally feasible by deriving an analytic expression for its normalization constant, gradients for maximum likelihood estimation, analytic expressions for certain types of marginals, as well as an exact and efﬁcient sampling algorithm. We discuss the tight links of L p -nested symmetric distributions to well known machine learning methods such as ICA, ISA and mixed norm regularizers, and introduce the nested radial factorization algorithm (NRF), which is a form of non-linear ICA that transforms any linearly mixed, non-factorial L p nested symmetric source into statistically independent signals. As a corollary, we also introduce the uniform distribution on the L p -nested unit sphere.

<p>Author: Vicenç Gómez, Hilbert J. Kappen, Michael Chertkov</p><p>Abstract: We introduce novel results for approximate inference on planar graphical models using the loop calculus framework. The loop calculus (Chertkov and Chernyak, 2006a) allows to express the exact partition function of a graphical model as a ﬁnite sum of terms that can be evaluated once the belief propagation (BP) solution is known. In general, full summation over all correction terms is intractable. We develop an algorithm for the approach presented in Chertkov et al. (2008) which represents an efﬁcient truncation scheme on planar graphs and a new representation of the series in terms of Pfafﬁans of matrices. We analyze the performance of the algorithm for models with binary variables and pairwise interactions on grids and other planar graphs. We study in detail both the loop series and the equivalent Pfafﬁan series and show that the ﬁrst term of the Pfafﬁan series for the general, intractable planar model, can provide very accurate approximations. The algorithm outperforms previous truncation schemes of the loop series and is competitive with other state of the art methods for approximate inference.

<p>Author: Gérard Biau, Frédéric Cérou, Arnaud Guyader</p><p>Abstract: Bagging is a simple way to combine estimates in order to improve their performance. This method, suggested by Breiman in 1996, proceeds by resampling from the original data set, constructing a predictor from each subsample, and decide by combining. By bagging an n-sample, the crude nearest neighbor regression estimate is turned into a consistent weighted nearest neighbor regression estimate, which is amenable to statistical analysis. Letting the resampling size kn grows appropriately with n, it is shown that this estimate may achieve optimal rate of convergence, independently from the fact that resampling is done with or without replacement. Since the estimate with the optimal rate of convergence depends on the unknown distribution of the observations, adaptation results by data-splitting are presented.

<p>Author: Yu Fan, Jing Xu, Christian R. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: A continuous time Bayesian network (CTBN) uses a structured representation to describe a dynamic system with a ﬁnite number of states which evolves in continuous time. Exact inference in a CTBN is often intractable as the state space of the dynamic system grows exponentially with the number of variables. In this paper, we ﬁrst present an approximate inference algorithm based on importance sampling. We then extend it to continuous-time particle ﬁltering and smoothing algorithms. These three algorithms can estimate the expectation of any function of a trajectory, conditioned on any evidence set constraining the values of subsets of the variables over subsets of the time line. We present experimental results on both synthetic networks and a network learned from a real data set on people’s life history events. We show the accuracy as well as the time efﬁciency of our algorithms, and compare them to other approximate algorithms: expectation propagation and Gibbs sampling.

<p>Author: Jure Leskovec, Deepayan Chakrabarti, Jon Kleinberg, Christos Faloutsos, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: How can we generate realistic networks? In addition, how can we do so with a mathematically tractable model that allows for rigorous analysis of network properties? Real networks exhibit a long list of surprising properties: Heavy tails for the in- and out-degree distribution, heavy tails for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, small diameters, and densiﬁcation and shrinking diameters over time. Current network models and generators either fail to match several of the above properties, are complicated to analyze mathematically, or both. Here we propose a generative model for networks that is both mathematically tractable and can generate networks that have all the above mentioned structural properties. Our main idea here is to use a non-standard matrix operation, the Kronecker product, to generate graphs which we refer to as “Kronecker graphs”. First, we show that Kronecker graphs naturally obey common network properties. In fact, we rigorously prove that they do so. We also provide empirical evidence showing that Kronecker graphs can effectively model the structure of real networks. We then present K RON F IT, a fast and scalable algorithm for ﬁtting the Kronecker graph generation model to large real networks. A naive approach to ﬁtting would take super-exponential time. In contrast, K RON F IT takes linear time, by exploiting the structure of Kronecker matrix multiplication and by using statistical simulation techniques. Experiments on a wide range of large real and synthetic networks show that K RON F IT ﬁnds accurate parameters that very well mimic the properties of target networks.

<p>Author: Ido Cohn, Tal El-Hay, Nir Friedman, Raz Kupferman</p><p>Abstract: Continuous-time Bayesian networks is a natural structured representation language for multicomponent stochastic processes that evolve continuously over time. Despite the compact representation provided by this language, inference in such models is intractable even in relatively simple structured networks. We introduce a mean ﬁeld variational approximation in which we use a product of inhomogeneous Markov processes to approximate a joint distribution over trajectories. This variational approach leads to a globally consistent distribution, which can be efﬁciently queried. Additionally, it provides a lower bound on the probability of observations, thus making it attractive for learning tasks. Here we describe the theoretical foundations for the approximation, an efﬁcient implementation that exploits the wide range of highly optimized ordinary differential equations (ODE) solvers, experimentally explore characterizations of processes for which this approximation is suitable, and show applications to a large-scale real-world inference problem.

<p>Author: Christian R. Shelton, Yu Fan, William Lam, Joon Lee, Jing Xu</p><p>Abstract: We present a continuous time Bayesian network reasoning and learning engine (CTBN-RLE). A continuous time Bayesian network (CTBN) provides a compact (factored) description of a continuoustime Markov process. This software provides libraries and programs for most of the algorithms developed for CTBNs. For learning, CTBN-RLE implements structure and parameter learning for both complete and partial data. For inference, it implements exact inference and Gibbs and importance sampling approximate inference for any type of evidence pattern. Additionally, the library supplies visualization methods for graphically displaying CTBNs or trajectories of evidence.

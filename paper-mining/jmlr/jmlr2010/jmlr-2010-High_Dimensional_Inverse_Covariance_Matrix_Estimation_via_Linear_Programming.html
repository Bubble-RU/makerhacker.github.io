<p>Author: Fei Ye, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider the estimation of regression coefﬁcients in a high-dimensional linear model. For regression coefﬁcients in ℓr balls, we provide lower bounds for the minimax ℓq risk and minimax quantiles of the ℓq loss for all design matrices. Under an ℓ0 sparsity condition on a target coefﬁcient vector, we sharpen and unify existing oracle inequalities for the Lasso and Dantzig selector. We derive oracle inequalities for target coefﬁcient vectors with many small elements and smaller threshold levels than the universal threshold. These oracle inequalities provide sufﬁcient conditions on the design matrix for the rate minimaxity of the Lasso and Dantzig selector for the ℓq risk and loss in ℓr balls, 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 ≤ q ≤ ∞. By allowing q = ∞, our risk bounds imply the variable selection consistency of threshold Lasso and Dantzig selectors.

<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Martin J. Wainwright, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Methods based on ℓ1 -relaxation, such as basis pursuit and the Lasso, are very popular for sparse regression in high dimensions. The conditions for success of these methods are now well-understood: (1) exact recovery in the noiseless setting is possible if and only if the design matrix X satisﬁes the restricted nullspace property, and (2) the squared ℓ2 -error of a Lasso estimate decays at the minimax optimal rate k log p , where k is the sparsity of the p-dimensional regression problem with additive n Gaussian noise, whenever the design satisﬁes a restricted eigenvalue condition. The key issue is thus to determine when the design matrix X satisﬁes these desirable properties. Thus far, there have been numerous results showing that the restricted isometry property, which implies both the restricted nullspace and eigenvalue conditions, is satisﬁed when all entries of X are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), or the rows are unitary. This paper proves directly that the restricted nullspace and eigenvalue conditions hold with high probability for quite general classes of Gaussian matrices for which the predictors may be highly dependent, and hence restricted isometry conditions can be violated with high probability. In this way, our results extend the attractive theoretical guarantees on ℓ1 -relaxations to a much broader class of problems than the case of completely independent or unitary designs.

<p>Author: Dapo Omidiran, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of high-dimensional variable selection: given n noisy observations of a k-sparse vector β∗ ∈ R p , estimate the subset of non-zero entries of β∗ . A signiﬁcant body of work has studied behavior of ℓ1 -relaxations when applied to random measurement matrices that are dense (e.g., Gaussian, Bernoulli). In this paper, we analyze sparsiﬁed measurement ensembles, and consider the trade-off between measurement sparsity, as measured by the fraction γ of nonzero entries, and the statistical efﬁciency, as measured by the minimal number of observations n required for correct variable selection with probability converging to one. Our main result is to prove that it is possible to let the fraction on non-zero entries γ → 0 at some rate, yielding measurement matrices with a vanishing fraction of non-zeros per row, while retaining the same statistical efﬁciency as dense ensembles. A variety of simulation results conﬁrm the sharpness of our theoretical predictions.

<p>Author: Jitkomut Songsiri, Lieven Vandenberghe</p><p>Abstract: An algorithm is presented for topology selection in graphical models of autoregressive Gaussian time series. The graph topology of the model represents the sparsity pattern of the inverse spectrum of the time series and characterizes conditional independence relations between the variables. The method proposed in the paper is based on an ℓ1 -type nonsmooth regularization of the conditional maximum likelihood estimation problem. We show that this reduces to a convex optimization problem and describe a large-scale algorithm that solves the dual problem via the gradient projection method. Results of experiments with randomly generated and real data sets are also included.

The problem arises in a variety of applications, from collaborative ﬁltering (the ‘Netﬂix problem’) to structure-from-motion and positioning. We study a low complexity algorithm introduced by Keshavan, Montanari, and Oh (2010), based on a combination of spectral techniques and manifold optimization, that we call here O PT S PACE. We prove performance guarantees that are order-optimal in a number of circumstances.

<p>Author: Yin-Wen Chang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Kai-Wei Chang, Michael Ringgaard, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Kernel techniques have long been used in SVM to handle linearly inseparable problems by transforming data to a high dimensional space, but training and testing large data sets is often time consuming. In contrast, we can efﬁciently train and test much larger data sets using linear SVM without kernels. In this work, we apply fast linear-SVM methods to the explicit form of polynomially mapped data and investigate implementation issues. The approach enjoys fast training and testing, but may sometimes achieve accuracy close to that of using highly nonlinear kernels. Empirical experiments show that the proposed method is useful for certain large-scale data sets. We successfully apply the proposed method to a natural language processing (NLP) application by improving the testing accuracy under some training/testing speed requirements.

<p>Author: Jörg Lücke, Julian Eggert</p><p>Abstract: We show how a preselection of hidden variables can be used to efﬁciently train generative models with binary hidden variables. The approach is based on Expectation Maximization (EM) and uses an efﬁciently computable approximation to the sufﬁcient statistics of a given model. The computational cost to compute the sufﬁcient statistics is strongly reduced by selecting, for each data point, the relevant hidden causes. The approximation is applicable to a wide range of generative models and provides an interpretation of the beneﬁts of preselection in terms of a variational EM approximation. To empirically show that the method maximizes the data likelihood, it is applied to different types of generative models including: a version of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), a model for non-linear component extraction (MCA), and a linear generative model similar to sparse coding. The derived algorithms are applied to both artiﬁcial and realistic data, and are compared to other models in the literature. We ﬁnd that the training scheme can reduce computational costs by orders of magnitude and allows for a reliable extraction of hidden causes.

<p>Author: Franz Pernkopf, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a simple order-based greedy heuristic for learning discriminative structure within generative Bayesian network classiﬁers. We propose two methods for establishing an order of N features. They are based on the conditional mutual information and classiﬁcation rate (i.e., risk), respectively. Given an ordering, we can ﬁnd a discriminative structure with O N k+1 score evaluations (where constant k is the tree-width of the sub-graph over the attributes). We present results on 25 data sets from the UCI repository, for phonetic classiﬁcation using the TIMIT database, for a visual surface inspection task, and for two handwritten digit recognition tasks. We provide classiﬁcation performance for both discriminative and generative parameter learning on both discriminatively and generatively structured networks. The discriminative structure found by our new procedures signiﬁcantly outperforms generatively produced structures, and achieves a classiﬁcation accuracy on par with the best discriminative (greedy) Bayesian network learning approach, but does so with a factor of ∼10-40 speedup. We also show that the advantages of generative discriminatively structured Bayesian network classiﬁers still hold in the case of missing features, a case where generative classiﬁers have an advantage over discriminative classiﬁers.

<p>Author: Patrick O. Perry, Art B. Owen</p><p>Abstract: In multivariate regression models we have the opportunity to look for hidden structure unrelated to the observed predictors. However, when one ﬁts a model involving such latent variables it is important to be able to tell if the structure is real, or just an artifact of correlation in the regression errors. We develop a new statistical test based on random rotations for verifying the existence of latent variables. The rotations are carefully constructed to rotate orthogonally to the column space of the regression model. We ﬁnd that only non-Gaussian latent variables are detectable, a ﬁnding that parallels a well known phenomenon in independent components analysis. We base our test on a measure of non-Gaussianity in the histogram of the principal eigenvector components instead of on the eigenvalue. The method ﬁnds and veriﬁes some latent dichotomies in the microarray data from the AGEMAP consortium.

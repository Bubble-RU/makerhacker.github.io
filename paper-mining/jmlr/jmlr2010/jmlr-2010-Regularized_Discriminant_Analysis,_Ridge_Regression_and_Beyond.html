<p>Author: András György, Gábor Lugosi, György Ottucsàk</p><p>Abstract: We consider a sequential version of the classical bin packing problem in which items are received one by one. Before the size of the next item is revealed, the decision maker needs to decide whether the next item is packed in the currently open bin or the bin is closed and a new bin is opened. If the new item does not ﬁt, it is lost. If a bin is closed, the remaining free space in the bin accounts for a loss. The goal of the decision maker is to minimize the loss accumulated over n periods. We present an algorithm that has a cumulative loss not much larger than any strategy in a ﬁnite class of reference strategies for any sequence of items. Special attention is payed to reference strategies that use a ﬁxed threshold at each step to decide whether a new bin is opened. Some positive and negative results are presented for this case.

<p>Author: Pradeep Ravikumar, Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: The problem of computing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) conﬁguration is a central computational challenge associated with Markov random ﬁelds. There has been some focus on “tree-based” linear programming (LP) relaxations for the MAP problem. This paper develops a family of super-linearly convergent algorithms for solving these LPs, based on proximal minimization schemes using Bregman divergences. As with standard message-passing on graphs, the algorithms are distributed and exploit the underlying graphical structure, and so scale well to large problems. Our algorithms have a double-loop character, with the outer loop corresponding to the proximal sequence, and an inner loop of cyclic Bregman projections used to compute each proximal update. We establish convergence guarantees for our algorithms, and illustrate their performance via some simulations. We also develop two classes of rounding schemes, deterministic and randomized, for obtaining integral conﬁgurations from the LP solutions. Our deterministic rounding schemes use a “re-parameterization” property of our algorithms so that when the LP solution is integral, the MAP solution can be obtained even before the LP-solver converges to the optimum. We also propose graph-structured randomized rounding schemes applicable to iterative LP-solving algorithms in general. We analyze the performance of and report simulations comparing these rounding schemes.

<p>Author: Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis class used, independently of any algorithm. In contrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight generalization bounds that are tailored to speciﬁc learning algorithms by exploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory, existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the samples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence. This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a stationary ϕ-mixing or β-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in the study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between observations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based generalization bounds for stationary ϕ-mixing and β-mixing sequences. These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply to all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of stability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios. We also illustrate the application of our ϕ-mixing generalization bounds to general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression, Kernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel regularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms. These novel bounds can thus be viewed as the ﬁrst theoretical basis for the use of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios.

<p>Author: Lin Xiao</p><p>Abstract: We consider regularized stochastic learning and online optimization problems, where the objective function is the sum of two convex terms: one is the loss function of the learning task, and the other is a simple regularization term such as ℓ1 -norm for promoting sparsity. We develop extensions of Nesterov’s dual averaging method, that can exploit the regularization structure in an online setting. At each iteration of these methods, the learning variables are adjusted by solving a simple minimization problem that involves the running average of all past subgradients of the loss function and the whole regularization term, not just its subgradient. In the case of ℓ1 -regularization, our method is particularly effective in obtaining sparse solutions. We show that these methods achieve the optimal convergence rates or regret bounds that are standard in the literature on stochastic and online convex optimization. For stochastic learning problems in which the loss functions have Lipschitz continuous gradients, we also present an accelerated version of the dual averaging method.

<p>Author: Christoforos Christoforou, Robert Haralick, Paul Sajda, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: Traditional analysis methods for single-trial classiﬁcation of electro-encephalography (EEG) focus on two types of paradigms: phase-locked methods, in which the amplitude of the signal is used as the feature for classiﬁcation, that is, event related potentials; and second-order methods, in which the feature of interest is the power of the signal, that is, event related (de)synchronization. The process of deciding which paradigm to use is ad hoc and is driven by assumptions regarding the underlying neural generators. Here we propose a method that provides an uniﬁed framework for the analysis of EEG, combining ﬁrst and second-order spatial and temporal features based on a bilinear model. Evaluation of the proposed method on simulated data shows that the technique outperforms state-of-the art techniques for single-trial classiﬁcation for a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios. Evaluations on human EEG—including one benchmark data set from the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) competition—show statistically signiﬁcant gains in classiﬁcation accuracy, with a reduction in overall classiﬁcation error from 26%-28% to 19%.

<p>Author: Franz Pernkopf, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a simple order-based greedy heuristic for learning discriminative structure within generative Bayesian network classiﬁers. We propose two methods for establishing an order of N features. They are based on the conditional mutual information and classiﬁcation rate (i.e., risk), respectively. Given an ordering, we can ﬁnd a discriminative structure with O N k+1 score evaluations (where constant k is the tree-width of the sub-graph over the attributes). We present results on 25 data sets from the UCI repository, for phonetic classiﬁcation using the TIMIT database, for a visual surface inspection task, and for two handwritten digit recognition tasks. We provide classiﬁcation performance for both discriminative and generative parameter learning on both discriminatively and generatively structured networks. The discriminative structure found by our new procedures signiﬁcantly outperforms generatively produced structures, and achieves a classiﬁcation accuracy on par with the best discriminative (greedy) Bayesian network learning approach, but does so with a factor of ∼10-40 speedup. We also show that the advantages of generative discriminatively structured Bayesian network classiﬁers still hold in the case of missing features, a case where generative classiﬁers have an advantage over discriminative classiﬁers.

<p>Author: Jarkko Venna, Jaakko Peltonen, Kristian Nybo, Helena Aidos, Samuel Kaski</p><p>Abstract: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods are often used to visualize high-dimensional data, although the existing methods have been designed for other related tasks such as manifold learning. It has been difﬁcult to assess the quality of visualizations since the task has not been well-deﬁned. We give a rigorous deﬁnition for a speciﬁc visualization task, resulting in quantiﬁable goodness measures and new visualization methods. The task is information retrieval given the visualization: to ﬁnd similar data based on the similarities shown on the display. The fundamental tradeoff between precision and recall of information retrieval can then be quantiﬁed in visualizations as well. The user needs to give the relative cost of missing similar points vs. retrieving dissimilar points, after which the total cost can be measured. We then introduce a new method NeRV (neighbor retrieval visualizer) which produces an optimal visualization by minimizing the cost. We further derive a variant for supervised visualization; class information is taken rigorously into account when computing the similarity relationships. We show empirically that the unsupervised version outperforms existing unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods in the visualization task, and the supervised version outperforms existing supervised methods.

This relationship yields variations on conventional FDA based on the pseudoinverse and a direct equivalence to an ordinary least squares estimator.

<p>Author: Nicola Segata, Enrico Blanzieri</p><p>Abstract: A computationally efﬁcient approach to local learning with kernel methods is presented. The Fast Local Kernel Support Vector Machine (FaLK-SVM) trains a set of local SVMs on redundant neighbourhoods in the training set and an appropriate model for each query point is selected at testing time according to a proximity strategy. Supported by a recent result by Zakai and Ritov (2009) relating consistency and localizability, our approach achieves high classiﬁcation accuracies by dividing the separation function in local optimisation problems that can be handled very efﬁciently from the computational viewpoint. The introduction of a fast local model selection further speeds-up the learning process. Learning and complexity bounds are derived for FaLK-SVM, and the empirical evaluation of the approach (with data sets up to 3 million points) showed that it is much faster and more accurate and scalable than state-of-the-art accurate and approximated SVM solvers at least for non high-dimensional data sets. More generally, we show that locality can be an important factor to sensibly speed-up learning approaches and kernel methods, differently from other recent techniques that tend to dismiss local information in order to improve scalability.

<p>Author: Yevgeny Seldin, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: We derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for supervised and unsupervised learning models based on clustering, such as co-clustering, matrix tri-factorization, graphical models, graph clustering, and pairwise clustering.1 We begin with the analysis of co-clustering, which is a widely used approach to the analysis of data matrices. We distinguish among two tasks in matrix data analysis: discriminative prediction of the missing entries in data matrices and estimation of the joint probability distribution of row and column variables in co-occurrence matrices. We derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for the expected out-of-sample performance of co-clustering-based solutions for these two tasks. The analysis yields regularization terms that were absent in the previous formulations of co-clustering. The bounds suggest that the expected performance of co-clustering is governed by a trade-off between its empirical performance and the mutual information preserved by the cluster variables on row and column IDs. We derive an iterative projection algorithm for ﬁnding a local optimum of this trade-off for discriminative prediction tasks. This algorithm achieved stateof-the-art performance in the MovieLens collaborative ﬁltering task. Our co-clustering model can also be seen as matrix tri-factorization and the results provide generalization bounds, regularization terms, and new algorithms for this form of matrix factorization. The analysis of co-clustering is extended to tree-shaped graphical models, which can be used to analyze high dimensional tensors. According to the bounds, the generalization abilities of treeshaped graphical models depend on a trade-off between their empirical data ﬁt and the mutual information that is propagated up the tree levels. We also formulate weighted graph clustering as a prediction problem: given a subset of edge weights we analyze the ability of graph clustering to predict the remaining edge weights.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Gilles Blanchard, Gyemin Lee, Clayton Scott</p><p>Abstract: A common setting for novelty detection assumes that labeled examples from the nominal class are available, but that labeled examples of novelties are unavailable. The standard (inductive) approach is to declare novelties where the nominal density is low, which reduces the problem to density level set estimation. In this paper, we consider the setting where an unlabeled and possibly contaminated sample is also available at learning time. We argue that novelty detection in this semi-supervised setting is naturally solved by a general reduction to a binary classiﬁcation problem. In particular, a detector with a desired false positive rate can be achieved through a reduction to Neyman-Pearson classiﬁcation. Unlike the inductive approach, semi-supervised novelty detection (SSND) yields detectors that are optimal (e.g., statistically consistent) regardless of the distribution on novelties. Therefore, in novelty detection, unlabeled data have a substantial impact on the theoretical properties of the decision rule. We validate the practical utility of SSND with an extensive experimental study. We also show that SSND provides distribution-free, learning-theoretic solutions to two well known problems in hypothesis testing. First, our results provide a general solution to the general two-sample problem, that is, the problem of determining whether two random samples arise from the same distribution. Second, a specialization of SSND coincides with the standard p-value approach to multiple testing under the so-called random effects model. Unlike standard rejection regions based on thresholded p-values, the general SSND framework allows for adaptation to arbitrary alternative distributions in multiple dimensions.

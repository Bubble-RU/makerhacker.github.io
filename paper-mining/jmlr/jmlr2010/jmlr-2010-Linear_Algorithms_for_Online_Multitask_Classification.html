Through reduction to a Sylvester equation we improve the time e complexity of kernel computation between unlabeled graphs with n vertices from O(n6 ) to O(n3 ). We ﬁnd a spectral decomposition approach even more efﬁcient when computing entire kernel matrices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and ﬁxed-point methods that take O(dn3 ) time per iteration, where d is the size of the label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge kernels, and O(n4 ) in the inﬁnite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs these algorithms only take O(n2 ) time per iteration in all cases. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that these techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of magnitude or more. We also show that certain rational kernels (Cortes et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) when specialized to graphs reduce to our random walk graph kernel.

<p>Author: Andreas Argyriou, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning a matrix W from a set of linear measurements. Our formulation consists in solving an optimization problem which involves regularization with a spectral penalty term. That is, the penalty term is a function of the spectrum of the covariance of W . Instances of this problem in machine learning include multi-task learning, collaborative ﬁltering and multi-view learning, among others. Our goal is to elucidate the form of the optimal solution of spectral learning. The theory of spectral learning relies on the von Neumann characterization of orthogonally invariant norms and their association with symmetric gauge functions. Using this tool we formulate a representer theorem for spectral regularization and specify it to several useful example, such as Schatten p−norms, trace norm and spectral norm, which should proved useful in applications.

<p>Author: Dapo Omidiran, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of high-dimensional variable selection: given n noisy observations of a k-sparse vector β∗ ∈ R p , estimate the subset of non-zero entries of β∗ . A signiﬁcant body of work has studied behavior of ℓ1 -relaxations when applied to random measurement matrices that are dense (e.g., Gaussian, Bernoulli). In this paper, we analyze sparsiﬁed measurement ensembles, and consider the trade-off between measurement sparsity, as measured by the fraction γ of nonzero entries, and the statistical efﬁciency, as measured by the minimal number of observations n required for correct variable selection with probability converging to one. Our main result is to prove that it is possible to let the fraction on non-zero entries γ → 0 at some rate, yielding measurement matrices with a vanishing fraction of non-zeros per row, while retaining the same statistical efﬁciency as dense ensembles. A variety of simulation results conﬁrm the sharpness of our theoretical predictions.

<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Martin J. Wainwright, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Methods based on ℓ1 -relaxation, such as basis pursuit and the Lasso, are very popular for sparse regression in high dimensions. The conditions for success of these methods are now well-understood: (1) exact recovery in the noiseless setting is possible if and only if the design matrix X satisﬁes the restricted nullspace property, and (2) the squared ℓ2 -error of a Lasso estimate decays at the minimax optimal rate k log p , where k is the sparsity of the p-dimensional regression problem with additive n Gaussian noise, whenever the design satisﬁes a restricted eigenvalue condition. The key issue is thus to determine when the design matrix X satisﬁes these desirable properties. Thus far, there have been numerous results showing that the restricted isometry property, which implies both the restricted nullspace and eigenvalue conditions, is satisﬁed when all entries of X are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), or the rows are unitary. This paper proves directly that the restricted nullspace and eigenvalue conditions hold with high probability for quite general classes of Gaussian matrices for which the predictors may be highly dependent, and hence restricted isometry conditions can be violated with high probability. In this way, our results extend the attractive theoretical guarantees on ℓ1 -relaxations to a much broader class of problems than the case of completely independent or unitary designs.

<p>Author: Kamaledin Ghiasi-Shirazi, Reza Safabakhsh, Mostafa Shamsi</p><p>Abstract: Appropriate selection of the kernel function, which implicitly deﬁnes the feature space of an algorithm, has a crucial role in the success of kernel methods. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing a kernel function over the class of translation invariant kernels for the task of binary classiﬁcation. The learning capacity of this class is invariant with respect to rotation and scaling of the features and it encompasses the set of radial kernels. We show that how translation invariant kernel functions can be embedded in a nested set of sub-classes and consider the kernel learning problem over one of these sub-classes. This allows the choice of an appropriate sub-class based on the problem at hand. We use the criterion proposed by Lanckriet et al. (2004) to obtain a functional formulation for the problem. It will be proven that the optimal kernel is a ﬁnite mixture of cosine functions. The kernel learning problem is then formulated as a semi-inﬁnite programming (SIP) problem which is solved by a sequence of quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) sub-problems. Using the fact that the cosine kernel is of rank two, we propose a formulation of a QCQP sub-problem which does not require the kernel matrices to be loaded into memory, making the method applicable to large-scale problems. We also address the issue of including other classes of kernels, such as individual kernels and isotropic Gaussian kernels, in the learning process. Another interesting feature of the proposed method is that the optimal classiﬁer has an expansion in terms of the number of cosine kernels, instead of support vectors, leading to a remarkable speedup at run-time. As a by-product, we also generalize the kernel trick to complex-valued kernel functions. Our experiments on artiﬁcial and real-world benchmark data sets, including the USPS and the MNIST digit recognition data sets, show the usefulness of the proposed method.

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Varun Sharma, Uri Shalit, Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Learning a measure of similarity between pairs of objects is an important generic problem in machine learning. It is particularly useful in large scale applications like searching for an image that is similar to a given image or ﬁnding videos that are relevant to a given video. In these tasks, users look for objects that are not only visually similar but also semantically related to a given object. Unfortunately, the approaches that exist today for learning such semantic similarity do not scale to large data sets. This is both because typically their CPU and storage requirements grow quadratically with the sample size, and because many methods impose complex positivity constraints on the space of learned similarity functions. The current paper presents OASIS, an Online Algorithm for Scalable Image Similarity learning that learns a bilinear similarity measure over sparse representations. OASIS is an online dual approach using the passive-aggressive family of learning algorithms with a large margin criterion and an efﬁcient hinge loss cost. Our experiments show that OASIS is both fast and accurate at a wide range of scales: for a data set with thousands of images, it achieves better results than existing state-of-the-art methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. For large, web scale, data sets, OASIS can be trained on more than two million images from 150K text queries within 3 days on a single CPU. On this large scale data set, human evaluations showed that 35% of the ten nearest neighbors of a given test image, as found by OASIS, were semantically relevant to that image. This suggests that query independent similarity could be accurately learned even for large scale data sets that could not be handled before.

<p>Author: Giovanni Cavallanti, Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile</p><p>Abstract: We introduce new Perceptron-based algorithms for the online multitask binary classiﬁcation problem. Under suitable regularity conditions, our algorithms are shown to improve on their baselines by a factor proportional to the number of tasks. We achieve these improvements using various types of regularization that bias our algorithms towards speciﬁc notions of task relatedness. More specifically, similarity among tasks is either measured in terms of the geometric closeness of the task reference vectors or as a function of the dimension of their spanned subspace. In addition to adapting to the online setting a mix of known techniques, such as the multitask kernels of Evgeniou et al., our analysis also introduces a matrix-based multitask extension of the p-norm Perceptron, which is used to implement spectral co-regularization. Experiments on real-world data sets complement and support our theoretical ﬁndings.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Fabian Sinz, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new family of probability densities called L p -nested symmetric distributions. The common property, shared by all members of the new class, is the same functional form ˜ x x ρ(x ) = ρ( f (x )), where f is a nested cascade of L p -norms x p = (∑ |xi | p )1/p . L p -nested symmetric distributions thereby are a special case of ν-spherical distributions for which f is only required to be positively homogeneous of degree one. While both, ν-spherical and L p -nested symmetric distributions, contain many widely used families of probability models such as the Gaussian, spherically and elliptically symmetric distributions, L p -spherically symmetric distributions, and certain types of independent component analysis (ICA) and independent subspace analysis (ISA) models, ν-spherical distributions are usually computationally intractable. Here we demonstrate that L p nested symmetric distributions are still computationally feasible by deriving an analytic expression for its normalization constant, gradients for maximum likelihood estimation, analytic expressions for certain types of marginals, as well as an exact and efﬁcient sampling algorithm. We discuss the tight links of L p -nested symmetric distributions to well known machine learning methods such as ICA, ISA and mixed norm regularizers, and introduce the nested radial factorization algorithm (NRF), which is a form of non-linear ICA that transforms any linearly mixed, non-factorial L p nested symmetric source into statistically independent signals. As a corollary, we also introduce the uniform distribution on the L p -nested unit sphere.

<p>Author: Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Ohad Shamir, Nathan Srebro, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: The problem of characterizing learnability is the most basic question of statistical learning theory. A fundamental and long-standing answer, at least for the case of supervised classiﬁcation and regression, is that learnability is equivalent to uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the population risk, and that if a problem is learnable, it is learnable via empirical risk minimization. In this paper, we consider the General Learning Setting (introduced by Vapnik), which includes most statistical learning problems as special cases. We show that in this setting, there are non-trivial learning problems where uniform convergence does not hold, empirical risk minimization fails, and yet they are learnable using alternative mechanisms. Instead of uniform convergence, we identify stability as the key necessary and sufﬁcient condition for learnability. Moreover, we show that the conditions for learnability in the general setting are signiﬁcantly more complex than in supervised classiﬁcation and regression.

<p>Author: Kamaledin Ghiasi-Shirazi, Reza Safabakhsh, Mostafa Shamsi</p><p>Abstract: Appropriate selection of the kernel function, which implicitly deﬁnes the feature space of an algorithm, has a crucial role in the success of kernel methods. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing a kernel function over the class of translation invariant kernels for the task of binary classiﬁcation. The learning capacity of this class is invariant with respect to rotation and scaling of the features and it encompasses the set of radial kernels. We show that how translation invariant kernel functions can be embedded in a nested set of sub-classes and consider the kernel learning problem over one of these sub-classes. This allows the choice of an appropriate sub-class based on the problem at hand. We use the criterion proposed by Lanckriet et al. (2004) to obtain a functional formulation for the problem. It will be proven that the optimal kernel is a ﬁnite mixture of cosine functions. The kernel learning problem is then formulated as a semi-inﬁnite programming (SIP) problem which is solved by a sequence of quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) sub-problems. Using the fact that the cosine kernel is of rank two, we propose a formulation of a QCQP sub-problem which does not require the kernel matrices to be loaded into memory, making the method applicable to large-scale problems. We also address the issue of including other classes of kernels, such as individual kernels and isotropic Gaussian kernels, in the learning process. Another interesting feature of the proposed method is that the optimal classiﬁer has an expansion in terms of the number of cosine kernels, instead of support vectors, leading to a remarkable speedup at run-time. As a by-product, we also generalize the kernel trick to complex-valued kernel functions. Our experiments on artiﬁcial and real-world benchmark data sets, including the USPS and the MNIST digit recognition data sets, show the usefulness of the proposed method.

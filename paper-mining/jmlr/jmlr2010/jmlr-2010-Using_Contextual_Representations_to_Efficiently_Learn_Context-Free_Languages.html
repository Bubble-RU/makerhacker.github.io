<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen, Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic grammars offer great ﬂexibility in modeling discrete sequential data like natural language text. Their symbolic component is amenable to inspection by humans, while their probabilistic component helps resolve ambiguity. They also permit the use of well-understood, generalpurpose learning algorithms. There has been an increased interest in using probabilistic grammars in the Bayesian setting. To date, most of the literature has focused on using a Dirichlet prior. The Dirichlet prior has several limitations, including that it cannot directly model covariance between the probabilistic grammar’s parameters. Yet, various grammar parameters are expected to be correlated because the elements in language they represent share linguistic properties. In this paper, we suggest an alternative to the Dirichlet prior, a family of logistic normal distributions. We derive an inference algorithm for this family of distributions and experiment with the task of dependency grammar induction, demonstrating performance improvements with our priors on a set of six treebanks in different natural languages. Our covariance framework permits soft parameter tying within grammars and across grammars for text in different languages, and we show empirical gains in a novel learning setting using bilingual, non-parallel data.

<p>Author: Trevor Cohn, Phil Blunsom, Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: Inducing a grammar from text has proven to be a notoriously challenging learning task despite decades of research. The primary reason for its difﬁculty is that in order to induce plausible grammars, the underlying model must be capable of representing the intricacies of language while also ensuring that it can be readily learned from data. The majority of existing work on grammar induction has favoured model simplicity (and thus learnability) over representational capacity by using context free grammars and ﬁrst order dependency grammars, which are not sufﬁciently expressive to model many common linguistic constructions. We propose a novel compromise by inferring a probabilistic tree substitution grammar, a formalism which allows for arbitrarily large tree fragments and thereby better represent complex linguistic structures. To limit the model’s complexity we employ a Bayesian non-parametric prior which biases the model towards a sparse grammar with shallow productions. We demonstrate the model’s efﬁcacy on supervised phrase-structure parsing, where we induce a latent segmentation of the training treebank, and on unsupervised dependency grammar induction. In both cases the model uncovers interesting latent linguistic structures while producing competitive results.

<p>Author: James Henderson, Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: We propose a class of Bayesian networks appropriate for structured prediction problems where the Bayesian network’s model structure is a function of the predicted output structure. These incremental sigmoid belief networks (ISBNs) make decoding possible because inference with partial output structures does not require summing over the unboundedly many compatible model structures, due to their directed edges and incrementally speciﬁed model structure. ISBNs are speciﬁcally targeted at challenging structured prediction problems such as natural language parsing, where learning the domain’s complex statistical dependencies beneﬁts from large numbers of latent variables. While exact inference in ISBNs with large numbers of latent variables is not tractable, we propose two efﬁcient approximations. First, we demonstrate that a previous neural network parsing model can be viewed as a coarse mean-ﬁeld approximation to inference with ISBNs. We then derive a more accurate but still tractable variational approximation, which proves effective in artiﬁcial experiments. We compare the effectiveness of these models on a benchmark natural language parsing task, where they achieve accuracy competitive with the state-of-the-art. The model which is a closer approximation to an ISBN has better parsing accuracy, suggesting that ISBNs are an appropriate abstract model of natural language grammar learning.

<p>Author: Konrad Rieck, Tammo Krueger, Ulf Brefeld, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Convolution kernels for trees provide simple means for learning with tree-structured data. The computation time of tree kernels is quadratic in the size of the trees, since all pairs of nodes need to be compared. Thus, large parse trees, obtained from HTML documents or structured network data, render convolution kernels inapplicable. In this article, we propose an effective approximation technique for parse tree kernels. The approximate tree kernels (ATKs) limit kernel computation to a sparse subset of relevant subtrees and discard redundant structures, such that training and testing of kernel-based learning methods are signiﬁcantly accelerated. We devise linear programming approaches for identifying such subsets for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, respectively. Empirically, the approximate tree kernels attain run-time improvements up to three orders of magnitude while preserving the predictive accuracy of regular tree kernels. For unsupervised tasks, the approximate tree kernels even lead to more accurate predictions by identifying relevant dimensions in feature space.

<p>Author: Gérard Biau, Frédéric Cérou, Arnaud Guyader</p><p>Abstract: Bagging is a simple way to combine estimates in order to improve their performance. This method, suggested by Breiman in 1996, proceeds by resampling from the original data set, constructing a predictor from each subsample, and decide by combining. By bagging an n-sample, the crude nearest neighbor regression estimate is turned into a consistent weighted nearest neighbor regression estimate, which is amenable to statistical analysis. Letting the resampling size kn grows appropriately with n, it is shown that this estimate may achieve optimal rate of convergence, independently from the fact that resampling is done with or without replacement. Since the estimate with the optimal rate of convergence depends on the unknown distribution of the observations, adaptation results by data-splitting are presented.

<p>Author: Joshua V. Dillon, Guy Lebanon</p><p>Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimators are often of limited practical use due to the intensive computation they require. We propose a family of alternative estimators that maximize a stochastic variation of the composite likelihood function. Each of the estimators resolve the computation-accuracy tradeoff differently, and taken together they span a continuous spectrum of computation-accuracy tradeoff resolutions. We prove the consistency of the estimators, provide formulas for their asymptotic variance, statistical robustness, and computational complexity. We discuss experimental results in the context of Boltzmann machines and conditional random ﬁelds. The theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimators when the computational resources are insufﬁcient. They also demonstrate that in some cases reduced computational complexity is associated with robustness thereby increasing statistical accuracy.

<p>Author: Valero Laparra, Juan Gutiérrez, Gustavo Camps-Valls, Jesús Malo</p><p>Abstract: A successful class of image denoising methods is based on Bayesian approaches working in wavelet representations. The performance of these methods improves when relations among the local frequency coefﬁcients are explicitly included. However, in these techniques, analytical estimates can be obtained only for particular combinations of analytical models of signal and noise, thus precluding its straightforward extension to deal with other arbitrary noise sources. In this paper, we propose an alternative non-explicit way to take into account the relations among natural image wavelet coefﬁcients for denoising: we use support vector regression (SVR) in the wavelet domain to enforce these relations in the estimated signal. Since relations among the coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to the signal, the regularization property of SVR is exploited to remove the noise, which does not share this feature. The speciﬁc signal relations are encoded in an anisotropic kernel obtained from mutual information measures computed on a representative image database. In the proposed scheme, training considers minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the estimated and actual probability functions (or histograms) of signal and noise in order to enforce similarity up to the higher (computationally estimable) order. Due to its non-parametric nature, the method can eventually cope with different noise sources without the need of an explicit re-formulation, as it is strictly necessary under parametric Bayesian formalisms. Results under several noise levels and noise sources show that: (1) the proposed method outperforms conventional wavelet methods that assume coefﬁcient independence, (2) it is similar to state-of-the-art methods that do explicitly include these relations when the noise source is Gaussian, and (3) it gives better numerical and visual performance when more complex, realistic noise sources are considered. Therefore, the proposed machine learning approach can be seen as a mor</p><p>3 0.30356219 <a title="115-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2010-Error-Correcting_Output_Codes_Library.html">35 jmlr-2010-Error-Correcting Output Codes Library</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergio Escalera, Oriol Pujol, Petia Radeva</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an open source Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) library. The ECOC framework is a powerful tool to deal with multi-class categorization problems. This library contains both state-of-the-art coding (one-versus-one, one-versus-all, dense random, sparse random, DECOC, forest-ECOC, and ECOC-ONE) and decoding designs (hamming, euclidean, inverse hamming, laplacian, β-density, attenuated, loss-based, probabilistic kernel-based, and lossweighted) with the parameters deﬁned by the authors, as well as the option to include your own coding, decoding, and base classiﬁer. Keywords: error-correcting output codes, multi-class classiﬁcation, coding, decoding, open source, matlab, octave 1. Error-Correcting Output Codes The Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) framework (Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995) is a simple but powerful framework to deal with the multi-class categorization problem based on the embedding of binary classiﬁers. Given a set of Nc classes, the basis of the ECOC framework consists of designing a codeword for each of the classes. These codewords encode the membership information of each class for a given binary problem. Arranging the codewords as rows of a matrix, we obtain a ”coding matrix” Mc , where Mc ∈ {−1, 0, 1}Nc ×n , being n the length of the codewords codifying each class. From the point of view of learning, Mc is constructed by considering n binary problems, each one corresponding to a column of the matrix Mc . Each of these binary problems (or dichotomizers) splits the set of classes in two partitions (coded by +1 or -1 in Mc according to their class set membership, or 0 if the class is not considered by the current binary problem). Then, at the decoding step, applying the n trained binary classiﬁers, a code is obtained for each data point in the test set. This code is compared to the base codewords of each class deﬁned in the matrix Mc , and the data point is assigned to the class with the ”closest” codeword. Several decoding strategies have been proposed in literature. The reader is referred to Escalera et al. (2008) for a more detailed review. An example of an ECOC design is described in Fig. 1. The ECOC designs are independent of the base classiﬁer applied. They involve error-correcting properties (Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995) and have shown to be able to reduce the bias and variance produced by the learning algorithm (Kong and Dietterich, 1995). Because of these reasons, ECOCs have been widely used to deal with multi-class categorization problems. c 2010 Sergio Escalera, Oriol Pujol and Petia Radeva.

Once the four binary problems are learnt, at the decoding step a new test sample X is tested by the n classiﬁers. Then, the new codeword x = {x1 , .., xn } is compared with the class codewords {C1 , ..C4 }, classifying the new sample by the class ci which codeword minimizes the decoding measure. Figure 1: ECOC design example. 2. Library Algorithms The ECOCs library is a Matlab/Octave code under the open source GPL license (gpl) with the implementation of the state-of-the-art coding and decoding ECOC designs. A main function deﬁnes the multi-class data, coding, decoding, and base classiﬁer. A list of parameters are also included in order to tune the different strategies. In addition to the implemented coding and decoding designs, which are described in the following section, the user can include his own coding, decoding, and base classiﬁer as deﬁned in the user guide. 2.1 Implemented Coding Designs The ECOC designs of the ECOC library cover the state-of-the-art of coding strategies, mainly divided in two main groups: problem-independent approaches, which do not take into account the distribution of the data to deﬁne the coding matrix, and the problem-dependent designs, where information of the particular domain is used to guide the coding design. 2.1.1 P ROBLEM - INDEPENDENT ECOC D ESIGNS • One-versus-all (Rifkin and Klautau, 2004): Nc dichotomizers are learnt for Nc classes, where each one splits one class from the rest of classes. • One-versus-one (Nilsson, 1965): n = Nc (Nc − 1)/2 dichotomizers are learnt for Nc classes, splitting each possible pair of classes. • Dense Random (Allwein et al., 2002): n = 10 · log Nc dichotomizers are suggested to be learnt for Nc classes, where P(−1) = 1 − P(+1), being P(−1) and P(+1) the probability of the symbols -1 and +1 to appear, respectively. Then, from a set of deﬁned random matrices, the one which maximizes a decoding measure among all possible rows of Mc is selected. • Sparse Random (Escalera et al., 2009): n = 15 · log Nc dichotomizers are suggested to be learnt for Nc classes, where P(0) = 1 − P(−1) − P(+1), deﬁning a set of random matrices Mc and selecting the one which maximizes a decoding measure among all possible rows of Mc . 662 E RROR -C ORRECTING O UPUT C ODES L IBRARY 2.1.2 P ROBLEM - DEPENDENT ECOC D ESIGNS • DECOC (Pujol et al., 2006): problem-dependent design that uses n = Nc − 1 dichotomizers. The partitions of the problem are learnt by means of a binary tree structure using exhaustive search or a SFFS criterion. Finally, each internal node of the tree is embedded as a column in Mc . • Forest-ECOC (Escalera et al., 2007): problem-dependent design that uses n = (Nc − 1) · T dichotomizers, where T stands for the number of binary tree structures to be embedded. This approach extends the variability of the classiﬁers of the DECOC design by including extra dichotomizers. • ECOC-ONE (Pujol et al., 2008): problem-dependent design that uses n = 2 · Nc suggested dichotomizers. A validation sub-set is used to extend any initial matrix Mc and to increase its generalization by including new dichotomizers that focus on difﬁcult to split classes. 2.2 Implemented Decoding Designs The software comes with a complete set of ECOC decoding strategies. The notation used refers to that used in (Escalera et al., 2008): j • Hamming decoding: HD(x, yi ) = ∑n (1 − sign(x j · yi ))/2, being x a test codeword and yi a j=1 codeword from Mc corresponding to class Ci . • Inverse Hamming decoding: IHD(x, yi ) = max(∆−1 DT ), where ∆(i1 , i2 ) = HD(yi1 , yi2 ), and D is the vector of Hamming decoding values of the test codeword x for each of the base codewords yi . • Euclidean decoding: ED(x, yi ) = j ∑n (x j − yi )2 . j=1 • Attenuated Euclidean decoding: AED(x, yi ) = j j ∑n | yi || x j | (x j − yi )2 . j=1 • Loss-based decoding: LB(ρ, yi ) = ∑n L(yi · f j (ρ)), where ρ is a test sample, L is a lossj=1 function, and f is a real-valued function f : R n → R . j • Probabilistic-based decoding: PD(yi , x)=−log ∏ j∈[1,..,n]:Mc (i, j)=0 P(x j = Mc (i, j)| f j ) + K , where K is a constant factor that collects the probability mass dispersed on the invalid codes, and the probability P(x j = Mc (i, j)| f j ) j 1 , where vectors υ and ω are obtained by is estimated by means of P(x j = yi | f j ) = j j j j 1+eyi (υ f +ω ) solving an optimization problem (Passerini et al., 2004). αi +1 • Laplacian decoding: LAP(x, yi ) = αi +βi +K , where αi is the number of matched positions between x and yi , βi is the number of miss-matches without considering the positions coded by 0, and K is an integer value that codiﬁes the number of classes considered by the classiﬁer. νi 1 • Pessimistic β-Density Distribution decoding: accuracy si : νi −si ψi (ν, αi , βi )dν = 3 , where 1 ψi (ν, αi , βi ) = K ναi (1 − ν)βi , ψi is the β-Density Distribution between a codeword x and a class codeword yi for class ci , and ν ∈ R : [0, 1]. R j • Loss-Weighted decoding: LW (ρ, i) = ∑n MW (i, j)L(yi · f (ρ, j)), where MW (i, j) = ∑nH(i, j) j) , j=1 H(i, j=1 j 1, if x j = yi , 1 H(i, j) = mi ∑mi ϕ(h j (ρi ), i, j), ϕ(x j , i, j) = , mi is the number of training k k=1 0, otherwise. samples from class Ci , and ρi is the kth sample from class Ci . k 663 E SCALERA , P UJOL AND R ADEVA 3. Implementation Details The ECOCs Library comes with detailed documentation. A user guide describes the usage of the software. All the strategies and parameters used in the functions and ﬁles are described in detail. The user guide also presents examples of variable setting and execution, including a demo ﬁle. About the computational complexity, the training and testing time depends on the data size, coding and decoding algorithms, as well as the base classiﬁer used in the ECOC design.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discretevalued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation. The measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of stochastic process measures. We are interested in predictors ρ whose conditional probabilities converge (in some sense) to the “true” µ-conditional probabilities, if any µ ∈ C is chosen to generate the sequence. The contribution of this work is in characterizing the families C for which such predictors exist, and in providing a speciﬁc and simple form in which to look for a solution. We show that if any predictor works, then there exists a Bayesian predictor, whose prior is discrete, and which works too. We also ﬁnd several sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for the existence of a predictor, in terms of topological characterizations of the family C , as well as in terms of local behaviour of the measures in C , which in some cases lead to procedures for constructing such predictors. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the stochastic processes considered are not required to be i.i.d., stationary, or to belong to any parametric or countable family.

<p>Author: Vicenç Gómez, Hilbert J. Kappen, Michael Chertkov</p><p>Abstract: We introduce novel results for approximate inference on planar graphical models using the loop calculus framework. The loop calculus (Chertkov and Chernyak, 2006a) allows to express the exact partition function of a graphical model as a ﬁnite sum of terms that can be evaluated once the belief propagation (BP) solution is known. In general, full summation over all correction terms is intractable. We develop an algorithm for the approach presented in Chertkov et al. (2008) which represents an efﬁcient truncation scheme on planar graphs and a new representation of the series in terms of Pfafﬁans of matrices. We analyze the performance of the algorithm for models with binary variables and pairwise interactions on grids and other planar graphs. We study in detail both the loop series and the equivalent Pfafﬁan series and show that the ﬁrst term of the Pfafﬁan series for the general, intractable planar model, can provide very accurate approximations. The algorithm outperforms previous truncation schemes of the loop series and is competitive with other state of the art methods for approximate inference.

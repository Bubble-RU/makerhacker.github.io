For these models, restricted to the realizable case, we show a reduction of active learning to selective classiﬁcation that preserves fast rates. Applying this reduction to recent results for selective classiﬁcation, we derive exponential target-independent label complexity speedup for actively learning general (non-homogeneous) linear classiﬁers when the data distribution is an arbitrary high dimensional mixture of Gaussians. Finally, we study the relation between the proposed technique and existing label complexity measures, including teaching dimension and disagreement coefﬁcient.

Introduction and Related Work Active learning is an intriguing learning model that provides the learning algorithm with some control over the learning process, potentially leading to signiﬁcantly faster learning. In recent years it has been gaining considerable recognition as a vital technique for efﬁciently implementing inductive learning in many industrial applications where abundance of unlabeled data exists, and/or in cases where labeling costs are high. In this paper we expose a strong relation between active learning and selective classiﬁcation, another known alternative learning model (Chow, 1970; El-Yaniv and Wiener, 2010). Focusing on binary classiﬁcation in realizable settings we consider standard stream-based active learning, which is also referred to as online selective sampling (Atlas et al., 1990; Cohn et al., 1994). In this model the learner is given an error objective ε and then sequentially receives unlabeled examples. At each step, after observing an unlabeled example x, the learner decides whether or not to request the label of x. The learner should terminate the learning process and output a binary classiﬁer whose true error is guaranteed to be at most ε with high probability. The penalty incurred by the learner is the number of label requests made and this number is called the label complexity. A label complexity bound of O(d log(d/ε)) for actively learning ε-good classiﬁer from a concept class with VC-dimension d, provides an exponential speedup in terms of 1/ε relative to standard (passive) supervised learning where the sample complexity is typically O(d/ε). The study of (stream-based, realizable) active learning is paved with very interesting theoretical results. Initially, only a few cases were known where active learning provides signiﬁcant advanc 2012 Ran El-Yaniv and Yair Wiener. E L -YANIV AND W IENER tage over passive learning. Perhaps the most favorable result was an exponential label complexity speedup for learning homogeneous linear classiﬁers where the (linearly separable) data is uniformly distributed over the unit sphere. This result was manifested by various authors using various analysis techniques, for a number of strategies that can all be viewed in hindsight as approximations or variations of the “CAL algorithm” of Cohn et al. (1994). Among these studies, the earlier theoretical results (Seung et al., 1992; Freund et al., 1993, 1997; Fine et al., 2002; Gilad-Bachrach, 2007) considered Bayesian settings and studied the speedup obtained by the Query by Committee (QBC) algorithm. The more recent results provided PAC style analyses (Dasgupta et al., 2009; Hanneke, 2007a, 2009). Lack of positive results for other non-toy problems, as well as various additional negative results that were discovered, led some researchers to believe that active learning is not necessarily advantageous in general. Among the striking negative results is Dasgupta’s negative example for actively learning general (non-homogeneous) linear classiﬁers (even in two dimensions) under the uniform distribution over the sphere (Dasgupta, 2005). A number of recent innovative papers proposed alternative models for active learning. Balcan et al. (2008) introduced a subtle modiﬁcation of the traditional label complexity deﬁnition, which opened up avenues for new positive results. According to their new deﬁnition of “non-veriﬁable” label complexity, the active learner is not required to know when to stop the learning process with a guaranteed ε-good classiﬁer. Their main result, under this deﬁnition, is that active learning is asymptotically better than passive learning in the sense that only o(1/ε) labels are required for actively learning an ε-good classiﬁer from a concept class that has a ﬁnite VC-dimension. Another result they accomplished is an exponential label complexity speedup for (non-veriﬁable) active learning of non-homogeneous linear classiﬁers under the uniform distribution over the the unit sphere. Based on Hanneke’s characterization of active learning in terms of the “disagreement coefﬁcient” (Hanneke, 2007a), Friedman (2009) recently extended the Balcan et al. results and proved that a target-dependent exponential speedup can be asymptotically achieved for a wide range of “smooth” learning problems (in particular, the hypothesis class, the instance space and the distribution should all be expressible by smooth functions). He proved that under such smoothness conditions, for any target hypothesis h∗ , Hanneke’s disagreement coefﬁcient is bounded above in terms of a constant c(h∗ ) that depends on the unknown target hypothesis h∗ (and is independent of δ and ε). The resulting label complexity is O (c(h∗ ) d polylog(d/ε)) (Hanneke, 2011b). This is a very general result but the target-dependent constant involved in this bound is only guaranteed to be ﬁnite. With this impressive progress in the case of target-dependent bounds for active learning, the current state of affairs in the target-independent bounds for active learning arena leaves much to be desired. To date the most advanced result in this model, which was already essentially established by Seung et al. and Freund et al. more than ﬁfteen years ago (Seung et al., 1992; Freund et al., 1993, 1997), is still a target-independent exponential speed up bound for homogeneous linear classiﬁers under the uniform distribution over the sphere. The other learning model we contemplate that will be shown to have strong ties to active learning, is selective classiﬁcation, which is mainly known in the literature as ‘classiﬁcation with a reject option.’ This old-timer model, that was already introduced more than ﬁfty years ago (Chow, 1957, 1970), extends standard supervised learning by allowing the classiﬁer to opt out from predictions in cases where it is not conﬁdent. The incentive is to increase classiﬁcation reliability over instances that are not rejected by the classiﬁer. Thus, using selective classiﬁcation one can potentially achieve 256 ACTIVE L EARNING VIA P ERFECT S ELECTIVE C LASSIFICATION a lower error rate using the same labeling “budget.” The main quantities that characterize a selective classiﬁer are its (true) error and coverage rate (or its complement, the rejection rate). There is already substantial volume of research publications on selective classiﬁcation, that kept emerging through the years. The main theme in many of these publications is the implementation of certain reject mechanisms for speciﬁc learning algorithms like support vector machines and neural networks. Among the few theoretical studies on selective classiﬁcation, there are various excess risk bounds for ERM learning (Herbei and Wegkamp, 2006; Bartlett and Wegkamp, 2008; Wegkamp, 2007), and certain coverage/risk guarantees for selective ensemble methods (Freund et al., 2004). In a recent work (El-Yaniv and Wiener, 2010) the trade-off between error and coverage was examined and in particular, a new extreme case of selective learning was introduced. In this extreme case, termed here “perfect selective classiﬁcation,” the classiﬁer is given m labeled examples and is required to instantly output a classiﬁer whose true error is perfectly zero with certainty. This is of course potentially doable only if the classiﬁer rejects a sufﬁcient portion of the instance space. A non-trivial result for perfect selective classiﬁcation is a high probability lower bound on the classiﬁer coverage (or equivalently, an upper bound on its rejection rate). Such bounds have recently been presented in El-Yaniv and Wiener (2010). In Section 3 we present a reduction of active learning to perfect selective classiﬁcation that preserves “fast rates.” This reduction enables the luxury of analyzing dynamic active learning problems as static problems. Relying on a recent result on perfect selective classiﬁcation from El-Yaniv and Wiener (2010), in Section 4 we then apply our reduction and conclude that general (non-homogeneous) linear classiﬁers are actively learnable at exponential (in 1/ε) label complexity rate when the data distribution is an arbitrary unknown ﬁnite mixture of high dimensional Gaussians. While we obtain exponential label complexity speedup in 1/ε, we incur exponential slowdown in d 2 , where d is the problem dimension. Nevertheless, in Section 5 we prove a lower bound of Ω((log m)(d−1)/2 (1 + o(1)) on the label complexity, when considering the class of unrestricted linear classiﬁers under a Gaussian distribution. Thus, an exponential slowdown in d is unavoidable in such settings. Finally, in Section 6 we relate the proposed technique to other complexity measures for active learning. Proving and using a relation to the teaching dimension (Goldman and Kearns, 1995) we show, by relying on a known bound for the teaching dimension, that perfect selective classiﬁcation with meaningful coverage can be achieved for the case of axis-aligned rectangles under a product distribution. We then focus on Hanneke’s disagreement coefﬁcient and show that the coverage of perfect selective classiﬁcation can be bounded below using the disagreement coefﬁcient. Conversely, we show that the disagreement coefﬁcient can be bounded above using any coverage bound for perfect selective classiﬁcation. Consequently, the results here imply that the disagreement coefﬁcient can be sufﬁciently bounded to ensure fast active learning for the case of linear classiﬁers under a mixture of Gaussians. 2. Active Learning and Perfect Selective Classiﬁcation In binary classiﬁcation the goal is to learn an accurate binary classiﬁer, h : X → {±1}, from a ﬁnite labeled training sample. Here X is some instance space and the standard assumption is that the training sample, Sm = {(xi , yi )}m , containing m labeled examples, is drawn i.i.d. from some i=1 unknown distribution P(X,Y ) deﬁned over X × {±1}. The classiﬁer h is chosen from some hypothesis class H . In this paper we focus on the realizable setting whereby labels are deﬁned by 257 E L -YANIV AND W IENER some unknown target hypothesis h∗ ∈ H . Thus, the underlying distribution reduces to P(X). The performance of a classiﬁer h is quantiﬁed by its true zero-one error, R(h) Pr{h(X) = h∗ (X)}. A positive result for a classiﬁcation problem (H , P) is a learning algorithm that given an error target ε and a conﬁdence parameter δ can output, based on Sm , an hypothesis h whose error R(h) ≤ ε, with probability of at least 1 − δ. A bound B(ε, δ) on the size m of labeled training sample sufﬁcient for achieving this is called the sample complexity of the learning algorithm. A classical result is that any consistent learning algorithm has sample complexity of O( 1 (d log( 1 ) + log( 1 ))), where d is ε ε δ the VC-dimension of H (see, e.g., Anthony and Bartlett, 1999). 2.1 Active Learning We consider the following standard active learning model. In this model the learner sequentially observes unlabeled instances, x1 , x2 , . . ., that are sampled i.i.d. from P(X). After receiving each xi , the learning algorithm decides whether or not to request its label h∗ (xi ), where h∗ ∈ H is an unknown target hypothesis. Before the start of the game the algorithm is provided with some desired error rate ε and conﬁdence level δ. We say that the learning algorithm actively learned the problem instance (H , P) if at some point it can terminate this process, after observing m instances and requesting k labels, and output an hypothesis h ∈ H whose error R(h) ≤ ε, with probability of at least 1 − δ. The quality of the algorithm is quantiﬁed by the number k of requested labels, which is called the label complexity. A positive result for a learning problem (H , P) is a learning algorithm that can actively learn this problem for any given ε and δ, and for every h∗ , with label complexity bounded above by L(ε, δ, h∗ ). If there is a label complexity bound that is O(polylog(1/ε)) we say that the problem is actively learnable at exponential rate. 2.2 Selective Classiﬁcation Following the formulation in El-Yaniv and Wiener (2010) the goal in selective classiﬁcation is to learn a pair of functions (h, g) from a labeled training sample Sm (as deﬁned above for passive learning). The pair (h, g), which is called a selective classiﬁer, consists of a binary classiﬁer h ∈ H , and a selection function, g : X → {0, 1}, which qualiﬁes the classiﬁer h as follows. For any sample x ∈ X , the output of the selective classiﬁer is (h, g)(x) h(x) iff g(x) = 1, and (h, g)(x) abstain iff g(x) = 0. Thus, the function g is a ﬁlter that determines a sub-domain of X over which the selective classiﬁer will abstain from classiﬁcations. A selective classiﬁer is thus characterized by its coverage, Φ(h, g) EP {g(x)}, which is the P-weighted volume of the sub-domain of X that is not ﬁltered out, and its error, R(h, g) = E{I(h(X) = h∗ (X)) · g(X)}/Φ(h, g), which is the zero-one loss restricted to the covered sub-domain. Note that this is a “smooth” generalization of passive learning and, in particular, R(h, g) reduces to R(h) (standard classiﬁcation) if g(x) ≡ 1. We expect to see a trade-off between R(h, g) and Φ(h, g) in the sense that smaller error should be obtained by compromising the coverage. A major issue in selective classiﬁcation is how to optimally control this trade-off. In this paper we are concerned with an extreme case of this trade-off whereby (h, g) is required to achieve a perfect score of zero error with certainty. This extreme learning objective is termed perfect learning in El-Yaniv and Wiener (2010). Thus, for a perfect selective classiﬁer (h, g) we always have R(h, g) = 0, and its quality is determined by its guaranteed coverage. A positive result for (perfect) selective classiﬁcation problem (H , P) is a learning algorithm that uses a labeled training sample Sm (as in passive learning) to output a perfect selective classiﬁer (h, g) for which Φ(h, g) ≥ BΦ (H , δ, m) with probability of at least 1 − δ, for any given δ. The bound 258 ACTIVE L EARNING VIA P ERFECT S ELECTIVE C LASSIFICATION BΦ = BΦ (H , δ, m) is called a coverage bound (or coverage rate) and its complement, 1 − BΦ , is called a rejection bound (or rate). A coverage rate BΦ = 1 − O( polylog(m) ) (and the corresponding m 1 − BΦ rejection rate) are qualiﬁed as fast. 2.3 The CAL Algorithm and the Consistent Selective Strategy (CSS) The major players in active learning and in perfect selective classiﬁcation are the CAL algorithm and the consistent selective strategy (CSS), respectively. To deﬁne them we need the following deﬁnitions. Deﬁnition 1 (Version space, Mitchell, 1977) Given an hypothesis class H and a training sample Sm , the version space V SH ,Sm is the set of all hypotheses in H that classify Sm correctly. Deﬁnition 2 (Disagreement set, Hanneke, 2007a; El-Yaniv and Wiener, 2010) Let G ⊂ H . The disagreement set w.r.t. G is deﬁned as DIS(G ) {x ∈ X : ∃h1 , h2 ∈ G The agreement set w.r.t. G is AGR(G ) s.t. h1 (x) = h2 (x)} . X \ DIS(G ). The main strategy for active learning in the realizable setting (Cohn et al., 1994) is to request labels only for instances belonging to the disagreement set and output any (consistent) hypothesis belonging to the version space. This strategy is often called the CAL algorithm. A related strategy for perfect selective classiﬁcation was proposed in El-Yaniv and Wiener (2010) and termed consistent selective strategy (CSS). Given a training set Sm , CSS takes the classiﬁer h to be any hypothesis in V SH ,Sm (i.e., a consistent learner), and takes a selection function g that equals one for all points in the agreement set with respect to V SH ,Sm , and zero otherwise. 3. From Coverage Bound to Label Complexity Bound In this section we present a reduction from stream-based active learning to perfect selective classiﬁcation. Particularly, we show that if there exists for H a perfect selective classiﬁer with a fast rejection rate of O(polylog(m)/m), then the CAL algorithm will actively learn H with exponential label complexity rate of O(polylog(1/ε)). Lemma 3 Let Sm = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xm , ym )} be a sequence of m labeled samples drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution P(X) and let Si = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xi , yi )} be the i-preﬁx of Sm . Then, with probability of at least 1 − δ over random choices of Sm , the following bound holds simultaneously for all i = 1, . . . , m − 1, Pr xi+1 ∈ DIS(V SH ,Si )|Si ≤ 1 − BΦ H , δ , 2⌊log2 (i)⌋ , log2 (m) where BΦ (H , δ, m) is a coverage bound for perfect selective classiﬁcation with respect to hypothesis class H , conﬁdence δ and sample size m . 259 E L -YANIV AND W IENER Proof For j = 1, . . . , m, abbreviate DIS j DIS(V SH ,S j ) and AGR j AGR(V SH ,S j ). By deﬁnition, DIS j = X \ AGR j . By the deﬁnitions of a coverage bound and agreement/disagreement sets, with probability of at least 1 − δ over random choices of S j BΦ (H , δ, j) ≤ Pr{x ∈ AGR j |S j } = Pr{x ∈ DIS j |S j } = 1 − Pr{x ∈ DIS j |S j }. Applying the union bound we conclude that the following inequality holds simultaneously with high probability for t = 0, . . . , ⌊log2 (m)⌋ − 1, Pr{x2t +1 ∈ DIS2t |S2t } ≤ 1 − BΦ H , δ , 2t . log2 (m) (1) For all j ≤ i, S j ⊆ Si , so DISi ⊆ DIS j . Therefore, since the samples in Sm are all drawn i.i.d., for any j ≤ i, Pr {xi+1 ∈ DISi |Si } ≤ Pr xi+1 ∈ DIS j |S j = Pr x j+1 ∈ DIS j |S j . The proof is complete by setting j = 2⌊log2 (i)⌋ ≤ i, and applying inequality (1). Lemma 4 (Bernstein’s inequality Hoeffding, 1963) Let X1 , . . . , Xn be independent zero-mean random variables.

Then, with probability of at least 1 − δ, m m 2 2 2 ∑ Zi ≤ ∑ bi + 2 ln δ ∑ bi + 3 ln δ . i=1 i=1 We proceed with a direct proof of Lemma 6. An alternative proof of this lemma, using supermartingales, appears in Appendix B. Proof For i = 1, . . . , m, let Wi be binary random variables satisfying bi + I(Pi ≤ bi ) · (Pi − bi ) , Pi bi − Pi ,0 , Pr{Wi = 1|Zi = 0, Xi−1 , . . . , X1 } max 1 − Pi Pr{Wi = 1|Wi−1 , . . . ,W1 , Xi−1 , . . . , X1 } = Pr{Wi = 1|Xi−1 , . . . , X1 }. Pr{Wi = 1|Zi = 1, Xi−1 , . . . , X1 } We notice that Pr{Wi = 1|Xi−1 , . . . , X1 } = Pr{Wi = 1, Zi = 1|Xi−1 , . . . , X1 } + Pr{Wi = 1, Zi = 0|Xi−1 , . . . , X1 } = Pr{Wi = 1|Zi = 1, Xi−1 , . . . , X1 } Pr{Zi = 1|Xi−1 , . . . , X1 } + Pr{Wi = 1|Zi = 0, Xi−1 , . . . , X1 } Pr{Zi = 0|Xi−1 , . . . , X1 } = Pi + bi −Pii (1 − Pi ) = bi , Pi ≤ bi ; 1−P bi · Pi + 0 = bi , else. Pi Hence the distribution of each Wi is independent of Xi−1 , . . . , X1 , and the Wi are independent Bernoulli random variables with success probabilities bi . By construction if Pi ≤ bi then Pr{Wi = 1|Zi = 1} = X Pr{Wi = 1|Zi = 1, Xi−1 , . . . , X1 } = 1. 1. Precisely we require that each of the bi were selected before Xi are chosen 261 E L -YANIV AND W IENER By assumption Pi ≤ bi for all i simultaneously with probability of at least 1−δ/2. Therefore, Zi ≤ Wi simultaneously with probability of at least 1 − δ/2. We now apply Lemma 5 on the Wi . The proof is then completed using the union bound. Theorem 7 Let Sm be a sequence of m unlabeled samples drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution P. Then with probability of at least 1 − δ over choices of Sm , the number of label requests k by the CAL algorithm is bounded by k ≤ Ψ(H , δ, m) + where Ψ(H , δ, m) 2 2 2 2 ln Ψ(H , δ, m) + ln , δ 3 δ m ∑ i=1 1 − BΦ H , δ , 2⌊log2 (i)⌋ 2 log2 (m) and BΦ (H , δ, m) is a coverage bound for perfect selective classiﬁcation with respect to hypothesis class H , conﬁdence δ and sample size m . Proof According to CAL, the label of sample xi will be requested iff xi ∈ DIS(V SH ,Si−1 ). For i = 1, . . . , m, let Zi be binary random variables such that Zi 1 iff CAL requests a label for sample xi . Applying Lemma 3 we get that for all i = 2, . . . , m, with probability of at least 1 − δ/2 Pr{Zi = 1|Si−1 } = Pr xi ∈ DIS(V SH ,Si−1 )|Si−1 ≤ 1 − BΦ H , δ , 2⌊log2 (i−1)⌋ . 2 log2 (m) For i = 1, BΦ (H , δ, 1) = 0 and the above inequality trivially holds. An application of Lemma 6 on the variables Zi completes the proof. Theorem 7 states an upper bound on the label complexity expressed in terms of m, the size of the sample provided to CAL. This upper bound is very convenient for directly analyzing the active learning speedup relative to supervised learning. A standard label complexity upper bound, which depends on 1/ε, can be extracted using the following simple observation. Lemma 8 (Hanneke, 2009; Anthony and Bartlett, 1999) Let Sm be a sequence of m unlabeled samples drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution P. Let H be a hypothesis class whose ﬁnite VC dimension is d, and let ε and δ be given. If m≥ 4 2 12 d ln + ln , ε ε δ then, with probability of at least 1 − δ, CAL will output a classiﬁer whose true error is at most ε. Proof Hanneke (2009) observed that since CAL requests a label whenever there is a disagreement in the version space, it is guaranteed that after processing m examples, CAL will output a classiﬁer that is consistent with all the m examples introduced to it. Therefore, CAL is a consistent learner. A classical result (Anthony and Bartlett, 1999, Theorem 4.8) is that any consistent learner will achieve, with probability of at least 1 − δ, a true error not exceeding ε after observing at most 12 2 4 ε d ln ε + ln δ labeled examples. 262 ACTIVE L EARNING VIA P ERFECT S ELECTIVE C LASSIFICATION Theorem 9 Let H be a hypothesis class whose ﬁnite VC dimension is d. If the rejection rate of CSS polylog( m ) δ (see deﬁnition in Section 2.3) is O , then (H , P) is actively learnable with exponential m label complexity speedup. Proof Plugging this rejection rate into Ψ (deﬁned in Theorem 7) we have,  m m polylog δ Ψ(H , δ, m) ∑ 1 − BΦ (H , , 2⌊log2 (i)⌋ ) = ∑ O  log2 (m) i i=1 i=1 Applying Lemma 41 we get Ψ(H , δ, m) = O polylog By Theorem 7, k = O polylog m δ m log(m) δ i log(m) δ  . . , and an application of Lemma 8 concludes the proof. 4. Label Complexity Bounding Technique and Its Applications In this section we present a novel technique for deriving target-independent label complexity bounds for active learning. The technique combines the reduction of Theorem 7 and a general datadependent coverage bound for selective classiﬁcation from El-Yaniv and Wiener (2010). For some learning problems it is a straightforward technical exercise, involving VC-dimension calculations, to arrive with exponential label complexity bounds. We show a few applications of this technique resulting in both reproductions of known label complexity exponential rates as well as a new one. The following deﬁnitions (El-Yaniv and Wiener, 2010) are required for introducing the technique. Deﬁnition 10 (Version space compression set) For any hypothesis class H , let Sm be a labeled sample of m points inducing a version space V SH ,Sm . The version space compression set, S′ ⊆ Sm , ˆ ˆ is a smallest subset of Sm satisfying V SH ,Sm = V SH ,S′ . The (unique) number n = n(H , Sm ) = |S′ | is called the version space compression set size. Remark 11 Our ”version space compression set” is precisely Hanneke’s ”minimum specifying set” (Hanneke, 2007b) for f on U with respect to V , where, f = h∗ , U = Sm , V = H [Sm ] (see Deﬁnition 23). Deﬁnition 12 (Characterizing hypothesis) For any subset of hypotheses G ⊆ H , the characterizing hypothesis of G , denoted fG (x), is a binary hypothesis over X (not restricted to H ) obtaining positive values over the agreement set AGR(G ) (Deﬁnition 2), and zero otherwise. Deﬁnition 13 (Order-n characterizing set) For each n, let Σn be the set of all possible labeled samples of size n (all n-subsets, each with all 2n possible labelings). The order-n characterizing set of H , denoted Fn , is the set of all characterizing hypotheses fG (x), where G ⊆ H is a version space induced by some member of Σn . 263 E L -YANIV AND W IENER Deﬁnition 14 (Characterizing set complexity) Let Fn be the order-n characterizing set of H . The order-n characterizing set complexity of H , denoted γ (H , n), is the VC-dimension of Fn . The following theorem, credited to (El-Yaniv and Wiener, 2010, Theorem 21), is a powerful data-dependent coverage bound for perfect selective learning, expressed in terms of the version space compression set size and the characterizing set complexity. Theorem 15 (Data-dependent coverage guarantee) For any m, let a1 , a2 , . . . , am ∈ R be given, such that ai ≥ 0 and ∑m ai ≤ 1. Let (h, g) be perfect selective classiﬁer (CSS, see Section 2.3). i=1 Then, R(h, g) = 0, and for any 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1, with probability of at least 1 − δ, Φ(h, g) ≥ 1 − 2 γ (H , n) ln+ ˆ m 2em 2 , + ln an δ γ (H , n) ˆ ˆ where n is the size of the version space compression set and γ (H , n) is the order-n characterizing ˆ ˆ ˆ set complexity of H . Given an hypothesis class H , our recipe to deriving active learning label complexity bounds for H is: (i) calculate both n and γ (H , n); (ii) apply Theorem 15, obtaining a bound BΦ for the ˆ ˆ coverage; (iii) plug BΦ in Theorem 7 to get a label complexity bound expressed as a summation; (iv) Apply Lemma 41 to obtain a label complexity bound in a closed form. 4.1 Examples In the following example we derive a label complexity bound for the concept class of thresholds (linear separators in R). Although this is a toy example (for which an exponential rate is well known) it does exemplify the technique, and in many other cases the application of the technique is not much harder. Let H be the class of thresholds. We ﬁrst show that the corresponding version space compression set size n ≤ 2. Assume w.l.o.g. that h∗ (x) I(x > w) for some w ∈ (0, 1). Let ˆ x− max{xi ∈ Sm |yi = −1} and x+ min(xi ∈ Sm |yi = +1). At least one of x− or x+ exist. Let ′ ′ Sm = {(x− , −1), (x+ , +1)}. Then V SH ,Sm = V SH ,Sm , and n = |Sm | ≤ 2. Now, γ (H , 2) = 2, because ˆ ′ the order-2 characterizing set of H is the class of intervals in R whose VC-dimension is 2. Plugging these numbers in Theorem 15, and using the assignment a1 = a2 = 1/2, BΦ (H , δ, m) = 1 − 2 4 ln (m/δ) 2 ln (em) + ln = 1−O . m δ m Next we plug BΦ in Theorem 7 obtaining a raw label complexity m Ψ(H , δ, m) = ∑ 1 − BΦ H , i=1 δ , 2⌊log2 (i)⌋ 2 log2 (m) m = ∑O i=1 ln (log2 (m) · i/δ) . i Finally, by applying Lemma 41, with a = 1 and b = log2 m/δ, we conclude that Ψ(H , δ, m) = O ln2 m δ . Thus, H is actively learnable with exponential speedup, and this result applies to any distribution. In Table 1 we summarize the n and γ (H , n) values we calculated for four other hypothesis classes.

We emphasize that ˆ the bounds for these two classes are target-dependent as they require that Sm include at least one sample from each class. 4.2 Linear Separators in Rd Under Mixture of Gaussians In this section we state and prove our main example, an exponential label complexity bound for linear classiﬁers in Rd . Theorem 16 Let H be the class of all linear binary classiﬁers in Rd , and let the underlying distribution be any mixture of a ﬁxed number of Gaussians in Rd . Then, with probability of at least 1 − δ over choices of Sm , the number of label requests k by CAL is bounded by 2 k=O (log m)d +1 δ(d+3)/2 . Therefore by Lemma 8 we get k = O (poly(1/δ) · polylog(1/ε)) . Proof The following is a coverage bound for linear classiﬁers in d dimensions that holds in our setting with probability of at least 1 − δ (El-Yaniv and Wiener, 2010, Corollary 33),3 2 Φ(h, g) ≥ 1 − O 1 (log m)d · (d+3)/2 m δ . (2) 2. Target-dependent with at least one sample in each class. 3. This bound uses the fact that for linear classiﬁers in d dimensions n = O (log m)d−1 /δ (El-Yaniv and Wiener, 2010, ˆ Lemma 32), and that γ (H , n) = O nd/2+1 (El-Yaniv and Wiener, 2010, Lemma 27). ˆ ˆ 265 E L -YANIV AND W IENER Plugging this bound in Theorem 7 we obtain, Ψ(H , δ, m) = m ∑ i=1 1 − BΦ H , m = ∑O i=1 = O δ , 2⌊log2 (i)⌋ 2 log2 (m) 2 log2 (m) (log i)d · i δ log2 (m) δ d+3 2 d+3 2 m (log(i))d ·∑ i i=1 2 . Finally, an application of Lemma 41 with a = d 2 and b = 1 completes the proof. 5. Lower Bound on Label Complexity In the previous section we have derived an upper bound on the label complexity of CAL for various classiﬁers and distributions. In the case of linear classiﬁers in Rd we have shown an exponential speed up in terms of 1/ε but also an exponential slow down in terms of the dimension d. In passive learning there is a linear dependency in the dimension while in our case (active learning using CAL) there is an exponential one. Is it an artifact of our bounding technique or a fundamental phenomenon? To answer this question we derive an asymptotic lower bound on the label complexity. We show that the exponential dependency in d is unavoidable (at least asymptotically) for every bounding technique when considering linear classiﬁer even under a single Gaussian (isotropic) distribution. The argument is obtained by the observation that CAL has to request a label to any point on the convex hull of a sample Sm . The bound is obtained using known results from probabilistic geometry, which bound the ﬁrst two moments of the number of vertices of a random polytope under the Gaussian distribution. Deﬁnition 17 (Gaussian polytope) Let X1 , ..., Xm be i.i.d. random points in Rd with common stan1 dard normal distribution (with zero mean and covariance matrix 2 Id ). A Gaussian polytope Pm is the convex hull of these random points. Denote by fk (Pm ) the number of k-faces in the Gaussian polytope Pm . Note that f0 (Pm ) is the number of vertices in Pm . The following two Theorems asymptotically bound the average and variance of fk (Pm ). Theorem 18 (Hug et al., 2004, Theorem 1.1) Let X1 , ..., Xm be i.i.d. random points in Rd with common standard normal distribution. Then E fk (Pm ) = c(k,d) (log m) d−1 2 · (1 + o(1)) as m → ∞, where c(k,d) is a constant depending only on k and d. 266 ACTIVE L EARNING VIA P ERFECT S ELECTIVE C LASSIFICATION Theorem 19 (Hug and Reitzner, 2005, Theorem 1.1) Let X1 , ..., Xm be i.i.d. random points in Rd with common standard normal distribution. Then there exists a positive constant cd , depending only on the dimension, such that d−1 Var ( fk (Pm )) ≤ cd (log m) 2 for all k ∈ {0, . . . , d − 1}. We can now use Chebyshev’s inequality to lower bound the number of vertices in Pm ( f0 (Pm )) with high probability. Theorem 20 Let X1 , ..., Xm be i.i.d. random points in Rd with common standard normal distribution and δ > 0 be given. Then with probability of at least 1 − δ, f0 (Pm ) ≥ cd (log m) d−1 2 d−1 cd ˜ − √ (log m) 4 δ · (1 + o(1)) as m → ∞, where cd and cd are constants depending only on d. ˜ Proof Using Chebyshev’s inequality (in the second inequality), as well as Theorem 19 we get Pr ( f0 (Pm ) > E f0 (Pm ) − t) = 1 − Pr ( f0 (Pm ) ≤ E f0 (Pm ) − t) ≥ 1 − Pr (| f0 (Pm ) − E f0 (Pm )| ≥ t) d−1 cd Var ( f0 (Pm )) ≥ 1 − 2 (log m) 2 . ≥ 1− 2 t t Equating the RHS to 1 − δ and solving for t we get t= (log m) cd δ d−1 2 . Applying Theorem 18 completes the proof. Theorem 21 (Lower bound) Let H be the class of linear binary classiﬁers in Rd , and let the underlying distribution be standard normal distribution in Rd . Then there exists a target hypothesis such that, with probability of at least 1 − δ over choices of Sm , the number of label requests k by CAL is bounded by d−1 cd k ≥ (log m) 2 · (1 + o(1)). 2 as m → ∞, where cd is a constant depending only on d. Proof Let us look at the Gaussian polytope Pm induced by the random sample Sm . As long as all labels requested by CAL have the same value (the case of minuscule minority class) we note that every vertex of Pm falls in the region of disagreement with respect to any subset of Sm that do not include that speciﬁc vertex. Therefore, CAL will request label at least for each vertex of Pm . For sufﬁciently large m, in particular, 4 2cd d−1 ˜ √ log m ≥ , cd δ we conclude the proof by applying Theorem 20. 267 E L -YANIV AND W IENER 6. Relation to Existing Label Complexity Measures A number of complexity measures to quantify the speedup in active learning have been proposed. In this section we show interesting relations between our techniques and two well known measures, namely the teaching dimension (Goldman and Kearns, 1995) and the disagreement coefﬁcient (Hanneke, 2009). Considering ﬁrst the teaching dimension, we prove in Lemma 26 that the version space compression set size is bounded above, with high probability, by the extended teaching dimension growth function (introduced by Hanneke, 2007b). Consequently, it follows that perfect selective classiﬁcation with meaningful coverage can be achieved for the case of axis-aligned rectangles under a product distribution. We then focus on Hanneke’s disagreement coefﬁcient and show in Theorem 34 that the coverage of CSS can be bounded below using the disagreement coefﬁcient. Conversely, in Corollary 39 we show that the disagreement coefﬁcient can be bounded above using any coverage bound for CSS. Consequently, the results here imply that the disagreement coefﬁcient, θ(ε) grows slowly with 1/ε for the case of linear classiﬁers under a mixture of Gaussians. 6.1 Teaching Dimension The teaching dimension is a label complexity measure proposed by Goldman and Kearns (1995). The dimension of the hypothesis class H is the minimum number of examples required to present to any consistent learner in order to uniquely identify any hypothesis in the class. We now deﬁne the following variation of the extended teaching dimension (Heged¨ s, 1995) u due to Hanneke. Throughout we use the notation h1 (S) = h2 (S) to denote the fact that the two hypotheses agree on the classiﬁcation of all instances in S. ¨ Deﬁnition 22 (Extended Teaching Dimension, Hegedus, 1995; Hanneke, 2007b) Let V ⊆ H , m ≥ m, 0, U ∈ X ∀f ∈ H , XT D( f ,V,U) = inf {t | ∃R ⊆ U : | {h ∈ V : h(R) = f (R)} | ≤ 1 ∧ |R| ≤ t} . Deﬁnition 23 (Hanneke, 2007b) For V ⊆ H , V [Sm ] denotes any subset of V such that ∀h ∈ V, | h′ ∈ V [Sm ] : h′ (Sm ) = h(Sm ) | = 1. Claim 24 Let Sm be a sample of size m, H an hypothesis class, and n = n(H , Sm ), the version space ˆ compression set size. Then, XT D(h∗ , H [Sm ], Sm ) = n. ˆ Proof Let Sn ⊆ Sm be a version space compression set. Assume, by contradiction, that there exist ˆ two hypotheses h1 , h2 ∈ H [Sm ], each of which agrees on the given classiﬁcations of all examples in Sn . Therefore, h1 , h2 ∈ V SH ,Sn , and by the deﬁnition of version space compression set, we get ˆ ˆ h1 , h2 ∈ V SH ,Sm . Hence, | h ∈ H [Sm ] : h(Sm ) = h∗ (Sm ) | ≥ 2, which contradicts deﬁnition 23. Therefore, | h ∈ H [Sm ] : h(Sn ) = h∗ (Sn ) | ≤ 1, ˆ ˆ 268 ACTIVE L EARNING VIA P ERFECT S ELECTIVE C LASSIFICATION and XT D(h∗ , H [Sm ], Sm ) ≤ |Sn | = n. ˆ ˆ Let R ⊂ Sm be any subset of size |R| < n. Consequently, V SH ,Sm ⊂ V SH ,R , and there exist hypothesis, ˆ ′ ∈ VS h H ,R , that agrees with all labeled examples in R, but disagrees with at least one example in Sm . Thus, h′ (Sm ) = h∗ (Sm ), and according to deﬁnition 23, there exist hypotheses h1 , h2 ∈ H [Sm ] such that h1 (Sm ) = h′ (Sm ) = h∗ (Sm ) = h2 (Sm ). But h1 (R) = h2 (R) = h∗ (R), so | {h ∈ V [Sm ] : h(R) = h∗ (R)} | ≥ 2. It follows that XT D(h∗ , H [Sm ], Sm ) ≥ n. ˆ Deﬁnition 25 (XTD Growth Function, Hanneke, 2007b) For m ≥ 0, V ⊆ H , δ ∈ [0, 1], XT D(V, P, m, δ) = inf t|∀h ∈ H , Pr {XT D(h,V [Sm ], Sm ) > t} ≤ δ . Lemma 26 Let H be an hypothesis class, P an unknown distribution, and δ > 0. Then, with probability of at least 1 − δ, n ≤ XT D(H , P, m, δ). ˆ Proof According to Deﬁnition 25, with probability of at least 1 − δ, XT D(h∗ , H [Sm ], Sm ) ≤ XT D(H , P, m, δ). Applying Claim 24 completes the proof. Lemma 27 (Balanced Axis-Aligned Rectangles, Hanneke, 2007b, Lemma 4) If P is a product distribution on Rd with continuous CDF, and H is the set of axis-aligned rectangles such that ∀h ∈ H , PrX∼P {h(X) = +1} ≥ λ, then, XT D(H , P, m, δ) ≤ O d2 dm log . λ δ Lemma 28 Blumer et al., 1989, Lemma 3.2.3 Let F be a binary hypothesis class of ﬁnite VC dimension d ≥ 1. For all k ≥ 1, deﬁne the k-fold union, Fk∪ Then, for all k ≥ 1, ∪k f i : f i ∈ F , 1 ≤ i ≤ k . i=1 VC(Fk∪ ) ≤ 2dk log2 (3k). Lemma 29 (order-n characterizing set complexity) Let H be the class of axis-aligned rectangles in Rd . Then, γ(H , n) ≤ O (dn log n) . 269 E L -YANIV AND W IENER − + Proof Let Sn = Sk ∪ Sn−k be a sample of size n composed of k negative examples, {x1 , x2 , . . . xk }, and n − k positive ones. Let H be the class of axis-aligned rectangles. We deﬁne, ∀1 ≤ i ≤ k, + Sn−k ∪ {(xi , −1)} . Ri Notice that V SH ,Ri includes all axis aligned rectangles that classify all samples in S+ as positive, and xi as negative. Therefore, the agreement region of V SH ,Ri is composed of two components as depicted in Figure 1. The ﬁrst component is the smallest rectangle that bounds the positive samples, and the second is an unbounded convex polytope deﬁned by up to d hyperplanes intersecting at xi . Let AGRi be the agreement region of V SH ,Ri and AGR the agreement region of V SH ,Sn . Clearly, Ri ⊆ Sn , so V SH ,Sn ⊆ V SH ,Ri , and AGRi ⊆ AGR, and it follows that k i=1 AGRi ⊆ AGR. Assume, by contradiction, that x ∈ AGR but x ∈ k AGRi . Therefore, for any 1 ≤ i ≤ k, there exist i=1 (i) (i) (i) (i) two hypotheses h1 , h2 ∈ V SH ,Ri , such that, h1 (x) = h2 (x). Assume, without loss of generality, (i) that h1 (x) = 1. We deﬁne k h1 (i) h1 k and (i) h2 , h2 i=1 i=1 (i) meaning that h1 classiﬁes a sample as positive if and only if all hypotheses h1 classify it as positive. Noting that the intersection of axis-aligned rectangles is itself an axis-aligned rectangle, we know (i) (i) that h1 , h2 ∈ H . Moreover, for any xi we have, h1 (xi ) = h2 (xi ) = −1, so also h1 (xi ) = h2 (xi ) = −1, and h1 , h2 ∈ V SH ,Sn . But h1 (x) = h2 (x). Contradiction. Therefore, k AGRi . AGR = i=1 It is well known that the VC dimension of a hyper-rectangle in Rd is 2d. The VC dimension of AGRi is bounded by the VC dimension of the union of two hyper-rectangles in Rd . Furthermore, the VC dimension of AGR is bounded by the VC dimension of the union of all AGRi . Applying Lemma 28 twice we get, VCdim {AGR} ≤ 42dk log2 (3k) ≤ 42dn log2 (3n). If k = 0 then the entire sample is positive and the region of agreement is an hyper-rectangle. Therefore, VCdim {AGR} = 2d. If k = n then the entire sample is negative and the region of agreement is the points of the samples themselves. Hence, VCdim {AGR} = n. Overall we get that in all cases, VCdim {AGR} ≤ 42dn log2 (3n) = O (dn log n) . 270 ACTIVE L EARNING VIA P ERFECT S ELECTIVE C LASSIFICATION Figure 1: Agreement region of V SH ,Ri . Corollary 30 (Balanced Axis-Aligned Rectangles) Under the same conditions of Lemma 27, the class of balanced axis-aligned rectangles in Rd can be perfectly selectively learned with fast coverage rate. Proof Applying Lemmas 26 and 27 we get that with probability of at least 1 − δ, dm d2 log . λ δ n≤O ˆ Any balanced axis-aligned rectangle belongs to the class of all axis-aligned rectangles. Therefore, the coverage of CSS for the class of balanced axis-aligned rectangles is bounded bellow by the coverage of the class of axis-aligned rectangles.

We begin by deﬁning, for an hypothesis h ∈ H , the set of all hypotheses that are r-close to h. Deﬁnition 31 (Hanneke, 2011b, p.337) For any hypothesis h ∈ H , distribution P over X , and r > 0, deﬁne the set B(h, r) of all hypotheses that reside in a ball of radius r around h, B(h, r) h′ ∈ H : Pr X∼P h′ (X) = h(X) ≤ r . Theorem 32 (Vapnik and Chervonenkis, 1971; Anthony and Bartlett, 1999, p.53) Let H be a hypothesis class with VC-dimension d. For any probability distribution P on X × {±1}, with probability of at least 1 − δ over the choice of Sm , any hypothesis h ∈ H consistent with Sm satisﬁes R(h) ≤ η(d, m, δ) 2 2em 2 + ln . d ln m d δ 271 E L -YANIV AND W IENER For any G ⊆ H and distribution P we denote by ∆G the volume of the disagreement region of G, ∆G Pr {DIS(G)} . Deﬁnition 33 (Disagreement coefﬁcient, Hanneke, 2009) Let ε ≥ 0. The disagreement coefﬁcient of the hypothesis class H with respect to the target distribution P is θ(ε) θh∗ (ε) = sup r>ε ∆B(h∗ , r) . r The following theorem formulates an intimate relation between active learning (disagreement coefﬁcient) and selective classiﬁcation. Theorem 34 Let H be an hypothesis class with VC-dimension d, P an unknown distribution, ε ≥ 0, and θ(ε), the corresponding disagreement coefﬁcient. Let (h, g) be a perfect selective classiﬁer (CSS, see Section 2.3). Then, R(h, g) = 0, and for any 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1, with probability of at least 1 − δ, Φ(h, g) ≥ 1 − θ(ε) · max {η(d, m, δ), ε} . Proof Clearly, R(h, g) = 0, and it remains to prove the coverage bound. By Theorem 32, with probability of at least 1 − δ, ∀h ∈ V SH ,Sm R(h) ≤ η(d, m, δ) ≤ max {η(d, m, δ), ε} . Therefore, V SH ,Sm ⊆ B (h∗ , max {η(d, m, δ), ε}) , ∆V SH ,Sm ≤ ∆B (h∗ , max {η(d, m, δ), ε}) . By Deﬁnition 33, for any r′ > ε, ∆B(h∗ , r′ ) ≤ θ(ε)r′ . Thus, the proof is complete by recalling that Φ(h, g) = 1 − ∆V SH ,Sm . Theorem 34 tells us that whenever our learning problem (speciﬁed by the pair (H , P)) has a disagreement coefﬁcient that grows slowly with respect to 1/ε , it can be (perfectly) selectively learned with a “fast” coverage bound. Consequently, through Theorem 9 we also know that in each case where there exists a disagreement coefﬁcient that grows slowly with respect to 1/ε, active learning with a fast rate can also be deduced directly through a reduction from perfect selective classiﬁcation. It follows that as far as fast rates in active learning are concerned, whatever can be accomplished by bounding the disagreement coefﬁcient, can be accomplished also using perfect selective classiﬁcation. This result is summarized in the following corollary. Corollary 35 Let H be an hypothesis class with VC-dimension d, P an unknown distribution, and θ(ε), the corresponding disagreement coefﬁcient. If θ(ε) = O(polylog(1/ε)), there exists a coverage bound such that an application of Theorem 7 ensures that (H , P) is actively learnable with exponential label complexity speedup. 272 ACTIVE L EARNING VIA P ERFECT S ELECTIVE C LASSIFICATION Proof The proof is established by straightforward applications of Theorems 34 with ε = 1/m and 9. The following result, due to Hanneke (2011a), implies a coverage upper bound for CSS. Lemma 36 (Hanneke, 2011a, Proof of Lemma 47) Let H be an hypothesis class, P an unknown distribution, and r ∈ (0, 1). Then, EP ∆Dm ≥ (1 − r)m ∆B (h∗ , r) , where Dm V SH ,Sm ∩ B (h∗ , r) . (3) Theorem 37 (Coverage upper bound) Let H be an hypothesis class, P an unknown distribution, and δ ∈ (0, 1). Then, for any r ∈ (0, 1), 1 > α > δ, BΦ (H , δ, m) ≤ 1 − where BΦ (H , δ, m) is any coverage bound. (1 − r)m − α ∆B (h∗ , r) , 1−α Proof Recalling the deﬁnition of Dm (3), clearly Dm ⊆ V SH ,Sm and Dm ⊆ B(h∗ , r). These inclusions imply (respectively), by the deﬁnition of disagreement set, ∆Dm ≤ ∆V SH ,Sm , and ∆Dm ≤ ∆B(h∗ , r). (4) Using Markov’s inequality (in inequality (5) of the following derivation) and applying (4) (in equality (6)), we thus have, (1 − r)m − α (1 − r)m − α ∆B (h∗ , r) ≤ Pr ∆Dm ≤ ∆B (h∗ , r) 1−α 1−α 1 − (1 − r)m Pr ∆B (h∗ , r) − ∆Dm ≥ ∆B (h∗ , r) 1−α 1 − (1 − r)m Pr |∆B (h∗ , r) − ∆Dm | ≥ ∆B (h∗ , r) 1−α E {|∆B (h∗ , r) − ∆Dm |} (1 − α) · (1 − (1 − r)m ) ∆B (h∗ , r) ∆B (h∗ , r) − E∆Dm . (1 − α) · (1 − (1 − r)m ) ∆B (h∗ , r) Pr ∆V SH ,Sm ≤ = ≤ ≤ = Applying Lemma 36 we therefore obtain, ≤ (1 − α) · ∆B (h∗ , r) − (1 − r)m ∆B(h∗ , r) = 1 − α < 1 − δ. (1 − (1 − r)m ) ∆B (h∗ , r) Observing that for any coverage bound, Pr ∆V SH ,Sm ≤ 1 − BΦ (H , δ, m) ≥ 1 − δ, completes the proof. 273 (5) (6) E L -YANIV AND W IENER Corollary 38 Let H be an hypothesis class, P an unknown distribution, and δ ∈ (0, 1/8). Then for any m ≥ 2, 1 1 , BΦ (H , δ, m) ≤ 1 − ∆B h∗ , 7 m where BΦ (H , δ, m) is any coverage bound. Proof The proof is established by a straightforward application of Theorem 37 with α = 1/8 and r = 1/m. With Corollary 38 we can bound the disagreement coefﬁcient for settings whose coverage bound is known. Corollary 39 Let H be an hypothesis class, P an unknown distribution, and BΦ (H , δ, m) a coverage bound. Then the disagreement coefﬁcient is bounded by, θ(ε) ≤ max sup 7 · r∈(ε,1/2) 1 − BΦ (H , 1/9, ⌊1/r⌋) ,2 . r Proof Applying Corollary 38 we get that for any r ∈ (0, 1/2), 1 − BΦ (H , 1/9, ⌊1/r⌋) ∆B(h∗ , r) ∆B(h∗ , 1/⌊1/r⌋) ≤ ≤ 7· . r r r Therefore, θ(ε) = sup r>ε ∆B(h∗ , r) ≤ max r sup 7 · r∈(ε,1/2) 1 − BΦ (H , 1/9, ⌊1/r⌋) ,2 . r Corollary 40 Let H be the class of all linear binary classiﬁers in Rd , and let the underlying distribution be any mixture of a ﬁxed number of Gaussians in Rd .

ACTIVE L EARNING VIA P ERFECT S ELECTIVE C LASSIFICATION 7. Concluding Remarks For quite a few years, since its inception, the theory of target-independent bounds for noise-free active learning managed to handle relatively simple settings, mostly revolving around homogeneous linear classiﬁers under the uniform distribution over the sphere. It is likely that this distributional uniformity assumption was often adapted to simplify analyses. However, it was shown by Dasgupta (2005) that under this distribution, exponential speed up cannot be achieved when considering general (non homogeneous) linear classiﬁers. The reason for this behavior is related to the two tasks that a good active learner should successfully accomplish: exploration and exploitation. Intuitively (and oversimplifying things) exploration is the task of obtaining at least one sample in each class, and exploitation is the process of reﬁning the decision boundary by requesting labels of points around the boundary. Dasgupta showed that exploration cannot be achieved fast enough under the uniform distribution on the sphere. The source of this difﬁculty is the fact that under this distribution all training points reside on their convex hull. In general, the speed of exploration (using linear classiﬁers) depends on the size (number of vertices) of the convex hull of the training set. When using homogeneous linear classiﬁers, exploration is trivially achieved (under the uniform distribution) and exploitation can achieve exponential speedup. So why in the non-veriﬁable model (Balcan et al., 2008) it is possible to achieve exponential speedup even when using non homogeneous linear classiﬁers under the uniform distribution? The answer is that in the non-veriﬁable model, label complexity attributed to exploration is encapsulated in a target-dependent “constant.” Speciﬁcally, in Balcan et al. (2008) this constant is explicitly deﬁned to be the probability mass of the minority class. Indeed, in certain noise free settings using linear classiﬁers, where the minority class is large enough, exploration is a non issue. In general, however, exploration is a major bottleneck in practical active learning (Baram et al., 2004; Begleiter et al., 2008). The present results show how exponential speedup can be achieved, including exploration, when using different (and perhaps more natural) distributions. With these good news, a somewhat pessimistic picture arises from the lower bound we obtained for the exponential dependency on the dimension d. This negative result is not restricted to streambased active learning and readily applies also to the pool-based model. While the bound is only asymptotic, we conjecture that it also holds for ﬁnite samples. Moreover, we believe that within the stream- or pool-based settings a similar statement should hold true for any active learning method (and not necessarily CAL-based querying strategies). This result indicates that when performing noise free active learning of linear classiﬁers, aggressive feature selection is beneﬁcial for exploration speedup. We note, however, that it remains open whether a slowdown exponent of d (rather than d 2 ) is achievable. We have exposed interesting relations of the present technique to well known complexity measures for active learning, namely, the teaching dimension and the disagreement coefﬁcient. These developments were facilitated by observations made by Hanneke on the teaching dimension and the disagreement coefﬁcient. These relations gave rise to further observations on active learning, which are discussed in Section 6 and include exponential speedup for balanced axis-aligned rectangles. Finally, we note that the intimate relation between selective classiﬁcation and the disagreement coefﬁcient was recently exposed in another result for selective classiﬁcation where the disagreement coefﬁcient emerged as a dominating factor in a coverage bound for agnostic selective classiﬁcation (El-Yaniv and Wiener, 2011). 275 E L -YANIV AND W IENER Acknowledgments We thank the anonymous reviewers for their good comments.

(7) Therefore, if m < ea − 1 we have, m ∑ i=1 m f (i) = lna (b) + ∑ f (i) < 2 · i=2 m+1 x=1 f (x)dx ≤ 2 lna+1 (b(m + 1)). a+1 Otherwise, m ≥ ea /b, in which case we overcome the change of slope by adding twice the (upper bound on the) maximal value (7), m ∑ f (i) < i=1 ≤ 2 2 2 lna+1 (b(m + 1)) + 2aa = lna+1 (b(m + 1)) + aa+1 a+1 a+1 a 2 4 2 lna+1 (b(m + 1)) + lna+1 bm ≤ lna+1 (b(m + 1)). a+1 a a 276 ACTIVE L EARNING VIA P ERFECT S ELECTIVE C LASSIFICATION Appendix B. Alternative Proof of Lemma 6 Using Super Martingales Deﬁne Wk ∑k (Zi − bi ). We assume that with probability of at least 1 − δ/2, i=1 Pr{Zi |Z1 , . . . , Zi−1 } ≤ bi , simultaneously for all i. Since Zi is a binary random variable it is easy to see that (w.h.p.), EZi {Wi |Z1 , . . . , Zi−1 } = Pr{Zi |Z1 , . . . , Zi−1 } − bi +Wi−1 ≤ Wi−1 , and the sequence W1m W1 , . . . ,Wm is a super-martingale with high probability. We apply the following theorem by McDiarmid that refers to martingales (but can be shown to apply to supermartingales, by following its original proof). Theorem 42 (McDiarmid, 1998, Theorem 3.12) Let Y1 , . . . ,Yn be a martingale difference sequence with −ak ≤ Yk ≤ 1 − ak for each k; let A = 1 ∑ ak . Then, for any ε > 0, n Pr ∑ Yk ≥ Anε ≤ exp (−[(1 + ε) ln(1 + ε) − ε]An) ≤ exp − Anε2 . 2(1 + ε/3) In our case, Yk = Wk −Wk−1 = Zk − bk ≤ 1 − bk and we apply the (revised) theorem with ak and An ∑ bk B. We thus obtain, for any 0 < ε < 1, Pr ∑ Zk ≥ B + Bε ≤ exp − bk Bε2 . 2(1 + ε/3) Equating the right-hand side to δ/2, we obtain ε = 2 2 ln ± 3 δ 4 22 2 ln + 8B ln 9 δ δ ≤ 1 2 ln + 3 δ 1 22 ln + 9 δ = 2 2 ln + 3 δ 2B ln 2 δ 2B ln /2B 2 δ /B /B. Applying the union bound completes the proof. References M. Anthony and P.L. Bartlett. Neural Network Learning; Theoretical Foundations. Cambridge University Press, 1999. L. Atlas, D. Cohn, R.

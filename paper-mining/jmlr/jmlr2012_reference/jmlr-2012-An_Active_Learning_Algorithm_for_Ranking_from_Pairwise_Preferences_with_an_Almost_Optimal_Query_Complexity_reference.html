The goal is to linearly order the elements while disagreeing with as few pairwise preference labels as possible. Our performance is measured by two parameters: The number of disagreements (loss) and the query complexity (number of pairwise preference labels). Our algorithm adaptively queries at most O(ε−6 n log5 n) preference labels for a regret of ε times the optimal loss. As a function of n, this is asymptotically better than standard (non-adaptive) learning bounds achievable for the same problem. Our main result takes us a step closer toward settling an open problem posed by learning-torank (from pairwise information) theoreticians and practitioners: What is a provably correct way to sample preference labels? To further show the power and practicality of our solution, we analyze a typical test case in which a large margin linear relaxation is used for efﬁciently solving the simpler learning problems in our decomposition. Keywords: statistical learning theory, active learning, ranking, pairwise ranking, preferences</p><br/>

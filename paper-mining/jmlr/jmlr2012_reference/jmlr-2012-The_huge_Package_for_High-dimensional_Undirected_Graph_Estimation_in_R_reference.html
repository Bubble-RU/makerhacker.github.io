<h1>113 jmlr-2012-The huge Package for High-dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation in R</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2012-113-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume13/zhao12a/zhao12a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Tuo Zhao, Han Liu, Kathryn Roeder, John Lafferty, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: We describe an R package named huge which provides easy-to-use functions for estimating high dimensional undirected graphs from data. This package implements recent results in the literature, including Friedman et al. (2007), Liu et al. (2009, 2012) and Liu et al. (2010). Compared with the existing graph estimation package glasso, the huge package provides extra features: (1) instead of using Fortan, it is written in C, which makes the code more portable and easier to modify; (2) besides ﬁtting Gaussian graphical models, it also provides functions for ﬁtting high dimensional semiparametric Gaussian copula models; (3) more functions like data-dependent model selection, data generation and graph visualization; (4) a minor convergence problem of the graphical lasso algorithm is corrected; (5) the package allows the user to apply both lossless and lossy screening rules to scale up large-scale problems, making a tradeoff between computational and statistical efﬁciency. Keywords: high-dimensional undirected graph estimation, glasso, huge, semiparametric graph estimation, data-dependent model selection, lossless screening, lossy screening 1. Overview Undirected graphs is a natural approach to describe the conditional independence among many variables. Each node of the graph represents a single variable and no edge between two variables implies that they are conditional independent given all other variables. In the past decade, significant progress has been made on designing efﬁcient algorithms to learn undirected graphs from high-dimensional observational data sets. Most of these methods are based on either the penalized maximum-likelihood estimation (Friedman et al., 2007) or penalized regression methods (Meinshausen and B¨ hlmann, 2006). Existing packages include glasso, Covpath and CLIME. In particuu ∗. Also in the Department of Biostatistics. †.

Z HAO , L IU , ROEDER , L AFFERTY AND WASSERMAN lar, the glasso package has been widely adopted by statisticians and computer scientists due to its friendly user-inference and efﬁciency. In this paper1 we describe a newly developed R package named huge (High-dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation) coded in C. The package includes a wide range of functional modules and addresses some drawbacks of the graphical lasso algorithm. To gain more scalability, the package supports two modes of screening, lossless (Witten et al., 2011) and lossy screening. When using lossy screening, the user can select the desired screening level to scale up for high-dimensional problems, but this introduces some estimation bias. 2. Software Design and Implementation The package huge aims to provide a general framework for high-dimensional undirected graph estimation. The package includes Six functional modules (M1-M6) facilitate a ﬂexible pipeline for analysis (Figure 1). M1. Data Generator: The function huge.generator() can simulate multivariate Gaussian data with different undirected graphs, including hub, cluster, band, scale-free, and Erd¨ s-R´ nyi o e random graphs. The sparsity level of the obtained graph and signal-to-noise ratio can also be set up by users. M2. Semiparametric Transformation: The function huge.npn() implements the nonparanormal method (Liu et al., 2009, 2012) for estimating a semiparametric Gaussian copula model.The nonparanormal family extends the Gaussian distribution by marginally transforming the variables. Computationally, the nonparanormal transformation only requires one pass through the data matrix. M3. Graph Screening: The scr argument in the main function huge() controls the use of largescale correlation screening before graph estimation. The function supports the lossless screening (Witten et al., 2011) and the lossy screening. Such screening procedures can greatly reduce the computational cost and achieve equal or even better estimation by reducing the variance at the expense of increased bias.

Graph Estimation: Similar to the glasso package, the method argument in the huge() function supports two estimation methods: (i) the neighborhood pursuit algorithm (Meinshausen and B¨ hlmann, 2006) and (ii) the graphical lasso algorithm (Friedman et al., 2007). We apply u the coordinate descent with active set and covariance update, as well as other tricks suggested in Friedman et al. (2010). We modiﬁed the warm start trick to address the potential divergence problem of the graphical lasso algorithm (Mazumder and Hastie, 2011). The code is also memory-optimized using the sparse matrix data structure when estimating and storing full regularization paths for large 1. This paper is only a summary of the package huge.

M5. Model Selection: The function huge.select() provides two regularization parameter selection methods: the stability approach for regularization selection (StARS) (Liu et al., 2010); and rotation information criterion (RIC). We also provide a likelihood-based extended Bayesian information criterion. M6. Graph Visualization: The plotting functions huge.plot() and plot() provide visualizations of the simulated data sets, estimated graphs and paths. The implementation is based on the igraph package. 3. User Interface by Example We illustrate the user interface by analyzing a stock market data which we contribute to the huge package. We acquired closing prices from all stocks in the S&P; 500 for all the days that the market was open between Jan 1, 2003 and Jan 1, 2008. This gave us 1258 samples for the 452 stocks that remained in the S&P; 500 during the entire time period. > > > > > library(huge) data(stockdata) # Load the data x = log(stockdata$data[2:1258,]/stockdata$data[1:1257,]) # Preprocessing x.npn = huge.npn(x, npn.func=</p><br/>

<p>Author: Mikhail Belkin, Partha Niyogi, Vikas Sindhwani</p><p>Abstract: We propose a family of learning algorithms based on a new form of regularization that allows us to exploit the geometry of the marginal distribution. We focus on a semi-supervised framework that incorporates labeled and unlabeled data in a general-purpose learner. Some transductive graph learning algorithms and standard methods including support vector machines and regularized least squares can be obtained as special cases. We use properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to prove new Representer theorems that provide theoretical basis for the algorithms. As a result (in contrast to purely graph-based approaches) we obtain a natural out-of-sample extension to novel examples and so are able to handle both transductive and truly semi-supervised settings. We present experimental evidence suggesting that our semi-supervised algorithms are able to use unlabeled data effectively. Finally we have a brief discussion of unsupervised and fully supervised learning within our general framework.

<p>Author: Mingrui Wu, Bernhard Schölkopf, Gökhan Bakır</p><p>Abstract: Many kernel learning algorithms, including support vector machines, result in a kernel machine, such as a kernel classiﬁer, whose key component is a weight vector in a feature space implicitly introduced by a positive deﬁnite kernel function. This weight vector is usually obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Based on this fact we present a direct method to build sparse kernel learning algorithms by adding one more constraint to the original convex optimization problem, such that the sparseness of the resulting kernel machine is explicitly controlled while at the same time performance is kept as high as possible. A gradient based approach is provided to solve this modiﬁed optimization problem. Applying this method to the support vectom machine results in a concrete algorithm for building sparse large margin classiﬁers. These classiﬁers essentially ﬁnd a discriminating subspace that can be spanned by a small number of vectors, and in this subspace, the diﬀerent classes of data are linearly well separated. Experimental results over several classiﬁcation benchmarks demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our approach.

<p>Author: Ross A. Lippert, Ryan M. Rifkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of Tikhonov regularization with a general convex loss function: this formalism includes support vector machines and regularized least squares. For a family of kernels that includes the Gaussian, parameterized by a “bandwidth” parameter σ, we characterize the limiting ˜ solution as σ → ∞. In particular, we show that if we set the regularization parameter λ = λσ−2p , the regularization term of the Tikhonov problem tends to an indicator function on polynomials of degree ⌊p⌋ (with residual regularization in the case where p ∈ Z). The proof rests on two key ideas: epi-convergence, a notion of functional convergence under which limits of minimizers converge to minimizers of limits, and a value-based formulation of learning, where we work with regularization on the function output values (y) as opposed to the function expansion coefﬁcients in the RKHS. Our result generalizes and uniﬁes previous results in this area.

<p>Author: Pannagadatta K. Shivaswamy, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Alexander J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel second order cone programming formulation for designing robust classiﬁers which can handle uncertainty in observations. Similar formulations are also derived for designing regression functions which are robust to uncertainties in the regression setting. The proposed formulations are independent of the underlying distribution, requiring only the existence of second order moments. These formulations are then specialized to the case of missing values in observations for both classiﬁcation and regression problems. Experiments show that the proposed formulations outperform imputation.</p><p>4 0.74891359 <a title="29-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2006-Exact_1-Norm_Support_Vector_Machines_Via_Unconstrained_Convex_Differentiable_Minimization_%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%28Special_Topic_on_Machine_Learning_and_Optimization%29.html">31 jmlr-2006-Exact 1-Norm Support Vector Machines Via Unconstrained Convex Differentiable Minimization     (Special Topic on Machine Learning and Optimization)</a></p>
<p>Author: Olvi L. Mangasarian</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines utilizing the 1-norm, typically set up as linear programs (Mangasarian, 2000; Bradley and Mangasarian, 1998), are formulated here as a completely unconstrained minimization of a convex differentiable piecewise-quadratic objective function in the dual space. The objective function, which has a Lipschitz continuous gradient and contains only one additional ﬁnite parameter, can be minimized by a generalized Newton method and leads to an exact solution of the support vector machine problem. The approach here is based on a formulation of a very general linear program as an unconstrained minimization problem and its application to support vector machine classiﬁcation problems. The present approach which generalizes both (Mangasarian, 2004) and (Fung and Mangasarian, 2004) is also applied to nonlinear approximation where a minimal number of nonlinear kernel functions are utilized to approximate a function from a given number of function values.</p><p>5 0.66998047 <a title="29-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2006-Manifold__Regularization%3A_A_Geometric_Framework_for_Learning_from_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Examples.html">60 jmlr-2006-Manifold  Regularization: A Geometric Framework for Learning from Labeled and Unlabeled Examples</a></p>
<p>Author: Mikhail Belkin, Partha Niyogi, Vikas Sindhwani</p><p>Abstract: We propose a family of learning algorithms based on a new form of regularization that allows us to exploit the geometry of the marginal distribution. We focus on a semi-supervised framework that incorporates labeled and unlabeled data in a general-purpose learner. Some transductive graph learning algorithms and standard methods including support vector machines and regularized least squares can be obtained as special cases. We use properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to prove new Representer theorems that provide theoretical basis for the algorithms. As a result (in contrast to purely graph-based approaches) we obtain a natural out-of-sample extension to novel examples and so are able to handle both transductive and truly semi-supervised settings. We present experimental evidence suggesting that our semi-supervised algorithms are able to use unlabeled data effectively. Finally we have a brief discussion of unsupervised and fully supervised learning within our general framework.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: In this work we consider the task of relaxing the i.i.d. assumption in pattern recognition (or classiﬁcation), aiming to make existing learning algorithms applicable to a wider range of tasks. Pattern recognition is guessing a discrete label of some object based on a set of given examples (pairs of objects and labels). We consider the case of deterministically deﬁned labels. Traditionally, this task is studied under the assumption that examples are independent and identically distributed. However, it turns out that many results of pattern recognition theory carry over a weaker assumption. Namely, under the assumption of conditional independence and identical distribution of objects, while the only assumption on the distribution of labels is that the rate of occurrence of each label should be above some positive threshold. We ﬁnd a broad class of learning algorithms for which estimations of the probability of the classiﬁcation error achieved under the classical i.i.d. assumption can be generalized to the similar estimates for case of conditionally i.i.d. examples.</p><p>3 0.074760601 <a title="36-tfidf-3" href="./jmlr-2006-Learning_Spectral_Clustering%2C_With_Application_To_Speech_Separation.html">52 jmlr-2006-Learning Spectral Clustering, With Application To Speech Separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering refers to a class of techniques which rely on the eigenstructure of a similarity matrix to partition points into disjoint clusters, with points in the same cluster having high similarity and points in different clusters having low similarity. In this paper, we derive new cost functions for spectral clustering based on measures of error between a given partition and a solution of the spectral relaxation of a minimum normalized cut problem. Minimizing these cost functions with respect to the partition leads to new spectral clustering algorithms. Minimizing with respect to the similarity matrix leads to algorithms for learning the similarity matrix from fully labelled data sets. We apply our learning algorithm to the blind one-microphone speech separation problem, casting the problem as one of segmentation of the spectrogram.

<p>Author: Shohei Shimizu, Patrik O. Hoyer, Aapo Hyvärinen, Antti Kerminen</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, several methods have been proposed for the discovery of causal structure from non-experimental data. Such methods make various assumptions on the data generating process to facilitate its identiﬁcation from purely observational data. Continuing this line of research, we show how to discover the complete causal structure of continuous-valued data, under the assumptions that (a) the data generating process is linear, (b) there are no unobserved confounders, and (c) disturbance variables have non-Gaussian distributions of non-zero variances. The solution relies on the use of the statistical method known as independent component analysis, and does not require any pre-speciﬁed time-ordering of the variables. We provide a complete Matlab package for performing this LiNGAM analysis (short for Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model), and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using artiﬁcially generated data and real-world data.

<p>Author: Mikhail Belkin, Partha Niyogi, Vikas Sindhwani</p><p>Abstract: We propose a family of learning algorithms based on a new form of regularization that allows us to exploit the geometry of the marginal distribution. We focus on a semi-supervised framework that incorporates labeled and unlabeled data in a general-purpose learner. Some transductive graph learning algorithms and standard methods including support vector machines and regularized least squares can be obtained as special cases. We use properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to prove new Representer theorems that provide theoretical basis for the algorithms. As a result (in contrast to purely graph-based approaches) we obtain a natural out-of-sample extension to novel examples and so are able to handle both transductive and truly semi-supervised settings. We present experimental evidence suggesting that our semi-supervised algorithms are able to use unlabeled data effectively. Finally we have a brief discussion of unsupervised and fully supervised learning within our general framework.

<p>Author: Ting Liu, Andrew W. Moore, Alexander Gray</p><p>Abstract: This paper is about non-approximate acceleration of high-dimensional nonparametric operations such as k nearest neighbor classiﬁers. We attempt to exploit the fact that even if we want exact answers to nonparametric queries, we usually do not need to explicitly ﬁnd the data points close to the query, but merely need to answer questions about the properties of that set of data points. This offers a small amount of computational leeway, and we investigate how much that leeway can be exploited. This is applicable to many algorithms in nonparametric statistics, memory-based learning and kernel-based learning. But for clarity, this paper concentrates on pure k-NN classiﬁcation. We introduce new ball-tree algorithms that on real-world data sets give accelerations from 2-fold to 100-fold compared against highly optimized traditional ball-tree-based k-NN . These results include data sets with up to 106 dimensions and 105 records, and demonstrate non-trivial speed-ups while giving exact answers. keywords: ball-tree, k-NN classiﬁcation</p><p>6 0.17590553 <a title="36-lsi-6" href="./jmlr-2006-Manifold__Regularization%3A_A_Geometric_Framework_for_Learning_from_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Examples.html">60 jmlr-2006-Manifold  Regularization: A Geometric Framework for Learning from Labeled and Unlabeled Examples</a></p>

By applying this operator to a family of different nonlinear functions, one obtains a family of different vectors lying in a vicinity of the target space. As a ﬁnal step, the target space itself is estimated by applying PCA to this family of vectors. We show that this procedure is consistent in the sense that the estimaton error tends to zero at a parametric rate, uniformly over the family, Numerical examples demonstrate the usefulness of our method.</p><p>2 0.47110057 <a title="36-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2006-Considering_Cost_Asymmetry_in_Learning_Classifiers.html">22 jmlr-2006-Considering Cost Asymmetry in Learning Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, David Heckerman, Eric Horvitz</p><p>Abstract: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are a standard way to display the performance of a set of binary classiﬁers for all feasible ratios of the costs associated with false positives and false negatives. For linear classiﬁers, the set of classiﬁers is typically obtained by training once, holding constant the estimated slope and then varying the intercept to obtain a parameterized set of classiﬁers whose performances can be plotted in the ROC plane. We consider the alternative of varying the asymmetry of the cost function used for training. We show that the ROC curve obtained by varying both the intercept and the asymmetry, and hence the slope, always outperforms the ROC curve obtained by varying only the intercept. In addition, we present a path-following algorithm for the support vector machine (SVM) that can compute efﬁciently the entire ROC curve, and that has the same computational complexity as training a single classiﬁer. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the asymmetric cost model assumed when training a classiﬁer and the cost model assumed in applying the classiﬁer. In particular, we show that the mismatch between the step function used for testing and its convex upper bounds, usually used for training, leads to a provable and quantiﬁable difference around extreme asymmetries.

<p>Author: Janez Demšar</p><p>Abstract: While methods for comparing two learning algorithms on a single data set have been scrutinized for quite some time already, the issue of statistical tests for comparisons of more algorithms on multiple data sets, which is even more essential to typical machine learning studies, has been all but ignored. This article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classiﬁers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classiﬁers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classiﬁers over multiple data sets. Results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD (critical difference) diagrams.

<p>Author: Luis M. de Campos</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new scoring function for learning Bayesian networks from data using score+search algorithms. This is based on the concept of mutual information and exploits some well-known properties of this measure in a novel way. Essentially, a statistical independence test based on the chi-square distribution, associated with the mutual information measure, together with a property of additive decomposition of this measure, are combined in order to measure the degree of interaction between each variable and its parent variables in the network. The result is a non-Bayesian scoring function called MIT (mutual information tests) which belongs to the family of scores based on information theory. The MIT score also represents a penalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probability distributions associated with a candidate network and with the available data set. Detailed results of a complete experimental evaluation of the proposed scoring function and its comparison with the well-known K2, BDeu and BIC/MDL scores are also presented.

<p>Author: Greg Hamerly, Erez Perelman, Jeremy Lau, Brad Calder, Timothy Sherwood</p><p>Abstract: An essential step in designing a new computer architecture is the careful examination of different design options. It is critical that computer architects have efﬁcient means by which they may estimate the impact of various design options on the overall machine. This task is complicated by the fact that different programs, and even different parts of the same program, may have distinct behaviors that interact with the hardware in different ways. Researchers use very detailed simulators to estimate processor performance, which models every cycle of an executing program. Unfortunately, simulating every cycle of a real program can take weeks or months. To address this problem we have created a tool called SimPoint that uses data clustering algorithms from machine learning to automatically ﬁnd repetitive patterns in a program’s execution. By simulating one representative of each repetitive behavior pattern, simulation time can be reduced to minutes instead of weeks for standard benchmark programs, with very little cost in terms of accuracy. We describe this important problem, the data representation and preprocessing methods used by SimPoint, the clustering algorithm at the core of SimPoint, and we evaluate different options for tuning SimPoint.

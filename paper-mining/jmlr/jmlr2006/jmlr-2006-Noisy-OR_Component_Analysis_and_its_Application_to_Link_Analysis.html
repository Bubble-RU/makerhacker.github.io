<p>Author: Rasmus Kongsgaard Olsson, Lars Kai Hansen</p><p>Abstract: We apply a type of generative modelling to the problem of blind source separation in which prior knowledge about the latent source signals, such as time-varying auto-correlation and quasiperiodicity, are incorporated into a linear state-space model. In simulations, we show that in terms of signal-to-error ratio, the sources are inferred more accurately as a result of the inclusion of strong prior knowledge. We explore different schemes of maximum-likelihood optimization for the purpose of learning the model parameters. The Expectation Maximization algorithm, which is often considered the standard optimization method in this context, results in slow convergence when the noise variance is small. In such scenarios, quasi-Newton optimization yields substantial improvements in a range of signal to noise ratios. We analyze the performance of the methods on convolutive mixtures of speech signals.

<p>Author: Kristin P. Bennett, Emilio Parrado-Hernández</p><p>Abstract: The ﬁelds of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semideﬁnite, and semi-inﬁnite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for speciﬁc classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.

<p>Author: Kazuho Watanabe, Sumio Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian learning has been widely used and proved to be effective in many data modeling problems. However, computations involved in it require huge costs and generally cannot be performed exactly. The variational Bayesian approach, proposed as an approximation of Bayesian learning, has provided computational tractability and good generalization performance in many applications. The properties and capabilities of variational Bayesian learning itself have not been clariﬁed yet. It is still unknown how good approximation the variational Bayesian approach can achieve. In this paper, we discuss variational Bayesian learning of Gaussian mixture models and derive upper and lower bounds of variational stochastic complexities. The variational stochastic complexity, which corresponds to the minimum variational free energy and a lower bound of the Bayesian evidence, not only becomes important in addressing the model selection problem, but also enables us to discuss the accuracy of the variational Bayesian approach as an approximation of true Bayesian learning.

<p>Author: Luis M. de Campos</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new scoring function for learning Bayesian networks from data using score+search algorithms. This is based on the concept of mutual information and exploits some well-known properties of this measure in a novel way. Essentially, a statistical independence test based on the chi-square distribution, associated with the mutual information measure, together with a property of additive decomposition of this measure, are combined in order to measure the degree of interaction between each variable and its parent variables in the network. The result is a non-Bayesian scoring function called MIT (mutual information tests) which belongs to the family of scores based on information theory. The MIT score also represents a penalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probability distributions associated with a candidate network and with the available data set. Detailed results of a complete experimental evaluation of the proposed scoring function and its comparison with the well-known K2, BDeu and BIC/MDL scores are also presented.

<p>Author: David A. Ross, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Many perceptual models and theories hinge on treating objects as a collection of constituent parts. When applying these approaches to data, a fundamental problem arises: how can we determine what are the parts? We attack this problem using learning, proposing a form of generative latent factor model, in which each data dimension is allowed to select a different factor or part as its explanation. This approach permits a range of variations that posit different models for the appearance of a part. Here we provide the details for two such models: a discrete and a continuous one. Further, we show that this latent factor model can be extended hierarchically to account for correlations between the appearances of different parts. This permits modeling of data consisting of multiple categories, and learning these categories simultaneously with the parts when they are unobserved. Experiments demonstrate the ability to learn parts-based representations, and categories, of facial images and user-preference data.

<p>Author: Hema Raghavan, Omid Madani, Rosie Jones</p><p>Abstract: We extend the traditional active learning framework to include feedback on features in addition to labeling instances, and we execute a careful study of the effects of feature selection and human feedback on features in the setting of text categorization. Our experiments on a variety of categorization tasks indicate that there is signiﬁcant potential in improving classiﬁer performance by feature re-weighting, beyond that achieved via membership queries alone (traditional active learning) if we have access to an oracle that can point to the important (most predictive) features. Our experiments on human subjects indicate that human feedback on feature relevance can identify a sufﬁcient proportion of the most relevant features (over 50% in our experiments). We ﬁnd that on average, labeling a feature takes much less time than labeling a document. We devise an algorithm that interleaves labeling features and documents which signiﬁcantly accelerates standard active learning in our simulation experiments. Feature feedback can complement traditional active learning in applications such as news ﬁltering, e-mail classiﬁcation, and personalization, where the human teacher can have signiﬁcant knowledge on the relevance of features.

<p>Author: Ron Begleiter, Ran El-Yaniv</p><p>Abstract: We present worst case bounds for the learning rate of a known prediction method that is based on hierarchical applications of binary context tree weighting (CTW) predictors. A heuristic application of this approach that relies on Huffman’s alphabet decomposition is known to achieve state-ofthe-art performance in prediction and lossless compression benchmarks. We show that our new bound for this heuristic is tighter than the best known performance guarantees for prediction and lossless compression algorithms in various settings. This result substantiates the efﬁciency of this hierarchical method and provides a compelling explanation for its practical success. In addition, we present the results of a few experiments that examine other possibilities for improving the multialphabet prediction performance of CTW-based algorithms.

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering refers to a class of techniques which rely on the eigenstructure of a similarity matrix to partition points into disjoint clusters, with points in the same cluster having high similarity and points in different clusters having low similarity. In this paper, we derive new cost functions for spectral clustering based on measures of error between a given partition and a solution of the spectral relaxation of a minimum normalized cut problem. Minimizing these cost functions with respect to the partition leads to new spectral clustering algorithms. Minimizing with respect to the similarity matrix leads to algorithms for learning the similarity matrix from fully labelled data sets. We apply our learning algorithm to the blind one-microphone speech separation problem, casting the problem as one of segmentation of the spectrogram.

<p>Author: Magnus Ekdahl, Timo Koski</p><p>Abstract: In many pattern recognition/classiﬁcation problem the true class conditional model and class probabilities are approximated for reasons of reducing complexity and/or of statistical estimation. The approximated classiﬁer is expected to have worse performance, here measured by the probability of correct classiﬁcation. We present an analysis valid in general, and easily computable formulas for estimating the degradation in probability of correct classiﬁcation when compared to the optimal classiﬁer. An example of an approximation is the Na¨ve Bayes classiﬁer. We show that the perforı mance of the Na¨ve Bayes depends on the degree of functional dependence between the features ı and labels. We provide a sufﬁcient condition for zero loss of performance, too.

<p>Author: Tomáš Šingliar, Miloš Hauskrecht</p><p>Abstract: We develop a new component analysis framework, the Noisy-Or Component Analyzer (NOCA), that targets high-dimensional binary data. NOCA is a probabilistic latent variable model that assumes the expression of observed high-dimensional binary data is driven by a small number of hidden binary sources combined via noisy-or units. The component analysis procedure is equivalent to learning of NOCA parameters. Since the classical EM formulation of the NOCA learning problem is intractable, we develop its variational approximation. We test the NOCA framework on two problems: (1) a synthetic image-decomposition problem and (2) a co-citation data analysis problem for thousands of CiteSeer documents. We demonstrate good performance of the new model on both problems. In addition, we contrast the model to two mixture-based latent-factor models: the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Differing assumptions underlying these models cause them to discover different types of structure in co-citation data, thus illustrating the beneﬁt of NOCA in building our understanding of highdimensional data sets.

<p>Author: Sharlee Climer, Weixiong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Given a matrix of values in which the rows correspond to objects and the columns correspond to features of the objects, rearrangement clustering is the problem of rearranging the rows of the matrix such that the sum of the similarities between adjacent rows is maximized. Referred to by various names and reinvented several times, this clustering technique has been extensively used in many ﬁelds over the last three decades. In this paper, we point out two critical pitfalls that have been previously overlooked. The ﬁrst pitfall is deleterious when rearrangement clustering is applied to objects that form natural clusters. The second concerns a similarity metric that is commonly used. We present an algorithm that overcomes these pitfalls. This algorithm is based on a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem. It offers an extra beneﬁt as it automatically determines cluster boundaries. Using this algorithm, we optimally solve four benchmark problems and a 2,467-gene expression data clustering problem. As expected, our new algorithm identiﬁes better clusters than those found by previous approaches in all ﬁve cases. Overall, our results demonstrate the beneﬁts of rectifying the pitfalls and exemplify the usefulness of this clustering technique. Our code is available at our websites.

<p>Author: Tijl De Bie, Nello Cristianini</p><p>Abstract: The rise of convex programming has changed the face of many research ﬁelds in recent years, machine learning being one of the ones that beneﬁtted the most. A very recent developement, the relaxation of combinatorial problems to semi-deﬁnite programs (SDP), has gained considerable attention over the last decade (Helmberg, 2000; De Bie and Cristianini, 2004a). Although SDP problems can be solved in polynomial time, for many relaxations the exponent in the polynomial complexity bounds is too high for scaling to large problem sizes. This has hampered their uptake as a powerful new tool in machine learning. In this paper, we present a new and fast SDP relaxation of the normalized graph cut problem, and investigate its usefulness in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. In particular, this provides a convex algorithm for transduction, as well as approaches to clustering. We further propose a whole cascade of fast relaxations that all hold the middle between older spectral relaxations and the new SDP relaxation, allowing one to trade oﬀ computational cost versus relaxation accuracy. Finally, we discuss how the methodology developed in this paper can be applied to other combinatorial problems in machine learning, and we treat the max-cut problem as an example.

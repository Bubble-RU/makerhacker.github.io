<h1>6 jmlr-2006-A Scoring Function for Learning Bayesian Networks based on Mutual Information and Conditional Independence Tests</h1>

This is based on the concept of mutual information and exploits some well-known properties of this measure in a novel way. Essentially, a statistical independence test based on the chi-square distribution, associated with the mutual information measure, together with a property of additive decomposition of this measure, are combined in order to measure the degree of interaction between each variable and its parent variables in the network. The result is a non-Bayesian scoring function called MIT (mutual information tests) which belongs to the family of scores based on information theory. The MIT score also represents a penalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probability distributions associated with a candidate network and with the available data set. Detailed results of a complete experimental evaluation of the proposed scoring function and its comparison with the well-known K2, BDeu and BIC/MDL scores are also presented.

</p><p>6 DE  C AMPOS  associated with Bayesian networks, the search being guided by a scoring function that evaluates the degree of ﬁtness between each element in this space and the available data. [sent-25, score-0.29]
</p><p>7 The proposed scoring function is based on the concept of mutual information. [sent-29, score-0.375]
</p><p>8 Mutual information has already been used either directly or indirectly within Bayesian network learning algorithms based on score and search (Bouckaert, 1993; Chow and Liu, 1968; Lam and Bacchus, 1994). [sent-31, score-0.201]
</p><p>9 However, what is new is the simultaneous quantiﬁcation of the results of a set of independence tests based on mutual information. [sent-35, score-0.216]
</p><p>10 Basically, we use mutual information in order to measure the degree of interaction between each variable and its parent variables in the network, but penalizing this value using a term related to the chi-square distribution. [sent-36, score-0.21]
</p><p>11 To a certain extent what we are proposing is a hybrid algorithm (either an algorithm based on scoring independences and search or an algorithm based on quantitative conditional independence tests). [sent-39, score-0.371]
</p><p>12 Sections 2 and 3 of this paper provide some background about learning Bayesian networks and types of scoring functions, respectively. [sent-40, score-0.298]
</p><p>13 Section 4 covers the development of the new scoring function, which we shall call MIT (mutual information tests). [sent-41, score-0.311]
</p><p>14 Section 5 carries out an empirical comparative study of MIT against several state-of-the-art scoring functions (K2, BDeu and BIC/MDL). [sent-42, score-0.284]
</p><p>15 The algorithms based on a scoring function attempt to ﬁnd a graph that maximizes the selected score, which is usually deﬁned as a measure of ﬁtness between the graph and the data. [sent-85, score-0.256]
</p><p>16 All of them use the scoring function in combination with a search method in order to measure the goodness of each explored structure from the space of feasible solutions. [sent-86, score-0.29]
</p><p>17 Different learning algorithms are obtained depending on the search procedure used, as well as on the deﬁnitions of the scoring function and the search space. [sent-87, score-0.324]
</p><p>18 The most usual scoring functions will be described later in more detail. [sent-90, score-0.256]
</p><p>19 2152  S CORING BAYESIAN N ETWORKS USING M UTUAL I NFORMATION AND I NDEPENDENCE T ESTS  where g(G : D) is the scoring function measuring the degree of ﬁtness of any candidate DAG G to the data set, and Gn is the family of all the DAGs deﬁned on Un . [sent-118, score-0.28]
</p><p>20 Another property which is particularly interesting if the learning algorithm searches in a space of equivalence classes of DAGs is called the score equivalence: a scoring function g is scoreequivalent if it assigns the same value to all DAGs that are represented by the same essential graph. [sent-123, score-0.402]
</p><p>21 We shall use the following notation: the number of states of the variable Xi is ri ; the number of possible conﬁgurations of the parent set PaG (Xi ) of Xi is qi ; obviously, qi = ∏X j ∈PaG (Xi ) r j ; wi j , j = 1, . [sent-127, score-0.351]
</p><p>22 As it is easier to work in the logarithmic space, in practice, the scoring functions use the value log(p(G, D)) instead of p(G, D). [sent-135, score-0.256]
</p><p>23 One of the ﬁrst Bayesian scoring functions, called K2, was proposed by Cooper and Herskovits (1992). [sent-136, score-0.256]
</p><p>24 While the result is a scoring function called BDe (and its expression is identical to the BD one in Equation 2), the hyperparameters can now be computed in the following way: ηi jk = η × p(xik , wi j |G0 ), where p(. [sent-151, score-0.305]
</p><p>25 This score only depends on one parameter, the equivalent sample size η, and is expressed as follows: n  gBDeu (G : D) = log(p(G)) + ∑  i=1  η Γ( qi )  qi  ∑  j=1  log  η Γ(Ni j + qi )  ri  + ∑ log k=1  Γ(Ni jk + riη i ) q Γ( riη i ) q  . [sent-155, score-0.415]
</p><p>26 2 Scoring Functions based on Information Theory These scoring functions represent another option for measuring the degree of ﬁtness of a DAG to a data set and are based on codiﬁcation and information theory concepts. [sent-158, score-0.28]
</p><p>27 Therefore, the description length includes the length required to represent the network plus the length necessary to represent the data given the network (Bouckaert, 1993, 1995; Friedman and Goldszmidt, 1996; Lam and Bacchus, 1994; Suzuki, 1993). [sent-167, score-0.148]
</p><p>28 This value is minimum for a ﬁxed network structure when the network parameters are estimated from the data set itself by using maximum likelihood. [sent-173, score-0.148]
</p><p>29 The log-likelihood can be expressed in the following way (Bouckaert, 1995): n  qi  LLD (G) = ∑ ∑  ri  ∑ Ni jk log  i=1 j=1 k=1  Ni jk Ni j  . [sent-174, score-0.277]
</p><p>30 (4)  Therefore, the MDL scoring function (by changing the signs to deal with a maximization problem) is: n qi r i Ni jk 1 gMDL (G : D) = ∑ ∑ ∑ Ni jk log − C(G) log(N). [sent-175, score-0.401]
</p><p>31 This leads to a generalization of the scoring function in Equation 5: n qi r i Ni jk g(G : D) = ∑ ∑ ∑ Ni jk log −C(G) f (N), (6) Ni j i=1 j=1 k=1 where f (N) is a non-negative penalization function. [sent-178, score-0.472]
</p><p>32 It is necessary to add a penalization term since the minimum conditional entropy is always obtained after adding all the possible variables to the parent set. [sent-191, score-0.207]
</p><p>33 With respect to the characteristics of the different scoring functions, all are decomposable and with the exception of K2 and BD, they are also score-equivalent (Chickering, 1995). [sent-193, score-0.256]
</p><p>34 A New Scoring Function based on Mutual Information and Independence Tests In order to explain the ideas behind the proposed scoring function more clearly, we shall ﬁrst introduce several preliminary considerations. [sent-195, score-0.311]
</p><p>35 These will lead to a ﬁrst version of the scoring function, which will be later reﬁned in order to obtain the ﬁnal version. [sent-196, score-0.256]
</p><p>36 We shall now consider the concept of mutual information. [sent-220, score-0.174]
</p><p>37 Given a probability distribution p deﬁned over two sets of variables X and Y, the mutual information between X and Y is: p(x, y) , p(x)p(y)  MI(X, Y) = ∑ p(x, y) log x,y  which can also be expressed in terms of entropy as: MI(X, Y) = H(X) + H(Y) − H(X ∪ Y). [sent-221, score-0.161]
</p><p>38 2157  DE  C AMPOS  We have still not achieved anything useful, however, since mutual information has the property that MI(X, Y ∪ W) ≥ MI(X, Y), in other words, mutual information always increases by including additional variables. [sent-228, score-0.238]
</p><p>39 However, there are certain advantages to using mutual information instead of log-likelihood as we shall see later. [sent-233, score-0.174]
</p><p>40 In our opinion, one problem with the scoring functions based on information (Equation 6) is that they penalize log-likelihood globally, with a combination of the network complexity and a function that depends only on the number of instances. [sent-244, score-0.33]
</p><p>41 The scoring function that we shall propose naturally incorporates this kind of penalization, and is based on solid statistical grounds. [sent-247, score-0.311]
</p><p>42 Let si be the number of parent variables8 of Xi , si = |PaG (Xi )|. [sent-249, score-0.312]
</p><p>43 (14)  j=2  The elements in this decomposition of the mutual information will be interpreted as follows: starting with an empty set of parents of Xi , we have ﬁrst included the arc Xi1 → Xi , and the degree of dependence between these variables is MID (Xi , Xi1 ). [sent-282, score-0.222]
</p><p>44 si should not be confused with qi , which represents the number of conﬁgurations of these variables. [sent-312, score-0.168]
</p><p>45 Our proposal is to quantify the result of the independence test to build the scoring function. [sent-317, score-0.313]
</p><p>46 Therefore, a measure of the global quality of the set PaG (Xi ) as the parent set of variable Xi is: si  ∑  g(Xi , PaG (Xi ) : D) =  2N MID (Xi , Xi j |{Xi1 , . [sent-322, score-0.191]
</p><p>47 , Xi( j−1) }) − χα,li j  j=2  +2N MID (Xi , Xi1 ) − χα,li1 ,  (15)  where χα,li j is the value such that p(χ2 (li j ) ≤ χα,li j ) = α, and the number of degrees of freedom is: j−1  li j =  (ri − 1)(ri j − 1) ∏k=1 rik (ri − 1)(ri1 − 1)  j = 2, . [sent-325, score-0.157]
</p><p>48 (16)  The expression in Equation 15 is then a global quantiﬁcation of a series of s i simultaneous conditional independence tests, and by virtue of the decomposition of mutual information in Equation 14, it is equivalent to: si  g(Xi , PaG (Xi ) : D) = 2N MID (Xi , PaG (Xi )) − ∑ χα,li j . [sent-329, score-0.321]
</p><p>49 (17)  j=1  The scoring function would therefore be deﬁned according to Equation 11 as: n  g(G : D) =  ∑  i=1 / PaG (Xi )=0  si  2N MID (Xi , PaG (Xi )) − ∑ χα,li j . [sent-330, score-0.377]
</p><p>50 (18)  j=1  It should be noted that although the value of mutual information will increase after new variables are added to the parent set, the penalization component (which contains one term for each parent variable) will also increase. [sent-331, score-0.351]
</p><p>51 Let us suppose that the number of states of the variables Xi , X1 , X2 and X3 is ri = 3, r1 = 2, r2 = 3 and r3 = 4. [sent-352, score-0.153]
</p><p>52 Observe that ∑sj=1 li j = ∑sj=1 (ri − 1)(ri j − 1) ∏k=1 rik = (ri − 1)(∏sj=1 ri j − 1). [sent-363, score-0.236]
</p><p>53 σi  j=1  The ﬁnal expression of the proposed scoring function, which we shall call MIT (from mutual information tests), is: si  n  gMIT (G : D) =  2N MID (Xi , PaG (Xi )) − max ∑ χα,liσi ( j) . [sent-384, score-0.551]
</p><p>54 Fortunately, this will not be necessary as this maximum can be obtained in a much simpler way:  Theorem 2 For the values liσi ( j) deﬁned in Equation 19, si  max ∑ χα,liσi ( j) = σi  j=1  si  ∑ χα,l  j=1  iσ∗ ( j) i  ,  where σ∗ is any permutation of PaG (Xi ) satisfying riσ∗ (1) ≥ riσ∗ (2) ≥ . [sent-387, score-0.266]
</p><p>55 The way of measuring the degree of undesirability of removing the variable Y from Z is to use the difference between the mutual information statistic 2N MID (Xi ,Y |Z \ {Y }) and the chi-square value χα,l with the appropriate degrees of freedom. [sent-407, score-0.174]
</p><p>56 We can prove the following result: Theorem 4 The MIT scoring function deﬁned in Equation 20 can also be expressed as: n  gMIT (G : D) =  ∑  gr (Xi , PaG (Xi ) : D),  i=1 / PaG (Xi )=0  where gr (Xi , PaG (Xi ) : D) are the local scores deﬁned in Equation 21. [sent-412, score-0.369]
</p><p>57 Theorem 5 The MIT scoring function deﬁned in Equation 20 is decomposable. [sent-414, score-0.256]
</p><p>58 It is sufﬁcient to take into account Equation 12 and remember that the maximum 2163  DE  C AMPOS  X1  X1 X4  X2  X4  X3  X2  G1  X3  G2  Figure 1: Two equivalent DAGs with different values of the MIT score likelihood score is score-equivalent. [sent-419, score-0.186]
</p><p>59 Theorem 6 The MIT scoring function assigns the same value to all DAGs that are represented by the same RPDAG. [sent-443, score-0.256]
</p><p>60 Although the MIT score should not be used to search in the space of essential graphs, we can therefore use it without any problem to search in both the DAG and the RPDAG space. [sent-444, score-0.187]
</p><p>61 2164  S CORING BAYESIAN N ETWORKS USING M UTUAL I NFORMATION AND I NDEPENDENCE T ESTS  To conclude our study of the new score, we have observed an interesting relation between MIT and the scoring functions based on Equation 6. [sent-445, score-0.256]
</p><p>62 First, it should be noted that the log-likelihood of the simplest possible network, namely the empty network G 0 , is, according to Equation 4 (and taking / into account that in this case qi = 1 and Ni jk = Nik ): n  ri  n  Nik N  LLD (G0 ) = ∑ ∑ Nik log / i=1 k=1  = −N ∑ HD (Xi ). [sent-446, score-0.302]
</p><p>63 i=1  Then, considering Equation 12, we can express the sum of mutual information measures between each variable and its set of parents in G as follows: n  ∑  MID (Xi , PaG (Xi )) =  i=1 / PaG (Xi )=0  LLD (G) − LL(G0 ) / . [sent-447, score-0.167]
</p><p>64 Now, let us consider the difference between G and G 0 in terms of / / complexity, which is: n  n  C(G) −C(G0 ) = ∑ (ri − 1)qi − ∑ (ri − 1) = / i=1  i=1  n  si  i=1 / PaG (Xi )=0  j=1  n  ∑  ∑ ∑ li j ,  (ri − 1)(qi − 1) =  i=1 / PaG (Xi )=0  with li j deﬁned as in Equation 16. [sent-449, score-0.267]
</p><p>65 Therefore, the MIT score of a network G could be interpreted in terms of the difference between the information-based scores of G and G0 , and also as the decrease in description length achieved by using G instead of / G0 . [sent-452, score-0.202]
</p><p>66 Experimental Evaluation In order to determine the possible merit of the proposed scoring function in practical terms, in this section we shall carry out an experimental evaluation of the MIT score, comparing it with other well-known scoring functions. [sent-455, score-0.567]
</p><p>67 The selected scoring functions are the most frequently used: K2 (Equation 1), BDeu (Equation 3) and BIC/MDL (Equation 5). [sent-456, score-0.256]
</p><p>68 For BDeu, we shall use a uniform 2165  DE  C AMPOS  prior distribution over possible structures and as this score is quite sensitive with respect to the value of the equivalent sample size, we shall use ﬁve values of this parameter, more precisely η = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. [sent-457, score-0.203]
</p><p>69 First, we deﬁne the performance criteria that we shall use to compare the different scoring functions. [sent-465, score-0.311]
</p><p>70 1 Performance Criteria One way of measuring the quality of a scoring function is to study its ability to reconstruct (in combination with a learning algorithm based on score+search) the Bayesian network which generated the data. [sent-467, score-0.354]
</p><p>71 Then, using the scoring function together with a search method, we obtain a learned network G, which must be compared with the original network G0 . [sent-469, score-0.438]
</p><p>72 More precisely, the number of added arcs (A(G)), deleted arcs (D(G)), and inverted arcs (I(G)) in the learned network with respect to the original one is computed. [sent-472, score-0.32]
</p><p>73 One alternative way of measuring the quality of a scoring function which does not require an initial Bayesian network to be used as a starting point is to use the network learned with such a scoring function for a speciﬁc task and then to evaluate the level of success achieved. [sent-496, score-0.684]
</p><p>74 , 1997) 2167  DE  C AMPOS  10  21  22  13 15  19  25  18  26  1  2  4  27  11  29  7  17  5  31  28  6  20  8  23  32  34  35  12  9  16  36  37  24  33  14  3  30  Figure 2: The Alarm network is a network for evaluating car insurance risks. [sent-515, score-0.201]
</p><p>75 We therefore have a design 13 × 4 × 3 (10 scoring functions plus 3 versions of a constraintbased algorithm, 4 problems and 3 sample sizes), and for each of these 156 conﬁgurations we use 5 different databases, which gives us a total of 780 experiments. [sent-531, score-0.256]
</p><p>76 It is also possible to observe how MIT generally behaves better than the other scores, with respect to all the performance measures, and more speciﬁcally, in terms of BIC/MDL (which is the closest scoring function in spirit to the new score), MIT systematically obtains much better results. [sent-543, score-0.256]
</p><p>77 43720  Table 4: Results for the Insurance network We believe that these results support the conclusion that the MIT score can compete favorably with state-of-the-art scoring functions and constraint-based algorithms for the task of learning general purpose Bayesian networks. [sent-1366, score-0.423]
</p><p>78 Moreover, in the case that we wish to select a non-Bayesian scoring function based on information theory, we would recommend BIC/MDL be discarded and MIT used instead. [sent-1367, score-0.256]
</p><p>79 It is also interesting to remark that the two scoring functions that behave best (MIT and K2) are not score equivalent, whereas the two that obtain comparatively poor results (BIC and BDeu), are. [sent-1368, score-0.349]
</p><p>80 Therefore, score equivalence does not seem to be an important property for learning Bayesian networks by searching in the DAG space. [sent-1369, score-0.162]
</p><p>81 One way to do this is to generate an ensemble of networks that were found by the search procedures using the different scores and see how each of the scores rank the networks in this ensemble. [sent-1372, score-0.188]
</p><p>82 So, for each of the sixty databases used in the previous experiments we have considered the ten networks obtained by the different scoring functions, computing the ranking of these networks according to each score. [sent-1373, score-0.34]
</p><p>83 23  Table 9: Average values of the Spearman correlation coefﬁcient between the rankings generated by each scoring function and the KL divergence  the Hamming distance (with MIT being better than BIC). [sent-1545, score-0.299]
</p><p>84 In our opinion, the fact that MIT behaves very good in terms of both structural and distributional quality support the conclusion that it is a very competitive scoring function. [sent-1546, score-0.256]
</p><p>85 3 Experiments in Automatic Classiﬁcation As we commented previously, another approach to evaluating the quality of a scoring function is to use it to learn a Bayesian network classiﬁer, and then to measure the performance of the classiﬁer, for example in terms of predictive accuracy. [sent-1548, score-0.33]
</p><p>86 We therefore have a 29 × 4 design (29 problems and 4 scoring functions), and for each of these 116 conﬁgurations, we carry out 3 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation, with a total of 3480 runs of the C-RPDAG learning algorithm. [sent-1577, score-0.256]
</p><p>87 We can observe that there are no great differences between the different scoring functions (with the exception perhaps of BIC which seems to behave worst). [sent-1582, score-0.256]
</p><p>88 Concluding Remarks In this paper, we have deﬁned a new scoring function for learning Bayesian networks through score+search algorithms. [sent-1592, score-0.298]
</p><p>89 Using another mutual information property that allows us to build an independence test relying on the chi-square distribution, it is possible to interpret mutual information between a variable and 15. [sent-1596, score-0.295]
</p><p>90 The result is a scoring function (called MIT) which is similar to those based on maximizing a penalized version of the log-likelihood, such as BIC/MDL. [sent-1722, score-0.256]
</p><p>91 Although MIT is a scoring function, the result of using it within an algorithm based on score and search has many similarities with learning algorithms based on independence tests. [sent-1724, score-0.44]
</p><p>92 The MIT scoring function is decomposable and is not score equivalent, although it satisﬁes a restricted form of score equivalence which allows us to use it to search not only in the DAG space but also in the RPDAG space. [sent-1728, score-0.503]
</p><p>93 Nevertheless, for future research we would like to develop a scoring function which is based on the same MIT principles but which satisﬁes the score equivalence property, to be used by learning algorithms that search in the space of essential graphs. [sent-1729, score-0.436]
</p><p>94 Furthermore, the expression of the MIT score depends on a free parameter: the conﬁdence level α associated with the chi-square independence tests. [sent-1730, score-0.15]
</p><p>95 By applying the Shurj=1 j=1 i k=1 i i i i hence concavity of f i,α , we then obtain ∑sj=1 χα,liσi ( j) ≤ ∑sj=1 χα,liσ∗ ( j) ∀σi , i si si ∑ j=1 χα,liσ∗ ( j) = maxσi ∑ j=1 χα,liσi ( j) . [sent-1792, score-0.242]
</p><p>96 Let us suppose that the result is true when the size of the parent set of Xi is equal to si − 1 and consider a case where |PaG (Xi )| = si . [sent-1832, score-0.312]
</p><p>97 σi  k=1  Therefore, we have gr (Xi , PaG (Xi ) : D) = 2N MID (Xi , PaG (Xi )) − maxσi ∑si χα,liσi (k) and k=1 sult is also true for parent sets of Xi with size equal to si . [sent-1839, score-0.23]
</p><p>98 This result is evident as the scoring function is, by deﬁnition, a sum of local scores. [sent-1842, score-0.256]

<p>Author: Luis M. de Campos</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new scoring function for learning Bayesian networks from data using score+search algorithms. This is based on the concept of mutual information and exploits some well-known properties of this measure in a novel way. Essentially, a statistical independence test based on the chi-square distribution, associated with the mutual information measure, together with a property of additive decomposition of this measure, are combined in order to measure the degree of interaction between each variable and its parent variables in the network. The result is a non-Bayesian scoring function called MIT (mutual information tests) which belongs to the family of scores based on information theory. The MIT score also represents a penalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probability distributions associated with a candidate network and with the available data set. Detailed results of a complete experimental evaluation of the proposed scoring function and its comparison with the well-known K2, BDeu and BIC/MDL scores are also presented.

In machine learning, this model is related to multi-class probability estimates by coupling all pairwise classiﬁcation results. Error correcting output codes (ECOC) are a general framework to decompose a multi-class problem to several binary problems. To obtain probability estimates under this framework, this paper introduces a generalized Bradley-Terry model in which paired individual comparisons are extended to paired team comparisons. We propose a simple algorithm with convergence proofs to solve the model and obtain individual skill. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the algorithm is useful for obtaining multi-class probability estimates. Moreover, we discuss four extensions of the proposed model: 1) weighted individual skill, 2) home-ﬁeld advantage, 3) ties, and 4) comparisons with more than two teams.

<p>Author: Radu Stefan Niculescu, Tom M. Mitchell, R. Bharat Rao</p><p>Abstract: The task of learning models for many real-world problems requires incorporating domain knowledge into learning algorithms, to enable accurate learning from a realistic volume of training data. This paper considers a variety of types of domain knowledge for constraining parameter estimates when learning Bayesian networks. In particular, we consider domain knowledge that constrains the values or relationships among subsets of parameters in a Bayesian network with known structure. We incorporate a wide variety of parameter constraints into learning procedures for Bayesian networks, by formulating this task as a constrained optimization problem. The assumptions made in module networks, dynamic Bayes nets and context speciﬁc independence models can be viewed as particular cases of such parameter constraints. We present closed form solutions or fast iterative algorithms for estimating parameters subject to several speciﬁc classes of parameter constraints, including equalities and inequalities among parameters, constraints on individual parameters, and constraints on sums and ratios of parameters, for discrete and continuous variables. Our methods cover learning from both frequentist and Bayesian points of view, from both complete and incomplete data. We present formal guarantees for our estimators, as well as methods for automatically learning useful parameter constraints from data. To validate our approach, we apply it to the domain of fMRI brain image analysis. Here we demonstrate the ability of our system to ﬁrst learn useful relationships among parameters, and then to use them to constrain the training of the Bayesian network, resulting in improved cross-validated accuracy of the learned model. Experiments on synthetic data are also presented. Keywords: Bayesian networks, constrained optimization, domain knowledge c 2006 Radu Stefan Niculescu, Tom Mitchell and Bharat Rao.

<p>Author: Kazuho Watanabe, Sumio Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian learning has been widely used and proved to be effective in many data modeling problems. However, computations involved in it require huge costs and generally cannot be performed exactly. The variational Bayesian approach, proposed as an approximation of Bayesian learning, has provided computational tractability and good generalization performance in many applications. The properties and capabilities of variational Bayesian learning itself have not been clariﬁed yet. It is still unknown how good approximation the variational Bayesian approach can achieve. In this paper, we discuss variational Bayesian learning of Gaussian mixture models and derive upper and lower bounds of variational stochastic complexities. The variational stochastic complexity, which corresponds to the minimum variational free energy and a lower bound of the Bayesian evidence, not only becomes important in addressing the model selection problem, but also enables us to discuss the accuracy of the variational Bayesian approach as an approximation of true Bayesian learning.

<p>Author: Magnus Ekdahl, Timo Koski</p><p>Abstract: In many pattern recognition/classiﬁcation problem the true class conditional model and class probabilities are approximated for reasons of reducing complexity and/or of statistical estimation. The approximated classiﬁer is expected to have worse performance, here measured by the probability of correct classiﬁcation. We present an analysis valid in general, and easily computable formulas for estimating the degradation in probability of correct classiﬁcation when compared to the optimal classiﬁer. An example of an approximation is the Na¨ve Bayes classiﬁer. We show that the perforı mance of the Na¨ve Bayes depends on the degree of functional dependence between the features ı and labels. We provide a sufﬁcient condition for zero loss of performance, too.

<p>Author: Bernhard Moser</p><p>Abstract: Kernels are two-placed functions that can be interpreted as inner products in some Hilbert space. It is this property which makes kernels predestinated to carry linear models of learning, optimization or classiﬁcation strategies over to non-linear variants. Following this idea, various kernel-based methods like support vector machines or kernel principal component analysis have been conceived which prove to be successful for machine learning, data mining and computer vision applications. When applying a kernel-based method a central question is the choice and the design of the kernel function. This paper provides a novel view on kernels based on fuzzy-logical concepts which allows to incorporate prior knowledge in the design process. It is demonstrated that kernels mapping to the unit interval with constant one in its diagonal can be represented by a commonly used fuzzylogical formula for representing fuzzy rule bases. This means that a great class of kernels can be represented by fuzzy-logical concepts. Apart from this result, which only guarantees the existence of such a representation, constructive examples are presented and the relation to unlabeled learning is pointed out. Keywords: kernel, triangular norm, T -transitivity, fuzzy relation, residuum 1. Motivation Positive-deﬁniteness plays a prominent role especially in optimization and machine learning due to the fact that two-place functions with this property, so-called kernels, can be represented as inner products in some Hilbert space. Thereby, optimization techniques conceived on the basis of linear models can be extended to non-linear algorithms. For a survey of applications see, for example, ¨ Jolliffe (1986), Sch¨ lkopf and Smola (2002) and Scholkopf et al. (1998). o Recently in Moser (2006) it was shown that kernels with values from the unit interval can be interpreted as fuzzy equivalence relations motivated by the idea that kernels express a kind of similarity. This means that the concept of fuzzy equivalence relations, or synonymously fuzzy similarity relations, is more general than that of kernels, provided only values in the unit interval are considered. Fuzzy equivalence relations distinguish from Boolean equivalence relations by a many-valued extension of transitivity which can be interpreted as many-valued logical model of the statement “IF x is similar to y AND y is similar to z THEN x is similar to z”. In contrast to the Boolean case, in many-valued logics the set of truth values is extended such that also assertions, for example, whether two elements x and y are similar, can be treated as a matter of degree. The standard model for the set of (quasi) truth values of fuzzy logic and other many-valued logical systems is the unit interval. If E(x, y) represents the (quasi) truth value of the statement that x is c 2006 Bernhard Moser. M OSER similar to y, then the many-valued version of transitivity is modeled by T (E(x, y), E(y, z)) ≤ E(x, z) where T is a so-called triangular norm which is an extension of the Boolean conjunction. This many-valued concept for transitivity is called T -transitivity. For a survey on triangular norms see, for example, Dubois and Prade (1985), Gottwald (1986), Gottwald (1993) and Klement et al. (2000), ¨ and for fuzzy equivalence relations and T -transitivity see, for example, Bodenhofer (2003), H ohle (1993), H¨ hle (1999), Klement et al. (2000), and Zadeh (1971). o Based on the semantics of fuzzy logic, this approach allows to incorporate knowledge-based models for the design of kernels. From this perspective, the most interesting mathematical question is how positive-semideﬁnite fuzzy equivalence relations can be characterized or at least constructed under some circumstances. At least for some special cases, proofs are provided in Section 4, which motivate further research aiming at establishing a more general theory on the positive-deﬁniteness of fuzzy equivalence relations. These cases are based on the most prominent representatives of triangular norms, that is the Minimum, the Product and the Łukasiewicz t-norm. The paper is structured as follows. First of all, in Section 2, some basic prerequisites concerning kernels and fuzzy relations are outlined. In Section 3, a result about the T -transitivity of kernels from Moser (2006) is cited and interpreted as existence statement that guarantees a representation of kernels mapping to the unit interval with constant 1 in its diagonal by a certain, commonly used, fuzzy-logical construction of a fuzzy equivalence relation. Finally, in contrast to the pure existence theorem of Section 3, in Section 4 constructive examples of fuzzy equivalence relations are provided which are proven to be kernels. In a concluding remark, the relationship to the problem of labeled and unlabeled learning is pointed out. 2. Prerequisites This section summarizes deﬁnitions and facts from the theory of kernels as well as from fuzzy set theory which are needed later on. 2.1 Kernels and Positive-Semideﬁniteness Preserving Functions There is an extensive literature concerning kernels and kernel-based methods like support vector machines or kernel principal component analysis especially in the machine learning, data mining ¨ and computer vision communities. For an overview and introduction, see, for example, Sch olkopf and Smola (2002). Here we present only what is needed later on. For completeness let us recall the basic deﬁnition for kernels and positive-semideﬁniteness. Deﬁnition 1 Let X be a non-empty set. A real-valued function k : X × X → R is said to be a kernel iff it is symmetric, that is, k(x, y) = k(y, x) for all x, y ∈ X , and positive-semideﬁnite, that is, ∑n j=1 ci c j k(xi , x j ) ≥ 0 for any n ∈ N, any choice of x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X and any choice of c1 , . . . , cn ∈ R. i, One way to generate new kernels from known kernels is to apply operations which preserve the positive-semideﬁniteness property. A characterization of such operations is provided by C. H. FitzGerald (1995). Theorem 2 (Closeness Properties of Kernels) Let f : Rn → R, n ∈ N, then k : X × X → R given by k(x, y) := f (k1 (x, y), . . . , kn (x, y)) 2604 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS is a kernel for any choice of kernels k1 , . . . , kn on X × X iff f is the real restriction of an entire function on Cn of the form f (x1 , . . . , xn ) = ∑ r1 ≥0,...,rn ≥0 r r cr1 ,...,rn x11 · · · xnn (1) where cr1 ,...,rn ≥ 0 for all nonnegative indices r1 , . . . , rn . 2.2 Triangular Norms Triangular norms have been originally studied within the framework of probabilistic metric spaces, see Schweizer and Sklar (1961) and Schweizer and Sklar (1983). In this context, t-norms proved to be an appropriate concept when dealing with triangle inequalities. Later on, t-norms and their dual version, t-conorms, have been used to model conjunction and disjunction for many-valued logic, see Dubois and Prade (1985), Gottwald (1986), Gottwald (1993) and Klement et al. (2000). Deﬁnition 3 A function T : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] is called t-norm (triangular norm), if it satisﬁes the following conditions: (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) ∀x, y ∈ [0, 1] : ∀x, y, z ∈ [0, 1] : ∀x, y, z ∈ [0, 1] : ∀x, y ∈ [0, 1] : T (x, y) = T (y, x) T (x, T (y, z)) = T (T (x, y), z) y ≤ z =⇒ T (x, y) ≤ T (x, z) T (x, 1) = x ∧ T (1, y) = y (commutativity) (associativity) (monotonicity) (boundary condition) Further, a t-norm is called Archimedean if it is continuous and satisﬁes x ∈ (0, 1) ⇒ T (x, x) < x. Due to its associativity, many-placed extensions Tn : [0, 1]n → [0, 1], n ∈ N, of a t-norm T are uniquely determined by Tn (x1 , . . . , xn ) = T (x1 , Tn−1 (x2 , . . . , xn )). Archimedean t-norms are characterized by the following representation theorem due to Ling (1965): Theorem 4 Let T : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] be a t-norm. Then T is Archimedean if, and only if, there is a continuous, strictly decreasing function f : [0, 1] → [0, ∞] with f (1) = 0 such that for x, y ∈ [0, 1], T (x, y) = f −1 (min( f (x) + f (y), f (0))). By setting g(x) = exp (− f (x)), Ling’s characterization yields an alternative representation with a multiplicative generator function T (x, y) = g−1 (max(g(x) g(y), g(0))). For g(x) = x we get the product TP (x, y) = x y. The setting f (x) = 1 − x yields the so-called Łukasiewcz t-norm TL (x, y) = max(x + y − 1, 0). Due to Ling’s theorem 4 an Archimedean t-norm T is isomorphic either to TL or TP , depending on whether the additive generator takes a ﬁnite value at 0 or not. In the former case, the Archimedean t-norm is called non-strict, in the latter it is called strict. 2605 M OSER A many-valued model of an implication is provided by the so-called residuum given by → T (a, b) = sup{c ∈ [0, 1]|T (a, c) ≤ b} (2) where T is a left-continuous t-norm. Equation (2) is uniquely determined by the so-called adjunction property → ∀a, b, c ∈ [0, 1] : T (a, b) ≤ c ⇔ a ≤ T (b, c). Consequently, the operator ↔ → → T (a, b) = min T (a, b), T (b, a) (3) (4) models a biimplication. For details, for example, see Gottwald (1986) and Klement et al. (2000). → Tables 1 and 2 list examples of t-norms with their induced residuum T . For further examples see, for example, Klement et al. (2000). √ √ Tcos (a, b) = max(ab − 1 − a2 1 − b2 , 0) TL (a, b) = max(a + b − 1, 0) TP (a, b) = ab TM (a, b) = min(a, b) Table 1: Examples of t-norms → T cos (a, b) = → T L (a, b) = → = T P (a, b) → T M (a, b) = cos(arccos(b) − arccos(a)) if a > b, 1 else min(b − a + 1, 1) b if a > b, a 1 else b if a > b, 1 else Table 2: Examples of residuums 2.3 T -Equivalences If we want to classify based on a notion of similarity or indistinguishability, we face the problem of transitivity. For instance, let us consider two real numbers to be indistinguishable if and only if they differ by at most a certain bound ε > 0, this is modeled by the relation ∼ ε given by x ∼ε y :⇔ |x−y| < ε, ε > 0, x, y ∈ R. Note that the relation ∼ε is not transitive and, therefore, not an equivalence relation. The transitivity requirement turns out to be too strong for this example. The problem of identiﬁcation and transitivity in the context of similarity of physical objects was early pointed out and discussed philosophically by Poincar´ (1902) and Poincar´ (1904). In the framework of fuzzy e e logic, the way to overcome this problem is to model similarity by fuzzy relations based on a many¨ valued concept of transitivity, see Bodenhofer (2003), H ohle (1993), H¨ hle (1999), Klement et al. o (2000) and Zadeh (1971). 2606 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS Deﬁnition 5 A function E : X 2 −→ [0, 1] is called a fuzzy equivalence relation, or synonymously, T -equivalence with respect to the t-norm T if it satisﬁes the following conditions: (i) ∀x ∈ X : E(x, x) = 1 (reﬂexivity) (ii) ∀x, y ∈ X : E(x, y) = E(y, x) (symmetry) (iii) ∀x, y, z ∈ X : T (E(x, y), E(y, z)) ≤ E(x, z) (T-transitivity). The value E(x, y) can be also looked at as the (quasi) truth value of the statement “x is equal to y”. Following this semantics, T-transitivity can be seen as a many-valued model of the proposition, “If x is equal to y and y is equal to z, then x is equal to z”. T -equivalences for Archimedean t-norms are closely related to metrics and pseudo-metrics as shown by Klement et al. (2000) and Moser (1995). Theorem 6 Let T be an Archimedean t-norm given by ∀a, b ∈ [0, 1] : T (a, b) = f −1 (min( f (a) + f (b), f (0))), where f : [0, 1] → [0, ∞] is a strictly decreasing, continuous function with f (1) = 0. (i) If d : X 2 → [0, ∞[ is a pseudo-metric, then the function Ed : X 2 → [0, 1] deﬁned by Ed (x, y) = f −1 (min(d(x, y), f (0))) is a T -equivalence with respect to the t-norm T . (ii) If E : X 2 → [0, 1] is a T -equivalence relation, then the function dE : X 2 → [0, ∞] deﬁned by dE (x, y) = f (E(x, y)) is a pseudo-metric. → Another way to construct T -equivalences is to employ T -operators. The proof of the following assertion can be found in Trillas and Valverde (1984), Kruse et al. (1993) and Kruse et al. (1994). ↔ Theorem 7 Let T be a left-continuous t-norm, T its induced biimplication, µi : X → [0, 1], i ∈ I, I non-empty; then E : X × X → [0, 1] given by ↔ E(x, y) = inf T (µi (x), µi (y)) i∈I (5) is a T -equivalence relation. ¨ For further details on T -equivalences see also Boixader and Jacas (1999), H oppner et al. (2002), Jacas (1988), Trillas et al. (1999) and Valverde (1985). 3. Representing Kernels by T -Equivalences It is interesting that the concept of kernels, which is motivated by geometric reasoning in terms of inner products and mappings to Hilbert spaces and which is inherently formulated by algebraic terms, is closely related to the concept of fuzzy equivalence relations as demonstrated and discussed in more detail in Moser (2006). In this section, we start with the result that any kernel k : X × X → [0, 1] with k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X is T -transitive and, therefore, a fuzzy equivalence relation. The proof can be found in Moser (2006), see also Appendix A.1. 2607 M OSER Theorem 8 Any kernel k : X × X → [0, 1] with k(x, x) = 1 is (at least) Tcos -transitive, where 1 − a2 Tcos (a, b) = max{a b − 1 − b2 , 0}. (6) The nomenclature is motivated by the fact that the triangular norm deﬁned by Equation (6) is an Archimedean t-norm which is generated by the arcosine function as its additive generator. From this result, the following existence theorem can be derived, which guarantees that any kernel under consideration can be represented by the fuzzy-logical formula given by (5). In fuzzy systems, this formula is commonly used for modeling rule bases (see, for example, Kruse et al., 1993, 1994). Theorem 9 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, k : X × X → [0, 1] a kernel in the sense of Deﬁnition 1 and k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X ; then there is a family of membership functions µ i : X → [0, 1], i ∈ I, I non-empty and a t-norm T , such that ↔ ∀x, y ∈ X : k(x, y) = inf T (µi (x), µi (y)). i∈I (7) Proof. Let us set I := X , µx0 (x) = k(x, x0 ) and let us choose Tcos as t-norm. For convenience let us denote ↔ h(x, y) = inf T cos (µx0 (x), µx0 (y)), x0 ∈X which is equivalent to ↔ h(x, y) = inf T cos (k(x0 , x), k(x0 , y)). x0 ∈X According to Theorem 8, k is Tcos -transitive, that is, ↔ ∀x0 , x, y ∈ X : T cos (k(x0 , x), k(x0 , y)) ≤ k(x, y). This implies that h(x, y) ≤ k(x, y) for all x, y ∈ X . Now let us consider the other inequality. Due to the adjunction property (3), we obtain → Tcos (k(x, y), k(x0 , y)) ≤ k(x, x0 ) ⇔ k(x, y) ≤ T cos (k(x0 , y), k(x, x0 )) and → Tcos (k(x, y), k(x0 , x)) ≤ k(y, x0 ) ⇔ k(x, y) ≤ T cos (k(x0 , x), k(y, x0 )), from which it follows that → → ∀x, y, x0 ∈ X : k(x, y) ≤ min{ T cos (k(x0 , y), k(x, x0 )), T cos (k(x0 , x), k(y, x0 ))}. Hence by Deﬁnition 4, ∀x, y ∈ X : k(x, y) ≤ h(x, y) which ends the proof. For an arbitrary choice of fuzzy membership functions, there is no necessity that the resulting relation (7) implies positive-semideﬁniteness and, therefore, a kernel. For an example of a Tcos equivalence which is not a kernel see Appendix A.4. Theorem 9 guarantees only the existence of a representation of the form (5) but it does not tell us how to construct the membership functions µ i . In the following section, we provide examples of fuzzy equivalence relations which yield kernels for any choice of membership functions. 2608 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS 4. Constructing Kernels by Fuzzy Equivalence Relations In the Boolean case, positive-deﬁniteness and equivalence are synonymous, that is, a Boolean relation R : X × X → {0, 1} is positive-deﬁnite if and only if R is the indicator function of an equivalence relation ∼ that is, R(x, y) = 1 if x ∼ y and R(x, y) = 0 if x ∼ y. For a proof, see Appendix A.2. This = = =, relationship can be used to obtain an extension to fuzzy relations as given by the next theorem whose proof can be found in the Appendix A.3. Theorem 10 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, µ i : X → [0, 1], i ∈ I, I non-empty; then the fuzzy equivalence relation EM : X × X → [0, 1] given by ↔ EM (x, y) = inf T M (µi (x), µi (y)) i∈I is positive-semideﬁnite. In the following, the most prominent representatives of Archimedean t-norms, the Product TP and the Łukasiewicz t-norm TL , are used to construct positive-semideﬁnite fuzzy similarity relations. Though the ﬁrst part can also be derived from a result due to Yaglom (1957) that characterizes isotropic stationary kernels by its spectral representation, here we prefer to present a direct, elementary proof. Compare also Bochner (1955) and Genton (2001). Theorem 11 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, ν : X → [0, 1] and let h : [0, 1] → [0, 1] be an isomorphism of the unit interval that can be expanded in the manner of Equation (1), that is h(x) = ∑k ck xk with ck ≥ 0; then the fuzzy equivalence relations EL,h , EP,h : X × X → [0, 1] given by ↔ EL,h (x, y) = h T L h−1 (ν(x)) , h−1 (ν(y)) and ↔ EP,h (x, y) = h T P h−1 (ν(x)) , h−1 (ν(y)) (8) (9) are positive-semideﬁnite. Proof. To prove the positive-deﬁniteness of the two-placed functions E L,h and EP,h given by equations (8) and (9) respectively, we have to show that n n ∑ i, j=1 EL,h (xi , xi ) ci c j ≥ 0, ∑ i, j=1 EP,h (xi , x j ) ci c j ≥ 0 for any n ∈ N and any choice of x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X , respectively. According to an elementary result from Linear Algebra this is equivalent to the assertion that the determinants (1 ≤ m ≤ n) Dm = det (E(xi , x j ))i, j∈{1,...,m} of the minors of the matrix (E(xi , x j ))i, j satisfy ∀m ∈ {1, . . . , n} : Dm ≥ 0, where E denotes either EL,h or EP,h . Recall that the determinant of a matrix is invariant with respect to renaming the indices, that is, if σ : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n} is a permutation then det [(ai j )i, j ] = det (aσ(i)σ( j) )i, j . 2609 M OSER For convenience, let denote µi = h−1 (ν(xi )). Then, without loss of generality, we may assume that the values µi are ordered monotonically decreasing, that is, µi ≥ µ j for i < j. ↔ → (10) → Case TL : Note that T L (a, b) = min{ T L (a, b), T L (b, a)} = 1 − |a − b|. Then we have to show that for all dimensions n ∈ N, the determinant of E (n) = (1 − |µi − µ j |)i, j∈{1,...,n} is non-negative, that is Due to the assumption (10), we have det[E (n) ] ≥ 0. 1 − |µi − µ j | = 1 − (µi − µ j ) if i ≤ j, 1 − (µ j − µi ) else which yields   . . . 1 − (µ1 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ1 − µn )  . . . 1 − (µ2 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ2 − µn )     . . . 1 − (µ3 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ3 − µn )    (n) E = . . . .. . .   . . .   1 − (µ1 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ2 − µn−1 ) . . . 1 1 − (µn−1 − µn ) 1 − (µ1 − µn ) 1 − (µ2 − µn ) . . . 1 − (µn−1 − µn ) 1 1 − (µ1 − µ2 ) 1 1 − (µ2 − µ3 ) . . . 1 1 − (µ1 − µ2 ) 1 − (µ1 − µ3 ) . . . Now let us apply determinant-invariant elementary column operations to simplify this matrix by subtracting the column with index i − 1 from the column with index i, i ≥ 2.

(12) G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS Let us apply Laplacian determinant expansion by minors to the ﬁrst column of matrix (12), that is n det[A] = ∑ (−1)i+ j ai j det[Ai j ] i=1 where A = (ai j ) is an n × n-matrix, j arbitrarily chosen from {1, . . . , n} and Ai j is the matrix corresponding to the cofactor ai j obtained by canceling out the i-th row and the j-th column from A (see, ˆ for example, Muir, 1960). For n = 1, we get the trivial case det[ E (1) ] = 1. Note that the ﬁrst and (n) ˆ the last rows of the matrices Ei,1 for 1 < i < n only differ by their signum, consequently the minors ˆ (n) det[Ei,1 ] for 1 < i < n, n ≥ 2, are vanishing, that is, det[Ai,1 ] = 0, for 1 < i < n. Therefore, according to the Laplacian expansion, we get (n) (n) ˆ ˆ ˆ det[E (n) ] = 1 · det[E1,1 ] + (−1)n (1 − (µ1 − µn )) · det[E1,n ]. (13) Observe that (n) ˆ det[E1,1 ] = 2n−2 (n) ˆ det[E1,n ] = (−1)n−1 2n−2 . Consequently, Equation (13) simpliﬁes to ˆ det[E (n) ] = 2n−2 1 + (−1)n (−1)n−1 2n−2 (1 − (µ1 − µn )) = 2n−2 (1 − (1 − (µ1 − µn ))) = 2n−2 (µ1 − µn ) ≥ 0 which together with (11) proves the ﬁrst case. ↔ → → Case TP : First of all, let us compute T P (a, b) = min{ T P (a, b), T L (b, a)}.

Again, without loss of generality, let us suppose that the values µ i , i ∈ {1, . . . , n} are ordered monotonically decreasing, that is µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ . . . ≥ µn . Before checking the general case, let us consider the special case of vanishing µ-values. For this, let us assume for the moment that µi = > 0 if i < i0 , 0 else ↔ ↔ which implies that T P (µi , µ j ) = 0 for i < i0 and j ≥ i0 and T P (µi , µ j ) = 1 for i ≥ i0 and j ≥ i0 .

By this, the determinant of the matrix in Equation (15) readily turns out to be n−1 µi+1 ˜ det[E (n) ] = det[E (n) ] = ∏ 1 − µi i=1 2 ≥0 which together with Theorem (2) ends the proof. Note that relations (8) and (9) are T -transitive with respect to the corresponding isomorphic Archimedean t-norms, TL,h (x, y) = h(TL (h−1 (x), h−1 (x))) and TP,h (x, y) = h(TP (h−1 (x), h−1 (x))), respectively. 2612 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS Corollary 12 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, µ i : X → [0, 1], λi ∈ ]0, 1] with ∑i λi = 1 ˜ ˜ where i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, n ∈ N, then the fuzzy equivalence relations EL , EP : X × X → [0, 1] given by n ↔ ˜ EL (x, y) = ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)) (16) i=1 and n ↔ ˜ EP (x, y) = ∏ T P (µi (x), µi (y)) λi (17) i=1 are TL - and TP -equivalences, respectively, and kernels. Proof. First of all, let us check the TL -transitivity of formula (16). This can readily be shown by ↔ means of the deﬁnition of TL and the TL -transitivity of T L due to the following inequalities: n TL n ↔ i=1 n n ↔ ↔ n ↔ ↔ ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)) + ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (z)) − 1 , 0 i=1 i=1 n max = i=1 i=1 n = i=1 ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)) + ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (z)) − 1, 0 max max ↔ ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)), ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (yz) n ↔ ↔ ∑ λi TL T L (µi (x), µi (y)), ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (z)) , 0 i=1 i=1 n max ↔ ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (z)), 0 ≤ ≤ = i=1 ↔ λi T L (µi (x), µi (z)). ↔ This, together with the TP -transitivity of T P , proves that the formulas given by (16) and (17) are TL and TP -equivalences, respectively. Expanding the factors of formula (17) yields  1 if µi (x) = µi (y) = 0, λi ↔ λi λi (18) T P (µi (x), µi (y)) =  min(µiλi(x),µiλi(y)) else max(µi (x),µi (y)) which by comparing case TP of the proof of Theorem 11 shows that the left-hand side of Equation (18) is positive-semideﬁnite. As the convex combination and the product are special cases of positive-semideﬁniteness preserving functions according to Theorem 1, the functions deﬁned by equations (16) and (17) prove to be again positive-semideﬁnite and, therefore, kernels. It is interesting to observe that both formulas (16) and (17) can be expressed in the form, f ( τ(x) − τ(y) 1 ), where f : I → [0, 1], I some interval, is a strictly decreasing function, τ : X → I n , I some interval, τ(x) = (τ1 (x), . . . , τn (x)) and τ(x) 1 = ∑n |τi (x)|. Indeed, for Equation (16) let us deﬁne i=1 fL : [0, 1] → [0, 1], fL (a) = 1 − a τL : X → [0, 1] , τL (x) = (λ1 µ1 (x), . . . , λn µn (x)) n 2613 M OSER and for Equation (17) and positive membership functions µ i , µi (x) > 0 for all x ∈ X , let us deﬁne fP : [0, ∞[→ [0, 1], fP (a) = e−a τP : X → ] − ∞, 1]n , τP (x) = (λ1 ln(µ1 (x)), . . . , λn ln(µn (x))) Therefore, we get ˜ EL (x, y) = 1 − τL (x) − τL (y) ˜ EP (x, y) = e− τP (x)−τP (y) 1 . 1 (19) (20) While formulas (19) and (20) provide a geometrical interpretation by means of the norm . 1 , the corresponding formulas (16) and (17) yield a semantical model of the assertion “IF x is equal to y with respect to feature µ1 AND . . . AND x is equal to y with respect to feature µn THEN x is equal to y” as aggregation of biimplications in terms of fuzzy logic. While in the former case, the aggregation has some compensatory effect, the latter is just a conjunction in terms of the Product triangular norm. For details on aggregation operators see, for example, Saminger et al. (2002) and Calvo et al. (2002). The formulas (16) and (17) coincide for the following special case. If the membership functions µi are indicator functions of sets Ai ⊆ X which form a partition of X , then the kernels (16) and (17) reduce to the indicator function characterizing the Boolean equivalence relation induced by this partition {A1 , . . . , An }. The formulas (16) and (17) for general membership functions therefore provide kernels which can be interpreted to be induced by a family of fuzzy sets and, in particular, by fuzzy partitions, that is, families of fuzzy sets fulﬁlling some criteria which extend the axioms for a Boolean partition in a many-valued logical sense. For deﬁnitions and further details on fuzzy partitions see, for ¨ example, De Baets and Mesiar (1998), Demirci (2003) and H oppner and Klawonn (2003). It is a frequently used paradigm that the decision boundaries for a classiﬁcation problem lie between clusters rather than intersecting them. Due to this cluster hypothesis, the problem of designing kernels based on fuzzy partitions is closely related to the problem of learning kernels from unlabeled data. For further details on semi-supervised learning see, for example, Seeger (2002), Chapelle et al. (2003) and T. M. Huang (2006). It is left to future research to explore this relationship to the problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data and related concepts like covariance kernels. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have presented a novel view on kernels from a fuzzy logical point of view. Particularly, the similarity-measure aspect of a kernel is addressed and investigated by means of the so-called T -transitivity which is characteristic for fuzzy equivalence relations. As a consequence, we derived that a large class of kernels can be represented in a way that is commonly used for representing fuzzy rule bases. In addition to this proof for the existence of such a representation, constructive examples are presented. It is the idea of this research to look for a combination of knowledge-based strategies with kernel-based methods in order to facilitate a more ﬂexible designing process of kernels which also allows to incorporate prior knowledge. Further research aims at 2614 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS analyzing the behavior of kernels constructed in this way when applied in the various kernel methods like support vector machines, kernel principal components analysis and others. In particular, it is intended to focus on the problem of learning kernels from unlabeled data where the fuzzy partitions are induced by appropriate clustering principles.

For sake of completeness the following sections provide proofs regarding Theorem 8, the characterization of kernels in the Boolean case and the construction of kernels by means of the minimum t-norm TM . Furthermore, in Section A.4 an example of a non-positive-semideﬁnite Tcos -equivalence is given. A.1 Proof of Theorem 8 Let us start with the analysis of 3-dimensional matrices. Lemma 13 Let M = (mi j )i j ∈ [0, 1]3×3 be a 3 × 3 symmetric matrix with mii = 1, i = 1, 2, 3; then M is positive-semideﬁnite iff for all i, j, k ∈ {1, 2, 3} there holds mi j m jk − 1 − m2j i 1 − m2 ≤ mik jk Proof. For simplicity, let a = m1,2 , b = m1,3 and c = m2,3 . Then the determinant of M, Det(M), is a function of the variables a, b, c given by D(a, b, c) = 1 + 2abc − a2 − b2 − c2 . For any choice of a, b, the quadratic equation D(a, b, c) = 0 can be solved for c, yielding two solutions c1 = c1 (a, b) and c2 = c2 (a, b) as functions of a and b, c1 (a, b) = ab − c2 (a, b) = ab + 1 − a2 1 − a2 1 − b2 1 − b2 . Obviously, for all |a| ≤ 1 and |b| ≤ 1, the values c1 (a, b) and c2 (a, b) are real. By substituting a = cos α and b = cos(β) with α, β ∈ [0, π ], it becomes readily clear that 2 c1 (a, b) = c1 (cos(α), cos(β)) = cos(α) cos(β) − sin(α) sin(β) = cos(α + β) ∈ [−1, 1] 2615 M OSER and, analogously, c2 (a, b) = c2 (cos(α), cos(β)) = cos(α) cos(β) + sin(α) sin(β) = cos(α − β) ∈ [−1, 1]. As for all a, b ∈ [−1, 1] the determinant function Da,b (c) := D(a, b, c) is quadratic in c with negative coefﬁcient for c2 , there is a uniquely determined maximum at c0 (a, b) = ab. Note that for all a, b ∈ [−1, 1], we have c1 (a, b) ≤ c0 (a, b) ≤ c2 (a, b) and D(a, b, c0 (a, b)) = 1 + 2ab(ab) − a2 − b2 − (ab)2 = (1 − a2 )(1 − b2 ) ≥ 0. Therefore, D(a, b, c) ≥ 0 if and only if c ∈ [c1 (a, b), c2 (a, b)]. Recall from linear algebra that by renaming the indices, the determinant does not change. Therefore, without loss of generality, we may assume that a ≥ b ≥ c. For convenience, let Q = {(x, y, z) ∈ [0, 1]3 |x ≥ y ≥ z}. Then, obviously, for any choice of a, b ∈ [0, 1] there holds (a, b, c1 (a, b)) ∈ Q. Elementary algebra shows that (a, b, c2 (a, b)) ∈ Q is only the case for a = b = 1. As for a = b = 1 the two solutions c1 , c2 coincide, that is, c1 (1, 1) = c2 (1, 1) = 1, it follows that for any choice of (a, b, c) ∈ Q, there holds D(a, b, c) ≥ 0 if and only if c1 (a, b) = ab − 1 − a2 1 − b2 ≤ c. (21) If (a, b, c) ∈ Q, then the inequality (21) is trivially satisﬁed which together with (21) proves the lemma Now Theorem 8 immediately follows from Deﬁnition (1), Lemma (13) and the characterizing inequality (21). A.2 Characterization of Kernels in the Boolean Case ¨ The following lemma and proposition can also be found as an exercise in Sch olkopf and Smola (2002). Lemma 14 Let ∼ be an equivalence relation on X and let k : X × X → {0, 1} be induced by ∼ via k(x, y) = 1 if and only if x ∼ y; then k is a kernel. Proof. By deﬁnition of positive-deﬁniteness, let us consider an arbitrary sequence of elements x1 , . . . , xn . Then there are at most n equivalence classes Q1 , . . . , Qm on the set of indices {1, . . . , n}, S / m ≤ n, where i=1,...,m Qi = {1, . . . , n} and Qi ∩ Q j = 0 for i = j. Note that k(xi , x j ) = 0 if the indices 2616 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS i, j belong to different equivalence classes. Then, for any choice of reals c 1 , . . . , cn , we obtain ∑ ci c j k(xi , x j ) m = i, j ∑ ∑ ci c j k(xi , x j ) p=1 i, j∈Q p m = ∑ ∑ p=1 i, j∈Q p ci c j · 1 2 m = ∑ ∑ ci p=1 i∈Q p ≥ 0 Proposition 15 k : X × X → {0, 1} with k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X is a kernel if and only if it is induced by an equivalence relation. Proof. It only remains to be shown that if k is a kernel, then it is the indicator function of an equivalence relation, that is, it is induced by an equivalence relation. If k is a kernel, according to Lemma 13, for all x, y, z ∈ X , it has to satisfy Tcos (k(x, y), k(y, z)) ≤ k(x, z), which implies, k(x, y) = 1, k(y, z) = 1 =⇒ k(x, z) = 1. Obviously, we have k(x, x) = 1 and k(x, y) = k(y, x) due to the reﬂexivity and symmetry assumption of k, respectively. A.3 Constructing Kernels by TM For convenience let us recall the basic notion of an α-cut from fuzzy set theory: Deﬁnition 16 Let X be a non-empty set and µ : X → [0, 1]; then [µ]α = {x ∈ X | µ(x) ≥ α} is called the α-cut of the membership function µ. Lemma 17 k : X × X → [0, 1] is a TM -equivalence if and only if all α-cuts of k are Boolean equivalence relations. Proof. (i) Let us assume that k is a TM -equivalence. Let α ∈ [0, 1], then by deﬁnition, [k]α = {(x, y) ∈ X × X | k(x, y) ≥ α}. In order to show that [k]α is a Boolean equivalence, the axioms for reﬂexivity, symmetry and transitivity have to be shown. Reﬂexivity and symmetry are trivially satisﬁed as for all x, y ∈ X , there holds by assumption that k(x, x) = 1 and k(x, y) = k(y, x). In order to show transitivity, let us consider (x, y), (y, z) ∈ [k]α , that means k(x, y) ≥ α and k(y, z) ≥ α; then by the TM -transitivity assumption it follows that α ≤ min(k(x, y), k(y, z)) ≤ k(x, z), hence (x, z) ∈ [k]α . 2617 M OSER (ii) Suppose now that all α-cuts of k are Boolean equivalence relations. Then, in particular, [k] α with α = 1 is reﬂexive, hence k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X . The symmetry of k follows from the fact that for all α ∈ [0, 1] and pairs (x, y) ∈ [k]α , by assumption, we have (y, x) ∈ [k]α . In order to show the TM -transitivity property, let us consider arbitrarily chosen elements x, y, z ∈ X . Let α = min(k(x, y), k(y, z)); then by the transitivity assumption of [k] α , it follows that (x, z) ∈ [k]α , consequently k(x, z) ≥ α = min(k(x, y), k(y, z)). Proposition 18 If k : X × X → [0, 1] is a TM -equivalence then it is positive-semideﬁnite. Proof. Choose arbitrary elements x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X and consider the set of values which are taken by all combinations k(xi , x j ), i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} and order them increasingly, that is k(xi , x j )| i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}} = {α1 , . . . , αm , where 0 ≤ α1 ≤ · · · αm ≤ 1. Observe that for all pairs (xi , x j ), i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} there holds m k(xi , x j ) = ∑ (αv − αv−1 )1[k] αv v=2 (xi , x j ) + α1 1[k]α1 (xi , x j ) showing that on the set {x1 , . . . , xn } × {x1 , . . . , xn }, the function k is a linear combination of indicator functions of Boolean equivalences (which are positive-semideﬁnite by Proposition 15) with nonnegative coefﬁcients and, consequently, it has to be positive semideﬁnite. A.4 Example of a Non-Positive-Semideﬁnite Tcos -Equivalence For dimensions n > 3, the Tcos -transitivity is no longer sufﬁcient to guarantee positive semi(n) deﬁniteness. Consider, for example An = (ai j )i j where  λ  (n) ai j = 1   0 if min(i, j) = 1, max(i, j) > 1 , if i = j, else . (22) √ (n) (n) (n) Choose λ = 1/ 2, then Tcos (λ, λ) = 0, hence we have Tcos (ai j , a jk ) ≤ aik for all indices i, j, k ∈ 1, . . . , n. As det(An ) < 0 for n > 3, the matrix An cannot be positive-semideﬁnite though the Tcos transitivity conditions are satisﬁed. References S. Bochner. Harmonic Analysis and the Theory of Probability.

<p>Author: Régis Vert, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We determine the asymptotic behaviour of the function computed by support vector machines (SVM) and related algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical convex loss function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian RBF kernel, in the situation where the number of examples tends to inﬁnity, the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel tends to 0, and the regularization parameter is held ﬁxed. Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the ﬁrst time to be a consistent density level set estimator.

<p>Author: Luis M. de Campos</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new scoring function for learning Bayesian networks from data using score+search algorithms. This is based on the concept of mutual information and exploits some well-known properties of this measure in a novel way. Essentially, a statistical independence test based on the chi-square distribution, associated with the mutual information measure, together with a property of additive decomposition of this measure, are combined in order to measure the degree of interaction between each variable and its parent variables in the network. The result is a non-Bayesian scoring function called MIT (mutual information tests) which belongs to the family of scores based on information theory. The MIT score also represents a penalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probability distributions associated with a candidate network and with the available data set. Detailed results of a complete experimental evaluation of the proposed scoring function and its comparison with the well-known K2, BDeu and BIC/MDL scores are also presented.

<p>Author: Guillaume Lecué</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we prove the optimality of an aggregation procedure. We prove lower bounds for aggregation of model selection type of M density estimators for the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL), the Hellinger’s distance and the L1 -distance. The lower bound, with respect to the KL distance, can be achieved by the on-line type estimate suggested, among others, by Yang (2000a). Combining these results, we state that log M/n is an optimal rate of aggregation in the sense of Tsybakov (2003), where n is the sample size.

<p>Author: Di-Rong Chen, Tao Sun</p><p>Abstract: The consistency of classiﬁcation algorithm plays a central role in statistical learning theory. A consistent algorithm guarantees us that taking more samples essentially sufﬁces to roughly reconstruct the unknown distribution. We consider the consistency of ERM scheme over classes of combinations of very simple rules (base classiﬁers) in multiclass classiﬁcation. Our approach is, under some mild conditions, to establish a quantitative relationship between classiﬁcation errors and convex risks. In comparison with the related previous work, the feature of our result is that the conditions are mainly expressed in terms of the differences between some values of the convex function.

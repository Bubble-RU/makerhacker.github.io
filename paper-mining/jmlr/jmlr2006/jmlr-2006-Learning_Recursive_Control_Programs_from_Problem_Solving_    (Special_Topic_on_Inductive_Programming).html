<p>Author: Andrea Passerini, Paolo Frasconi, Luc De Raedt</p><p>Abstract: We develop kernels for measuring the similarity between relational instances using background knowledge expressed in ﬁrst-order logic. The method allows us to bridge the gap between traditional inductive logic programming (ILP) representations and statistical approaches to supervised learning. Logic programs are ﬁrst used to generate proofs of given visitor programs that use predicates declared in the available background knowledge. A kernel is then deﬁned over pairs of proof trees. The method can be used for supervised learning tasks and is suitable for classiﬁcation as well as regression. We report positive empirical results on Bongard-like and M-of-N problems that are difﬁcult or impossible to solve with traditional ILP techniques, as well as on real bioinformatics and chemoinformatics data sets.

<p>Author: Greg Hamerly, Erez Perelman, Jeremy Lau, Brad Calder, Timothy Sherwood</p><p>Abstract: An essential step in designing a new computer architecture is the careful examination of different design options. It is critical that computer architects have efﬁcient means by which they may estimate the impact of various design options on the overall machine. This task is complicated by the fact that different programs, and even different parts of the same program, may have distinct behaviors that interact with the hardware in different ways. Researchers use very detailed simulators to estimate processor performance, which models every cycle of an executing program. Unfortunately, simulating every cycle of a real program can take weeks or months. To address this problem we have created a tool called SimPoint that uses data clustering algorithms from machine learning to automatically ﬁnd repetitive patterns in a program’s execution. By simulating one representative of each repetitive behavior pattern, simulation time can be reduced to minutes instead of weeks for standard benchmark programs, with very little cost in terms of accuracy. We describe this important problem, the data representation and preprocessing methods used by SimPoint, the clustering algorithm at the core of SimPoint, and we evaluate different options for tuning SimPoint.

<p>Author: Jelle R. Kok, Nikos Vlassis</p><p>Abstract: In this article we describe a set of scalable techniques for learning the behavior of a group of agents in a collaborative multiagent setting. As a basis we use the framework of coordination graphs of Guestrin, Koller, and Parr (2002a) which exploits the dependencies between agents to decompose the global payoff function into a sum of local terms. First, we deal with the single-state case and describe a payoff propagation algorithm that computes the individual actions that approximately maximize the global payoff function. The method can be viewed as the decision-making analogue of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Second, we focus on learning the behavior of the agents in sequential decision-making tasks. We introduce different model-free reinforcementlearning techniques, unitedly called Sparse Cooperative Q-learning, which approximate the global action-value function based on the topology of a coordination graph, and perform updates using the contribution of the individual agents to the maximal global action value. The combined use of an edge-based decomposition of the action-value function and the payoff propagation algorithm for efﬁcient action selection, result in an approach that scales only linearly in the problem size. We provide experimental evidence that our method outperforms related multiagent reinforcement-learning methods based on temporal differences.

<p>Author: Emanuel Kitzelmann, Ute Schmid</p><p>Abstract: We describe an approach to the inductive synthesis of recursive equations from input/outputexamples which is based on the classical two-step approach to induction of functional Lisp programs of Summers (1977). In a ﬁrst step, I/O-examples are rewritten to traces which explain the outputs given the respective inputs based on a datatype theory. These traces can be integrated into one conditional expression which represents a non-recursive program. In a second step, this initial program term is generalized into recursive equations by searching for syntactical regularities in the term. Our approach extends the classical work in several aspects. The most important extensions are that we are able to induce a set of recursive equations in one synthesizing step, the equations may contain more than one recursive call, and additionally needed parameters are automatically introduced.

<p>Author: Pat Langley, Dongkyu Choi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new representation for physical control – teleoreactive logic programs – along with an interpreter that uses them to achieve goals. In addition, we present a new learning method that acquires recursive forms of these structures from traces of successful problem solving. We report experiments in three different domains that demonstrate the generality of this approach. In closing, we review related work on learning complex skills and discuss directions for future research on this topic.

<p>Author: Dmitry M. Malioutov, Jason K. Johnson, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We present a new framework based on walks in a graph for analysis and inference in Gaussian graphical models. The key idea is to decompose the correlation between each pair of variables as a sum over all walks between those variables in the graph. The weight of each walk is given by a product of edgewise partial correlation coefﬁcients. This representation holds for a large class of Gaussian graphical models which we call walk-summable. We give a precise characterization of this class of models, and relate it to other classes including diagonally dominant, attractive, nonfrustrated, and pairwise-normalizable. We provide a walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian belief propagation in trees and of the approximate method of loopy belief propagation in graphs with cycles. The walk-sum perspective leads to a better understanding of Gaussian belief propagation and to stronger results for its convergence in loopy graphs.

<p>Author: Jelle R. Kok, Nikos Vlassis</p><p>Abstract: In this article we describe a set of scalable techniques for learning the behavior of a group of agents in a collaborative multiagent setting. As a basis we use the framework of coordination graphs of Guestrin, Koller, and Parr (2002a) which exploits the dependencies between agents to decompose the global payoff function into a sum of local terms. First, we deal with the single-state case and describe a payoff propagation algorithm that computes the individual actions that approximately maximize the global payoff function. The method can be viewed as the decision-making analogue of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Second, we focus on learning the behavior of the agents in sequential decision-making tasks. We introduce different model-free reinforcementlearning techniques, unitedly called Sparse Cooperative Q-learning, which approximate the global action-value function based on the topology of a coordination graph, and perform updates using the contribution of the individual agents to the maximal global action value. The combined use of an edge-based decomposition of the action-value function and the payoff propagation algorithm for efﬁcient action selection, result in an approach that scales only linearly in the problem size. We provide experimental evidence that our method outperforms related multiagent reinforcement-learning methods based on temporal differences.

<p>Author: Dana Angluin, Jiang Chen</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a hypergraph using edge-detecting queries. In this model, the learner may query whether a set of vertices induces an edge of the hidden hypergraph or not. We show that an r-uniform hypergraph with m edges and n vertices is learnable with O(2 4r m · poly(r, log n)) queries with high probability. The queries can be made in O(min(2 r (log m + r)2 , (log m + r)3 )) rounds. We also give an algorithm that learns an almost uniform hypergraph of ∆ ∆ dimension r using O(2O((1+ 2 )r) · m1+ 2 · poly(log n)) queries with high probability, where ∆ is the difference between the maximum and the minimum edge sizes. This upper bound matches our ∆ lower bound of Ω(( m∆ )1+ 2 ) for this class of hypergraphs in terms of dependence on m. The 1+ 2 queries can also be made in O((1 + ∆) · min(2r (log m + r)2 , (log m + r)3 )) rounds.

<p>Author: S. V. N. Vishwanathan, Nicol N. Schraudolph, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an online support vector machine (SVM) that uses the stochastic meta-descent (SMD) algorithm to adapt its step size automatically. We formulate the online learning problem as a stochastic gradient descent in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and translate SMD to the nonparametric setting, where its gradient trace parameter is no longer a coefﬁcient vector but an element of the RKHS. We derive efﬁcient updates that allow us to perform the step size adaptation in linear time. We apply the online SVM framework to a variety of loss functions, and in particular show how to handle structured output spaces and achieve efﬁcient online multiclass classiﬁcation. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms more primitive methods for setting the gradient step size.

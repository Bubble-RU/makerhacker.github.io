This work focuses on the design and analysis of efﬁcient incremental SVM learning, with the aim of providing a fast, numerically stable and robust implementation. A detailed analysis of convergence and of algorithmic complexity of incremental SVM learning is carried out. Based on this analysis, a new design of storage and numerical operations is proposed, which speeds up the training of an incremental SVM by a factor of 5 to 20.

<p>Author: Sören Sonnenburg, Gunnar Rätsch, Christin Schäfer, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: While classical kernel-based learning algorithms are based on a single kernel, in practice it is often desirable to use multiple kernels. Lanckriet et al. (2004) considered conic combinations of kernel matrices for classiﬁcation, leading to a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. We show that it can be rewritten as a semi-inﬁnite linear program that can be efﬁciently solved by recycling the standard SVM implementations. Moreover, we generalize the formulation and our method to a larger class of problems, including regression and one-class classiﬁcation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm works for hundred thousands of examples or hundreds of kernels to be combined, and helps for automatic model selection, improving the interpretability of the learning result. In a second part we discuss general speed up mechanism for SVMs, especially when used with sparse feature maps as appear for string kernels, allowing us to train a string kernel SVM on a 10 million real-world splice data set from computational biology. We integrated multiple kernel learning in our machine learning toolbox SHOGUN for which the source code is publicly available at http://www.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/raetsch/projects/shogun.

<p>Author: Seyoung Kim, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a general probabilistic framework for shape-based modeling and classiﬁcation of waveform data. A segmental hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to characterize waveform shape and shape variation is captured by adding random effects to the segmental model. The resulting probabilistic framework provides a basis for learning of waveform models from data as well as parsing and recognition of new waveforms. Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms are derived and investigated for ﬁtting such models to data. In particular, the “expectation conditional maximization either” (ECME) algorithm is shown to provide signiﬁcantly faster convergence than a standard EM procedure. Experimental results on two real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to improved accuracy in classiﬁcation and segmentation when compared to alternatives such as Euclidean distance matching, dynamic time warping, and segmental HMMs without random effects.

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering refers to a class of techniques which rely on the eigenstructure of a similarity matrix to partition points into disjoint clusters, with points in the same cluster having high similarity and points in different clusters having low similarity. In this paper, we derive new cost functions for spectral clustering based on measures of error between a given partition and a solution of the spectral relaxation of a minimum normalized cut problem. Minimizing these cost functions with respect to the partition leads to new spectral clustering algorithms. Minimizing with respect to the similarity matrix leads to algorithms for learning the similarity matrix from fully labelled data sets. We apply our learning algorithm to the blind one-microphone speech separation problem, casting the problem as one of segmentation of the spectrogram.

<p>Author: S. Sathiya Keerthi, Olivier Chapelle, Dennis DeCoste</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs), though accurate, are not preferred in applications requiring great classiﬁcation speed, due to the number of support vectors being large. To overcome this problem we devise a primal method with the following properties: (1) it decouples the idea of basis functions from the concept of support vectors; (2) it greedily ﬁnds a set of kernel basis functions of a speciﬁed maximum size (dmax ) to approximate the SVM primal cost function well; (3) it is 2 efﬁcient and roughly scales as O(ndmax ) where n is the number of training examples; and, (4) the number of basis functions it requires to achieve an accuracy close to the SVM accuracy is usually far less than the number of SVM support vectors.

<p>Author: Peter Bühlmann, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: We propose Sparse Boosting (the SparseL2 Boost algorithm), a variant on boosting with the squared error loss. SparseL2 Boost yields sparser solutions than the previously proposed L2 Boosting by minimizing some penalized L2 -loss functions, the FPE model selection criteria, through smallstep gradient descent. Although boosting may give already relatively sparse solutions, for example corresponding to the soft-thresholding estimator in orthogonal linear models, there is sometimes a desire for more sparseness to increase prediction accuracy and ability for better variable selection: such goals can be achieved with SparseL2 Boost. We prove an equivalence of SparseL2 Boost to Breiman’s nonnegative garrote estimator for orthogonal linear models and demonstrate the generic nature of SparseL2 Boost for nonparametric interaction modeling. For an automatic selection of the tuning parameter in SparseL2 Boost we propose to employ the gMDL model selection criterion which can also be used for early stopping of L2 Boosting. Consequently, we can select between SparseL2 Boost and L2 Boosting by comparing their gMDL scores.

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, David Heckerman, Eric Horvitz</p><p>Abstract: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are a standard way to display the performance of a set of binary classiﬁers for all feasible ratios of the costs associated with false positives and false negatives. For linear classiﬁers, the set of classiﬁers is typically obtained by training once, holding constant the estimated slope and then varying the intercept to obtain a parameterized set of classiﬁers whose performances can be plotted in the ROC plane. We consider the alternative of varying the asymmetry of the cost function used for training. We show that the ROC curve obtained by varying both the intercept and the asymmetry, and hence the slope, always outperforms the ROC curve obtained by varying only the intercept. In addition, we present a path-following algorithm for the support vector machine (SVM) that can compute efﬁciently the entire ROC curve, and that has the same computational complexity as training a single classiﬁer. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the asymmetric cost model assumed when training a classiﬁer and the cost model assumed in applying the classiﬁer. In particular, we show that the mismatch between the step function used for testing and its convex upper bounds, usually used for training, leads to a provable and quantiﬁable difference around extreme asymmetries.

<p>Author: Clayton D. Scott, Robert D. Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Given a probability measure P and a reference measure µ, one is often interested in the minimum µ-measure set with P-measure at least α. Minimum volume sets of this type summarize the regions of greatest probability mass of P, and are useful for detecting anomalies and constructing conﬁdence regions. This paper addresses the problem of estimating minimum volume sets based on independent samples distributed according to P. Other than these samples, no other information is available regarding P, but the reference measure µ is assumed to be known. We introduce rules for estimating minimum volume sets that parallel the empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization principles in classiﬁcation. As in classiﬁcation, we show that the performances of our estimators are controlled by the rate of uniform convergence of empirical to true probabilities over the class from which the estimator is drawn. Thus we obtain ﬁnite sample size performance bounds in terms of VC dimension and related quantities. We also demonstrate strong universal consistency, an oracle inequality, and rates of convergence. The proposed estimators are illustrated with histogram and decision tree set estimation rules.

<p>Author: Jelle R. Kok, Nikos Vlassis</p><p>Abstract: In this article we describe a set of scalable techniques for learning the behavior of a group of agents in a collaborative multiagent setting. As a basis we use the framework of coordination graphs of Guestrin, Koller, and Parr (2002a) which exploits the dependencies between agents to decompose the global payoff function into a sum of local terms. First, we deal with the single-state case and describe a payoff propagation algorithm that computes the individual actions that approximately maximize the global payoff function. The method can be viewed as the decision-making analogue of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Second, we focus on learning the behavior of the agents in sequential decision-making tasks. We introduce different model-free reinforcementlearning techniques, unitedly called Sparse Cooperative Q-learning, which approximate the global action-value function based on the topology of a coordination graph, and perform updates using the contribution of the individual agents to the maximal global action value. The combined use of an edge-based decomposition of the action-value function and the payoff propagation algorithm for efﬁcient action selection, result in an approach that scales only linearly in the problem size. We provide experimental evidence that our method outperforms related multiagent reinforcement-learning methods based on temporal differences.

<p>Author: Janez Demšar</p><p>Abstract: While methods for comparing two learning algorithms on a single data set have been scrutinized for quite some time already, the issue of statistical tests for comparisons of more algorithms on multiple data sets, which is even more essential to typical machine learning studies, has been all but ignored. This article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classiﬁers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classiﬁers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classiﬁers over multiple data sets. Results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD (critical difference) diagrams.

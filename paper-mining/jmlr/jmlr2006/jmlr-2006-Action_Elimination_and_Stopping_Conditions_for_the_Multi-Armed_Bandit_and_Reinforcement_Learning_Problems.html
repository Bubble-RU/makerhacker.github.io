<p>Author: Jelle R. Kok, Nikos Vlassis</p><p>Abstract: In this article we describe a set of scalable techniques for learning the behavior of a group of agents in a collaborative multiagent setting. As a basis we use the framework of coordination graphs of Guestrin, Koller, and Parr (2002a) which exploits the dependencies between agents to decompose the global payoff function into a sum of local terms. First, we deal with the single-state case and describe a payoff propagation algorithm that computes the individual actions that approximately maximize the global payoff function. The method can be viewed as the decision-making analogue of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Second, we focus on learning the behavior of the agents in sequential decision-making tasks. We introduce different model-free reinforcementlearning techniques, unitedly called Sparse Cooperative Q-learning, which approximate the global action-value function based on the topology of a coordination graph, and perform updates using the contribution of the individual agents to the maximal global action value. The combined use of an edge-based decomposition of the action-value function and the payoff propagation algorithm for efﬁcient action selection, result in an approach that scales only linearly in the problem size. We provide experimental evidence that our method outperforms related multiagent reinforcement-learning methods based on temporal differences.

<p>Author: Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Policy search is a method for approximately solving an optimal control problem by performing a parametric optimization search in a given class of parameterized policies. In order to process a local optimization technique, such as a gradient method, we wish to evaluate the sensitivity of the performance measure with respect to the policy parameters, the so-called policy gradient. This paper is concerned with the estimation of the policy gradient for continuous-time, deterministic state dynamics, in a reinforcement learning framework, that is, when the decision maker does not have a model of the state dynamics. We show that usual likelihood ratio methods used in discrete-time, fail to proceed the gradient because they are subject to variance explosion when the discretization time-step decreases to 0. We describe an alternative approach based on the approximation of the pathwise derivative, which leads to a policy gradient estimate that converges almost surely to the true gradient when the timestep tends to 0. The underlying idea starts with the derivation of an explicit representation of the policy gradient using pathwise derivation. This derivation makes use of the knowledge of the state dynamics. Then, in order to estimate the gradient from the observable data only, we use a stochastic policy to discretize the continuous deterministic system into a stochastic discrete process, which enables to replace the unknown coefﬁcients by quantities that solely depend on known data. We prove the almost sure convergence of this estimate to the true policy gradient when the discretization time-step goes to zero. The method is illustrated on two target problems, in discrete and continuous control spaces. Keywords: optimal control, reinforcement learning, policy search, sensitivity analysis, parametric optimization, gradient estimate, likelihood ratio method, pathwise derivation 1. Introduction and Statement of the Problem We consider an optimal control problem with continuous state (xt ∈ IRd )t≥0 whose state dynamics is deﬁned according to the controlled differential equation: dxt = f (xt , ut ), dt (1) where the control (ut )t≥0 is a Lebesgue measurable function with values in a control space U. Note that the state-dynamics f may also depend on time, but we omit this dependency in the notation, for simplicity. We intend to maximize a functional J that depends on the trajectory (xt )0≤t≤T over a ﬁnite-time horizon T > 0. For simplicity, in the paper, we illustrate the case of a terminal reward c 2006 Rémi Munos. M UNOS only: J(x; (ut )t≥0 ) := r(xT ), (2) where r : IRd → IR is the reward function. Extension to the case of general functional of the kind J(x; (ut )t≥0 ) = Z T 0 r(t, xt )dt + R(xT ), (3) with r and R being current and terminal reward functions, would easily follow, as indicated in Remark 1. The optimal control problem of ﬁnding a control (ut )t≥0 that maximizes the functional is replaced by a parametric optimization problem for which we search for a good feed-back control law in a given class of parameterized policies {πα : [0, T ] × IRd → U}α , where α ∈ IRm is the parameter. The control ut ∈ U (or action) at time t is ut = πα (t, xt ), and we may write the dynamics of the resulting feed-back system as dxt = fα (xt ), (4) dt where fα (xt ) := f (x, πα (t, x)). In the paper, we will make the assumption that fα is C 2 , with bounded derivatives. Let us deﬁne the performance measure V (α) := J(x; πα (t, xt )t≥0 ), where its dependency with respect to (w.r.t.) the parameter α is emphasized. One may also consider an average performance measure according to some distribution µ for the initial state: V (α) := E[J(x; πα (t, xt )t≥0 )|x ∼ µ]. In order to ﬁnd a local maximum of V (α), one may perform a local search, such as a gradient ascent method α ← α + η∇αV (α), (5) with an adequate step η (see for example (Polyak, 1987; Kushner and Yin, 1997)). The computation of the gradient ∇αV (α) is the object of this paper. A ﬁrst method would be to approximate the gradient by a ﬁnite-difference quotient for each of the m components of the parameter: V (α + εei ) −V (α) , ε for some small value of ε (we use the notation ∂α instead of ∇α to indicate that it is a singledimensional derivative). This ﬁnite-difference method requires the simulation of m + 1 trajectories to compute an approximation of the true gradient. When the number of parameters is large, this may be computationally expensive. However, this simple method may be efﬁcient if the number of parameters is relatively small. In the rest of the paper we will not consider this approach, and will aim at computing the gradient using one trajectory only. ∂αi V (α) ≃ 772 P OLICY G RADIENT IN C ONTINUOUS T IME Pathwise estimation of the gradient. We now illustrate that if the decision-maker has access to a model of the state dynamics, then a pathwise derivation would directly lead to the policy gradient. Indeed, let us deﬁne the gradient of the state with respect to the parameter: zt := ∇α xt (i.e. zt is deﬁned as a d × m-matrix whose (i, j)-component is the derivative of the ith component of xt w.r.t. α j ). Our smoothness assumption on fα allows to differentiate the state dynamics (4) w.r.t. α, which provides the dynamics on (zt ): dzt = ∇α fα (xt ) + ∇x fα (xt )zt , dt (6) where the coefﬁcients ∇α fα and ∇x fα are, respectively, the derivatives of f w.r.t. the parameter (matrix of size d × m) and the state (matrix of size d × d). The initial condition for z is z0 = 0. When the reward function r is smooth (i.e. continuously differentiable), one may apply a pathwise differentiation to derive a gradient formula (see e.g. (Bensoussan, 1988) or (Yang and Kushner, 1991) for an extension to the stochastic case): ∇αV (α) = ∇x r(xT )zT . (7) Remark 1 In the more general setting of a functional (3), the gradient is deduced (by linearity) from the above formula: ∇αV (α) = Z T 0 ∇x r(t, xt )zt dt + ∇x R(xT )zT . What is known from the agent? The decision maker (call it the agent) that intends to design a good controller for the dynamical system may or may not know a model of the state dynamics f . In case the dynamics is known, the state gradient zt = ∇α xt may be computed from (6) along the trajectory and the gradient of the performance measure w.r.t. the parameter α is deduced at time T from (7), which allows to perform the gradient ascent step (5). However, in this paper we consider a Reinforcement Learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998) setting in which the state dynamics is unknown from the agent, but we still assume that the state is fully observable. The agent knows only the response of the system to its control. To be more precise, the available information to the agent at time t is its own control policy πα and the trajectory (xs )0≤s≤t up to time t. At time T , the agent receives the reward r(xT ) and, in this paper, we assume that the gradient ∇r(xT ) is available to the agent. From this point of view, it seems impossible to derive the state gradient zt from (6), since ∇α f and ∇x f are unknown. The term ∇x f (xt ) may be approximated by a least squares method from the observation of past states (xs )s≤t , as this will be explained later on in subsection 3.2. However the term ∇α f (xt ) cannot be calculated analogously. In this paper, we introduce the idea of using stochastic policies to approximate the state (xt ) and the state gradient (zt ) by discrete-time stochastic processes (Xt∆ ) and (Zt∆ ) (with ∆ being some discretization time-step). We show how Zt∆ can be computed without the knowledge of ∇α f , but only from information available to the agent. ∆ ∆ We prove the convergence (with probability one) of the gradient estimate ∇x r(XT )ZT derived from the stochastic processes to ∇αV (α) when ∆ → 0. Here, almost sure convergence is obtained using the concentration of measure phenomenon (Talagrand, 1996; Ledoux, 2001). 773 M UNOS y ∆ XT ∆ X t2 ∆ Xt 0 fα ∆ x Xt 1 Figure 1: A trajectory (Xt∆ )0≤n≤N and the state dynamics vector fα of the continuous process n (xt )0≤t≤T . Likelihood ratio method? It is worth mentioning that this strong convergence result contrasts with the usual likelihood ratio method (also called score method) in discrete time (see e.g. (Reiman and Weiss, 1986; Glynn, 1987) or more recently in the reinforcement learning literature (Williams, 1992; Sutton et al., 2000; Baxter and Bartlett, 2001; Marbach and Tsitsiklis, 2003)) for which the policy gradient estimate is subject to variance explosion when the discretization time-step ∆ tends to 0. The intuitive reason for that problem lies in the fact that the number of decisions before getting the reward grows to inﬁnity when ∆ → 0 (the variance of likelihood ratio estimates being usually linear with the number of decisions). Let us illustrate this problem on a simple 2 dimensional process. Consider the deterministic continuous process (xt )0≤t≤1 deﬁned by the state dynamics: dxt = fα := dt α 1−α , (8) (0 < α < 1) with initial condition x0 = (0 0)′ (where ′ denotes the transpose operator). The performance measure V (α) is the reward at the terminal state at time T = 1, with the reward function being the ﬁrst coordinate of the state r((x y)′ ) := x. Thus V (α) = r(xT =1 ) = α and its derivative is ∇αV (α) = 1. Let (Xt∆ )0≤n≤N ∈ IR2 be a discrete time stochastic process (the discrete times being {tn = n ∆ n∆}n=0...N with the discretization time-step ∆ = 1/N) that starts from initial state X0 = x0 = (0 0)′ and makes N random moves of length ∆ towards the right (action u1 ) or the top (action u2 ) (see Figure 1) according to the stochastic policy (i.e., the probability of choosing the actions in each state x) πα (u1 |x) = α, πα (u2 |x) = 1 − α. The process is thus deﬁned according to the dynamics: Xt∆ = Xt∆ + n n+1 Un 1 −Un ∆, (9) where (Un )0≤n < N and all ∞ N > 0), there exists a constant C that does not depend on N such that dn ≤ C/N. Thus we may take D2 = C2 /N. Now, from the previous paragraph, ||E[XN ] − xN || ≤ e(N), with e(N) → 0 when N → ∞. This means that ||h − E[h]|| + e(N) ≥ ||XN − xN ||, thus P(||h − E[h]|| ≥ ε + e(N)) ≥ P(||XN − xN || ≥ ε), and we deduce from (31) that 2 /(2C 2 ) P(||XN − xN || ≥ ε) ≤ 2e−N(ε+e(N)) . Thus, for all ε > 0, the series ∑N≥0 P(||XN − xN || ≥ ε) converges. Now, from Borel-Cantelli lemma, we deduce that for all ε > 0, there exists Nε such that for all N ≥ Nε , ||XN − xN || < ε, which ∆→0 proves the almost sure convergence of XN to xN as N → ∞ (i.e. XT −→ xT almost surely). Appendix C. Proof of Proposition 8 ′ First, note that Qt = X X ′ − X X is a symmetric, non-negative matrix, since it may be rewritten as 1 nt ∑ (Xs+ − X)(Xs+ − X)′ . s∈S(t) In solving the least squares problem (21), we deduce b = ∆X + AX∆, thus min A,b 1 1 ∑ ∆Xs − b −A(Xs+2 ∆Xs )∆ nt s∈S(t) ≤ 2 = min A 1 ∑ ∆Xs − ∆X − A(Xs+ − X)∆ nt s∈S(t) 1 ∑ ∆Xs− ∆X− ∇x f (X, ut )(Xs+− X)∆ nt s∈S(t) 2 2 . (32) Now, since Xs = X + O(∆) one may obtain like in (19) and (20) (by replacing Xt by X) that: ∆Xs − ∆X − ∇x f (X, ut )(Xs+ − X)∆ = O(∆3 ). (33) We deduce from (32) and (33) that 1 nt ∑ ∇x f (Xt , ut ) − ∇x f (X, ut ) (Xs+ − X)∆ 2 = O(∆6 ). s∈S(t) By developing each component, d ∑ ∇x f (Xt , ut ) − ∇x f (X, ut ) i=1 row i Qt ∇x f (Xt , ut ) − ∇x f (X, ut ) ′ row i = O(∆4 ). Now, from the deﬁnition of ν(∆), for all vector u ∈ IRd , u′ Qt u ≥ ν(∆)||u||2 , thus ν(∆)||∇x f (Xt , ut ) − ∇x f (X, ut )||2 = O(∆4 ). Condition (23) yields ∇x f (Xt , ut ) = ∇x f (X, ut ) + o(1), and since ∇x f (Xt , ut ) = ∇x f (X, ut ) + O(∆), we deduce lim ∇x f (Xt , ut ) = ∇x f (Xt , ut ). ∆→0 789 M UNOS References J.

<p>Author: Anders Jonsson, Andrew Barto</p><p>Abstract: We present Variable Inﬂuence Structure Analysis, or VISA, an algorithm that performs hierarchical decomposition of factored Markov decision processes. VISA uses a dynamic Bayesian network model of actions, and constructs a causal graph that captures relationships between state variables. In tasks with sparse causal graphs VISA exploits structure by introducing activities that cause the values of state variables to change. The result is a hierarchy of activities that together represent a solution to the original task. VISA performs state abstraction for each activity by ignoring irrelevant state variables and lower-level activities. In addition, we describe an algorithm for constructing compact models of the activities introduced. State abstraction and compact activity models enable VISA to apply efﬁcient algorithms to solve the stand-alone subtask associated with each activity. Experimental results show that the decomposition introduced by VISA can signiﬁcantly accelerate construction of an optimal, or near-optimal, policy.

<p>Author: Josep M. Porta, Nikos Vlassis, Matthijs T.J. Spaan, Pascal Poupart</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to optimize Partially Observable Markov Decisions Processes (POMDPs) deﬁned on continuous spaces. To date, most algorithms for model-based POMDPs are restricted to discrete states, actions, and observations, but many real-world problems such as, for instance, robot navigation, are naturally deﬁned on continuous spaces. In this work, we demonstrate that the value function for continuous POMDPs is convex in the beliefs over continuous state spaces, and piecewise-linear convex for the particular case of discrete observations and actions but still continuous states. We also demonstrate that continuous Bellman backups are contracting and isotonic ensuring the monotonic convergence of value-iteration algorithms. Relying on those properties, we extend the P ERSEUS algorithm, originally developed for discrete POMDPs, to work in continuous state spaces by representing the observation, transition, and reward models using Gaussian mixtures, and the beliefs using Gaussian mixtures or particle sets. With these representations, the integrals that appear in the Bellman backup can be computed in closed form and, therefore, the algorithm is computationally feasible. Finally, we further extend P ERSEUS to deal with continuous action and observation sets by designing effective sampling approaches.

<p>Author: Eyal Even-Dar, Shie Mannor, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We incorporate statistical conﬁdence intervals in both the multi-armed bandit and the reinforcement learning problems. In the bandit problem we show that given n arms, it sufﬁces to pull the arms a total of O (n/ε2 ) log(1/δ) times to ﬁnd an ε-optimal arm with probability of at least 1 − δ. This bound matches the lower bound of Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) up to constants. We also devise action elimination procedures in reinforcement learning algorithms. We describe a framework that is based on learning the conﬁdence interval around the value function or the Q-function and eliminating actions that are not optimal (with high probability). We provide a model-based and a model-free variants of the elimination method. We further derive stopping conditions guaranteeing that the learned policy is approximately optimal with high probability. Simulations demonstrate a considerable speedup and added robustness over ε-greedy Q-learning.</p><p>2 0.62836009 <a title="10-lsi-2" href="./jmlr-2006-Causal_Graph_Based_Decomposition_of_Factored_MDPs.html">19 jmlr-2006-Causal Graph Based Decomposition of Factored MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Anders Jonsson, Andrew Barto</p><p>Abstract: We present Variable Inﬂuence Structure Analysis, or VISA, an algorithm that performs hierarchical decomposition of factored Markov decision processes. VISA uses a dynamic Bayesian network model of actions, and constructs a causal graph that captures relationships between state variables. In tasks with sparse causal graphs VISA exploits structure by introducing activities that cause the values of state variables to change. The result is a hierarchy of activities that together represent a solution to the original task. VISA performs state abstraction for each activity by ignoring irrelevant state variables and lower-level activities. In addition, we describe an algorithm for constructing compact models of the activities introduced. State abstraction and compact activity models enable VISA to apply efﬁcient algorithms to solve the stand-alone subtask associated with each activity. Experimental results show that the decomposition introduced by VISA can signiﬁcantly accelerate construction of an optimal, or near-optimal, policy.

<p>Author: Shimon Whiteson, Peter Stone</p><p>Abstract: Temporal difference methods are theoretically grounded and empirically effective methods for addressing reinforcement learning problems. In most real-world reinforcement learning tasks, TD methods require a function approximator to represent the value function. However, using function approximators requires manually making crucial representational decisions. This paper investigates evolutionary function approximation, a novel approach to automatically selecting function approximator representations that enable efﬁcient individual learning. This method evolves individuals that are better able to learn. We present a fully implemented instantiation of evolutionary function approximation which combines NEAT, a neuroevolutionary optimization technique, with Q-learning, a popular TD method. The resulting NEAT+Q algorithm automatically discovers effective representations for neural network function approximators. This paper also presents on-line evolutionary computation, which improves the on-line performance of evolutionary computation by borrowing selection mechanisms used in TD methods to choose individual actions and using them in evolutionary computation to select policies for evaluation. We evaluate these contributions with extended empirical studies in two domains: 1) the mountain car task, a standard reinforcement learning benchmark on which neural network function approximators have previously performed poorly and 2) server job scheduling, a large probabilistic domain drawn from the ﬁeld of autonomic computing. The results demonstrate that evolutionary function approximation can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of TD methods and on-line evolutionary computation can signiﬁcantly improve evolutionary methods. This paper also presents additional tests that offer insight into what factors can make neural network function approximation difﬁcult in practice.

<p>Author: Josep M. Porta, Nikos Vlassis, Matthijs T.J. Spaan, Pascal Poupart</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to optimize Partially Observable Markov Decisions Processes (POMDPs) deﬁned on continuous spaces. To date, most algorithms for model-based POMDPs are restricted to discrete states, actions, and observations, but many real-world problems such as, for instance, robot navigation, are naturally deﬁned on continuous spaces. In this work, we demonstrate that the value function for continuous POMDPs is convex in the beliefs over continuous state spaces, and piecewise-linear convex for the particular case of discrete observations and actions but still continuous states. We also demonstrate that continuous Bellman backups are contracting and isotonic ensuring the monotonic convergence of value-iteration algorithms. Relying on those properties, we extend the P ERSEUS algorithm, originally developed for discrete POMDPs, to work in continuous state spaces by representing the observation, transition, and reward models using Gaussian mixtures, and the beliefs using Gaussian mixtures or particle sets. With these representations, the integrals that appear in the Bellman backup can be computed in closed form and, therefore, the algorithm is computationally feasible. Finally, we further extend P ERSEUS to deal with continuous action and observation sets by designing effective sampling approaches.

<p>Author: Jelle R. Kok, Nikos Vlassis</p><p>Abstract: In this article we describe a set of scalable techniques for learning the behavior of a group of agents in a collaborative multiagent setting. As a basis we use the framework of coordination graphs of Guestrin, Koller, and Parr (2002a) which exploits the dependencies between agents to decompose the global payoff function into a sum of local terms. First, we deal with the single-state case and describe a payoff propagation algorithm that computes the individual actions that approximately maximize the global payoff function. The method can be viewed as the decision-making analogue of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Second, we focus on learning the behavior of the agents in sequential decision-making tasks. We introduce different model-free reinforcementlearning techniques, unitedly called Sparse Cooperative Q-learning, which approximate the global action-value function based on the topology of a coordination graph, and perform updates using the contribution of the individual agents to the maximal global action value. The combined use of an edge-based decomposition of the action-value function and the payoff propagation algorithm for efﬁcient action selection, result in an approach that scales only linearly in the problem size. We provide experimental evidence that our method outperforms related multiagent reinforcement-learning methods based on temporal differences.

<p>Author: Juho Rousu, Craig Saunders, Sandor Szedmak, John Shawe-Taylor</p><p>Abstract: We present a kernel-based algorithm for hierarchical text classiﬁcation where the documents are allowed to belong to more than one category at a time. The classiﬁcation model is a variant of the Maximum Margin Markov Network framework, where the classiﬁcation hierarchy is represented as a Markov tree equipped with an exponential family deﬁned on the edges. We present an efﬁcient optimization algorithm based on incremental conditional gradient ascent in single-example subspaces spanned by the marginal dual variables. The optimization is facilitated with a dynamic programming based algorithm that computes best update directions in the feasible set. Experiments show that the algorithm can feasibly optimize training sets of thousands of examples and classiﬁcation hierarchies consisting of hundreds of nodes. Training of the full hierarchical model is as efﬁcient as training independent SVM-light classiﬁers for each node. The algorithm’s predictive accuracy was found to be competitive with other recently introduced hierarchical multicategory or multilabel classiﬁcation learning algorithms.

<p>Author: Régis Vert, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We determine the asymptotic behaviour of the function computed by support vector machines (SVM) and related algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical convex loss function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian RBF kernel, in the situation where the number of examples tends to inﬁnity, the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel tends to 0, and the regularization parameter is held ﬁxed. Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the ﬁrst time to be a consistent density level set estimator.

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun</p><p>Abstract: The eigenvalues of the kernel matrix play an important role in a number of kernel methods, in particular, in kernel principal component analysis. It is well known that the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix converge as the number of samples tends to inﬁnity. We derive probabilistic ﬁnite sample size bounds on the approximation error of individual eigenvalues which have the important property that the bounds scale with the eigenvalue under consideration, reﬂecting the actual behavior of the approximation errors as predicted by asymptotic results and observed in numerical simulations. Such scaling bounds have so far only been known for tail sums of eigenvalues. Asymptotically, the bounds presented here have a slower than stochastic rate, but the number of sample points necessary to make this disadvantage noticeable is often unrealistically large. Therefore, under practical conditions, and for all but the largest few eigenvalues, the bounds presented here form a signiﬁcant improvement over existing non-scaling bounds.

<p>Author: Andrea Passerini, Paolo Frasconi, Luc De Raedt</p><p>Abstract: We develop kernels for measuring the similarity between relational instances using background knowledge expressed in ﬁrst-order logic. The method allows us to bridge the gap between traditional inductive logic programming (ILP) representations and statistical approaches to supervised learning. Logic programs are ﬁrst used to generate proofs of given visitor programs that use predicates declared in the available background knowledge. A kernel is then deﬁned over pairs of proof trees. The method can be used for supervised learning tasks and is suitable for classiﬁcation as well as regression. We report positive empirical results on Bongard-like and M-of-N problems that are difﬁcult or impossible to solve with traditional ILP techniques, as well as on real bioinformatics and chemoinformatics data sets.

<p>Author: Ross A. Lippert, Ryan M. Rifkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of Tikhonov regularization with a general convex loss function: this formalism includes support vector machines and regularized least squares. For a family of kernels that includes the Gaussian, parameterized by a “bandwidth” parameter σ, we characterize the limiting ˜ solution as σ → ∞. In particular, we show that if we set the regularization parameter λ = λσ−2p , the regularization term of the Tikhonov problem tends to an indicator function on polynomials of degree ⌊p⌋ (with residual regularization in the case where p ∈ Z). The proof rests on two key ideas: epi-convergence, a notion of functional convergence under which limits of minimizers converge to minimizers of limits, and a value-based formulation of learning, where we work with regularization on the function output values (y) as opposed to the function expansion coefﬁcients in the RKHS. Our result generalizes and uniﬁes previous results in this area.

<p>Author: Radu Stefan Niculescu, Tom M. Mitchell, R. Bharat Rao</p><p>Abstract: The task of learning models for many real-world problems requires incorporating domain knowledge into learning algorithms, to enable accurate learning from a realistic volume of training data. This paper considers a variety of types of domain knowledge for constraining parameter estimates when learning Bayesian networks. In particular, we consider domain knowledge that constrains the values or relationships among subsets of parameters in a Bayesian network with known structure. We incorporate a wide variety of parameter constraints into learning procedures for Bayesian networks, by formulating this task as a constrained optimization problem. The assumptions made in module networks, dynamic Bayes nets and context speciﬁc independence models can be viewed as particular cases of such parameter constraints. We present closed form solutions or fast iterative algorithms for estimating parameters subject to several speciﬁc classes of parameter constraints, including equalities and inequalities among parameters, constraints on individual parameters, and constraints on sums and ratios of parameters, for discrete and continuous variables. Our methods cover learning from both frequentist and Bayesian points of view, from both complete and incomplete data. We present formal guarantees for our estimators, as well as methods for automatically learning useful parameter constraints from data. To validate our approach, we apply it to the domain of fMRI brain image analysis. Here we demonstrate the ability of our system to ﬁrst learn useful relationships among parameters, and then to use them to constrain the training of the Bayesian network, resulting in improved cross-validated accuracy of the learned model. Experiments on synthetic data are also presented. Keywords: Bayesian networks, constrained optimization, domain knowledge c 2006 Radu Stefan Niculescu, Tom Mitchell and Bharat Rao.

<p>Author: Jing Zhou, Dean P. Foster, Robert A. Stine, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: In streamwise feature selection, new features are sequentially considered for addition to a predictive model. When the space of potential features is large, streamwise feature selection offers many advantages over traditional feature selection methods, which assume that all features are known in advance. Features can be generated dynamically, focusing the search for new features on promising subspaces, and overﬁtting can be controlled by dynamically adjusting the threshold for adding features to the model. In contrast to traditional forward feature selection algorithms such as stepwise regression in which at each step all possible features are evaluated and the best one is selected, streamwise feature selection only evaluates each feature once when it is generated. We describe information-investing and α-investing, two adaptive complexity penalty methods for streamwise feature selection which dynamically adjust the threshold on the error reduction required for adding a new feature. These two methods give false discovery rate style guarantees against overﬁtting. They differ from standard penalty methods such as AIC, BIC and RIC, which always drastically over- or under-ﬁt in the limit of inﬁnite numbers of non-predictive features. Empirical results show that streamwise regression is competitive with (on small data sets) and superior to (on large data sets) much more compute-intensive feature selection methods such as stepwise regression, and allows feature selection on problems with millions of potential features.

<p>Author: Hema Raghavan, Omid Madani, Rosie Jones</p><p>Abstract: We extend the traditional active learning framework to include feedback on features in addition to labeling instances, and we execute a careful study of the effects of feature selection and human feedback on features in the setting of text categorization. Our experiments on a variety of categorization tasks indicate that there is signiﬁcant potential in improving classiﬁer performance by feature re-weighting, beyond that achieved via membership queries alone (traditional active learning) if we have access to an oracle that can point to the important (most predictive) features. Our experiments on human subjects indicate that human feedback on feature relevance can identify a sufﬁcient proportion of the most relevant features (over 50% in our experiments). We ﬁnd that on average, labeling a feature takes much less time than labeling a document. We devise an algorithm that interleaves labeling features and documents which signiﬁcantly accelerates standard active learning in our simulation experiments. Feature feedback can complement traditional active learning in applications such as news ﬁltering, e-mail classiﬁcation, and personalization, where the human teacher can have signiﬁcant knowledge on the relevance of features.

<p>Author: Luis M. de Campos</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new scoring function for learning Bayesian networks from data using score+search algorithms. This is based on the concept of mutual information and exploits some well-known properties of this measure in a novel way. Essentially, a statistical independence test based on the chi-square distribution, associated with the mutual information measure, together with a property of additive decomposition of this measure, are combined in order to measure the degree of interaction between each variable and its parent variables in the network. The result is a non-Bayesian scoring function called MIT (mutual information tests) which belongs to the family of scores based on information theory. The MIT score also represents a penalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probability distributions associated with a candidate network and with the available data set. Detailed results of a complete experimental evaluation of the proposed scoring function and its comparison with the well-known K2, BDeu and BIC/MDL scores are also presented.

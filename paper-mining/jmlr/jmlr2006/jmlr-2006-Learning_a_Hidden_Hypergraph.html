<p>Author: Robert Castelo, Alberto Roverato</p><p>Abstract: Learning of large-scale networks of interactions from microarray data is an important and challenging problem in bioinformatics. A widely used approach is to assume that the available data constitute a random sample from a multivariate distribution belonging to a Gaussian graphical model. As a consequence, the prime objects of inference are full-order partial correlations which are partial correlations between two variables given the remaining ones. In the context of microarray data the number of variables exceed the sample size and this precludes the application of traditional structure learning procedures because a sampling version of full-order partial correlations does not exist. In this paper we consider limited-order partial correlations, these are partial correlations computed on marginal distributions of manageable size, and provide a set of rules that allow one to assess the usefulness of these quantities to derive the independence structure of the underlying Gaussian graphical model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel structure learning procedure based on a quantity, obtained from limited-order partial correlations, that we call the non-rejection rate. The applicability and usefulness of the procedure are demonstrated by both simulated and real data.

<p>Author: Ting Liu, Andrew W. Moore, Alexander Gray</p><p>Abstract: This paper is about non-approximate acceleration of high-dimensional nonparametric operations such as k nearest neighbor classiﬁers. We attempt to exploit the fact that even if we want exact answers to nonparametric queries, we usually do not need to explicitly ﬁnd the data points close to the query, but merely need to answer questions about the properties of that set of data points. This offers a small amount of computational leeway, and we investigate how much that leeway can be exploited. This is applicable to many algorithms in nonparametric statistics, memory-based learning and kernel-based learning. But for clarity, this paper concentrates on pure k-NN classiﬁcation. We introduce new ball-tree algorithms that on real-world data sets give accelerations from 2-fold to 100-fold compared against highly optimized traditional ball-tree-based k-NN . These results include data sets with up to 106 dimensions and 105 records, and demonstrate non-trivial speed-ups while giving exact answers. keywords: ball-tree, k-NN classiﬁcation</p><p>5 0.053701859 <a title="53-tfidf-5" href="./jmlr-2006-Toward_Attribute_Efficient_Learning_of_Decision_Lists_and_Parities.html">92 jmlr-2006-Toward Attribute Efficient Learning of Decision Lists and Parities</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam R. Klivans, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We consider two well-studied problems regarding attribute efﬁcient learning: learning decision lists and learning parity functions. First, we give an algorithm for learning decision lists of length ˜ 1/3 ˜ 1/3 k over n variables using 2O(k ) log n examples and time nO(k ) . This is the ﬁrst algorithm for learning decision lists that has both subexponential sample complexity and subexponential running time in the relevant parameters. Our approach establishes a relationship between attribute efﬁcient learning and polynomial threshold functions and is based on a new construction of low degree, low weight polynomial threshold functions for decision lists. For a wide range of parameters our construction matches a lower bound due to Beigel for decision lists and gives an essentially optimal tradeoff between polynomial threshold function degree and weight. Second, we give an algorithm for learning an unknown parity function on k out of n variables using O(n1−1/k ) examples in poly(n) time. For k = o(log n) this yields a polynomial time algorithm with sample complexity o(n); this is the ﬁrst polynomial time algorithm for learning parity on a superconstant number of variables with sublinear sample complexity. We also give a simple algorithm for learning an unknown length-k parity using O(k log n) examples in nk/2 time, which improves on the naive nk time bound of exhaustive search.

<p>Author: Hema Raghavan, Omid Madani, Rosie Jones</p><p>Abstract: We extend the traditional active learning framework to include feedback on features in addition to labeling instances, and we execute a careful study of the effects of feature selection and human feedback on features in the setting of text categorization. Our experiments on a variety of categorization tasks indicate that there is signiﬁcant potential in improving classiﬁer performance by feature re-weighting, beyond that achieved via membership queries alone (traditional active learning) if we have access to an oracle that can point to the important (most predictive) features. Our experiments on human subjects indicate that human feedback on feature relevance can identify a sufﬁcient proportion of the most relevant features (over 50% in our experiments). We ﬁnd that on average, labeling a feature takes much less time than labeling a document. We devise an algorithm that interleaves labeling features and documents which signiﬁcantly accelerates standard active learning in our simulation experiments. Feature feedback can complement traditional active learning in applications such as news ﬁltering, e-mail classiﬁcation, and personalization, where the human teacher can have signiﬁcant knowledge on the relevance of features.

<p>Author: Dana Angluin, Jiang Chen</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a hypergraph using edge-detecting queries. In this model, the learner may query whether a set of vertices induces an edge of the hidden hypergraph or not. We show that an r-uniform hypergraph with m edges and n vertices is learnable with O(2 4r m · poly(r, log n)) queries with high probability. The queries can be made in O(min(2 r (log m + r)2 , (log m + r)3 )) rounds. We also give an algorithm that learns an almost uniform hypergraph of ∆ ∆ dimension r using O(2O((1+ 2 )r) · m1+ 2 · poly(log n)) queries with high probability, where ∆ is the difference between the maximum and the minimum edge sizes. This upper bound matches our ∆ lower bound of Ω(( m∆ )1+ 2 ) for this class of hypergraphs in terms of dependence on m. The 1+ 2 queries can also be made in O((1 + ∆) · min(2r (log m + r)2 , (log m + r)3 )) rounds.

<p>Author: Shalabh Bhatnagar, Vivek S. Borkar, Madhukar Akarapu</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of long-run average cost control of Markov chains conditioned on a rare event. In a related recent work, a simulation based algorithm for estimating performance measures associated with a Markov chain conditioned on a rare event has been developed. We extend ideas from this work and develop an adaptive algorithm for obtaining, online, optimal control policies conditioned on a rare event. Our algorithm uses three timescales or step-size schedules. On the slowest timescale, a gradient search algorithm for policy updates that is based on one-simulation simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) type estimates is used. Deterministic perturbation sequences obtained from appropriate normalized Hadamard matrices are used here. The fast timescale recursions compute the conditional transition probabilities of an associated chain by obtaining solutions to the multiplicative Poisson equation (for a given policy estimate). Further, the risk parameter associated with the value function for a given policy estimate is updated on a timescale that lies in between the two scales above. We brieﬂy sketch the convergence analysis of our algorithm and present a numerical application in the setting of routing multiple ﬂows in communication networks.

<p>Author: S. V. N. Vishwanathan, Nicol N. Schraudolph, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an online support vector machine (SVM) that uses the stochastic meta-descent (SMD) algorithm to adapt its step size automatically. We formulate the online learning problem as a stochastic gradient descent in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and translate SMD to the nonparametric setting, where its gradient trace parameter is no longer a coefﬁcient vector but an element of the RKHS. We derive efﬁcient updates that allow us to perform the step size adaptation in linear time. We apply the online SVM framework to a variety of loss functions, and in particular show how to handle structured output spaces and achieve efﬁcient online multiclass classiﬁcation. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms more primitive methods for setting the gradient step size.

<p>Author: Adam R. Klivans, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We consider two well-studied problems regarding attribute efﬁcient learning: learning decision lists and learning parity functions. First, we give an algorithm for learning decision lists of length ˜ 1/3 ˜ 1/3 k over n variables using 2O(k ) log n examples and time nO(k ) . This is the ﬁrst algorithm for learning decision lists that has both subexponential sample complexity and subexponential running time in the relevant parameters. Our approach establishes a relationship between attribute efﬁcient learning and polynomial threshold functions and is based on a new construction of low degree, low weight polynomial threshold functions for decision lists. For a wide range of parameters our construction matches a lower bound due to Beigel for decision lists and gives an essentially optimal tradeoff between polynomial threshold function degree and weight. Second, we give an algorithm for learning an unknown parity function on k out of n variables using O(n1−1/k ) examples in poly(n) time. For k = o(log n) this yields a polynomial time algorithm with sample complexity o(n); this is the ﬁrst polynomial time algorithm for learning parity on a superconstant number of variables with sublinear sample complexity. We also give a simple algorithm for learning an unknown length-k parity using O(k log n) examples in nk/2 time, which improves on the naive nk time bound of exhaustive search.

<p>Author: Hichem Sahbi, Donald Geman</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a computational design for pattern detection based on a tree-structured network of support vector machines (SVMs). An SVM is associated with each cell in a recursive partitioning of the space of patterns (hypotheses) into increasingly ﬁner subsets. The hierarchy is traversed coarse-to-ﬁne and each chain of positive responses from the root to a leaf constitutes a detection. Our objective is to design and build a network which balances overall error and computation. Initially, SVMs are constructed for each cell with no constraints. This “free network” is then perturbed, cell by cell, into another network, which is “graded” in two ways: ﬁrst, the number of support vectors of each SVM is reduced (by clustering) in order to adjust to a pre-determined, increasing function of cell depth; second, the decision boundaries are shifted to preserve all positive responses from the original set of training data. The limits on the numbers of clusters (virtual support vectors) result from minimizing the mean computational cost of collecting all detections subject to a bound on the expected number of false positives. When applied to detecting faces in cluttered scenes, the patterns correspond to poses and the free network is already faster and more accurate than applying a single pose-speciﬁc SVM many times. The graded network promotes very rapid processing of background regions while maintaining the discriminatory power of the free network.

<p>Author: Peter Bühlmann, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: We propose Sparse Boosting (the SparseL2 Boost algorithm), a variant on boosting with the squared error loss. SparseL2 Boost yields sparser solutions than the previously proposed L2 Boosting by minimizing some penalized L2 -loss functions, the FPE model selection criteria, through smallstep gradient descent. Although boosting may give already relatively sparse solutions, for example corresponding to the soft-thresholding estimator in orthogonal linear models, there is sometimes a desire for more sparseness to increase prediction accuracy and ability for better variable selection: such goals can be achieved with SparseL2 Boost. We prove an equivalence of SparseL2 Boost to Breiman’s nonnegative garrote estimator for orthogonal linear models and demonstrate the generic nature of SparseL2 Boost for nonparametric interaction modeling. For an automatic selection of the tuning parameter in SparseL2 Boost we propose to employ the gMDL model selection criterion which can also be used for early stopping of L2 Boosting. Consequently, we can select between SparseL2 Boost and L2 Boosting by comparing their gMDL scores.

<p>Author: Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We study a variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo estimation of functionals in Markov chains. The method is based on designing sequential control variates using successive approximations of the function of interest V . Regular Monte Carlo estimates have a variance of O(1/N), where N is the number of sample trajectories of the Markov chain. Here, we obtain a geometric variance reduction O(ρN ) (with ρ < 1) up to a threshold that depends on the approximation error V − A V , where A is an approximation operator linear in the values. Thus, if V belongs to the right approximation space (i.e. A V = V ), the variance decreases geometrically to zero. An immediate application is value function estimation in Markov chains, which may be used for policy evaluation in a policy iteration algorithm for solving Markov Decision Processes. Another important domain, for which variance reduction is highly needed, is gradient estimation, that is computing the sensitivity ∂αV of the performance measure V with respect to some parameter α of the transition probabilities. For example, in policy parametric optimization, computing an estimate of the policy gradient is required to perform a gradient optimization method. We show that, using two approximations for the value function and the gradient, a geometric variance reduction is also achieved, up to a threshold that depends on the approximation errors of both of those representations.</p><p>4 0.038560241 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2006-Pattern_Recognition_for__Conditionally_Independent_Data.html">73 jmlr-2006-Pattern Recognition for  Conditionally Independent Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: In this work we consider the task of relaxing the i.i.d. assumption in pattern recognition (or classiﬁcation), aiming to make existing learning algorithms applicable to a wider range of tasks. Pattern recognition is guessing a discrete label of some object based on a set of given examples (pairs of objects and labels). We consider the case of deterministically deﬁned labels. Traditionally, this task is studied under the assumption that examples are independent and identically distributed. However, it turns out that many results of pattern recognition theory carry over a weaker assumption. Namely, under the assumption of conditional independence and identical distribution of objects, while the only assumption on the distribution of labels is that the rate of occurrence of each label should be above some positive threshold. We ﬁnd a broad class of learning algorithms for which estimations of the probability of the classiﬁcation error achieved under the classical i.i.d. assumption can be generalized to the similar estimates for case of conditionally i.i.d. examples.</p><p>5 0.030789375 <a title="66-tfidf-5" href="./jmlr-2006-Accurate_Error_Bounds_for_the_Eigenvalues_of_the_Kernel_Matrix.html">9 jmlr-2006-Accurate Error Bounds for the Eigenvalues of the Kernel Matrix</a></p>
<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun</p><p>Abstract: The eigenvalues of the kernel matrix play an important role in a number of kernel methods, in particular, in kernel principal component analysis. It is well known that the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix converge as the number of samples tends to inﬁnity. We derive probabilistic ﬁnite sample size bounds on the approximation error of individual eigenvalues which have the important property that the bounds scale with the eigenvalue under consideration, reﬂecting the actual behavior of the approximation errors as predicted by asymptotic results and observed in numerical simulations. Such scaling bounds have so far only been known for tail sums of eigenvalues. Asymptotically, the bounds presented here have a slower than stochastic rate, but the number of sample points necessary to make this disadvantage noticeable is often unrealistically large. Therefore, under practical conditions, and for all but the largest few eigenvalues, the bounds presented here form a signiﬁcant improvement over existing non-scaling bounds.

<p>Author: Ron Begleiter, Ran El-Yaniv</p><p>Abstract: We present worst case bounds for the learning rate of a known prediction method that is based on hierarchical applications of binary context tree weighting (CTW) predictors. A heuristic application of this approach that relies on Huffman’s alphabet decomposition is known to achieve state-ofthe-art performance in prediction and lossless compression benchmarks. We show that our new bound for this heuristic is tighter than the best known performance guarantees for prediction and lossless compression algorithms in various settings. This result substantiates the efﬁciency of this hierarchical method and provides a compelling explanation for its practical success. In addition, we present the results of a few experiments that examine other possibilities for improving the multialphabet prediction performance of CTW-based algorithms.

<p>Author: Peng Zhao, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity or parsimony of statistical models is crucial for their proper interpretations, as in sciences and social sciences. Model selection is a commonly used method to ﬁnd such models, but usually involves a computationally heavy combinatorial search. Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) is now being used as a computationally feasible alternative to model selection. Therefore it is important to study Lasso for model selection purposes. In this paper, we prove that a single condition, which we call the Irrepresentable Condition, is almost necessary and sufﬁcient for Lasso to select the true model both in the classical ﬁxed p setting and in the large p setting as the sample size n gets large. Based on these results, sufﬁcient conditions that are veriﬁable in practice are given to relate to previous works and help applications of Lasso for feature selection and sparse representation. This Irrepresentable Condition, which depends mainly on the covariance of the predictor variables, states that Lasso selects the true model consistently if and (almost) only if the predictors that are not in the true model are “irrepresentable” (in a sense to be clariﬁed) by predictors that are in the true model. Furthermore, simulations are carried out to provide insights and understanding of this result.

<p>Author: Clayton D. Scott, Robert D. Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Given a probability measure P and a reference measure µ, one is often interested in the minimum µ-measure set with P-measure at least α. Minimum volume sets of this type summarize the regions of greatest probability mass of P, and are useful for detecting anomalies and constructing conﬁdence regions. This paper addresses the problem of estimating minimum volume sets based on independent samples distributed according to P. Other than these samples, no other information is available regarding P, but the reference measure µ is assumed to be known. We introduce rules for estimating minimum volume sets that parallel the empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization principles in classiﬁcation. As in classiﬁcation, we show that the performances of our estimators are controlled by the rate of uniform convergence of empirical to true probabilities over the class from which the estimator is drawn. Thus we obtain ﬁnite sample size performance bounds in terms of VC dimension and related quantities. We also demonstrate strong universal consistency, an oracle inequality, and rates of convergence. The proposed estimators are illustrated with histogram and decision tree set estimation rules.

<p>Author: Régis Vert, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We determine the asymptotic behaviour of the function computed by support vector machines (SVM) and related algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical convex loss function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian RBF kernel, in the situation where the number of examples tends to inﬁnity, the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel tends to 0, and the regularization parameter is held ﬁxed. Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the ﬁrst time to be a consistent density level set estimator.

<p>Author: Dana Angluin, Jiang Chen</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a hypergraph using edge-detecting queries. In this model, the learner may query whether a set of vertices induces an edge of the hidden hypergraph or not. We show that an r-uniform hypergraph with m edges and n vertices is learnable with O(2 4r m · poly(r, log n)) queries with high probability. The queries can be made in O(min(2 r (log m + r)2 , (log m + r)3 )) rounds. We also give an algorithm that learns an almost uniform hypergraph of ∆ ∆ dimension r using O(2O((1+ 2 )r) · m1+ 2 · poly(log n)) queries with high probability, where ∆ is the difference between the maximum and the minimum edge sizes. This upper bound matches our ∆ lower bound of Ω(( m∆ )1+ 2 ) for this class of hypergraphs in terms of dependence on m. The 1+ 2 queries can also be made in O((1 + ∆) · min(2r (log m + r)2 , (log m + r)3 )) rounds.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: In this work we consider the task of relaxing the i.i.d. assumption in pattern recognition (or classiﬁcation), aiming to make existing learning algorithms applicable to a wider range of tasks. Pattern recognition is guessing a discrete label of some object based on a set of given examples (pairs of objects and labels). We consider the case of deterministically deﬁned labels. Traditionally, this task is studied under the assumption that examples are independent and identically distributed. However, it turns out that many results of pattern recognition theory carry over a weaker assumption. Namely, under the assumption of conditional independence and identical distribution of objects, while the only assumption on the distribution of labels is that the rate of occurrence of each label should be above some positive threshold. We ﬁnd a broad class of learning algorithms for which estimations of the probability of the classiﬁcation error achieved under the classical i.i.d. assumption can be generalized to the similar estimates for case of conditionally i.i.d. examples.</p><p>6 0.34300882 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2006-Efficient_Learning_of_Label_Ranking_by_Soft_Projections_onto_Polyhedra_%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%28Special_Topic_on_Machine_Learning_and_Optimization%29.html">26 jmlr-2006-Efficient Learning of Label Ranking by Soft Projections onto Polyhedra     (Special Topic on Machine Learning and Optimization)</a></p>

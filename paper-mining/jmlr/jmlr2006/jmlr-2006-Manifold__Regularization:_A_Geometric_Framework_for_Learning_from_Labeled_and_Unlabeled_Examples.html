<p>Author: Ross A. Lippert, Ryan M. Rifkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of Tikhonov regularization with a general convex loss function: this formalism includes support vector machines and regularized least squares. For a family of kernels that includes the Gaussian, parameterized by a “bandwidth” parameter σ, we characterize the limiting ˜ solution as σ → ∞. In particular, we show that if we set the regularization parameter λ = λσ−2p , the regularization term of the Tikhonov problem tends to an indicator function on polynomials of degree ⌊p⌋ (with residual regularization in the case where p ∈ Z). The proof rests on two key ideas: epi-convergence, a notion of functional convergence under which limits of minimizers converge to minimizers of limits, and a value-based formulation of learning, where we work with regularization on the function output values (y) as opposed to the function expansion coefﬁcients in the RKHS. Our result generalizes and uniﬁes previous results in this area.

<p>Author: Sayan Mukherjee, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that learns gradients from samples in the supervised learning framework. An error analysis is given for the convergence of the gradient estimated by the algorithm to the true gradient. The utility of the algorithm for the problem of variable selection as well as determining variable covariance is illustrated on simulated data as well as two gene expression data sets. For square loss we provide a very efﬁcient implementation with respect to both memory and time.

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Luca Zaniboni</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of classifying data in a given taxonomy when classiﬁcations associated with multiple and/or partial paths are allowed. We introduce a new algorithm that incrementally learns a linear-threshold classiﬁer for each node of the taxonomy. A hierarchical classiﬁcation is obtained by evaluating the trained node classiﬁers in a top-down fashion. To evaluate classiﬁers in our multipath framework, we deﬁne a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, capturing the intuition that whenever a classiﬁcation mistake is made on a node of the taxonomy, then no loss should be charged for any additional mistake occurring in the subtree of that node. Making no assumptions on the mechanism generating the data instances, and assuming a linear noise model for the labels, we bound the H-loss of our on-line algorithm in terms of the H-loss of a reference classiﬁer knowing the true parameters of the label-generating process. We show that, in expectation, the excess cumulative H-loss grows at most logarithmically in the length of the data sequence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the precise dependence of the rate of convergence on the eigenstructure of the data each node observes. Our theoretical results are complemented by a number of experiments on texual corpora. In these experiments we show that, after only one epoch of training, our algorithm performs much better than Perceptron-based hierarchical classiﬁers, and reasonably close to a hierarchical support vector machine.

<p>Author: S. Sathiya Keerthi, Olivier Chapelle, Dennis DeCoste</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs), though accurate, are not preferred in applications requiring great classiﬁcation speed, due to the number of support vectors being large. To overcome this problem we devise a primal method with the following properties: (1) it decouples the idea of basis functions from the concept of support vectors; (2) it greedily ﬁnds a set of kernel basis functions of a speciﬁed maximum size (dmax ) to approximate the SVM primal cost function well; (3) it is 2 efﬁcient and roughly scales as O(ndmax ) where n is the number of training examples; and, (4) the number of basis functions it requires to achieve an accuracy close to the SVM accuracy is usually far less than the number of SVM support vectors.

<p>Author: Juho Rousu, Craig Saunders, Sandor Szedmak, John Shawe-Taylor</p><p>Abstract: We present a kernel-based algorithm for hierarchical text classiﬁcation where the documents are allowed to belong to more than one category at a time. The classiﬁcation model is a variant of the Maximum Margin Markov Network framework, where the classiﬁcation hierarchy is represented as a Markov tree equipped with an exponential family deﬁned on the edges. We present an efﬁcient optimization algorithm based on incremental conditional gradient ascent in single-example subspaces spanned by the marginal dual variables. The optimization is facilitated with a dynamic programming based algorithm that computes best update directions in the feasible set. Experiments show that the algorithm can feasibly optimize training sets of thousands of examples and classiﬁcation hierarchies consisting of hundreds of nodes. Training of the full hierarchical model is as efﬁcient as training independent SVM-light classiﬁers for each node. The algorithm’s predictive accuracy was found to be competitive with other recently introduced hierarchical multicategory or multilabel classiﬁcation learning algorithms.

<p>Author: Mikhail Belkin, Partha Niyogi, Vikas Sindhwani</p><p>Abstract: We propose a family of learning algorithms based on a new form of regularization that allows us to exploit the geometry of the marginal distribution. We focus on a semi-supervised framework that incorporates labeled and unlabeled data in a general-purpose learner. Some transductive graph learning algorithms and standard methods including support vector machines and regularized least squares can be obtained as special cases. We use properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to prove new Representer theorems that provide theoretical basis for the algorithms. As a result (in contrast to purely graph-based approaches) we obtain a natural out-of-sample extension to novel examples and so are able to handle both transductive and truly semi-supervised settings. We present experimental evidence suggesting that our semi-supervised algorithms are able to use unlabeled data effectively. Finally we have a brief discussion of unsupervised and fully supervised learning within our general framework.

<p>Author: Sayan Mukherjee, Qiang Wu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that simultaneously estimates a classiﬁcation function as well as its gradient in the supervised learning framework. The motivation for the algorithm is to ﬁnd salient variables and estimate how they covary. An efﬁcient implementation with respect to both memory and time is given. The utility of the algorithm is illustrated on simulated data as well as a gene expression data set. An error analysis is given for the convergence of the estimate of the classiﬁcation function and its gradient to the true classiﬁcation function and true gradient.

<p>Author: Sayan Mukherjee, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that learns gradients from samples in the supervised learning framework. An error analysis is given for the convergence of the gradient estimated by the algorithm to the true gradient. The utility of the algorithm for the problem of variable selection as well as determining variable covariance is illustrated on simulated data as well as two gene expression data sets. For square loss we provide a very efﬁcient implementation with respect to both memory and time.

<p>Author: Régis Vert, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We determine the asymptotic behaviour of the function computed by support vector machines (SVM) and related algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical convex loss function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian RBF kernel, in the situation where the number of examples tends to inﬁnity, the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel tends to 0, and the regularization parameter is held ﬁxed. Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the ﬁrst time to be a consistent density level set estimator.

<p>Author: Clayton D. Scott, Robert D. Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Given a probability measure P and a reference measure µ, one is often interested in the minimum µ-measure set with P-measure at least α. Minimum volume sets of this type summarize the regions of greatest probability mass of P, and are useful for detecting anomalies and constructing conﬁdence regions. This paper addresses the problem of estimating minimum volume sets based on independent samples distributed according to P. Other than these samples, no other information is available regarding P, but the reference measure µ is assumed to be known. We introduce rules for estimating minimum volume sets that parallel the empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization principles in classiﬁcation. As in classiﬁcation, we show that the performances of our estimators are controlled by the rate of uniform convergence of empirical to true probabilities over the class from which the estimator is drawn. Thus we obtain ﬁnite sample size performance bounds in terms of VC dimension and related quantities. We also demonstrate strong universal consistency, an oracle inequality, and rates of convergence. The proposed estimators are illustrated with histogram and decision tree set estimation rules.

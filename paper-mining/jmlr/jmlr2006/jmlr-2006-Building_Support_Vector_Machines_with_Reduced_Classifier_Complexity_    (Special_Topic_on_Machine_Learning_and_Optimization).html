This work focuses on the design and analysis of efﬁcient incremental SVM learning, with the aim of providing a fast, numerically stable and robust implementation. A detailed analysis of convergence and of algorithmic complexity of incremental SVM learning is carried out. Based on this analysis, a new design of storage and numerical operations is proposed, which speeds up the training of an incremental SVM by a factor of 5 to 20.

<p>Author: Katya Scheinberg</p><p>Abstract: We propose an active set algorithm to solve the convex quadratic programming (QP) problem which is the core of the support vector machine (SVM) training. The underlying method is not new and is based on the extensive practice of the Simplex method and its variants for convex quadratic problems. However, its application to large-scale SVM problems is new. Until recently the traditional active set methods were considered impractical for large SVM problems. By adapting the methods to the special structure of SVM problems we were able to produce an efﬁcient implementation. We conduct an extensive study of the behavior of our method and its variations on SVM problems. We present computational results comparing our method with Joachims’ SVM light (see Joachims, 1999). The results show that our method has overall better performance on many SVM problems. It seems to have a particularly strong advantage on more difﬁcult problems. In addition this algorithm has better theoretical properties and it naturally extends to the incremental mode. Since the proposed method solves the standard SVM formulation, as does SVMlight , the generalization properties of these two approaches are identical and we do not discuss them in the paper.

<p>Author: Sören Sonnenburg, Gunnar Rätsch, Christin Schäfer, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: While classical kernel-based learning algorithms are based on a single kernel, in practice it is often desirable to use multiple kernels. Lanckriet et al. (2004) considered conic combinations of kernel matrices for classiﬁcation, leading to a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. We show that it can be rewritten as a semi-inﬁnite linear program that can be efﬁciently solved by recycling the standard SVM implementations. Moreover, we generalize the formulation and our method to a larger class of problems, including regression and one-class classiﬁcation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm works for hundred thousands of examples or hundreds of kernels to be combined, and helps for automatic model selection, improving the interpretability of the learning result. In a second part we discuss general speed up mechanism for SVMs, especially when used with sparse feature maps as appear for string kernels, allowing us to train a string kernel SVM on a 10 million real-world splice data set from computational biology. We integrated multiple kernel learning in our machine learning toolbox SHOGUN for which the source code is publicly available at http://www.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/raetsch/projects/shogun.

The software implements an iterative decomposition technique and exploits both the storage and the computing resources available on multiprocessor systems, by distributing the heaviest computational tasks of each decomposition iteration. Based on a wide range of recent theoretical advances, relevant decomposition issues, such as the quadratic subproblem solution, the gradient updating, the working set selection, are systematically described and their careful combination to get an effective parallel tool is discussed. A comparison with state-ofthe-art packages on benchmark problems demonstrates the good accuracy and the remarkable time saving achieved by the proposed software. Furthermore, challenging experiments on real-world data sets with millions training samples highlight how the software makes large scale standard nonlinear support vector machines effectively tractable on common multiprocessor systems.

<p>Author: Mingrui Wu, Bernhard Schölkopf, Gökhan Bakır</p><p>Abstract: Many kernel learning algorithms, including support vector machines, result in a kernel machine, such as a kernel classiﬁer, whose key component is a weight vector in a feature space implicitly introduced by a positive deﬁnite kernel function. This weight vector is usually obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Based on this fact we present a direct method to build sparse kernel learning algorithms by adding one more constraint to the original convex optimization problem, such that the sparseness of the resulting kernel machine is explicitly controlled while at the same time performance is kept as high as possible. A gradient based approach is provided to solve this modiﬁed optimization problem. Applying this method to the support vectom machine results in a concrete algorithm for building sparse large margin classiﬁers. These classiﬁers essentially ﬁnd a discriminating subspace that can be spanned by a small number of vectors, and in this subspace, the diﬀerent classes of data are linearly well separated. Experimental results over several classiﬁcation benchmarks demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our approach.

<p>Author: Jieping Ye, Tao Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is an important pre-processing step in many applications. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical statistical approach for supervised dimensionality reduction. It aims to maximize the ratio of the between-class distance to the within-class distance, thus maximizing the class discrimination. It has been used widely in many applications. However, the classical LDA formulation requires the nonsingularity of the scatter matrices involved. For undersampled problems, where the data dimensionality is much larger than the sample size, all scatter matrices are singular and classical LDA fails. Many extensions, including null space LDA (NLDA) and orthogonal LDA (OLDA), have been proposed in the past to overcome this problem. NLDA aims to maximize the between-class distance in the null space of the within-class scatter matrix, while OLDA computes a set of orthogonal discriminant vectors via the simultaneous diagonalization of the scatter matrices. They have been applied successfully in various applications. In this paper, we present a computational and theoretical analysis of NLDA and OLDA. Our main result shows that under a mild condition which holds in many applications involving highdimensional data, NLDA is equivalent to OLDA. We have performed extensive experiments on various types of data and results are consistent with our theoretical analysis. We further apply the regularization to OLDA. The algorithm is called regularized OLDA (or ROLDA for short). An efﬁcient algorithm is presented to estimate the regularization value in ROLDA. A comparative study on classiﬁcation shows that ROLDA is very competitive with OLDA. This conﬁrms the effectiveness of the regularization in ROLDA.

<p>Author: S. Sathiya Keerthi, Olivier Chapelle, Dennis DeCoste</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs), though accurate, are not preferred in applications requiring great classiﬁcation speed, due to the number of support vectors being large. To overcome this problem we devise a primal method with the following properties: (1) it decouples the idea of basis functions from the concept of support vectors; (2) it greedily ﬁnds a set of kernel basis functions of a speciﬁed maximum size (dmax ) to approximate the SVM primal cost function well; (3) it is 2 efﬁcient and roughly scales as O(ndmax ) where n is the number of training examples; and, (4) the number of basis functions it requires to achieve an accuracy close to the SVM accuracy is usually far less than the number of SVM support vectors.

<p>Author: Katya Scheinberg</p><p>Abstract: We propose an active set algorithm to solve the convex quadratic programming (QP) problem which is the core of the support vector machine (SVM) training. The underlying method is not new and is based on the extensive practice of the Simplex method and its variants for convex quadratic problems. However, its application to large-scale SVM problems is new. Until recently the traditional active set methods were considered impractical for large SVM problems. By adapting the methods to the special structure of SVM problems we were able to produce an efﬁcient implementation. We conduct an extensive study of the behavior of our method and its variations on SVM problems. We present computational results comparing our method with Joachims’ SVM light (see Joachims, 1999). The results show that our method has overall better performance on many SVM problems. It seems to have a particularly strong advantage on more difﬁcult problems. In addition this algorithm has better theoretical properties and it naturally extends to the incremental mode. Since the proposed method solves the standard SVM formulation, as does SVMlight , the generalization properties of these two approaches are identical and we do not discuss them in the paper.

<p>Author: Sören Sonnenburg, Gunnar Rätsch, Christin Schäfer, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: While classical kernel-based learning algorithms are based on a single kernel, in practice it is often desirable to use multiple kernels. Lanckriet et al. (2004) considered conic combinations of kernel matrices for classiﬁcation, leading to a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. We show that it can be rewritten as a semi-inﬁnite linear program that can be efﬁciently solved by recycling the standard SVM implementations. Moreover, we generalize the formulation and our method to a larger class of problems, including regression and one-class classiﬁcation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm works for hundred thousands of examples or hundreds of kernels to be combined, and helps for automatic model selection, improving the interpretability of the learning result. In a second part we discuss general speed up mechanism for SVMs, especially when used with sparse feature maps as appear for string kernels, allowing us to train a string kernel SVM on a 10 million real-world splice data set from computational biology. We integrated multiple kernel learning in our machine learning toolbox SHOGUN for which the source code is publicly available at http://www.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/raetsch/projects/shogun.

<p>Author: S. V. N. Vishwanathan, Nicol N. Schraudolph, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an online support vector machine (SVM) that uses the stochastic meta-descent (SMD) algorithm to adapt its step size automatically. We formulate the online learning problem as a stochastic gradient descent in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and translate SMD to the nonparametric setting, where its gradient trace parameter is no longer a coefﬁcient vector but an element of the RKHS. We derive efﬁcient updates that allow us to perform the step size adaptation in linear time. We apply the online SVM framework to a variety of loss functions, and in particular show how to handle structured output spaces and achieve efﬁcient online multiclass classiﬁcation. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms more primitive methods for setting the gradient step size.

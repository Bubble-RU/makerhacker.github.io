<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun</p><p>Abstract: The eigenvalues of the kernel matrix play an important role in a number of kernel methods, in particular, in kernel principal component analysis. It is well known that the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix converge as the number of samples tends to inﬁnity. We derive probabilistic ﬁnite sample size bounds on the approximation error of individual eigenvalues which have the important property that the bounds scale with the eigenvalue under consideration, reﬂecting the actual behavior of the approximation errors as predicted by asymptotic results and observed in numerical simulations. Such scaling bounds have so far only been known for tail sums of eigenvalues. Asymptotically, the bounds presented here have a slower than stochastic rate, but the number of sample points necessary to make this disadvantage noticeable is often unrealistically large. Therefore, under practical conditions, and for all but the largest few eigenvalues, the bounds presented here form a signiﬁcant improvement over existing non-scaling bounds.

<p>Author: Ting Liu, Andrew W. Moore, Alexander Gray</p><p>Abstract: This paper is about non-approximate acceleration of high-dimensional nonparametric operations such as k nearest neighbor classiﬁers. We attempt to exploit the fact that even if we want exact answers to nonparametric queries, we usually do not need to explicitly ﬁnd the data points close to the query, but merely need to answer questions about the properties of that set of data points. This offers a small amount of computational leeway, and we investigate how much that leeway can be exploited. This is applicable to many algorithms in nonparametric statistics, memory-based learning and kernel-based learning. But for clarity, this paper concentrates on pure k-NN classiﬁcation. We introduce new ball-tree algorithms that on real-world data sets give accelerations from 2-fold to 100-fold compared against highly optimized traditional ball-tree-based k-NN . These results include data sets with up to 106 dimensions and 105 records, and demonstrate non-trivial speed-ups while giving exact answers. keywords: ball-tree, k-NN classiﬁcation</p><p>4 0.038284492 <a title="13-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2006-On_Representing_and_Generating_Kernels_by_Fuzzy_Equivalence_Relations.html">67 jmlr-2006-On Representing and Generating Kernels by Fuzzy Equivalence Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernhard Moser</p><p>Abstract: Kernels are two-placed functions that can be interpreted as inner products in some Hilbert space. It is this property which makes kernels predestinated to carry linear models of learning, optimization or classiﬁcation strategies over to non-linear variants. Following this idea, various kernel-based methods like support vector machines or kernel principal component analysis have been conceived which prove to be successful for machine learning, data mining and computer vision applications. When applying a kernel-based method a central question is the choice and the design of the kernel function. This paper provides a novel view on kernels based on fuzzy-logical concepts which allows to incorporate prior knowledge in the design process. It is demonstrated that kernels mapping to the unit interval with constant one in its diagonal can be represented by a commonly used fuzzylogical formula for representing fuzzy rule bases. This means that a great class of kernels can be represented by fuzzy-logical concepts. Apart from this result, which only guarantees the existence of such a representation, constructive examples are presented and the relation to unlabeled learning is pointed out. Keywords: kernel, triangular norm, T -transitivity, fuzzy relation, residuum 1. Motivation Positive-deﬁniteness plays a prominent role especially in optimization and machine learning due to the fact that two-place functions with this property, so-called kernels, can be represented as inner products in some Hilbert space. Thereby, optimization techniques conceived on the basis of linear models can be extended to non-linear algorithms. For a survey of applications see, for example, ¨ Jolliffe (1986), Sch¨ lkopf and Smola (2002) and Scholkopf et al. (1998). o Recently in Moser (2006) it was shown that kernels with values from the unit interval can be interpreted as fuzzy equivalence relations motivated by the idea that kernels express a kind of similarity. This means that the concept of fuzzy equivalence relations, or synonymously fuzzy similarity relations, is more general than that of kernels, provided only values in the unit interval are considered. Fuzzy equivalence relations distinguish from Boolean equivalence relations by a many-valued extension of transitivity which can be interpreted as many-valued logical model of the statement “IF x is similar to y AND y is similar to z THEN x is similar to z”. In contrast to the Boolean case, in many-valued logics the set of truth values is extended such that also assertions, for example, whether two elements x and y are similar, can be treated as a matter of degree. The standard model for the set of (quasi) truth values of fuzzy logic and other many-valued logical systems is the unit interval. If E(x, y) represents the (quasi) truth value of the statement that x is c 2006 Bernhard Moser. M OSER similar to y, then the many-valued version of transitivity is modeled by T (E(x, y), E(y, z)) ≤ E(x, z) where T is a so-called triangular norm which is an extension of the Boolean conjunction. This many-valued concept for transitivity is called T -transitivity. For a survey on triangular norms see, for example, Dubois and Prade (1985), Gottwald (1986), Gottwald (1993) and Klement et al. (2000), ¨ and for fuzzy equivalence relations and T -transitivity see, for example, Bodenhofer (2003), H ohle (1993), H¨ hle (1999), Klement et al. (2000), and Zadeh (1971). o Based on the semantics of fuzzy logic, this approach allows to incorporate knowledge-based models for the design of kernels. From this perspective, the most interesting mathematical question is how positive-semideﬁnite fuzzy equivalence relations can be characterized or at least constructed under some circumstances. At least for some special cases, proofs are provided in Section 4, which motivate further research aiming at establishing a more general theory on the positive-deﬁniteness of fuzzy equivalence relations. These cases are based on the most prominent representatives of triangular norms, that is the Minimum, the Product and the Łukasiewicz t-norm. The paper is structured as follows. First of all, in Section 2, some basic prerequisites concerning kernels and fuzzy relations are outlined. In Section 3, a result about the T -transitivity of kernels from Moser (2006) is cited and interpreted as existence statement that guarantees a representation of kernels mapping to the unit interval with constant 1 in its diagonal by a certain, commonly used, fuzzy-logical construction of a fuzzy equivalence relation. Finally, in contrast to the pure existence theorem of Section 3, in Section 4 constructive examples of fuzzy equivalence relations are provided which are proven to be kernels. In a concluding remark, the relationship to the problem of labeled and unlabeled learning is pointed out. 2. Prerequisites This section summarizes deﬁnitions and facts from the theory of kernels as well as from fuzzy set theory which are needed later on. 2.1 Kernels and Positive-Semideﬁniteness Preserving Functions There is an extensive literature concerning kernels and kernel-based methods like support vector machines or kernel principal component analysis especially in the machine learning, data mining ¨ and computer vision communities. For an overview and introduction, see, for example, Sch olkopf and Smola (2002). Here we present only what is needed later on. For completeness let us recall the basic deﬁnition for kernels and positive-semideﬁniteness. Deﬁnition 1 Let X be a non-empty set. A real-valued function k : X × X → R is said to be a kernel iff it is symmetric, that is, k(x, y) = k(y, x) for all x, y ∈ X , and positive-semideﬁnite, that is, ∑n j=1 ci c j k(xi , x j ) ≥ 0 for any n ∈ N, any choice of x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X and any choice of c1 , . . . , cn ∈ R. i, One way to generate new kernels from known kernels is to apply operations which preserve the positive-semideﬁniteness property. A characterization of such operations is provided by C. H. FitzGerald (1995). Theorem 2 (Closeness Properties of Kernels) Let f : Rn → R, n ∈ N, then k : X × X → R given by k(x, y) := f (k1 (x, y), . . . , kn (x, y)) 2604 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS is a kernel for any choice of kernels k1 , . . . , kn on X × X iff f is the real restriction of an entire function on Cn of the form f (x1 , . . . , xn ) = ∑ r1 ≥0,...,rn ≥0 r r cr1 ,...,rn x11 · · · xnn (1) where cr1 ,...,rn ≥ 0 for all nonnegative indices r1 , . . . , rn . 2.2 Triangular Norms Triangular norms have been originally studied within the framework of probabilistic metric spaces, see Schweizer and Sklar (1961) and Schweizer and Sklar (1983). In this context, t-norms proved to be an appropriate concept when dealing with triangle inequalities. Later on, t-norms and their dual version, t-conorms, have been used to model conjunction and disjunction for many-valued logic, see Dubois and Prade (1985), Gottwald (1986), Gottwald (1993) and Klement et al. (2000). Deﬁnition 3 A function T : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] is called t-norm (triangular norm), if it satisﬁes the following conditions: (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) ∀x, y ∈ [0, 1] : ∀x, y, z ∈ [0, 1] : ∀x, y, z ∈ [0, 1] : ∀x, y ∈ [0, 1] : T (x, y) = T (y, x) T (x, T (y, z)) = T (T (x, y), z) y ≤ z =⇒ T (x, y) ≤ T (x, z) T (x, 1) = x ∧ T (1, y) = y (commutativity) (associativity) (monotonicity) (boundary condition) Further, a t-norm is called Archimedean if it is continuous and satisﬁes x ∈ (0, 1) ⇒ T (x, x) < x. Due to its associativity, many-placed extensions Tn : [0, 1]n → [0, 1], n ∈ N, of a t-norm T are uniquely determined by Tn (x1 , . . . , xn ) = T (x1 , Tn−1 (x2 , . . . , xn )). Archimedean t-norms are characterized by the following representation theorem due to Ling (1965): Theorem 4 Let T : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] be a t-norm. Then T is Archimedean if, and only if, there is a continuous, strictly decreasing function f : [0, 1] → [0, ∞] with f (1) = 0 such that for x, y ∈ [0, 1], T (x, y) = f −1 (min( f (x) + f (y), f (0))). By setting g(x) = exp (− f (x)), Ling’s characterization yields an alternative representation with a multiplicative generator function T (x, y) = g−1 (max(g(x) g(y), g(0))). For g(x) = x we get the product TP (x, y) = x y. The setting f (x) = 1 − x yields the so-called Łukasiewcz t-norm TL (x, y) = max(x + y − 1, 0). Due to Ling’s theorem 4 an Archimedean t-norm T is isomorphic either to TL or TP , depending on whether the additive generator takes a ﬁnite value at 0 or not. In the former case, the Archimedean t-norm is called non-strict, in the latter it is called strict. 2605 M OSER A many-valued model of an implication is provided by the so-called residuum given by → T (a, b) = sup{c ∈ [0, 1]|T (a, c) ≤ b} (2) where T is a left-continuous t-norm. Equation (2) is uniquely determined by the so-called adjunction property → ∀a, b, c ∈ [0, 1] : T (a, b) ≤ c ⇔ a ≤ T (b, c). Consequently, the operator ↔ → → T (a, b) = min T (a, b), T (b, a) (3) (4) models a biimplication. For details, for example, see Gottwald (1986) and Klement et al. (2000). → Tables 1 and 2 list examples of t-norms with their induced residuum T . For further examples see, for example, Klement et al. (2000). √ √ Tcos (a, b) = max(ab − 1 − a2 1 − b2 , 0) TL (a, b) = max(a + b − 1, 0) TP (a, b) = ab TM (a, b) = min(a, b) Table 1: Examples of t-norms → T cos (a, b) = → T L (a, b) = → = T P (a, b) → T M (a, b) = cos(arccos(b) − arccos(a)) if a > b, 1 else min(b − a + 1, 1) b if a > b, a 1 else b if a > b, 1 else Table 2: Examples of residuums 2.3 T -Equivalences If we want to classify based on a notion of similarity or indistinguishability, we face the problem of transitivity. For instance, let us consider two real numbers to be indistinguishable if and only if they differ by at most a certain bound ε > 0, this is modeled by the relation ∼ ε given by x ∼ε y :⇔ |x−y| < ε, ε > 0, x, y ∈ R. Note that the relation ∼ε is not transitive and, therefore, not an equivalence relation. The transitivity requirement turns out to be too strong for this example. The problem of identiﬁcation and transitivity in the context of similarity of physical objects was early pointed out and discussed philosophically by Poincar´ (1902) and Poincar´ (1904). In the framework of fuzzy e e logic, the way to overcome this problem is to model similarity by fuzzy relations based on a many¨ valued concept of transitivity, see Bodenhofer (2003), H ohle (1993), H¨ hle (1999), Klement et al. o (2000) and Zadeh (1971). 2606 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS Deﬁnition 5 A function E : X 2 −→ [0, 1] is called a fuzzy equivalence relation, or synonymously, T -equivalence with respect to the t-norm T if it satisﬁes the following conditions: (i) ∀x ∈ X : E(x, x) = 1 (reﬂexivity) (ii) ∀x, y ∈ X : E(x, y) = E(y, x) (symmetry) (iii) ∀x, y, z ∈ X : T (E(x, y), E(y, z)) ≤ E(x, z) (T-transitivity). The value E(x, y) can be also looked at as the (quasi) truth value of the statement “x is equal to y”. Following this semantics, T-transitivity can be seen as a many-valued model of the proposition, “If x is equal to y and y is equal to z, then x is equal to z”. T -equivalences for Archimedean t-norms are closely related to metrics and pseudo-metrics as shown by Klement et al. (2000) and Moser (1995). Theorem 6 Let T be an Archimedean t-norm given by ∀a, b ∈ [0, 1] : T (a, b) = f −1 (min( f (a) + f (b), f (0))), where f : [0, 1] → [0, ∞] is a strictly decreasing, continuous function with f (1) = 0. (i) If d : X 2 → [0, ∞[ is a pseudo-metric, then the function Ed : X 2 → [0, 1] deﬁned by Ed (x, y) = f −1 (min(d(x, y), f (0))) is a T -equivalence with respect to the t-norm T . (ii) If E : X 2 → [0, 1] is a T -equivalence relation, then the function dE : X 2 → [0, ∞] deﬁned by dE (x, y) = f (E(x, y)) is a pseudo-metric. → Another way to construct T -equivalences is to employ T -operators. The proof of the following assertion can be found in Trillas and Valverde (1984), Kruse et al. (1993) and Kruse et al. (1994). ↔ Theorem 7 Let T be a left-continuous t-norm, T its induced biimplication, µi : X → [0, 1], i ∈ I, I non-empty; then E : X × X → [0, 1] given by ↔ E(x, y) = inf T (µi (x), µi (y)) i∈I (5) is a T -equivalence relation. ¨ For further details on T -equivalences see also Boixader and Jacas (1999), H oppner et al. (2002), Jacas (1988), Trillas et al. (1999) and Valverde (1985). 3. Representing Kernels by T -Equivalences It is interesting that the concept of kernels, which is motivated by geometric reasoning in terms of inner products and mappings to Hilbert spaces and which is inherently formulated by algebraic terms, is closely related to the concept of fuzzy equivalence relations as demonstrated and discussed in more detail in Moser (2006). In this section, we start with the result that any kernel k : X × X → [0, 1] with k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X is T -transitive and, therefore, a fuzzy equivalence relation. The proof can be found in Moser (2006), see also Appendix A.1. 2607 M OSER Theorem 8 Any kernel k : X × X → [0, 1] with k(x, x) = 1 is (at least) Tcos -transitive, where 1 − a2 Tcos (a, b) = max{a b − 1 − b2 , 0}. (6) The nomenclature is motivated by the fact that the triangular norm deﬁned by Equation (6) is an Archimedean t-norm which is generated by the arcosine function as its additive generator. From this result, the following existence theorem can be derived, which guarantees that any kernel under consideration can be represented by the fuzzy-logical formula given by (5). In fuzzy systems, this formula is commonly used for modeling rule bases (see, for example, Kruse et al., 1993, 1994). Theorem 9 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, k : X × X → [0, 1] a kernel in the sense of Deﬁnition 1 and k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X ; then there is a family of membership functions µ i : X → [0, 1], i ∈ I, I non-empty and a t-norm T , such that ↔ ∀x, y ∈ X : k(x, y) = inf T (µi (x), µi (y)). i∈I (7) Proof. Let us set I := X , µx0 (x) = k(x, x0 ) and let us choose Tcos as t-norm. For convenience let us denote ↔ h(x, y) = inf T cos (µx0 (x), µx0 (y)), x0 ∈X which is equivalent to ↔ h(x, y) = inf T cos (k(x0 , x), k(x0 , y)). x0 ∈X According to Theorem 8, k is Tcos -transitive, that is, ↔ ∀x0 , x, y ∈ X : T cos (k(x0 , x), k(x0 , y)) ≤ k(x, y). This implies that h(x, y) ≤ k(x, y) for all x, y ∈ X . Now let us consider the other inequality. Due to the adjunction property (3), we obtain → Tcos (k(x, y), k(x0 , y)) ≤ k(x, x0 ) ⇔ k(x, y) ≤ T cos (k(x0 , y), k(x, x0 )) and → Tcos (k(x, y), k(x0 , x)) ≤ k(y, x0 ) ⇔ k(x, y) ≤ T cos (k(x0 , x), k(y, x0 )), from which it follows that → → ∀x, y, x0 ∈ X : k(x, y) ≤ min{ T cos (k(x0 , y), k(x, x0 )), T cos (k(x0 , x), k(y, x0 ))}. Hence by Deﬁnition 4, ∀x, y ∈ X : k(x, y) ≤ h(x, y) which ends the proof. For an arbitrary choice of fuzzy membership functions, there is no necessity that the resulting relation (7) implies positive-semideﬁniteness and, therefore, a kernel. For an example of a Tcos equivalence which is not a kernel see Appendix A.4. Theorem 9 guarantees only the existence of a representation of the form (5) but it does not tell us how to construct the membership functions µ i . In the following section, we provide examples of fuzzy equivalence relations which yield kernels for any choice of membership functions. 2608 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS 4. Constructing Kernels by Fuzzy Equivalence Relations In the Boolean case, positive-deﬁniteness and equivalence are synonymous, that is, a Boolean relation R : X × X → {0, 1} is positive-deﬁnite if and only if R is the indicator function of an equivalence relation ∼ that is, R(x, y) = 1 if x ∼ y and R(x, y) = 0 if x ∼ y. For a proof, see Appendix A.2. This = = =, relationship can be used to obtain an extension to fuzzy relations as given by the next theorem whose proof can be found in the Appendix A.3. Theorem 10 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, µ i : X → [0, 1], i ∈ I, I non-empty; then the fuzzy equivalence relation EM : X × X → [0, 1] given by ↔ EM (x, y) = inf T M (µi (x), µi (y)) i∈I is positive-semideﬁnite. In the following, the most prominent representatives of Archimedean t-norms, the Product TP and the Łukasiewicz t-norm TL , are used to construct positive-semideﬁnite fuzzy similarity relations. Though the ﬁrst part can also be derived from a result due to Yaglom (1957) that characterizes isotropic stationary kernels by its spectral representation, here we prefer to present a direct, elementary proof. Compare also Bochner (1955) and Genton (2001). Theorem 11 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, ν : X → [0, 1] and let h : [0, 1] → [0, 1] be an isomorphism of the unit interval that can be expanded in the manner of Equation (1), that is h(x) = ∑k ck xk with ck ≥ 0; then the fuzzy equivalence relations EL,h , EP,h : X × X → [0, 1] given by ↔ EL,h (x, y) = h T L h−1 (ν(x)) , h−1 (ν(y)) and ↔ EP,h (x, y) = h T P h−1 (ν(x)) , h−1 (ν(y)) (8) (9) are positive-semideﬁnite. Proof. To prove the positive-deﬁniteness of the two-placed functions E L,h and EP,h given by equations (8) and (9) respectively, we have to show that n n ∑ i, j=1 EL,h (xi , xi ) ci c j ≥ 0, ∑ i, j=1 EP,h (xi , x j ) ci c j ≥ 0 for any n ∈ N and any choice of x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X , respectively. According to an elementary result from Linear Algebra this is equivalent to the assertion that the determinants (1 ≤ m ≤ n) Dm = det (E(xi , x j ))i, j∈{1,...,m} of the minors of the matrix (E(xi , x j ))i, j satisfy ∀m ∈ {1, . . . , n} : Dm ≥ 0, where E denotes either EL,h or EP,h . Recall that the determinant of a matrix is invariant with respect to renaming the indices, that is, if σ : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n} is a permutation then det [(ai j )i, j ] = det (aσ(i)σ( j) )i, j . 2609 M OSER For convenience, let denote µi = h−1 (ν(xi )). Then, without loss of generality, we may assume that the values µi are ordered monotonically decreasing, that is, µi ≥ µ j for i < j. ↔ → (10) → Case TL : Note that T L (a, b) = min{ T L (a, b), T L (b, a)} = 1 − |a − b|. Then we have to show that for all dimensions n ∈ N, the determinant of E (n) = (1 − |µi − µ j |)i, j∈{1,...,n} is non-negative, that is Due to the assumption (10), we have det[E (n) ] ≥ 0. 1 − |µi − µ j | = 1 − (µi − µ j ) if i ≤ j, 1 − (µ j − µi ) else which yields   . . . 1 − (µ1 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ1 − µn )  . . . 1 − (µ2 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ2 − µn )     . . . 1 − (µ3 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ3 − µn )    (n) E = . . . .. . .   . . .   1 − (µ1 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ2 − µn−1 ) . . . 1 1 − (µn−1 − µn ) 1 − (µ1 − µn ) 1 − (µ2 − µn ) . . . 1 − (µn−1 − µn ) 1 1 − (µ1 − µ2 ) 1 1 − (µ2 − µ3 ) . . . 1 1 − (µ1 − µ2 ) 1 − (µ1 − µ3 ) . . .

(12) G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS Let us apply Laplacian determinant expansion by minors to the ﬁrst column of matrix (12), that is n det[A] = ∑ (−1)i+ j ai j det[Ai j ] i=1 where A = (ai j ) is an n × n-matrix, j arbitrarily chosen from {1, . . . , n} and Ai j is the matrix corresponding to the cofactor ai j obtained by canceling out the i-th row and the j-th column from A (see, ˆ for example, Muir, 1960). For n = 1, we get the trivial case det[ E (1) ] = 1. Note that the ﬁrst and (n) ˆ the last rows of the matrices Ei,1 for 1 < i < n only differ by their signum, consequently the minors ˆ (n) det[Ei,1 ] for 1 < i < n, n ≥ 2, are vanishing, that is, det[Ai,1 ] = 0, for 1 < i < n. Therefore, according to the Laplacian expansion, we get (n) (n) ˆ ˆ ˆ det[E (n) ] = 1 · det[E1,1 ] + (−1)n (1 − (µ1 − µn )) · det[E1,n ]. (13) Observe that (n) ˆ det[E1,1 ] = 2n−2 (n) ˆ det[E1,n ] = (−1)n−1 2n−2 . Consequently, Equation (13) simpliﬁes to ˆ det[E (n) ] = 2n−2 1 + (−1)n (−1)n−1 2n−2 (1 − (µ1 − µn )) = 2n−2 (1 − (1 − (µ1 − µn ))) = 2n−2 (µ1 − µn ) ≥ 0 which together with (11) proves the ﬁrst case. ↔ → → Case TP : First of all, let us compute T P (a, b) = min{ T P (a, b), T L (b, a)}.

Again, without loss of generality, let us suppose that the values µ i , i ∈ {1, . . . , n} are ordered monotonically decreasing, that is µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ . . . ≥ µn . Before checking the general case, let us consider the special case of vanishing µ-values. For this, let us assume for the moment that µi = > 0 if i < i0 , 0 else ↔ ↔ which implies that T P (µi , µ j ) = 0 for i < i0 and j ≥ i0 and T P (µi , µ j ) = 1 for i ≥ i0 and j ≥ i0 . This leads to a decomposition of the matrix ↔ E (n) = T P (µi , µ j ) 2611 ij M OSER such that det[E (n) ] = det[E (i0 −1) ] · det[In−i0 −1 ] where Ik denotes the k × k-matrix with constant entries 1, hence det[In−i0 −1 ] ∈ {0, 1}. Therefore, we may assume that µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ . . . ≥ µn > 0. Then we have to show that for all dimensions n ∈ N, the determinant of µi µ j , µ j µi E (n) = min i, j∈{1,...,n} is non-negative, that is det[E (n) ] ≥ 0.

By this, the determinant of the matrix in Equation (15) readily turns out to be n−1 µi+1 ˜ det[E (n) ] = det[E (n) ] = ∏ 1 − µi i=1 2 ≥0 which together with Theorem (2) ends the proof. Note that relations (8) and (9) are T -transitive with respect to the corresponding isomorphic Archimedean t-norms, TL,h (x, y) = h(TL (h−1 (x), h−1 (x))) and TP,h (x, y) = h(TP (h−1 (x), h−1 (x))), respectively. 2612 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS Corollary 12 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, µ i : X → [0, 1], λi ∈ ]0, 1] with ∑i λi = 1 ˜ ˜ where i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, n ∈ N, then the fuzzy equivalence relations EL , EP : X × X → [0, 1] given by n ↔ ˜ EL (x, y) = ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)) (16) i=1 and n ↔ ˜ EP (x, y) = ∏ T P (µi (x), µi (y)) λi (17) i=1 are TL - and TP -equivalences, respectively, and kernels. Proof. First of all, let us check the TL -transitivity of formula (16). This can readily be shown by ↔ means of the deﬁnition of TL and the TL -transitivity of T L due to the following inequalities: n TL n ↔ i=1 n n ↔ ↔ n ↔ ↔ ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)) + ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (z)) − 1 , 0 i=1 i=1 n max = i=1 i=1 n = i=1 ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)) + ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (z)) − 1, 0 max max ↔ ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)), ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (yz) n ↔ ↔ ∑ λi TL T L (µi (x), µi (y)), ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (z)) , 0 i=1 i=1 n max ↔ ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (z)), 0 ≤ ≤ = i=1 ↔ λi T L (µi (x), µi (z)). ↔ This, together with the TP -transitivity of T P , proves that the formulas given by (16) and (17) are TL and TP -equivalences, respectively. Expanding the factors of formula (17) yields  1 if µi (x) = µi (y) = 0, λi ↔ λi λi (18) T P (µi (x), µi (y)) =  min(µiλi(x),µiλi(y)) else max(µi (x),µi (y)) which by comparing case TP of the proof of Theorem 11 shows that the left-hand side of Equation (18) is positive-semideﬁnite. As the convex combination and the product are special cases of positive-semideﬁniteness preserving functions according to Theorem 1, the functions deﬁned by equations (16) and (17) prove to be again positive-semideﬁnite and, therefore, kernels. It is interesting to observe that both formulas (16) and (17) can be expressed in the form, f ( τ(x) − τ(y) 1 ), where f : I → [0, 1], I some interval, is a strictly decreasing function, τ : X → I n , I some interval, τ(x) = (τ1 (x), . . . , τn (x)) and τ(x) 1 = ∑n |τi (x)|. Indeed, for Equation (16) let us deﬁne i=1 fL : [0, 1] → [0, 1], fL (a) = 1 − a τL : X → [0, 1] , τL (x) = (λ1 µ1 (x), . . . , λn µn (x)) n 2613 M OSER and for Equation (17) and positive membership functions µ i , µi (x) > 0 for all x ∈ X , let us deﬁne fP : [0, ∞[→ [0, 1], fP (a) = e−a τP : X → ] − ∞, 1]n , τP (x) = (λ1 ln(µ1 (x)), . . . , λn ln(µn (x))) Therefore, we get ˜ EL (x, y) = 1 − τL (x) − τL (y) ˜ EP (x, y) = e− τP (x)−τP (y) 1 . 1 (19) (20) While formulas (19) and (20) provide a geometrical interpretation by means of the norm . 1 , the corresponding formulas (16) and (17) yield a semantical model of the assertion “IF x is equal to y with respect to feature µ1 AND . . . AND x is equal to y with respect to feature µn THEN x is equal to y” as aggregation of biimplications in terms of fuzzy logic. While in the former case, the aggregation has some compensatory effect, the latter is just a conjunction in terms of the Product triangular norm. For details on aggregation operators see, for example, Saminger et al. (2002) and Calvo et al. (2002). The formulas (16) and (17) coincide for the following special case. If the membership functions µi are indicator functions of sets Ai ⊆ X which form a partition of X , then the kernels (16) and (17) reduce to the indicator function characterizing the Boolean equivalence relation induced by this partition {A1 , . . . , An }. The formulas (16) and (17) for general membership functions therefore provide kernels which can be interpreted to be induced by a family of fuzzy sets and, in particular, by fuzzy partitions, that is, families of fuzzy sets fulﬁlling some criteria which extend the axioms for a Boolean partition in a many-valued logical sense. For deﬁnitions and further details on fuzzy partitions see, for ¨ example, De Baets and Mesiar (1998), Demirci (2003) and H oppner and Klawonn (2003). It is a frequently used paradigm that the decision boundaries for a classiﬁcation problem lie between clusters rather than intersecting them. Due to this cluster hypothesis, the problem of designing kernels based on fuzzy partitions is closely related to the problem of learning kernels from unlabeled data. For further details on semi-supervised learning see, for example, Seeger (2002), Chapelle et al. (2003) and T. M. Huang (2006). It is left to future research to explore this relationship to the problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data and related concepts like covariance kernels. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have presented a novel view on kernels from a fuzzy logical point of view. Particularly, the similarity-measure aspect of a kernel is addressed and investigated by means of the so-called T -transitivity which is characteristic for fuzzy equivalence relations. As a consequence, we derived that a large class of kernels can be represented in a way that is commonly used for representing fuzzy rule bases. In addition to this proof for the existence of such a representation, constructive examples are presented. It is the idea of this research to look for a combination of knowledge-based strategies with kernel-based methods in order to facilitate a more ﬂexible designing process of kernels which also allows to incorporate prior knowledge. Further research aims at 2614 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS analyzing the behavior of kernels constructed in this way when applied in the various kernel methods like support vector machines, kernel principal components analysis and others. In particular, it is intended to focus on the problem of learning kernels from unlabeled data where the fuzzy partitions are induced by appropriate clustering principles.

For sake of completeness the following sections provide proofs regarding Theorem 8, the characterization of kernels in the Boolean case and the construction of kernels by means of the minimum t-norm TM . Furthermore, in Section A.4 an example of a non-positive-semideﬁnite Tcos -equivalence is given. A.1 Proof of Theorem 8 Let us start with the analysis of 3-dimensional matrices. Lemma 13 Let M = (mi j )i j ∈ [0, 1]3×3 be a 3 × 3 symmetric matrix with mii = 1, i = 1, 2, 3; then M is positive-semideﬁnite iff for all i, j, k ∈ {1, 2, 3} there holds mi j m jk − 1 − m2j i 1 − m2 ≤ mik jk Proof. For simplicity, let a = m1,2 , b = m1,3 and c = m2,3 . Then the determinant of M, Det(M), is a function of the variables a, b, c given by D(a, b, c) = 1 + 2abc − a2 − b2 − c2 . For any choice of a, b, the quadratic equation D(a, b, c) = 0 can be solved for c, yielding two solutions c1 = c1 (a, b) and c2 = c2 (a, b) as functions of a and b, c1 (a, b) = ab − c2 (a, b) = ab + 1 − a2 1 − a2 1 − b2 1 − b2 . Obviously, for all |a| ≤ 1 and |b| ≤ 1, the values c1 (a, b) and c2 (a, b) are real. By substituting a = cos α and b = cos(β) with α, β ∈ [0, π ], it becomes readily clear that 2 c1 (a, b) = c1 (cos(α), cos(β)) = cos(α) cos(β) − sin(α) sin(β) = cos(α + β) ∈ [−1, 1] 2615 M OSER and, analogously, c2 (a, b) = c2 (cos(α), cos(β)) = cos(α) cos(β) + sin(α) sin(β) = cos(α − β) ∈ [−1, 1]. As for all a, b ∈ [−1, 1] the determinant function Da,b (c) := D(a, b, c) is quadratic in c with negative coefﬁcient for c2 , there is a uniquely determined maximum at c0 (a, b) = ab. Note that for all a, b ∈ [−1, 1], we have c1 (a, b) ≤ c0 (a, b) ≤ c2 (a, b) and D(a, b, c0 (a, b)) = 1 + 2ab(ab) − a2 − b2 − (ab)2 = (1 − a2 )(1 − b2 ) ≥ 0. Therefore, D(a, b, c) ≥ 0 if and only if c ∈ [c1 (a, b), c2 (a, b)]. Recall from linear algebra that by renaming the indices, the determinant does not change. Therefore, without loss of generality, we may assume that a ≥ b ≥ c. For convenience, let Q = {(x, y, z) ∈ [0, 1]3 |x ≥ y ≥ z}. Then, obviously, for any choice of a, b ∈ [0, 1] there holds (a, b, c1 (a, b)) ∈ Q. Elementary algebra shows that (a, b, c2 (a, b)) ∈ Q is only the case for a = b = 1. As for a = b = 1 the two solutions c1 , c2 coincide, that is, c1 (1, 1) = c2 (1, 1) = 1, it follows that for any choice of (a, b, c) ∈ Q, there holds D(a, b, c) ≥ 0 if and only if c1 (a, b) = ab − 1 − a2 1 − b2 ≤ c. (21) If (a, b, c) ∈ Q, then the inequality (21) is trivially satisﬁed which together with (21) proves the lemma Now Theorem 8 immediately follows from Deﬁnition (1), Lemma (13) and the characterizing inequality (21). A.2 Characterization of Kernels in the Boolean Case ¨ The following lemma and proposition can also be found as an exercise in Sch olkopf and Smola (2002). Lemma 14 Let ∼ be an equivalence relation on X and let k : X × X → {0, 1} be induced by ∼ via k(x, y) = 1 if and only if x ∼ y; then k is a kernel. Proof. By deﬁnition of positive-deﬁniteness, let us consider an arbitrary sequence of elements x1 , . . . , xn . Then there are at most n equivalence classes Q1 , . . . , Qm on the set of indices {1, . . . , n}, S / m ≤ n, where i=1,...,m Qi = {1, . . . , n} and Qi ∩ Q j = 0 for i = j. Note that k(xi , x j ) = 0 if the indices 2616 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS i, j belong to different equivalence classes. Then, for any choice of reals c 1 , . . . , cn , we obtain ∑ ci c j k(xi , x j ) m = i, j ∑ ∑ ci c j k(xi , x j ) p=1 i, j∈Q p m = ∑ ∑ p=1 i, j∈Q p ci c j · 1 2 m = ∑ ∑ ci p=1 i∈Q p ≥ 0 Proposition 15 k : X × X → {0, 1} with k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X is a kernel if and only if it is induced by an equivalence relation. Proof. It only remains to be shown that if k is a kernel, then it is the indicator function of an equivalence relation, that is, it is induced by an equivalence relation. If k is a kernel, according to Lemma 13, for all x, y, z ∈ X , it has to satisfy Tcos (k(x, y), k(y, z)) ≤ k(x, z), which implies, k(x, y) = 1, k(y, z) = 1 =⇒ k(x, z) = 1. Obviously, we have k(x, x) = 1 and k(x, y) = k(y, x) due to the reﬂexivity and symmetry assumption of k, respectively. A.3 Constructing Kernels by TM For convenience let us recall the basic notion of an α-cut from fuzzy set theory: Deﬁnition 16 Let X be a non-empty set and µ : X → [0, 1]; then [µ]α = {x ∈ X | µ(x) ≥ α} is called the α-cut of the membership function µ. Lemma 17 k : X × X → [0, 1] is a TM -equivalence if and only if all α-cuts of k are Boolean equivalence relations. Proof. (i) Let us assume that k is a TM -equivalence. Let α ∈ [0, 1], then by deﬁnition, [k]α = {(x, y) ∈ X × X | k(x, y) ≥ α}. In order to show that [k]α is a Boolean equivalence, the axioms for reﬂexivity, symmetry and transitivity have to be shown. Reﬂexivity and symmetry are trivially satisﬁed as for all x, y ∈ X , there holds by assumption that k(x, x) = 1 and k(x, y) = k(y, x). In order to show transitivity, let us consider (x, y), (y, z) ∈ [k]α , that means k(x, y) ≥ α and k(y, z) ≥ α; then by the TM -transitivity assumption it follows that α ≤ min(k(x, y), k(y, z)) ≤ k(x, z), hence (x, z) ∈ [k]α . 2617 M OSER (ii) Suppose now that all α-cuts of k are Boolean equivalence relations. Then, in particular, [k] α with α = 1 is reﬂexive, hence k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X . The symmetry of k follows from the fact that for all α ∈ [0, 1] and pairs (x, y) ∈ [k]α , by assumption, we have (y, x) ∈ [k]α . In order to show the TM -transitivity property, let us consider arbitrarily chosen elements x, y, z ∈ X . Let α = min(k(x, y), k(y, z)); then by the transitivity assumption of [k] α , it follows that (x, z) ∈ [k]α , consequently k(x, z) ≥ α = min(k(x, y), k(y, z)). Proposition 18 If k : X × X → [0, 1] is a TM -equivalence then it is positive-semideﬁnite. Proof. Choose arbitrary elements x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X and consider the set of values which are taken by all combinations k(xi , x j ), i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} and order them increasingly, that is k(xi , x j )| i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}} = {α1 , . . . , αm , where 0 ≤ α1 ≤ · · · αm ≤ 1. Observe that for all pairs (xi , x j ), i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} there holds m k(xi , x j ) = ∑ (αv − αv−1 )1[k] αv v=2 (xi , x j ) + α1 1[k]α1 (xi , x j ) showing that on the set {x1 , . . . , xn } × {x1 , . . . , xn }, the function k is a linear combination of indicator functions of Boolean equivalences (which are positive-semideﬁnite by Proposition 15) with nonnegative coefﬁcients and, consequently, it has to be positive semideﬁnite. A.4 Example of a Non-Positive-Semideﬁnite Tcos -Equivalence For dimensions n > 3, the Tcos -transitivity is no longer sufﬁcient to guarantee positive semi(n) deﬁniteness. Consider, for example An = (ai j )i j where  λ  (n) ai j = 1   0 if min(i, j) = 1, max(i, j) > 1 , if i = j, else . (22) √ (n) (n) (n) Choose λ = 1/ 2, then Tcos (λ, λ) = 0, hence we have Tcos (ai j , a jk ) ≤ aik for all indices i, j, k ∈ 1, . . . , n. As det(An ) < 0 for n > 3, the matrix An cannot be positive-semideﬁnite though the Tcos transitivity conditions are satisﬁed. References S. Bochner. Harmonic Analysis and the Theory of Probability.

<p>Author: Pavel Laskov, Christian Gehl, Stefan Krüger, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Incremental Support Vector Machines (SVM) are instrumental in practical applications of online learning. This work focuses on the design and analysis of efﬁcient incremental SVM learning, with the aim of providing a fast, numerically stable and robust implementation. A detailed analysis of convergence and of algorithmic complexity of incremental SVM learning is carried out. Based on this analysis, a new design of storage and numerical operations is proposed, which speeds up the training of an incremental SVM by a factor of 5 to 20. The performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated in two scenarios: learning with limited resources and active learning. Various applications of the algorithm, such as in drug discovery, online monitoring of industrial devices and and surveillance of network trafﬁc, can be foreseen.

<p>Author: Fu Chang, Chin-Chin Lin, Chi-Jen Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a number of adaptive prototype learning (APL) algorithms. They employ the same algorithmic scheme to determine the number and location of prototypes, but differ in the use of samples or the weighted averages of samples as prototypes, and also in the assumption of distance measures. To understand these algorithms from a theoretical viewpoint, we address their convergence properties, as well as their consistency under certain conditions. We also present a soft version of APL, in which a non-zero training error is allowed in order to enhance the generalization power of the resultant classifier. Applying the proposed algorithms to twelve UCI benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that they outperform many instance-based learning algorithms, the k-nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machines in terms of average test accuracy.

<p>Author: Ting Liu, Andrew W. Moore, Alexander Gray</p><p>Abstract: This paper is about non-approximate acceleration of high-dimensional nonparametric operations such as k nearest neighbor classiﬁers. We attempt to exploit the fact that even if we want exact answers to nonparametric queries, we usually do not need to explicitly ﬁnd the data points close to the query, but merely need to answer questions about the properties of that set of data points. This offers a small amount of computational leeway, and we investigate how much that leeway can be exploited. This is applicable to many algorithms in nonparametric statistics, memory-based learning and kernel-based learning. But for clarity, this paper concentrates on pure k-NN classiﬁcation. We introduce new ball-tree algorithms that on real-world data sets give accelerations from 2-fold to 100-fold compared against highly optimized traditional ball-tree-based k-NN . These results include data sets with up to 106 dimensions and 105 records, and demonstrate non-trivial speed-ups while giving exact answers. keywords: ball-tree, k-NN classiﬁcation</p><p>3 0.2474169 <a title="13-lsi-3" href="./jmlr-2006-Accurate_Error_Bounds_for_the_Eigenvalues_of_the_Kernel_Matrix.html">9 jmlr-2006-Accurate Error Bounds for the Eigenvalues of the Kernel Matrix</a></p>
<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun</p><p>Abstract: The eigenvalues of the kernel matrix play an important role in a number of kernel methods, in particular, in kernel principal component analysis. It is well known that the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix converge as the number of samples tends to inﬁnity. We derive probabilistic ﬁnite sample size bounds on the approximation error of individual eigenvalues which have the important property that the bounds scale with the eigenvalue under consideration, reﬂecting the actual behavior of the approximation errors as predicted by asymptotic results and observed in numerical simulations. Such scaling bounds have so far only been known for tail sums of eigenvalues. Asymptotically, the bounds presented here have a slower than stochastic rate, but the number of sample points necessary to make this disadvantage noticeable is often unrealistically large. Therefore, under practical conditions, and for all but the largest few eigenvalues, the bounds presented here form a signiﬁcant improvement over existing non-scaling bounds.

<p>Author: Bernhard Moser</p><p>Abstract: Kernels are two-placed functions that can be interpreted as inner products in some Hilbert space. It is this property which makes kernels predestinated to carry linear models of learning, optimization or classiﬁcation strategies over to non-linear variants. Following this idea, various kernel-based methods like support vector machines or kernel principal component analysis have been conceived which prove to be successful for machine learning, data mining and computer vision applications. When applying a kernel-based method a central question is the choice and the design of the kernel function. This paper provides a novel view on kernels based on fuzzy-logical concepts which allows to incorporate prior knowledge in the design process. It is demonstrated that kernels mapping to the unit interval with constant one in its diagonal can be represented by a commonly used fuzzylogical formula for representing fuzzy rule bases. This means that a great class of kernels can be represented by fuzzy-logical concepts. Apart from this result, which only guarantees the existence of such a representation, constructive examples are presented and the relation to unlabeled learning is pointed out. Keywords: kernel, triangular norm, T -transitivity, fuzzy relation, residuum 1. Motivation Positive-deﬁniteness plays a prominent role especially in optimization and machine learning due to the fact that two-place functions with this property, so-called kernels, can be represented as inner products in some Hilbert space. Thereby, optimization techniques conceived on the basis of linear models can be extended to non-linear algorithms. For a survey of applications see, for example, ¨ Jolliffe (1986), Sch¨ lkopf and Smola (2002) and Scholkopf et al. (1998). o Recently in Moser (2006) it was shown that kernels with values from the unit interval can be interpreted as fuzzy equivalence relations motivated by the idea that kernels express a kind of similarity. This means that the concept of fuzzy equivalence relations, or synonymously fuzzy similarity relations, is more general than that of kernels, provided only values in the unit interval are considered. Fuzzy equivalence relations distinguish from Boolean equivalence relations by a many-valued extension of transitivity which can be interpreted as many-valued logical model of the statement “IF x is similar to y AND y is similar to z THEN x is similar to z”. In contrast to the Boolean case, in many-valued logics the set of truth values is extended such that also assertions, for example, whether two elements x and y are similar, can be treated as a matter of degree. The standard model for the set of (quasi) truth values of fuzzy logic and other many-valued logical systems is the unit interval. If E(x, y) represents the (quasi) truth value of the statement that x is c 2006 Bernhard Moser. M OSER similar to y, then the many-valued version of transitivity is modeled by T (E(x, y), E(y, z)) ≤ E(x, z) where T is a so-called triangular norm which is an extension of the Boolean conjunction. This many-valued concept for transitivity is called T -transitivity. For a survey on triangular norms see, for example, Dubois and Prade (1985), Gottwald (1986), Gottwald (1993) and Klement et al. (2000), ¨ and for fuzzy equivalence relations and T -transitivity see, for example, Bodenhofer (2003), H ohle (1993), H¨ hle (1999), Klement et al. (2000), and Zadeh (1971). o Based on the semantics of fuzzy logic, this approach allows to incorporate knowledge-based models for the design of kernels. From this perspective, the most interesting mathematical question is how positive-semideﬁnite fuzzy equivalence relations can be characterized or at least constructed under some circumstances. At least for some special cases, proofs are provided in Section 4, which motivate further research aiming at establishing a more general theory on the positive-deﬁniteness of fuzzy equivalence relations. These cases are based on the most prominent representatives of triangular norms, that is the Minimum, the Product and the Łukasiewicz t-norm. The paper is structured as follows. First of all, in Section 2, some basic prerequisites concerning kernels and fuzzy relations are outlined. In Section 3, a result about the T -transitivity of kernels from Moser (2006) is cited and interpreted as existence statement that guarantees a representation of kernels mapping to the unit interval with constant 1 in its diagonal by a certain, commonly used, fuzzy-logical construction of a fuzzy equivalence relation. Finally, in contrast to the pure existence theorem of Section 3, in Section 4 constructive examples of fuzzy equivalence relations are provided which are proven to be kernels. In a concluding remark, the relationship to the problem of labeled and unlabeled learning is pointed out. 2. Prerequisites This section summarizes deﬁnitions and facts from the theory of kernels as well as from fuzzy set theory which are needed later on. 2.1 Kernels and Positive-Semideﬁniteness Preserving Functions There is an extensive literature concerning kernels and kernel-based methods like support vector machines or kernel principal component analysis especially in the machine learning, data mining ¨ and computer vision communities. For an overview and introduction, see, for example, Sch olkopf and Smola (2002). Here we present only what is needed later on. For completeness let us recall the basic deﬁnition for kernels and positive-semideﬁniteness. Deﬁnition 1 Let X be a non-empty set. A real-valued function k : X × X → R is said to be a kernel iff it is symmetric, that is, k(x, y) = k(y, x) for all x, y ∈ X , and positive-semideﬁnite, that is, ∑n j=1 ci c j k(xi , x j ) ≥ 0 for any n ∈ N, any choice of x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X and any choice of c1 , . . . , cn ∈ R. i, One way to generate new kernels from known kernels is to apply operations which preserve the positive-semideﬁniteness property. A characterization of such operations is provided by C. H. FitzGerald (1995). Theorem 2 (Closeness Properties of Kernels) Let f : Rn → R, n ∈ N, then k : X × X → R given by k(x, y) := f (k1 (x, y), . . . , kn (x, y)) 2604 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS is a kernel for any choice of kernels k1 , . . . , kn on X × X iff f is the real restriction of an entire function on Cn of the form f (x1 , . . . , xn ) = ∑ r1 ≥0,...,rn ≥0 r r cr1 ,...,rn x11 · · · xnn (1) where cr1 ,...,rn ≥ 0 for all nonnegative indices r1 , . . . , rn . 2.2 Triangular Norms Triangular norms have been originally studied within the framework of probabilistic metric spaces, see Schweizer and Sklar (1961) and Schweizer and Sklar (1983). In this context, t-norms proved to be an appropriate concept when dealing with triangle inequalities. Later on, t-norms and their dual version, t-conorms, have been used to model conjunction and disjunction for many-valued logic, see Dubois and Prade (1985), Gottwald (1986), Gottwald (1993) and Klement et al. (2000). Deﬁnition 3 A function T : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] is called t-norm (triangular norm), if it satisﬁes the following conditions: (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) ∀x, y ∈ [0, 1] : ∀x, y, z ∈ [0, 1] : ∀x, y, z ∈ [0, 1] : ∀x, y ∈ [0, 1] : T (x, y) = T (y, x) T (x, T (y, z)) = T (T (x, y), z) y ≤ z =⇒ T (x, y) ≤ T (x, z) T (x, 1) = x ∧ T (1, y) = y (commutativity) (associativity) (monotonicity) (boundary condition) Further, a t-norm is called Archimedean if it is continuous and satisﬁes x ∈ (0, 1) ⇒ T (x, x) < x. Due to its associativity, many-placed extensions Tn : [0, 1]n → [0, 1], n ∈ N, of a t-norm T are uniquely determined by Tn (x1 , . . . , xn ) = T (x1 , Tn−1 (x2 , . . . , xn )). Archimedean t-norms are characterized by the following representation theorem due to Ling (1965): Theorem 4 Let T : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] be a t-norm. Then T is Archimedean if, and only if, there is a continuous, strictly decreasing function f : [0, 1] → [0, ∞] with f (1) = 0 such that for x, y ∈ [0, 1], T (x, y) = f −1 (min( f (x) + f (y), f (0))). By setting g(x) = exp (− f (x)), Ling’s characterization yields an alternative representation with a multiplicative generator function T (x, y) = g−1 (max(g(x) g(y), g(0))). For g(x) = x we get the product TP (x, y) = x y. The setting f (x) = 1 − x yields the so-called Łukasiewcz t-norm TL (x, y) = max(x + y − 1, 0). Due to Ling’s theorem 4 an Archimedean t-norm T is isomorphic either to TL or TP , depending on whether the additive generator takes a ﬁnite value at 0 or not. In the former case, the Archimedean t-norm is called non-strict, in the latter it is called strict. 2605 M OSER A many-valued model of an implication is provided by the so-called residuum given by → T (a, b) = sup{c ∈ [0, 1]|T (a, c) ≤ b} (2) where T is a left-continuous t-norm. Equation (2) is uniquely determined by the so-called adjunction property → ∀a, b, c ∈ [0, 1] : T (a, b) ≤ c ⇔ a ≤ T (b, c). Consequently, the operator ↔ → → T (a, b) = min T (a, b), T (b, a) (3) (4) models a biimplication. For details, for example, see Gottwald (1986) and Klement et al. (2000). → Tables 1 and 2 list examples of t-norms with their induced residuum T . For further examples see, for example, Klement et al. (2000). √ √ Tcos (a, b) = max(ab − 1 − a2 1 − b2 , 0) TL (a, b) = max(a + b − 1, 0) TP (a, b) = ab TM (a, b) = min(a, b) Table 1: Examples of t-norms → T cos (a, b) = → T L (a, b) = → = T P (a, b) → T M (a, b) = cos(arccos(b) − arccos(a)) if a > b, 1 else min(b − a + 1, 1) b if a > b, a 1 else b if a > b, 1 else Table 2: Examples of residuums 2.3 T -Equivalences If we want to classify based on a notion of similarity or indistinguishability, we face the problem of transitivity. For instance, let us consider two real numbers to be indistinguishable if and only if they differ by at most a certain bound ε > 0, this is modeled by the relation ∼ ε given by x ∼ε y :⇔ |x−y| < ε, ε > 0, x, y ∈ R. Note that the relation ∼ε is not transitive and, therefore, not an equivalence relation. The transitivity requirement turns out to be too strong for this example. The problem of identiﬁcation and transitivity in the context of similarity of physical objects was early pointed out and discussed philosophically by Poincar´ (1902) and Poincar´ (1904). In the framework of fuzzy e e logic, the way to overcome this problem is to model similarity by fuzzy relations based on a many¨ valued concept of transitivity, see Bodenhofer (2003), H ohle (1993), H¨ hle (1999), Klement et al. o (2000) and Zadeh (1971). 2606 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS Deﬁnition 5 A function E : X 2 −→ [0, 1] is called a fuzzy equivalence relation, or synonymously, T -equivalence with respect to the t-norm T if it satisﬁes the following conditions: (i) ∀x ∈ X : E(x, x) = 1 (reﬂexivity) (ii) ∀x, y ∈ X : E(x, y) = E(y, x) (symmetry) (iii) ∀x, y, z ∈ X : T (E(x, y), E(y, z)) ≤ E(x, z) (T-transitivity). The value E(x, y) can be also looked at as the (quasi) truth value of the statement “x is equal to y”. Following this semantics, T-transitivity can be seen as a many-valued model of the proposition, “If x is equal to y and y is equal to z, then x is equal to z”. T -equivalences for Archimedean t-norms are closely related to metrics and pseudo-metrics as shown by Klement et al. (2000) and Moser (1995). Theorem 6 Let T be an Archimedean t-norm given by ∀a, b ∈ [0, 1] : T (a, b) = f −1 (min( f (a) + f (b), f (0))), where f : [0, 1] → [0, ∞] is a strictly decreasing, continuous function with f (1) = 0. (i) If d : X 2 → [0, ∞[ is a pseudo-metric, then the function Ed : X 2 → [0, 1] deﬁned by Ed (x, y) = f −1 (min(d(x, y), f (0))) is a T -equivalence with respect to the t-norm T . (ii) If E : X 2 → [0, 1] is a T -equivalence relation, then the function dE : X 2 → [0, ∞] deﬁned by dE (x, y) = f (E(x, y)) is a pseudo-metric. → Another way to construct T -equivalences is to employ T -operators. The proof of the following assertion can be found in Trillas and Valverde (1984), Kruse et al. (1993) and Kruse et al. (1994). ↔ Theorem 7 Let T be a left-continuous t-norm, T its induced biimplication, µi : X → [0, 1], i ∈ I, I non-empty; then E : X × X → [0, 1] given by ↔ E(x, y) = inf T (µi (x), µi (y)) i∈I (5) is a T -equivalence relation. ¨ For further details on T -equivalences see also Boixader and Jacas (1999), H oppner et al. (2002), Jacas (1988), Trillas et al. (1999) and Valverde (1985). 3. Representing Kernels by T -Equivalences It is interesting that the concept of kernels, which is motivated by geometric reasoning in terms of inner products and mappings to Hilbert spaces and which is inherently formulated by algebraic terms, is closely related to the concept of fuzzy equivalence relations as demonstrated and discussed in more detail in Moser (2006). In this section, we start with the result that any kernel k : X × X → [0, 1] with k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X is T -transitive and, therefore, a fuzzy equivalence relation. The proof can be found in Moser (2006), see also Appendix A.1. 2607 M OSER Theorem 8 Any kernel k : X × X → [0, 1] with k(x, x) = 1 is (at least) Tcos -transitive, where 1 − a2 Tcos (a, b) = max{a b − 1 − b2 , 0}. (6) The nomenclature is motivated by the fact that the triangular norm deﬁned by Equation (6) is an Archimedean t-norm which is generated by the arcosine function as its additive generator. From this result, the following existence theorem can be derived, which guarantees that any kernel under consideration can be represented by the fuzzy-logical formula given by (5). In fuzzy systems, this formula is commonly used for modeling rule bases (see, for example, Kruse et al., 1993, 1994). Theorem 9 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, k : X × X → [0, 1] a kernel in the sense of Deﬁnition 1 and k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X ; then there is a family of membership functions µ i : X → [0, 1], i ∈ I, I non-empty and a t-norm T , such that ↔ ∀x, y ∈ X : k(x, y) = inf T (µi (x), µi (y)). i∈I (7) Proof. Let us set I := X , µx0 (x) = k(x, x0 ) and let us choose Tcos as t-norm. For convenience let us denote ↔ h(x, y) = inf T cos (µx0 (x), µx0 (y)), x0 ∈X which is equivalent to ↔ h(x, y) = inf T cos (k(x0 , x), k(x0 , y)). x0 ∈X According to Theorem 8, k is Tcos -transitive, that is, ↔ ∀x0 , x, y ∈ X : T cos (k(x0 , x), k(x0 , y)) ≤ k(x, y). This implies that h(x, y) ≤ k(x, y) for all x, y ∈ X . Now let us consider the other inequality. Due to the adjunction property (3), we obtain → Tcos (k(x, y), k(x0 , y)) ≤ k(x, x0 ) ⇔ k(x, y) ≤ T cos (k(x0 , y), k(x, x0 )) and → Tcos (k(x, y), k(x0 , x)) ≤ k(y, x0 ) ⇔ k(x, y) ≤ T cos (k(x0 , x), k(y, x0 )), from which it follows that → → ∀x, y, x0 ∈ X : k(x, y) ≤ min{ T cos (k(x0 , y), k(x, x0 )), T cos (k(x0 , x), k(y, x0 ))}. Hence by Deﬁnition 4, ∀x, y ∈ X : k(x, y) ≤ h(x, y) which ends the proof. For an arbitrary choice of fuzzy membership functions, there is no necessity that the resulting relation (7) implies positive-semideﬁniteness and, therefore, a kernel. For an example of a Tcos equivalence which is not a kernel see Appendix A.4. Theorem 9 guarantees only the existence of a representation of the form (5) but it does not tell us how to construct the membership functions µ i . In the following section, we provide examples of fuzzy equivalence relations which yield kernels for any choice of membership functions. 2608 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS 4. Constructing Kernels by Fuzzy Equivalence Relations In the Boolean case, positive-deﬁniteness and equivalence are synonymous, that is, a Boolean relation R : X × X → {0, 1} is positive-deﬁnite if and only if R is the indicator function of an equivalence relation ∼ that is, R(x, y) = 1 if x ∼ y and R(x, y) = 0 if x ∼ y. For a proof, see Appendix A.2. This = = =, relationship can be used to obtain an extension to fuzzy relations as given by the next theorem whose proof can be found in the Appendix A.3. Theorem 10 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, µ i : X → [0, 1], i ∈ I, I non-empty; then the fuzzy equivalence relation EM : X × X → [0, 1] given by ↔ EM (x, y) = inf T M (µi (x), µi (y)) i∈I is positive-semideﬁnite. In the following, the most prominent representatives of Archimedean t-norms, the Product TP and the Łukasiewicz t-norm TL , are used to construct positive-semideﬁnite fuzzy similarity relations. Though the ﬁrst part can also be derived from a result due to Yaglom (1957) that characterizes isotropic stationary kernels by its spectral representation, here we prefer to present a direct, elementary proof. Compare also Bochner (1955) and Genton (2001). Theorem 11 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, ν : X → [0, 1] and let h : [0, 1] → [0, 1] be an isomorphism of the unit interval that can be expanded in the manner of Equation (1), that is h(x) = ∑k ck xk with ck ≥ 0; then the fuzzy equivalence relations EL,h , EP,h : X × X → [0, 1] given by ↔ EL,h (x, y) = h T L h−1 (ν(x)) , h−1 (ν(y)) and ↔ EP,h (x, y) = h T P h−1 (ν(x)) , h−1 (ν(y)) (8) (9) are positive-semideﬁnite. Proof. To prove the positive-deﬁniteness of the two-placed functions E L,h and EP,h given by equations (8) and (9) respectively, we have to show that n n ∑ i, j=1 EL,h (xi , xi ) ci c j ≥ 0, ∑ i, j=1 EP,h (xi , x j ) ci c j ≥ 0 for any n ∈ N and any choice of x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X , respectively. According to an elementary result from Linear Algebra this is equivalent to the assertion that the determinants (1 ≤ m ≤ n) Dm = det (E(xi , x j ))i, j∈{1,...,m} of the minors of the matrix (E(xi , x j ))i, j satisfy ∀m ∈ {1, . . . , n} : Dm ≥ 0, where E denotes either EL,h or EP,h . Recall that the determinant of a matrix is invariant with respect to renaming the indices, that is, if σ : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n} is a permutation then det [(ai j )i, j ] = det (aσ(i)σ( j) )i, j . 2609 M OSER For convenience, let denote µi = h−1 (ν(xi )). Then, without loss of generality, we may assume that the values µi are ordered monotonically decreasing, that is, µi ≥ µ j for i < j. ↔ → (10) → Case TL : Note that T L (a, b) = min{ T L (a, b), T L (b, a)} = 1 − |a − b|. Then we have to show that for all dimensions n ∈ N, the determinant of E (n) = (1 − |µi − µ j |)i, j∈{1,...,n} is non-negative, that is Due to the assumption (10), we have det[E (n) ] ≥ 0. 1 − |µi − µ j | = 1 − (µi − µ j ) if i ≤ j, 1 − (µ j − µi ) else which yields   . . . 1 − (µ1 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ1 − µn )  . . . 1 − (µ2 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ2 − µn )     . . . 1 − (µ3 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ3 − µn )    (n) E = . . . .. . .   . . .   1 − (µ1 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ2 − µn−1 ) . . . 1 1 − (µn−1 − µn ) 1 − (µ1 − µn ) 1 − (µ2 − µn ) . . . 1 − (µn−1 − µn ) 1 1 − (µ1 − µ2 ) 1 1 − (µ2 − µ3 ) . . . 1 1 − (µ1 − µ2 ) 1 − (µ1 − µ3 ) . . . Now let us apply determinant-invariant elementary column operations to simplify this matrix by subtracting the column with index i − 1 from the column with index i, i ≥ 2. This yields   1 µ2 − µ1 ... µn−1 − µn−2 µn − µn−1  1 − (µ1 − µ2 ) −(µ2 − µ1 ) . . . µn−1 − µn−2 µn − µn−1     1 − (µ1 − µ3 ) −(µ2 − µ1 ) . . . µn−1 − µn−2 µn − µn−1    ˜ E (n) =  . . . . . .. . . . .   . . . . .   1 − (µ1 − µn−1 ) −(µ2 − µ1 ) . . . −(µn−2 − µn−1 ) µn − µn−1  1 − (µ1 − µn ) −(µ2 − µ1 ) . . . −(µn−2 − µn−1 ) −(µn−1 − µn ) Therefore, α = n ∏(µi−1 − µi ) ≥ 0 (11) i=2 ˜ ˆ det[E (n) ] = det[E (n) ] = α det[En ], where   . . . −1 −1  . . . −1 −1    . . . −1 −1   (n) ˆ E = . . . .. . .   . . .   1 − (µ1 − µn−1 ) +1 . . . +1 −1 1 − (µ1 − µn ) +1 . . . +1 +1 1 1 − (µ1 − µ2 ) 1 − (µ1 − µ3 ) . . . 2610 −1 +1 +1 . . . (12) G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS Let us apply Laplacian determinant expansion by minors to the ﬁrst column of matrix (12), that is n det[A] = ∑ (−1)i+ j ai j det[Ai j ] i=1 where A = (ai j ) is an n × n-matrix, j arbitrarily chosen from {1, . . . , n} and Ai j is the matrix corresponding to the cofactor ai j obtained by canceling out the i-th row and the j-th column from A (see, ˆ for example, Muir, 1960). For n = 1, we get the trivial case det[ E (1) ] = 1. Note that the ﬁrst and (n) ˆ the last rows of the matrices Ei,1 for 1 < i < n only differ by their signum, consequently the minors ˆ (n) det[Ei,1 ] for 1 < i < n, n ≥ 2, are vanishing, that is, det[Ai,1 ] = 0, for 1 < i < n. Therefore, according to the Laplacian expansion, we get (n) (n) ˆ ˆ ˆ det[E (n) ] = 1 · det[E1,1 ] + (−1)n (1 − (µ1 − µn )) · det[E1,n ]. (13) Observe that (n) ˆ det[E1,1 ] = 2n−2 (n) ˆ det[E1,n ] = (−1)n−1 2n−2 . Consequently, Equation (13) simpliﬁes to ˆ det[E (n) ] = 2n−2 1 + (−1)n (−1)n−1 2n−2 (1 − (µ1 − µn )) = 2n−2 (1 − (1 − (µ1 − µn ))) = 2n−2 (µ1 − µn ) ≥ 0 which together with (11) proves the ﬁrst case. ↔ → → Case TP : First of all, let us compute T P (a, b) = min{ T P (a, b), T L (b, a)}. Hence,  min{ b , a } if a, b > 0,  a b   0 ↔ if a = 0 and b > 0 , T P (a, b) = 0 if b = 0 and a > 0 ,    1 if a = 0 and b = 0 . Again, without loss of generality, let us suppose that the values µ i , i ∈ {1, . . . , n} are ordered monotonically decreasing, that is µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ . . . ≥ µn . Before checking the general case, let us consider the special case of vanishing µ-values. For this, let us assume for the moment that µi = > 0 if i < i0 , 0 else ↔ ↔ which implies that T P (µi , µ j ) = 0 for i < i0 and j ≥ i0 and T P (µi , µ j ) = 1 for i ≥ i0 and j ≥ i0 . This leads to a decomposition of the matrix ↔ E (n) = T P (µi , µ j ) 2611 ij M OSER such that det[E (n) ] = det[E (i0 −1) ] · det[In−i0 −1 ] where Ik denotes the k × k-matrix with constant entries 1, hence det[In−i0 −1 ] ∈ {0, 1}. Therefore, we may assume that µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ . . . ≥ µn > 0. Then we have to show that for all dimensions n ∈ N, the determinant of µi µ j , µ j µi E (n) = min i, j∈{1,...,n} is non-negative, that is det[E (n) ] ≥ 0.

By this, the determinant of the matrix in Equation (15) readily turns out to be n−1 µi+1 ˜ det[E (n) ] = det[E (n) ] = ∏ 1 − µi i=1 2 ≥0 which together with Theorem (2) ends the proof. Note that relations (8) and (9) are T -transitive with respect to the corresponding isomorphic Archimedean t-norms, TL,h (x, y) = h(TL (h−1 (x), h−1 (x))) and TP,h (x, y) = h(TP (h−1 (x), h−1 (x))), respectively. 2612 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS Corollary 12 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, µ i : X → [0, 1], λi ∈ ]0, 1] with ∑i λi = 1 ˜ ˜ where i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, n ∈ N, then the fuzzy equivalence relations EL , EP : X × X → [0, 1] given by n ↔ ˜ EL (x, y) = ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)) (16) i=1 and n ↔ ˜ EP (x, y) = ∏ T P (µi (x), µi (y)) λi (17) i=1 are TL - and TP -equivalences, respectively, and kernels. Proof. First of all, let us check the TL -transitivity of formula (16). This can readily be shown by ↔ means of the deﬁnition of TL and the TL -transitivity of T L due to the following inequalities: n TL n ↔ i=1 n n ↔ ↔ n ↔ ↔ ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)) + ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (z)) − 1 , 0 i=1 i=1 n max = i=1 i=1 n = i=1 ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)) + ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (z)) − 1, 0 max max ↔ ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)), ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (yz) n ↔ ↔ ∑ λi TL T L (µi (x), µi (y)), ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (z)) , 0 i=1 i=1 n max ↔ ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (z)), 0 ≤ ≤ = i=1 ↔ λi T L (µi (x), µi (z)). ↔ This, together with the TP -transitivity of T P , proves that the formulas given by (16) and (17) are TL and TP -equivalences, respectively. Expanding the factors of formula (17) yields  1 if µi (x) = µi (y) = 0, λi ↔ λi λi (18) T P (µi (x), µi (y)) =  min(µiλi(x),µiλi(y)) else max(µi (x),µi (y)) which by comparing case TP of the proof of Theorem 11 shows that the left-hand side of Equation (18) is positive-semideﬁnite. As the convex combination and the product are special cases of positive-semideﬁniteness preserving functions according to Theorem 1, the functions deﬁned by equations (16) and (17) prove to be again positive-semideﬁnite and, therefore, kernels. It is interesting to observe that both formulas (16) and (17) can be expressed in the form, f ( τ(x) − τ(y) 1 ), where f : I → [0, 1], I some interval, is a strictly decreasing function, τ : X → I n , I some interval, τ(x) = (τ1 (x), . . . , τn (x)) and τ(x) 1 = ∑n |τi (x)|. Indeed, for Equation (16) let us deﬁne i=1 fL : [0, 1] → [0, 1], fL (a) = 1 − a τL : X → [0, 1] , τL (x) = (λ1 µ1 (x), . . . , λn µn (x)) n 2613 M OSER and for Equation (17) and positive membership functions µ i , µi (x) > 0 for all x ∈ X , let us deﬁne fP : [0, ∞[→ [0, 1], fP (a) = e−a τP : X → ] − ∞, 1]n , τP (x) = (λ1 ln(µ1 (x)), . . . , λn ln(µn (x))) Therefore, we get ˜ EL (x, y) = 1 − τL (x) − τL (y) ˜ EP (x, y) = e− τP (x)−τP (y) 1 . 1 (19) (20) While formulas (19) and (20) provide a geometrical interpretation by means of the norm . 1 , the corresponding formulas (16) and (17) yield a semantical model of the assertion “IF x is equal to y with respect to feature µ1 AND . . . AND x is equal to y with respect to feature µn THEN x is equal to y” as aggregation of biimplications in terms of fuzzy logic. While in the former case, the aggregation has some compensatory effect, the latter is just a conjunction in terms of the Product triangular norm. For details on aggregation operators see, for example, Saminger et al. (2002) and Calvo et al. (2002). The formulas (16) and (17) coincide for the following special case. If the membership functions µi are indicator functions of sets Ai ⊆ X which form a partition of X , then the kernels (16) and (17) reduce to the indicator function characterizing the Boolean equivalence relation induced by this partition {A1 , . . . , An }. The formulas (16) and (17) for general membership functions therefore provide kernels which can be interpreted to be induced by a family of fuzzy sets and, in particular, by fuzzy partitions, that is, families of fuzzy sets fulﬁlling some criteria which extend the axioms for a Boolean partition in a many-valued logical sense. For deﬁnitions and further details on fuzzy partitions see, for ¨ example, De Baets and Mesiar (1998), Demirci (2003) and H oppner and Klawonn (2003). It is a frequently used paradigm that the decision boundaries for a classiﬁcation problem lie between clusters rather than intersecting them. Due to this cluster hypothesis, the problem of designing kernels based on fuzzy partitions is closely related to the problem of learning kernels from unlabeled data. For further details on semi-supervised learning see, for example, Seeger (2002), Chapelle et al. (2003) and T. M. Huang (2006). It is left to future research to explore this relationship to the problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data and related concepts like covariance kernels. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have presented a novel view on kernels from a fuzzy logical point of view. Particularly, the similarity-measure aspect of a kernel is addressed and investigated by means of the so-called T -transitivity which is characteristic for fuzzy equivalence relations. As a consequence, we derived that a large class of kernels can be represented in a way that is commonly used for representing fuzzy rule bases. In addition to this proof for the existence of such a representation, constructive examples are presented. It is the idea of this research to look for a combination of knowledge-based strategies with kernel-based methods in order to facilitate a more ﬂexible designing process of kernels which also allows to incorporate prior knowledge. Further research aims at 2614 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS analyzing the behavior of kernels constructed in this way when applied in the various kernel methods like support vector machines, kernel principal components analysis and others. In particular, it is intended to focus on the problem of learning kernels from unlabeled data where the fuzzy partitions are induced by appropriate clustering principles.

For sake of completeness the following sections provide proofs regarding Theorem 8, the characterization of kernels in the Boolean case and the construction of kernels by means of the minimum t-norm TM . Furthermore, in Section A.4 an example of a non-positive-semideﬁnite Tcos -equivalence is given. A.1 Proof of Theorem 8 Let us start with the analysis of 3-dimensional matrices. Lemma 13 Let M = (mi j )i j ∈ [0, 1]3×3 be a 3 × 3 symmetric matrix with mii = 1, i = 1, 2, 3; then M is positive-semideﬁnite iff for all i, j, k ∈ {1, 2, 3} there holds mi j m jk − 1 − m2j i 1 − m2 ≤ mik jk Proof. For simplicity, let a = m1,2 , b = m1,3 and c = m2,3 . Then the determinant of M, Det(M), is a function of the variables a, b, c given by D(a, b, c) = 1 + 2abc − a2 − b2 − c2 . For any choice of a, b, the quadratic equation D(a, b, c) = 0 can be solved for c, yielding two solutions c1 = c1 (a, b) and c2 = c2 (a, b) as functions of a and b, c1 (a, b) = ab − c2 (a, b) = ab + 1 − a2 1 − a2 1 − b2 1 − b2 . Obviously, for all |a| ≤ 1 and |b| ≤ 1, the values c1 (a, b) and c2 (a, b) are real. By substituting a = cos α and b = cos(β) with α, β ∈ [0, π ], it becomes readily clear that 2 c1 (a, b) = c1 (cos(α), cos(β)) = cos(α) cos(β) − sin(α) sin(β) = cos(α + β) ∈ [−1, 1] 2615 M OSER and, analogously, c2 (a, b) = c2 (cos(α), cos(β)) = cos(α) cos(β) + sin(α) sin(β) = cos(α − β) ∈ [−1, 1]. As for all a, b ∈ [−1, 1] the determinant function Da,b (c) := D(a, b, c) is quadratic in c with negative coefﬁcient for c2 , there is a uniquely determined maximum at c0 (a, b) = ab. Note that for all a, b ∈ [−1, 1], we have c1 (a, b) ≤ c0 (a, b) ≤ c2 (a, b) and D(a, b, c0 (a, b)) = 1 + 2ab(ab) − a2 − b2 − (ab)2 = (1 − a2 )(1 − b2 ) ≥ 0. Therefore, D(a, b, c) ≥ 0 if and only if c ∈ [c1 (a, b), c2 (a, b)]. Recall from linear algebra that by renaming the indices, the determinant does not change. Therefore, without loss of generality, we may assume that a ≥ b ≥ c. For convenience, let Q = {(x, y, z) ∈ [0, 1]3 |x ≥ y ≥ z}. Then, obviously, for any choice of a, b ∈ [0, 1] there holds (a, b, c1 (a, b)) ∈ Q. Elementary algebra shows that (a, b, c2 (a, b)) ∈ Q is only the case for a = b = 1. As for a = b = 1 the two solutions c1 , c2 coincide, that is, c1 (1, 1) = c2 (1, 1) = 1, it follows that for any choice of (a, b, c) ∈ Q, there holds D(a, b, c) ≥ 0 if and only if c1 (a, b) = ab − 1 − a2 1 − b2 ≤ c. (21) If (a, b, c) ∈ Q, then the inequality (21) is trivially satisﬁed which together with (21) proves the lemma Now Theorem 8 immediately follows from Deﬁnition (1), Lemma (13) and the characterizing inequality (21). A.2 Characterization of Kernels in the Boolean Case ¨ The following lemma and proposition can also be found as an exercise in Sch olkopf and Smola (2002). Lemma 14 Let ∼ be an equivalence relation on X and let k : X × X → {0, 1} be induced by ∼ via k(x, y) = 1 if and only if x ∼ y; then k is a kernel. Proof. By deﬁnition of positive-deﬁniteness, let us consider an arbitrary sequence of elements x1 , . . . , xn . Then there are at most n equivalence classes Q1 , . . . , Qm on the set of indices {1, . . . , n}, S / m ≤ n, where i=1,...,m Qi = {1, . . . , n} and Qi ∩ Q j = 0 for i = j. Note that k(xi , x j ) = 0 if the indices 2616 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS i, j belong to different equivalence classes. Then, for any choice of reals c 1 , . . . , cn , we obtain ∑ ci c j k(xi , x j ) m = i, j ∑ ∑ ci c j k(xi , x j ) p=1 i, j∈Q p m = ∑ ∑ p=1 i, j∈Q p ci c j · 1 2 m = ∑ ∑ ci p=1 i∈Q p ≥ 0 Proposition 15 k : X × X → {0, 1} with k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X is a kernel if and only if it is induced by an equivalence relation. Proof. It only remains to be shown that if k is a kernel, then it is the indicator function of an equivalence relation, that is, it is induced by an equivalence relation. If k is a kernel, according to Lemma 13, for all x, y, z ∈ X , it has to satisfy Tcos (k(x, y), k(y, z)) ≤ k(x, z), which implies, k(x, y) = 1, k(y, z) = 1 =⇒ k(x, z) = 1. Obviously, we have k(x, x) = 1 and k(x, y) = k(y, x) due to the reﬂexivity and symmetry assumption of k, respectively. A.3 Constructing Kernels by TM For convenience let us recall the basic notion of an α-cut from fuzzy set theory: Deﬁnition 16 Let X be a non-empty set and µ : X → [0, 1]; then [µ]α = {x ∈ X | µ(x) ≥ α} is called the α-cut of the membership function µ. Lemma 17 k : X × X → [0, 1] is a TM -equivalence if and only if all α-cuts of k are Boolean equivalence relations. Proof. (i) Let us assume that k is a TM -equivalence. Let α ∈ [0, 1], then by deﬁnition, [k]α = {(x, y) ∈ X × X | k(x, y) ≥ α}. In order to show that [k]α is a Boolean equivalence, the axioms for reﬂexivity, symmetry and transitivity have to be shown. Reﬂexivity and symmetry are trivially satisﬁed as for all x, y ∈ X , there holds by assumption that k(x, x) = 1 and k(x, y) = k(y, x). In order to show transitivity, let us consider (x, y), (y, z) ∈ [k]α , that means k(x, y) ≥ α and k(y, z) ≥ α; then by the TM -transitivity assumption it follows that α ≤ min(k(x, y), k(y, z)) ≤ k(x, z), hence (x, z) ∈ [k]α . 2617 M OSER (ii) Suppose now that all α-cuts of k are Boolean equivalence relations. Then, in particular, [k] α with α = 1 is reﬂexive, hence k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X . The symmetry of k follows from the fact that for all α ∈ [0, 1] and pairs (x, y) ∈ [k]α , by assumption, we have (y, x) ∈ [k]α . In order to show the TM -transitivity property, let us consider arbitrarily chosen elements x, y, z ∈ X . Let α = min(k(x, y), k(y, z)); then by the transitivity assumption of [k] α , it follows that (x, z) ∈ [k]α , consequently k(x, z) ≥ α = min(k(x, y), k(y, z)). Proposition 18 If k : X × X → [0, 1] is a TM -equivalence then it is positive-semideﬁnite. Proof. Choose arbitrary elements x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X and consider the set of values which are taken by all combinations k(xi , x j ), i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} and order them increasingly, that is k(xi , x j )| i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}} = {α1 , . . . , αm , where 0 ≤ α1 ≤ · · · αm ≤ 1. Observe that for all pairs (xi , x j ), i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} there holds m k(xi , x j ) = ∑ (αv − αv−1 )1[k] αv v=2 (xi , x j ) + α1 1[k]α1 (xi , x j ) showing that on the set {x1 , . . . , xn } × {x1 , . . . , xn }, the function k is a linear combination of indicator functions of Boolean equivalences (which are positive-semideﬁnite by Proposition 15) with nonnegative coefﬁcients and, consequently, it has to be positive semideﬁnite. A.4 Example of a Non-Positive-Semideﬁnite Tcos -Equivalence For dimensions n > 3, the Tcos -transitivity is no longer sufﬁcient to guarantee positive semi(n) deﬁniteness. Consider, for example An = (ai j )i j where  λ  (n) ai j = 1   0 if min(i, j) = 1, max(i, j) > 1 , if i = j, else . (22) √ (n) (n) (n) Choose λ = 1/ 2, then Tcos (λ, λ) = 0, hence we have Tcos (ai j , a jk ) ≤ aik for all indices i, j, k ∈ 1, . . . , n. As det(An ) < 0 for n > 3, the matrix An cannot be positive-semideﬁnite though the Tcos transitivity conditions are satisﬁed. References S. Bochner. Harmonic Analysis and the Theory of Probability.

<p>Author: Don Hush, Patrick Kelly, Clint Scovel, Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: We describe polynomial–time algorithms that produce approximate solutions with guaranteed accuracy for a class of QP problems that are used in the design of support vector machine classiﬁers. These algorithms employ a two–stage process where the ﬁrst stage produces an approximate solution to a dual QP problem and the second stage maps this approximate dual solution to an approximate primal solution. For the second stage we describe an O(n log n) algorithm that maps an √ √ approximate dual solution with accuracy (2 2Kn + 8 λ)−2 λε2 to an approximate primal solution p with accuracy ε p where n is the number of data samples, Kn is the maximum kernel value over the data and λ > 0 is the SVM regularization parameter. For the ﬁrst stage we present new results for decomposition algorithms and describe new decomposition algorithms with guaranteed accuracy and run time. In particular, for τ–rate certifying decomposition algorithms we establish the optimality of τ = 1/(n − 1). In addition we extend the recent τ = 1/(n − 1) algorithm of Simon (2004) to form two new composite algorithms that also achieve the τ = 1/(n − 1) iteration bound of List and Simon (2005), but yield faster run times in practice. We also exploit the τ–rate certifying property of these algorithms to produce new stopping rules that are computationally efﬁcient and that guarantee a speciﬁed accuracy for the approximate dual solution. Furthermore, for the dual QP problem corresponding to the standard classiﬁcation problem we describe operational conditions for which the Simon and composite algorithms possess an upper bound of O(n) on the number of iterations. For this same problem we also describe general conditions for which a matching lower bound exists for any decomposition algorithm that uses working sets of size 2. For the Simon and composite algorithms we also establish an O(n2 ) bound on the overall run time for the ﬁrst stage. Combining the ﬁrst and second stages gives an overall run time of O(n2 (c</p><p>6 0.17369059 <a title="13-lsi-6" href="./jmlr-2006-Using_Machine_Learning_to_Guide_Architecture_Simulation.html">94 jmlr-2006-Using Machine Learning to Guide Architecture Simulation</a></p>

<p>Author: Fu Chang, Chin-Chin Lin, Chi-Jen Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a number of adaptive prototype learning (APL) algorithms. They employ the same algorithmic scheme to determine the number and location of prototypes, but differ in the use of samples or the weighted averages of samples as prototypes, and also in the assumption of distance measures. To understand these algorithms from a theoretical viewpoint, we address their convergence properties, as well as their consistency under certain conditions. We also present a soft version of APL, in which a non-zero training error is allowed in order to enhance the generalization power of the resultant classifier. Applying the proposed algorithms to twelve UCI benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that they outperform many instance-based learning algorithms, the k-nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machines in terms of average test accuracy.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: In this work we consider the task of relaxing the i.i.d. assumption in pattern recognition (or classiﬁcation), aiming to make existing learning algorithms applicable to a wider range of tasks. Pattern recognition is guessing a discrete label of some object based on a set of given examples (pairs of objects and labels). We consider the case of deterministically deﬁned labels. Traditionally, this task is studied under the assumption that examples are independent and identically distributed. However, it turns out that many results of pattern recognition theory carry over a weaker assumption. Namely, under the assumption of conditional independence and identical distribution of objects, while the only assumption on the distribution of labels is that the rate of occurrence of each label should be above some positive threshold. We ﬁnd a broad class of learning algorithms for which estimations of the probability of the classiﬁcation error achieved under the classical i.i.d. assumption can be generalized to the similar estimates for case of conditionally i.i.d. examples.</p><p>3 0.27143446 <a title="13-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2006-Step_Size_Adaptation_in_Reproducing_Kernel_Hilbert_Space.html">86 jmlr-2006-Step Size Adaptation in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space</a></p>
<p>Author: S. V. N. Vishwanathan, Nicol N. Schraudolph, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an online support vector machine (SVM) that uses the stochastic meta-descent (SMD) algorithm to adapt its step size automatically. We formulate the online learning problem as a stochastic gradient descent in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and translate SMD to the nonparametric setting, where its gradient trace parameter is no longer a coefﬁcient vector but an element of the RKHS. We derive efﬁcient updates that allow us to perform the step size adaptation in linear time. We apply the online SVM framework to a variety of loss functions, and in particular show how to handle structured output spaces and achieve efﬁcient online multiclass classiﬁcation. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms more primitive methods for setting the gradient step size.

<p>Author: Clayton D. Scott, Robert D. Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Given a probability measure P and a reference measure µ, one is often interested in the minimum µ-measure set with P-measure at least α. Minimum volume sets of this type summarize the regions of greatest probability mass of P, and are useful for detecting anomalies and constructing conﬁdence regions. This paper addresses the problem of estimating minimum volume sets based on independent samples distributed according to P. Other than these samples, no other information is available regarding P, but the reference measure µ is assumed to be known. We introduce rules for estimating minimum volume sets that parallel the empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization principles in classiﬁcation. As in classiﬁcation, we show that the performances of our estimators are controlled by the rate of uniform convergence of empirical to true probabilities over the class from which the estimator is drawn. Thus we obtain ﬁnite sample size performance bounds in terms of VC dimension and related quantities. We also demonstrate strong universal consistency, an oracle inequality, and rates of convergence. The proposed estimators are illustrated with histogram and decision tree set estimation rules.

<p>Author: Adam R. Klivans, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We consider two well-studied problems regarding attribute efﬁcient learning: learning decision lists and learning parity functions. First, we give an algorithm for learning decision lists of length ˜ 1/3 ˜ 1/3 k over n variables using 2O(k ) log n examples and time nO(k ) . This is the ﬁrst algorithm for learning decision lists that has both subexponential sample complexity and subexponential running time in the relevant parameters. Our approach establishes a relationship between attribute efﬁcient learning and polynomial threshold functions and is based on a new construction of low degree, low weight polynomial threshold functions for decision lists. For a wide range of parameters our construction matches a lower bound due to Beigel for decision lists and gives an essentially optimal tradeoff between polynomial threshold function degree and weight. Second, we give an algorithm for learning an unknown parity function on k out of n variables using O(n1−1/k ) examples in poly(n) time. For k = o(log n) this yields a polynomial time algorithm with sample complexity o(n); this is the ﬁrst polynomial time algorithm for learning parity on a superconstant number of variables with sublinear sample complexity. We also give a simple algorithm for learning an unknown length-k parity using O(k log n) examples in nk/2 time, which improves on the naive nk time bound of exhaustive search.

<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2006-13-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume7/chang06a/chang06a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Fu Chang, Chin-Chin Lin, Chi-Jen Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a number of adaptive prototype learning (APL) algorithms. They employ the same algorithmic scheme to determine the number and location of prototypes, but differ in the use of samples or the weighted averages of samples as prototypes, and also in the assumption of distance measures. To understand these algorithms from a theoretical viewpoint, we address their convergence properties, as well as their consistency under certain conditions. We also present a soft version of APL, in which a non-zero training error is allowed in order to enhance the generalization power of the resultant classifier. Applying the proposed algorithms to twelve UCI benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that they outperform many instance-based learning algorithms, the k-nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machines in terms of average test accuracy.

[sent-18, score-1.126]
</p><p>2 The simplest way is to use all training samples as prototypes (Fix and Hodges, 1951, 1952, 1991a, 1991b). [sent-20, score-0.633]
</p><p>3 ©2006 Fu Chang, Chin-Chin Lin and Chi-Jen Lu  CHANG, LIN AND LU  First, for a finite set of training samples S, the error rate using all samples as prototypes does not exceed twice the Bayes risk (Cover and Hart, 1967). [sent-22, score-0.724]
</p><p>4 However, recruiting all training samples as prototypes can incur a high computational cost during the test procedure, which is prohibitive in applications with large corpora. [sent-25, score-0.633]
</p><p>5 These algorithms execute a process iteratively to check the satisfaction of certain criteria for the current set of prototypes, and add or drop prototypes until a stop condition is met. [sent-28, score-0.529]
</p><p>6 Another method for finding prototypes can be categorized as cluster-based learning (CBL) algorithms, in which prototypes are not samples per se, but can be derived as the weighted averages of samples. [sent-33, score-1.146]
</p><p>7 Instead of representing prototypes as the weighted averages of samples, they can be represented as centroids of clusters (Devi and Murty, 2002), or as hyperrectangles (high-dimensional rectangles) (Salzberg, 1991). [sent-37, score-0.552]
</p><p>8 The conditions stipulate that: (a) the algorithm should minimize the empirical error, which is the error in classifying training samples; and (b) the number of prototypes should grow as a lower order of the number of training samples. [sent-41, score-0.607]
</p><p>9 The consistency of CNN derives from the fact that its prototypes are samples and thus always keep a certain distance from each other. [sent-57, score-0.67]
</p><p>10 Fortunately, this flexibility also exists in adaptive prototype learning (APL) algorithms, and can be derived by a tradeoff between the number of prototypes and their predictive power. [sent-66, score-0.881]
</p><p>11 The first is an instancebased algorithm, which adds samples as prototypes according to an enhanced absorption criterion. [sent-71, score-0.672]
</p><p>12 2) is that it achieves substantially higher test accuracy at a relatively low training cost, compared to other instance-based algorithms, whose major merit is a lower ratio of prototypes to training samples. [sent-73, score-0.657]
</p><p>13 Although our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy at the expense of a somewhat higher ratio of prototypes to training samples, we believe this is acceptable, since it enables the proposed classifier to even outperform the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) rule in terms of accuracy. [sent-74, score-0.723]
</p><p>14 The second approach is a hybrid method that constructs prototypes as either samples or the weighted averages of samples. [sent-75, score-0.617]
</p><p>15 A prototype data pair (p, y) consists of a prototype p ∈ R d and its label y. [sent-127, score-0.632]
</p><p>16 We say that a classifier uses the 1-NN rule based on prototype data pairs if g assigns to each x ∈ R d the label of the nearest prototype to x. [sent-128, score-0.755]
</p><p>17 The collection of all multiclass classifiers using the1-NN rule based on k prototype data pairs is denoted by C(k), while the collection of binary classifiers using the 1-NN rule based on k prototype data pairs is denoted by B(k). [sent-129, score-0.852]
</p><p>18 A prototype classification rule, on the other hand, is a sequence {gn} such that gn uses the 1-NN rule based on kn prototypes for some kn. [sent-145, score-0.938]
</p><p>19 The following corollary provides a sufficient condition for the consistency of a prototype classification rule. [sent-146, score-0.444]
</p><p>20 Members of Un are called prototypes, and samples whose labels match those of their nearest prototypes are said to be absorbed. [sent-159, score-0.662]
</p><p>21 The algorithm scans Xn as many times as necessary, until all members of Xn have been absorbed or, equivalently, no more prototypes can be added to Un. [sent-163, score-0.585]
</p><p>22 Lemma 8 Under the conditions of boundedness and non-zero separation, the number of CNN prototypes cannot exceed (2 R / δ + 1) d , where R is the radius of H and δ is the limit of {δ n } . [sent-169, score-0.618]
</p><p>23 Proof: We want to prove that all prototypes are δ-separated, that is, their distance is at least δ. [sent-170, score-0.557]
</p><p>24 This is true for any two prototypes with different labels, since all prototypes are samples and heterogeneous samples are δ -separated. [sent-171, score-1.32]
</p><p>25 Therefore, we only have to prove that all prototypes of the same label are also δ -separated. [sent-172, score-0.529]
</p><p>26 We assume that p and q are prototypes of the same label. [sent-173, score-0.529]
</p><p>27 As CNN is a sequential process, its prototypes are constructed in linear order. [sent-174, score-0.529]
</p><p>28 Theorem 9 Let {gn} be a sequence of classifiers using the 1-NN rule based on CNN prototype data pairs. [sent-186, score-0.409]
</p><p>29 4  Adaptive Prototype Learning Algorithms  An adaptive prototype learning algorithm is similar to CNN in that it adds as many prototypes as necessary until all samples have been absorbed. [sent-188, score-0.946]
</p><p>30 In CNN, all prototypes are samples, whereas prototypes in APL can be samples or the weighted averages of samples. [sent-190, score-1.146]
</p><p>31 We denote prototypes that are samples as instance-based prototypes (IBPs) to differentiate them from cluster-based prototypes (CBPs), which are the weighted averages of samples. [sent-191, score-1.675]
</p><p>32 According to CNN, a sample x is absorbed if || x − q || − || x − p || > 0 ,  (1)  where p and q are prototypes, p is the nearest homogeneous prototype to x, and q is the nearest heterogeneous prototype to x. [sent-198, score-0.987]
</p><p>33 G3 Prototype Augmentation: For each y, if any unabsorbed y-samples exist, select one as a new y-prototype; otherwise, no new prototype is added to label y. [sent-208, score-0.41]
</p><p>34 (a) For each prototype p, no heterogeneous sample can be found in B (p,δ n) . [sent-217, score-0.448]
</p><p>35 (b) For any two heterogeneous prototypes p and q, || p − q || ≥ δ n . [sent-218, score-0.661]
</p><p>36 (c) For any two homogeneous prototypes m and n, || m − n || > (1 − ρ )δ n . [sent-219, score-0.56]
</p><p>37 Proof: Propositions (a) and (b) follow from the fact that GCNN prototypes are samples and the separation between any two heterogeneous samples is at least δ n . [sent-220, score-0.83]
</p><p>38 To prove (c), let two homogeneous prototypes m and n be given, and let m be constructed before n. [sent-221, score-0.56]
</p><p>39 Since n is not absorbed by the time it is taken as a prototype, there exists a heterogeneous prototype q such that || n − q || − || n − m || ≤ ρδ n or, equivalently,  || n − m || ≥ || n − q || − ρδ n . [sent-222, score-0.504]
</p><p>40 2132  ADAPTIVE PROTOTYPE LEARNING ALGORITHMS  Lemma 11 The number of GCNN prototypes cannot exceed [(2 Rn + δ n ) /(1 − ρ )δ n ]d . [sent-229, score-0.555]
</p><p>41 Proof: Lemma 10 ensures that homogeneous and heterogeneous GCNN prototypes are separated by certain constants. [sent-231, score-0.692]
</p><p>42 Using this fact and a similar argument to that in the proof of Lemma 8, we conclude that the number of GCNN prototypes cannot exceed [(2 R + δ n ) /(1 − ρ )δ n ]d . [sent-232, score-0.555]
</p><p>43  Now, under the conditions of boundedness and non-zero separation, we can also show that the number of GCNN prototypes is bounded from above by [(2 R + δ n ) /(1 − ρ )δ n ]d , with R  replacing Rn . [sent-234, score-0.561]
</p><p>44 Since [(2 R + δ n ) /(1 − ρ )δ n ]d ≤ [(2 R + δ ) /(1 − ρ )δ ]d , the number of GCNN prototypes is bounded from above by a constant independent of n. [sent-235, score-0.529]
</p><p>45 (C1) For each prototype p, no heterogeneous sample exists in B(p, fδ n ) . [sent-252, score-0.448]
</p><p>46 (C2) For any two heterogeneous prototypes p and q, || p − q || ≥ fδ n . [sent-253, score-0.661]
</p><p>47 (C3) For any two homogeneous prototypes m and n, || m − n || > (1 − ρ ) fδ n . [sent-254, score-0.56]
</p><p>48 We now state the LAPL algorithm, and prove that the prototypes derived from it satisfy (C1), (C2), and (C3). [sent-256, score-0.555]
</p><p>49 If this prototype does not satisfy (C1), (C2), and (C3), we apply the prototype adjustment module (described later in this section). [sent-259, score-0.738]
</p><p>50 If these prototypes do not satisfy (C1), (C2), and (C3), we apply the prototype adjustment module (described later in this section). [sent-267, score-0.951]
</p><p>51 Using the Lagrangian method, we can derive the following equations:  uij  (1 / || c − x ||) = ∑ (1 / || c − x ||) i  p k =1  2 m −1  j  k  2 m −1  j  m ∑ j =1 uij x j ci = n m ∑ j =1 uij  ,  (9)  n  ,  (10)  for i = 1, 2, …, p, and j = 1, 2, …, n respectively. [sent-291, score-0.41]
</p><p>52 p  The prototype adjustment module is used to adjust the location of prototypes if they do not satisfy the separation conditions (C1), (C2), and (C3). [sent-295, score-0.99]
</p><p>53 The purpose of this module is to replace prototypes that violate (C1) or (C2) with those that do not. [sent-297, score-0.573]
</p><p>54 We now prove that after these two steps, all prototypes satisfy (C1) and (C2). [sent-304, score-0.555]
</p><p>55 We first prove that, after Step 1, all prototypes satisfy (C1). [sent-305, score-0.555]
</p><p>56 We now prove that, after Step 2, all prototypes satisfy both (C1) and (C2). [sent-308, score-0.555]
</p><p>57 It is clear that all prototypes satisfy (C1) at the end of this step; and each CBP maintains fδ n -separations from other prototypes by assumption. [sent-309, score-1.084]
</p><p>58 Step I: A set of prototypes of the same label is called a pack. [sent-313, score-0.529]
</p><p>59 Step II: Two packs are said to be fδ n -separated if any two prototypes drawn from them are fδ n -separated. [sent-316, score-0.568]
</p><p>60 When we find two packs that are not fδ n -separated, we replace one of them with the set of seeds from which its prototypes were derived. [sent-317, score-0.615]
</p><p>61 We now show that, after Step I, all prototypes satisfy (C1) and (C3). [sent-319, score-0.555]
</p><p>62 We conclude that all the prototypes satisfy (C1) and (C3). [sent-326, score-0.555]
</p><p>63 We now prove that, after Step II, all prototypes satisfy (C1), (C2), and (C3). [sent-327, score-0.555]
</p><p>64 It is clear that all prototypes satisfy (C1) and (C3) at the end of this step. [sent-328, score-0.555]
</p><p>65 It remains to prove that they also satisfy (C2), that is, heterogeneous prototypes are fδ n -separated. [sent-329, score-0.687]
</p><p>66 We want to show that all heterogeneous prototypes in the R-packs are fδ n -separated. [sent-330, score-0.661]
</p><p>67 As noted earlier, these prototypes consist of X-prototypes and U-prototypes. [sent-331, score-0.529]
</p><p>68 Thus, at the end of Step II, all prototypes satisfy (C2). [sent-335, score-0.555]
</p><p>69 The fδ n -separation between heterogeneous prototypes and the (1 − ρ ) fδ n -separation between homogeneous prototypes imply the convergence of LAPL and also its consistency under the  2135  CHANG, LIN AND LU  conditions of boundedness and non-zero separation. [sent-336, score-1.301]
</p><p>70 Let {gn} be a sequence of classifiers using the 1-NN rule based on LAPL prototype data pairs. [sent-340, score-0.409]
</p><p>71 In a kernelized adaptive prototype learning algorithm, the goal is to build prototypes in H. [sent-343, score-0.942]
</p><p>72 When either KM or FCM is used to compute prototypes, each j j prototype in H is of the form m m c i = ∑ j =1 uij Φ (x j ) / ∑ j =1 uij , n  n  where ci and uij were introduced in (6), (7), and (8). [sent-345, score-0.726]
</p><p>73 Since we do not want to express the prototypes explicitly, we use {uij }ip, ,jn=1 to represent them instead. [sent-355, score-0.529]
</p><p>74 Second, we apply the prototype adjustment module in KAPL to separate prototypes. [sent-367, score-0.396]
</p><p>75 To ensure the convergence of KAPL, we modify the prototype adjustment module as follows. [sent-369, score-0.396]
</p><p>76 However, prior to these operations we check if each prototype in a pack has a non-empty domain of attraction (DOA), where the DOA of a y-prototype p is the set of all y-samples Φ(x) for which p is the nearest prototype. [sent-371, score-0.417]
</p><p>77 Recall that we employ a clustering algorithm to create a pack of prototypes, using an unabsorbed sample Φ (u) and some other prototypes as seeds. [sent-372, score-0.681]
</p><p>78 If any prototype in a pack has an empty DOA, we replace that pack with the pack of prototypes constructed earlier. [sent-373, score-0.944]
</p><p>79 If all samples are absorbed at the end of i, the proof is complete; otherwise, more prototypes will be created, all with non-empty DOAs. [sent-379, score-0.65]
</p><p>80  Note that if we treat futile samples in LAPL in the same way, we can prove the convergence of LAPL in the setting where there is no guarantee of prototype separation. [sent-381, score-0.42]
</p><p>81 6  Soft Adaptive Prototype Learning Algorithms  The versions of APL proposed thus far are designed to continue constructing prototypes until all training samples are absorbed or, equivalently, the training error declines to zero. [sent-383, score-0.728]
</p><p>82 When a combination of parameter values Q is given, we build prototypes on K-1 folds of data, which serves as the training data, and measure the test accuracy on the remaining fold of data, which serves as the validation data. [sent-396, score-0.62]
</p><p>83 Given a set of training data and a set of validation data and assuming that the latter is the kth fold of the data, k = 1, 2, …, K, we construct prototypes and record the following information. [sent-398, score-0.568]
</p><p>84 We also compute the validation accuracy rate v k (e, Q) for all the prototypes obtained at the end of iteration n k (e, Q) . [sent-400, score-0.555]
</p><p>85 e  Note that once we have constructed prototypes to achieve a training error e1, we do not need to start from the scratch to obtain a lower training error e2. [sent-403, score-0.607]
</p><p>86 Instead, we continue to construct more prototypes until e2 is reached. [sent-404, score-0.529]
</p><p>87 First, the cluster-based approach has higher generalization power than the instancebased approach, since it picks the weighted averages of samples as prototypes and they are relatively immune to noise. [sent-613, score-0.617]
</p><p>88 Within each iteration, checking the absorption criterion takes no more than n2 steps, and clustering takes no more than 30×n2 steps (if cluster-based prototypes are required), where 30 is the maximum number of iterations allowed in a clustering algorithm. [sent-624, score-0.657]
</p><p>89 We were curious to know how the parameters’ values affect the prototypes built in the training process, so we studied the training of f-LAPL on the 12 data sets. [sent-628, score-0.607]
</p><p>90 The absorption criterion requires that a training sample should be closer to its nearest homogeneous prototype than to its heterogeneous prototype by at least fρδ n . [sent-630, score-0.98]
</p><p>91 If we raise the value of f, we increase the likelihood of a sample becoming unabsorbed so that more prototypes would have to be built. [sent-631, score-0.623]
</p><p>92 By raising the value of ρ , we also make the absorption criterion more difficult to satisfy and therefore increase the number of prototypes that need to be built. [sent-634, score-0.633]
</p><p>93 Moreover, in measuring the test accuracy, we use the top-k nearest prototypes with k being determined in the cross-validation (cf. [sent-689, score-0.597]
</p><p>94 On the other hand, the incremental methods build more prototypes than the decremental methods. [sent-695, score-0.581]
</p><p>95 Among the incremental methods, GCNN achieves a higher accuracy rate than the other two methods, at the expense of building more prototypes and a higher training cost. [sent-696, score-0.64]
</p><p>96 and yields higher accuracy and generates fewer prototypes than CNN. [sent-1032, score-0.555]
</p><p>97 Both GCNN and pGCNN generate fewer prototypes than CNN, because their training error rate e can be non-zero, while it is fixed at zero for CNN. [sent-1033, score-0.599]
</p><p>98 For k-NN, the optimal value of k is determined during cross-validation, in much the same way that we optimize the k nearest prototypes for use in the voting procedure to determine the label of a test sample (cf. [sent-1048, score-0.597]
</p><p>99 For APLs, on the other hand, we construct prototypes for all class types simultaneously. [sent-1059, score-0.529]
</p><p>100 8  Conclusion  We have proposed a number of adaptive prototype learning algorithms that construct prototypes out of training samples. [sent-1066, score-0.92]

<p>Author: Fu Chang, Chin-Chin Lin, Chi-Jen Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a number of adaptive prototype learning (APL) algorithms. They employ the same algorithmic scheme to determine the number and location of prototypes, but differ in the use of samples or the weighted averages of samples as prototypes, and also in the assumption of distance measures. To understand these algorithms from a theoretical viewpoint, we address their convergence properties, as well as their consistency under certain conditions. We also present a soft version of APL, in which a non-zero training error is allowed in order to enhance the generalization power of the resultant classifier. Applying the proposed algorithms to twelve UCI benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that they outperform many instance-based learning algorithms, the k-nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machines in terms of average test accuracy.

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun</p><p>Abstract: The eigenvalues of the kernel matrix play an important role in a number of kernel methods, in particular, in kernel principal component analysis. It is well known that the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix converge as the number of samples tends to inﬁnity. We derive probabilistic ﬁnite sample size bounds on the approximation error of individual eigenvalues which have the important property that the bounds scale with the eigenvalue under consideration, reﬂecting the actual behavior of the approximation errors as predicted by asymptotic results and observed in numerical simulations. Such scaling bounds have so far only been known for tail sums of eigenvalues. Asymptotically, the bounds presented here have a slower than stochastic rate, but the number of sample points necessary to make this disadvantage noticeable is often unrealistically large. Therefore, under practical conditions, and for all but the largest few eigenvalues, the bounds presented here form a signiﬁcant improvement over existing non-scaling bounds.

In simulations, we show that in terms of signal-to-error ratio, the sources are inferred more accurately as a result of the inclusion of strong prior knowledge. We explore different schemes of maximum-likelihood optimization for the purpose of learning the model parameters. The Expectation Maximization algorithm, which is often considered the standard optimization method in this context, results in slow convergence when the noise variance is small. In such scenarios, quasi-Newton optimization yields substantial improvements in a range of signal to noise ratios. We analyze the performance of the methods on convolutive mixtures of speech signals.

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering refers to a class of techniques which rely on the eigenstructure of a similarity matrix to partition points into disjoint clusters, with points in the same cluster having high similarity and points in different clusters having low similarity. In this paper, we derive new cost functions for spectral clustering based on measures of error between a given partition and a solution of the spectral relaxation of a minimum normalized cut problem. Minimizing these cost functions with respect to the partition leads to new spectral clustering algorithms. Minimizing with respect to the similarity matrix leads to algorithms for learning the similarity matrix from fully labelled data sets. We apply our learning algorithm to the blind one-microphone speech separation problem, casting the problem as one of segmentation of the spectrogram.

<p>Author: Ting Liu, Andrew W. Moore, Alexander Gray</p><p>Abstract: This paper is about non-approximate acceleration of high-dimensional nonparametric operations such as k nearest neighbor classiﬁers. We attempt to exploit the fact that even if we want exact answers to nonparametric queries, we usually do not need to explicitly ﬁnd the data points close to the query, but merely need to answer questions about the properties of that set of data points. This offers a small amount of computational leeway, and we investigate how much that leeway can be exploited. This is applicable to many algorithms in nonparametric statistics, memory-based learning and kernel-based learning. But for clarity, this paper concentrates on pure k-NN classiﬁcation. We introduce new ball-tree algorithms that on real-world data sets give accelerations from 2-fold to 100-fold compared against highly optimized traditional ball-tree-based k-NN . These results include data sets with up to 106 dimensions and 105 records, and demonstrate non-trivial speed-ups while giving exact answers. keywords: ball-tree, k-NN classiﬁcation</p><p>6 0.038508806 <a title="13-tfidf-6" href="./jmlr-2006-Statistical_Comparisons_of_Classifiers_over_Multiple_Data_Sets.html">85 jmlr-2006-Statistical Comparisons of Classifiers over Multiple Data Sets</a></p>

<p>Author: Fu Chang, Chin-Chin Lin, Chi-Jen Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a number of adaptive prototype learning (APL) algorithms. They employ the same algorithmic scheme to determine the number and location of prototypes, but differ in the use of samples or the weighted averages of samples as prototypes, and also in the assumption of distance measures. To understand these algorithms from a theoretical viewpoint, we address their convergence properties, as well as their consistency under certain conditions. We also present a soft version of APL, in which a non-zero training error is allowed in order to enhance the generalization power of the resultant classifier. Applying the proposed algorithms to twelve UCI benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that they outperform many instance-based learning algorithms, the k-nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machines in terms of average test accuracy.

<p>Author: Janez Demšar</p><p>Abstract: While methods for comparing two learning algorithms on a single data set have been scrutinized for quite some time already, the issue of statistical tests for comparisons of more algorithms on multiple data sets, which is even more essential to typical machine learning studies, has been all but ignored. This article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classiﬁers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classiﬁers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classiﬁers over multiple data sets. Results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD (critical difference) diagrams.

<p>Author: Bernhard Moser</p><p>Abstract: Kernels are two-placed functions that can be interpreted as inner products in some Hilbert space. It is this property which makes kernels predestinated to carry linear models of learning, optimization or classiﬁcation strategies over to non-linear variants. Following this idea, various kernel-based methods like support vector machines or kernel principal component analysis have been conceived which prove to be successful for machine learning, data mining and computer vision applications. When applying a kernel-based method a central question is the choice and the design of the kernel function. This paper provides a novel view on kernels based on fuzzy-logical concepts which allows to incorporate prior knowledge in the design process. It is demonstrated that kernels mapping to the unit interval with constant one in its diagonal can be represented by a commonly used fuzzylogical formula for representing fuzzy rule bases. This means that a great class of kernels can be represented by fuzzy-logical concepts. Apart from this result, which only guarantees the existence of such a representation, constructive examples are presented and the relation to unlabeled learning is pointed out. Keywords: kernel, triangular norm, T -transitivity, fuzzy relation, residuum 1. Motivation Positive-deﬁniteness plays a prominent role especially in optimization and machine learning due to the fact that two-place functions with this property, so-called kernels, can be represented as inner products in some Hilbert space. Thereby, optimization techniques conceived on the basis of linear models can be extended to non-linear algorithms. For a survey of applications see, for example, ¨ Jolliffe (1986), Sch¨ lkopf and Smola (2002) and Scholkopf et al. (1998). o Recently in Moser (2006) it was shown that kernels with values from the unit interval can be interpreted as fuzzy equivalence relations motivated by the idea that kernels express a kind of similarity. This means that the concept of fuzzy equivalence relations, or synonymously fuzzy similarity relations, is more general than that of kernels, provided only values in the unit interval are considered. Fuzzy equivalence relations distinguish from Boolean equivalence relations by a many-valued extension of transitivity which can be interpreted as many-valued logical model of the statement “IF x is similar to y AND y is similar to z THEN x is similar to z”. In contrast to the Boolean case, in many-valued logics the set of truth values is extended such that also assertions, for example, whether two elements x and y are similar, can be treated as a matter of degree. The standard model for the set of (quasi) truth values of fuzzy logic and other many-valued logical systems is the unit interval. If E(x, y) represents the (quasi) truth value of the statement that x is c 2006 Bernhard Moser. M OSER similar to y, then the many-valued version of transitivity is modeled by T (E(x, y), E(y, z)) ≤ E(x, z) where T is a so-called triangular norm which is an extension of the Boolean conjunction. This many-valued concept for transitivity is called T -transitivity. For a survey on triangular norms see, for example, Dubois and Prade (1985), Gottwald (1986), Gottwald (1993) and Klement et al. (2000), ¨ and for fuzzy equivalence relations and T -transitivity see, for example, Bodenhofer (2003), H ohle (1993), H¨ hle (1999), Klement et al. (2000), and Zadeh (1971). o Based on the semantics of fuzzy logic, this approach allows to incorporate knowledge-based models for the design of kernels. From this perspective, the most interesting mathematical question is how positive-semideﬁnite fuzzy equivalence relations can be characterized or at least constructed under some circumstances. At least for some special cases, proofs are provided in Section 4, which motivate further research aiming at establishing a more general theory on the positive-deﬁniteness of fuzzy equivalence relations. These cases are based on the most prominent representatives of triangular norms, that is the Minimum, the Product and the Łukasiewicz t-norm. The paper is structured as follows. First of all, in Section 2, some basic prerequisites concerning kernels and fuzzy relations are outlined. In Section 3, a result about the T -transitivity of kernels from Moser (2006) is cited and interpreted as existence statement that guarantees a representation of kernels mapping to the unit interval with constant 1 in its diagonal by a certain, commonly used, fuzzy-logical construction of a fuzzy equivalence relation. Finally, in contrast to the pure existence theorem of Section 3, in Section 4 constructive examples of fuzzy equivalence relations are provided which are proven to be kernels. In a concluding remark, the relationship to the problem of labeled and unlabeled learning is pointed out. 2. Prerequisites This section summarizes deﬁnitions and facts from the theory of kernels as well as from fuzzy set theory which are needed later on. 2.1 Kernels and Positive-Semideﬁniteness Preserving Functions There is an extensive literature concerning kernels and kernel-based methods like support vector machines or kernel principal component analysis especially in the machine learning, data mining ¨ and computer vision communities. For an overview and introduction, see, for example, Sch olkopf and Smola (2002). Here we present only what is needed later on. For completeness let us recall the basic deﬁnition for kernels and positive-semideﬁniteness. Deﬁnition 1 Let X be a non-empty set. A real-valued function k : X × X → R is said to be a kernel iff it is symmetric, that is, k(x, y) = k(y, x) for all x, y ∈ X , and positive-semideﬁnite, that is, ∑n j=1 ci c j k(xi , x j ) ≥ 0 for any n ∈ N, any choice of x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X and any choice of c1 , . . . , cn ∈ R. i, One way to generate new kernels from known kernels is to apply operations which preserve the positive-semideﬁniteness property. A characterization of such operations is provided by C. H. FitzGerald (1995). Theorem 2 (Closeness Properties of Kernels) Let f : Rn → R, n ∈ N, then k : X × X → R given by k(x, y) := f (k1 (x, y), . . . , kn (x, y)) 2604 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS is a kernel for any choice of kernels k1 , . . . , kn on X × X iff f is the real restriction of an entire function on Cn of the form f (x1 , . . . , xn ) = ∑ r1 ≥0,...,rn ≥0 r r cr1 ,...,rn x11 · · · xnn (1) where cr1 ,...,rn ≥ 0 for all nonnegative indices r1 , . . . , rn . 2.2 Triangular Norms Triangular norms have been originally studied within the framework of probabilistic metric spaces, see Schweizer and Sklar (1961) and Schweizer and Sklar (1983). In this context, t-norms proved to be an appropriate concept when dealing with triangle inequalities. Later on, t-norms and their dual version, t-conorms, have been used to model conjunction and disjunction for many-valued logic, see Dubois and Prade (1985), Gottwald (1986), Gottwald (1993) and Klement et al. (2000). Deﬁnition 3 A function T : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] is called t-norm (triangular norm), if it satisﬁes the following conditions: (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) ∀x, y ∈ [0, 1] : ∀x, y, z ∈ [0, 1] : ∀x, y, z ∈ [0, 1] : ∀x, y ∈ [0, 1] : T (x, y) = T (y, x) T (x, T (y, z)) = T (T (x, y), z) y ≤ z =⇒ T (x, y) ≤ T (x, z) T (x, 1) = x ∧ T (1, y) = y (commutativity) (associativity) (monotonicity) (boundary condition) Further, a t-norm is called Archimedean if it is continuous and satisﬁes x ∈ (0, 1) ⇒ T (x, x) < x. Due to its associativity, many-placed extensions Tn : [0, 1]n → [0, 1], n ∈ N, of a t-norm T are uniquely determined by Tn (x1 , . . . , xn ) = T (x1 , Tn−1 (x2 , . . . , xn )). Archimedean t-norms are characterized by the following representation theorem due to Ling (1965): Theorem 4 Let T : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] be a t-norm. Then T is Archimedean if, and only if, there is a continuous, strictly decreasing function f : [0, 1] → [0, ∞] with f (1) = 0 such that for x, y ∈ [0, 1], T (x, y) = f −1 (min( f (x) + f (y), f (0))). By setting g(x) = exp (− f (x)), Ling’s characterization yields an alternative representation with a multiplicative generator function T (x, y) = g−1 (max(g(x) g(y), g(0))). For g(x) = x we get the product TP (x, y) = x y. The setting f (x) = 1 − x yields the so-called Łukasiewcz t-norm TL (x, y) = max(x + y − 1, 0). Due to Ling’s theorem 4 an Archimedean t-norm T is isomorphic either to TL or TP , depending on whether the additive generator takes a ﬁnite value at 0 or not. In the former case, the Archimedean t-norm is called non-strict, in the latter it is called strict. 2605 M OSER A many-valued model of an implication is provided by the so-called residuum given by → T (a, b) = sup{c ∈ [0, 1]|T (a, c) ≤ b} (2) where T is a left-continuous t-norm. Equation (2) is uniquely determined by the so-called adjunction property → ∀a, b, c ∈ [0, 1] : T (a, b) ≤ c ⇔ a ≤ T (b, c). Consequently, the operator ↔ → → T (a, b) = min T (a, b), T (b, a) (3) (4) models a biimplication. For details, for example, see Gottwald (1986) and Klement et al. (2000). → Tables 1 and 2 list examples of t-norms with their induced residuum T . For further examples see, for example, Klement et al. (2000). √ √ Tcos (a, b) = max(ab − 1 − a2 1 − b2 , 0) TL (a, b) = max(a + b − 1, 0) TP (a, b) = ab TM (a, b) = min(a, b) Table 1: Examples of t-norms → T cos (a, b) = → T L (a, b) = → = T P (a, b) → T M (a, b) = cos(arccos(b) − arccos(a)) if a > b, 1 else min(b − a + 1, 1) b if a > b, a 1 else b if a > b, 1 else Table 2: Examples of residuums 2.3 T -Equivalences If we want to classify based on a notion of similarity or indistinguishability, we face the problem of transitivity. For instance, let us consider two real numbers to be indistinguishable if and only if they differ by at most a certain bound ε > 0, this is modeled by the relation ∼ ε given by x ∼ε y :⇔ |x−y| < ε, ε > 0, x, y ∈ R. Note that the relation ∼ε is not transitive and, therefore, not an equivalence relation. The transitivity requirement turns out to be too strong for this example. The problem of identiﬁcation and transitivity in the context of similarity of physical objects was early pointed out and discussed philosophically by Poincar´ (1902) and Poincar´ (1904). In the framework of fuzzy e e logic, the way to overcome this problem is to model similarity by fuzzy relations based on a many¨ valued concept of transitivity, see Bodenhofer (2003), H ohle (1993), H¨ hle (1999), Klement et al. o (2000) and Zadeh (1971). 2606 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS Deﬁnition 5 A function E : X 2 −→ [0, 1] is called a fuzzy equivalence relation, or synonymously, T -equivalence with respect to the t-norm T if it satisﬁes the following conditions: (i) ∀x ∈ X : E(x, x) = 1 (reﬂexivity) (ii) ∀x, y ∈ X : E(x, y) = E(y, x) (symmetry) (iii) ∀x, y, z ∈ X : T (E(x, y), E(y, z)) ≤ E(x, z) (T-transitivity). The value E(x, y) can be also looked at as the (quasi) truth value of the statement “x is equal to y”. Following this semantics, T-transitivity can be seen as a many-valued model of the proposition, “If x is equal to y and y is equal to z, then x is equal to z”. T -equivalences for Archimedean t-norms are closely related to metrics and pseudo-metrics as shown by Klement et al. (2000) and Moser (1995). Theorem 6 Let T be an Archimedean t-norm given by ∀a, b ∈ [0, 1] : T (a, b) = f −1 (min( f (a) + f (b), f (0))), where f : [0, 1] → [0, ∞] is a strictly decreasing, continuous function with f (1) = 0. (i) If d : X 2 → [0, ∞[ is a pseudo-metric, then the function Ed : X 2 → [0, 1] deﬁned by Ed (x, y) = f −1 (min(d(x, y), f (0))) is a T -equivalence with respect to the t-norm T . (ii) If E : X 2 → [0, 1] is a T -equivalence relation, then the function dE : X 2 → [0, ∞] deﬁned by dE (x, y) = f (E(x, y)) is a pseudo-metric. → Another way to construct T -equivalences is to employ T -operators. The proof of the following assertion can be found in Trillas and Valverde (1984), Kruse et al. (1993) and Kruse et al. (1994). ↔ Theorem 7 Let T be a left-continuous t-norm, T its induced biimplication, µi : X → [0, 1], i ∈ I, I non-empty; then E : X × X → [0, 1] given by ↔ E(x, y) = inf T (µi (x), µi (y)) i∈I (5) is a T -equivalence relation. ¨ For further details on T -equivalences see also Boixader and Jacas (1999), H oppner et al. (2002), Jacas (1988), Trillas et al. (1999) and Valverde (1985). 3. Representing Kernels by T -Equivalences It is interesting that the concept of kernels, which is motivated by geometric reasoning in terms of inner products and mappings to Hilbert spaces and which is inherently formulated by algebraic terms, is closely related to the concept of fuzzy equivalence relations as demonstrated and discussed in more detail in Moser (2006). In this section, we start with the result that any kernel k : X × X → [0, 1] with k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X is T -transitive and, therefore, a fuzzy equivalence relation. The proof can be found in Moser (2006), see also Appendix A.1. 2607 M OSER Theorem 8 Any kernel k : X × X → [0, 1] with k(x, x) = 1 is (at least) Tcos -transitive, where 1 − a2 Tcos (a, b) = max{a b − 1 − b2 , 0}. (6) The nomenclature is motivated by the fact that the triangular norm deﬁned by Equation (6) is an Archimedean t-norm which is generated by the arcosine function as its additive generator. From this result, the following existence theorem can be derived, which guarantees that any kernel under consideration can be represented by the fuzzy-logical formula given by (5). In fuzzy systems, this formula is commonly used for modeling rule bases (see, for example, Kruse et al., 1993, 1994). Theorem 9 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, k : X × X → [0, 1] a kernel in the sense of Deﬁnition 1 and k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X ; then there is a family of membership functions µ i : X → [0, 1], i ∈ I, I non-empty and a t-norm T , such that ↔ ∀x, y ∈ X : k(x, y) = inf T (µi (x), µi (y)). i∈I (7) Proof. Let us set I := X , µx0 (x) = k(x, x0 ) and let us choose Tcos as t-norm. For convenience let us denote ↔ h(x, y) = inf T cos (µx0 (x), µx0 (y)), x0 ∈X which is equivalent to ↔ h(x, y) = inf T cos (k(x0 , x), k(x0 , y)). x0 ∈X According to Theorem 8, k is Tcos -transitive, that is, ↔ ∀x0 , x, y ∈ X : T cos (k(x0 , x), k(x0 , y)) ≤ k(x, y). This implies that h(x, y) ≤ k(x, y) for all x, y ∈ X . Now let us consider the other inequality. Due to the adjunction property (3), we obtain → Tcos (k(x, y), k(x0 , y)) ≤ k(x, x0 ) ⇔ k(x, y) ≤ T cos (k(x0 , y), k(x, x0 )) and → Tcos (k(x, y), k(x0 , x)) ≤ k(y, x0 ) ⇔ k(x, y) ≤ T cos (k(x0 , x), k(y, x0 )), from which it follows that → → ∀x, y, x0 ∈ X : k(x, y) ≤ min{ T cos (k(x0 , y), k(x, x0 )), T cos (k(x0 , x), k(y, x0 ))}. Hence by Deﬁnition 4, ∀x, y ∈ X : k(x, y) ≤ h(x, y) which ends the proof. For an arbitrary choice of fuzzy membership functions, there is no necessity that the resulting relation (7) implies positive-semideﬁniteness and, therefore, a kernel. For an example of a Tcos equivalence which is not a kernel see Appendix A.4. Theorem 9 guarantees only the existence of a representation of the form (5) but it does not tell us how to construct the membership functions µ i . In the following section, we provide examples of fuzzy equivalence relations which yield kernels for any choice of membership functions. 2608 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS 4. Constructing Kernels by Fuzzy Equivalence Relations In the Boolean case, positive-deﬁniteness and equivalence are synonymous, that is, a Boolean relation R : X × X → {0, 1} is positive-deﬁnite if and only if R is the indicator function of an equivalence relation ∼ that is, R(x, y) = 1 if x ∼ y and R(x, y) = 0 if x ∼ y. For a proof, see Appendix A.2. This = = =, relationship can be used to obtain an extension to fuzzy relations as given by the next theorem whose proof can be found in the Appendix A.3. Theorem 10 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, µ i : X → [0, 1], i ∈ I, I non-empty; then the fuzzy equivalence relation EM : X × X → [0, 1] given by ↔ EM (x, y) = inf T M (µi (x), µi (y)) i∈I is positive-semideﬁnite. In the following, the most prominent representatives of Archimedean t-norms, the Product TP and the Łukasiewicz t-norm TL , are used to construct positive-semideﬁnite fuzzy similarity relations. Though the ﬁrst part can also be derived from a result due to Yaglom (1957) that characterizes isotropic stationary kernels by its spectral representation, here we prefer to present a direct, elementary proof. Compare also Bochner (1955) and Genton (2001). Theorem 11 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, ν : X → [0, 1] and let h : [0, 1] → [0, 1] be an isomorphism of the unit interval that can be expanded in the manner of Equation (1), that is h(x) = ∑k ck xk with ck ≥ 0; then the fuzzy equivalence relations EL,h , EP,h : X × X → [0, 1] given by ↔ EL,h (x, y) = h T L h−1 (ν(x)) , h−1 (ν(y)) and ↔ EP,h (x, y) = h T P h−1 (ν(x)) , h−1 (ν(y)) (8) (9) are positive-semideﬁnite. Proof. To prove the positive-deﬁniteness of the two-placed functions E L,h and EP,h given by equations (8) and (9) respectively, we have to show that n n ∑ i, j=1 EL,h (xi , xi ) ci c j ≥ 0, ∑ i, j=1 EP,h (xi , x j ) ci c j ≥ 0 for any n ∈ N and any choice of x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X , respectively. According to an elementary result from Linear Algebra this is equivalent to the assertion that the determinants (1 ≤ m ≤ n) Dm = det (E(xi , x j ))i, j∈{1,...,m} of the minors of the matrix (E(xi , x j ))i, j satisfy ∀m ∈ {1, . . . , n} : Dm ≥ 0, where E denotes either EL,h or EP,h . Recall that the determinant of a matrix is invariant with respect to renaming the indices, that is, if σ : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n} is a permutation then det [(ai j )i, j ] = det (aσ(i)σ( j) )i, j . 2609 M OSER For convenience, let denote µi = h−1 (ν(xi )). Then, without loss of generality, we may assume that the values µi are ordered monotonically decreasing, that is, µi ≥ µ j for i < j. ↔ → (10) → Case TL : Note that T L (a, b) = min{ T L (a, b), T L (b, a)} = 1 − |a − b|. Then we have to show that for all dimensions n ∈ N, the determinant of E (n) = (1 − |µi − µ j |)i, j∈{1,...,n} is non-negative, that is Due to the assumption (10), we have det[E (n) ] ≥ 0. 1 − |µi − µ j | = 1 − (µi − µ j ) if i ≤ j, 1 − (µ j − µi ) else which yields   . . . 1 − (µ1 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ1 − µn )  . . . 1 − (µ2 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ2 − µn )     . . . 1 − (µ3 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ3 − µn )    (n) E = . . . .. . .   . . .   1 − (µ1 − µn−1 ) 1 − (µ2 − µn−1 ) . . . 1 1 − (µn−1 − µn ) 1 − (µ1 − µn ) 1 − (µ2 − µn ) . . . 1 − (µn−1 − µn ) 1 1 − (µ1 − µ2 ) 1 1 − (µ2 − µ3 ) . . . 1 1 − (µ1 − µ2 ) 1 − (µ1 − µ3 ) . . . Now let us apply determinant-invariant elementary column operations to simplify this matrix by subtracting the column with index i − 1 from the column with index i, i ≥ 2. This yields   1 µ2 − µ1 ... µn−1 − µn−2 µn − µn−1  1 − (µ1 − µ2 ) −(µ2 − µ1 ) . . . µn−1 − µn−2 µn − µn−1     1 − (µ1 − µ3 ) −(µ2 − µ1 ) . . . µn−1 − µn−2 µn − µn−1    ˜ E (n) =  . . . . . .. . . . .   . . . . .   1 − (µ1 − µn−1 ) −(µ2 − µ1 ) . . . −(µn−2 − µn−1 ) µn − µn−1  1 − (µ1 − µn ) −(µ2 − µ1 ) . . . −(µn−2 − µn−1 ) −(µn−1 − µn ) Therefore, α = n ∏(µi−1 − µi ) ≥ 0 (11) i=2 ˜ ˆ det[E (n) ] = det[E (n) ] = α det[En ], where   . . . −1 −1  . . . −1 −1    . . . −1 −1   (n) ˆ E = . . . .. . .   . . .   1 − (µ1 − µn−1 ) +1 . . . +1 −1 1 − (µ1 − µn ) +1 . . . +1 +1 1 1 − (µ1 − µ2 ) 1 − (µ1 − µ3 ) . . . 2610 −1 +1 +1 . . . (12) G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS Let us apply Laplacian determinant expansion by minors to the ﬁrst column of matrix (12), that is n det[A] = ∑ (−1)i+ j ai j det[Ai j ] i=1 where A = (ai j ) is an n × n-matrix, j arbitrarily chosen from {1, . . . , n} and Ai j is the matrix corresponding to the cofactor ai j obtained by canceling out the i-th row and the j-th column from A (see, ˆ for example, Muir, 1960). For n = 1, we get the trivial case det[ E (1) ] = 1. Note that the ﬁrst and (n) ˆ the last rows of the matrices Ei,1 for 1 < i < n only differ by their signum, consequently the minors ˆ (n) det[Ei,1 ] for 1 < i < n, n ≥ 2, are vanishing, that is, det[Ai,1 ] = 0, for 1 < i < n. Therefore, according to the Laplacian expansion, we get (n) (n) ˆ ˆ ˆ det[E (n) ] = 1 · det[E1,1 ] + (−1)n (1 − (µ1 − µn )) · det[E1,n ]. (13) Observe that (n) ˆ det[E1,1 ] = 2n−2 (n) ˆ det[E1,n ] = (−1)n−1 2n−2 . Consequently, Equation (13) simpliﬁes to ˆ det[E (n) ] = 2n−2 1 + (−1)n (−1)n−1 2n−2 (1 − (µ1 − µn )) = 2n−2 (1 − (1 − (µ1 − µn ))) = 2n−2 (µ1 − µn ) ≥ 0 which together with (11) proves the ﬁrst case. ↔ → → Case TP : First of all, let us compute T P (a, b) = min{ T P (a, b), T L (b, a)}. Hence,  min{ b , a } if a, b > 0,  a b   0 ↔ if a = 0 and b > 0 , T P (a, b) = 0 if b = 0 and a > 0 ,    1 if a = 0 and b = 0 . Again, without loss of generality, let us suppose that the values µ i , i ∈ {1, . . . , n} are ordered monotonically decreasing, that is µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ . . . ≥ µn . Before checking the general case, let us consider the special case of vanishing µ-values. For this, let us assume for the moment that µi = > 0 if i < i0 , 0 else ↔ ↔ which implies that T P (µi , µ j ) = 0 for i < i0 and j ≥ i0 and T P (µi , µ j ) = 1 for i ≥ i0 and j ≥ i0 . This leads to a decomposition of the matrix ↔ E (n) = T P (µi , µ j ) 2611 ij M OSER such that det[E (n) ] = det[E (i0 −1) ] · det[In−i0 −1 ] where Ik denotes the k × k-matrix with constant entries 1, hence det[In−i0 −1 ] ∈ {0, 1}. Therefore, we may assume that µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ . . . ≥ µn > 0. Then we have to show that for all dimensions n ∈ N, the determinant of µi µ j , µ j µi E (n) = min i, j∈{1,...,n} is non-negative, that is det[E (n) ] ≥ 0.

By this, the determinant of the matrix in Equation (15) readily turns out to be n−1 µi+1 ˜ det[E (n) ] = det[E (n) ] = ∏ 1 − µi i=1 2 ≥0 which together with Theorem (2) ends the proof. Note that relations (8) and (9) are T -transitive with respect to the corresponding isomorphic Archimedean t-norms, TL,h (x, y) = h(TL (h−1 (x), h−1 (x))) and TP,h (x, y) = h(TP (h−1 (x), h−1 (x))), respectively. 2612 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS Corollary 12 Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse, µ i : X → [0, 1], λi ∈ ]0, 1] with ∑i λi = 1 ˜ ˜ where i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, n ∈ N, then the fuzzy equivalence relations EL , EP : X × X → [0, 1] given by n ↔ ˜ EL (x, y) = ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)) (16) i=1 and n ↔ ˜ EP (x, y) = ∏ T P (µi (x), µi (y)) λi (17) i=1 are TL - and TP -equivalences, respectively, and kernels. Proof. First of all, let us check the TL -transitivity of formula (16). This can readily be shown by ↔ means of the deﬁnition of TL and the TL -transitivity of T L due to the following inequalities: n TL n ↔ i=1 n n ↔ ↔ n ↔ ↔ ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)) + ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (z)) − 1 , 0 i=1 i=1 n max = i=1 i=1 n = i=1 ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)) + ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (z)) − 1, 0 max max ↔ ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (y)), ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (yz) n ↔ ↔ ∑ λi TL T L (µi (x), µi (y)), ∑ λi T L (µi (y), µi (z)) , 0 i=1 i=1 n max ↔ ∑ λi T L (µi (x), µi (z)), 0 ≤ ≤ = i=1 ↔ λi T L (µi (x), µi (z)). ↔ This, together with the TP -transitivity of T P , proves that the formulas given by (16) and (17) are TL and TP -equivalences, respectively. Expanding the factors of formula (17) yields  1 if µi (x) = µi (y) = 0, λi ↔ λi λi (18) T P (µi (x), µi (y)) =  min(µiλi(x),µiλi(y)) else max(µi (x),µi (y)) which by comparing case TP of the proof of Theorem 11 shows that the left-hand side of Equation (18) is positive-semideﬁnite. As the convex combination and the product are special cases of positive-semideﬁniteness preserving functions according to Theorem 1, the functions deﬁned by equations (16) and (17) prove to be again positive-semideﬁnite and, therefore, kernels. It is interesting to observe that both formulas (16) and (17) can be expressed in the form, f ( τ(x) − τ(y) 1 ), where f : I → [0, 1], I some interval, is a strictly decreasing function, τ : X → I n , I some interval, τ(x) = (τ1 (x), . . . , τn (x)) and τ(x) 1 = ∑n |τi (x)|. Indeed, for Equation (16) let us deﬁne i=1 fL : [0, 1] → [0, 1], fL (a) = 1 − a τL : X → [0, 1] , τL (x) = (λ1 µ1 (x), . . . , λn µn (x)) n 2613 M OSER and for Equation (17) and positive membership functions µ i , µi (x) > 0 for all x ∈ X , let us deﬁne fP : [0, ∞[→ [0, 1], fP (a) = e−a τP : X → ] − ∞, 1]n , τP (x) = (λ1 ln(µ1 (x)), . . . , λn ln(µn (x))) Therefore, we get ˜ EL (x, y) = 1 − τL (x) − τL (y) ˜ EP (x, y) = e− τP (x)−τP (y) 1 . 1 (19) (20) While formulas (19) and (20) provide a geometrical interpretation by means of the norm . 1 , the corresponding formulas (16) and (17) yield a semantical model of the assertion “IF x is equal to y with respect to feature µ1 AND . . . AND x is equal to y with respect to feature µn THEN x is equal to y” as aggregation of biimplications in terms of fuzzy logic. While in the former case, the aggregation has some compensatory effect, the latter is just a conjunction in terms of the Product triangular norm. For details on aggregation operators see, for example, Saminger et al. (2002) and Calvo et al. (2002). The formulas (16) and (17) coincide for the following special case. If the membership functions µi are indicator functions of sets Ai ⊆ X which form a partition of X , then the kernels (16) and (17) reduce to the indicator function characterizing the Boolean equivalence relation induced by this partition {A1 , . . . , An }. The formulas (16) and (17) for general membership functions therefore provide kernels which can be interpreted to be induced by a family of fuzzy sets and, in particular, by fuzzy partitions, that is, families of fuzzy sets fulﬁlling some criteria which extend the axioms for a Boolean partition in a many-valued logical sense. For deﬁnitions and further details on fuzzy partitions see, for ¨ example, De Baets and Mesiar (1998), Demirci (2003) and H oppner and Klawonn (2003). It is a frequently used paradigm that the decision boundaries for a classiﬁcation problem lie between clusters rather than intersecting them. Due to this cluster hypothesis, the problem of designing kernels based on fuzzy partitions is closely related to the problem of learning kernels from unlabeled data. For further details on semi-supervised learning see, for example, Seeger (2002), Chapelle et al. (2003) and T. M. Huang (2006). It is left to future research to explore this relationship to the problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data and related concepts like covariance kernels. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have presented a novel view on kernels from a fuzzy logical point of view. Particularly, the similarity-measure aspect of a kernel is addressed and investigated by means of the so-called T -transitivity which is characteristic for fuzzy equivalence relations. As a consequence, we derived that a large class of kernels can be represented in a way that is commonly used for representing fuzzy rule bases. In addition to this proof for the existence of such a representation, constructive examples are presented. It is the idea of this research to look for a combination of knowledge-based strategies with kernel-based methods in order to facilitate a more ﬂexible designing process of kernels which also allows to incorporate prior knowledge. Further research aims at 2614 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS analyzing the behavior of kernels constructed in this way when applied in the various kernel methods like support vector machines, kernel principal components analysis and others. In particular, it is intended to focus on the problem of learning kernels from unlabeled data where the fuzzy partitions are induced by appropriate clustering principles.

For sake of completeness the following sections provide proofs regarding Theorem 8, the characterization of kernels in the Boolean case and the construction of kernels by means of the minimum t-norm TM . Furthermore, in Section A.4 an example of a non-positive-semideﬁnite Tcos -equivalence is given. A.1 Proof of Theorem 8 Let us start with the analysis of 3-dimensional matrices. Lemma 13 Let M = (mi j )i j ∈ [0, 1]3×3 be a 3 × 3 symmetric matrix with mii = 1, i = 1, 2, 3; then M is positive-semideﬁnite iff for all i, j, k ∈ {1, 2, 3} there holds mi j m jk − 1 − m2j i 1 − m2 ≤ mik jk Proof. For simplicity, let a = m1,2 , b = m1,3 and c = m2,3 . Then the determinant of M, Det(M), is a function of the variables a, b, c given by D(a, b, c) = 1 + 2abc − a2 − b2 − c2 . For any choice of a, b, the quadratic equation D(a, b, c) = 0 can be solved for c, yielding two solutions c1 = c1 (a, b) and c2 = c2 (a, b) as functions of a and b, c1 (a, b) = ab − c2 (a, b) = ab + 1 − a2 1 − a2 1 − b2 1 − b2 . Obviously, for all |a| ≤ 1 and |b| ≤ 1, the values c1 (a, b) and c2 (a, b) are real. By substituting a = cos α and b = cos(β) with α, β ∈ [0, π ], it becomes readily clear that 2 c1 (a, b) = c1 (cos(α), cos(β)) = cos(α) cos(β) − sin(α) sin(β) = cos(α + β) ∈ [−1, 1] 2615 M OSER and, analogously, c2 (a, b) = c2 (cos(α), cos(β)) = cos(α) cos(β) + sin(α) sin(β) = cos(α − β) ∈ [−1, 1]. As for all a, b ∈ [−1, 1] the determinant function Da,b (c) := D(a, b, c) is quadratic in c with negative coefﬁcient for c2 , there is a uniquely determined maximum at c0 (a, b) = ab. Note that for all a, b ∈ [−1, 1], we have c1 (a, b) ≤ c0 (a, b) ≤ c2 (a, b) and D(a, b, c0 (a, b)) = 1 + 2ab(ab) − a2 − b2 − (ab)2 = (1 − a2 )(1 − b2 ) ≥ 0. Therefore, D(a, b, c) ≥ 0 if and only if c ∈ [c1 (a, b), c2 (a, b)]. Recall from linear algebra that by renaming the indices, the determinant does not change. Therefore, without loss of generality, we may assume that a ≥ b ≥ c. For convenience, let Q = {(x, y, z) ∈ [0, 1]3 |x ≥ y ≥ z}. Then, obviously, for any choice of a, b ∈ [0, 1] there holds (a, b, c1 (a, b)) ∈ Q. Elementary algebra shows that (a, b, c2 (a, b)) ∈ Q is only the case for a = b = 1. As for a = b = 1 the two solutions c1 , c2 coincide, that is, c1 (1, 1) = c2 (1, 1) = 1, it follows that for any choice of (a, b, c) ∈ Q, there holds D(a, b, c) ≥ 0 if and only if c1 (a, b) = ab − 1 − a2 1 − b2 ≤ c. (21) If (a, b, c) ∈ Q, then the inequality (21) is trivially satisﬁed which together with (21) proves the lemma Now Theorem 8 immediately follows from Deﬁnition (1), Lemma (13) and the characterizing inequality (21). A.2 Characterization of Kernels in the Boolean Case ¨ The following lemma and proposition can also be found as an exercise in Sch olkopf and Smola (2002). Lemma 14 Let ∼ be an equivalence relation on X and let k : X × X → {0, 1} be induced by ∼ via k(x, y) = 1 if and only if x ∼ y; then k is a kernel. Proof. By deﬁnition of positive-deﬁniteness, let us consider an arbitrary sequence of elements x1 , . . . , xn . Then there are at most n equivalence classes Q1 , . . . , Qm on the set of indices {1, . . . , n}, S / m ≤ n, where i=1,...,m Qi = {1, . . . , n} and Qi ∩ Q j = 0 for i = j. Note that k(xi , x j ) = 0 if the indices 2616 G ENERATING K ERNELS BY F UZZY R ELATIONS i, j belong to different equivalence classes. Then, for any choice of reals c 1 , . . . , cn , we obtain ∑ ci c j k(xi , x j ) m = i, j ∑ ∑ ci c j k(xi , x j ) p=1 i, j∈Q p m = ∑ ∑ p=1 i, j∈Q p ci c j · 1 2 m = ∑ ∑ ci p=1 i∈Q p ≥ 0 Proposition 15 k : X × X → {0, 1} with k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X is a kernel if and only if it is induced by an equivalence relation. Proof. It only remains to be shown that if k is a kernel, then it is the indicator function of an equivalence relation, that is, it is induced by an equivalence relation. If k is a kernel, according to Lemma 13, for all x, y, z ∈ X , it has to satisfy Tcos (k(x, y), k(y, z)) ≤ k(x, z), which implies, k(x, y) = 1, k(y, z) = 1 =⇒ k(x, z) = 1. Obviously, we have k(x, x) = 1 and k(x, y) = k(y, x) due to the reﬂexivity and symmetry assumption of k, respectively. A.3 Constructing Kernels by TM For convenience let us recall the basic notion of an α-cut from fuzzy set theory: Deﬁnition 16 Let X be a non-empty set and µ : X → [0, 1]; then [µ]α = {x ∈ X | µ(x) ≥ α} is called the α-cut of the membership function µ. Lemma 17 k : X × X → [0, 1] is a TM -equivalence if and only if all α-cuts of k are Boolean equivalence relations. Proof. (i) Let us assume that k is a TM -equivalence. Let α ∈ [0, 1], then by deﬁnition, [k]α = {(x, y) ∈ X × X | k(x, y) ≥ α}. In order to show that [k]α is a Boolean equivalence, the axioms for reﬂexivity, symmetry and transitivity have to be shown. Reﬂexivity and symmetry are trivially satisﬁed as for all x, y ∈ X , there holds by assumption that k(x, x) = 1 and k(x, y) = k(y, x). In order to show transitivity, let us consider (x, y), (y, z) ∈ [k]α , that means k(x, y) ≥ α and k(y, z) ≥ α; then by the TM -transitivity assumption it follows that α ≤ min(k(x, y), k(y, z)) ≤ k(x, z), hence (x, z) ∈ [k]α . 2617 M OSER (ii) Suppose now that all α-cuts of k are Boolean equivalence relations. Then, in particular, [k] α with α = 1 is reﬂexive, hence k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X . The symmetry of k follows from the fact that for all α ∈ [0, 1] and pairs (x, y) ∈ [k]α , by assumption, we have (y, x) ∈ [k]α . In order to show the TM -transitivity property, let us consider arbitrarily chosen elements x, y, z ∈ X . Let α = min(k(x, y), k(y, z)); then by the transitivity assumption of [k] α , it follows that (x, z) ∈ [k]α , consequently k(x, z) ≥ α = min(k(x, y), k(y, z)). Proposition 18 If k : X × X → [0, 1] is a TM -equivalence then it is positive-semideﬁnite. Proof. Choose arbitrary elements x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X and consider the set of values which are taken by all combinations k(xi , x j ), i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} and order them increasingly, that is k(xi , x j )| i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}} = {α1 , . . . , αm , where 0 ≤ α1 ≤ · · · αm ≤ 1. Observe that for all pairs (xi , x j ), i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} there holds m k(xi , x j ) = ∑ (αv − αv−1 )1[k] αv v=2 (xi , x j ) + α1 1[k]α1 (xi , x j ) showing that on the set {x1 , . . . , xn } × {x1 , . . . , xn }, the function k is a linear combination of indicator functions of Boolean equivalences (which are positive-semideﬁnite by Proposition 15) with nonnegative coefﬁcients and, consequently, it has to be positive semideﬁnite. A.4 Example of a Non-Positive-Semideﬁnite Tcos -Equivalence For dimensions n > 3, the Tcos -transitivity is no longer sufﬁcient to guarantee positive semi(n) deﬁniteness. Consider, for example An = (ai j )i j where  λ  (n) ai j = 1   0 if min(i, j) = 1, max(i, j) > 1 , if i = j, else . (22) √ (n) (n) (n) Choose λ = 1/ 2, then Tcos (λ, λ) = 0, hence we have Tcos (ai j , a jk ) ≤ aik for all indices i, j, k ∈ 1, . . . , n. As det(An ) < 0 for n > 3, the matrix An cannot be positive-semideﬁnite though the Tcos transitivity conditions are satisﬁed. References S. Bochner. Harmonic Analysis and the Theory of Probability.

<p>Author: Don Hush, Patrick Kelly, Clint Scovel, Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: We describe polynomial–time algorithms that produce approximate solutions with guaranteed accuracy for a class of QP problems that are used in the design of support vector machine classiﬁers. These algorithms employ a two–stage process where the ﬁrst stage produces an approximate solution to a dual QP problem and the second stage maps this approximate dual solution to an approximate primal solution. For the second stage we describe an O(n log n) algorithm that maps an √ √ approximate dual solution with accuracy (2 2Kn + 8 λ)−2 λε2 to an approximate primal solution p with accuracy ε p where n is the number of data samples, Kn is the maximum kernel value over the data and λ > 0 is the SVM regularization parameter. For the ﬁrst stage we present new results for decomposition algorithms and describe new decomposition algorithms with guaranteed accuracy and run time. In particular, for τ–rate certifying decomposition algorithms we establish the optimality of τ = 1/(n − 1). In addition we extend the recent τ = 1/(n − 1) algorithm of Simon (2004) to form two new composite algorithms that also achieve the τ = 1/(n − 1) iteration bound of List and Simon (2005), but yield faster run times in practice. We also exploit the τ–rate certifying property of these algorithms to produce new stopping rules that are computationally efﬁcient and that guarantee a speciﬁed accuracy for the approximate dual solution. Furthermore, for the dual QP problem corresponding to the standard classiﬁcation problem we describe operational conditions for which the Simon and composite algorithms possess an upper bound of O(n) on the number of iterations. For this same problem we also describe general conditions for which a matching lower bound exists for any decomposition algorithm that uses working sets of size 2. For the Simon and composite algorithms we also establish an O(n2 ) bound on the overall run time for the ﬁrst stage. Combining the ﬁrst and second stages gives an overall run time of O(n2 (c</p><p>5 0.21484786 <a title="13-lsi-5" href="./jmlr-2006-New_Algorithms_for_Efficient_High-Dimensional_Nonparametric_Classification.html">63 jmlr-2006-New Algorithms for Efficient High-Dimensional Nonparametric Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ting Liu, Andrew W. Moore, Alexander Gray</p><p>Abstract: This paper is about non-approximate acceleration of high-dimensional nonparametric operations such as k nearest neighbor classiﬁers. We attempt to exploit the fact that even if we want exact answers to nonparametric queries, we usually do not need to explicitly ﬁnd the data points close to the query, but merely need to answer questions about the properties of that set of data points. This offers a small amount of computational leeway, and we investigate how much that leeway can be exploited. This is applicable to many algorithms in nonparametric statistics, memory-based learning and kernel-based learning. But for clarity, this paper concentrates on pure k-NN classiﬁcation. We introduce new ball-tree algorithms that on real-world data sets give accelerations from 2-fold to 100-fold compared against highly optimized traditional ball-tree-based k-NN . These results include data sets with up to 106 dimensions and 105 records, and demonstrate non-trivial speed-ups while giving exact answers. keywords: ball-tree, k-NN classiﬁcation</p><p>6 0.21477574 <a title="13-lsi-6" href="./jmlr-2006-Accurate_Error_Bounds_for_the_Eigenvalues_of_the_Kernel_Matrix.html">9 jmlr-2006-Accurate Error Bounds for the Eigenvalues of the Kernel Matrix</a></p>

<p>Author: Kristin P. Bennett, Emilio Parrado-Hernández</p><p>Abstract: The ﬁelds of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semideﬁnite, and semi-inﬁnite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for speciﬁc classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.

<p>Author: Hema Raghavan, Omid Madani, Rosie Jones</p><p>Abstract: We extend the traditional active learning framework to include feedback on features in addition to labeling instances, and we execute a careful study of the effects of feature selection and human feedback on features in the setting of text categorization. Our experiments on a variety of categorization tasks indicate that there is signiﬁcant potential in improving classiﬁer performance by feature re-weighting, beyond that achieved via membership queries alone (traditional active learning) if we have access to an oracle that can point to the important (most predictive) features. Our experiments on human subjects indicate that human feedback on feature relevance can identify a sufﬁcient proportion of the most relevant features (over 50% in our experiments). We ﬁnd that on average, labeling a feature takes much less time than labeling a document. We devise an algorithm that interleaves labeling features and documents which signiﬁcantly accelerates standard active learning in our simulation experiments. Feature feedback can complement traditional active learning in applications such as news ﬁltering, e-mail classiﬁcation, and personalization, where the human teacher can have signiﬁcant knowledge on the relevance of features.

<p>Author: Fu Chang, Chin-Chin Lin, Chi-Jen Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a number of adaptive prototype learning (APL) algorithms. They employ the same algorithmic scheme to determine the number and location of prototypes, but differ in the use of samples or the weighted averages of samples as prototypes, and also in the assumption of distance measures. To understand these algorithms from a theoretical viewpoint, we address their convergence properties, as well as their consistency under certain conditions. We also present a soft version of APL, in which a non-zero training error is allowed in order to enhance the generalization power of the resultant classifier. Applying the proposed algorithms to twelve UCI benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that they outperform many instance-based learning algorithms, the k-nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machines in terms of average test accuracy.

<p>Author: Jing Zhou, Dean P. Foster, Robert A. Stine, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: In streamwise feature selection, new features are sequentially considered for addition to a predictive model. When the space of potential features is large, streamwise feature selection offers many advantages over traditional feature selection methods, which assume that all features are known in advance. Features can be generated dynamically, focusing the search for new features on promising subspaces, and overﬁtting can be controlled by dynamically adjusting the threshold for adding features to the model. In contrast to traditional forward feature selection algorithms such as stepwise regression in which at each step all possible features are evaluated and the best one is selected, streamwise feature selection only evaluates each feature once when it is generated. We describe information-investing and α-investing, two adaptive complexity penalty methods for streamwise feature selection which dynamically adjust the threshold on the error reduction required for adding a new feature. These two methods give false discovery rate style guarantees against overﬁtting. They differ from standard penalty methods such as AIC, BIC and RIC, which always drastically over- or under-ﬁt in the limit of inﬁnite numbers of non-predictive features. Empirical results show that streamwise regression is competitive with (on small data sets) and superior to (on large data sets) much more compute-intensive feature selection methods such as stepwise regression, and allows feature selection on problems with millions of potential features.

<p>Author: Guillaume Lecué</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we prove the optimality of an aggregation procedure. We prove lower bounds for aggregation of model selection type of M density estimators for the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL), the Hellinger’s distance and the L1 -distance. The lower bound, with respect to the KL distance, can be achieved by the on-line type estimate suggested, among others, by Yang (2000a). Combining these results, we state that log M/n is an optimal rate of aggregation in the sense of Tsybakov (2003), where n is the sample size.

<p>Author: Peter Bühlmann, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: We propose Sparse Boosting (the SparseL2 Boost algorithm), a variant on boosting with the squared error loss. SparseL2 Boost yields sparser solutions than the previously proposed L2 Boosting by minimizing some penalized L2 -loss functions, the FPE model selection criteria, through smallstep gradient descent. Although boosting may give already relatively sparse solutions, for example corresponding to the soft-thresholding estimator in orthogonal linear models, there is sometimes a desire for more sparseness to increase prediction accuracy and ability for better variable selection: such goals can be achieved with SparseL2 Boost. We prove an equivalence of SparseL2 Boost to Breiman’s nonnegative garrote estimator for orthogonal linear models and demonstrate the generic nature of SparseL2 Boost for nonparametric interaction modeling. For an automatic selection of the tuning parameter in SparseL2 Boost we propose to employ the gMDL model selection criterion which can also be used for early stopping of L2 Boosting. Consequently, we can select between SparseL2 Boost and L2 Boosting by comparing their gMDL scores.

<p>Author: Andrea Caponnetto, Alexander Rakhlin</p><p>Abstract: We study some stability properties of algorithms which minimize (or almost-minimize) empirical error over Donsker classes of functions. We show that, as the number n of samples grows, the L 2 1 diameter of the set of almost-minimizers of empirical error with tolerance ξ(n) = o(n − 2 ) converges to zero in probability. Hence, even in the case of multiple minimizers of expected error, as n increases it becomes less and less likely that adding a sample (or a number of samples) to the training set will result in a large jump to a new hypothesis. Moreover, under some assumptions on the entropy of the class, along with an assumption of Komlos-Major-Tusnady type, we derive a power rate of decay for the diameter of almost-minimizers. This rate, through an application of a uniform ratio limit inequality, is shown to govern the closeness of the expected errors of the almost-minimizers. In fact, under the above assumptions, the expected errors of almost-minimizers become closer with a rate strictly faster than n−1/2 .

<p>Author: Paul W. Goldberg</p><p>Abstract: A classical approach in multi-class pattern classiﬁcation is the following. Estimate the probability distributions that generated the observations for each label class, and then label new instances by applying the Bayes classiﬁer to the estimated distributions. That approach provides more useful information than just a class label; it also provides estimates of the conditional distribution of class labels, in situations where there is class overlap. We would like to know whether it is harder to build accurate classiﬁers via this approach, than by techniques that may process all data with distinct labels together. In this paper we make that question precise by considering it in the context of PAC learnability. We propose two restrictions on the PAC learning framework that are intended to correspond with the above approach, and consider their relationship with standard PAC learning. Our main restriction of interest leads to some interesting algorithms that show that the restriction is not stronger (more restrictive) than various other well-known restrictions on PAC learning. An alternative slightly milder restriction turns out to be almost equivalent to unrestricted PAC learning.

<p>Author: Régis Vert, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We determine the asymptotic behaviour of the function computed by support vector machines (SVM) and related algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical convex loss function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian RBF kernel, in the situation where the number of examples tends to inﬁnity, the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel tends to 0, and the regularization parameter is held ﬁxed. Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the ﬁrst time to be a consistent density level set estimator.

<p>Author: Kristin P. Bennett, Emilio Parrado-Hernández</p><p>Abstract: The ﬁelds of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semideﬁnite, and semi-inﬁnite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for speciﬁc classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.

<p>Author: Tobias Glasmachers, Christian Igel</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines are trained by solving constrained quadratic optimization problems. This is usually done with an iterative decomposition algorithm operating on a small working set of variables in every iteration. The training time strongly depends on the selection of these variables. We propose the maximum-gain working set selection algorithm for large scale quadratic programming. It is based on the idea to greedily maximize the progress in each single iteration. The algorithm takes second order information from cached kernel matrix entries into account. We prove the convergence to an optimal solution of a variant termed hybrid maximum-gain working set selection. This method is empirically compared to the prominent most violating pair selection and the latest algorithm using second order information. For large training sets our new selection scheme is signiﬁcantly faster.

<p>Author: Peter J. Bickel, Ya'acov Ritov, Alon Zakai</p><p>Abstract: We give a review of various aspects of boosting, clarifying the issues through a few simple results, and relate our work and that of others to the minimax paradigm of statistics. We consider the population version of the boosting algorithm and prove its convergence to the Bayes classiﬁer as a corollary of a general result about Gauss-Southwell optimization in Hilbert space. We then investigate the algorithmic convergence of the sample version, and give bounds to the time until perfect separation of the sample. We conclude by some results on the statistical optimality of the L2 boosting.

<p>Author: Guillaume Lecué</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we prove the optimality of an aggregation procedure. We prove lower bounds for aggregation of model selection type of M density estimators for the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL), the Hellinger’s distance and the L1 -distance. The lower bound, with respect to the KL distance, can be achieved by the on-line type estimate suggested, among others, by Yang (2000a). Combining these results, we state that log M/n is an optimal rate of aggregation in the sense of Tsybakov (2003), where n is the sample size.

<p>Author: Luca Zanni, Thomas Serafini, Gaetano Zanghirati</p><p>Abstract: Parallel software for solving the quadratic program arising in training support vector machines for classiﬁcation problems is introduced. The software implements an iterative decomposition technique and exploits both the storage and the computing resources available on multiprocessor systems, by distributing the heaviest computational tasks of each decomposition iteration. Based on a wide range of recent theoretical advances, relevant decomposition issues, such as the quadratic subproblem solution, the gradient updating, the working set selection, are systematically described and their careful combination to get an effective parallel tool is discussed. A comparison with state-ofthe-art packages on benchmark problems demonstrates the good accuracy and the remarkable time saving achieved by the proposed software. Furthermore, challenging experiments on real-world data sets with millions training samples highlight how the software makes large scale standard nonlinear support vector machines effectively tractable on common multiprocessor systems. This feature is not shown by any of the available codes.

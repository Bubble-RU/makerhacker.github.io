<p>Author: Gilles Blanchard, Motoaki Kawanabe, Masashi Sugiyama, Vladimir Spokoiny, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Finding non-Gaussian components of high-dimensional data is an important preprocessing step for efﬁcient information processing. This article proposes a new linear method to identify the “nonGaussian subspace” within a very general semi-parametric framework. Our proposed method, called NGCA (non-Gaussian component analysis), is based on a linear operator which, to any arbitrary nonlinear (smooth) function, associates a vector belonging to the low dimensional nonGaussian target subspace, up to an estimation error. By applying this operator to a family of different nonlinear functions, one obtains a family of different vectors lying in a vicinity of the target space. As a ﬁnal step, the target space itself is estimated by applying PCA to this family of vectors. We show that this procedure is consistent in the sense that the estimaton error tends to zero at a parametric rate, uniformly over the family, Numerical examples demonstrate the usefulness of our method.</p><p>3 0.089137934 <a title="73-tfidf-3" href="./jmlr-2006-Geometric_Variance_Reduction_in_Markov_Chains%3A_Application_to_Value_Function_and_Gradient_Estimation.html">35 jmlr-2006-Geometric Variance Reduction in Markov Chains: Application to Value Function and Gradient Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We study a variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo estimation of functionals in Markov chains. The method is based on designing sequential control variates using successive approximations of the function of interest V . Regular Monte Carlo estimates have a variance of O(1/N), where N is the number of sample trajectories of the Markov chain. Here, we obtain a geometric variance reduction O(ρN ) (with ρ < 1) up to a threshold that depends on the approximation error V − A V , where A is an approximation operator linear in the values. Thus, if V belongs to the right approximation space (i.e. A V = V ), the variance decreases geometrically to zero. An immediate application is value function estimation in Markov chains, which may be used for policy evaluation in a policy iteration algorithm for solving Markov Decision Processes. Another important domain, for which variance reduction is highly needed, is gradient estimation, that is computing the sensitivity ∂αV of the performance measure V with respect to some parameter α of the transition probabilities. For example, in policy parametric optimization, computing an estimate of the policy gradient is required to perform a gradient optimization method. We show that, using two approximations for the value function and the gradient, a geometric variance reduction is also achieved, up to a threshold that depends on the approximation errors of both of those representations.</p><p>4 0.084466957 <a title="73-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2006-Stability_Properties_of_Empirical_Risk_Minimization_over_Donsker_Classes.html">84 jmlr-2006-Stability Properties of Empirical Risk Minimization over Donsker Classes</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Caponnetto, Alexander Rakhlin</p><p>Abstract: We study some stability properties of algorithms which minimize (or almost-minimize) empirical error over Donsker classes of functions. We show that, as the number n of samples grows, the L 2 1 diameter of the set of almost-minimizers of empirical error with tolerance ξ(n) = o(n − 2 ) converges to zero in probability. Hence, even in the case of multiple minimizers of expected error, as n increases it becomes less and less likely that adding a sample (or a number of samples) to the training set will result in a large jump to a new hypothesis. Moreover, under some assumptions on the entropy of the class, along with an assumption of Komlos-Major-Tusnady type, we derive a power rate of decay for the diameter of almost-minimizers. This rate, through an application of a uniform ratio limit inequality, is shown to govern the closeness of the expected errors of the almost-minimizers. In fact, under the above assumptions, the expected errors of almost-minimizers become closer with a rate strictly faster than n−1/2 .

Namely, under the assumption of conditional independence and identical distribution of objects, while the only assumption on the distribution of labels is that the rate of occurrence of each label should be above some positive threshold. We ﬁnd a broad class of learning algorithms for which estimations of the probability of the classiﬁcation error achieved under the classical i.i.d. assumption can be generalized to the similar estimates for case of conditionally i.i.d. examples.</p><p>2 0.598643 <a title="73-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2006-A_Scoring_Function_for_Learning_Bayesian_Networks_based_on_Mutual_Information_and_Conditional_Independence_Tests.html">6 jmlr-2006-A Scoring Function for Learning Bayesian Networks based on Mutual Information and Conditional Independence Tests</a></p>
<p>Author: Luis M. de Campos</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new scoring function for learning Bayesian networks from data using score+search algorithms. This is based on the concept of mutual information and exploits some well-known properties of this measure in a novel way. Essentially, a statistical independence test based on the chi-square distribution, associated with the mutual information measure, together with a property of additive decomposition of this measure, are combined in order to measure the degree of interaction between each variable and its parent variables in the network. The result is a non-Bayesian scoring function called MIT (mutual information tests) which belongs to the family of scores based on information theory. The MIT score also represents a penalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probability distributions associated with a candidate network and with the available data set. Detailed results of a complete experimental evaluation of the proposed scoring function and its comparison with the well-known K2, BDeu and BIC/MDL scores are also presented.

<p>Author: Kazuho Watanabe, Sumio Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian learning has been widely used and proved to be effective in many data modeling problems. However, computations involved in it require huge costs and generally cannot be performed exactly. The variational Bayesian approach, proposed as an approximation of Bayesian learning, has provided computational tractability and good generalization performance in many applications. The properties and capabilities of variational Bayesian learning itself have not been clariﬁed yet. It is still unknown how good approximation the variational Bayesian approach can achieve. In this paper, we discuss variational Bayesian learning of Gaussian mixture models and derive upper and lower bounds of variational stochastic complexities. The variational stochastic complexity, which corresponds to the minimum variational free energy and a lower bound of the Bayesian evidence, not only becomes important in addressing the model selection problem, but also enables us to discuss the accuracy of the variational Bayesian approach as an approximation of true Bayesian learning.

<p>Author: Clayton D. Scott, Robert D. Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Given a probability measure P and a reference measure µ, one is often interested in the minimum µ-measure set with P-measure at least α. Minimum volume sets of this type summarize the regions of greatest probability mass of P, and are useful for detecting anomalies and constructing conﬁdence regions. This paper addresses the problem of estimating minimum volume sets based on independent samples distributed according to P. Other than these samples, no other information is available regarding P, but the reference measure µ is assumed to be known. We introduce rules for estimating minimum volume sets that parallel the empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization principles in classiﬁcation. As in classiﬁcation, we show that the performances of our estimators are controlled by the rate of uniform convergence of empirical to true probabilities over the class from which the estimator is drawn. Thus we obtain ﬁnite sample size performance bounds in terms of VC dimension and related quantities. We also demonstrate strong universal consistency, an oracle inequality, and rates of convergence. The proposed estimators are illustrated with histogram and decision tree set estimation rules.

<p>Author: Janez Demšar</p><p>Abstract: While methods for comparing two learning algorithms on a single data set have been scrutinized for quite some time already, the issue of statistical tests for comparisons of more algorithms on multiple data sets, which is even more essential to typical machine learning studies, has been all but ignored. This article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classiﬁers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classiﬁers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classiﬁers over multiple data sets. Results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD (critical difference) diagrams.

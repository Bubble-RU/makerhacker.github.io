<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: Consider the problem of joint parameter estimation and prediction in a Markov random ﬁeld: that is, the model parameters are estimated on the basis of an initial set of data, and then the ﬁtted model is used to perform prediction (e.g., smoothing, denoising, interpolation) on a new noisy observation. Working under the restriction of limited computation, we analyze a joint method in which the same convex variational relaxation is used to construct an M-estimator for ﬁtting parameters, and to perform approximate marginalization for the prediction step. The key result of this paper is that in the computation-limited setting, using an inconsistent parameter estimator (i.e., an estimator that returns the “wrong” model even in the inﬁnite data limit) is provably beneﬁcial, since the resulting errors can partially compensate for errors made by using an approximate prediction technique. En route to this result, we analyze the asymptotic properties of M-estimators based on convex variational relaxations, and establish a Lipschitz stability property that holds for a broad class of convex variational methods. This stability result provides additional incentive, apart from the obvious beneﬁt of unique global optima, for using message-passing methods based on convex variational relaxations. We show that joint estimation/prediction based on the reweighted sum-product algorithm substantially outperforms a commonly used heuristic based on ordinary sum-product.

<p>Author: Tobias Glasmachers, Christian Igel</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines are trained by solving constrained quadratic optimization problems. This is usually done with an iterative decomposition algorithm operating on a small working set of variables in every iteration. The training time strongly depends on the selection of these variables. We propose the maximum-gain working set selection algorithm for large scale quadratic programming. It is based on the idea to greedily maximize the progress in each single iteration. The algorithm takes second order information from cached kernel matrix entries into account. We prove the convergence to an optimal solution of a variant termed hybrid maximum-gain working set selection. This method is empirically compared to the prominent most violating pair selection and the latest algorithm using second order information. For large training sets our new selection scheme is signiﬁcantly faster.

<p>Author: Andrea Caponnetto, Alexander Rakhlin</p><p>Abstract: We study some stability properties of algorithms which minimize (or almost-minimize) empirical error over Donsker classes of functions. We show that, as the number n of samples grows, the L 2 1 diameter of the set of almost-minimizers of empirical error with tolerance ξ(n) = o(n − 2 ) converges to zero in probability. Hence, even in the case of multiple minimizers of expected error, as n increases it becomes less and less likely that adding a sample (or a number of samples) to the training set will result in a large jump to a new hypothesis. Moreover, under some assumptions on the entropy of the class, along with an assumption of Komlos-Major-Tusnady type, we derive a power rate of decay for the diameter of almost-minimizers. This rate, through an application of a uniform ratio limit inequality, is shown to govern the closeness of the expected errors of the almost-minimizers. In fact, under the above assumptions, the expected errors of almost-minimizers become closer with a rate strictly faster than n−1/2 .

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun</p><p>Abstract: The eigenvalues of the kernel matrix play an important role in a number of kernel methods, in particular, in kernel principal component analysis. It is well known that the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix converge as the number of samples tends to inﬁnity. We derive probabilistic ﬁnite sample size bounds on the approximation error of individual eigenvalues which have the important property that the bounds scale with the eigenvalue under consideration, reﬂecting the actual behavior of the approximation errors as predicted by asymptotic results and observed in numerical simulations. Such scaling bounds have so far only been known for tail sums of eigenvalues. Asymptotically, the bounds presented here have a slower than stochastic rate, but the number of sample points necessary to make this disadvantage noticeable is often unrealistically large. Therefore, under practical conditions, and for all but the largest few eigenvalues, the bounds presented here form a signiﬁcant improvement over existing non-scaling bounds.

<p>Author: Katya Scheinberg</p><p>Abstract: We propose an active set algorithm to solve the convex quadratic programming (QP) problem which is the core of the support vector machine (SVM) training. The underlying method is not new and is based on the extensive practice of the Simplex method and its variants for convex quadratic problems. However, its application to large-scale SVM problems is new. Until recently the traditional active set methods were considered impractical for large SVM problems. By adapting the methods to the special structure of SVM problems we were able to produce an efﬁcient implementation. We conduct an extensive study of the behavior of our method and its variations on SVM problems. We present computational results comparing our method with Joachims’ SVM light (see Joachims, 1999). The results show that our method has overall better performance on many SVM problems. It seems to have a particularly strong advantage on more difﬁcult problems. In addition this algorithm has better theoretical properties and it naturally extends to the incremental mode. Since the proposed method solves the standard SVM formulation, as does SVMlight , the generalization properties of these two approaches are identical and we do not discuss them in the paper.

<p>Author: Eyal Even-Dar, Shie Mannor, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We incorporate statistical conﬁdence intervals in both the multi-armed bandit and the reinforcement learning problems. In the bandit problem we show that given n arms, it sufﬁces to pull the arms a total of O (n/ε2 ) log(1/δ) times to ﬁnd an ε-optimal arm with probability of at least 1 − δ. This bound matches the lower bound of Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) up to constants. We also devise action elimination procedures in reinforcement learning algorithms. We describe a framework that is based on learning the conﬁdence interval around the value function or the Q-function and eliminating actions that are not optimal (with high probability). We provide a model-based and a model-free variants of the elimination method. We further derive stopping conditions guaranteeing that the learned policy is approximately optimal with high probability. Simulations demonstrate a considerable speedup and added robustness over ε-greedy Q-learning.</p><p>5 0.12006509 <a title="16-lsi-5" href="./jmlr-2006-Learning_Minimum_Volume_Sets.html">48 jmlr-2006-Learning Minimum Volume Sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Clayton D. Scott, Robert D. Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Given a probability measure P and a reference measure µ, one is often interested in the minimum µ-measure set with P-measure at least α. Minimum volume sets of this type summarize the regions of greatest probability mass of P, and are useful for detecting anomalies and constructing conﬁdence regions. This paper addresses the problem of estimating minimum volume sets based on independent samples distributed according to P. Other than these samples, no other information is available regarding P, but the reference measure µ is assumed to be known. We introduce rules for estimating minimum volume sets that parallel the empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization principles in classiﬁcation. As in classiﬁcation, we show that the performances of our estimators are controlled by the rate of uniform convergence of empirical to true probabilities over the class from which the estimator is drawn. Thus we obtain ﬁnite sample size performance bounds in terms of VC dimension and related quantities. We also demonstrate strong universal consistency, an oracle inequality, and rates of convergence. The proposed estimators are illustrated with histogram and decision tree set estimation rules.

The complexity penalty of multi-task learning is bounded by a simple expression involving the margins of the task-speciﬁc classiﬁers, the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the selected preprocessor and the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the covariance operator for the total mixture of all task distributions, or, alternatively, the Frobenius norm of the total Gramian matrix for the data-dependent version. The results can be compared to state-of-the-art results on linear single-task learning.

<p>Author: Clayton D. Scott, Robert D. Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Given a probability measure P and a reference measure µ, one is often interested in the minimum µ-measure set with P-measure at least α. Minimum volume sets of this type summarize the regions of greatest probability mass of P, and are useful for detecting anomalies and constructing conﬁdence regions. This paper addresses the problem of estimating minimum volume sets based on independent samples distributed according to P. Other than these samples, no other information is available regarding P, but the reference measure µ is assumed to be known. We introduce rules for estimating minimum volume sets that parallel the empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization principles in classiﬁcation. As in classiﬁcation, we show that the performances of our estimators are controlled by the rate of uniform convergence of empirical to true probabilities over the class from which the estimator is drawn. Thus we obtain ﬁnite sample size performance bounds in terms of VC dimension and related quantities. We also demonstrate strong universal consistency, an oracle inequality, and rates of convergence. The proposed estimators are illustrated with histogram and decision tree set estimation rules.

<p>Author: Régis Vert, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We determine the asymptotic behaviour of the function computed by support vector machines (SVM) and related algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical convex loss function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian RBF kernel, in the situation where the number of examples tends to inﬁnity, the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel tends to 0, and the regularization parameter is held ﬁxed. Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the ﬁrst time to be a consistent density level set estimator.

<p>Author: Dana Angluin, Jiang Chen</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a hypergraph using edge-detecting queries. In this model, the learner may query whether a set of vertices induces an edge of the hidden hypergraph or not. We show that an r-uniform hypergraph with m edges and n vertices is learnable with O(2 4r m · poly(r, log n)) queries with high probability. The queries can be made in O(min(2 r (log m + r)2 , (log m + r)3 )) rounds. We also give an algorithm that learns an almost uniform hypergraph of ∆ ∆ dimension r using O(2O((1+ 2 )r) · m1+ 2 · poly(log n)) queries with high probability, where ∆ is the difference between the maximum and the minimum edge sizes. This upper bound matches our ∆ lower bound of Ω(( m∆ )1+ 2 ) for this class of hypergraphs in terms of dependence on m. The 1+ 2 queries can also be made in O((1 + ∆) · min(2r (log m + r)2 , (log m + r)3 )) rounds.

<p>Author: Anders Bergkvist, Peter Damaschke,  Marcel Lüthi</p><p>Abstract: We consider an optimization problem in probabilistic inference: Given n hypotheses H j , m possible observations Ok , their conditional probabilities pk j , and a particular Ok , select a possibly small subset of hypotheses excluding the true target only with some error probability ε. After specifying the optimization goal we show that this problem can be solved through a linear program in mn variables that indicate the probabilities to discard a hypothesis given an observation. Moreover, we can compute optimal strategies where only O(m + n) of these variables get fractional values. The manageable size of the linear programs and the mostly deterministic shape of optimal strategies makes the method practicable. We interpret the dual variables as worst-case distributions of hypotheses, and we point out some counterintuitive nonmonotonic behaviour of the variables as a function of the error bound ε. One of the open problems is the existence of a purely combinatorial algorithm that is faster than generic linear programming.

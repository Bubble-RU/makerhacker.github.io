<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Luca Zaniboni</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of classifying data in a given taxonomy when classiﬁcations associated with multiple and/or partial paths are allowed. We introduce a new algorithm that incrementally learns a linear-threshold classiﬁer for each node of the taxonomy. A hierarchical classiﬁcation is obtained by evaluating the trained node classiﬁers in a top-down fashion. To evaluate classiﬁers in our multipath framework, we deﬁne a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, capturing the intuition that whenever a classiﬁcation mistake is made on a node of the taxonomy, then no loss should be charged for any additional mistake occurring in the subtree of that node. Making no assumptions on the mechanism generating the data instances, and assuming a linear noise model for the labels, we bound the H-loss of our on-line algorithm in terms of the H-loss of a reference classiﬁer knowing the true parameters of the label-generating process. We show that, in expectation, the excess cumulative H-loss grows at most logarithmically in the length of the data sequence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the precise dependence of the rate of convergence on the eigenstructure of the data each node observes.

<p>Author: Hichem Sahbi, Donald Geman</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a computational design for pattern detection based on a tree-structured network of support vector machines (SVMs). An SVM is associated with each cell in a recursive partitioning of the space of patterns (hypotheses) into increasingly ﬁner subsets. The hierarchy is traversed coarse-to-ﬁne and each chain of positive responses from the root to a leaf constitutes a detection. Our objective is to design and build a network which balances overall error and computation. Initially, SVMs are constructed for each cell with no constraints. This “free network” is then perturbed, cell by cell, into another network, which is “graded” in two ways: ﬁrst, the number of support vectors of each SVM is reduced (by clustering) in order to adjust to a pre-determined, increasing function of cell depth; second, the decision boundaries are shifted to preserve all positive responses from the original set of training data. The limits on the numbers of clusters (virtual support vectors) result from minimizing the mean computational cost of collecting all detections subject to a bound on the expected number of false positives. When applied to detecting faces in cluttered scenes, the patterns correspond to poses and the free network is already faster and more accurate than applying a single pose-speciﬁc SVM many times. The graded network promotes very rapid processing of background regions while maintaining the discriminatory power of the free network.

<p>Author: Kristin P. Bennett, Emilio Parrado-Hernández</p><p>Abstract: The ﬁelds of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semideﬁnite, and semi-inﬁnite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for speciﬁc classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.

<p>Author: S. V. N. Vishwanathan, Nicol N. Schraudolph, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an online support vector machine (SVM) that uses the stochastic meta-descent (SMD) algorithm to adapt its step size automatically. We formulate the online learning problem as a stochastic gradient descent in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and translate SMD to the nonparametric setting, where its gradient trace parameter is no longer a coefﬁcient vector but an element of the RKHS. We derive efﬁcient updates that allow us to perform the step size adaptation in linear time. We apply the online SVM framework to a variety of loss functions, and in particular show how to handle structured output spaces and achieve efﬁcient online multiclass classiﬁcation. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms more primitive methods for setting the gradient step size.

<p>Author: Eyal Even-Dar, Shie Mannor, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We incorporate statistical conﬁdence intervals in both the multi-armed bandit and the reinforcement learning problems. In the bandit problem we show that given n arms, it sufﬁces to pull the arms a total of O (n/ε2 ) log(1/δ) times to ﬁnd an ε-optimal arm with probability of at least 1 − δ. This bound matches the lower bound of Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) up to constants. We also devise action elimination procedures in reinforcement learning algorithms. We describe a framework that is based on learning the conﬁdence interval around the value function or the Q-function and eliminating actions that are not optimal (with high probability). We provide a model-based and a model-free variants of the elimination method. We further derive stopping conditions guaranteeing that the learned policy is approximately optimal with high probability. Simulations demonstrate a considerable speedup and added robustness over ε-greedy Q-learning.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.63925952 <a title="41-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2006-Kernel-Based_Learning_of_Hierarchical_Multilabel_Classification_Models_%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%28Special_Topic_on_Machine_Learning_and_Optimization%29.html">41 jmlr-2006-Kernel-Based Learning of Hierarchical Multilabel Classification Models     (Special Topic on Machine Learning and Optimization)</a></p>
<p>Author: Juho Rousu, Craig Saunders, Sandor Szedmak, John Shawe-Taylor</p><p>Abstract: We present a kernel-based algorithm for hierarchical text classiﬁcation where the documents are allowed to belong to more than one category at a time. The classiﬁcation model is a variant of the Maximum Margin Markov Network framework, where the classiﬁcation hierarchy is represented as a Markov tree equipped with an exponential family deﬁned on the edges. We present an efﬁcient optimization algorithm based on incremental conditional gradient ascent in single-example subspaces spanned by the marginal dual variables. The optimization is facilitated with a dynamic programming based algorithm that computes best update directions in the feasible set. Experiments show that the algorithm can feasibly optimize training sets of thousands of examples and classiﬁcation hierarchies consisting of hundreds of nodes. Training of the full hierarchical model is as efﬁcient as training independent SVM-light classiﬁers for each node. The algorithm’s predictive accuracy was found to be competitive with other recently introduced hierarchical multicategory or multilabel classiﬁcation learning algorithms.

<p>Author: Jelle R. Kok, Nikos Vlassis</p><p>Abstract: In this article we describe a set of scalable techniques for learning the behavior of a group of agents in a collaborative multiagent setting. As a basis we use the framework of coordination graphs of Guestrin, Koller, and Parr (2002a) which exploits the dependencies between agents to decompose the global payoff function into a sum of local terms. First, we deal with the single-state case and describe a payoff propagation algorithm that computes the individual actions that approximately maximize the global payoff function. The method can be viewed as the decision-making analogue of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Second, we focus on learning the behavior of the agents in sequential decision-making tasks. We introduce different model-free reinforcementlearning techniques, unitedly called Sparse Cooperative Q-learning, which approximate the global action-value function based on the topology of a coordination graph, and perform updates using the contribution of the individual agents to the maximal global action value. The combined use of an edge-based decomposition of the action-value function and the payoff propagation algorithm for efﬁcient action selection, result in an approach that scales only linearly in the problem size. We provide experimental evidence that our method outperforms related multiagent reinforcement-learning methods based on temporal differences.

<p>Author: Anders Jonsson, Andrew Barto</p><p>Abstract: We present Variable Inﬂuence Structure Analysis, or VISA, an algorithm that performs hierarchical decomposition of factored Markov decision processes. VISA uses a dynamic Bayesian network model of actions, and constructs a causal graph that captures relationships between state variables. In tasks with sparse causal graphs VISA exploits structure by introducing activities that cause the values of state variables to change. The result is a hierarchy of activities that together represent a solution to the original task. VISA performs state abstraction for each activity by ignoring irrelevant state variables and lower-level activities. In addition, we describe an algorithm for constructing compact models of the activities introduced. State abstraction and compact activity models enable VISA to apply efﬁcient algorithms to solve the stand-alone subtask associated with each activity. Experimental results show that the decomposition introduced by VISA can signiﬁcantly accelerate construction of an optimal, or near-optimal, policy.

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Luca Zaniboni</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of classifying data in a given taxonomy when classiﬁcations associated with multiple and/or partial paths are allowed. We introduce a new algorithm that incrementally learns a linear-threshold classiﬁer for each node of the taxonomy. A hierarchical classiﬁcation is obtained by evaluating the trained node classiﬁers in a top-down fashion. To evaluate classiﬁers in our multipath framework, we deﬁne a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, capturing the intuition that whenever a classiﬁcation mistake is made on a node of the taxonomy, then no loss should be charged for any additional mistake occurring in the subtree of that node. Making no assumptions on the mechanism generating the data instances, and assuming a linear noise model for the labels, we bound the H-loss of our on-line algorithm in terms of the H-loss of a reference classiﬁer knowing the true parameters of the label-generating process. We show that, in expectation, the excess cumulative H-loss grows at most logarithmically in the length of the data sequence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the precise dependence of the rate of convergence on the eigenstructure of the data each node observes. Our theoretical results are complemented by a number of experiments on texual corpora. In these experiments we show that, after only one epoch of training, our algorithm performs much better than Perceptron-based hierarchical classiﬁers, and reasonably close to a hierarchical support vector machine.

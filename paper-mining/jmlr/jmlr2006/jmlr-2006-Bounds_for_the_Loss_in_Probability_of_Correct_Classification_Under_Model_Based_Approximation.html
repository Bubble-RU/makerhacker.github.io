<p>Author: Luis M. de Campos</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new scoring function for learning Bayesian networks from data using score+search algorithms. This is based on the concept of mutual information and exploits some well-known properties of this measure in a novel way. Essentially, a statistical independence test based on the chi-square distribution, associated with the mutual information measure, together with a property of additive decomposition of this measure, are combined in order to measure the degree of interaction between each variable and its parent variables in the network. The result is a non-Bayesian scoring function called MIT (mutual information tests) which belongs to the family of scores based on information theory. The MIT score also represents a penalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probability distributions associated with a candidate network and with the available data set. Detailed results of a complete experimental evaluation of the proposed scoring function and its comparison with the well-known K2, BDeu and BIC/MDL scores are also presented.

<p>Author: Kazuho Watanabe, Sumio Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian learning has been widely used and proved to be effective in many data modeling problems. However, computations involved in it require huge costs and generally cannot be performed exactly. The variational Bayesian approach, proposed as an approximation of Bayesian learning, has provided computational tractability and good generalization performance in many applications. The properties and capabilities of variational Bayesian learning itself have not been clariﬁed yet. It is still unknown how good approximation the variational Bayesian approach can achieve. In this paper, we discuss variational Bayesian learning of Gaussian mixture models and derive upper and lower bounds of variational stochastic complexities. The variational stochastic complexity, which corresponds to the minimum variational free energy and a lower bound of the Bayesian evidence, not only becomes important in addressing the model selection problem, but also enables us to discuss the accuracy of the variational Bayesian approach as an approximation of true Bayesian learning.

<p>Author: Pieter Abbeel, Daphne Koller, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We study the computational and sample complexity of parameter and structure learning in graphical models. Our main result shows that the class of factor graphs with bounded degree can be learned in polynomial time and from a polynomial number of training examples, assuming that the data is generated by a network in this class. This result covers both parameter estimation for a known network structure and structure learning. It implies as a corollary that we can learn factor graphs for both Bayesian networks and Markov networks of bounded degree, in polynomial time and sample complexity. Importantly, unlike standard maximum likelihood estimation algorithms, our method does not require inference in the underlying network, and so applies to networks where inference is intractable. We also show that the error of our learned model degrades gracefully when the generating distribution is not a member of the target class of networks. In addition to our main result, we show that the sample complexity of parameter learning in graphical models has an O(1) dependence on the number of variables in the model when using the KL-divergence normalized by the number of variables as the performance criterion.1 Keywords: probabilistic graphical models, parameter and structure learning, factor graphs, Markov networks, Bayesian networks</p><p>5 0.049276661 <a title="17-tfidf-5" href="./jmlr-2006-Maximum-Gain_Working_Set_Selection_for_SVMs_%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%28Special_Topic_on_Machine_Learning_and_Optimization%29.html">61 jmlr-2006-Maximum-Gain Working Set Selection for SVMs     (Special Topic on Machine Learning and Optimization)</a></p>
<p>Author: Tobias Glasmachers, Christian Igel</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines are trained by solving constrained quadratic optimization problems. This is usually done with an iterative decomposition algorithm operating on a small working set of variables in every iteration. The training time strongly depends on the selection of these variables. We propose the maximum-gain working set selection algorithm for large scale quadratic programming. It is based on the idea to greedily maximize the progress in each single iteration. The algorithm takes second order information from cached kernel matrix entries into account. We prove the convergence to an optimal solution of a variant termed hybrid maximum-gain working set selection. This method is empirically compared to the prominent most violating pair selection and the latest algorithm using second order information. For large training sets our new selection scheme is signiﬁcantly faster.

Similar formulations are also derived for designing regression functions which are robust to uncertainties in the regression setting. The proposed formulations are independent of the underlying distribution, requiring only the existence of second order moments. These formulations are then specialized to the case of missing values in observations for both classiﬁcation and regression problems.

<p>Author: David A. Ross, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Many perceptual models and theories hinge on treating objects as a collection of constituent parts. When applying these approaches to data, a fundamental problem arises: how can we determine what are the parts? We attack this problem using learning, proposing a form of generative latent factor model, in which each data dimension is allowed to select a different factor or part as its explanation. This approach permits a range of variations that posit different models for the appearance of a part. Here we provide the details for two such models: a discrete and a continuous one. Further, we show that this latent factor model can be extended hierarchically to account for correlations between the appearances of different parts. This permits modeling of data consisting of multiple categories, and learning these categories simultaneously with the parts when they are unobserved. Experiments demonstrate the ability to learn parts-based representations, and categories, of facial images and user-preference data.

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering refers to a class of techniques which rely on the eigenstructure of a similarity matrix to partition points into disjoint clusters, with points in the same cluster having high similarity and points in different clusters having low similarity. In this paper, we derive new cost functions for spectral clustering based on measures of error between a given partition and a solution of the spectral relaxation of a minimum normalized cut problem. Minimizing these cost functions with respect to the partition leads to new spectral clustering algorithms. Minimizing with respect to the similarity matrix leads to algorithms for learning the similarity matrix from fully labelled data sets. We apply our learning algorithm to the blind one-microphone speech separation problem, casting the problem as one of segmentation of the spectrogram.

<p>Author: Magnus Ekdahl, Timo Koski</p><p>Abstract: In many pattern recognition/classiﬁcation problem the true class conditional model and class probabilities are approximated for reasons of reducing complexity and/or of statistical estimation. The approximated classiﬁer is expected to have worse performance, here measured by the probability of correct classiﬁcation. We present an analysis valid in general, and easily computable formulas for estimating the degradation in probability of correct classiﬁcation when compared to the optimal classiﬁer. An example of an approximation is the Na¨ve Bayes classiﬁer. We show that the perforı mance of the Na¨ve Bayes depends on the degree of functional dependence between the features ı and labels. We provide a sufﬁcient condition for zero loss of performance, too.

<p>Author: Tomáš Šingliar, Miloš Hauskrecht</p><p>Abstract: We develop a new component analysis framework, the Noisy-Or Component Analyzer (NOCA), that targets high-dimensional binary data. NOCA is a probabilistic latent variable model that assumes the expression of observed high-dimensional binary data is driven by a small number of hidden binary sources combined via noisy-or units. The component analysis procedure is equivalent to learning of NOCA parameters. Since the classical EM formulation of the NOCA learning problem is intractable, we develop its variational approximation. We test the NOCA framework on two problems: (1) a synthetic image-decomposition problem and (2) a co-citation data analysis problem for thousands of CiteSeer documents. We demonstrate good performance of the new model on both problems. In addition, we contrast the model to two mixture-based latent-factor models: the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Differing assumptions underlying these models cause them to discover different types of structure in co-citation data, thus illustrating the beneﬁt of NOCA in building our understanding of highdimensional data sets.

<p>Author: Sharlee Climer, Weixiong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Given a matrix of values in which the rows correspond to objects and the columns correspond to features of the objects, rearrangement clustering is the problem of rearranging the rows of the matrix such that the sum of the similarities between adjacent rows is maximized. Referred to by various names and reinvented several times, this clustering technique has been extensively used in many ﬁelds over the last three decades. In this paper, we point out two critical pitfalls that have been previously overlooked. The ﬁrst pitfall is deleterious when rearrangement clustering is applied to objects that form natural clusters. The second concerns a similarity metric that is commonly used. We present an algorithm that overcomes these pitfalls. This algorithm is based on a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem. It offers an extra beneﬁt as it automatically determines cluster boundaries. Using this algorithm, we optimally solve four benchmark problems and a 2,467-gene expression data clustering problem. As expected, our new algorithm identiﬁes better clusters than those found by previous approaches in all ﬁve cases. Overall, our results demonstrate the beneﬁts of rectifying the pitfalls and exemplify the usefulness of this clustering technique. Our code is available at our websites.

<p>Author: Tijl De Bie, Nello Cristianini</p><p>Abstract: The rise of convex programming has changed the face of many research ﬁelds in recent years, machine learning being one of the ones that beneﬁtted the most. A very recent developement, the relaxation of combinatorial problems to semi-deﬁnite programs (SDP), has gained considerable attention over the last decade (Helmberg, 2000; De Bie and Cristianini, 2004a). Although SDP problems can be solved in polynomial time, for many relaxations the exponent in the polynomial complexity bounds is too high for scaling to large problem sizes. This has hampered their uptake as a powerful new tool in machine learning. In this paper, we present a new and fast SDP relaxation of the normalized graph cut problem, and investigate its usefulness in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. In particular, this provides a convex algorithm for transduction, as well as approaches to clustering. We further propose a whole cascade of fast relaxations that all hold the middle between older spectral relaxations and the new SDP relaxation, allowing one to trade oﬀ computational cost versus relaxation accuracy. Finally, we discuss how the methodology developed in this paper can be applied to other combinatorial problems in machine learning, and we treat the max-cut problem as an example.

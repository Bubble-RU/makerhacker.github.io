<p>Author: Nicolai Meinshausen</p><p>Abstract: Random forests were introduced as a machine learning tool in Breiman (2001) and have since proven to be very popular and powerful for high-dimensional regression and classiﬁcation. For regression, random forests give an accurate approximation of the conditional mean of a response variable. It is shown here that random forests provide information about the full conditional distribution of the response variable, not only about the conditional mean. Conditional quantiles can be inferred with quantile regression forests, a generalisation of random forests. Quantile regression forests give a non-parametric and accurate way of estimating conditional quantiles for high-dimensional predictor variables. The algorithm is shown to be consistent. Numerical examples suggest that the algorithm is competitive in terms of predictive power.

<p>Author: Pannagadatta K. Shivaswamy, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Alexander J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel second order cone programming formulation for designing robust classiﬁers which can handle uncertainty in observations. Similar formulations are also derived for designing regression functions which are robust to uncertainties in the regression setting. The proposed formulations are independent of the underlying distribution, requiring only the existence of second order moments. These formulations are then specialized to the case of missing values in observations for both classiﬁcation and regression problems. Experiments show that the proposed formulations outperform imputation.</p><p>4 0.046183556 <a title="65-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2006-Consistency_and_Convergence_Rates_of_One-Class_SVMs_and_Related_Algorithms.html">23 jmlr-2006-Consistency and Convergence Rates of One-Class SVMs and Related Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Régis Vert, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We determine the asymptotic behaviour of the function computed by support vector machines (SVM) and related algorithms that minimize a regularized empirical convex loss function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian RBF kernel, in the situation where the number of examples tends to inﬁnity, the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel tends to 0, and the regularization parameter is held ﬁxed. Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classiﬁcation error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the ﬁrst time to be a consistent density level set estimator.

<p>Author: Clayton D. Scott, Robert D. Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Given a probability measure P and a reference measure µ, one is often interested in the minimum µ-measure set with P-measure at least α. Minimum volume sets of this type summarize the regions of greatest probability mass of P, and are useful for detecting anomalies and constructing conﬁdence regions. This paper addresses the problem of estimating minimum volume sets based on independent samples distributed according to P. Other than these samples, no other information is available regarding P, but the reference measure µ is assumed to be known. We introduce rules for estimating minimum volume sets that parallel the empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization principles in classiﬁcation. As in classiﬁcation, we show that the performances of our estimators are controlled by the rate of uniform convergence of empirical to true probabilities over the class from which the estimator is drawn. Thus we obtain ﬁnite sample size performance bounds in terms of VC dimension and related quantities. We also demonstrate strong universal consistency, an oracle inequality, and rates of convergence. The proposed estimators are illustrated with histogram and decision tree set estimation rules.

<p>Author: Magnus Ekdahl, Timo Koski</p><p>Abstract: In many pattern recognition/classiﬁcation problem the true class conditional model and class probabilities are approximated for reasons of reducing complexity and/or of statistical estimation. The approximated classiﬁer is expected to have worse performance, here measured by the probability of correct classiﬁcation. We present an analysis valid in general, and easily computable formulas for estimating the degradation in probability of correct classiﬁcation when compared to the optimal classiﬁer. An example of an approximation is the Na¨ve Bayes classiﬁer. We show that the perforı mance of the Na¨ve Bayes depends on the degree of functional dependence between the features ı and labels. We provide a sufﬁcient condition for zero loss of performance, too.

Smola</p><p>Abstract: In regression, the desired estimate of y|x is not always given by a conditional mean, although this is most common. Sometimes one wants to obtain a good estimate that satisﬁes the property that a proportion, τ, of y|x, will be below the estimate. For τ = 0.5 this is an estimate of the median. What might be called median regression, is subsumed under the term quantile regression. We present a nonparametric version of a quantile estimator, which can be obtained by solving a simple quadratic programming problem and provide uniform convergence statements and bounds on the quantile property of our estimator. Experimental results show the feasibility of the approach and competitiveness of our method with existing ones. We discuss several types of extensions including an approach to solve the quantile crossing problems, as well as a method to incorporate prior qualitative knowledge such as monotonicity constraints.

<p>Author: Sayan Mukherjee, Qiang Wu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that simultaneously estimates a classiﬁcation function as well as its gradient in the supervised learning framework. The motivation for the algorithm is to ﬁnd salient variables and estimate how they covary. An efﬁcient implementation with respect to both memory and time is given. The utility of the algorithm is illustrated on simulated data as well as a gene expression data set. An error analysis is given for the convergence of the estimate of the classiﬁcation function and its gradient to the true classiﬁcation function and true gradient.

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, David Heckerman, Eric Horvitz</p><p>Abstract: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are a standard way to display the performance of a set of binary classiﬁers for all feasible ratios of the costs associated with false positives and false negatives. For linear classiﬁers, the set of classiﬁers is typically obtained by training once, holding constant the estimated slope and then varying the intercept to obtain a parameterized set of classiﬁers whose performances can be plotted in the ROC plane. We consider the alternative of varying the asymmetry of the cost function used for training. We show that the ROC curve obtained by varying both the intercept and the asymmetry, and hence the slope, always outperforms the ROC curve obtained by varying only the intercept. In addition, we present a path-following algorithm for the support vector machine (SVM) that can compute efﬁciently the entire ROC curve, and that has the same computational complexity as training a single classiﬁer. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the asymmetric cost model assumed when training a classiﬁer and the cost model assumed in applying the classiﬁer. In particular, we show that the mismatch between the step function used for testing and its convex upper bounds, usually used for training, leads to a provable and quantiﬁable difference around extreme asymmetries.

<p>Author: Clayton D. Scott, Robert D. Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Given a probability measure P and a reference measure µ, one is often interested in the minimum µ-measure set with P-measure at least α. Minimum volume sets of this type summarize the regions of greatest probability mass of P, and are useful for detecting anomalies and constructing conﬁdence regions. This paper addresses the problem of estimating minimum volume sets based on independent samples distributed according to P. Other than these samples, no other information is available regarding P, but the reference measure µ is assumed to be known. We introduce rules for estimating minimum volume sets that parallel the empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization principles in classiﬁcation. As in classiﬁcation, we show that the performances of our estimators are controlled by the rate of uniform convergence of empirical to true probabilities over the class from which the estimator is drawn. Thus we obtain ﬁnite sample size performance bounds in terms of VC dimension and related quantities. We also demonstrate strong universal consistency, an oracle inequality, and rates of convergence. The proposed estimators are illustrated with histogram and decision tree set estimation rules.

<p>Author: Ronan Collobert, Fabian Sinz, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou</p><p>Abstract: We show how the concave-convex procedure can be applied to transductive SVMs, which traditionally require solving a combinatorial search problem. This provides for the ﬁrst time a highly scalable algorithm in the nonlinear case. Detailed experiments verify the utility of our approach.

This paper considers a variety of types of domain knowledge for constraining parameter estimates when learning Bayesian networks.

<p>Author: Kazuho Watanabe, Sumio Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian learning has been widely used and proved to be effective in many data modeling problems. However, computations involved in it require huge costs and generally cannot be performed exactly. The variational Bayesian approach, proposed as an approximation of Bayesian learning, has provided computational tractability and good generalization performance in many applications. The properties and capabilities of variational Bayesian learning itself have not been clariﬁed yet. It is still unknown how good approximation the variational Bayesian approach can achieve. In this paper, we discuss variational Bayesian learning of Gaussian mixture models and derive upper and lower bounds of variational stochastic complexities. The variational stochastic complexity, which corresponds to the minimum variational free energy and a lower bound of the Bayesian evidence, not only becomes important in addressing the model selection problem, but also enables us to discuss the accuracy of the variational Bayesian approach as an approximation of true Bayesian learning.

<p>Author: Luis M. de Campos</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new scoring function for learning Bayesian networks from data using score+search algorithms. This is based on the concept of mutual information and exploits some well-known properties of this measure in a novel way. Essentially, a statistical independence test based on the chi-square distribution, associated with the mutual information measure, together with a property of additive decomposition of this measure, are combined in order to measure the degree of interaction between each variable and its parent variables in the network. The result is a non-Bayesian scoring function called MIT (mutual information tests) which belongs to the family of scores based on information theory. The MIT score also represents a penalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probability distributions associated with a candidate network and with the available data set. Detailed results of a complete experimental evaluation of the proposed scoring function and its comparison with the well-known K2, BDeu and BIC/MDL scores are also presented.

<p>Author: Kristin P. Bennett, Emilio Parrado-Hernández</p><p>Abstract: The ﬁelds of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semideﬁnite, and semi-inﬁnite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for speciﬁc classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.

<p>Author: Ben Taskar, Simon Lacoste-Julien, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple and scalable algorithm for maximum-margin estimation of structured output models, including an important class of Markov networks and combinatorial models. We formulate the estimation problem as a convex-concave saddle-point problem that allows us to use simple projection methods based on the dual extragradient algorithm (Nesterov, 2003). The projection step can be solved using dynamic programming or combinatorial algorithms for min-cost convex ﬂow, depending on the structure of the problem. We show that this approach provides a memoryefﬁcient alternative to formulations based on reductions to a quadratic program (QP). We analyze the convergence of the method and present experiments on two very different structured prediction tasks: 3D image segmentation and word alignment, illustrating the favorable scaling properties of our algorithm.1 Keywords: Markov networks, large-margin methods, structured prediction, extragradient, Bregman projections</p><p>6 0.056922622 <a title="15-tfidf-6" href="./jmlr-2006-Noisy-OR_Component_Analysis_and_its_Application_to_Link_Analysis.html">64 jmlr-2006-Noisy-OR Component Analysis and its Application to Link Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Tonatiuh Peña Centeno, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider a novel Bayesian interpretation of Fisher’s discriminant analysis. We relate Rayleigh’s coefﬁcient to a noise model that minimises a cost based on the most probable class centres and that abandons the ‘regression to the labels’ assumption used by other algorithms. Optimisation of the noise model yields a direction of discrimination equivalent to Fisher’s discriminant, and with the incorporation of a prior we can apply Bayes’ rule to infer the posterior distribution of the direction of discrimination. Nonetheless, we argue that an additional constraining distribution has to be included if sensible results are to be obtained. Going further, with the use of a Gaussian process prior we show the equivalence of our model to a regularised kernel Fisher’s discriminant. A key advantage of our approach is the facility to determine kernel parameters and the regularisation coefﬁcient through the optimisation of the marginal log-likelihood of the data. An added bonus of the new formulation is that it enables us to link the regularisation coefﬁcient with the generalisation error.</p><p>5 0.34092829 <a title="15-lsi-5" href="./jmlr-2006-Structured_Prediction%2C_Dual_Extragradient_and_Bregman_Projections_%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%28Special_Topic_on_Machine_Learning_and_Optimization%29.html">89 jmlr-2006-Structured Prediction, Dual Extragradient and Bregman Projections     (Special Topic on Machine Learning and Optimization)</a></p>

<p>Author: Radu Stefan Niculescu, Tom M. Mitchell, R. Bharat Rao</p><p>Abstract: The task of learning models for many real-world problems requires incorporating domain knowledge into learning algorithms, to enable accurate learning from a realistic volume of training data. This paper considers a variety of types of domain knowledge for constraining parameter estimates when learning Bayesian networks. In particular, we consider domain knowledge that constrains the values or relationships among subsets of parameters in a Bayesian network with known structure. We incorporate a wide variety of parameter constraints into learning procedures for Bayesian networks, by formulating this task as a constrained optimization problem. The assumptions made in module networks, dynamic Bayes nets and context speciﬁc independence models can be viewed as particular cases of such parameter constraints. We present closed form solutions or fast iterative algorithms for estimating parameters subject to several speciﬁc classes of parameter constraints, including equalities and inequalities among parameters, constraints on individual parameters, and constraints on sums and ratios of parameters, for discrete and continuous variables. Our methods cover learning from both frequentist and Bayesian points of view, from both complete and incomplete data. We present formal guarantees for our estimators, as well as methods for automatically learning useful parameter constraints from data. To validate our approach, we apply it to the domain of fMRI brain image analysis. Here we demonstrate the ability of our system to ﬁrst learn useful relationships among parameters, and then to use them to constrain the training of the Bayesian network, resulting in improved cross-validated accuracy of the learned model. Experiments on synthetic data are also presented. Keywords: Bayesian networks, constrained optimization, domain knowledge c 2006 Radu Stefan Niculescu, Tom Mitchell and Bharat Rao.

<p>Author: Jing Zhou, Dean P. Foster, Robert A. Stine, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: In streamwise feature selection, new features are sequentially considered for addition to a predictive model. When the space of potential features is large, streamwise feature selection offers many advantages over traditional feature selection methods, which assume that all features are known in advance. Features can be generated dynamically, focusing the search for new features on promising subspaces, and overﬁtting can be controlled by dynamically adjusting the threshold for adding features to the model. In contrast to traditional forward feature selection algorithms such as stepwise regression in which at each step all possible features are evaluated and the best one is selected, streamwise feature selection only evaluates each feature once when it is generated. We describe information-investing and α-investing, two adaptive complexity penalty methods for streamwise feature selection which dynamically adjust the threshold on the error reduction required for adding a new feature. These two methods give false discovery rate style guarantees against overﬁtting. They differ from standard penalty methods such as AIC, BIC and RIC, which always drastically over- or under-ﬁt in the limit of inﬁnite numbers of non-predictive features. Empirical results show that streamwise regression is competitive with (on small data sets) and superior to (on large data sets) much more compute-intensive feature selection methods such as stepwise regression, and allows feature selection on problems with millions of potential features.

<p>Author: Hema Raghavan, Omid Madani, Rosie Jones</p><p>Abstract: We extend the traditional active learning framework to include feedback on features in addition to labeling instances, and we execute a careful study of the effects of feature selection and human feedback on features in the setting of text categorization. Our experiments on a variety of categorization tasks indicate that there is signiﬁcant potential in improving classiﬁer performance by feature re-weighting, beyond that achieved via membership queries alone (traditional active learning) if we have access to an oracle that can point to the important (most predictive) features. Our experiments on human subjects indicate that human feedback on feature relevance can identify a sufﬁcient proportion of the most relevant features (over 50% in our experiments). We ﬁnd that on average, labeling a feature takes much less time than labeling a document. We devise an algorithm that interleaves labeling features and documents which signiﬁcantly accelerates standard active learning in our simulation experiments. Feature feedback can complement traditional active learning in applications such as news ﬁltering, e-mail classiﬁcation, and personalization, where the human teacher can have signiﬁcant knowledge on the relevance of features.

<p>Author: Josep M. Porta, Nikos Vlassis, Matthijs T.J. Spaan, Pascal Poupart</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to optimize Partially Observable Markov Decisions Processes (POMDPs) deﬁned on continuous spaces. To date, most algorithms for model-based POMDPs are restricted to discrete states, actions, and observations, but many real-world problems such as, for instance, robot navigation, are naturally deﬁned on continuous spaces. In this work, we demonstrate that the value function for continuous POMDPs is convex in the beliefs over continuous state spaces, and piecewise-linear convex for the particular case of discrete observations and actions but still continuous states. We also demonstrate that continuous Bellman backups are contracting and isotonic ensuring the monotonic convergence of value-iteration algorithms. Relying on those properties, we extend the P ERSEUS algorithm, originally developed for discrete POMDPs, to work in continuous state spaces by representing the observation, transition, and reward models using Gaussian mixtures, and the beliefs using Gaussian mixtures or particle sets. With these representations, the integrals that appear in the Bellman backup can be computed in closed form and, therefore, the algorithm is computationally feasible. Finally, we further extend P ERSEUS to deal with continuous action and observation sets by designing effective sampling approaches.

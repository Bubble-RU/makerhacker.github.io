<p>Author: Tonatiuh Peña Centeno, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider a novel Bayesian interpretation of Fisher’s discriminant analysis. We relate Rayleigh’s coefﬁcient to a noise model that minimises a cost based on the most probable class centres and that abandons the ‘regression to the labels’ assumption used by other algorithms. Optimisation of the noise model yields a direction of discrimination equivalent to Fisher’s discriminant, and with the incorporation of a prior we can apply Bayes’ rule to infer the posterior distribution of the direction of discrimination. Nonetheless, we argue that an additional constraining distribution has to be included if sensible results are to be obtained. Going further, with the use of a Gaussian process prior we show the equivalence of our model to a regularised kernel Fisher’s discriminant. A key advantage of our approach is the facility to determine kernel parameters and the regularisation coefﬁcient through the optimisation of the marginal log-likelihood of the data. An added bonus of the new formulation is that it enables us to link the regularisation coefﬁcient with the generalisation error.</p><p>3 0.071784899 <a title="1-tfidf-3" href="./jmlr-2006-Learning_Coordinate_Covariances_via_Gradients.html">45 jmlr-2006-Learning Coordinate Covariances via Gradients</a></p>

<p>Author: S.

To overcome this problem we devise a primal method with the following properties: (1) it decouples the idea of basis functions from the concept of support vectors; (2) it greedily ﬁnds a set of kernel basis functions of a speciﬁed maximum size (dmax ) to approximate the SVM primal cost function well; (3) it is 2 efﬁcient and roughly scales as O(ndmax ) where n is the number of training examples; and, (4) the number of basis functions it requires to achieve an accuracy close to the SVM accuracy is usually far less than the number of SVM support vectors.

<p>Author: Sören Sonnenburg, Gunnar Rätsch, Christin Schäfer, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: While classical kernel-based learning algorithms are based on a single kernel, in practice it is often desirable to use multiple kernels. Lanckriet et al. (2004) considered conic combinations of kernel matrices for classiﬁcation, leading to a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. We show that it can be rewritten as a semi-inﬁnite linear program that can be efﬁciently solved by recycling the standard SVM implementations. Moreover, we generalize the formulation and our method to a larger class of problems, including regression and one-class classiﬁcation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm works for hundred thousands of examples or hundreds of kernels to be combined, and helps for automatic model selection, improving the interpretability of the learning result. In a second part we discuss general speed up mechanism for SVMs, especially when used with sparse feature maps as appear for string kernels, allowing us to train a string kernel SVM on a 10 million real-world splice data set from computational biology. We integrated multiple kernel learning in our machine learning toolbox SHOGUN for which the source code is publicly available at http://www.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/raetsch/projects/shogun.

<p>Author: Juho Rousu, Craig Saunders, Sandor Szedmak, John Shawe-Taylor</p><p>Abstract: We present a kernel-based algorithm for hierarchical text classiﬁcation where the documents are allowed to belong to more than one category at a time. The classiﬁcation model is a variant of the Maximum Margin Markov Network framework, where the classiﬁcation hierarchy is represented as a Markov tree equipped with an exponential family deﬁned on the edges. We present an efﬁcient optimization algorithm based on incremental conditional gradient ascent in single-example subspaces spanned by the marginal dual variables. The optimization is facilitated with a dynamic programming based algorithm that computes best update directions in the feasible set. Experiments show that the algorithm can feasibly optimize training sets of thousands of examples and classiﬁcation hierarchies consisting of hundreds of nodes. Training of the full hierarchical model is as efﬁcient as training independent SVM-light classiﬁers for each node. The algorithm’s predictive accuracy was found to be competitive with other recently introduced hierarchical multicategory or multilabel classiﬁcation learning algorithms.

<p>Author: Mingrui Wu, Bernhard Schölkopf, Gökhan Bakır</p><p>Abstract: Many kernel learning algorithms, including support vector machines, result in a kernel machine, such as a kernel classiﬁer, whose key component is a weight vector in a feature space implicitly introduced by a positive deﬁnite kernel function. This weight vector is usually obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Based on this fact we present a direct method to build sparse kernel learning algorithms by adding one more constraint to the original convex optimization problem, such that the sparseness of the resulting kernel machine is explicitly controlled while at the same time performance is kept as high as possible. A gradient based approach is provided to solve this modiﬁed optimization problem. Applying this method to the support vectom machine results in a concrete algorithm for building sparse large margin classiﬁers. These classiﬁers essentially ﬁnd a discriminating subspace that can be spanned by a small number of vectors, and in this subspace, the diﬀerent classes of data are linearly well separated. Experimental results over several classiﬁcation benchmarks demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our approach.

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, David Heckerman, Eric Horvitz</p><p>Abstract: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are a standard way to display the performance of a set of binary classiﬁers for all feasible ratios of the costs associated with false positives and false negatives. For linear classiﬁers, the set of classiﬁers is typically obtained by training once, holding constant the estimated slope and then varying the intercept to obtain a parameterized set of classiﬁers whose performances can be plotted in the ROC plane. We consider the alternative of varying the asymmetry of the cost function used for training. We show that the ROC curve obtained by varying both the intercept and the asymmetry, and hence the slope, always outperforms the ROC curve obtained by varying only the intercept. In addition, we present a path-following algorithm for the support vector machine (SVM) that can compute efﬁciently the entire ROC curve, and that has the same computational complexity as training a single classiﬁer. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the asymmetric cost model assumed when training a classiﬁer and the cost model assumed in applying the classiﬁer. In particular, we show that the mismatch between the step function used for testing and its convex upper bounds, usually used for training, leads to a provable and quantiﬁable difference around extreme asymmetries.

<p>Author: Luis M. de Campos</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new scoring function for learning Bayesian networks from data using score+search algorithms. This is based on the concept of mutual information and exploits some well-known properties of this measure in a novel way. Essentially, a statistical independence test based on the chi-square distribution, associated with the mutual information measure, together with a property of additive decomposition of this measure, are combined in order to measure the degree of interaction between each variable and its parent variables in the network. The result is a non-Bayesian scoring function called MIT (mutual information tests) which belongs to the family of scores based on information theory. The MIT score also represents a penalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probability distributions associated with a candidate network and with the available data set. Detailed results of a complete experimental evaluation of the proposed scoring function and its comparison with the well-known K2, BDeu and BIC/MDL scores are also presented.

<p>Author: Sayan Mukherjee, Qiang Wu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that simultaneously estimates a classiﬁcation function as well as its gradient in the supervised learning framework. The motivation for the algorithm is to ﬁnd salient variables and estimate how they covary. An efﬁcient implementation with respect to both memory and time is given. The utility of the algorithm is illustrated on simulated data as well as a gene expression data set. An error analysis is given for the convergence of the estimate of the classiﬁcation function and its gradient to the true classiﬁcation function and true gradient.

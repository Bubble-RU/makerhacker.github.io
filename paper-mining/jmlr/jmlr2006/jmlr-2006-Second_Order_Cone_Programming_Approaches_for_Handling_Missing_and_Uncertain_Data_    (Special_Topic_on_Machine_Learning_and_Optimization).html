<p>Author: Kristin P. Bennett, Emilio Parrado-Hernández</p><p>Abstract: The ﬁelds of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semideﬁnite, and semi-inﬁnite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for speciﬁc classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.

<p>Author: Sayan Mukherjee, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that learns gradients from samples in the supervised learning framework. An error analysis is given for the convergence of the gradient estimated by the algorithm to the true gradient. The utility of the algorithm for the problem of variable selection as well as determining variable covariance is illustrated on simulated data as well as two gene expression data sets. For square loss we provide a very efﬁcient implementation with respect to both memory and time.

<p>Author: Sören Sonnenburg, Gunnar Rätsch, Christin Schäfer, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: While classical kernel-based learning algorithms are based on a single kernel, in practice it is often desirable to use multiple kernels. Lanckriet et al. (2004) considered conic combinations of kernel matrices for classiﬁcation, leading to a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. We show that it can be rewritten as a semi-inﬁnite linear program that can be efﬁciently solved by recycling the standard SVM implementations. Moreover, we generalize the formulation and our method to a larger class of problems, including regression and one-class classiﬁcation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm works for hundred thousands of examples or hundreds of kernels to be combined, and helps for automatic model selection, improving the interpretability of the learning result. In a second part we discuss general speed up mechanism for SVMs, especially when used with sparse feature maps as appear for string kernels, allowing us to train a string kernel SVM on a 10 million real-world splice data set from computational biology. We integrated multiple kernel learning in our machine learning toolbox SHOGUN for which the source code is publicly available at http://www.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/raetsch/projects/shogun.

<p>Author: Matthias Heiler, Christoph Schnörr</p><p>Abstract: We exploit the biconvex nature of the Euclidean non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) optimization problem to derive optimization schemes based on sequential quadratic and second order cone programming. We show that for ordinary NMF, our approach performs as well as existing stateof-the-art algorithms, while for sparsity-constrained NMF, as recently proposed by P. O. Hoyer in JMLR 5 (2004), it outperforms previous methods. In addition, we show how to extend NMF learning within the same optimization framework in order to make use of class membership information in supervised learning problems.

<p>Author: S. V. N. Vishwanathan, Nicol N. Schraudolph, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an online support vector machine (SVM) that uses the stochastic meta-descent (SMD) algorithm to adapt its step size automatically. We formulate the online learning problem as a stochastic gradient descent in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and translate SMD to the nonparametric setting, where its gradient trace parameter is no longer a coefﬁcient vector but an element of the RKHS. We derive efﬁcient updates that allow us to perform the step size adaptation in linear time. We apply the online SVM framework to a variety of loss functions, and in particular show how to handle structured output spaces and achieve efﬁcient online multiclass classiﬁcation. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms more primitive methods for setting the gradient step size.

<p>Author: Magnus Ekdahl, Timo Koski</p><p>Abstract: In many pattern recognition/classiﬁcation problem the true class conditional model and class probabilities are approximated for reasons of reducing complexity and/or of statistical estimation. The approximated classiﬁer is expected to have worse performance, here measured by the probability of correct classiﬁcation. We present an analysis valid in general, and easily computable formulas for estimating the degradation in probability of correct classiﬁcation when compared to the optimal classiﬁer. An example of an approximation is the Na¨ve Bayes classiﬁer. We show that the perforı mance of the Na¨ve Bayes depends on the degree of functional dependence between the features ı and labels. We provide a sufﬁcient condition for zero loss of performance, too.

<p>Author: Olvi L. Mangasarian</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines utilizing the 1-norm, typically set up as linear programs (Mangasarian, 2000; Bradley and Mangasarian, 1998), are formulated here as a completely unconstrained minimization of a convex differentiable piecewise-quadratic objective function in the dual space. The objective function, which has a Lipschitz continuous gradient and contains only one additional ﬁnite parameter, can be minimized by a generalized Newton method and leads to an exact solution of the support vector machine problem. The approach here is based on a formulation of a very general linear program as an unconstrained minimization problem and its application to support vector machine classiﬁcation problems. The present approach which generalizes both (Mangasarian, 2004) and (Fung and Mangasarian, 2004) is also applied to nonlinear approximation where a minimal number of nonlinear kernel functions are utilized to approximate a function from a given number of function values.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.90549314 <a title="79-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2006-Second_Order_Cone_Programming_Approaches_for_Handling_Missing_and_Uncertain_Data_%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%28Special_Topic_on_Machine_Learning_and_Optimization%29.html">79 jmlr-2006-Second Order Cone Programming Approaches for Handling Missing and Uncertain Data     (Special Topic on Machine Learning and Optimization)</a></p>
<p>Author: Pannagadatta K. Shivaswamy, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Alexander J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel second order cone programming formulation for designing robust classiﬁers which can handle uncertainty in observations. Similar formulations are also derived for designing regression functions which are robust to uncertainties in the regression setting. The proposed formulations are independent of the underlying distribution, requiring only the existence of second order moments. These formulations are then specialized to the case of missing values in observations for both classiﬁcation and regression problems. Experiments show that the proposed formulations outperform imputation.</p><p>3 0.8901965 <a title="79-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2006-Learning_Coordinate_Covariances_via_Gradients.html">45 jmlr-2006-Learning Coordinate Covariances via Gradients</a></p>
<p>Author: Sayan Mukherjee, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that learns gradients from samples in the supervised learning framework. An error analysis is given for the convergence of the gradient estimated by the algorithm to the true gradient. The utility of the algorithm for the problem of variable selection as well as determining variable covariance is illustrated on simulated data as well as two gene expression data sets. For square loss we provide a very efﬁcient implementation with respect to both memory and time.

<p>Author: Sayan Mukherjee, Qiang Wu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that simultaneously estimates a classiﬁcation function as well as its gradient in the supervised learning framework. The motivation for the algorithm is to ﬁnd salient variables and estimate how they covary. An efﬁcient implementation with respect to both memory and time is given. The utility of the algorithm is illustrated on simulated data as well as a gene expression data set. An error analysis is given for the convergence of the estimate of the classiﬁcation function and its gradient to the true classiﬁcation function and true gradient.

<p>Author: Seyoung Kim, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a general probabilistic framework for shape-based modeling and classiﬁcation of waveform data. A segmental hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to characterize waveform shape and shape variation is captured by adding random effects to the segmental model. The resulting probabilistic framework provides a basis for learning of waveform models from data as well as parsing and recognition of new waveforms. Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms are derived and investigated for ﬁtting such models to data. In particular, the “expectation conditional maximization either” (ECME) algorithm is shown to provide signiﬁcantly faster convergence than a standard EM procedure. Experimental results on two real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to improved accuracy in classiﬁcation and segmentation when compared to alternatives such as Euclidean distance matching, dynamic time warping, and segmental HMMs without random effects.

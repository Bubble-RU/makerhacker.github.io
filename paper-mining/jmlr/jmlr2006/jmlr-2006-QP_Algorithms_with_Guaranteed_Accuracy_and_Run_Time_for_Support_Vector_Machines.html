<h1>76 jmlr-2006-QP Algorithms with Guaranteed Accuracy and Run Time for Support Vector Machines</h1>

These algorithms employ a two–stage process where the ﬁrst stage produces an approximate solution to a dual QP problem and the second stage maps this approximate dual solution to an approximate primal solution. For the second stage we describe an O(n log n) algorithm that maps an √ √ approximate dual solution with accuracy (2 2Kn + 8 λ)−2 λε2 to an approximate primal solution p with accuracy ε p where n is the number of data samples, Kn is the maximum kernel value over the data and λ > 0 is the SVM regularization parameter. For the ﬁrst stage we present new results for decomposition algorithms and describe new decomposition algorithms with guaranteed accuracy and run time. In particular, for τ–rate certifying decomposition algorithms we establish the optimality of τ = 1/(n − 1). In addition we extend the recent τ = 1/(n − 1) algorithm of Simon (2004) to form two new composite algorithms that also achieve the τ = 1/(n − 1) iteration bound of List and Simon (2005), but yield faster run times in practice. We also exploit the τ–rate certifying property of these algorithms to produce new stopping rules that are computationally efﬁcient and that guarantee a speciﬁed accuracy for the approximate dual solution. Furthermore, for the dual QP problem corresponding to the standard classiﬁcation problem we describe operational conditions for which the Simon and composite algorithms possess an upper bound of O(n) on the number of iterations. For this same problem we also describe general conditions for which a matching lower bound exists for any decomposition algorithm that uses working sets of size 2.

<p>Author: Kristin P. Bennett, Emilio Parrado-Hernández</p><p>Abstract: The ﬁelds of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semideﬁnite, and semi-inﬁnite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for speciﬁc classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.

<p>Author: Ben Taskar, Simon Lacoste-Julien, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple and scalable algorithm for maximum-margin estimation of structured output models, including an important class of Markov networks and combinatorial models. We formulate the estimation problem as a convex-concave saddle-point problem that allows us to use simple projection methods based on the dual extragradient algorithm (Nesterov, 2003). The projection step can be solved using dynamic programming or combinatorial algorithms for min-cost convex ﬂow, depending on the structure of the problem. We show that this approach provides a memoryefﬁcient alternative to formulations based on reductions to a quadratic program (QP). We analyze the convergence of the method and present experiments on two very different structured prediction tasks: 3D image segmentation and word alignment, illustrating the favorable scaling properties of our algorithm.1 Keywords: Markov networks, large-margin methods, structured prediction, extragradient, Bregman projections</p><p>5 0.37270093 <a title="76-lsi-5" href="./jmlr-2006-Efficient_Learning_of_Label_Ranking_by_Soft_Projections_onto_Polyhedra_%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%28Special_Topic_on_Machine_Learning_and_Optimization%29.html">26 jmlr-2006-Efficient Learning of Label Ranking by Soft Projections onto Polyhedra     (Special Topic on Machine Learning and Optimization)</a></p>

<p>Author: Ron Begleiter, Ran El-Yaniv</p><p>Abstract: We present worst case bounds for the learning rate of a known prediction method that is based on hierarchical applications of binary context tree weighting (CTW) predictors. A heuristic application of this approach that relies on Huffman’s alphabet decomposition is known to achieve state-ofthe-art performance in prediction and lossless compression benchmarks. We show that our new bound for this heuristic is tighter than the best known performance guarantees for prediction and lossless compression algorithms in various settings. This result substantiates the efﬁciency of this hierarchical method and provides a compelling explanation for its practical success. In addition, we present the results of a few experiments that examine other possibilities for improving the multialphabet prediction performance of CTW-based algorithms.

<p>Author: Rasmus Kongsgaard Olsson, Lars Kai Hansen</p><p>Abstract: We apply a type of generative modelling to the problem of blind source separation in which prior knowledge about the latent source signals, such as time-varying auto-correlation and quasiperiodicity, are incorporated into a linear state-space model. In simulations, we show that in terms of signal-to-error ratio, the sources are inferred more accurately as a result of the inclusion of strong prior knowledge. We explore different schemes of maximum-likelihood optimization for the purpose of learning the model parameters. The Expectation Maximization algorithm, which is often considered the standard optimization method in this context, results in slow convergence when the noise variance is small. In such scenarios, quasi-Newton optimization yields substantial improvements in a range of signal to noise ratios. We analyze the performance of the methods on convolutive mixtures of speech signals.

<p>Author: Don Hush, Patrick Kelly, Clint Scovel, Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: We describe polynomial–time algorithms that produce approximate solutions with guaranteed accuracy for a class of QP problems that are used in the design of support vector machine classiﬁers. These algorithms employ a two–stage process where the ﬁrst stage produces an approximate solution to a dual QP problem and the second stage maps this approximate dual solution to an approximate primal solution. For the second stage we describe an O(n log n) algorithm that maps an √ √ approximate dual solution with accuracy (2 2Kn + 8 λ)−2 λε2 to an approximate primal solution p with accuracy ε p where n is the number of data samples, Kn is the maximum kernel value over the data and λ > 0 is the SVM regularization parameter. For the ﬁrst stage we present new results for decomposition algorithms and describe new decomposition algorithms with guaranteed accuracy and run time. In particular, for τ–rate certifying decomposition algorithms we establish the optimality of τ = 1/(n − 1). In addition we extend the recent τ = 1/(n − 1) algorithm of Simon (2004) to form two new composite algorithms that also achieve the τ = 1/(n − 1) iteration bound of List and Simon (2005), but yield faster run times in practice. We also exploit the τ–rate certifying property of these algorithms to produce new stopping rules that are computationally efﬁcient and that guarantee a speciﬁed accuracy for the approximate dual solution. Furthermore, for the dual QP problem corresponding to the standard classiﬁcation problem we describe operational conditions for which the Simon and composite algorithms possess an upper bound of O(n) on the number of iterations. For this same problem we also describe general conditions for which a matching lower bound exists for any decomposition algorithm that uses working sets of size 2. For the Simon and composite algorithms we also establish an O(n2 ) bound on the overall run time for the ﬁrst stage. Combining the ﬁrst and second stages gives an overall run time of O(n2 (c</p><p>4 0.52304578 <a title="76-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2006-Toward_Attribute_Efficient_Learning_of_Decision_Lists_and_Parities.html">92 jmlr-2006-Toward Attribute Efficient Learning of Decision Lists and Parities</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam R. Klivans, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We consider two well-studied problems regarding attribute efﬁcient learning: learning decision lists and learning parity functions. First, we give an algorithm for learning decision lists of length ˜ 1/3 ˜ 1/3 k over n variables using 2O(k ) log n examples and time nO(k ) . This is the ﬁrst algorithm for learning decision lists that has both subexponential sample complexity and subexponential running time in the relevant parameters. Our approach establishes a relationship between attribute efﬁcient learning and polynomial threshold functions and is based on a new construction of low degree, low weight polynomial threshold functions for decision lists. For a wide range of parameters our construction matches a lower bound due to Beigel for decision lists and gives an essentially optimal tradeoff between polynomial threshold function degree and weight. Second, we give an algorithm for learning an unknown parity function on k out of n variables using O(n1−1/k ) examples in poly(n) time. For k = o(log n) this yields a polynomial time algorithm with sample complexity o(n); this is the ﬁrst polynomial time algorithm for learning parity on a superconstant number of variables with sublinear sample complexity. We also give a simple algorithm for learning an unknown length-k parity using O(k log n) examples in nk/2 time, which improves on the naive nk time bound of exhaustive search.

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Ofer Dekel, Joseph Keshet, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We present a family of margin based online learning algorithms for various prediction tasks. In particular we derive and analyze algorithms for binary and multiclass categorization, regression, uniclass prediction and sequence prediction. The update steps of our different algorithms are all based on analytical solutions to simple constrained optimization problems. This uniﬁed view allows us to prove worst-case loss bounds for the different algorithms and for the various decision problems based on a single lemma. Our bounds on the cumulative loss of the algorithms are relative to the smallest loss that can be attained by any ﬁxed hypothesis, and as such are applicable to both realizable and unrealizable settings. We demonstrate some of the merits of the proposed algorithms in a series of experiments with synthetic and real data sets.</p><p>6 0.46513182 <a title="76-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2006-Step_Size_Adaptation_in_Reproducing_Kernel_Hilbert_Space.html">86 jmlr-2006-Step Size Adaptation in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space</a></p>

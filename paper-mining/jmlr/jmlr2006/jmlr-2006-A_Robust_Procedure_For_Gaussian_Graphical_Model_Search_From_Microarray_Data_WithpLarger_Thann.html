<h1>5 jmlr-2006-A Robust Procedure For Gaussian Graphical Model Search From Microarray Data WithpLarger Thann</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2006-5-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume7/castelo06a/castelo06a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Robert Castelo, Alberto Roverato</p><p>Abstract: Learning of large-scale networks of interactions from microarray data is an important and challenging problem in bioinformatics. A widely used approach is to assume that the available data constitute a random sample from a multivariate distribution belonging to a Gaussian graphical model. As a consequence, the prime objects of inference are full-order partial correlations which are partial correlations between two variables given the remaining ones. In the context of microarray data the number of variables exceed the sample size and this precludes the application of traditional structure learning procedures because a sampling version of full-order partial correlations does not exist. In this paper we consider limited-order partial correlations, these are partial correlations computed on marginal distributions of manageable size, and provide a set of rules that allow one to assess the usefulness of these quantities to derive the independence structure of the underlying Gaussian graphical model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel structure learning procedure based on a quantity, obtained from limited-order partial correlations, that we call the non-rejection rate. The applicability and usefulness of the procedure are demonstrated by both simulated and real data.

</p><p>3 Here E denotes ⊥X the set of missing edges of G = (V, E) as formally deﬁned in Appendix A. [sent-51, score-0.484]
</p><p>4 V \{i, j} = 0  ⇔  ¯ (i, j) ∈ E,  (1)  and for this reason G is called the concentration graph of XV . [sent-64, score-0.473]
</p><p>5 A Gaussian graphical model (Dempster, 1972) is the family of p-variate normal distributions that are Markov with respect to a given undirected graph G = (V, E). [sent-68, score-0.433]
</p><p>6 For a Gaussian graphical model with graph G the sufﬁcient statistics are given by the sample mean vector and by the sample covariance matrices SCC for C ∈ C where C is the set of cliques of G (Lauritzen, 1996, p. [sent-73, score-0.458]
</p><p>7 Structure learning aims at identifying the structure G = (V, E) with the fewest number of edges on the basis of the available data such that the underlying distribution PV is undirected Markov over G. [sent-77, score-0.426]
</p><p>8 Hence, the prime object of interest is the inverse of the covariance matrix, also known as concentration matrix, whose zero pattern deﬁnes the structure of the graphical model, known then as concentration graph. [sent-100, score-0.717]
</p><p>9 Instead of trying to learn the concentration graph of a Gaussian graphical model from microarray data, a tool employed by the bioinformatics community to describe interactions between genes is the relevance network; see Butte et al. [sent-111, score-0.87]
</p><p>10 In relevance networks missing edges denote zero correlations between pairs of genes, that in the Gaussian case imply marginal independence. [sent-114, score-0.733]
</p><p>11 A correlation coefﬁcient is zero if and only if the corresponding covariance is zero and therefore the structure of a covariance graph is derived from the zero pattern of the covariance matrix Σ. [sent-116, score-0.608]
</p><p>12 In these models an edge between two genes represents a direct association and, more generally, a path connecting two genes represents an undirect association mediated by other genes in the path (see Jones and West, 2005). [sent-122, score-0.431]
</p><p>13 A popular approach is based on limited-order partial correlations, that is q-order partial correlations with q < (n − 2). [sent-131, score-0.386]
</p><p>14 Consequently, it seems somehow sensible to replace full-order partial correlations with lower-order partial correlations so as to obtain a graph that can be regarded as an approximation of the entire concentration graph G. [sent-136, score-1.3]
</p><p>15 The procedures proposed in the literature for learning such an approximating graph are based on the application of the following rule to every distinct pair of vertices i, j ∈ V : Test the hypotheses ρi j. [sent-137, score-0.381]
</p><p>16 Then, i and j are joined by an edge if and only if all of such hypotheses of zero q-order partial correlations are rejected. [sent-139, score-0.407]
</p><p>17 Firstly, as shown in the next section, the usefulness of q-order partial correlations increases with q, so that a procedure that can be applied for larger values of q is called for. [sent-143, score-0.406]
</p><p>18 In particular, the probability that at least one hypothesis of zero q-order partial correlation is wrongly non-rejected increases with the number of performed tests and, consequently, if the value of p−2 is large then one should expect that most, q or even all, of the edges are removed. [sent-146, score-0.618]
</p><p>19 In the next section we provide a formal deﬁnition of the graph associated with q-order partial correlations that we call the q-order partial correlation graph of XV , q-partial graph hereafter, denoted by G(q) = (V, E (q) ), and derive some of its properties. [sent-147, score-1.163]
</p><p>20 In practice, however, the usefulness of G(q) depends on its closeness to G, that is, on the number of edges that are present in G(q) but are missing in G, and we will formally address this point. [sent-151, score-0.566]
</p><p>21 Even though the q-partial graph G(q) of XV may provide a good approximation to the concentration graph G, our standpoint is that the real object of interest is the concentration graph and that the q-partial graph is useful as an intermediate step of the analysis. [sent-152, score-1.424]
</p><p>22 Since the selected graph is the starting point for further investigation, our procedure is designed to be conservative, that is, it aims at keeping the number of wrongly removed edges small and, consequently, the probability of breaking the Markov condition of PV low. [sent-156, score-0.711]
</p><p>23 It follows that the selected graph may still contain edges that should be removed. [sent-157, score-0.567]
</p><p>24 However, if the underlying concentration graph is sparse the procedure will remove a large number of edges leading to a great simpliﬁcation of the learning problem. [sent-158, score-0.865]
</p><p>25 It provides an indication whether the underlying concentration graph is sparse and, in this case, it will lead to a great simpliﬁcation of the structure learning problem. [sent-162, score-0.576]
</p><p>26 q-Partial Graphs The use of limited-order partial correlations in structure learning is appealing when either p > n or the available data are too scarce to produce reliable estimates of the concentration matrix. [sent-164, score-0.558]
</p><p>27 However, the object of interest is the concentration graph G of XV and it is not clear which graph can be learnt by using q-order partial correlations, and what is the connection between such a graph and G. [sent-165, score-1.043]
</p><p>28 In this section we formally approach this question: ﬁrstly, we introduce the q-partial graph of XV , that is a graph in which missing edges correspond to zero q-order partial correlations. [sent-166, score-1.054]
</p><p>29 Secondly, we characterize the class of graphs for which concentration graphs and q-partial graphs coincide and, in particular, we show how information on the concentration graph of XV can be extracted from the qpartial graph of XV . [sent-167, score-1.243]
</p><p>30 The concentration graph of XV is associated with the probability distribution of XV and we deﬁne the q-partial graph of XV as a graph associated with the set of all marginal distributions of XV of dimension (q + 2). [sent-169, score-0.998]
</p><p>31 Deﬁnition 1 For a random vector XV and an integer 0 ≤ q ≤ (p − 2) we deﬁne the q-partial graph ¯ of XV , denoted by G(q) = (V, E (q) ), as the undirected graph where (i, j) ∈ E (q) if and only if there exists a set U ⊆ V with |U| ≤ q and i, j ∈ U such that Xi ⊥ j |XU holds in PV . [sent-170, score-0.546]
</p><p>32 ⊥X We ﬁrst observe that G(p−2) and G(0) are the concentration graph and the covariance graph of XV respectively, whereas G(1) is the 0-1 conditional independence graph introduced by Wille and B¨ hlmann (2006, Deﬁnition 3). [sent-171, score-1.131]
</p><p>33 Every edge of G is present in G(q) and in the following proposition we characterize the missing edges of G that are also missing in G(q) . [sent-176, score-0.757]
</p><p>34 Proposition 1 Let G = (V, E) and G(q) = (V, E (q) ) be the concentration and the q-partial graph of ¯ ¯ XV respectively. [sent-177, score-0.473]
</p><p>35 If this relation is satisﬁed for all the missing edges of G then the q-partial graph and the concentration graph are identical. [sent-188, score-1.196]
</p><p>36 Proposition 2 Let G = (V, E) and G(q) = (V, E (q) ) be the concentration and the q-partial graph of ¯ XV respectively. [sent-189, score-0.473]
</p><p>37 The result of Proposition 2 clariﬁes that the concentration graph G and the q-partial graph G (q) of ¯ XV coincide when d(E|G) is not greater than q so that a natural question concerns the connection ¯ between the sparseness of G and the value of d(E|G). [sent-198, score-0.786]
</p><p>38 In particular it is possible to ﬁnd examples in which the condition of Proposition 2 is satisﬁed for a graph G but is not satisﬁed for a sparser graph G ⊂ G . [sent-200, score-0.478]
</p><p>39 The point here is that sparseness is useful as long as it implies small separators for non-adjacent vertices, however it is not difﬁcult to draw a very sparse graph in which two non-adjacent vertices have high value of outer connectivity. [sent-202, score-0.576]
</p><p>40 The fact that G(q) is larger than G implies that if an edge is missing in G(q) then it is also missing in G and the next theorem provides a sufﬁcient condition to check whether an edge that is present in G(q) is also present in G. [sent-212, score-0.466]
</p><p>41 Theorem 4 Let G = (V, E) and G(q) = (V, E (q) ) be the concentration and the q-partial graph of XV respectively. [sent-213, score-0.473]
</p><p>42 Corollary 5 Let G = (V, E) and G(q) = (V, E (q) ) be the concentration and the q-partial graph of XV respectively. [sent-219, score-0.473]
</p><p>43 In the case one cannot conclude that G is equal to G(q) then Theorem 4 can be applied to decide which edges of G(q) belong also to G and which edges of G(q) may be spurious. [sent-222, score-0.656]
</p><p>44 The computation of the outer connectivity of two vertices is known to be a NP-hard problem. [sent-225, score-0.383]
</p><p>45 We close this section by noticing that the outer connectivity of edges and the outer connectivity of missing edges play a different role with respect to G(q) . [sent-228, score-1.368]
</p><p>46 Indeed, both the value of d(E|G) and of d(E (q) |G(q) ) are irrelevant here, and a concentration graph can coincide with a q-partial graph even if its edges have a very high maximal degree of outer connectivity; recall that d(E|G) ≤ d(E (q) |G(q) ) by (14). [sent-230, score-1.134]
</p><p>47 On the other hand, the values of d(i, j|G(q) ) for (i, j) ∈ E (q) are important for the practical usefulness of q-partial graphs: the larger the number of edges of (i, j) ∈ E (q) with d(i, j|G(q) ) ≤ q the larger is ¯ the amount of information that G(q) provides with respect to G. [sent-231, score-0.41]
</p><p>48 The latter is a probability associated with every pair of variables Xi and X j , and turns out to be useful in discriminating between present and missing edges in G (q) . [sent-236, score-0.484]
</p><p>49 The qp-procedure ﬁrstly estimates the value of all the p × (p − 1)/2 non-rejection rates and then a graph G(q) is constructed by removing from the complete graph all the edges corresponding to the pairs of variables whose ﬁtted value of the non-rejection rate is above a given threshold. [sent-237, score-0.861]
</p><p>50 The qpprocedure aims at identifying some of, but not necessarily all the, missing edges of G (q) by keeping the number of wrongly removed edges low and thus trying to avoid breaking the Markov condition of the underlying probability distribution. [sent-279, score-0.926]
</p><p>51 A missing edge is identiﬁed by the qp-procedure if its non-rejection rate is above β ∗ ; however, the procedure does not aim at removing all missing edges and it is only important that the value of the non-rejection rate is above β∗ for a large number of missing edges. [sent-284, score-1.013]
</p><p>52 A sufﬁcient condition for this to happen is that (i) G(q) has a large number of missing edges and (ii) for a large number of such missing edges, the value of πi j is high. [sent-285, score-0.64]
</p><p>53 We can conclude that a larger value of q allows us to identify a larger number of missing edges but also decreases the power of the statistical tests, making present edges more difﬁcult to identify; see Section 5. [sent-291, score-0.812]

</p><p>56 For the case q = 20, Figure 2 gives the boxplots of the estimates of the non-rejection rate for the present and missing edges of G(20) . [sent-319, score-0.539]
</p><p>57 This picture provides a clear example of the different behavior of the non-rejection rate for present and missing edges and it is also worth recalling that that there is a large difference in the number of present and missing edges: 1206 versus 12 160. [sent-320, score-0.695]
</p><p>58 To understand the usefulness of this plot one has to recall that in Gaussian graphical models the real dimension of the problem is given by the size of the largest clique of the concentration graph. [sent-327, score-0.615]

</p><p>90 Indeed, the qp-procedure can be used as an explorative tool to assess the sparseness of the concentration graph and, therefore, the usefulness of q-partial correlations in structure learning. [sent-972, score-0.861]
</p><p>91 Graph Theory In this appendix we present the graph theory required for this paper and, in particular, we introduce the novel concept of outer connectivity that is used in Section 4 to describe the properties of qpartial graphs. [sent-998, score-0.517]
</p><p>92 If two vertices i, j ∈ V form an edge then we say that i and j are adjacent and write (i, j) ∈ E; recall that edges are unordered pairs, so that (i, j) = ( j, i). [sent-1005, score-0.539]
</p><p>93 The set E is the set of missing edges of ¯ G; that is, for a pair i, j ∈ V , (i, j) ∈ E if and only if i = j and (i, j) ∈ E. [sent-1013, score-0.484]
</p><p>94 2645  C ASTELO AND ROVERATO  Deﬁnition 3 Let i = j be a pair vertices of an undirected graph G = (V, E). [sent-1039, score-0.412]
</p><p>95 The outer connectivity of i and j is deﬁned as d(i, j|G) =  min |S|  S∈S(i, j|Gi j )  where Gi j is the graph with vertex set V and edge set Ei j = E\{(i, j)}. [sent-1040, score-0.645]
</p><p>96 Hence, we deﬁne the outer connectivity of the edges of G = (V, E) as d(E|G) := max d(i, j|G), (i, j)∈E  2646  G AUSSIAN G RAPHICAL M ODEL S EARCH F ROM M ICROARRAY DATA W ITH p L ARGER T HAN n  / with the understanding that d(E|G) = 0 if E = 0; that is if G as no edges.

</p><p>98 Thus the complete graph is dense and the graph in which the edge set is empty is sparse; furthermore, if G ⊂ G than we can say that G is sparser than G . [sent-1061, score-0.555]
</p><p>99 Since G is obtained by removing edges from the larger graph G the intuition suggests that G has a smaller number of independent paths between vertices and consequently smaller values of outer connectivity. [sent-1062, score-0.766]

<p>Author: Robert Castelo, Alberto Roverato</p><p>Abstract: Learning of large-scale networks of interactions from microarray data is an important and challenging problem in bioinformatics. A widely used approach is to assume that the available data constitute a random sample from a multivariate distribution belonging to a Gaussian graphical model. As a consequence, the prime objects of inference are full-order partial correlations which are partial correlations between two variables given the remaining ones. In the context of microarray data the number of variables exceed the sample size and this precludes the application of traditional structure learning procedures because a sampling version of full-order partial correlations does not exist. In this paper we consider limited-order partial correlations, these are partial correlations computed on marginal distributions of manageable size, and provide a set of rules that allow one to assess the usefulness of these quantities to derive the independence structure of the underlying Gaussian graphical model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel structure learning procedure based on a quantity, obtained from limited-order partial correlations, that we call the non-rejection rate. The applicability and usefulness of the procedure are demonstrated by both simulated and real data.

<p>Author: Alberto Roverato, Milan Studený</p><p>Abstract: This paper deals with chain graph models under alternative AMP interpretation. A new representative of an AMP Markov equivalence class, called the largest deﬂagged graph, is proposed.

The largest deﬂagged graph is the largest chain graph in that distinguished strong equivalence class.

<p>Author: Dmitry M. Malioutov, Jason K. Johnson, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We present a new framework based on walks in a graph for analysis and inference in Gaussian graphical models. The key idea is to decompose the correlation between each pair of variables as a sum over all walks between those variables in the graph. The weight of each walk is given by a product of edgewise partial correlation coefﬁcients. This representation holds for a large class of Gaussian graphical models which we call walk-summable. We give a precise characterization of this class of models, and relate it to other classes including diagonally dominant, attractive, nonfrustrated, and pairwise-normalizable. We provide a walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian belief propagation in trees and of the approximate method of loopy belief propagation in graphs with cycles. The walk-sum perspective leads to a better understanding of Gaussian belief propagation and to stronger results for its convergence in loopy graphs.

<p>Author: Dana Angluin, Jiang Chen</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a hypergraph using edge-detecting queries. In this model, the learner may query whether a set of vertices induces an edge of the hidden hypergraph or not. We show that an r-uniform hypergraph with m edges and n vertices is learnable with O(2 4r m · poly(r, log n)) queries with high probability. The queries can be made in O(min(2 r (log m + r)2 , (log m + r)3 )) rounds. We also give an algorithm that learns an almost uniform hypergraph of ∆ ∆ dimension r using O(2O((1+ 2 )r) · m1+ 2 · poly(log n)) queries with high probability, where ∆ is the difference between the maximum and the minimum edge sizes. This upper bound matches our ∆ lower bound of Ω(( m∆ )1+ 2 ) for this class of hypergraphs in terms of dependence on m. The 1+ 2 queries can also be made in O((1 + ∆) · min(2r (log m + r)2 , (log m + r)3 )) rounds.

<p>Author: Robert Castelo, Alberto Roverato</p><p>Abstract: Learning of large-scale networks of interactions from microarray data is an important and challenging problem in bioinformatics. A widely used approach is to assume that the available data constitute a random sample from a multivariate distribution belonging to a Gaussian graphical model. As a consequence, the prime objects of inference are full-order partial correlations which are partial correlations between two variables given the remaining ones. In the context of microarray data the number of variables exceed the sample size and this precludes the application of traditional structure learning procedures because a sampling version of full-order partial correlations does not exist. In this paper we consider limited-order partial correlations, these are partial correlations computed on marginal distributions of manageable size, and provide a set of rules that allow one to assess the usefulness of these quantities to derive the independence structure of the underlying Gaussian graphical model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel structure learning procedure based on a quantity, obtained from limited-order partial correlations, that we call the non-rejection rate. The applicability and usefulness of the procedure are demonstrated by both simulated and real data.

<p>Author: Andrew B. Gardner, Abba M. Krieger, George Vachtsevanos, Brian Litt</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes an application of one-class support vector machine (SVM) novelty detection for detecting seizures in humans. Our technique maps intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) time series into corresponding novelty sequences by classifying short-time, energy-based statistics computed from one-second windows of data. We train a classifier on epochs of interictal (normal) EEG. During ictal (seizure) epochs of EEG, seizure activity induces distributional changes in feature space that increase the empirical outlier fraction. A hypothesis test determines when the parameter change differs significantly from its nominal value, signaling a seizure detection event. Outputs are gated in a “one-shot” manner using persistence to reduce the false alarm rate of the system. The detector was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) on a sample of 41 interictal and 29 ictal epochs, and achieved 97.1% sensitivity, a mean detection latency of ©2005 Andrew B. Gardner, Abba M. Krieger, George Vachtsevanos and Brian Litt GARDNER, KRIEGER, VACHTSEVANOS AND LITT -7.58 seconds, and an asymptotic false positive rate (FPR) of 1.56 false positives per hour (Fp/hr). These results are better than those obtained from a novelty detection technique based on Mahalanobis distance outlier detection, and comparable to the performance of a supervised learning technique used in experimental implantable devices (Echauz et al., 2001). The novelty detection paradigm overcomes three significant limitations of competing methods: the need to collect seizure data, precisely mark seizure onset and offset times, and perform patient-specific parameter tuning for detector training.

<p>Author: Don Hush, Patrick Kelly, Clint Scovel, Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: We describe polynomial–time algorithms that produce approximate solutions with guaranteed accuracy for a class of QP problems that are used in the design of support vector machine classiﬁers. These algorithms employ a two–stage process where the ﬁrst stage produces an approximate solution to a dual QP problem and the second stage maps this approximate dual solution to an approximate primal solution. For the second stage we describe an O(n log n) algorithm that maps an √ √ approximate dual solution with accuracy (2 2Kn + 8 λ)−2 λε2 to an approximate primal solution p with accuracy ε p where n is the number of data samples, Kn is the maximum kernel value over the data and λ > 0 is the SVM regularization parameter. For the ﬁrst stage we present new results for decomposition algorithms and describe new decomposition algorithms with guaranteed accuracy and run time. In particular, for τ–rate certifying decomposition algorithms we establish the optimality of τ = 1/(n − 1). In addition we extend the recent τ = 1/(n − 1) algorithm of Simon (2004) to form two new composite algorithms that also achieve the τ = 1/(n − 1) iteration bound of List and Simon (2005), but yield faster run times in practice. We also exploit the τ–rate certifying property of these algorithms to produce new stopping rules that are computationally efﬁcient and that guarantee a speciﬁed accuracy for the approximate dual solution. Furthermore, for the dual QP problem corresponding to the standard classiﬁcation problem we describe operational conditions for which the Simon and composite algorithms possess an upper bound of O(n) on the number of iterations. For this same problem we also describe general conditions for which a matching lower bound exists for any decomposition algorithm that uses working sets of size 2. For the Simon and composite algorithms we also establish an O(n2 ) bound on the overall run time for the ﬁrst stage. Combining the ﬁrst and second stages gives an overall run time of O(n2 (c</p><p>4 0.52686507 <a title="5-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2006-Accurate_Error_Bounds_for_the_Eigenvalues_of_the_Kernel_Matrix.html">9 jmlr-2006-Accurate Error Bounds for the Eigenvalues of the Kernel Matrix</a></p>
<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun</p><p>Abstract: The eigenvalues of the kernel matrix play an important role in a number of kernel methods, in particular, in kernel principal component analysis. It is well known that the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix converge as the number of samples tends to inﬁnity. We derive probabilistic ﬁnite sample size bounds on the approximation error of individual eigenvalues which have the important property that the bounds scale with the eigenvalue under consideration, reﬂecting the actual behavior of the approximation errors as predicted by asymptotic results and observed in numerical simulations. Such scaling bounds have so far only been known for tail sums of eigenvalues. Asymptotically, the bounds presented here have a slower than stochastic rate, but the number of sample points necessary to make this disadvantage noticeable is often unrealistically large. Therefore, under practical conditions, and for all but the largest few eigenvalues, the bounds presented here form a signiﬁcant improvement over existing non-scaling bounds.

<p>Author: Thomas Kämpke</p><p>Abstract: Similarity of edge labeled graphs is considered in the sense of minimum squared distance between corresponding values. Vertex correspondences are established by isomorphisms if both graphs are of equal size and by subisomorphisms if one graph has fewer vertices than the other. Best ﬁt isomorphisms and subisomorphisms amount to solutions of quadratic assignment problems and are computed exactly as well as approximately by minimum cost ﬂow, linear assignment relaxations and related graph algorithms.

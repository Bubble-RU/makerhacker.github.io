<p>Author: Peng Zhao, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity or parsimony of statistical models is crucial for their proper interpretations, as in sciences and social sciences. Model selection is a commonly used method to ﬁnd such models, but usually involves a computationally heavy combinatorial search. Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) is now being used as a computationally feasible alternative to model selection. Therefore it is important to study Lasso for model selection purposes. In this paper, we prove that a single condition, which we call the Irrepresentable Condition, is almost necessary and sufﬁcient for Lasso to select the true model both in the classical ﬁxed p setting and in the large p setting as the sample size n gets large. Based on these results, sufﬁcient conditions that are veriﬁable in practice are given to relate to previous works and help applications of Lasso for feature selection and sparse representation. This Irrepresentable Condition, which depends mainly on the covariance of the predictor variables, states that Lasso selects the true model consistently if and (almost) only if the predictors that are not in the true model are “irrepresentable” (in a sense to be clariﬁed) by predictors that are in the true model. Furthermore, simulations are carried out to provide insights and understanding of this result.

<p>Author: Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We discuss the problem of learning to rank labels from a real valued feedback associated with each label. We cast the feedback as a preferences graph where the nodes of the graph are the labels and edges express preferences over labels. We tackle the learning problem by deﬁning a loss function for comparing a predicted graph with a feedback graph. This loss is materialized by decomposing the feedback graph into bipartite sub-graphs. We then adopt the maximum-margin framework which leads to a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints. While the size of the problem grows quadratically with the number of the nodes in the feedback graph, we derive a problem of a signiﬁcantly smaller size and prove that it attains the same minimum. We then describe an efﬁcient algorithm, called SOPOPO, for solving the reduced problem by employing a soft projection onto the polyhedron deﬁned by a reduced set of constraints. We also describe and analyze a wrapper procedure for batch learning when multiple graphs are provided for training. We conclude with a set of experiments which show signiﬁcant improvements in run time over a state of the art interior-point algorithm.</p><p>5 0.050481025 <a title="83-tfidf-5" href="./jmlr-2006-Ensemble_Pruning_Via_Semi-definite_Programming_%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%28Special_Topic_on_Machine_Learning_and_Optimization%29.html">27 jmlr-2006-Ensemble Pruning Via Semi-definite Programming     (Special Topic on Machine Learning and Optimization)</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Samuel Burer, W. Nick Street</p><p>Abstract: An ensemble is a group of learning models that jointly solve a problem. However, the ensembles generated by existing techniques are sometimes unnecessarily large, which can lead to extra memory usage, computational costs, and occasional decreases in eﬀectiveness. The purpose of ensemble pruning is to search for a good subset of ensemble members that performs as well as, or better than, the original ensemble. This subset selection problem is a combinatorial optimization problem and thus ﬁnding the exact optimal solution is computationally prohibitive. Various heuristic methods have been developed to obtain an approximate solution. However, most of the existing heuristics use simple greedy search as the optimization method, which lacks either theoretical or empirical quality guarantees. In this paper, the ensemble subset selection problem is formulated as a quadratic integer programming problem. By applying semi-deﬁnite programming (SDP) as a solution technique, we are able to get better approximate solutions. Computational experiments show that this SDP-based pruning algorithm outperforms other heuristics in the literature. Its application in a classiﬁer-sharing study also demonstrates the eﬀectiveness of the method.

To overcome this problem we devise a primal method with the following properties: (1) it decouples the idea of basis functions from the concept of support vectors; (2) it greedily ﬁnds a set of kernel basis functions of a speciﬁed maximum size (dmax ) to approximate the SVM primal cost function well; (3) it is 2 efﬁcient and roughly scales as O(ndmax ) where n is the number of training examples; and, (4) the number of basis functions it requires to achieve an accuracy close to the SVM accuracy is usually far less than the number of SVM support vectors.

<p>Author: Peter Bühlmann, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: We propose Sparse Boosting (the SparseL2 Boost algorithm), a variant on boosting with the squared error loss. SparseL2 Boost yields sparser solutions than the previously proposed L2 Boosting by minimizing some penalized L2 -loss functions, the FPE model selection criteria, through smallstep gradient descent. Although boosting may give already relatively sparse solutions, for example corresponding to the soft-thresholding estimator in orthogonal linear models, there is sometimes a desire for more sparseness to increase prediction accuracy and ability for better variable selection: such goals can be achieved with SparseL2 Boost. We prove an equivalence of SparseL2 Boost to Breiman’s nonnegative garrote estimator for orthogonal linear models and demonstrate the generic nature of SparseL2 Boost for nonparametric interaction modeling. For an automatic selection of the tuning parameter in SparseL2 Boost we propose to employ the gMDL model selection criterion which can also be used for early stopping of L2 Boosting. Consequently, we can select between SparseL2 Boost and L2 Boosting by comparing their gMDL scores.

<p>Author: Clayton D. Scott, Robert D. Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Given a probability measure P and a reference measure µ, one is often interested in the minimum µ-measure set with P-measure at least α. Minimum volume sets of this type summarize the regions of greatest probability mass of P, and are useful for detecting anomalies and constructing conﬁdence regions. This paper addresses the problem of estimating minimum volume sets based on independent samples distributed according to P. Other than these samples, no other information is available regarding P, but the reference measure µ is assumed to be known. We introduce rules for estimating minimum volume sets that parallel the empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization principles in classiﬁcation. As in classiﬁcation, we show that the performances of our estimators are controlled by the rate of uniform convergence of empirical to true probabilities over the class from which the estimator is drawn. Thus we obtain ﬁnite sample size performance bounds in terms of VC dimension and related quantities. We also demonstrate strong universal consistency, an oracle inequality, and rates of convergence. The proposed estimators are illustrated with histogram and decision tree set estimation rules.

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, David Heckerman, Eric Horvitz</p><p>Abstract: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are a standard way to display the performance of a set of binary classiﬁers for all feasible ratios of the costs associated with false positives and false negatives. For linear classiﬁers, the set of classiﬁers is typically obtained by training once, holding constant the estimated slope and then varying the intercept to obtain a parameterized set of classiﬁers whose performances can be plotted in the ROC plane. We consider the alternative of varying the asymmetry of the cost function used for training. We show that the ROC curve obtained by varying both the intercept and the asymmetry, and hence the slope, always outperforms the ROC curve obtained by varying only the intercept. In addition, we present a path-following algorithm for the support vector machine (SVM) that can compute efﬁciently the entire ROC curve, and that has the same computational complexity as training a single classiﬁer. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the asymmetric cost model assumed when training a classiﬁer and the cost model assumed in applying the classiﬁer. In particular, we show that the mismatch between the step function used for testing and its convex upper bounds, usually used for training, leads to a provable and quantiﬁable difference around extreme asymmetries.

<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: Consider the problem of joint parameter estimation and prediction in a Markov random ﬁeld: that is, the model parameters are estimated on the basis of an initial set of data, and then the ﬁtted model is used to perform prediction (e.g., smoothing, denoising, interpolation) on a new noisy observation. Working under the restriction of limited computation, we analyze a joint method in which the same convex variational relaxation is used to construct an M-estimator for ﬁtting parameters, and to perform approximate marginalization for the prediction step. The key result of this paper is that in the computation-limited setting, using an inconsistent parameter estimator (i.e., an estimator that returns the “wrong” model even in the inﬁnite data limit) is provably beneﬁcial, since the resulting errors can partially compensate for errors made by using an approximate prediction technique. En route to this result, we analyze the asymptotic properties of M-estimators based on convex variational relaxations, and establish a Lipschitz stability property that holds for a broad class of convex variational methods. This stability result provides additional incentive, apart from the obvious beneﬁt of unique global optima, for using message-passing methods based on convex variational relaxations. We show that joint estimation/prediction based on the reweighted sum-product algorithm substantially outperforms a commonly used heuristic based on ordinary sum-product.

<p>Author: Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We discuss the problem of learning to rank labels from a real valued feedback associated with each label. We cast the feedback as a preferences graph where the nodes of the graph are the labels and edges express preferences over labels. We tackle the learning problem by deﬁning a loss function for comparing a predicted graph with a feedback graph. This loss is materialized by decomposing the feedback graph into bipartite sub-graphs. We then adopt the maximum-margin framework which leads to a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints. While the size of the problem grows quadratically with the number of the nodes in the feedback graph, we derive a problem of a signiﬁcantly smaller size and prove that it attains the same minimum. We then describe an efﬁcient algorithm, called SOPOPO, for solving the reduced problem by employing a soft projection onto the polyhedron deﬁned by a reduced set of constraints. We also describe and analyze a wrapper procedure for batch learning when multiple graphs are provided for training. We conclude with a set of experiments which show signiﬁcant improvements in run time over a state of the art interior-point algorithm.</p><p>6 0.34289485 <a title="83-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2006-Learning_a_Hidden_Hypergraph.html">53 jmlr-2006-Learning a Hidden Hypergraph</a></p>

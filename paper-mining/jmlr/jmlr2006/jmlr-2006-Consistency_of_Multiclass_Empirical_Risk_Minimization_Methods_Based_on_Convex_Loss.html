<p>Author: Tzu-Kuo Huang, Ruby C. Weng, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: The Bradley-Terry model for obtaining individual skill from paired comparisons has been popular in many areas. In machine learning, this model is related to multi-class probability estimates by coupling all pairwise classiﬁcation results. Error correcting output codes (ECOC) are a general framework to decompose a multi-class problem to several binary problems. To obtain probability estimates under this framework, this paper introduces a generalized Bradley-Terry model in which paired individual comparisons are extended to paired team comparisons. We propose a simple algorithm with convergence proofs to solve the model and obtain individual skill. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the algorithm is useful for obtaining multi-class probability estimates. Moreover, we discuss four extensions of the proposed model: 1) weighted individual skill, 2) home-ﬁeld advantage, 3) ties, and 4) comparisons with more than two teams.

<p>Author: Ross A. Lippert, Ryan M. Rifkin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of Tikhonov regularization with a general convex loss function: this formalism includes support vector machines and regularized least squares. For a family of kernels that includes the Gaussian, parameterized by a “bandwidth” parameter σ, we characterize the limiting ˜ solution as σ → ∞. In particular, we show that if we set the regularization parameter λ = λσ−2p , the regularization term of the Tikhonov problem tends to an indicator function on polynomials of degree ⌊p⌋ (with residual regularization in the case where p ∈ Z). The proof rests on two key ideas: epi-convergence, a notion of functional convergence under which limits of minimizers converge to minimizers of limits, and a value-based formulation of learning, where we work with regularization on the function output values (y) as opposed to the function expansion coefﬁcients in the RKHS. Our result generalizes and uniﬁes previous results in this area.

<p>Author: Andrea Caponnetto, Alexander Rakhlin</p><p>Abstract: We study some stability properties of algorithms which minimize (or almost-minimize) empirical error over Donsker classes of functions. We show that, as the number n of samples grows, the L 2 1 diameter of the set of almost-minimizers of empirical error with tolerance ξ(n) = o(n − 2 ) converges to zero in probability. Hence, even in the case of multiple minimizers of expected error, as n increases it becomes less and less likely that adding a sample (or a number of samples) to the training set will result in a large jump to a new hypothesis. Moreover, under some assumptions on the entropy of the class, along with an assumption of Komlos-Major-Tusnady type, we derive a power rate of decay for the diameter of almost-minimizers. This rate, through an application of a uniform ratio limit inequality, is shown to govern the closeness of the expected errors of the almost-minimizers. In fact, under the above assumptions, the expected errors of almost-minimizers become closer with a rate strictly faster than n−1/2 .

<p>Author: Guillaume Lecué</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we prove the optimality of an aggregation procedure. We prove lower bounds for aggregation of model selection type of M density estimators for the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL), the Hellinger’s distance and the L1 -distance. The lower bound, with respect to the KL distance, can be achieved by the on-line type estimate suggested, among others, by Yang (2000a). Combining these results, we state that log M/n is an optimal rate of aggregation in the sense of Tsybakov (2003), where n is the sample size.

<p>Author: Pieter Abbeel, Daphne Koller, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We study the computational and sample complexity of parameter and structure learning in graphical models. Our main result shows that the class of factor graphs with bounded degree can be learned in polynomial time and from a polynomial number of training examples, assuming that the data is generated by a network in this class. This result covers both parameter estimation for a known network structure and structure learning. It implies as a corollary that we can learn factor graphs for both Bayesian networks and Markov networks of bounded degree, in polynomial time and sample complexity. Importantly, unlike standard maximum likelihood estimation algorithms, our method does not require inference in the underlying network, and so applies to networks where inference is intractable. We also show that the error of our learned model degrades gracefully when the generating distribution is not a member of the target class of networks. In addition to our main result, we show that the sample complexity of parameter learning in graphical models has an O(1) dependence on the number of variables in the model when using the KL-divergence normalized by the number of variables as the performance criterion.1 Keywords: probabilistic graphical models, parameter and structure learning, factor graphs, Markov networks, Bayesian networks</p><p>6 0.19289428 <a title="24-lsi-6" href="./jmlr-2006-Lower_Bounds_and_Aggregation_in_Density_Estimation.html">58 jmlr-2006-Lower Bounds and Aggregation in Density Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Schmitt, Laura Martignon</p><p>Abstract: Fast and frugal heuristics are well studied models of bounded rationality. Psychological research has proposed the take-the-best heuristic as a successful strategy in decision making with limited resources. Take-the-best searches for a sufﬁciently good ordering of cues (or features) in a task where objects are to be compared lexicographically. We investigate the computational complexity of ﬁnding optimal cue permutations for lexicographic strategies and prove that the problem is NP-complete. It follows that no efﬁcient (that is, polynomial-time) algorithm computes optimal solutions, unless P = NP. We further analyze the complexity of approximating optimal cue permutations for lexicographic strategies. We show that there is no efﬁcient algorithm that approximates the optimum to within any constant factor, unless P = NP. The results have implications for the complexity of learning lexicographic strategies from examples. They show that learning them in polynomial time within the model of agnostic probably approximately correct (PAC) learning is impossible, unless RP = NP. We further consider greedy approaches for building lexicographic strategies and determine upper and lower bounds for the performance ratio of simple algorithms. Moreover, we present a greedy algorithm that performs provably better than take-the-best. Tight bounds on the sample complexity for learning lexicographic strategies are also given in this article.

<p>Author: Di-Rong Chen, Tao Sun</p><p>Abstract: The consistency of classiﬁcation algorithm plays a central role in statistical learning theory. A consistent algorithm guarantees us that taking more samples essentially sufﬁces to roughly reconstruct the unknown distribution. We consider the consistency of ERM scheme over classes of combinations of very simple rules (base classiﬁers) in multiclass classiﬁcation. Our approach is, under some mild conditions, to establish a quantitative relationship between classiﬁcation errors and convex risks. In comparison with the related previous work, the feature of our result is that the conditions are mainly expressed in terms of the differences between some values of the convex function.

<p>Author: Andrea Caponnetto, Alexander Rakhlin</p><p>Abstract: We study some stability properties of algorithms which minimize (or almost-minimize) empirical error over Donsker classes of functions. We show that, as the number n of samples grows, the L 2 1 diameter of the set of almost-minimizers of empirical error with tolerance ξ(n) = o(n − 2 ) converges to zero in probability. Hence, even in the case of multiple minimizers of expected error, as n increases it becomes less and less likely that adding a sample (or a number of samples) to the training set will result in a large jump to a new hypothesis. Moreover, under some assumptions on the entropy of the class, along with an assumption of Komlos-Major-Tusnady type, we derive a power rate of decay for the diameter of almost-minimizers. This rate, through an application of a uniform ratio limit inequality, is shown to govern the closeness of the expected errors of the almost-minimizers. In fact, under the above assumptions, the expected errors of almost-minimizers become closer with a rate strictly faster than n−1/2 .

<p>Author: Peter J. Bickel, Ya'acov Ritov, Alon Zakai</p><p>Abstract: We give a review of various aspects of boosting, clarifying the issues through a few simple results, and relate our work and that of others to the minimax paradigm of statistics. We consider the population version of the boosting algorithm and prove its convergence to the Bayes classiﬁer as a corollary of a general result about Gauss-Southwell optimization in Hilbert space. We then investigate the algorithmic convergence of the sample version, and give bounds to the time until perfect separation of the sample. We conclude by some results on the statistical optimality of the L2 boosting.

<p>Author: Kazuho Watanabe, Sumio Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian learning has been widely used and proved to be effective in many data modeling problems. However, computations involved in it require huge costs and generally cannot be performed exactly. The variational Bayesian approach, proposed as an approximation of Bayesian learning, has provided computational tractability and good generalization performance in many applications. The properties and capabilities of variational Bayesian learning itself have not been clariﬁed yet. It is still unknown how good approximation the variational Bayesian approach can achieve. In this paper, we discuss variational Bayesian learning of Gaussian mixture models and derive upper and lower bounds of variational stochastic complexities. The variational stochastic complexity, which corresponds to the minimum variational free energy and a lower bound of the Bayesian evidence, not only becomes important in addressing the model selection problem, but also enables us to discuss the accuracy of the variational Bayesian approach as an approximation of true Bayesian learning.

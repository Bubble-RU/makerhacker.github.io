<p>Author: Hichem Sahbi, Donald Geman</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a computational design for pattern detection based on a tree-structured network of support vector machines (SVMs). An SVM is associated with each cell in a recursive partitioning of the space of patterns (hypotheses) into increasingly ﬁner subsets. The hierarchy is traversed coarse-to-ﬁne and each chain of positive responses from the root to a leaf constitutes a detection. Our objective is to design and build a network which balances overall error and computation. Initially, SVMs are constructed for each cell with no constraints. This “free network” is then perturbed, cell by cell, into another network, which is “graded” in two ways: ﬁrst, the number of support vectors of each SVM is reduced (by clustering) in order to adjust to a pre-determined, increasing function of cell depth; second, the decision boundaries are shifted to preserve all positive responses from the original set of training data. The limits on the numbers of clusters (virtual support vectors) result from minimizing the mean computational cost of collecting all detections subject to a bound on the expected number of false positives. When applied to detecting faces in cluttered scenes, the patterns correspond to poses and the free network is already faster and more accurate than applying a single pose-speciﬁc SVM many times. The graded network promotes very rapid processing of background regions while maintaining the discriminatory power of the free network.

<p>Author: Seyoung Kim, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a general probabilistic framework for shape-based modeling and classiﬁcation of waveform data. A segmental hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to characterize waveform shape and shape variation is captured by adding random effects to the segmental model. The resulting probabilistic framework provides a basis for learning of waveform models from data as well as parsing and recognition of new waveforms. Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms are derived and investigated for ﬁtting such models to data. In particular, the “expectation conditional maximization either” (ECME) algorithm is shown to provide signiﬁcantly faster convergence than a standard EM procedure. Experimental results on two real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to improved accuracy in classiﬁcation and segmentation when compared to alternatives such as Euclidean distance matching, dynamic time warping, and segmental HMMs without random effects.

<p>Author: Andrew B. Gardner, Abba M. Krieger, George Vachtsevanos, Brian Litt</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes an application of one-class support vector machine (SVM) novelty detection for detecting seizures in humans. Our technique maps intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) time series into corresponding novelty sequences by classifying short-time, energy-based statistics computed from one-second windows of data. We train a classifier on epochs of interictal (normal) EEG. During ictal (seizure) epochs of EEG, seizure activity induces distributional changes in feature space that increase the empirical outlier fraction. A hypothesis test determines when the parameter change differs significantly from its nominal value, signaling a seizure detection event. Outputs are gated in a “one-shot” manner using persistence to reduce the false alarm rate of the system. The detector was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) on a sample of 41 interictal and 29 ictal epochs, and achieved 97.1% sensitivity, a mean detection latency of ©2005 Andrew B. Gardner, Abba M. Krieger, George Vachtsevanos and Brian Litt GARDNER, KRIEGER, VACHTSEVANOS AND LITT -7.58 seconds, and an asymptotic false positive rate (FPR) of 1.56 false positives per hour (Fp/hr). These results are better than those obtained from a novelty detection technique based on Mahalanobis distance outlier detection, and comparable to the performance of a supervised learning technique used in experimental implantable devices (Echauz et al., 2001). The novelty detection paradigm overcomes three significant limitations of competing methods: the need to collect seizure data, precisely mark seizure onset and offset times, and perform patient-specific parameter tuning for detector training.

<p>Author: Charles V. Wright, Fabian Monrose, Gerald M. Masson</p><p>Abstract: Several fundamental security mechanisms for restricting access to network resources rely on the ability of a reference monitor to inspect the contents of trafﬁc as it traverses the network. However, with the increasing popularity of cryptographic protocols, the traditional means of inspecting packet contents to enforce security policies is no longer a viable approach as message contents are concealed by encryption. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which common application protocols can be identiﬁed using only the features that remain intact after encryption—namely packet size, timing, and direction. We ﬁrst present what we believe to be the ﬁrst exploratory look at protocol identiﬁcation in encrypted tunnels which carry trafﬁc from many TCP connections simultaneously, using only post-encryption observable features. We then explore the problem of protocol identiﬁcation in individual encrypted TCP connections, using much less data than in other recent approaches. The results of our evaluation show that our classiﬁers achieve accuracy greater than 90% for several protocols in aggregate trafﬁc, and, for most protocols, greater than 80% when making ﬁne-grained classiﬁcations on single connections. Moreover, perhaps most surprisingly, we show that one can even estimate the number of live connections in certain classes of encrypted tunnels to within, on average, better than 20%.

<p>Author: Chen Yanover, Talya Meltzer, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: The problem of ﬁnding the most probable (MAP) conﬁguration in graphical models comes up in a wide range of applications. In a general graphical model this problem is NP hard, but various approximate algorithms have been developed. Linear programming (LP) relaxations are a standard method in computer science for approximating combinatorial problems and have been used for ﬁnding the most probable assignment in small graphical models. However, applying this powerful method to real-world problems is extremely challenging due to the large numbers of variables and constraints in the linear program. Tree-Reweighted Belief Propagation is a promising recent algorithm for solving LP relaxations, but little is known about its running time on large problems. In this paper we compare tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRBP) and powerful generalpurpose LP solvers (CPLEX) on relaxations of real-world graphical models from the ﬁelds of computer vision and computational biology. We ﬁnd that TRBP almost always ﬁnds the solution signiﬁcantly faster than all the solvers in CPLEX and more importantly, TRBP can be applied to large scale problems for which the solvers in CPLEX cannot be applied. Using TRBP we can ﬁnd the MAP conﬁgurations in a matter of minutes for a large range of real world problems.</p><p>3 0.27826789 <a title="97-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2006-Machine_Learning_for_Computer_Security%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%28Special_Topic_on_Machine_Learning_for_Computer_Security%29.html">59 jmlr-2006-Machine Learning for Computer Security    (Special Topic on Machine Learning for Computer Security)</a></p>

<p>Author: Jelle R. Kok, Nikos Vlassis</p><p>Abstract: In this article we describe a set of scalable techniques for learning the behavior of a group of agents in a collaborative multiagent setting. As a basis we use the framework of coordination graphs of Guestrin, Koller, and Parr (2002a) which exploits the dependencies between agents to decompose the global payoff function into a sum of local terms. First, we deal with the single-state case and describe a payoff propagation algorithm that computes the individual actions that approximately maximize the global payoff function. The method can be viewed as the decision-making analogue of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Second, we focus on learning the behavior of the agents in sequential decision-making tasks. We introduce different model-free reinforcementlearning techniques, unitedly called Sparse Cooperative Q-learning, which approximate the global action-value function based on the topology of a coordination graph, and perform updates using the contribution of the individual agents to the maximal global action value. The combined use of an edge-based decomposition of the action-value function and the payoff propagation algorithm for efﬁcient action selection, result in an approach that scales only linearly in the problem size. We provide experimental evidence that our method outperforms related multiagent reinforcement-learning methods based on temporal differences.

<p>Author: Shalabh Bhatnagar, Vivek S. Borkar, Madhukar Akarapu</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of long-run average cost control of Markov chains conditioned on a rare event. In a related recent work, a simulation based algorithm for estimating performance measures associated with a Markov chain conditioned on a rare event has been developed. We extend ideas from this work and develop an adaptive algorithm for obtaining, online, optimal control policies conditioned on a rare event. Our algorithm uses three timescales or step-size schedules. On the slowest timescale, a gradient search algorithm for policy updates that is based on one-simulation simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) type estimates is used. Deterministic perturbation sequences obtained from appropriate normalized Hadamard matrices are used here. The fast timescale recursions compute the conditional transition probabilities of an associated chain by obtaining solutions to the multiplicative Poisson equation (for a given policy estimate). Further, the risk parameter associated with the value function for a given policy estimate is updated on a timescale that lies in between the two scales above. We brieﬂy sketch the convergence analysis of our algorithm and present a numerical application in the setting of routing multiple ﬂows in communication networks.

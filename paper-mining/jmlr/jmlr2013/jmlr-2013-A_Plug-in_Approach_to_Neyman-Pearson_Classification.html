<p>Author: Aleksandr Y. Aravkin, James V. Burke, Gianluigi Pillonetto</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new class of quadratic support (QS) functions, many of which already play a crucial role in a variety of applications, including machine learning, robust statistical inference, sparsity promotion, and inverse problems such as Kalman smoothing. Well known examples of QS penalties include the ℓ2 , Huber, ℓ1 and Vapnik losses. We build on a dual representation for QS functions, using it to characterize conditions necessary to interpret these functions as negative logs of true probability densities. This interpretation establishes the foundation for statistical modeling with both known and new QS loss functions, and enables construction of non-smooth multivariate distributions with speciﬁed means and variances from simple scalar building blocks. The main contribution of this paper is a ﬂexible statistical modeling framework for a variety of learning applications, together with a toolbox of efﬁcient numerical methods for estimation. In particular, a broad subclass of QS loss functions known as piecewise linear quadratic (PLQ) penalties has a dual representation that can be exploited to design interior point (IP) methods. IP methods solve nonsmooth optimization problems by working directly with smooth systems of equations characterizing their optimality. We provide several numerical examples, along with a code that can be used to solve general PLQ problems. The efﬁciency of the IP approach depends on the structure of particular applications. We consider the class of dynamic inverse problems using Kalman smoothing.

<p>Author: Edward McFowland III, Skyler Speakman, Daniel B. Neill</p><p>Abstract: We propose Fast Generalized Subset Scan (FGSS), a new method for detecting anomalous patterns in general categorical data sets. We frame the pattern detection problem as a search over subsets of data records and attributes, maximizing a nonparametric scan statistic over all such subsets. We prove that the nonparametric scan statistics possess a novel property that allows for efﬁcient optimization over the exponentially many subsets of the data without an exhaustive search, enabling FGSS to scale to massive and high-dimensional data sets. We evaluate the performance of FGSS in three real-world application domains (customs monitoring, disease surveillance, and network intrusion detection), and demonstrate that FGSS can successfully detect and characterize relevant patterns in each domain. As compared to three other recently proposed detection algorithms, FGSS substantially decreased run time and improved detection power for massive multivariate data sets.

<p>Author: Pierre Alquier, Gérard Biau</p><p>Abstract: Let (X,Y ) be a random pair taking values in R p × R. In the so-called single-index model, one has Y = f ⋆ (θ⋆T X) +W , where f ⋆ is an unknown univariate measurable function, θ⋆ is an unknown vector in Rd , and W denotes a random noise satisfying E[W |X] = 0. The single-index model is known to offer a ﬂexible way to model a variety of high-dimensional real-world phenomena. However, despite its relative simplicity, this dimension reduction scheme is faced with severe complications as soon as the underlying dimension becomes larger than the number of observations (“p larger than n” paradigm). To circumvent this difﬁculty, we consider the single-index model estimation problem from a sparsity perspective using a PAC-Bayesian approach. On the theoretical side, we offer a sharp oracle inequality, which is more powerful than the best known oracle inequalities for other common procedures of single-index recovery. The proposed method is implemented by means of the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique and its performance is compared with that of standard procedures.

<p>Author: Tingni Sun, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new method of learning a sparse nonnegative-deﬁnite target matrix. Our primary example of the target matrix is the inverse of a population covariance or correlation matrix. The algorithm ﬁrst estimates each column of the target matrix by the scaled Lasso and then adjusts the matrix estimator to be symmetric. The penalty level of the scaled Lasso for each column is completely determined by data via convex minimization, without using cross-validation. We prove that this scaled Lasso method guarantees the fastest proven rate of convergence in the spectrum norm under conditions of weaker form than those in the existing analyses of other ℓ1 regularized algorithms, and has faster guaranteed rate of convergence when the ratio of the ℓ1 and spectrum norms of the target inverse matrix diverges to inﬁnity. A simulation study demonstrates the computational feasibility and superb performance of the proposed method. Our analysis also provides new performance bounds for the Lasso and scaled Lasso to guarantee higher concentration of the error at a smaller threshold level than previous analyses, and to allow the use of the union bound in column-by-column applications of the scaled Lasso without an adjustment of the penalty level. In addition, the least squares estimation after the scaled Lasso selection is considered and proven to guarantee performance bounds similar to that of the scaled Lasso.

<p>Author: Pierre Neuvial</p><p>Abstract: The False Discovery Rate (FDR) is a commonly used type I error rate in multiple testing problems. It is deﬁned as the expected False Discovery Proportion (FDP), that is, the expected fraction of false positives among rejected hypotheses. When the hypotheses are independent, the BenjaminiHochberg procedure achieves FDR control at any pre-speciﬁed level. By construction, FDR control offers no guarantee in terms of power, or type II error. A number of alternative procedures have been developed, including plug-in procedures that aim at gaining power by incorporating an estimate of the proportion of true null hypotheses. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of a class of plug-in procedures based on kernel estimators of the density of the p-values, as the number m of tested hypotheses grows to inﬁnity. In a setting where the hypotheses tested are independent, we prove that these procedures are asymptotically more powerful in two respects: (i) a tighter asymptotic FDR control for any target FDR level and (ii) a broader range of target levels yielding positive asymptotic power. We also show that this increased asymptotic power comes at the price of slower, non-parametric convergence rates for the FDP. These rates are of the form m−k/(2k+1) , where k is determined by the regularity of the density of the p-value distribution, or, equivalently, of the test statistics distribution. These results are applied to one- and two-sided tests statistics for Gaussian and Laplace location models, and for the Student model.

<p>Author: Xin Tong</p><p>Abstract: The Neyman-Pearson (NP) paradigm in binary classiﬁcation treats type I and type II errors with different priorities. It seeks classiﬁers that minimize type II error, subject to a type I error constraint under a user speciﬁed level α. In this paper, plug-in classiﬁers are developed under the NP paradigm. Based on the fundamental Neyman-Pearson Lemma, we propose two related plug-in classiﬁers which amount to thresholding respectively the class conditional density ratio and the regression function. These two classiﬁers handle different sampling schemes. This work focuses on theoretical properties of the proposed classiﬁers; in particular, we derive oracle inequalities that can be viewed as ﬁnite sample versions of risk bounds. NP classiﬁcation can be used to address anomaly detection problems, where asymmetry in errors is an intrinsic property. As opposed to a common practice in anomaly detection that consists of thresholding normal class density, our approach does not assume a speciﬁc form for anomaly distributions. Such consideration is particularly necessary when the anomaly class density is far from uniformly distributed.

<p>Author: Antony Joseph</p><p>Abstract: The performance of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for variable selection is analyzed for random designs. When contrasted with the deterministic case, since the performance is here measured after averaging over the distribution of the design matrix, one can have far less stringent sparsity constraints on the coefﬁcient vector. We demonstrate that for exact sparse vectors, the performance of the OMP is similar to known results on the Lasso algorithm (Wainwright, 2009). Moreover, variable selection under a more relaxed sparsity assumption on the coefﬁcient vector, whereby one has only control on the ℓ1 norm of the smaller coefﬁcients, is also analyzed. As consequence of these results, we also show that the coefﬁcient estimate satisﬁes strong oracle type inequalities.

<p>Author: Tony Cai, Wen-Xin Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We consider in this paper the problem of noisy 1-bit matrix completion under a general non-uniform sampling distribution using the max-norm as a convex relaxation for the rank. A max-norm constrained maximum likelihood estimate is introduced and studied. The rate of convergence for the estimate is obtained. Information-theoretical methods are used to establish a minimax lower bound under the general sampling model. The minimax upper and lower bounds together yield the optimal rate of convergence for the Frobenius norm loss. Computational algorithms and numerical performance are also discussed.

<p>Author: Pierre Alquier, Gérard Biau</p><p>Abstract: Let (X,Y ) be a random pair taking values in R p × R. In the so-called single-index model, one has Y = f ⋆ (θ⋆T X) +W , where f ⋆ is an unknown univariate measurable function, θ⋆ is an unknown vector in Rd , and W denotes a random noise satisfying E[W |X] = 0. The single-index model is known to offer a ﬂexible way to model a variety of high-dimensional real-world phenomena. However, despite its relative simplicity, this dimension reduction scheme is faced with severe complications as soon as the underlying dimension becomes larger than the number of observations (“p larger than n” paradigm). To circumvent this difﬁculty, we consider the single-index model estimation problem from a sparsity perspective using a PAC-Bayesian approach. On the theoretical side, we offer a sharp oracle inequality, which is more powerful than the best known oracle inequalities for other common procedures of single-index recovery. The proposed method is implemented by means of the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique and its performance is compared with that of standard procedures.

<p>Author: Markus Thom, Günther Palm</p><p>Abstract: Sparseness is a useful regularizer for learning in a wide range of applications, in particular in neural networks. This paper proposes a model targeted at classiﬁcation tasks, where sparse activity and sparse connectivity are used to enhance classiﬁcation capabilities. The tool for achieving this is a sparseness-enforcing projection operator which ﬁnds the closest vector with a pre-deﬁned sparseness for any given vector. In the theoretical part of this paper, a comprehensive theory for such a projection is developed. In conclusion, it is shown that the projection is differentiable almost everywhere and can thus be implemented as a smooth neuronal transfer function. The entire model can hence be tuned end-to-end using gradient-based methods. Experiments on the MNIST database of handwritten digits show that classiﬁcation performance can be boosted by sparse activity or sparse connectivity. With a combination of both, performance can be signiﬁcantly better compared to classical non-sparse approaches.

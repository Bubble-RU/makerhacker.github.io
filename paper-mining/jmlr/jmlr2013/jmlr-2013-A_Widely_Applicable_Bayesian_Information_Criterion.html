<p>Author: Robert Hable</p><p>Abstract: In supervised learning problems, global and local learning algorithms are used. In contrast to global learning algorithms, the prediction of a local learning algorithm in a testing point is only based on training data which are close to the testing point. Every global algorithm such as support vector machines (SVM) can be localized in the following way: in every testing point, the (global) learning algorithm is not applied to the whole training data but only to the k nearest neighbors (kNN) of the testing point. In case of support vector machines, the success of such mixtures of SVM and kNN (called SVM-KNN) has been shown in extensive simulation studies and also for real data sets but only little has been known on theoretical properties so far. In the present article, it is shown how a large class of regularized kernel methods (including SVM) can be localized in order to get a universally consistent learning algorithm.

<p>Author: Arnaud Guyader, Nick Hengartner</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by promising experimental results, this paper investigates the theoretical properties of a recently proposed nonparametric estimator, called the Mutual Nearest Neighbors rule, which estimates the regression function m(x) = E[Y |X = x] as follows: ﬁrst identify the k nearest neighbors of x in the sample Dn , then keep only those for which x is itself one of the k nearest neighbors, and ﬁnally take the average over the corresponding response variables. We prove that this estimator is consistent and that its rate of convergence is optimal. Since the estimate with the optimal rate of convergence depends on the unknown distribution of the observations, we also present adaptation results by data-splitting.

<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Ulrich Paquet, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) provides a framework for approximate inference. When the model under consideration is over a latent Gaussian ﬁeld, with the approximation being Gaussian, we show how these approximations can systematically be corrected. A perturbative expansion is made of the exact but intractable correction, and can be applied to the model’s partition function and other moments of interest. The correction is expressed over the higher-order cumulants which are neglected by EP’s local matching of moments. Through the expansion, we see that EP is correct to ﬁrst order. By considering higher orders, corrections of increasing polynomial complexity can be applied to the approximation. The second order provides a correction in quadratic time, which we apply to an array of Gaussian process and Ising models. The corrections generalize to arbitrarily complex approximating families, which we illustrate on tree-structured Ising model approximations. Furthermore, they provide a polynomial-time assessment of the approximation error. We also provide both theoretical and practical insights on the exactness of the EP solution.

<p>Author: Michael Chertkov, Adam B. Yedidia</p><p>Abstract: We discuss schemes for exact and approximate computations of permanents, and compare them with each other. Speciﬁcally, we analyze the belief propagation (BP) approach and its fractional belief propagation (FBP) generalization for computing the permanent of a non-negative matrix. Known bounds and Conjectures are veriﬁed in experiments, and some new theoretical relations, bounds and Conjectures are proposed. The fractional free energy (FFE) function is parameterized by a scalar parameter γ ∈ [−1; 1], where γ = −1 corresponds to the BP limit and γ = 1 corresponds to the exclusion principle (but ignoring perfect matching constraints) mean-ﬁeld (MF) limit. FFE shows monotonicity and continuity with respect to γ. For every non-negative matrix, we deﬁne its special value γ∗ ∈ [−1; 0] to be the γ for which the minimum of the γ-parameterized FFE function is equal to the permanent of the matrix, where the lower and upper bounds of the γ-interval corresponds to respective bounds for the permanent. Our experimental analysis suggests that the distribution of γ∗ varies for different ensembles but γ∗ always lies within the [−1; −1/2] interval. Moreover, for all ensembles considered, the behavior of γ∗ is highly distinctive, offering an empirical practical guidance for estimating permanents of non-negative matrices via the FFE approach.

<p>Author: Reza Bosagh Zadeh, Ashish Goel</p><p>Abstract: We present a suite of algorithms for Dimension Independent Similarity Computation (DISCO) to compute all pairwise similarities between very high-dimensional sparse vectors. All of our results are provably independent of dimension, meaning that apart from the initial cost of trivially reading in the data, all subsequent operations are independent of the dimension; thus the dimension can be very large. We study Cosine, Dice, Overlap, and the Jaccard similarity measures. For Jaccard similarity we include an improved version of MinHash. Our results are geared toward the MapReduce framework. We empirically validate our theorems with large scale experiments using data from the social networking site Twitter. At time of writing, our algorithms are live in production at twitter.com.

<p>Author: Sumio Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: A statistical model or a learning machine is called regular if the map taking a parameter to a probability distribution is one-to-one and if its Fisher information matrix is always positive deﬁnite. If otherwise, it is called singular. In regular statistical models, the Bayes free energy, which is deﬁned by the minus logarithm of Bayes marginal likelihood, can be asymptotically approximated by the Schwarz Bayes information criterion (BIC), whereas in singular models such approximation does not hold. Recently, it was proved that the Bayes free energy of a singular model is asymptotically given by a generalized formula using a birational invariant, the real log canonical threshold (RLCT), instead of half the number of parameters in BIC. Theoretical values of RLCTs in several statistical models are now being discovered based on algebraic geometrical methodology. However, it has been difﬁcult to estimate the Bayes free energy using only training samples, because an RLCT depends on an unknown true distribution. In the present paper, we deﬁne a widely applicable Bayesian information criterion (WBIC) by the average log likelihood function over the posterior distribution with the inverse temperature 1/ log n, where n is the number of training samples. We mathematically prove that WBIC has the same asymptotic expansion as the Bayes free energy, even if a statistical model is singular for or unrealizable by a statistical model. Since WBIC can be numerically calculated without any information about a true distribution, it is a generalized version of BIC onto singular statistical models.

<p>Author: Indraneel Mukherjee, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: Boosting combines weak classiﬁers to form highly accurate predictors. Although the case of binary classiﬁcation is well understood, in the multiclass setting, the “correct” requirements on the weak classiﬁer, or the notion of the most efﬁcient boosting algorithms are missing. In this paper, we create a broad and general framework, within which we make precise and identify the optimal requirements on the weak-classiﬁer, as well as design the most effective, in a certain sense, boosting algorithms that assume such requirements.

<p>Author: Jaakko Riihimäki, Pasi Jylänki, Aki Vehtari</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers probabilistic multinomial probit classiﬁcation using Gaussian process (GP) priors. Challenges with multiclass GP classiﬁcation are the integration over the non-Gaussian posterior distribution, and the increase of the number of unknown latent variables as the number of target classes grows. Expectation propagation (EP) has proven to be a very accurate method for approximate inference but the existing EP approaches for the multinomial probit GP classiﬁcation rely on numerical quadratures, or independence assumptions between the latent values associated with different classes, to facilitate the computations. In this paper we propose a novel nested EP approach which does not require numerical quadratures, and approximates accurately all betweenclass posterior dependencies of the latent values, but still scales linearly in the number of classes. The predictive accuracy of the nested EP approach is compared to Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximations with various benchmark data sets. In the experiments nested EP was the most consistent method compared to MCMC sampling, but in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy the differences between all the methods were small from a practical point of view.

In this paper, we propose a counter example that rejects their theorem. Keywords: kernel, robustness, support vector machine 1. Comment Firstly, it must be stated that Xu et al. (2009) made a good study of robustness and regularization of support vector machines. They proposed the following theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the feature space and robustness in the sample space directly: Theorem (Xu et al., 2009) Suppose that the kernel function has the form k(x, x′ ) = f ( x − x′ ), with f : R+ → R a decreasing function. Denote by H the RKHS space of k(., .) and φ(.) the corresponding feature mapping. Then we have any x ∈ Rn , w ∈ H and c > 0, sup w, φ(x − δ) = δ ≤c δφ H≤ sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, φ(x) − δφ . The following counter example rejects the mentioned theorem. However, this theorem is a standalone result in the appendix of the paper of Xu et al. (2009), which is not used anywhere else in the paper of Xu et al. (2009). Thus, the main result and all other results of Xu et al. (2009) are not affected in any way. Counter example. Let φ(.) be the feature mapping of Gaussian kernel function. We have φ(x) H = 1. Let w = φ(x). Therefore, w, φ(x) = w H , and sup w, φ(x − δ) = w δ ≤c ∗.

<p>Author: Yu-Feng Li, Ivor W. Tsang, James T. Kwok, Zhi-Hua Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning from weakly labeled data, where labels of the training examples are incomplete. This includes, for example, (i) semi-supervised learning where labels are partially known; (ii) multi-instance learning where labels are implicitly known; and (iii) clustering where labels are completely unknown. Unlike supervised learning, learning with weak labels involves a difﬁcult Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Therefore, it can suffer from poor scalability and may also get stuck in local minimum. In this paper, we focus on SVMs and propose the W ELL SVM via a novel label generation strategy. This leads to a convex relaxation of the original MIP, which is at least as tight as existing convex Semi-Deﬁnite Programming (SDP) relaxations. Moreover, the W ELL SVM can be solved via a sequence of SVM subproblems that are much more scalable than previous convex SDP relaxations. Experiments on three weakly labeled learning tasks, namely, (i) semi-supervised learning; (ii) multi-instance learning for locating regions of interest in content-based information retrieval; and (iii) clustering, clearly demonstrate improved performance, and W ELL SVM is also readily applicable on large data sets.

<p>Author: Jun Wang, Tony Jebara, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods play an increasingly important role in practical machine learning systems, particularly in agnostic settings when no parametric information or other prior knowledge is available about the data distribution. Given the constructed graph represented by a weight matrix, transductive inference is used to propagate known labels to predict the values of all unlabeled vertices. Designing a robust label diffusion algorithm for such graphs is a widely studied problem and various methods have recently been suggested. Many of these can be formalized as regularized function estimation through the minimization of a quadratic cost. However, most existing label diffusion methods minimize a univariate cost with the classiﬁcation function as the only variable of interest. Since the observed labels seed the diffusion process, such univariate frameworks are extremely sensitive to the initial label choice and any label noise. To alleviate the dependency on the initial observed labels, this article proposes a bivariate formulation for graph-based SSL, where both the binary label information and a continuous classiﬁcation function are arguments of the optimization. This bivariate formulation is shown to be equivalent to a linearly constrained Max-Cut problem. Finally an efﬁcient solution via greedy gradient Max-Cut (GGMC) is derived which gradually assigns unlabeled vertices to each class with minimum connectivity. Once convergence guarantees are established, this greedy Max-Cut based SSL is applied on both artiﬁcial and standard benchmark data sets where it obtains superior classiﬁcation accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art SSL methods. Moreover, GGMC shows robustness with respect to the graph construction method and maintains high accuracy over extensive experiments with various edge linking and weighting schemes.

<p>Author: Kenji Fukumizu, Le Song, Arthur Gretton</p><p>Abstract: A kernel method for realizing Bayes’ rule is proposed, based on representations of probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Probabilities are uniquely characterized by the mean of the canonical map to the RKHS. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed in terms of RKHS functions of an empirical sample: no explicit parametric model is needed for these quantities. The posterior is likewise an RKHS mean of a weighted sample. The estimator for the expectation of a function of the posterior is derived, and rates of consistency are shown. Some representative applications of the kernel Bayes’ rule are presented, including Bayesian computation without likelihood and ﬁltering with a nonparametric state-space model.

<p>Author: Yahya Forghani, Hadi Sadoghi</p><p>Abstract: This paper comments on the published work dealing with robustness and regularization of support vector machines (Journal of Machine Learning Research, Vol. 10, pp. 1485-1510, 2009) by H. Xu et al. They proposed a theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the feature space and robustness in the sample space directly. In this paper, we propose a counter example that rejects their theorem. Keywords: kernel, robustness, support vector machine 1. Comment Firstly, it must be stated that Xu et al. (2009) made a good study of robustness and regularization of support vector machines. They proposed the following theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the feature space and robustness in the sample space directly: Theorem (Xu et al., 2009) Suppose that the kernel function has the form k(x, x′ ) = f ( x − x′ ), with f : R+ → R a decreasing function. Denote by H the RKHS space of k(., .) and φ(.) the corresponding feature mapping. Then we have any x ∈ Rn , w ∈ H and c > 0, sup w, φ(x − δ) = δ ≤c δφ H≤ sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, φ(x) − δφ . The following counter example rejects the mentioned theorem. However, this theorem is a standalone result in the appendix of the paper of Xu et al. (2009), which is not used anywhere else in the paper of Xu et al. (2009). Thus, the main result and all other results of Xu et al. (2009) are not affected in any way. Counter example. Let φ(.) be the feature mapping of Gaussian kernel function. We have φ(x) H = 1. Let w = φ(x). Therefore, w, φ(x) = w H , and sup w, φ(x − δ) = w δ ≤c ∗.

(1) F ORGHANI AND S ADOGHI Moreover, δφ δφ H≤ H≤ w, φ(x) − δφ = sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, φ(x) + sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w H δφ + δφ w H H≤ + w H≤ w, δφ = sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, δφ = sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) H 2 f (0) − 2 f (c). (2) According to Equation (1) and (2), and since f is a decreasing function, for any c > 0, we have sup w, φ(x − δ) ≤ δ ≤c δφ H≤ sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, φ(x) − δφ . End of counter example. The exact spot that the error has been occurred in the mentioned theorem is Equation (19) of the paper of Xu et al. (2009). There it has been claimed that the image of the RKHS feature mapping is dense, which unfortunately is not true. Indeed, because φ(x), φ(x) = K(0) where K(.) is the kernel function, the image of the feature mapping is in a ball of radius K(0). References Huan Xu, Shie Mannor, and Constantine Caramanis.

<p>Author: Dana Angluin, James Aspnes, Sarah Eisenstat, Aryeh Kontorovich</p><p>Abstract: PAC learning of unrestricted regular languages is long known to be a difﬁcult problem. The class of shufﬂe ideals is a very restricted subclass of regular languages, where the shufﬂe ideal generated by a string u is the collection of all strings containing u as a subsequence. This fundamental language family is of theoretical interest in its own right and provides the building blocks for other important language families. Despite its apparent simplicity, the class of shufﬂe ideals appears quite difﬁcult to learn. In particular, just as for unrestricted regular languages, the class is not properly PAC learnable in polynomial time if RP = NP, and PAC learning the class improperly in polynomial time would imply polynomial time algorithms for certain fundamental problems in cryptography. In the positive direction, we give an efﬁcient algorithm for properly learning shufﬂe ideals in the statistical query (and therefore also PAC) model under the uniform distribution.

<p>Author: Eva L. Dyer, Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan, Richard G. Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: Unions of subspaces provide a powerful generalization of single subspace models for collections of high-dimensional data; however, learning multiple subspaces from data is challenging due to the fact that segmentation—the identiﬁcation of points that live in the same subspace—and subspace estimation must be performed simultaneously. Recently, sparse recovery methods were shown to provide a provable and robust strategy for exact feature selection (EFS)—recovering subsets of points from the ensemble that live in the same subspace. In parallel with recent studies of EFS with ℓ1 -minimization, in this paper, we develop sufﬁcient conditions for EFS with a greedy method for sparse signal recovery known as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). Following our analysis, we provide an empirical study of feature selection strategies for signals living on unions of subspaces and characterize the gap between sparse recovery methods and nearest neighbor (NN)-based approaches. In particular, we demonstrate that sparse recovery methods provide signiﬁcant advantages over NN methods and that the gap between the two approaches is particularly pronounced when the sampling of subspaces in the data set is sparse. Our results suggest that OMP may be employed to reliably recover exact feature sets in a number of regimes where NN approaches fail to reveal the subspace membership of points in the ensemble.

Overview Blind source separation (BSS) has proven to be a powerful and widely-applicable tool for the analysis and interpretation of composite patterns in engineering and science (Hillman and Moore, 2007; Lee and Seung, 1999). BSS is often described by a linear latent variable model X = AS, where X is the observation data matrix, A is the unknown mixing matrix, and S is the unknown source data matrix. The fundamental objective of BSS is to estimate both the unknown but informative mixing proportions and the source signals based only on the observed mixtures (Child, 2006; Cruces-Alvarez et al., 2004; Hyvarinen et al., 2001; Keshava and Mustard, 2002). While many existing BSS algorithms can usefully extract interesting patterns from mixture observations, they often prove inaccurate or even incorrect in the face of real-world BSS problems in which the pre-imposed assumptions may be invalid. There is a family of approaches exploiting the source non-negativity, including the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (Gillis, 2012; Lee and Seung, 1999). This motivates the development of alternative BSS techniques involving exploitation of source nonnegative nature (Chan et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2011a,b; Wang et al., 2010). The method works by performing convex analysis of mixtures (CAM) that automatically identiﬁes pure-source signals that reside at the vertices of the multifaceted simplex most tightly enclosing the data scatter, enabling geometrically-principled delineation of distinct source patterns from mixtures, with the number of underlying sources being suggested by the minimum description length criterion. Consider a latent variable model x(i) = As(i), where the observation vector x(i) = [x1 (i), ..., xM (i)]T can be expressed as a non-negative linear combination of the source vectors s(i) = [s1 (i), ..., sJ (i)]T , and A = [a1 , ..., aJ ] is the mixing matrix with a j being the jth column vector. This falls neatly within the deﬁnition of a convex set (Fig. 1) (Chen et al., 2011a): X= J J ∑ j=1 s j (i)a j |a j ∈ A, s j (i) ≥ 0, ∑ j=1 s j (i) = 1, i = 1, ..., N . Assume that the sources have at least one sample point whose signal is exclusively enriched in a particular source (Wang et al., 2010), we have shown that the vertex points of the observation simplex (Fig. 1) correspond to the column vectors of the mixing matrix (Chen et al., 2011b). Via a minimum-error-margin volume maximization, CAM identiﬁes the optimum set of the vertices (Chen et al., 2011b; Wang et al., 2010). Using the samples attached to the vertices, compartment modeling (CM) (Chen et al., 2011a) obtains a parametric solution of A, nonnegative independent component analysis (nICA) (Oja and Plumbley, 2004) estimates A (and s) that maximizes the independency in s, and nonnegative well-grounded component analysis (nWCA) (Wang et al., 2010) ﬁnds the column vectors of A directly from the vertex cluster centers. Figure 1: Schematic and illustrative ﬂowchart of R-Java CAM package. 2900 T HE CAM S OFTWARE IN R-JAVA In this paper we describe a newly developed R-Java CAM package whose analytic functions are written in R, while a graphic user interface (GUI) is implemented in Java, taking full advantages of both programming languages. The core software suite implements CAM functions and includes normalization, clustering, and data visualization. Multi-thread interactions between the R and Java modules are driven and integrated by a Java GUI, which not only provides convenient data or parameter passing and visual progress monitoring but also assures the responsive execution of the entire CAM software. 2. Software Design and Implementation The CAM package mainly consists of R and Java modules. The R module is a collection of main and helper functions, each represented by an R function object and achieving an independent and speciﬁc task (Fig. 1). The R module mainly performs various analytic tasks required by CAM: ﬁgure plotting, update, or error message generation. The Java module is developed to provide a GUI (Fig. 2). We adopt the model-view-controller (MVC) design strategy, and use different Java classes to separately perform information visualization and human-computer interaction. The Java module also serves as the software driver and integrator that use a multi-thread strategy to facilitate the interactions between the R and Java modules, such as importing raw data, passing algorithmic parameters, calling R scripts, and transporting results and messages. Figure 2: Interactive Java GUI supported by a multi-thread design strategy. 2.1 Analytic and Presentation Tasks Implemented in R The R module performs the CAM algorithm and facilitates a suite of subsequent analyses including CM, nICA, and nWCA. These tasks are performed by the three main functions: CAM-CM.R, CAM-nICA.R, and CAM-nWCA.R, which can be activated by the three R scripts: Java-runCAM-CM.R, Java-runCAM-ICA.R, and Java-runCAM-nWCA.R. The R module also performs auxiliary tasks including automatic R library installation, ﬁgure drawing, and result recording; and offers other standard methods such as nonnegative matrix factorization (Lee and Seung, 1999), Fast ICA (Hyvarinen et al., 2001), factor analysis (Child, 2006), principal component analysis, afﬁnity propagation, k-means clustering, and expectation-maximization algorithm for learning standard ﬁnite normal mixture model. 2.2 Graphic User Interface Written in Java Swing The Java GUI module allows users to import data, select algorithms and parameters, and display results. The module encloses two packages: guiView contains classes for handling frames and 2901 WANG , M ENG , C HEN , M ADHAVAN , C LARKE , H OFFMAN , X UAN AND WANG Figure 3: Application of R-Java CAM to deconvolving dynamic medical image sequence. dialogs for managing user inputs; guiModel contains classes for representing result data sets and for interacting with the R script caller. Packaged as one jar ﬁle, the GUI module runs automatically. 2.3 Functional Interaction Between R and Java We adopt the open-source program RCaller (http://code.google.com/p/rcaller) to implement the interaction between R and Java modules (Fig. 2), supported by explicitly designed R scripts such as Java-runCAM-CM.R. Speciﬁcally, ﬁve featured Java classes are introduced to interact with R for importing data or parameters, running algorithms, passing on or recording results, displaying ﬁgures, and handing over error messages. The examples of these classes include guiModel.MyRCaller.java, guiModel.MyRCaller.readResults(), and guiView.MyRPlotViewer. 3. Case Studies and Experimental Results The CAM package has been successfully applied to various data types. Using dynamic contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging data set of an advanced breast cancer case (Chen, et al., 2011b),“double click” (or command lines under Ubuntu) activated execution of CAM-Java.jar reveals two biologically interpretable vascular compartments with distinct kinetic patterns: fast clearance in the peripheral “rim” and slow clearance in the inner “core”. These outcomes are consistent with previously reported intratumor heterogeneity (Fig. 3). Angiogenesis is essential to tumor development beyond 1-2mm3 . It has been widely observed that active angiogenesis is often observed in advanced breast tumors occurring in the peripheral “rim” with co-occurrence of inner-core hypoxia. This pattern is largely due to the defective endothelial barrier function and outgrowth blood supply. In another application to natural image mixtures, CAM algorithm successfully recovered the source images in a large number of trials (see Users Manual). 4.

<p>Author: Alexander Clark</p><p>Abstract: Standard models of language learning are concerned with weak learning: the learner, receiving as input only information about the strings in the language, must learn to generalise and to generate the correct, potentially inﬁnite, set of strings generated by some target grammar. Here we deﬁne the corresponding notion of strong learning: the learner, again only receiving strings as input, must learn a grammar that generates the correct set of structures or parse trees. We formalise this using a modiﬁcation of Gold’s identiﬁcation in the limit model, requiring convergence to a grammar that is isomorphic to the target grammar. We take as our starting point a simple learning algorithm for substitutable context-free languages, based on principles of distributional learning, and modify it so that it will converge to a canonical grammar for each language. We prove a corresponding strong learning result for a subclass of context-free grammars.

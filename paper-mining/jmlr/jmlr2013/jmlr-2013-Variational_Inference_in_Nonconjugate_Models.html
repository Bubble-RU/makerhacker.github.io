We develop this technique for a large class of probabilistic models and we demonstrate it with two probabilistic topic models, latent Dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical Dirichlet process topic model. Using stochastic variational inference, we analyze several large collections of documents: 300K articles from Nature, 1.8M articles from The New York Times, and 3.8M articles from Wikipedia. Stochastic inference can easily handle data sets of this size and outperforms traditional variational inference, which can only handle a smaller subset.

In particular we make the following novel contributions: sufﬁcient conditions for which the G-KL objective is differentiable and convex are described; constrained parameterisations of Gaussian covariance that make G-KL methods fast and scalable are provided; the lower bound to the normalisation constant provided by G-KL methods is proven to dominate those provided by local lower bounding methods; complexity and model applicability issues of G-KL versus other Gaussian approximate inference methods are discussed. Numerical results comparing G-KL and other deterministic Gaussian approximate inference methods are presented for: robust Gaussian process regression models with either Student-t or Laplace likelihoods, large scale Bayesian binary logistic regression models, and Bayesian sparse linear models for sequential experimental design.

<p>Author: Matthew J. Johnson, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the ubiquitous Hidden Markov Model for learning from sequential and time-series data. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM’s strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi-Markov modeling, which has been developed mainly in the parametric non-Bayesian setting, to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicit-duration Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden semiMarkov Model (HDP-HSMM) and develop sampling algorithms for efﬁcient posterior inference. The methods we introduce also provide new methods for sampling inference in the ﬁnite Bayesian HSMM. Our modular Gibbs sampling methods can be embedded in samplers for larger hierarchical Bayesian models, adding semi-Markov chain modeling as another tool in the Bayesian inference toolbox. We demonstrate the utility of the HDP-HSMM and our inference methods on both synthetic and real experiments.

<p>Author: Daniel Hernández-Lobato, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, Pierre Dupont</p><p>Abstract: We describe a Bayesian method for group feature selection in linear regression problems. The method is based on a generalized version of the standard spike-and-slab prior distribution which is often used for individual feature selection. Exact Bayesian inference under the prior considered is infeasible for typical regression problems. However, approximate inference can be carried out efﬁciently using Expectation Propagation (EP). A detailed analysis of the generalized spike-and-slab prior shows that it is well suited for regression problems that are sparse at the group level. Furthermore, this prior can be used to introduce prior knowledge about speciﬁc groups of features that are a priori believed to be more relevant. An experimental evaluation compares the performance of the proposed method with those of group LASSO, Bayesian group LASSO, automatic relevance determination and additional variants used for group feature selection. The results of these experiments show that a model based on the generalized spike-and-slab prior and the EP algorithm has state-of-the-art prediction performance in the problems analyzed. Furthermore, this model is also very useful to carry out sequential experimental design (also known as active learning), where the data instances that are most informative are iteratively included in the training set, reducing the number of instances needed to obtain a particular level of prediction accuracy.

<p>Author: Arto Klami, Seppo Virtanen, Samuel Kaski</p><p>Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a classical method for seeking correlations between two multivariate data sets. During the last ten years, it has received more and more attention in the machine learning community in the form of novel computational formulations and a plethora of applications. We review recent developments in Bayesian models and inference methods for CCA which are attractive for their potential in hierarchical extensions and for coping with the combination of large dimensionalities and small sample sizes. The existing methods have not been particularly successful in fulﬁlling the promise yet; we introduce a novel efﬁcient solution that imposes group-wise sparsity to estimate the posterior of an extended model which not only extracts the statistical dependencies (correlations) between data sets but also decomposes the data into shared and data set-speciﬁc components. In statistics literature the model is known as inter-battery factor analysis (IBFA), for which we now provide a Bayesian treatment.

<p>Author: Samuel Gerber, Ross Whitaker</p><p>Abstract: Principal curves and manifolds provide a framework to formulate manifold learning within a statistical context. Principal curves deﬁne the notion of a curve passing through the middle of a distribution. While the intuition is clear, the formal deﬁnition leads to some technical and practical difﬁculties. In particular, principal curves are saddle points of the mean-squared projection distance, which poses severe challenges for estimation and model selection. This paper demonstrates that the difﬁculties in model selection associated with the saddle point property of principal curves are intrinsically tied to the minimization of the mean-squared projection distance. We introduce a new objective function, facilitated through a modiﬁcation of the principal curve estimation approach, for which all critical points are principal curves and minima. Thus, the new formulation removes the fundamental issue for model selection in principal curve estimation. A gradient-descent-based estimator demonstrates the effectiveness of the new formulation for controlling model complexity on numerical experiments with synthetic and real data.

<p>Author: Chong Wang, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: Mean-ﬁeld variational methods are widely used for approximate posterior inference in many probabilistic models. In a typical application, mean-ﬁeld methods approximately compute the posterior with a coordinate-ascent optimization algorithm. When the model is conditionally conjugate, the coordinate updates are easily derived and in closed form. However, many models of interest—like the correlated topic model and Bayesian logistic regression—are nonconjugate. In these models, mean-ﬁeld methods cannot be directly applied and practitioners have had to develop variational algorithms on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we develop two generic methods for nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for speciﬁc models; and they work well on real-world data sets. We studied our methods on the correlated topic model, Bayesian logistic regression, and hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression.

<p>Author: Rob Hall, Alessandro Rinaldo, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: Differential privacy is a rigorous cryptographically-motivated characterization of data privacy which may be applied when releasing summaries of a database. Previous work has focused mainly on methods for which the output is a ﬁnite dimensional vector, or an element of some discrete set. We develop methods for releasing functions while preserving differential privacy. Speciﬁcally, we show that adding an appropriate Gaussian process to the function of interest yields differential privacy. When the functions lie in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) generated by the covariance kernel of the Gaussian process, then the correct noise level is established by measuring the “sensitivity” of the function in the RKHS norm. As examples we consider kernel density estimation, kernel support vector machines, and functions in RKHSs.

<p>Author: Matthew D. Hoffman, David M. Blei, Chong Wang, John Paisley</p><p>Abstract: We develop stochastic variational inference, a scalable algorithm for approximating posterior distributions. We develop this technique for a large class of probabilistic models and we demonstrate it with two probabilistic topic models, latent Dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical Dirichlet process topic model. Using stochastic variational inference, we analyze several large collections of documents: 300K articles from Nature, 1.8M articles from The New York Times, and 3.8M articles from Wikipedia. Stochastic inference can easily handle data sets of this size and outperforms traditional variational inference, which can only handle a smaller subset. (We also show that the Bayesian nonparametric topic model outperforms its parametric counterpart.) Stochastic variational inference lets us apply complex Bayesian models to massive data sets.

<p>Author: Kris De Brabanter, Jos De Brabanter, Bart De Moor, Irène Gijbels</p><p>Abstract: We present a fully automated framework to estimate derivatives nonparametrically without estimating the regression function. Derivative estimation plays an important role in the exploration of structures in curves (jump detection and discontinuities), comparison of regression curves, analysis of human growth data, etc. Hence, the study of estimating derivatives is equally important as regression estimation itself. Via empirical derivatives we approximate the qth order derivative and create a new data set which can be smoothed by any nonparametric regression estimator. We derive L1 and L2 rates and establish consistency of the estimator. The new data sets created by this technique are no longer independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables anymore. As a consequence, automated model selection criteria (data-driven procedures) break down. Therefore, we propose a simple factor method, based on bimodal kernels, to effectively deal with correlated data in the local polynomial regression framework.

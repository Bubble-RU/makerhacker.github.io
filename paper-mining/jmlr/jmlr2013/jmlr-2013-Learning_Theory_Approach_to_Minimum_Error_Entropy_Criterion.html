<p>Author: Kris De Brabanter, Jos De Brabanter, Bart De Moor, Irène Gijbels</p><p>Abstract: We present a fully automated framework to estimate derivatives nonparametrically without estimating the regression function. Derivative estimation plays an important role in the exploration of structures in curves (jump detection and discontinuities), comparison of regression curves, analysis of human growth data, etc. Hence, the study of estimating derivatives is equally important as regression estimation itself. Via empirical derivatives we approximate the qth order derivative and create a new data set which can be smoothed by any nonparametric regression estimator. We derive L1 and L2 rates and establish consistency of the estimator. The new data sets created by this technique are no longer independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables anymore. As a consequence, automated model selection criteria (data-driven procedures) break down. Therefore, we propose a simple factor method, based on bimodal kernels, to effectively deal with correlated data in the local polynomial regression framework.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko, Jérémie Mary</p><p>Abstract: A metric between time-series distributions is proposed that can be evaluated using binary classiﬁcation methods, which were originally developed to work on i.i.d. data. It is shown how this metric can be used for solving statistical problems that are seemingly unrelated to classiﬁcation and concern highly dependent time series. Speciﬁcally, the problems of time-series clustering, homogeneity testing and the three-sample problem are addressed. Universal consistency of the resulting algorithms is proven under most general assumptions. The theoretical results are illustrated with experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

<p>Author: Tony Cai, Wen-Xin Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We consider in this paper the problem of noisy 1-bit matrix completion under a general non-uniform sampling distribution using the max-norm as a convex relaxation for the rank. A max-norm constrained maximum likelihood estimate is introduced and studied. The rate of convergence for the estimate is obtained. Information-theoretical methods are used to establish a minimax lower bound under the general sampling model. The minimax upper and lower bounds together yield the optimal rate of convergence for the Frobenius norm loss. Computational algorithms and numerical performance are also discussed.

<p>Author: Ming-Jie Zhao, Narayanan Edakunni, Adam Pocock, Gavin Brown</p><p>Abstract: Fano’s inequality lower bounds the probability of transmission error through a communication channel. Applied to classiﬁcation problems, it provides a lower bound on the Bayes error rate and motivates the widely used Infomax principle. In modern machine learning, we are often interested in more than just the error rate. In medical diagnosis, different errors incur different cost; hence, the overall risk is cost-sensitive. Two other popular criteria are balanced error rate (BER) and F-score. In this work, we focus on the two-class problem and use a general deﬁnition of conditional entropy (including Shannon’s as a special case) to derive upper/lower bounds on the optimal F-score, BER and cost-sensitive risk, extending Fano’s result. As a consequence, we show that Infomax is not suitable for optimizing F-score or cost-sensitive risk, in that it can potentially lead to low F-score and high risk. For cost-sensitive risk, we propose a new conditional entropy formulation which avoids this inconsistency. In addition, we consider the common practice of using a threshold on the posterior probability to tune performance of a classiﬁer. As is widely known, a threshold of 0.5, where the posteriors cross, minimizes error rate—we derive similar optimal thresholds for F-score and BER.

<p>Author: Aleksandrs Slivkins, Filip Radlinski, Sreenivas Gollapudi</p><p>Abstract: Most learning to rank research has assumed that the utility of different documents is independent, which results in learned ranking functions that return redundant results. The few approaches that avoid this have rather unsatisfyingly lacked theoretical foundations, or do not scale. We present a learning-to-rank formulation that optimizes the fraction of satisﬁed users, with several scalable algorithms that explicitly takes document similarity and ranking context into account. Our formulation is a non-trivial common generalization of two multi-armed bandit models from the literature: ranked bandits (Radlinski et al., 2008) and Lipschitz bandits (Kleinberg et al., 2008b). We present theoretical justiﬁcations for this approach, as well as a near-optimal algorithm. Our evaluation adds optimizations that improve empirical performance, and shows that our algorithms learn orders of magnitude more quickly than previous approaches.

<p>Author: Ting Hu, Jun Fan, Qiang Wu, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We consider the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion and an empirical risk minimization learning algorithm when an approximation of R´ nyi’s entropy (of order 2) by Parzen windowing is e minimized. This learning algorithm involves a Parzen windowing scaling parameter. We present a learning theory approach for this MEE algorithm in a regression setting when the scaling parameter is large. Consistency and explicit convergence rates are provided in terms of the approximation ability and capacity of the involved hypothesis space. Novel analysis is carried out for the generalization error associated with R´ nyi’s entropy and a Parzen windowing function, to overcome e technical difﬁculties arising from the essential differences between the classical least squares problems and the MEE setting. An involved symmetrized least squares error is introduced and analyzed, which is related to some ranking algorithms.

<p>Author: Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: Manifold regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) is a geometrically motivated framework for machine learning within which several semi-supervised algorithms have been constructed. Here we try to provide some theoretical understanding of this approach. Our main result is to expose the natural structure of a class of problems on which manifold regularization methods are helpful. We show that for such problems, no supervised learner can learn effectively. On the other hand, a manifold based learner (that knows the manifold or “learns” it from unlabeled examples) can learn with relatively few labeled examples. Our analysis follows a minimax style with an emphasis on ﬁnite sample results (in terms of n: the number of labeled examples). These results allow us to properly interpret manifold regularization and related spectral and geometric algorithms in terms of their potential use in semi-supervised learning.

<p>Author: Yu-Feng Li, Ivor W. Tsang, James T. Kwok, Zhi-Hua Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning from weakly labeled data, where labels of the training examples are incomplete. This includes, for example, (i) semi-supervised learning where labels are partially known; (ii) multi-instance learning where labels are implicitly known; and (iii) clustering where labels are completely unknown. Unlike supervised learning, learning with weak labels involves a difﬁcult Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Therefore, it can suffer from poor scalability and may also get stuck in local minimum. In this paper, we focus on SVMs and propose the W ELL SVM via a novel label generation strategy. This leads to a convex relaxation of the original MIP, which is at least as tight as existing convex Semi-Deﬁnite Programming (SDP) relaxations. Moreover, the W ELL SVM can be solved via a sequence of SVM subproblems that are much more scalable than previous convex SDP relaxations. Experiments on three weakly labeled learning tasks, namely, (i) semi-supervised learning; (ii) multi-instance learning for locating regions of interest in content-based information retrieval; and (iii) clustering, clearly demonstrate improved performance, and W ELL SVM is also readily applicable on large data sets.

<p>Author: Tony Cai, Wen-Xin Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We consider in this paper the problem of noisy 1-bit matrix completion under a general non-uniform sampling distribution using the max-norm as a convex relaxation for the rank. A max-norm constrained maximum likelihood estimate is introduced and studied. The rate of convergence for the estimate is obtained. Information-theoretical methods are used to establish a minimax lower bound under the general sampling model. The minimax upper and lower bounds together yield the optimal rate of convergence for the Frobenius norm loss. Computational algorithms and numerical performance are also discussed.

<p>Author: Daniel Hernández-Lobato, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, Pierre Dupont</p><p>Abstract: We describe a Bayesian method for group feature selection in linear regression problems. The method is based on a generalized version of the standard spike-and-slab prior distribution which is often used for individual feature selection. Exact Bayesian inference under the prior considered is infeasible for typical regression problems. However, approximate inference can be carried out efﬁciently using Expectation Propagation (EP). A detailed analysis of the generalized spike-and-slab prior shows that it is well suited for regression problems that are sparse at the group level. Furthermore, this prior can be used to introduce prior knowledge about speciﬁc groups of features that are a priori believed to be more relevant. An experimental evaluation compares the performance of the proposed method with those of group LASSO, Bayesian group LASSO, automatic relevance determination and additional variants used for group feature selection. The results of these experiments show that a model based on the generalized spike-and-slab prior and the EP algorithm has state-of-the-art prediction performance in the problems analyzed. Furthermore, this model is also very useful to carry out sequential experimental design (also known as active learning), where the data instances that are most informative are iteratively included in the training set, reducing the number of instances needed to obtain a particular level of prediction accuracy.

<p>Author: Chong Wang, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: Mean-ﬁeld variational methods are widely used for approximate posterior inference in many probabilistic models. In a typical application, mean-ﬁeld methods approximately compute the posterior with a coordinate-ascent optimization algorithm. When the model is conditionally conjugate, the coordinate updates are easily derived and in closed form. However, many models of interest—like the correlated topic model and Bayesian logistic regression—are nonconjugate. In these models, mean-ﬁeld methods cannot be directly applied and practitioners have had to develop variational algorithms on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we develop two generic methods for nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for speciﬁc models; and they work well on real-world data sets. We studied our methods on the correlated topic model, Bayesian logistic regression, and hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression.

<p>Author: Matthew D. Hoffman, David M. Blei, Chong Wang, John Paisley</p><p>Abstract: We develop stochastic variational inference, a scalable algorithm for approximating posterior distributions. We develop this technique for a large class of probabilistic models and we demonstrate it with two probabilistic topic models, latent Dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical Dirichlet process topic model. Using stochastic variational inference, we analyze several large collections of documents: 300K articles from Nature, 1.8M articles from The New York Times, and 3.8M articles from Wikipedia. Stochastic inference can easily handle data sets of this size and outperforms traditional variational inference, which can only handle a smaller subset. (We also show that the Bayesian nonparametric topic model outperforms its parametric counterpart.) Stochastic variational inference lets us apply complex Bayesian models to massive data sets.

<p>Author: Edward Challis, David Barber</p><p>Abstract: We investigate Gaussian Kullback-Leibler (G-KL) variational approximate inference techniques for Bayesian generalised linear models and various extensions. In particular we make the following novel contributions: sufﬁcient conditions for which the G-KL objective is differentiable and convex are described; constrained parameterisations of Gaussian covariance that make G-KL methods fast and scalable are provided; the lower bound to the normalisation constant provided by G-KL methods is proven to dominate those provided by local lower bounding methods; complexity and model applicability issues of G-KL versus other Gaussian approximate inference methods are discussed. Numerical results comparing G-KL and other deterministic Gaussian approximate inference methods are presented for: robust Gaussian process regression models with either Student-t or Laplace likelihoods, large scale Bayesian binary logistic regression models, and Bayesian sparse linear models for sequential experimental design.

<p>Author: Kenji Fukumizu, Le Song, Arthur Gretton</p><p>Abstract: A kernel method for realizing Bayes’ rule is proposed, based on representations of probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Probabilities are uniquely characterized by the mean of the canonical map to the RKHS. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed in terms of RKHS functions of an empirical sample: no explicit parametric model is needed for these quantities. The posterior is likewise an RKHS mean of a weighted sample. The estimator for the expectation of a function of the posterior is derived, and rates of consistency are shown. Some representative applications of the kernel Bayes’ rule are presented, including Bayesian computation without likelihood and ﬁltering with a nonparametric state-space model.

<p>Author: Matthew J. Johnson, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the ubiquitous Hidden Markov Model for learning from sequential and time-series data. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM’s strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi-Markov modeling, which has been developed mainly in the parametric non-Bayesian setting, to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicit-duration Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden semiMarkov Model (HDP-HSMM) and develop sampling algorithms for efﬁcient posterior inference. The methods we introduce also provide new methods for sampling inference in the ﬁnite Bayesian HSMM. Our modular Gibbs sampling methods can be embedded in samplers for larger hierarchical Bayesian models, adding semi-Markov chain modeling as another tool in the Bayesian inference toolbox. We demonstrate the utility of the HDP-HSMM and our inference methods on both synthetic and real experiments.

<p>Author: Anastasios Roussos, Stavros Theodorakis, Vassilis Pitsikalis, Petros Maragos</p><p>Abstract: We propose the novel approach of dynamic afﬁne-invariant shape-appearance model (Aff-SAM) and employ it for handshape classiﬁcation and sign recognition in sign language (SL) videos. AffSAM offers a compact and descriptive representation of hand conﬁgurations as well as regularized model-ﬁtting, assisting hand tracking and extracting handshape features. We construct SA images representing the hand’s shape and appearance without landmark points. We model the variation of the images by linear combinations of eigenimages followed by afﬁne transformations, accounting for 3D hand pose changes and improving model’s compactness. We also incorporate static and dynamic handshape priors, offering robustness in occlusions, which occur often in signing. The approach includes an afﬁne signer adaptation component at the visual level, without requiring training from scratch a new singer-speciﬁc model. We rather employ a short development data set to adapt the models for a new signer. Experiments on the Boston-University-400 continuous SL corpus demonstrate improvements on handshape classiﬁcation when compared to other feature extraction approaches. Supplementary evaluations of sign recognition experiments, are conducted on a multi-signer, 100-sign data set, from the Greek sign language lemmas corpus. These explore the fusion with movement cues as well as signer adaptation of Aff-SAM to multiple signers providing promising results.

In statistics literature the model is known as inter-battery factor analysis (IBFA), for which we now provide a Bayesian treatment.

<p>Author: Pierre Alquier, Gérard Biau</p><p>Abstract: Let (X,Y ) be a random pair taking values in R p × R. In the so-called single-index model, one has Y = f ⋆ (θ⋆T X) +W , where f ⋆ is an unknown univariate measurable function, θ⋆ is an unknown vector in Rd , and W denotes a random noise satisfying E[W |X] = 0. The single-index model is known to offer a ﬂexible way to model a variety of high-dimensional real-world phenomena. However, despite its relative simplicity, this dimension reduction scheme is faced with severe complications as soon as the underlying dimension becomes larger than the number of observations (“p larger than n” paradigm). To circumvent this difﬁculty, we consider the single-index model estimation problem from a sparsity perspective using a PAC-Bayesian approach. On the theoretical side, we offer a sharp oracle inequality, which is more powerful than the best known oracle inequalities for other common procedures of single-index recovery. The proposed method is implemented by means of the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique and its performance is compared with that of standard procedures.

<p>Author: Philipp Hennig, Martin Kiefel</p><p>Abstract: Four decades after their invention, quasi-Newton methods are still state of the art in unconstrained numerical optimization. Although not usually interpreted thus, these are learning algorithms that ﬁt a local quadratic approximation to the objective function. We show that many, including the most popular, quasi-Newton methods can be interpreted as approximations of Bayesian linear regression under varying prior assumptions. This new notion elucidates some shortcomings of classical algorithms, and lights the way to a novel nonparametric quasi-Newton method, which is able to make more efﬁcient use of available information at computational cost similar to its predecessors.

<p>Author: Matthew J. Johnson, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the ubiquitous Hidden Markov Model for learning from sequential and time-series data. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM’s strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi-Markov modeling, which has been developed mainly in the parametric non-Bayesian setting, to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicit-duration Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden semiMarkov Model (HDP-HSMM) and develop sampling algorithms for efﬁcient posterior inference. The methods we introduce also provide new methods for sampling inference in the ﬁnite Bayesian HSMM. Our modular Gibbs sampling methods can be embedded in samplers for larger hierarchical Bayesian models, adding semi-Markov chain modeling as another tool in the Bayesian inference toolbox. We demonstrate the utility of the HDP-HSMM and our inference methods on both synthetic and real experiments.

<p>Author: Philémon Brakel, Dirk Stroobandt, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Imputing missing values in high dimensional time-series is a difﬁcult problem. This paper presents a strategy for training energy-based graphical models for imputation directly, bypassing difﬁculties probabilistic approaches would face. The training strategy is inspired by recent work on optimization-based learning (Domke, 2012) and allows complex neural models with convolutional and recurrent structures to be trained for imputation tasks. In this work, we use this training strategy to derive learning rules for three substantially different neural architectures. Inference in these models is done by either truncated gradient descent or variational mean-ﬁeld iterations. In our experiments, we found that the training methods outperform the Contrastive Divergence learning algorithm. Moreover, the training methods can easily handle missing values in the training data itself during learning. We demonstrate the performance of this learning scheme and the three models we introduce on one artiﬁcial and two real-world data sets.

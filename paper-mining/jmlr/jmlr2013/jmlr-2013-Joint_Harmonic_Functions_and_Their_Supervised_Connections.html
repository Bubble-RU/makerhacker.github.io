<p>Author: Jun Wang, Tony Jebara, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods play an increasingly important role in practical machine learning systems, particularly in agnostic settings when no parametric information or other prior knowledge is available about the data distribution. Given the constructed graph represented by a weight matrix, transductive inference is used to propagate known labels to predict the values of all unlabeled vertices. Designing a robust label diffusion algorithm for such graphs is a widely studied problem and various methods have recently been suggested. Many of these can be formalized as regularized function estimation through the minimization of a quadratic cost. However, most existing label diffusion methods minimize a univariate cost with the classiﬁcation function as the only variable of interest. Since the observed labels seed the diffusion process, such univariate frameworks are extremely sensitive to the initial label choice and any label noise. To alleviate the dependency on the initial observed labels, this article proposes a bivariate formulation for graph-based SSL, where both the binary label information and a continuous classiﬁcation function are arguments of the optimization. This bivariate formulation is shown to be equivalent to a linearly constrained Max-Cut problem. Finally an efﬁcient solution via greedy gradient Max-Cut (GGMC) is derived which gradually assigns unlabeled vertices to each class with minimum connectivity. Once convergence guarantees are established, this greedy Max-Cut based SSL is applied on both artiﬁcial and standard benchmark data sets where it obtains superior classiﬁcation accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art SSL methods. Moreover, GGMC shows robustness with respect to the graph construction method and maintains high accuracy over extensive experiments with various edge linking and weighting schemes.

<p>Author: Yu-Feng Li, Ivor W. Tsang, James T. Kwok, Zhi-Hua Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning from weakly labeled data, where labels of the training examples are incomplete. This includes, for example, (i) semi-supervised learning where labels are partially known; (ii) multi-instance learning where labels are implicitly known; and (iii) clustering where labels are completely unknown. Unlike supervised learning, learning with weak labels involves a difﬁcult Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Therefore, it can suffer from poor scalability and may also get stuck in local minimum. In this paper, we focus on SVMs and propose the W ELL SVM via a novel label generation strategy. This leads to a convex relaxation of the original MIP, which is at least as tight as existing convex Semi-Deﬁnite Programming (SDP) relaxations. Moreover, the W ELL SVM can be solved via a sequence of SVM subproblems that are much more scalable than previous convex SDP relaxations. Experiments on three weakly labeled learning tasks, namely, (i) semi-supervised learning; (ii) multi-instance learning for locating regions of interest in content-based information retrieval; and (iii) clustering, clearly demonstrate improved performance, and W ELL SVM is also readily applicable on large data sets.

<p>Author: Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: Manifold regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) is a geometrically motivated framework for machine learning within which several semi-supervised algorithms have been constructed. Here we try to provide some theoretical understanding of this approach. Our main result is to expose the natural structure of a class of problems on which manifold regularization methods are helpful. We show that for such problems, no supervised learner can learn effectively. On the other hand, a manifold based learner (that knows the manifold or “learns” it from unlabeled examples) can learn with relatively few labeled examples. Our analysis follows a minimax style with an emphasis on ﬁnite sample results (in terms of n: the number of labeled examples). These results allow us to properly interpret manifold regularization and related spectral and geometric algorithms in terms of their potential use in semi-supervised learning.

We study its large sample limit, providing speciﬁc rates of convergence under standard assumptions.

<p>Author: Alon Gonen, Sivan Sabato, Shai Shalev-Shwartz</p><p>Abstract: We study pool-based active learning of half-spaces. We revisit the aggressive approach for active learning in the realizable case, and show that it can be made efﬁcient and practical, while also having theoretical guarantees under reasonable assumptions. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that it can be preferable to mellow approaches. Our efﬁcient aggressive active learner of half-spaces has formal approximation guarantees that hold when the pool is separable with a margin. While our analysis is focused on the realizable setting, we show that a simple heuristic allows using the same algorithm successfully for pools with low error as well. We further compare the aggressive approach to the mellow approach, and prove that there are cases in which the aggressive approach results in signiﬁcantly better label complexity compared to the mellow approach. We demonstrate experimentally that substantial improvements in label complexity can be achieved using the aggressive approach, for both realizable and low-error settings.

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Fabio Vitale, Giovanni Zappella</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of sequentially predicting the binary labels on the nodes of an arbitrary weighted graph. We show that, under a suitable parametrization of the problem, the optimal number of prediction mistakes can be characterized (up to logarithmic factors) by the cutsize of a random spanning tree of the graph. The cutsize is induced by the unknown adversarial labeling of the graph nodes. In deriving our characterization, we obtain a simple randomized algorithm achieving in expectation the optimal mistake bound on any polynomially connected weighted graph. Our algorithm draws a random spanning tree of the original graph and then predicts the nodes of this tree in constant expected amortized time and linear space. Experiments on real-world data sets show that our method compares well to both global (Perceptron) and local (label propagation) methods, while being generally faster in practice.

<p>Author: Ryan R. Curtin, James R. Cline, N. P. Slagle, William B. March, Parikshit Ram, Nishant A. Mehta, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: MLPACK is a state-of-the-art, scalable, multi-platform C++ machine learning library released in late 2011 offering both a simple, consistent API accessible to novice users and high performance and ﬂexibility to expert users by leveraging modern features of C++. MLPACK provides cutting-edge algorithms whose benchmarks exhibit far better performance than other leading machine learning libraries. MLPACK version 1.0.3, licensed under the LGPL, is available at http://www.mlpack.org. Keywords: C++, dual-tree algorithms, machine learning software, open source software, largescale learning 1. Introduction and Goals Though several machine learning libraries are freely available online, few, if any, offer efﬁcient algorithms to the average user. For instance, the popular Weka toolkit (Hall et al., 2009) emphasizes ease of use but scales poorly; the distributed Apache Mahout library offers scalability at a cost of higher overhead (such as clusters and powerful servers often unavailable to the average user). Also, few libraries offer breadth; for instance, libsvm (Chang and Lin, 2011) and the Tilburg MemoryBased Learner (TiMBL) are highly scalable and accessible yet each offer only a single method. MLPACK, intended to be the machine learning analog to the general-purpose LAPACK linear algebra library, aims to combine efﬁciency and accessibility. Written in C++, MLPACK uses the highly efﬁcient Armadillo matrix library (Sanderson, 2010) and is freely available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Through the use of C++ templates, MLPACK both eliminates unnecessary copying of data sets and performs expression optimizations unavailable in other languages. Also, MLPACK is, to our knowledge, unique among existing libraries in using generic programming features of C++ to allow customization of the available machine learning methods without incurring performance penalties. c 2013 Ryan R. Curtin, James R. Cline, N. P. Slagle, William B. March, Parikshit Ram, Nishant A. Mehta and Alexander G. Gray. C URTIN , C LINE , S LAGLE , M ARCH , R AM , M EHTA AND G RAY In addition, users ranging from students to experts should ﬁnd the consistent, intuitive interface of MLPACK to be highly accessible. Finally, the source code provides references and comprehensive documentation. Four major goals of the development team of MLPACK are • • • • to implement scalable, fast machine learning algorithms, to design an intuitive, consistent, and simple API for non-expert users, to implement a variety of machine learning methods, and to provide cutting-edge machine learning algorithms unavailable elsewhere. This paper offers both an introduction to the simple and extensible API and a glimpse of the superior performance of the library. 2. Package Overview Each algorithm available in MLPACK features both a set of C++ library functions and a standalone command-line executable. Version 1.0.3 includes the following methods: • • • • • • • • • • • • • • nearest/furthest neighbor search with cover trees or kd-trees (k-nearest-neighbors) range search with cover trees or kd-trees Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) hidden Markov models (HMMs) LARS / Lasso regression k-means clustering fast hierarchical clustering (Euclidean MST calculation)1 (March et al., 2010) kernel PCA (and regular PCA) local coordinate coding1 (Yu et al., 2009) sparse coding using dictionary learning RADICAL (Robust, Accurate, Direct ICA aLgorithm) (Learned-Miller and Fisher, 2003) maximum variance unfolding (MVU) via LRSDP1 (Burer and Monteiro, 2003) the naive Bayes classiﬁer density estimation trees1 (Ram and Gray, 2011) The development team manages MLPACK with Subversion and the Trac bug reporting system, allowing easy downloads and simple bug reporting. The entire development process is transparent, so any interested user can easily contribute to the library. MLPACK can compile from source on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows; currently, different Linux distributions are reviewing MLPACK for inclusion in their package managers, which will allow users to install MLPACK without needing to compile from source. 3. A Consistent, Simple API MLPACK features a highly accessible API, both in style (such as consistent naming schemes and coding conventions) and ease of use (such as templated defaults), as well as stringent documentation standards. Consequently, a new user can execute algorithms out-of-the-box often with little or no adjustment to parameters, while the seasoned expert can expect extreme ﬂexibility in algorithmic 1.

It is primarily designed to deal with custom kernels that are not easily found in standard libraries, such as kernels on structured data. These types of kernels are often used in computer vision or bioinformatics applications. We provide several kernels leading to state of the art classiﬁcation performances in computer vision, as well as various kernels on sets. The main focus of the library is to be easily extended with new kernels. Standard SVM optimization algorithms are available, but also more sophisticated learning-based kernel combination methods such as Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL), and a recently published algorithm to learn powered products of similarities (Product Kernel Learning).

<p>Author: Mark Vere Culp, Kenneth Joseph Ryan</p><p>Abstract: The cluster assumption had a signiﬁcant impact on the reasoning behind semi-supervised classiﬁcation methods in graph-based learning. The literature includes numerous applications where harmonic functions provided estimates that conformed to data satisfying this well-known assumption, but the relationship between this assumption and harmonic functions is not as well-understood theoretically. We investigate these matters from the perspective of supervised kernel classiﬁcation and provide concrete answers to two fundamental questions. (i) Under what conditions do semisupervised harmonic approaches satisfy this assumption? (ii) If such an assumption is satisﬁed then why precisely would an observation sacriﬁce its own supervised estimate in favor of the cluster? First, a harmonic function is guaranteed to assign labels to data in harmony with the cluster assumption if a speciﬁc condition on the boundary of the harmonic function is satisﬁed. Second, it is shown that any harmonic function estimate within the interior is a probability weighted average of supervised estimates, where the weight is focused on supervised kernel estimates near labeled cases. We demonstrate that the uniqueness criterion for harmonic estimators is sensitive when the graph is sparse or the size of the boundary is relatively small. This sets the stage for a third contribution, a new regularized joint harmonic function for semi-supervised learning based on a joint optimization criterion. Mathematical properties of this estimator, such as its uniqueness even when the graph is sparse or the size of the boundary is relatively small, are proven. A main selling point is its ability to operate in circumstances where the cluster assumption may not be fully satisﬁed on real data by compromising between the purely harmonic and purely supervised estimators. The competitive stature of the new regularized joint harmonic approach is established.

<p>Author: Qiang Liu, Alexander Ihler</p><p>Abstract: The marginal maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem, which calculates the mode of the marginal posterior distribution of a subset of variables with the remaining variables marginalized, is an important inference problem in many models, such as those with hidden variables or uncertain parameters. Unfortunately, marginal MAP can be NP-hard even on trees, and has attracted less attention in the literature compared to the joint MAP (maximization) and marginalization problems. We derive a general dual representation for marginal MAP that naturally integrates the marginalization and maximization operations into a joint variational optimization problem, making it possible to easily extend most or all variational-based algorithms to marginal MAP. In particular, we derive a set of “mixed-product” message passing algorithms for marginal MAP, whose form is a hybrid of max-product, sum-product and a novel “argmax-product” message updates. We also derive a class of convergent algorithms based on proximal point methods, including one that transforms the marginal MAP problem into a sequence of standard marginalization problems. Theoretically, we provide guarantees under which our algorithms give globally or locally optimal solutions, and provide novel upper bounds on the optimal objectives. Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms signiﬁcantly outperform the existing approaches, including a state-of-the-art algorithm based on local search methods.

<p>Author: Hervé Frezza-Buet, Matthieu Geist</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces the rllib as an original C++ template-based library oriented toward value function estimation. Generic programming is promoted here as a way of having a good ﬁt between the mathematics of reinforcement learning and their implementation in a library. The main concepts of rllib are presented, as well as a short example. Keywords: reinforcement learning, C++, generic programming 1. C++ Genericity for Fitting the Mathematics of Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning (RL) is a ﬁeld of machine learning that beneﬁts from a rigorous mathematical formalism, as shown for example by Bertsekas (1995). Although this formalism is well accepted in the ﬁeld, its translation into efﬁcient computer science tools has surprisingly not led to any standard yet, as mentioned by Kovacs and Egginton (2011). The claim of this paper is that genericity enables a natural expression of the mathematics of RL. The rllib (2011) library implements this idea in the C++ language, where genericity relies on templates. Templates automate the re-writing of some generic code involving user types, offering a strong type checking at compile time that improves the code safety. Using the rllib templates requires that the user-deﬁned types ﬁt some documented concepts. For example, some class C deﬁning an agent should be designed so that C::state type is the type used for the states, C::action type is the type used for the actions, and the method C::action type policy(const C::state type& s) const is implemented, in order to compute the action to be performed in a given state. This concept deﬁnition speciﬁes what is required for an agent mathematically. Note that C does not need to inherit from any kind of abstract rl::Agent class to be used by the rllib tools. It can be directly provided as a type argument to any rllib template requiring an argument ﬁtting the concept of an agent, so that the re-written code actually compiles. 2. A Short Example Let us consider the following toy-example. The state space contains values from 0 to 9, and actions consist in increasing or decreasing the value. When the value gets out of bounds, a reward is returned ∗. Also at UMI 2958 Georgia Tech / CNRS, 2-3, rue Marconi, 57070 Metz, France. c 2013 Herv´ Frezza-Buet and Matthieu Geist. e F REZZA -B UET AND G EIST (-1 for bound 0, 1 for bound 9). Otherwise, a null reward is returned. Let us deﬁne this problem and run Sarsa. First, a simulator class ﬁtting the concept Simulator described in the documentation is needed. c l a s s Sim { / / Our s i m u l a t o r c l a s s . No i n h e r i t a n c e r e q u i r e d . private : i n t c u r r e n t ; double r ; public : typedef int phase type ; typedef int observation type ; t y p e d e f enum { up , down} a c t i o n t y p e ; t y p e d e f d o u b l e r e w a r d t y p e ; Sim ( v o i d ) : c u r r e n t ( 0 ) , r ( 0 ) {} v o i d s e t P h a s e ( c o n s t p h a s e t y p e &s; ) { c u r r e n t = s %10;} c o n s t o b s e r v a t i o n t y p e& s e n s e ( v o i d ) c o n s t { r e t u r n c u r r e n t ; } reward type reward ( void ) const { return r ;} v o i d t i m e S t e p ( c o n s t a c t i o n t y p e &a; ) { i f ( a == up ) c u r r e n t ++; e l s e c u r r e n t −−; i f ( c u r r e n t < 0 ) r =−1; e l s e i f ( c u r r e n t > 9 ) r = 1 ; e l s e r = 0 ; i f ( r ! = 0 ) throw r l : : e x c e p t i o n : : T e r m i n a l ( ” Out o f r a n g e ” ) ; } }; Following the concept requirements, the class Sim naturally implements a sensor method sense that provides an observation from the current phase of the controlled dynamical system, and a method timeStep that computes a transition consecutive to some action. Note the use of exceptions for terminal states. For the sake of simplicity in further code, the following is added. typedef typedef typedef typedef typedef Sim : : p h a s e t y p e Sim : : a c t i o n t y p e r l : : I t e r a t o r  t y p e d e f r l : : a g e n t : : o n l i n e : : E p s i l o n G r e e d y  Critic ; ArgmaxCritic ; TestAgent ; LearnAgent ; The rllib expresses that Sarsa provides a critic, offering a Q-function. As actions are discrete, the best action (i.e., argmaxa∈A Q(s, a)) can be found by considering all the actions sequentially. This is what ArgmaxCritic offers thanks to the action enumerator Aenum, in order to deﬁne greedy and ε-greedy agents. The main function then only consists in running episodes with the appropriate agents. i n t main ( i n t a r g c , char ∗ a r g v [ ] ) { Sim simulator ; Transition transition ; ArgmaxCritic c r i t i c ; LearnAgent learner ( critic ); TestAgent tester ( critic ); A a; S s; int episode , length , s t e p =0; // // // // // // // T h i s i s what t h e a g e n t c o n t r o l s .

Features of the Library Using the library requires to deﬁne the features that are speciﬁc to the problem (the simulator and the Q-function architecture in our example) from scratch, but with the help of concepts. Then, the speciﬁc features can be handled by generic code provided by the library to implement RL techniques with value function estimation. 627 F REZZA -B UET AND G EIST Currently, Q-learing, Sarsa, KTD-Q, LSTD, and policy iteration are available, as well as a multi-layer perceptron architecture. Moreover, some benchmark problems (i.e., simulators) are also provided: the mountain car, the cliff walking, the inverted pendulum and the Boyan chain. Extending the library with new algorithms is allowed, since it consists in deﬁning new templates. This is a bit more technical than only using the existing algorithms, but the structure of existing concepts helps, since it reﬂects the mathematics of RL. For example, concepts like Feature, for linear approaches mainly (i.e., Q(s, a) = θT ϕ(s, a)) and Architecture (i.e., Q(s, a) = fθ (s, a) for more general approximation) orient the design toward functional approaches of RL. The algorithms implemented so far rely on the GNU Scientiﬁc Library (see GSL, 2011) for linear algebra computation, so the GPL licence of GSL propagates to the rllib. 4. Conclusion The rllib relies only on the C++ standard and the availability of the GSL on the system. It offers state-action function approximation tools for applying RL to real problems, as well as a design that ﬁts the mathematics. The latter allows for extensions, but is also compliant with pedagogical purpose. The design of the rllib aims at allowing the user to build (using C++ programming) its own experiment, using several algorithms, several agents, on-line or batch learning, and so on. Actually, the difﬁcult part of RL is the algorithms themselves, not the script-like part of the experiment where things are put together (see the main function in our example). With a framework, in the sense of Kovacs and Egginton (2011), the experiment is not directly accessible to the user programs, since it is handled by some libraries in order to offer graphical interface or analyzing tools. The user code is then called by the framework when required. We advocate that allowing the user to call the rllib functionality at his/her convenience provides an open and extensible access to RL for students, researchers and engineers. Last, the rllib ﬁts the requirements expressed by Kovacs and Egginton (2011, Section 4.3): support of good scientiﬁc research, formulation compliant with the domain, allowing for any kind of agents and any kind of approximators, interoperability of components (the Q function of the example can be used for different algorithms and agents), maximization of run-time speed (use of C++ and templates that inline massively the code), open source, etc. Extensions of rllib can be considered, for example for handling POMDPs, and contributions of users are expected. The use of templates is unfortunately unfamiliar to many programmers, but the effort is worth it, since it brings the code at the level of the mathematical formalism, increasing readability (by a rational use of typedefs) and reducing bugs. Even if the approach is dramatically different from existing frameworks, wrappings with frameworks can be considered in further development. References Dimitri P. Bertsekas.

<p>Author: Joachim Niehren, Jérôme Champavère, Aurélien Lemay, Rémi Gilleron</p><p>Abstract: Inference algorithms for tree automata that deﬁne node selecting queries in unranked trees rely on tree pruning strategies. These impose additional assumptions on node selection that are needed to compensate for small numbers of annotated examples. Pruning-based heuristics in query learning algorithms for Web information extraction often boost the learning quality and speed up the learning process. We will distinguish the class of regular queries that are stable under a given schemaguided pruning strategy, and show that this class is learnable with polynomial time and data. Our learning algorithm is obtained by adding pruning heuristics to the traditional learning algorithm for tree automata from positive and negative examples. While justiﬁed by a formal learning model, our learning algorithm for stable queries also performs very well in practice of XML information extraction.

<p>Author: Sean Ryan Fanello, Ilaria Gori, Giorgio Metta, Francesca Odone</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity has been showed to be one of the most important properties for visual recognition purposes. In this paper we show that sparse representation plays a fundamental role in achieving one-shot learning and real-time recognition of actions. We start off from RGBD images, combine motion and appearance cues and extract state-of-the-art features in a computationally efﬁcient way. The proposed method relies on descriptors based on 3D Histograms of Scene Flow (3DHOFs) and Global Histograms of Oriented Gradient (GHOGs); adaptive sparse coding is applied to capture high-level patterns from data. We then propose a simultaneous on-line video segmentation and recognition of actions using linear SVMs. The main contribution of the paper is an effective realtime system for one-shot action modeling and recognition; the paper highlights the effectiveness of sparse coding techniques to represent 3D actions. We obtain very good results on three different data sets: a benchmark data set for one-shot action learning (the ChaLearn Gesture Data Set), an in-house data set acquired by a Kinect sensor including complex actions and gestures differing by small details, and a data set created for human-robot interaction purposes. Finally we demonstrate that our system is effective also in a human-robot interaction setting and propose a memory game, “All Gestures You Can”, to be played against a humanoid robot.

<p>Author: Jun Wan, Qiuqi Ruan, Wei Li, Shuang Deng</p><p>Abstract: For one-shot learning gesture recognition, two important challenges are: how to extract distinctive features and how to learn a discriminative model from only one training sample per gesture class. For feature extraction, a new spatio-temporal feature representation called 3D enhanced motion scale-invariant feature transform (3D EMoSIFT) is proposed, which fuses RGB-D data. Compared with other features, the new feature set is invariant to scale and rotation, and has more compact and richer visual representations. For learning a discriminative model, all features extracted from training samples are clustered with the k-means algorithm to learn a visual codebook. Then, unlike the traditional bag of feature (BoF) models using vector quantization (VQ) to map each feature into a certain visual codeword, a sparse coding method named simulation orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) is applied and thus each feature can be represented by some linear combination of a small number of codewords. Compared with VQ, SOMP leads to a much lower reconstruction error and achieves better performance. The proposed approach has been evaluated on ChaLearn gesture database and the result has been ranked amongst the top best performing techniques on ChaLearn gesture challenge (round 2).

<p>Author: Dana Angluin, James Aspnes, Sarah Eisenstat, Aryeh Kontorovich</p><p>Abstract: PAC learning of unrestricted regular languages is long known to be a difﬁcult problem. The class of shufﬂe ideals is a very restricted subclass of regular languages, where the shufﬂe ideal generated by a string u is the collection of all strings containing u as a subsequence. This fundamental language family is of theoretical interest in its own right and provides the building blocks for other important language families. Despite its apparent simplicity, the class of shufﬂe ideals appears quite difﬁcult to learn. In particular, just as for unrestricted regular languages, the class is not properly PAC learnable in polynomial time if RP = NP, and PAC learning the class improperly in polynomial time would imply polynomial time algorithms for certain fundamental problems in cryptography. In the positive direction, we give an efﬁcient algorithm for properly learning shufﬂe ideals in the statistical query (and therefore also PAC) model under the uniform distribution.

<p>Author: Samuel Gerber, Ross Whitaker</p><p>Abstract: Principal curves and manifolds provide a framework to formulate manifold learning within a statistical context. Principal curves deﬁne the notion of a curve passing through the middle of a distribution. While the intuition is clear, the formal deﬁnition leads to some technical and practical difﬁculties. In particular, principal curves are saddle points of the mean-squared projection distance, which poses severe challenges for estimation and model selection. This paper demonstrates that the difﬁculties in model selection associated with the saddle point property of principal curves are intrinsically tied to the minimization of the mean-squared projection distance. We introduce a new objective function, facilitated through a modiﬁcation of the principal curve estimation approach, for which all critical points are principal curves and minima. Thus, the new formulation removes the fundamental issue for model selection in principal curve estimation. A gradient-descent-based estimator demonstrates the effectiveness of the new formulation for controlling model complexity on numerical experiments with synthetic and real data.

<p>Author: Tony Cai, Wen-Xin Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We consider in this paper the problem of noisy 1-bit matrix completion under a general non-uniform sampling distribution using the max-norm as a convex relaxation for the rank. A max-norm constrained maximum likelihood estimate is introduced and studied. The rate of convergence for the estimate is obtained. Information-theoretical methods are used to establish a minimax lower bound under the general sampling model. The minimax upper and lower bounds together yield the optimal rate of convergence for the Frobenius norm loss. Computational algorithms and numerical performance are also discussed.

<p>Author: Yahya Forghani, Hadi Sadoghi</p><p>Abstract: This paper comments on the published work dealing with robustness and regularization of support vector machines (Journal of Machine Learning Research, Vol. 10, pp. 1485-1510, 2009) by H. Xu et al. They proposed a theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the feature space and robustness in the sample space directly. In this paper, we propose a counter example that rejects their theorem. Keywords: kernel, robustness, support vector machine 1. Comment Firstly, it must be stated that Xu et al. (2009) made a good study of robustness and regularization of support vector machines. They proposed the following theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the feature space and robustness in the sample space directly: Theorem (Xu et al., 2009) Suppose that the kernel function has the form k(x, x′ ) = f ( x − x′ ), with f : R+ → R a decreasing function. Denote by H the RKHS space of k(., .) and φ(.) the corresponding feature mapping. Then we have any x ∈ Rn , w ∈ H and c > 0, sup w, φ(x − δ) = δ ≤c δφ H≤ sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, φ(x) − δφ . The following counter example rejects the mentioned theorem. However, this theorem is a standalone result in the appendix of the paper of Xu et al. (2009), which is not used anywhere else in the paper of Xu et al. (2009). Thus, the main result and all other results of Xu et al. (2009) are not affected in any way. Counter example. Let φ(.) be the feature mapping of Gaussian kernel function. We have φ(x) H = 1. Let w = φ(x). Therefore, w, φ(x) = w H , and sup w, φ(x − δ) = w δ ≤c ∗.

(1) F ORGHANI AND S ADOGHI Moreover, δφ δφ H≤ H≤ w, φ(x) − δφ = sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, φ(x) + sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w H δφ + δφ w H H≤ + w H≤ w, δφ = sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, δφ = sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) H 2 f (0) − 2 f (c). (2) According to Equation (1) and (2), and since f is a decreasing function, for any c > 0, we have sup w, φ(x − δ) ≤ δ ≤c δφ H≤ sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, φ(x) − δφ . End of counter example. The exact spot that the error has been occurred in the mentioned theorem is Equation (19) of the paper of Xu et al. (2009). There it has been claimed that the image of the RKHS feature mapping is dense, which unfortunately is not true. Indeed, because φ(x), φ(x) = K(0) where K(.) is the kernel function, the image of the feature mapping is in a ball of radius K(0). References Huan Xu, Shie Mannor, and Constantine Caramanis.

<p>Author: Pierre Alquier, Gérard Biau</p><p>Abstract: Let (X,Y ) be a random pair taking values in R p × R. In the so-called single-index model, one has Y = f ⋆ (θ⋆T X) +W , where f ⋆ is an unknown univariate measurable function, θ⋆ is an unknown vector in Rd , and W denotes a random noise satisfying E[W |X] = 0. The single-index model is known to offer a ﬂexible way to model a variety of high-dimensional real-world phenomena. However, despite its relative simplicity, this dimension reduction scheme is faced with severe complications as soon as the underlying dimension becomes larger than the number of observations (“p larger than n” paradigm). To circumvent this difﬁculty, we consider the single-index model estimation problem from a sparsity perspective using a PAC-Bayesian approach. On the theoretical side, we offer a sharp oracle inequality, which is more powerful than the best known oracle inequalities for other common procedures of single-index recovery. The proposed method is implemented by means of the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique and its performance is compared with that of standard procedures.

<p>Author: Ery Arias-Castro, Bruno Pelletier</p><p>Abstract: Maximum Variance Unfolding is one of the main methods for (nonlinear) dimensionality reduction. We study its large sample limit, providing speciﬁc rates of convergence under standard assumptions. We ﬁnd that it is consistent when the underlying submanifold is isometric to a convex subset, and we provide some simple examples where it fails to be consistent.

<p>Author: Ran Gilad-Bachrach, Christopher J.C. Burges</p><p>Abstract: Typically, one approaches a supervised machine learning problem by writing down an objective function and ﬁnding a hypothesis that minimizes it. This is equivalent to ﬁnding the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) hypothesis for a Boltzmann distribution. However, MAP is not a robust statistic. We present an alternative approach by deﬁning a median of the distribution, which we show is both more robust, and has good generalization guarantees. We present algorithms to approximate this median. One contribution of this work is an efﬁcient method for approximating the Tukey median. The Tukey median, which is often used for data visualization and outlier detection, is a special case of the family of medians we deﬁne: however, computing it exactly is exponentially slow in the dimension. Our algorithm approximates such medians in polynomial time while making weaker assumptions than those required by previous work.

<p>Author: Tony Cai, Wen-Xin Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We consider in this paper the problem of noisy 1-bit matrix completion under a general non-uniform sampling distribution using the max-norm as a convex relaxation for the rank. A max-norm constrained maximum likelihood estimate is introduced and studied. The rate of convergence for the estimate is obtained. Information-theoretical methods are used to establish a minimax lower bound under the general sampling model. The minimax upper and lower bounds together yield the optimal rate of convergence for the Frobenius norm loss. Computational algorithms and numerical performance are also discussed.

<p>Author: Sohail Bahmani, Bhiksha Raj, Petros T. Boufounos</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity-constrained optimization has wide applicability in machine learning, statistics, and signal processing problems such as feature selection and Compressed Sensing. A vast body of work has studied the sparsity-constrained optimization from theoretical, algorithmic, and application aspects in the context of sparse estimation in linear models where the ﬁdelity of the estimate is measured by the squared error. In contrast, relatively less effort has been made in the study of sparsityconstrained optimization in cases where nonlinear models are involved or the cost function is not quadratic. In this paper we propose a greedy algorithm, Gradient Support Pursuit (GraSP), to approximate sparse minima of cost functions of arbitrary form. Should a cost function have a Stable Restricted Hessian (SRH) or a Stable Restricted Linearization (SRL), both of which are introduced in this paper, our algorithm is guaranteed to produce a sparse vector within a bounded distance from the true sparse optimum. Our approach generalizes known results for quadratic cost functions that arise in sparse linear regression and Compressed Sensing. We also evaluate the performance of GraSP through numerical simulations on synthetic and real data, where the algorithm is employed for sparse logistic regression with and without ℓ2 -regularization.

<p>Author: Jun Wang, Tony Jebara, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods play an increasingly important role in practical machine learning systems, particularly in agnostic settings when no parametric information or other prior knowledge is available about the data distribution. Given the constructed graph represented by a weight matrix, transductive inference is used to propagate known labels to predict the values of all unlabeled vertices. Designing a robust label diffusion algorithm for such graphs is a widely studied problem and various methods have recently been suggested. Many of these can be formalized as regularized function estimation through the minimization of a quadratic cost. However, most existing label diffusion methods minimize a univariate cost with the classiﬁcation function as the only variable of interest. Since the observed labels seed the diffusion process, such univariate frameworks are extremely sensitive to the initial label choice and any label noise. To alleviate the dependency on the initial observed labels, this article proposes a bivariate formulation for graph-based SSL, where both the binary label information and a continuous classiﬁcation function are arguments of the optimization. This bivariate formulation is shown to be equivalent to a linearly constrained Max-Cut problem. Finally an efﬁcient solution via greedy gradient Max-Cut (GGMC) is derived which gradually assigns unlabeled vertices to each class with minimum connectivity. Once convergence guarantees are established, this greedy Max-Cut based SSL is applied on both artiﬁcial and standard benchmark data sets where it obtains superior classiﬁcation accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art SSL methods. Moreover, GGMC shows robustness with respect to the graph construction method and maintains high accuracy over extensive experiments with various edge linking and weighting schemes.

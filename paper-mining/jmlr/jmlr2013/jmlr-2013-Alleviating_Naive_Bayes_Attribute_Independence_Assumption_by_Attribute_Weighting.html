<p>Author: Aapo Hyvärinen, Stephen M. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We present new measures of the causal direction, or direction of effect, between two non-Gaussian random variables. They are based on the likelihood ratio under the linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM). We also develop simple ﬁrst-order approximations of the likelihood ratio and analyze them based on related cumulant-based measures, which can be shown to ﬁnd the correct causal directions. We show how to apply these measures to estimate LiNGAM for more than two variables, and even in the case of more variables than observations. We further extend the method to cyclic and nonlinear models. The proposed framework is statistically at least as good as existing ones in the cases of few data points or noisy data, and it is computationally and conceptually very simple. Results on simulated fMRI data indicate that the method may be useful in neuroimaging where the number of time points is typically quite small.

<p>Author: Edward McFowland III, Skyler Speakman, Daniel B. Neill</p><p>Abstract: We propose Fast Generalized Subset Scan (FGSS), a new method for detecting anomalous patterns in general categorical data sets. We frame the pattern detection problem as a search over subsets of data records and attributes, maximizing a nonparametric scan statistic over all such subsets. We prove that the nonparametric scan statistics possess a novel property that allows for efﬁcient optimization over the exponentially many subsets of the data without an exhaustive search, enabling FGSS to scale to massive and high-dimensional data sets. We evaluate the performance of FGSS in three real-world application domains (customs monitoring, disease surveillance, and network intrusion detection), and demonstrate that FGSS can successfully detect and characterize relevant patterns in each domain. As compared to three other recently proposed detection algorithms, FGSS substantially decreased run time and improved detection power for massive multivariate data sets.

<p>Author: Reza Bosagh Zadeh, Ashish Goel</p><p>Abstract: We present a suite of algorithms for Dimension Independent Similarity Computation (DISCO) to compute all pairwise similarities between very high-dimensional sparse vectors. All of our results are provably independent of dimension, meaning that apart from the initial cost of trivially reading in the data, all subsequent operations are independent of the dimension; thus the dimension can be very large. We study Cosine, Dice, Overlap, and the Jaccard similarity measures. For Jaccard similarity we include an improved version of MinHash. Our results are geared toward the MapReduce framework. We empirically validate our theorems with large scale experiments using data from the social networking site Twitter. At time of writing, our algorithms are live in production at twitter.com.

<p>Author: Nathan Parrish, Hyrum S. Anderson, Maya R. Gupta, Dun Yu Hsiao</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of classifying a test sample given incomplete information. This problem arises naturally when data about a test sample is collected over time, or when costs must be incurred to compute the classiﬁcation features. For example, in a distributed sensor network only a fraction of the sensors may have reported measurements at a certain time, and additional time, power, and bandwidth is needed to collect the complete data to classify. A practical goal is to assign a class label as soon as enough data is available to make a good decision. We formalize this goal through the notion of reliability—the probability that a label assigned given incomplete data would be the same as the label assigned given the complete data, and we propose a method to classify incomplete data only if some reliability threshold is met. Our approach models the complete data as a random variable whose distribution is dependent on the current incomplete data and the (complete) training data. The method differs from standard imputation strategies in that our focus is on determining the reliability of the classiﬁcation decision, rather than just the class label. We show that the method provides useful reliability estimates of the correctness of the imputed class labels on a set of experiments on time-series data sets, where the goal is to classify the time-series as early as possible while still guaranteeing that the reliability threshold is met.

<p>Author: Alexander Statnikov, Nikita I. Lytkin, Jan Lemeire, Constantin F. Aliferis</p><p>Abstract: Algorithms for Markov boundary discovery from data constitute an important recent development in machine learning, primarily because they offer a principled solution to the variable/feature selection problem and give insight on local causal structure. Over the last decade many sound algorithms have been proposed to identify a single Markov boundary of the response variable. Even though faithful distributions and, more broadly, distributions that satisfy the intersection property always have a single Markov boundary, other distributions/data sets may have multiple Markov boundaries of the response variable. The latter distributions/data sets are common in practical data-analytic applications, and there are several reasons why it is important to induce multiple Markov boundaries from such data. However, there are currently no sound and efﬁcient algorithms that can accomplish this task. This paper describes a family of algorithms TIE* that can discover all Markov boundaries in a distribution. The broad applicability as well as efﬁciency of the new algorithmic family is demonstrated in an extensive benchmarking study that involved comparison with 26 state-of-the-art algorithms/variants in 15 data sets from a diversity of application domains.

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Fabio Vitale, Giovanni Zappella</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of sequentially predicting the binary labels on the nodes of an arbitrary weighted graph. We show that, under a suitable parametrization of the problem, the optimal number of prediction mistakes can be characterized (up to logarithmic factors) by the cutsize of a random spanning tree of the graph. The cutsize is induced by the unknown adversarial labeling of the graph nodes. In deriving our characterization, we obtain a simple randomized algorithm achieving in expectation the optimal mistake bound on any polynomially connected weighted graph. Our algorithm draws a random spanning tree of the original graph and then predicts the nodes of this tree in constant expected amortized time and linear space. Experiments on real-world data sets show that our method compares well to both global (Perceptron) and local (label propagation) methods, while being generally faster in practice.

<p>Author: Reza Bosagh Zadeh, Ashish Goel</p><p>Abstract: We present a suite of algorithms for Dimension Independent Similarity Computation (DISCO) to compute all pairwise similarities between very high-dimensional sparse vectors. All of our results are provably independent of dimension, meaning that apart from the initial cost of trivially reading in the data, all subsequent operations are independent of the dimension; thus the dimension can be very large. We study Cosine, Dice, Overlap, and the Jaccard similarity measures. For Jaccard similarity we include an improved version of MinHash. Our results are geared toward the MapReduce framework. We empirically validate our theorems with large scale experiments using data from the social networking site Twitter. At time of writing, our algorithms are live in production at twitter.com.

<p>Author: Indraneel Mukherjee, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: Boosting combines weak classiﬁers to form highly accurate predictors. Although the case of binary classiﬁcation is well understood, in the multiclass setting, the “correct” requirements on the weak classiﬁer, or the notion of the most efﬁcient boosting algorithms are missing. In this paper, we create a broad and general framework, within which we make precise and identify the optimal requirements on the weak-classiﬁer, as well as design the most effective, in a certain sense, boosting algorithms that assume such requirements.

</p><p>10 Introduction The aim of dimension reduction is to ﬁnd low-dimensional representations of data to facilitate data visualization, interpretation and preprocessing for further analysis. [sent-20, score-0.095]
</p><p>11 Our library, Tapkee, provides numerous efﬁcient implementations of both linear and non-linear dimension reduction algorithms, ranging from established methods to more recent developments in the ﬁeld. [sent-22, score-0.184]
</p><p>12 Implementations of modern dimensionality reduction algorithms are available in several other open-source toolboxes, such as Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. [sent-23, score-0.157]
</p><p>13 L ISITSYN , W IDMER AND I GLESIAS  Matlab Toolbox for Dimensionality Reduction by Laurens van der Maaten. [sent-29, score-0.099]
</p><p>14 In contrast to existing toolkits, our aim is to provide a generic C++ library in the spirit of the Standard Template Library to allow for greater ﬂexibility. [sent-30, score-0.215]
</p><p>15 , externally deﬁned functions may be passed to the library as arguments), which naturally enables the user to combine our library with custom distance or similarity measures, which are at the core of the most dimensionality reduction algorithms. [sent-33, score-0.883]
</p><p>16 For this, we combine advanced data structures (such as cover tree by Beygelzimer et al. [sent-35, score-0.094]
</p><p>17 , 2006), with efﬁcient libraries (as ARPACK) and carefully engineered, well-tested C++ code. [sent-36, score-0.085]
</p><p>18 Furthermore, we provide parallel implementations of many algorithms using OpenMP and preview preliminary support for GPU computing. [sent-37, score-0.089]
</p><p>19 To support the user in the choice of algorithms, we provide mathematical background for each method on the project website. [sent-40, score-0.037]
</p><p>20 To facilitate the use of Tapkee for the end-user, we distribute our library as part of the Shogun toolbox, providing access to its language bindings to such languages as Python, MATLAB, Java and a rich set of kernel and distance functions. [sent-41, score-0.336]
</p><p>21 The integration of Tapkee into C++ projects or other toolkits is therefore highly encouraged by its software design (a template library with callbacks and only few dependencies) as well as the choice of a permissive software license (BSD). [sent-43, score-0.699]
</p><p>22 Source code, documentation and various graphical and code examples can be found on the project website: http://tapkee. [sent-44, score-0.101]
</p><p>23 Implemented Algorithms Currently, our toolkit provides implementations of the following algorithms: 1. [sent-48, score-0.142]
</p><p>24 Classic distance-based methods such as Multidimensional Scaling and Isomap along with its landmark approximations such as Landmark Multidimensional Scaling and Landmark Isomap (de Silva and Tenenbaum, 2002); 3. [sent-53, score-0.064]
</p><p>25 Iterative methods such as Stochastic Proximity Embedding (Agraﬁotis, 2003), Factor Analysis, t-SNE and Barnes-Hut-SNE (van der Maaten, 2013); 5. [sent-55, score-0.065]
</p><p>26 Software Design Tapkee is a C++ pure template library with a ﬂexible, modular structure. [sent-59, score-0.324]
</p><p>27 In practice, this allows easier integration of the library code into existing projects without the need for linking. [sent-60, score-0.357]
</p><p>28 Furthermore, the library code is specialized during compilation with capabilities of compile-time optimization and customization (e. [sent-61, score-0.302]
</p><p>29 principle, our library is engineered to be callback-based (with externally deﬁned functions passed to the library as arguments). [sent-65, score-0.577]
</p><p>30 The algorithms in our library are implemented as generically as possible (formulated in terms of callback functions) with callbacks providing the interface between the user data and algorithm. [sent-66, score-0.432]
</p><p>31 For example, the user may want to embed biological sequences using a string kernel from a third party library, which—using callbacks—can be passed to Tapkee as a custom similarity measure. [sent-67, score-0.279]
</p><p>32 A major beneﬁt of our callback-centric design is the improved re-usability of our software, as user-deﬁned callback functions may contain complex custom code or operate on custom data structures without any changes to our library code. [sent-68, score-0.682]
</p><p>33 Most dimensionality reduction algorithms rely on linear algebra operations, nearest neighbor ﬁnding and the solving of eigenproblems. [sent-69, score-0.184]
</p><p>34 To address the need for high performance linear algebra we leverage the Eigen3 template library. [sent-70, score-0.105]
</p><p>35 This makes our implementations safe, easy to read and fast. [sent-71, score-0.089]
</p><p>36 Next, we approach the nearest neighbor problem with the vantage point tree and the cover tree data structures (Beygelzimer et al. [sent-72, score-0.059]
</p><p>37 Finally, to solve eigenproblems arising in most of the implemented algorithms we employ three methods: QR decomposition, Lanczos method from the ARPACK library and a randomized method described in Halko et al. [sent-74, score-0.215]
</p><p>38 The library supports all major platforms (Linux, Mac OS X and Windows). [sent-76, score-0.215]
</p><p>39 To ensure quality we combine unit-testing and continuous integration with Travis. [sent-77, score-0.09]
</p><p>40 Applications We have successfully applied Tapkee to compute low-dimensional representations of various data sets including images and biological sequences. [sent-79, score-0.033]
</p><p>41 To demonstrate an embedding of string objects, we computed a 2D embedding of English words and biological sequences (gene starts) for several organisms. [sent-81, score-0.387]
</p><p>42 See Figure 1 for examples of 2D representations computed with Tapkee and the website for more graphical examples. [sent-82, score-0.03]
</p><p>43 At the time of writing, we are aware of several successful applications of Tapkee to problems in hydrodynamics, bioinformatics and exploratory analysis of energy landscapes, from user feedback. [sent-83, score-0.037]
</p><p>44 Comparison To Related Work We have compared our implementations with their counterparts in Scikit-learn 0. [sent-85, score-0.089]
</p><p>45 For Tapkee, results for 4 threads and for a single thread (in parentheses) are shown. [sent-129, score-0.037]
</p><p>46 parison1 for implementations of two widely-used methods, which were present in all of the above libraries: Locally Linear Embedding and Isomap. [sent-130, score-0.089]
</p><p>47 For this comparison we used four data sets: a subset of MNIST (2000 vectors of size 784), swissroll with 5000 3D vectors, images from MITCBCL face recognition data set (384 vectors of size 40,000) and subsampled hyperspectral image obtained from the AVIRIS project (2520 vectors of size 224). [sent-131, score-0.077]
</p><p>48 We note that when using a single thread Tapkee outperforms the other implementations in all but one case. [sent-133, score-0.126]
</p><p>49 When using 4 cores, Tapkee is considerably faster and outperforms the other libraries in all experiments. [sent-134, score-0.085]
</p><p>50 In summary, we ﬁnd that the choice of algorithms and low-level libraries enables Tapkee to outperform other implementations under various conditions. [sent-138, score-0.174]
</p><p>51 For the code to reproduce the above experiments (and additional benchmarks) and an overview of available methods for each toolkit, please see our supplementary webpage http://iglesias. [sent-139, score-0.061]
</p><p>52 Conclusion We have implemented an efﬁcient and ﬂexible library for dimension reduction with all the methods implemented using state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures. [sent-143, score-0.31]
</p><p>53 Our library readily handles big data sets and facilitates interaction with custom code using a callback-centric API. [sent-144, score-0.431]
</p><p>54 To compare our toolkit to existing software, we provide a speed comparison on a range of data sets showing considerable speed-up. [sent-145, score-0.053]

<p>Author: Binbin Lin, Xiaofei He, Chiyuan Zhang, Ming Ji</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel local isometry based dimensionality reduction method from the perspective of vector ﬁelds, which is called parallel vector ﬁeld embedding (PFE). We ﬁrst give a discussion on local isometry and global isometry to show the intrinsic connection between parallel vector ﬁelds and isometry. The problem of ﬁnding an isometry turns out to be equivalent to ﬁnding orthonormal parallel vector ﬁelds on the data manifold. Therefore, we ﬁrst ﬁnd orthonormal parallel vector ﬁelds by solving a variational problem on the manifold. Then each embedding function can be obtained by requiring its gradient ﬁeld to be as close to the corresponding parallel vector ﬁeld as possible. Theoretical results show that our method can precisely recover the manifold if it is isometric to a connected open subset of Euclidean space. Both synthetic and real data examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method even if there is heavy noise and high curvature.

<p>Author: David Picard, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord</p><p>Abstract: JKernelMachines is a Java library for learning with kernels. It is primarily designed to deal with custom kernels that are not easily found in standard libraries, such as kernels on structured data. These types of kernels are often used in computer vision or bioinformatics applications. We provide several kernels leading to state of the art classiﬁcation performances in computer vision, as well as various kernels on sets. The main focus of the library is to be easily extended with new kernels. Standard SVM optimization algorithms are available, but also more sophisticated learning-based kernel combination methods such as Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL), and a recently published algorithm to learn powered products of similarities (Product Kernel Learning).

<p>Author: Ameet Talwalkar, Sanjiv Kumar, Mehryar Mohri, Henry Rowley</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the efﬁcacy of sampling-based low-rank approximation techniques when applied to large dense kernel matrices. We analyze two common approximate singular value decomposition techniques, namely the Nystr¨ m and Column sampling methods. We present a theoretical o comparison between these two methods, provide novel insights regarding their suitability for various tasks and present experimental results that support our theory. Our results illustrate the relative strengths of each method. We next examine the performance of these two techniques on the largescale task of extracting low-dimensional manifold structure given millions of high-dimensional face images. We address the computational challenges of non-linear dimensionality reduction via Isomap and Laplacian Eigenmaps, using a graph containing about 18 million nodes and 65 million edges. We present extensive experiments on learning low-dimensional embeddings for two large face data sets: CMU-PIE (35 thousand faces) and a web data set (18 million faces). Our comparisons show that the Nystr¨ m approximation is superior to the Column sampling method for this o task. Furthermore, approximate Isomap tends to perform better than Laplacian Eigenmaps on both clustering and classiﬁcation with the labeled CMU-PIE data set.

<p>Author: Sergey Lisitsyn, Christian Widmer, Fernando J. Iglesias Garcia</p><p>Abstract: We present Tapkee, a C++ template library that provides efﬁcient implementations of more than 20 widely used dimensionality reduction techniques ranging from Locally Linear Embedding (Roweis and Saul, 2000) and Isomap (de Silva and Tenenbaum, 2002) to the recently introduced BarnesHut-SNE (van der Maaten, 2013). Our library was designed with a focus on performance and ﬂexibility. For performance, we combine efﬁcient multi-core algorithms, modern data structures and state-of-the-art low-level libraries. To achieve ﬂexibility, we designed a clean interface for applying methods to user data and provide a callback API that facilitates integration with the library. The library is freely available as open-source software and is distributed under the permissive BSD 3-clause license. We encourage the integration of Tapkee into other open-source toolboxes and libraries. For example, Tapkee has been integrated into the codebase of the Shogun toolbox (Sonnenburg et al., 2010), giving us access to a rich set of kernels, distance measures and bindings to common programming languages including Python, Octave, Matlab, R, Java, C#, Ruby, Perl and Lua. Source code, examples and documentation are available at http://tapkee.lisitsyn.me.

<p>Author: Ryan R. Curtin, James R. Cline, N. P. Slagle, William B. March, Parikshit Ram, Nishant A. Mehta, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: MLPACK is a state-of-the-art, scalable, multi-platform C++ machine learning library released in late 2011 offering both a simple, consistent API accessible to novice users and high performance and ﬂexibility to expert users by leveraging modern features of C++. MLPACK provides cutting-edge algorithms whose benchmarks exhibit far better performance than other leading machine learning libraries. MLPACK version 1.0.3, licensed under the LGPL, is available at http://www.mlpack.org. Keywords: C++, dual-tree algorithms, machine learning software, open source software, largescale learning 1. Introduction and Goals Though several machine learning libraries are freely available online, few, if any, offer efﬁcient algorithms to the average user. For instance, the popular Weka toolkit (Hall et al., 2009) emphasizes ease of use but scales poorly; the distributed Apache Mahout library offers scalability at a cost of higher overhead (such as clusters and powerful servers often unavailable to the average user). Also, few libraries offer breadth; for instance, libsvm (Chang and Lin, 2011) and the Tilburg MemoryBased Learner (TiMBL) are highly scalable and accessible yet each offer only a single method. MLPACK, intended to be the machine learning analog to the general-purpose LAPACK linear algebra library, aims to combine efﬁciency and accessibility. Written in C++, MLPACK uses the highly efﬁcient Armadillo matrix library (Sanderson, 2010) and is freely available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Through the use of C++ templates, MLPACK both eliminates unnecessary copying of data sets and performs expression optimizations unavailable in other languages. Also, MLPACK is, to our knowledge, unique among existing libraries in using generic programming features of C++ to allow customization of the available machine learning methods without incurring performance penalties. c 2013 Ryan R. Curtin, James R. Cline, N. P. Slagle, William B. March, Parikshit Ram, Nishant A. Mehta and Alexander G. Gray. C URTIN , C LINE , S LAGLE , M ARCH , R AM , M EHTA AND G RAY In addition, users ranging from students to experts should ﬁnd the consistent, intuitive interface of MLPACK to be highly accessible. Finally, the source code provides references and comprehensive documentation. Four major goals of the development team of MLPACK are • • • • to implement scalable, fast machine learning algorithms, to design an intuitive, consistent, and simple API for non-expert users, to implement a variety of machine learning methods, and to provide cutting-edge machine learning algorithms unavailable elsewhere. This paper offers both an introduction to the simple and extensible API and a glimpse of the superior performance of the library. 2. Package Overview Each algorithm available in MLPACK features both a set of C++ library functions and a standalone command-line executable. Version 1.0.3 includes the following methods: • • • • • • • • • • • • • • nearest/furthest neighbor search with cover trees or kd-trees (k-nearest-neighbors) range search with cover trees or kd-trees Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) hidden Markov models (HMMs) LARS / Lasso regression k-means clustering fast hierarchical clustering (Euclidean MST calculation)1 (March et al., 2010) kernel PCA (and regular PCA) local coordinate coding1 (Yu et al., 2009) sparse coding using dictionary learning RADICAL (Robust, Accurate, Direct ICA aLgorithm) (Learned-Miller and Fisher, 2003) maximum variance unfolding (MVU) via LRSDP1 (Burer and Monteiro, 2003) the naive Bayes classiﬁer density estimation trees1 (Ram and Gray, 2011) The development team manages MLPACK with Subversion and the Trac bug reporting system, allowing easy downloads and simple bug reporting. The entire development process is transparent, so any interested user can easily contribute to the library. MLPACK can compile from source on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows; currently, different Linux distributions are reviewing MLPACK for inclusion in their package managers, which will allow users to install MLPACK without needing to compile from source. 3. A Consistent, Simple API MLPACK features a highly accessible API, both in style (such as consistent naming schemes and coding conventions) and ease of use (such as templated defaults), as well as stringent documentation standards. Consequently, a new user can execute algorithms out-of-the-box often with little or no adjustment to parameters, while the seasoned expert can expect extreme ﬂexibility in algorithmic 1.

It is primarily designed to deal with custom kernels that are not easily found in standard libraries, such as kernels on structured data.

We provide several kernels leading to state of the art classiﬁcation performances in computer vision, as well as various kernels on sets. The main focus of the library is to be easily extended with new kernels.

<p>Author: Hervé Frezza-Buet, Matthieu Geist</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces the rllib as an original C++ template-based library oriented toward value function estimation. Generic programming is promoted here as a way of having a good ﬁt between the mathematics of reinforcement learning and their implementation in a library. The main concepts of rllib are presented, as well as a short example. Keywords: reinforcement learning, C++, generic programming 1. C++ Genericity for Fitting the Mathematics of Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning (RL) is a ﬁeld of machine learning that beneﬁts from a rigorous mathematical formalism, as shown for example by Bertsekas (1995). Although this formalism is well accepted in the ﬁeld, its translation into efﬁcient computer science tools has surprisingly not led to any standard yet, as mentioned by Kovacs and Egginton (2011). The claim of this paper is that genericity enables a natural expression of the mathematics of RL. The rllib (2011) library implements this idea in the C++ language, where genericity relies on templates. Templates automate the re-writing of some generic code involving user types, offering a strong type checking at compile time that improves the code safety. Using the rllib templates requires that the user-deﬁned types ﬁt some documented concepts. For example, some class C deﬁning an agent should be designed so that C::state type is the type used for the states, C::action type is the type used for the actions, and the method C::action type policy(const C::state type& s) const is implemented, in order to compute the action to be performed in a given state. This concept deﬁnition speciﬁes what is required for an agent mathematically. Note that C does not need to inherit from any kind of abstract rl::Agent class to be used by the rllib tools. It can be directly provided as a type argument to any rllib template requiring an argument ﬁtting the concept of an agent, so that the re-written code actually compiles. 2. A Short Example Let us consider the following toy-example. The state space contains values from 0 to 9, and actions consist in increasing or decreasing the value. When the value gets out of bounds, a reward is returned ∗. Also at UMI 2958 Georgia Tech / CNRS, 2-3, rue Marconi, 57070 Metz, France. c 2013 Herv´ Frezza-Buet and Matthieu Geist. e F REZZA -B UET AND G EIST (-1 for bound 0, 1 for bound 9). Otherwise, a null reward is returned. Let us deﬁne this problem and run Sarsa. First, a simulator class ﬁtting the concept Simulator described in the documentation is needed. c l a s s Sim { / / Our s i m u l a t o r c l a s s . No i n h e r i t a n c e r e q u i r e d . private : i n t c u r r e n t ; double r ; public : typedef int phase type ; typedef int observation type ; t y p e d e f enum { up , down} a c t i o n t y p e ; t y p e d e f d o u b l e r e w a r d t y p e ; Sim ( v o i d ) : c u r r e n t ( 0 ) , r ( 0 ) {} v o i d s e t P h a s e ( c o n s t p h a s e t y p e &s; ) { c u r r e n t = s %10;} c o n s t o b s e r v a t i o n t y p e& s e n s e ( v o i d ) c o n s t { r e t u r n c u r r e n t ; } reward type reward ( void ) const { return r ;} v o i d t i m e S t e p ( c o n s t a c t i o n t y p e &a; ) { i f ( a == up ) c u r r e n t ++; e l s e c u r r e n t −−; i f ( c u r r e n t < 0 ) r =−1; e l s e i f ( c u r r e n t > 9 ) r = 1 ; e l s e r = 0 ; i f ( r ! = 0 ) throw r l : : e x c e p t i o n : : T e r m i n a l ( ” Out o f r a n g e ” ) ; } }; Following the concept requirements, the class Sim naturally implements a sensor method sense that provides an observation from the current phase of the controlled dynamical system, and a method timeStep that computes a transition consecutive to some action. Note the use of exceptions for terminal states. For the sake of simplicity in further code, the following is added. typedef typedef typedef typedef typedef Sim : : p h a s e t y p e Sim : : a c t i o n t y p e r l : : I t e r a t o r  t y p e d e f r l : : a g e n t : : o n l i n e : : E p s i l o n G r e e d y  Critic ; ArgmaxCritic ; TestAgent ; LearnAgent ; The rllib expresses that Sarsa provides a critic, offering a Q-function. As actions are discrete, the best action (i.e., argmaxa∈A Q(s, a)) can be found by considering all the actions sequentially. This is what ArgmaxCritic offers thanks to the action enumerator Aenum, in order to deﬁne greedy and ε-greedy agents. The main function then only consists in running episodes with the appropriate agents. i n t main ( i n t a r g c , char ∗ a r g v [ ] ) { Sim simulator ; Transition transition ; ArgmaxCritic c r i t i c ; LearnAgent learner ( critic ); TestAgent tester ( critic ); A a; S s; int episode , length , s t e p =0; // // // // // // // T h i s i s what t h e a g e n t c o n t r o l s .

Features of the Library Using the library requires to deﬁne the features that are speciﬁc to the problem (the simulator and the Q-function architecture in our example) from scratch, but with the help of concepts. Then, the speciﬁc features can be handled by generic code provided by the library to implement RL techniques with value function estimation. 627 F REZZA -B UET AND G EIST Currently, Q-learing, Sarsa, KTD-Q, LSTD, and policy iteration are available, as well as a multi-layer perceptron architecture. Moreover, some benchmark problems (i.e., simulators) are also provided: the mountain car, the cliff walking, the inverted pendulum and the Boyan chain. Extending the library with new algorithms is allowed, since it consists in deﬁning new templates. This is a bit more technical than only using the existing algorithms, but the structure of existing concepts helps, since it reﬂects the mathematics of RL. For example, concepts like Feature, for linear approaches mainly (i.e., Q(s, a) = θT ϕ(s, a)) and Architecture (i.e., Q(s, a) = fθ (s, a) for more general approximation) orient the design toward functional approaches of RL. The algorithms implemented so far rely on the GNU Scientiﬁc Library (see GSL, 2011) for linear algebra computation, so the GPL licence of GSL propagates to the rllib. 4. Conclusion The rllib relies only on the C++ standard and the availability of the GSL on the system. It offers state-action function approximation tools for applying RL to real problems, as well as a design that ﬁts the mathematics. The latter allows for extensions, but is also compliant with pedagogical purpose. The design of the rllib aims at allowing the user to build (using C++ programming) its own experiment, using several algorithms, several agents, on-line or batch learning, and so on. Actually, the difﬁcult part of RL is the algorithms themselves, not the script-like part of the experiment where things are put together (see the main function in our example). With a framework, in the sense of Kovacs and Egginton (2011), the experiment is not directly accessible to the user programs, since it is handled by some libraries in order to offer graphical interface or analyzing tools. The user code is then called by the framework when required. We advocate that allowing the user to call the rllib functionality at his/her convenience provides an open and extensible access to RL for students, researchers and engineers. Last, the rllib ﬁts the requirements expressed by Kovacs and Egginton (2011, Section 4.3): support of good scientiﬁc research, formulation compliant with the domain, allowing for any kind of agents and any kind of approximators, interoperability of components (the Q function of the example can be used for different algorithms and agents), maximization of run-time speed (use of C++ and templates that inline massively the code), open source, etc. Extensions of rllib can be considered, for example for handling POMDPs, and contributions of users are expected. The use of templates is unfortunately unfamiliar to many programmers, but the effort is worth it, since it brings the code at the level of the mathematical formalism, increasing readability (by a rational use of typedefs) and reducing bugs. Even if the approach is dramatically different from existing frameworks, wrappings with frameworks can be considered in further development. References Dimitri P. Bertsekas.

<p>Author: Sergey Lisitsyn, Christian Widmer, Fernando J. Iglesias Garcia</p><p>Abstract: We present Tapkee, a C++ template library that provides efﬁcient implementations of more than 20 widely used dimensionality reduction techniques ranging from Locally Linear Embedding (Roweis and Saul, 2000) and Isomap (de Silva and Tenenbaum, 2002) to the recently introduced BarnesHut-SNE (van der Maaten, 2013). Our library was designed with a focus on performance and ﬂexibility. For performance, we combine efﬁcient multi-core algorithms, modern data structures and state-of-the-art low-level libraries. To achieve ﬂexibility, we designed a clean interface for applying methods to user data and provide a callback API that facilitates integration with the library. The library is freely available as open-source software and is distributed under the permissive BSD 3-clause license. We encourage the integration of Tapkee into other open-source toolboxes and libraries. For example, Tapkee has been integrated into the codebase of the Shogun toolbox (Sonnenburg et al., 2010), giving us access to a rich set of kernels, distance measures and bindings to common programming languages including Python, Octave, Matlab, R, Java, C#, Ruby, Perl and Lua.

<p>Author: Xiao-Tong Yuan, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the sparse eigenvalue problem, which is to extract dominant (largest) sparse eigenvectors with at most k non-zero components. We propose a simple yet effective solution called truncated power method that can approximately solve the underlying nonconvex optimization problem. A strong sparse recovery result is proved for the truncated power method, and this theory is our key motivation for developing the new algorithm. The proposed method is tested on applications such as sparse principal component analysis and the densest k-subgraph problem. Extensive experiments on several synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the competitive empirical performance of our method.

<p>Author: Andrea Tacchetti, Pavan K. Mallapragada, Matteo Santoro, Lorenzo Rosasco</p><p>Abstract: We present GURLS, a least squares, modular, easy-to-extend software library for efﬁcient supervised learning. GURLS is targeted to machine learning practitioners, as well as non-specialists. It offers a number state-of-the-art training strategies for medium and large-scale learning, and routines for efﬁcient model selection. The library is particularly well suited for multi-output problems (multi-category/multi-label). GURLS is currently available in two independent implementations: Matlab and C++. It takes advantage of the favorable properties of regularized least squares algorithm to exploit advanced tools in linear algebra. Routines to handle computations with very large matrices by means of memory-mapped storage and distributed task execution are available. The package is distributed under the BSD license and is available for download at https://github.com/LCSL/GURLS. Keywords: regularized least squares, big data, linear algebra 1. Introduction and Design Supervised learning has become a fundamental tool for the design of intelligent systems and the analysis of high dimensional data. Key to this success has been the availability of efﬁcient, easy-touse software packages. New data collection technologies make it easy to gather high dimensional, multi-output data sets of increasing size. This trend calls for new software solutions for the automatic training, tuning and testing of supervised learning methods. These observations motivated the design of GURLS (Grand Uniﬁed Regularized Least Squares). The package was developed to pursue the following goals: Speed: Fast training/testing procedures for learning problems with potentially large/huge number of points, features and especially outputs (e.g., classes). Memory: Flexible data management to work with large data sets by means of memory-mapped storage. Performance: ∗.

Mallapragada, Matteo Santoro and Lorenzo Rosasco. TACCHETTI , M ALLAPRAGADA , S ANTORO AND ROSASCO State of the art results in high-dimensional multi-output problems. Usability and modularity: Easy to use and to expand. GURLS is based on Regularized Least Squares (RLS) and takes advantage of all the favorable properties of these methods (Rifkin et al., 2003). Since the algorithm reduces to solving a linear system, GURLS is set up to exploit the powerful tools, and recent advances, of linear algebra (including randomized solver, ﬁrst order methods, etc.). Second, it makes use of RLS properties which are particularly suited for high dimensional learning. For example: (1) RLS has natural primal and dual formulation (hence having complexity which is the smallest between number of examples and features); (2) efﬁcient parameter selection (closed form expression of the leave one out error and efﬁcient computations of regularization path); (3) natural and efﬁcient extension to multiple outputs. Speciﬁc attention has been devoted to handle large high dimensional data sets. We rely on data structures that can be serialized using memory-mapped ﬁles, and on a distributed task manager to perform a number of key steps (such as matrix multiplication) without loading the whole data set in memory. Efforts were devoted to to provide a lean API and an exhaustive documentation. GURLS has been deployed and tested successfully on Linux, MacOS and Windows. The library is distributed under the simpliﬁed BSD license, and can be downloaded from https://github.com/LCSL/GURLS. 2. Description of the Library The library comprises four main modules. GURLS and bGURLS—both implemented in Matlab— are aimed at solving learning problems with small/medium and large-scale data sets respectively. GURLS++ and bGURLS++ are their C++ counterparts. The Matlab and C++ versions share the same design, but the C++ modules have signiﬁcant improvements, which make them faster and more ﬂexible. The speciﬁcation of the desired machine learning experiment in the library is straightforward. Basically, it is a formal description of a pipeline, that is, an ordered sequence of steps. Each step identiﬁes an actual learning task, and belongs to a predeﬁned category. The core of the library is a method (a class in the C++ implementation) called GURLScore, which is responsible for processing the sequence of tasks in the proper order and for linking the output of the former task to the input of the subsequent one. A key role is played by the additional “options” structure, referred to as OPT. OPT is used to store all conﬁguration parameters required to customize the behavior of individual tasks in the pipeline. Tasks receive conﬁguration parameters from OPT in read-only mode and—upon termination—the results are appended to the structure by GURLScore in order to make them available to subsequent tasks. This allows the user to skip the execution of some tasks in a pipeline, by simply inserting the desired results directly into the options structure. Currently, we identify six different task categories: data set splitting, kernel computation, model selection, training, evaluation and testing and performance assessment and analysis. Tasks belonging to the same category may be interchanged with each other. 2.1 Learning From Large Data Sets Two modules in GURLS have been speciﬁcally designed to deal with big data scenarios. The approach we adopted is mainly based on a memory-mapped abstraction of matrix and vector data structures, and on a distributed computation of a number of standard problems in linear algebra. For learning on big data, we decided to focus speciﬁcally on those situations where one seeks a linear model on a large set of (possibly non linear) features. A more accurate speciﬁcation of what “large” means in GURLS is related to the number of features d and the number of training 3202 GURLS: A L EAST S QUARES L IBRARY FOR S UPERVISED L EARNING data set optdigit landast pendigit letter isolet # of samples 3800 4400 7400 10000 6200 # of classes 10 6 10 26 26 # of variables 64 36 16 16 600 Table 1: Data sets description. examples n: we require it must be possible to store a min(d, n) × min(d, n) matrix in memory. In practice, this roughly means we can train models with up-to 25k features on machines with 8Gb of RAM, and up-to 50k features on machines with 36Gb of RAM. We do not require the data matrix itself to be stored in memory: within GURLS it is possible to manage an arbitrarily large set of training examples. We distinguish two different scenarios. Data sets that can fully reside in RAM without any memory mapping techniques—such as swapping—are considered to be small/medium. Larger data sets are considered to be “big” and learning must be performed using either bGURLS or bGURLS++ . These two modules include all the design patterns described above, and have been complemented with additional big data and distributed computation capabilities. Big data support is obtained using a data structure called bigarray, which allows to handle data matrices as large as the space available on the hard drive: we store the entire data set on disk and load only small chunks in memory when required. There are some differences between the Matlab and C++ implementations. bGURLS relies on a simple, ad hoc interface, called GURLS Distributed Manager (GDM), to distribute matrix-matrix multiplications, thus allowing users to perform the important task of kernel matrix computation on a distributed network of computing nodes. After this step, the subsequent tasks behave as in GURLS. bGURLS++ (currently in active development) offers more interesting features because it is based on the MPI libraries. Therefore, it allows for a full distribution within every single task of the pipeline. All the processes read the input data from a shared ﬁlesystem over the network and then start executing the same pipeline. During execution, each process’ task communicates with the corresponding ones. Every process maintains its local copy of the options. Once the same task is completed by all processes, the local copies of the options are synchronized. This architecture allows for the creation of hybrid pipelines comprising serial one-process-based tasks from GURLS++ . 3. Experiments We decided to focus the experimental analysis in the paper to the assessment of GURLS’ performance both in terms of accuracy and time. In our experiments we considered 5 popular data sets, brieﬂy described in Table 1. Experiments were run on a Intel Xeon 5140 @ 2.33GHz processor with 8GB of RAM, and running Ubuntu 8.10 Server (64 bit). optdigit accuracy (%) GURLS (linear primal) GURLS (linear dual) LS-SVM linear GURLS (500 random features) GURLS (1000 random features) GURLS (Gaussian kernel) LS-SVM (Gaussian kernel) time (s) landsat accuracy (%) time (s) pendigit accuracy (%) time (s) 92.3 92.3 92.3 96.8 97.5 98.3 98.3 0.49 726 7190 25.6 207 13500 26100 63.68 66.3 64.6 63.5 63.5 90.4 90.51 0.22 1148 6526 28.0 187 20796 18430 82.24 82.46 82.3 96.7 95.8 98.4 98.36 0.23 5590 46240 31.6 199 100600 120170 Table 2: Comparison between GURLS and LS-SVM. 3203 TACCHETTI , M ALLAPRAGADA , S ANTORO AND ROSASCO Performance (%) 1 0.95 0.9 0.85 isolet(∇) letter(×) 0.8 pendigit(∆) 0.75 landsat(♦) optdigit(◦) 0.7 LIBSVM:rbf 0.65 GURLS++:rbf GURLS:randomfeatures-1000 0.6 GURLS:randomfeatures-500 0.55 0.5 0 10 GURLS:rbf 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 Time (s) 10 Figure 1: Prediction accuracy vs. computing time. The color represents the training method and the library used. In blue: the Matlab implementation of RLS with RBF kernel, in red: its C++ counterpart. In dark red: results of LIBSVM with RBF kernel. In yellow and green: results obtained using a linear kernel on 500 and 1000 random features respectively. We set up different pipelines and compared the performance to SVM, for which we used the python modular interface to LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011). Automatic selection of the optimal regularization parameter is implemented identically in all experiments: (i) split the data; (ii) deﬁne a set of regularization parameter on a regular grid; (iii) perform hold-out validation. The variance of the Gaussian kernel has been ﬁxed by looking at the statistics of the pairwise distances among training examples. The prediction accuracy of GURLS and GURLS++ is identical—as expected—but the implementation in C++ is signiﬁcantly faster. The prediction accuracy of standard RLS-based methods is in many cases higher than SVM. Exploiting the primal formulation of RLS, we further ran experiments with the random features approximation (Rahimi and Recht, 2008). As show in Figure 1, the performance of this method is comparable to that of SVM at a much lower computational cost in the majority of the tested data sets. We further compared GURLS with another available least squares based toolbox: the LS-SVM toolbox (Suykens et al., 2001), which includes routines for parameter selection such as coupled simulated annealing and line/grid search. The goal of this experiment is to benchmark the performance of the parameter selection with random data splitting included in GURLS. For a fair comparison, we considered only the Matlab implementation of GURLS. Results are reported in Table 2. As expected, using the linear kernel with the primal formulation—not available in LS-SVM—is the fastest approach since it leverages the lower dimensionality of the input space. When the Gaussian kernel is used, GURLS and LS-SVM have comparable computing time and classiﬁcation performance. Note, however, that in GURLS the number of parameter in the grid search is ﬁxed to 400, while in LS-SVM it may vary and is limited to 70. The interesting results obtained with the random features implementation in GURLS, make it an interesting choice in many applications. Finally, all GURLS pipelines, in their Matlab implementation, are faster than LS-SVM and further improvements can be achieved with GURLS++ .

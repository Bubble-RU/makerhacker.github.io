<p>Author: Nakul Verma</p><p>Abstract: Low dimensional embeddings of manifold data have gained popularity in the last decade. However, a systematic ﬁnite sample analysis of manifold embedding algorithms largely eludes researchers. Here we present two algorithms that embed a general n-dimensional manifold into Rd (where d only depends on some key manifold properties such as its intrinsic dimension, volume and curvature) that guarantee to approximately preserve all interpoint geodesic distances.

<p>Author: Binbin Lin, Xiaofei He, Chiyuan Zhang, Ming Ji</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel local isometry based dimensionality reduction method from the perspective of vector ﬁelds, which is called parallel vector ﬁeld embedding (PFE). We ﬁrst give a discussion on local isometry and global isometry to show the intrinsic connection between parallel vector ﬁelds and isometry. The problem of ﬁnding an isometry turns out to be equivalent to ﬁnding orthonormal parallel vector ﬁelds on the data manifold. Therefore, we ﬁrst ﬁnd orthonormal parallel vector ﬁelds by solving a variational problem on the manifold. Then each embedding function can be obtained by requiring its gradient ﬁeld to be as close to the corresponding parallel vector ﬁeld as possible. Theoretical results show that our method can precisely recover the manifold if it is isometric to a connected open subset of Euclidean space. Both synthetic and real data examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method even if there is heavy noise and high curvature.

<p>Author: Samuel Gerber, Ross Whitaker</p><p>Abstract: Principal curves and manifolds provide a framework to formulate manifold learning within a statistical context. Principal curves deﬁne the notion of a curve passing through the middle of a distribution. While the intuition is clear, the formal deﬁnition leads to some technical and practical difﬁculties. In particular, principal curves are saddle points of the mean-squared projection distance, which poses severe challenges for estimation and model selection. This paper demonstrates that the difﬁculties in model selection associated with the saddle point property of principal curves are intrinsically tied to the minimization of the mean-squared projection distance. We introduce a new objective function, facilitated through a modiﬁcation of the principal curve estimation approach, for which all critical points are principal curves and minima. Thus, the new formulation removes the fundamental issue for model selection in principal curve estimation. A gradient-descent-based estimator demonstrates the effectiveness of the new formulation for controlling model complexity on numerical experiments with synthetic and real data.

<p>Author: Ameet Talwalkar, Sanjiv Kumar, Mehryar Mohri, Henry Rowley</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the efﬁcacy of sampling-based low-rank approximation techniques when applied to large dense kernel matrices. We analyze two common approximate singular value decomposition techniques, namely the Nystr¨ m and Column sampling methods. We present a theoretical o comparison between these two methods, provide novel insights regarding their suitability for various tasks and present experimental results that support our theory. Our results illustrate the relative strengths of each method. We next examine the performance of these two techniques on the largescale task of extracting low-dimensional manifold structure given millions of high-dimensional face images. We address the computational challenges of non-linear dimensionality reduction via Isomap and Laplacian Eigenmaps, using a graph containing about 18 million nodes and 65 million edges. We present extensive experiments on learning low-dimensional embeddings for two large face data sets: CMU-PIE (35 thousand faces) and a web data set (18 million faces). Our comparisons show that the Nystr¨ m approximation is superior to the Column sampling method for this o task. Furthermore, approximate Isomap tends to perform better than Laplacian Eigenmaps on both clustering and classiﬁcation with the labeled CMU-PIE data set.

<p>Author: Cynthia Rudin, Benjamin Letham, David Madigan</p><p>Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis for prediction algorithms based on association rules. As part of this analysis, we introduce a problem for which rules are particularly natural, called “sequential event prediction.” In sequential event prediction, events in a sequence are revealed one by one, and the goal is to determine which event will next be revealed. The training set is a collection of past sequences of events. An example application is to predict which item will next be placed into a customer’s online shopping cart, given his/her past purchases. In the context of this problem, algorithms based on association rules have distinct advantages over classical statistical and machine learning methods: they look at correlations based on subsets of co-occurring past events (items a and b imply item c), they can be applied to the sequential event prediction problem in a natural way, they can potentially handle the “cold start” problem where the training set is small, and they yield interpretable predictions. In this work, we present two algorithms that incorporate association rules. These algorithms can be used both for sequential event prediction and for supervised classiﬁcation, and they are simple enough that they can possibly be understood by users, customers, patients, managers, etc. We provide generalization guarantees on these algorithms based on algorithmic stability analysis from statistical learning theory. We include a discussion of the strict minimum support threshold often used in association rule mining, and introduce an “adjusted conﬁdence” measure that provides a weaker minimum support condition that has advantages over the strict minimum support. The paper brings together ideas from statistical learning theory, association rule mining and Bayesian analysis.

Kwok, Zhi-Hua Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning from weakly labeled data, where labels of the training examples are incomplete. This includes, for example, (i) semi-supervised learning where labels are partially known; (ii) multi-instance learning where labels are implicitly known; and (iii) clustering where labels are completely unknown. Unlike supervised learning, learning with weak labels involves a difﬁcult Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Therefore, it can suffer from poor scalability and may also get stuck in local minimum. In this paper, we focus on SVMs and propose the W ELL SVM via a novel label generation strategy. This leads to a convex relaxation of the original MIP, which is at least as tight as existing convex Semi-Deﬁnite Programming (SDP) relaxations. Moreover, the W ELL SVM can be solved via a sequence of SVM subproblems that are much more scalable than previous convex SDP relaxations. Experiments on three weakly labeled learning tasks, namely, (i) semi-supervised learning; (ii) multi-instance learning for locating regions of interest in content-based information retrieval; and (iii) clustering, clearly demonstrate improved performance, and W ELL SVM is also readily applicable on large data sets.

<p>Author: Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: Manifold regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) is a geometrically motivated framework for machine learning within which several semi-supervised algorithms have been constructed. Here we try to provide some theoretical understanding of this approach. Our main result is to expose the natural structure of a class of problems on which manifold regularization methods are helpful. We show that for such problems, no supervised learner can learn effectively. On the other hand, a manifold based learner (that knows the manifold or “learns” it from unlabeled examples) can learn with relatively few labeled examples. Our analysis follows a minimax style with an emphasis on ﬁnite sample results (in terms of n: the number of labeled examples). These results allow us to properly interpret manifold regularization and related spectral and geometric algorithms in terms of their potential use in semi-supervised learning.

<p>Author: Jun Wang, Tony Jebara, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods play an increasingly important role in practical machine learning systems, particularly in agnostic settings when no parametric information or other prior knowledge is available about the data distribution. Given the constructed graph represented by a weight matrix, transductive inference is used to propagate known labels to predict the values of all unlabeled vertices. Designing a robust label diffusion algorithm for such graphs is a widely studied problem and various methods have recently been suggested. Many of these can be formalized as regularized function estimation through the minimization of a quadratic cost. However, most existing label diffusion methods minimize a univariate cost with the classiﬁcation function as the only variable of interest. Since the observed labels seed the diffusion process, such univariate frameworks are extremely sensitive to the initial label choice and any label noise. To alleviate the dependency on the initial observed labels, this article proposes a bivariate formulation for graph-based SSL, where both the binary label information and a continuous classiﬁcation function are arguments of the optimization. This bivariate formulation is shown to be equivalent to a linearly constrained Max-Cut problem. Finally an efﬁcient solution via greedy gradient Max-Cut (GGMC) is derived which gradually assigns unlabeled vertices to each class with minimum connectivity. Once convergence guarantees are established, this greedy Max-Cut based SSL is applied on both artiﬁcial and standard benchmark data sets where it obtains superior classiﬁcation accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art SSL methods. Moreover, GGMC shows robustness with respect to the graph construction method and maintains high accuracy over extensive experiments with various edge linking and weighting schemes.

<p>Author: Robert Hable</p><p>Abstract: In supervised learning problems, global and local learning algorithms are used. In contrast to global learning algorithms, the prediction of a local learning algorithm in a testing point is only based on training data which are close to the testing point. Every global algorithm such as support vector machines (SVM) can be localized in the following way: in every testing point, the (global) learning algorithm is not applied to the whole training data but only to the k nearest neighbors (kNN) of the testing point. In case of support vector machines, the success of such mixtures of SVM and kNN (called SVM-KNN) has been shown in extensive simulation studies and also for real data sets but only little has been known on theoretical properties so far. In the present article, it is shown how a large class of regularized kernel methods (including SVM) can be localized in order to get a universally consistent learning algorithm.

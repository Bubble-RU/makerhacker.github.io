<p>Author: Binbin Lin, Xiaofei He, Chiyuan Zhang, Ming Ji</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel local isometry based dimensionality reduction method from the perspective of vector ﬁelds, which is called parallel vector ﬁeld embedding (PFE). We ﬁrst give a discussion on local isometry and global isometry to show the intrinsic connection between parallel vector ﬁelds and isometry. The problem of ﬁnding an isometry turns out to be equivalent to ﬁnding orthonormal parallel vector ﬁelds on the data manifold. Therefore, we ﬁrst ﬁnd orthonormal parallel vector ﬁelds by solving a variational problem on the manifold. Then each embedding function can be obtained by requiring its gradient ﬁeld to be as close to the corresponding parallel vector ﬁeld as possible. Theoretical results show that our method can precisely recover the manifold if it is isometric to a connected open subset of Euclidean space. Both synthetic and real data examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method even if there is heavy noise and high curvature.

<p>Author: Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: Manifold regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) is a geometrically motivated framework for machine learning within which several semi-supervised algorithms have been constructed. Here we try to provide some theoretical understanding of this approach. Our main result is to expose the natural structure of a class of problems on which manifold regularization methods are helpful. We show that for such problems, no supervised learner can learn effectively. On the other hand, a manifold based learner (that knows the manifold or “learns” it from unlabeled examples) can learn with relatively few labeled examples. Our analysis follows a minimax style with an emphasis on ﬁnite sample results (in terms of n: the number of labeled examples). These results allow us to properly interpret manifold regularization and related spectral and geometric algorithms in terms of their potential use in semi-supervised learning.

<p>Author: Pierre Alquier, Gérard Biau</p><p>Abstract: Let (X,Y ) be a random pair taking values in R p × R. In the so-called single-index model, one has Y = f ⋆ (θ⋆T X) +W , where f ⋆ is an unknown univariate measurable function, θ⋆ is an unknown vector in Rd , and W denotes a random noise satisfying E[W |X] = 0. The single-index model is known to offer a ﬂexible way to model a variety of high-dimensional real-world phenomena. However, despite its relative simplicity, this dimension reduction scheme is faced with severe complications as soon as the underlying dimension becomes larger than the number of observations (“p larger than n” paradigm). To circumvent this difﬁculty, we consider the single-index model estimation problem from a sparsity perspective using a PAC-Bayesian approach. On the theoretical side, we offer a sharp oracle inequality, which is more powerful than the best known oracle inequalities for other common procedures of single-index recovery. The proposed method is implemented by means of the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique and its performance is compared with that of standard procedures.

<p>Author: Yahya Forghani, Hadi Sadoghi</p><p>Abstract: This paper comments on the published work dealing with robustness and regularization of support vector machines (Journal of Machine Learning Research, Vol. 10, pp. 1485-1510, 2009) by H. Xu et al. They proposed a theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the feature space and robustness in the sample space directly. In this paper, we propose a counter example that rejects their theorem. Keywords: kernel, robustness, support vector machine 1. Comment Firstly, it must be stated that Xu et al. (2009) made a good study of robustness and regularization of support vector machines. They proposed the following theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the feature space and robustness in the sample space directly: Theorem (Xu et al., 2009) Suppose that the kernel function has the form k(x, x′ ) = f ( x − x′ ), with f : R+ → R a decreasing function. Denote by H the RKHS space of k(., .) and φ(.) the corresponding feature mapping. Then we have any x ∈ Rn , w ∈ H and c > 0, sup w, φ(x − δ) = δ ≤c δφ H≤ sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, φ(x) − δφ . The following counter example rejects the mentioned theorem. However, this theorem is a standalone result in the appendix of the paper of Xu et al. (2009), which is not used anywhere else in the paper of Xu et al. (2009). Thus, the main result and all other results of Xu et al. (2009) are not affected in any way. Counter example. Let φ(.) be the feature mapping of Gaussian kernel function. We have φ(x) H = 1. Let w = φ(x). Therefore, w, φ(x) = w H , and sup w, φ(x − δ) = w δ ≤c ∗. Also at Islamic Azad University, Mashhad Branch, Mashhad, IRAN. c 2013 Yahya Forghani and Hadi Sadoghi. H. (1) F ORGHANI AND S ADOGHI Moreover, δφ δφ H≤ H≤ w, φ(x) − δφ = sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, φ(x) + sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w H δφ + δφ w H H≤ + w H≤ w, δφ = sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, δφ = sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) H 2 f (0) − 2 f (c). (2) According to Equation (1) and (2), and since f is a decreasing function, for any c > 0, we have sup w, φ(x − δ) ≤ δ ≤c δφ H≤ sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, φ(x) − δφ . End of counter example. The exact spot that the error has been occurred in the mentioned theorem is Equation (19) of the paper of Xu et al. (2009). There it has been claimed that the image of the RKHS feature mapping is dense, which unfortunately is not true. Indeed, because φ(x), φ(x) = K(0) where K(.) is the kernel function, the image of the feature mapping is in a ball of radius K(0). References Huan Xu, Shie Mannor, and Constantine Caramanis.

We study its large sample limit, providing speciﬁc rates of convergence under standard assumptions. We ﬁnd that it is consistent when the underlying submanifold is isometric to a convex subset, and we provide some simple examples where it fails to be consistent. Keywords: maximum variance unfolding, isometric embedding, U-processes, empirical processes, proximity graphs.</p><p>2 0.56717449 <a title="77-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2013-Classifier_Selection_using_the_Predicate_Depth.html">21 jmlr-2013-Classifier Selection using the Predicate Depth</a></p>
<p>Author: Ran Gilad-Bachrach, Christopher J.C. Burges</p><p>Abstract: Typically, one approaches a supervised machine learning problem by writing down an objective function and ﬁnding a hypothesis that minimizes it. This is equivalent to ﬁnding the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) hypothesis for a Boltzmann distribution. However, MAP is not a robust statistic. We present an alternative approach by deﬁning a median of the distribution, which we show is both more robust, and has good generalization guarantees. We present algorithms to approximate this median. One contribution of this work is an efﬁcient method for approximating the Tukey median. The Tukey median, which is often used for data visualization and outlier detection, is a special case of the family of medians we deﬁne: however, computing it exactly is exponentially slow in the dimension. Our algorithm approximates such medians in polynomial time while making weaker assumptions than those required by previous work. Keywords: classiﬁcation, estimation, median, Tukey depth</p><p>3 0.40611625 <a title="77-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2013-Maximum_Volume_Clustering%3A_A_New_Discriminative_Clustering_Approach.html">70 jmlr-2013-Maximum Volume Clustering: A New Discriminative Clustering Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Gang Niu, Bo Dai, Lin Shang, Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: The large volume principle proposed by Vladimir Vapnik, which advocates that hypotheses lying in an equivalence class with a larger volume are more preferable, is a useful alternative to the large margin principle. In this paper, we introduce a new discriminative clustering model based on the large volume principle called maximum volume clustering (MVC), and then propose two approximation schemes to solve this MVC model: A soft-label MVC method using sequential quadratic programming and a hard-label MVC method using semi-deﬁnite programming, respectively. The proposed MVC is theoretically advantageous for three reasons. The optimization involved in hardlabel MVC is convex, and under mild conditions, the optimization involved in soft-label MVC is akin to a convex one in terms of the resulting clusters. Secondly, the soft-label MVC method pos∗. A preliminary and shorter version has appeared in Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Statistics (Niu et al., 2011). The preliminary work was done when GN was studying at Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, and BD was studying at Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. A Matlab implementation of maximum volume clustering is available from http://sugiyama-www.cs.titech.ac.jp/∼gang/software.html. c 2013 Gang Niu, Bo Dai, Lin Shang and Masashi Sugiyama. N IU , DAI , S HANG AND S UGIYAMA sesses a clustering error bound. Thirdly, MVC includes the optimization problems of a spectral clustering, two relaxed k-means clustering and an information-maximization clustering as special limit cases when its regularization parameter goes to inﬁnity. Experiments on several artiﬁcial and benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed MVC compares favorably with state-of-the-art clustering methods.

<p>Author: Binbin Lin, Xiaofei He, Chiyuan Zhang, Ming Ji</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel local isometry based dimensionality reduction method from the perspective of vector ﬁelds, which is called parallel vector ﬁeld embedding (PFE). We ﬁrst give a discussion on local isometry and global isometry to show the intrinsic connection between parallel vector ﬁelds and isometry. The problem of ﬁnding an isometry turns out to be equivalent to ﬁnding orthonormal parallel vector ﬁelds on the data manifold. Therefore, we ﬁrst ﬁnd orthonormal parallel vector ﬁelds by solving a variational problem on the manifold. Then each embedding function can be obtained by requiring its gradient ﬁeld to be as close to the corresponding parallel vector ﬁeld as possible. Theoretical results show that our method can precisely recover the manifold if it is isometric to a connected open subset of Euclidean space. Both synthetic and real data examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method even if there is heavy noise and high curvature.

<p>Author: Nakul Verma</p><p>Abstract: Low dimensional embeddings of manifold data have gained popularity in the last decade. However, a systematic ﬁnite sample analysis of manifold embedding algorithms largely eludes researchers. Here we present two algorithms that embed a general n-dimensional manifold into Rd (where d only depends on some key manifold properties such as its intrinsic dimension, volume and curvature) that guarantee to approximately preserve all interpoint geodesic distances.

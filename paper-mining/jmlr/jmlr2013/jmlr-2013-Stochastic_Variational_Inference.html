<p>Author: Chong Wang, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: Mean-ﬁeld variational methods are widely used for approximate posterior inference in many probabilistic models. In a typical application, mean-ﬁeld methods approximately compute the posterior with a coordinate-ascent optimization algorithm. When the model is conditionally conjugate, the coordinate updates are easily derived and in closed form. However, many models of interest—like the correlated topic model and Bayesian logistic regression—are nonconjugate. In these models, mean-ﬁeld methods cannot be directly applied and practitioners have had to develop variational algorithms on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we develop two generic methods for nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for speciﬁc models; and they work well on real-world data sets. We studied our methods on the correlated topic model, Bayesian logistic regression, and hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression.

<p>Author: Matthew J. Johnson, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the ubiquitous Hidden Markov Model for learning from sequential and time-series data. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM’s strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi-Markov modeling, which has been developed mainly in the parametric non-Bayesian setting, to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicit-duration Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden semiMarkov Model (HDP-HSMM) and develop sampling algorithms for efﬁcient posterior inference. The methods we introduce also provide new methods for sampling inference in the ﬁnite Bayesian HSMM. Our modular Gibbs sampling methods can be embedded in samplers for larger hierarchical Bayesian models, adding semi-Markov chain modeling as another tool in the Bayesian inference toolbox. We demonstrate the utility of the HDP-HSMM and our inference methods on both synthetic and real experiments.

<p>Author: Edward Challis, David Barber</p><p>Abstract: We investigate Gaussian Kullback-Leibler (G-KL) variational approximate inference techniques for Bayesian generalised linear models and various extensions. In particular we make the following novel contributions: sufﬁcient conditions for which the G-KL objective is differentiable and convex are described; constrained parameterisations of Gaussian covariance that make G-KL methods fast and scalable are provided; the lower bound to the normalisation constant provided by G-KL methods is proven to dominate those provided by local lower bounding methods; complexity and model applicability issues of G-KL versus other Gaussian approximate inference methods are discussed. Numerical results comparing G-KL and other deterministic Gaussian approximate inference methods are presented for: robust Gaussian process regression models with either Student-t or Laplace likelihoods, large scale Bayesian binary logistic regression models, and Bayesian sparse linear models for sequential experimental design.

<p>Author: Manavender R. Malgireddy, Ifeoma Nwogu, Venu Govindaraju</p><p>Abstract: We present language-motivated approaches to detecting, localizing and classifying activities and gestures in videos. In order to obtain statistical insight into the underlying patterns of motions in activities, we develop a dynamic, hierarchical Bayesian model which connects low-level visual features in videos with poses, motion patterns and classes of activities. This process is somewhat analogous to the method of detecting topics or categories from documents based on the word content of the documents, except that our documents are dynamic. The proposed generative model harnesses both the temporal ordering power of dynamic Bayesian networks such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and the automatic clustering power of hierarchical Bayesian models such as the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. We also introduce a probabilistic framework for detecting and localizing pre-speciﬁed activities (or gestures) in a video sequence, analogous to the use of ﬁller models for keyword detection in speech processing. We demonstrate the robustness of our classiﬁcation model and our spotting framework by recognizing activities in unconstrained real-life video sequences and by spotting gestures via a one-shot-learning approach.

<p>Author: Philémon Brakel, Dirk Stroobandt, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Imputing missing values in high dimensional time-series is a difﬁcult problem. This paper presents a strategy for training energy-based graphical models for imputation directly, bypassing difﬁculties probabilistic approaches would face. The training strategy is inspired by recent work on optimization-based learning (Domke, 2012) and allows complex neural models with convolutional and recurrent structures to be trained for imputation tasks. In this work, we use this training strategy to derive learning rules for three substantially different neural architectures. Inference in these models is done by either truncated gradient descent or variational mean-ﬁeld iterations. In our experiments, we found that the training methods outperform the Contrastive Divergence learning algorithm. Moreover, the training methods can easily handle missing values in the training data itself during learning. We demonstrate the performance of this learning scheme and the three models we introduce on one artiﬁcial and two real-world data sets.

<p>Author: Wei Wu, Zhengdong  Lu, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: The task of matching data from two heterogeneous domains naturally arises in various areas such as web search, collaborative ﬁltering, and drug design. In web search, existing work has designed relevance models to match queries and documents by exploiting either user clicks or content of queries and documents. To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been little work on principled approaches to leveraging both clicks and content to learn a matching model for search. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning to match heterogeneous objects. The framework learns two linear mappings for two objects respectively, and matches them via the dot product of their images after mapping. Moreover, when different regularizations are enforced, the framework renders a rich family of matching models. With orthonormal constraints on mapping functions, the framework subsumes Partial Least Squares (PLS) as a special case. Alternatively, with a ℓ1 +ℓ2 regularization, we obtain a new model called Regularized Mapping to Latent Structures (RMLS). RMLS enjoys many advantages over PLS, including lower time complexity and easy parallelization. To further understand the matching framework, we conduct generalization analysis and apply the result to both PLS and RMLS. We apply the framework to web search and implement both PLS and RMLS using a click-through bipartite with metadata representing features of queries and documents. We test the efﬁcacy and scalability of RMLS and PLS on large scale web search problems. The results show that both PLS and RMLS can signiﬁcantly outperform baseline methods, while RMLS substantially speeds up the learning process.

<p>Author: Matthew D. Hoffman, David M. Blei, Chong Wang, John Paisley</p><p>Abstract: We develop stochastic variational inference, a scalable algorithm for approximating posterior distributions. We develop this technique for a large class of probabilistic models and we demonstrate it with two probabilistic topic models, latent Dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical Dirichlet process topic model. Using stochastic variational inference, we analyze several large collections of documents: 300K articles from Nature, 1.8M articles from The New York Times, and 3.8M articles from Wikipedia. Stochastic inference can easily handle data sets of this size and outperforms traditional variational inference, which can only handle a smaller subset. (We also show that the Bayesian nonparametric topic model outperforms its parametric counterpart.) Stochastic variational inference lets us apply complex Bayesian models to massive data sets.

<p>Author: Chong Wang, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: Mean-ﬁeld variational methods are widely used for approximate posterior inference in many probabilistic models. In a typical application, mean-ﬁeld methods approximately compute the posterior with a coordinate-ascent optimization algorithm. When the model is conditionally conjugate, the coordinate updates are easily derived and in closed form. However, many models of interest—like the correlated topic model and Bayesian logistic regression—are nonconjugate. In these models, mean-ﬁeld methods cannot be directly applied and practitioners have had to develop variational algorithms on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we develop two generic methods for nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for speciﬁc models; and they work well on real-world data sets. We studied our methods on the correlated topic model, Bayesian logistic regression, and hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression.

<p>Author: Rob Hall, Alessandro Rinaldo, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: Differential privacy is a rigorous cryptographically-motivated characterization of data privacy which may be applied when releasing summaries of a database. Previous work has focused mainly on methods for which the output is a ﬁnite dimensional vector, or an element of some discrete set. We develop methods for releasing functions while preserving differential privacy. Speciﬁcally, we show that adding an appropriate Gaussian process to the function of interest yields differential privacy. When the functions lie in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) generated by the covariance kernel of the Gaussian process, then the correct noise level is established by measuring the “sensitivity” of the function in the RKHS norm. As examples we consider kernel density estimation, kernel support vector machines, and functions in RKHSs.

<p>Author: Samuel Gerber, Ross Whitaker</p><p>Abstract: Principal curves and manifolds provide a framework to formulate manifold learning within a statistical context. Principal curves deﬁne the notion of a curve passing through the middle of a distribution. While the intuition is clear, the formal deﬁnition leads to some technical and practical difﬁculties. In particular, principal curves are saddle points of the mean-squared projection distance, which poses severe challenges for estimation and model selection. This paper demonstrates that the difﬁculties in model selection associated with the saddle point property of principal curves are intrinsically tied to the minimization of the mean-squared projection distance. We introduce a new objective function, facilitated through a modiﬁcation of the principal curve estimation approach, for which all critical points are principal curves and minima. Thus, the new formulation removes the fundamental issue for model selection in principal curve estimation. A gradient-descent-based estimator demonstrates the effectiveness of the new formulation for controlling model complexity on numerical experiments with synthetic and real data.

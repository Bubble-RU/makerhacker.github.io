<p>Author: Binbin Lin, Xiaofei He, Chiyuan Zhang, Ming Ji</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel local isometry based dimensionality reduction method from the perspective of vector ﬁelds, which is called parallel vector ﬁeld embedding (PFE). We ﬁrst give a discussion on local isometry and global isometry to show the intrinsic connection between parallel vector ﬁelds and isometry. The problem of ﬁnding an isometry turns out to be equivalent to ﬁnding orthonormal parallel vector ﬁelds on the data manifold. Therefore, we ﬁrst ﬁnd orthonormal parallel vector ﬁelds by solving a variational problem on the manifold. Then each embedding function can be obtained by requiring its gradient ﬁeld to be as close to the corresponding parallel vector ﬁeld as possible. Theoretical results show that our method can precisely recover the manifold if it is isometric to a connected open subset of Euclidean space. Both synthetic and real data examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method even if there is heavy noise and high curvature.

<p>Author: Matthew J. Urry, Peter Sollich</p><p>Abstract: We consider learning on graphs, guided by kernels that encode similarity between vertices. Our focus is on random walk kernels, the analogues of squared exponential kernels in Euclidean spaces. We show that on large, locally treelike graphs these have some counter-intuitive properties, specifically in the limit of large kernel lengthscales. We consider using these kernels as covariance functions of Gaussian processes. In this situation one typically scales the prior globally to normalise the average of the prior variance across vertices. We demonstrate that, in contrast to the Euclidean case, this generically leads to signiﬁcant variation in the prior variance across vertices, which is undesirable from a probabilistic modelling point of view. We suggest the random walk kernel should be normalised locally, so that each vertex has the same prior variance, and analyse the consequences of this by studying learning curves for Gaussian process regression. Numerical calculations as well as novel theoretical predictions for the learning curves using belief propagation show that one obtains distinctly different probabilistic models depending on the choice of normalisation. Our method for predicting the learning curves using belief propagation is signiﬁcantly more accurate than previous approximations and should become exact in the limit of large random graphs.

<p>Author: Ameet Talwalkar, Sanjiv Kumar, Mehryar Mohri, Henry Rowley</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the efﬁcacy of sampling-based low-rank approximation techniques when applied to large dense kernel matrices. We analyze two common approximate singular value decomposition techniques, namely the Nystr¨ m and Column sampling methods. We present a theoretical o comparison between these two methods, provide novel insights regarding their suitability for various tasks and present experimental results that support our theory. Our results illustrate the relative strengths of each method. We next examine the performance of these two techniques on the largescale task of extracting low-dimensional manifold structure given millions of high-dimensional face images. We address the computational challenges of non-linear dimensionality reduction via Isomap and Laplacian Eigenmaps, using a graph containing about 18 million nodes and 65 million edges. We present extensive experiments on learning low-dimensional embeddings for two large face data sets: CMU-PIE (35 thousand faces) and a web data set (18 million faces). Our comparisons show that the Nystr¨ m approximation is superior to the Column sampling method for this o task. Furthermore, approximate Isomap tends to perform better than Laplacian Eigenmaps on both clustering and classiﬁcation with the labeled CMU-PIE data set.

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Fabio Vitale, Giovanni Zappella</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of sequentially predicting the binary labels on the nodes of an arbitrary weighted graph. We show that, under a suitable parametrization of the problem, the optimal number of prediction mistakes can be characterized (up to logarithmic factors) by the cutsize of a random spanning tree of the graph. The cutsize is induced by the unknown adversarial labeling of the graph nodes. In deriving our characterization, we obtain a simple randomized algorithm achieving in expectation the optimal mistake bound on any polynomially connected weighted graph. Our algorithm draws a random spanning tree of the original graph and then predicts the nodes of this tree in constant expected amortized time and linear space. Experiments on real-world data sets show that our method compares well to both global (Perceptron) and local (label propagation) methods, while being generally faster in practice.

<p>Author: Philémon Brakel, Dirk Stroobandt, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Imputing missing values in high dimensional time-series is a difﬁcult problem. This paper presents a strategy for training energy-based graphical models for imputation directly, bypassing difﬁculties probabilistic approaches would face. The training strategy is inspired by recent work on optimization-based learning (Domke, 2012) and allows complex neural models with convolutional and recurrent structures to be trained for imputation tasks. In this work, we use this training strategy to derive learning rules for three substantially different neural architectures. Inference in these models is done by either truncated gradient descent or variational mean-ﬁeld iterations. In our experiments, we found that the training methods outperform the Contrastive Divergence learning algorithm. Moreover, the training methods can easily handle missing values in the training data itself during learning. We demonstrate the performance of this learning scheme and the three models we introduce on one artiﬁcial and two real-world data sets.

<p>Author: Anastasios Roussos, Stavros Theodorakis, Vassilis Pitsikalis, Petros Maragos</p><p>Abstract: We propose the novel approach of dynamic afﬁne-invariant shape-appearance model (Aff-SAM) and employ it for handshape classiﬁcation and sign recognition in sign language (SL) videos. AffSAM offers a compact and descriptive representation of hand conﬁgurations as well as regularized model-ﬁtting, assisting hand tracking and extracting handshape features. We construct SA images representing the hand’s shape and appearance without landmark points. We model the variation of the images by linear combinations of eigenimages followed by afﬁne transformations, accounting for 3D hand pose changes and improving model’s compactness. We also incorporate static and dynamic handshape priors, offering robustness in occlusions, which occur often in signing. The approach includes an afﬁne signer adaptation component at the visual level, without requiring training from scratch a new singer-speciﬁc model. We rather employ a short development data set to adapt the models for a new signer. Experiments on the Boston-University-400 continuous SL corpus demonstrate improvements on handshape classiﬁcation when compared to other feature extraction approaches. Supplementary evaluations of sign recognition experiments, are conducted on a multi-signer, 100-sign data set, from the Greek sign language lemmas corpus. These explore the fusion with movement cues as well as signer adaptation of Aff-SAM to multiple signers providing promising results.

<p>Author: Lisha Chen, Andreas Buja</p><p>Abstract: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is the art of reconstructing pointsets (embeddings) from pairwise distance data, and as such it is at the basis of several approaches to nonlinear dimension reduction and manifold learning. At present, MDS lacks a unifying methodology as it consists of a discrete collection of proposals that differ in their optimization criteria, called “stress functions”. To correct this situation we propose (1) to embed many of the extant stress functions in a parametric family of stress functions, and (2) to replace the ad hoc choice among discrete proposals with a principled parameter selection method. This methodology yields the following beneﬁts and problem solutions: (a) It provides guidance in tailoring stress functions to a given data situation, responding to the fact that no single stress function dominates all others across all data situations; (b) the methodology enriches the supply of available stress functions; (c) it helps our understanding of stress functions by replacing the comparison of discrete proposals with a characterization of the effect of parameters on embeddings; (d) it builds a bridge to graph drawing, which is the related but not identical art of constructing embeddings from graphs.

<p>Author: Pierre Neuvial</p><p>Abstract: The False Discovery Rate (FDR) is a commonly used type I error rate in multiple testing problems. It is deﬁned as the expected False Discovery Proportion (FDP), that is, the expected fraction of false positives among rejected hypotheses. When the hypotheses are independent, the BenjaminiHochberg procedure achieves FDR control at any pre-speciﬁed level. By construction, FDR control offers no guarantee in terms of power, or type II error. A number of alternative procedures have been developed, including plug-in procedures that aim at gaining power by incorporating an estimate of the proportion of true null hypotheses. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of a class of plug-in procedures based on kernel estimators of the density of the p-values, as the number m of tested hypotheses grows to inﬁnity. In a setting where the hypotheses tested are independent, we prove that these procedures are asymptotically more powerful in two respects: (i) a tighter asymptotic FDR control for any target FDR level and (ii) a broader range of target levels yielding positive asymptotic power. We also show that this increased asymptotic power comes at the price of slower, non-parametric convergence rates for the FDP. These rates are of the form m−k/(2k+1) , where k is determined by the regularity of the density of the p-value distribution, or, equivalently, of the test statistics distribution. These results are applied to one- and two-sided tests statistics for Gaussian and Laplace location models, and for the Student model.

<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Ulrich Paquet, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) provides a framework for approximate inference. When the model under consideration is over a latent Gaussian ﬁeld, with the approximation being Gaussian, we show how these approximations can systematically be corrected. A perturbative expansion is made of the exact but intractable correction, and can be applied to the model’s partition function and other moments of interest. The correction is expressed over the higher-order cumulants which are neglected by EP’s local matching of moments. Through the expansion, we see that EP is correct to ﬁrst order. By considering higher orders, corrections of increasing polynomial complexity can be applied to the approximation. The second order provides a correction in quadratic time, which we apply to an array of Gaussian process and Ising models. The corrections generalize to arbitrarily complex approximating families, which we illustrate on tree-structured Ising model approximations. Furthermore, they provide a polynomial-time assessment of the approximation error. We also provide both theoretical and practical insights on the exactness of the EP solution.

<p>Author: Daniel Kyu Hwa Kohlsdorf, Thad E. Starner</p><p>Abstract: Gestures for interfaces should be short, pleasing, intuitive, and easily recognized by a computer. However, it is a challenge for interface designers to create gestures easily distinguishable from users’ normal movements. Our tool MAGIC Summoning addresses this problem. Given a speciﬁc platform and task, we gather a large database of unlabeled sensor data captured in the environments in which the system will be used (an “Everyday Gesture Library” or EGL). The EGL is quantized and indexed via multi-dimensional Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) to enable quick searching. MAGIC exploits the SAX representation of the EGL to suggest gestures with a low likelihood of false triggering. Suggested gestures are ordered according to brevity and simplicity, freeing the interface designer to focus on the user experience. Once a gesture is selected, MAGIC can output synthetic examples of the gesture to train a chosen classiﬁer (for example, with a hidden Markov model). If the interface designer suggests his own gesture and provides several examples, MAGIC estimates how accurately that gesture can be recognized and estimates its false positive rate by comparing it against the natural movements in the EGL. We demonstrate MAGIC’s effectiveness in gesture selection and helpfulness in creating accurate gesture recognizers.

<p>Author: Ameet Talwalkar, Sanjiv Kumar, Mehryar Mohri, Henry Rowley</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the efﬁcacy of sampling-based low-rank approximation techniques when applied to large dense kernel matrices. We analyze two common approximate singular value decomposition techniques, namely the Nystr¨ m and Column sampling methods. We present a theoretical o comparison between these two methods, provide novel insights regarding their suitability for various tasks and present experimental results that support our theory. Our results illustrate the relative strengths of each method. We next examine the performance of these two techniques on the largescale task of extracting low-dimensional manifold structure given millions of high-dimensional face images. We address the computational challenges of non-linear dimensionality reduction via Isomap and Laplacian Eigenmaps, using a graph containing about 18 million nodes and 65 million edges. We present extensive experiments on learning low-dimensional embeddings for two large face data sets: CMU-PIE (35 thousand faces) and a web data set (18 million faces). Our comparisons show that the Nystr¨ m approximation is superior to the Column sampling method for this o task. Furthermore, approximate Isomap tends to perform better than Laplacian Eigenmaps on both clustering and classiﬁcation with the labeled CMU-PIE data set.

<p>Author: Antony Joseph</p><p>Abstract: The performance of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for variable selection is analyzed for random designs. When contrasted with the deterministic case, since the performance is here measured after averaging over the distribution of the design matrix, one can have far less stringent sparsity constraints on the coefﬁcient vector. We demonstrate that for exact sparse vectors, the performance of the OMP is similar to known results on the Lasso algorithm (Wainwright, 2009). Moreover, variable selection under a more relaxed sparsity assumption on the coefﬁcient vector, whereby one has only control on the ℓ1 norm of the smaller coefﬁcients, is also analyzed. As consequence of these results, we also show that the coefﬁcient estimate satisﬁes strong oracle type inequalities.

<p>Author: Yu-Feng Li, Ivor W. Tsang, James T. Kwok, Zhi-Hua Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning from weakly labeled data, where labels of the training examples are incomplete. This includes, for example, (i) semi-supervised learning where labels are partially known; (ii) multi-instance learning where labels are implicitly known; and (iii) clustering where labels are completely unknown. Unlike supervised learning, learning with weak labels involves a difﬁcult Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Therefore, it can suffer from poor scalability and may also get stuck in local minimum. In this paper, we focus on SVMs and propose the W ELL SVM via a novel label generation strategy. This leads to a convex relaxation of the original MIP, which is at least as tight as existing convex Semi-Deﬁnite Programming (SDP) relaxations. Moreover, the W ELL SVM can be solved via a sequence of SVM subproblems that are much more scalable than previous convex SDP relaxations. Experiments on three weakly labeled learning tasks, namely, (i) semi-supervised learning; (ii) multi-instance learning for locating regions of interest in content-based information retrieval; and (iii) clustering, clearly demonstrate improved performance, and W ELL SVM is also readily applicable on large data sets.

<p>Author: Matthew J. Urry, Peter Sollich</p><p>Abstract: We consider learning on graphs, guided by kernels that encode similarity between vertices. Our focus is on random walk kernels, the analogues of squared exponential kernels in Euclidean spaces. We show that on large, locally treelike graphs these have some counter-intuitive properties, specifically in the limit of large kernel lengthscales. We consider using these kernels as covariance functions of Gaussian processes. In this situation one typically scales the prior globally to normalise the average of the prior variance across vertices. We demonstrate that, in contrast to the Euclidean case, this generically leads to signiﬁcant variation in the prior variance across vertices, which is undesirable from a probabilistic modelling point of view. We suggest the random walk kernel should be normalised locally, so that each vertex has the same prior variance, and analyse the consequences of this by studying learning curves for Gaussian process regression. Numerical calculations as well as novel theoretical predictions for the learning curves using belief propagation show that one obtains distinctly different probabilistic models depending on the choice of normalisation. Our method for predicting the learning curves using belief propagation is signiﬁcantly more accurate than previous approximations and should become exact in the limit of large random graphs.

<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: We consider supervised learning problems where the features are embedded in a graph, such as gene expressions in a gene network. In this context, it is of much interest to automatically select a subgraph with few connected components; by exploiting prior knowledge, one can indeed improve the prediction performance or obtain results that are easier to interpret. Regularization or penalty functions for selecting features in graphs have recently been proposed, but they raise new algorithmic challenges. For example, they typically require solving a combinatorially hard selection problem among all connected subgraphs. In this paper, we propose computationally feasible strategies to select a sparse and well-connected subset of features sitting on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We introduce structured sparsity penalties over paths on a DAG called “path coding” penalties. Unlike existing regularization functions that model long-range interactions between features in a graph, path coding penalties are tractable. The penalties and their proximal operators involve path selection problems, which we efﬁciently solve by leveraging network ﬂow optimization. We experimentally show on synthetic, image, and genomic data that our approach is scalable and leads to more connected subgraphs than other regularization functions for graphs.

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Fabio Vitale, Giovanni Zappella</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of sequentially predicting the binary labels on the nodes of an arbitrary weighted graph. We show that, under a suitable parametrization of the problem, the optimal number of prediction mistakes can be characterized (up to logarithmic factors) by the cutsize of a random spanning tree of the graph. The cutsize is induced by the unknown adversarial labeling of the graph nodes. In deriving our characterization, we obtain a simple randomized algorithm achieving in expectation the optimal mistake bound on any polynomially connected weighted graph. Our algorithm draws a random spanning tree of the original graph and then predicts the nodes of this tree in constant expected amortized time and linear space. Experiments on real-world data sets show that our method compares well to both global (Perceptron) and local (label propagation) methods, while being generally faster in practice.

<p>Author: Sergey Lisitsyn, Christian Widmer, Fernando J. Iglesias Garcia</p><p>Abstract: We present Tapkee, a C++ template library that provides efﬁcient implementations of more than 20 widely used dimensionality reduction techniques ranging from Locally Linear Embedding (Roweis and Saul, 2000) and Isomap (de Silva and Tenenbaum, 2002) to the recently introduced BarnesHut-SNE (van der Maaten, 2013). Our library was designed with a focus on performance and ﬂexibility. For performance, we combine efﬁcient multi-core algorithms, modern data structures and state-of-the-art low-level libraries. To achieve ﬂexibility, we designed a clean interface for applying methods to user data and provide a callback API that facilitates integration with the library. The library is freely available as open-source software and is distributed under the permissive BSD 3-clause license. We encourage the integration of Tapkee into other open-source toolboxes and libraries. For example, Tapkee has been integrated into the codebase of the Shogun toolbox (Sonnenburg et al., 2010), giving us access to a rich set of kernels, distance measures and bindings to common programming languages including Python, Octave, Matlab, R, Java, C#, Ruby, Perl and Lua. Source code, examples and documentation are available at http://tapkee.lisitsyn.me.

<p>Author: Kenji Fukumizu, Le Song, Arthur Gretton</p><p>Abstract: A kernel method for realizing Bayes’ rule is proposed, based on representations of probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Probabilities are uniquely characterized by the mean of the canonical map to the RKHS. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed in terms of RKHS functions of an empirical sample: no explicit parametric model is needed for these quantities. The posterior is likewise an RKHS mean of a weighted sample. The estimator for the expectation of a function of the posterior is derived, and rates of consistency are shown. Some representative applications of the kernel Bayes’ rule are presented, including Bayesian computation without likelihood and ﬁltering with a nonparametric state-space model.

<p>Author: Chong Zhang, Yufeng Liu</p><p>Abstract: Hard and soft classiﬁers are two important groups of techniques for classiﬁcation problems. Logistic regression and Support Vector Machines are typical examples of soft and hard classiﬁers respectively. The essential difference between these two groups is whether one needs to estimate the class conditional probability for the classiﬁcation task or not. In particular, soft classiﬁers predict the label based on the obtained class conditional probabilities, while hard classiﬁers bypass the estimation of probabilities and focus on the decision boundary. In practice, for the goal of accurate classiﬁcation, it is unclear which one to use in a given situation. To tackle this problem, the Largemargin Uniﬁed Machine (LUM) was recently proposed as a uniﬁed family to embrace both groups. The LUM family enables one to study the behavior change from soft to hard binary classiﬁers. For multicategory cases, however, the concept of soft and hard classiﬁcation becomes less clear. In that case, class probability estimation becomes more involved as it requires estimation of a probability vector. In this paper, we propose a new Multicategory LUM (MLUM) framework to investigate the behavior of soft versus hard classiﬁcation under multicategory settings. Our theoretical and numerical results help to shed some light on the nature of multicategory classiﬁcation and its transition behavior from soft to hard classiﬁers. The numerical results suggest that the proposed tuned MLUM yields very competitive performance.

<p>Author: Vinay Jethava, Anders Martinsson, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Devdatt Dubhashi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we establish that the Lov´ sz ϑ function on a graph can be restated as a kernel learning a problem. We introduce the notion of SVM − ϑ graphs, on which Lov´ sz ϑ function can be apa proximated well by a Support vector machine (SVM). We show that Erd¨ s-R´ nyi random G(n, p) o e log4 n np graphs are SVM − ϑ graphs for n ≤ p < 1. Even if we embed a large clique of size Θ 1−p in a G(n, p) graph the resultant graph still remains a SVM − ϑ graph. This immediately suggests an SVM based algorithm for recovering a large planted clique in random graphs. Associated with the ϑ function is the notion of orthogonal labellings. We introduce common orthogonal labellings which extends the idea of orthogonal labellings to multiple graphs. This allows us to propose a Multiple Kernel learning (MKL) based solution which is capable of identifying a large common dense subgraph in multiple graphs. Both in the planted clique case and common subgraph detection problem the proposed solutions beat the state of the art by an order of magnitude.

<p>Author: Ryan R. Curtin, James R. Cline, N. P. Slagle, William B. March, Parikshit Ram, Nishant A. Mehta, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: MLPACK is a state-of-the-art, scalable, multi-platform C++ machine learning library released in late 2011 offering both a simple, consistent API accessible to novice users and high performance and ﬂexibility to expert users by leveraging modern features of C++. MLPACK provides cutting-edge algorithms whose benchmarks exhibit far better performance than other leading machine learning libraries. MLPACK version 1.0.3, licensed under the LGPL, is available at http://www.mlpack.org. Keywords: C++, dual-tree algorithms, machine learning software, open source software, largescale learning 1. Introduction and Goals Though several machine learning libraries are freely available online, few, if any, offer efﬁcient algorithms to the average user. For instance, the popular Weka toolkit (Hall et al., 2009) emphasizes ease of use but scales poorly; the distributed Apache Mahout library offers scalability at a cost of higher overhead (such as clusters and powerful servers often unavailable to the average user). Also, few libraries offer breadth; for instance, libsvm (Chang and Lin, 2011) and the Tilburg MemoryBased Learner (TiMBL) are highly scalable and accessible yet each offer only a single method. MLPACK, intended to be the machine learning analog to the general-purpose LAPACK linear algebra library, aims to combine efﬁciency and accessibility. Written in C++, MLPACK uses the highly efﬁcient Armadillo matrix library (Sanderson, 2010) and is freely available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Through the use of C++ templates, MLPACK both eliminates unnecessary copying of data sets and performs expression optimizations unavailable in other languages. Also, MLPACK is, to our knowledge, unique among existing libraries in using generic programming features of C++ to allow customization of the available machine learning methods without incurring performance penalties. c 2013 Ryan R.

Finally, the source code provides references and comprehensive documentation. Four major goals of the development team of MLPACK are • • • • to implement scalable, fast machine learning algorithms, to design an intuitive, consistent, and simple API for non-expert users, to implement a variety of machine learning methods, and to provide cutting-edge machine learning algorithms unavailable elsewhere. This paper offers both an introduction to the simple and extensible API and a glimpse of the superior performance of the library. 2. Package Overview Each algorithm available in MLPACK features both a set of C++ library functions and a standalone command-line executable. Version 1.0.3 includes the following methods: • • • • • • • • • • • • • • nearest/furthest neighbor search with cover trees or kd-trees (k-nearest-neighbors) range search with cover trees or kd-trees Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) hidden Markov models (HMMs) LARS / Lasso regression k-means clustering fast hierarchical clustering (Euclidean MST calculation)1 (March et al., 2010) kernel PCA (and regular PCA) local coordinate coding1 (Yu et al., 2009) sparse coding using dictionary learning RADICAL (Robust, Accurate, Direct ICA aLgorithm) (Learned-Miller and Fisher, 2003) maximum variance unfolding (MVU) via LRSDP1 (Burer and Monteiro, 2003) the naive Bayes classiﬁer density estimation trees1 (Ram and Gray, 2011) The development team manages MLPACK with Subversion and the Trac bug reporting system, allowing easy downloads and simple bug reporting. The entire development process is transparent, so any interested user can easily contribute to the library. MLPACK can compile from source on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows; currently, different Linux distributions are reviewing MLPACK for inclusion in their package managers, which will allow users to install MLPACK without needing to compile from source. 3. A Consistent, Simple API MLPACK features a highly accessible API, both in style (such as consistent naming schemes and coding conventions) and ease of use (such as templated defaults), as well as stringent documentation standards. Consequently, a new user can execute algorithms out-of-the-box often with little or no adjustment to parameters, while the seasoned expert can expect extreme ﬂexibility in algorithmic 1. This algorithm is not available in any other comparable software package. 802 MLPACK: A S CALABLE C++ M ACHINE L EARNING L IBRARY Data Set wine cloud wine-qual isolet miniboone yp-msd corel covtype mnist randu MLPACK 0.0003 0.0069 0.0290 13.0197 20.2045 5430.0478 4.9716 14.3449 2719.8087 1020.9142 Weka 0.0621 0.1174 0.8868 213.4735 216.1469 >9000.0000 14.4264 45.9912 >9000.0000 2665.0921 Shogun 0.0277 0.5000 4.3617 37.6190 2351.4637 >9000.0000 555.9600 >9000.0000 3536.4477 >9000.0000 MATLAB 0.0021 0.0210 0.6465 46.9518 1088.1127 >9000.0000 60.8496 >9000.0000 4838.6747 1679.2893 mlpy 0.0025 0.3520 4.0431 52.0437 3219.2696 >9000.0000 209.5056 >9000.0000 5192.3586 >9000.0000 sklearn 0.0008 0.0192 0.1668 46.8016 714.2385 >9000.0000 160.4597 651.6259 5363.9650 8780.0176 Table 1: k-NN benchmarks (in seconds).

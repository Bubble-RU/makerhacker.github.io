In this paper, we present a new constraint-based algorithm, light mutual min (LMM) for improved accuracy of BN learning from small sample data.

<p>Author: Naftali Harris, Mathias Drton</p><p>Abstract: The PC algorithm uses conditional independence tests for model selection in graphical modeling with acyclic directed graphs. In Gaussian models, tests of conditional independence are typically based on Pearson correlations, and high-dimensional consistency results have been obtained for the PC algorithm in this setting. Analyzing the error propagation from marginal to partial correlations, we prove that high-dimensional consistency carries over to a broader class of Gaussian copula or nonparanormal models when using rank-based measures of correlation. For graph sequences with bounded degree, our consistency result is as strong as prior Gaussian results. In simulations, the ‘Rank PC’ algorithm works as well as the ‘Pearson PC’ algorithm for normal data and considerably better for non-normal data, all the while incurring a negligible increase of computation time. While our interest is in the PC algorithm, the presented analysis of error propagation could be applied to other algorithms that test the vanishing of low-order partial correlations.

<p>Author: Pekka Parviainen, Mikko Koivisto</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of ﬁnding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that optimizes a decomposable Bayesian network score. While in a favorable case an optimal DAG can be found in polynomial time, in the worst case the fastest known algorithms rely on dynamic programming across the node subsets, taking time and space 2n , to within a factor polynomial in the number of nodes n. In practice, these algorithms are feasible to networks of at most around 30 nodes, mainly due to the large space requirement. Here, we generalize the dynamic programming approach to enhance its feasibility in three dimensions: ﬁrst, the user may trade space against time; second, the proposed algorithms easily and efﬁciently parallelize onto thousands of processors; third, the algorithms can exploit any prior knowledge about the precedence relation on the nodes. Underlying all these results is the key observation that, given a partial order P on the nodes, an optimal DAG compatible with P can be found in time and space roughly proportional to the number of ideals of P , which can be signiﬁcantly less than 2n . Considering sufﬁciently many carefully chosen partial orders guarantees that a globally optimal DAG will be found. Aside from the generic scheme, we present and analyze concrete tradeoff schemes based on parallel bucket orders.

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Fabio Vitale, Giovanni Zappella</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of sequentially predicting the binary labels on the nodes of an arbitrary weighted graph. We show that, under a suitable parametrization of the problem, the optimal number of prediction mistakes can be characterized (up to logarithmic factors) by the cutsize of a random spanning tree of the graph. The cutsize is induced by the unknown adversarial labeling of the graph nodes. In deriving our characterization, we obtain a simple randomized algorithm achieving in expectation the optimal mistake bound on any polynomially connected weighted graph. Our algorithm draws a random spanning tree of the original graph and then predicts the nodes of this tree in constant expected amortized time and linear space. Experiments on real-world data sets show that our method compares well to both global (Perceptron) and local (label propagation) methods, while being generally faster in practice.

<p>Author: Antti Hyttinen, Frederick Eberhardt, Patrik O. Hoyer</p><p>Abstract: Randomized controlled experiments are often described as the most reliable tool available to scientists for discovering causal relationships among quantities of interest. However, it is often unclear how many and which different experiments are needed to identify the full (possibly cyclic) causal structure among some given (possibly causally insufﬁcient) set of variables. Recent results in the causal discovery literature have explored various identiﬁability criteria that depend on the assumptions one is able to make about the underlying causal process, but these criteria are not directly constructive for selecting the optimal set of experiments. Fortunately, many of the needed constructions already exist in the combinatorics literature, albeit under terminology which is unfamiliar to most of the causal discovery community. In this paper we translate the theoretical results and apply them to the concrete problem of experiment selection. For a variety of settings we give explicit constructions of the optimal set of experiments and adapt some of the general combinatorics results to answer questions relating to the problem of experiment selection.

<p>Author: Karthik H. Shankar, Marc W. Howard</p><p>Abstract: Any learner with the ability to predict the future of a structured time-varying signal must maintain a memory of the recent past. If the signal has a characteristic timescale relevant to future prediction, the memory can be a simple shift register—a moving window extending into the past, requiring storage resources that linearly grows with the timescale to be represented. However, an independent general purpose learner cannot a priori know the characteristic prediction-relevant timescale of the signal. Moreover, many naturally occurring signals show scale-free long range correlations implying that the natural prediction-relevant timescale is essentially unbounded. Hence the learner should maintain information from the longest possible timescale allowed by resource availability. Here we construct a fuzzy memory system that optimally sacriﬁces the temporal accuracy of information in a scale-free fashion in order to represent prediction-relevant information from exponentially long timescales. Using several illustrative examples, we demonstrate the advantage of the fuzzy memory system over a shift register in time series forecasting of natural signals. When the available storage resources are limited, we suggest that a general purpose learner would be better off committing to such a fuzzy memory system.

<p>Author: Rami Mahdi, Jason Mezey</p><p>Abstract: Constraint-based learning of Bayesian networks (BN) from limited data can lead to multiple testing problems when recovering dense areas of the skeleton and to conﬂicting results in the orientation of edges. In this paper, we present a new constraint-based algorithm, light mutual min (LMM) for improved accuracy of BN learning from small sample data. LMM improves the assessment of candidate edges by using a ranking criterion that considers conditional independence on neighboring variables at both sides of an edge simultaneously. The algorithm also employs an adaptive relaxation of constraints that, selectively, allows some nodes not to condition on some neighbors. This relaxation aims at reducing the incorrect rejection of true edges connecting high degree nodes due to multiple testing. LMM additionally incorporates a new criterion for ranking v-structures that is used to recover the completed partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG) and to resolve conﬂicting v-structures, a common problem in small sample constraint-based learning. Using simulated data, each of these components of LMM is shown to signiﬁcantly improve network inference compared to commonly applied methods when learning from limited data, including more accurate recovery of skeletons and CPDAGs compared to the PC, MaxMin, and MaxMin hill climbing algorithms. A proof of asymptotic correctness is also provided for LMM for recovering the correct skeleton and CPDAG.

<p>Author: Wei Sun, Junhui Wang, Yixin Fang</p><p>Abstract: Penalized regression models are popularly used in high-dimensional data analysis to conduct variable selection and model ﬁtting simultaneously. Whereas success has been widely reported in literature, their performances largely depend on the tuning parameters that balance the trade-off between model ﬁtting and model sparsity. Existing tuning criteria mainly follow the route of minimizing the estimated prediction error or maximizing the posterior model probability, such as cross validation, AIC and BIC. This article introduces a general tuning parameter selection criterion based on variable selection stability. The key idea is to select the tuning parameters so that the resultant penalized regression model is stable in variable selection. The asymptotic selection consistency is established for both ﬁxed and diverging dimensions. Its effectiveness is also demonstrated in a variety of simulated examples as well as an application to the prostate cancer data.

<p>Author: Antony Joseph</p><p>Abstract: The performance of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for variable selection is analyzed for random designs. When contrasted with the deterministic case, since the performance is here measured after averaging over the distribution of the design matrix, one can have far less stringent sparsity constraints on the coefﬁcient vector. We demonstrate that for exact sparse vectors, the performance of the OMP is similar to known results on the Lasso algorithm (Wainwright, 2009). Moreover, variable selection under a more relaxed sparsity assumption on the coefﬁcient vector, whereby one has only control on the ℓ1 norm of the smaller coefﬁcients, is also analyzed. As consequence of these results, we also show that the coefﬁcient estimate satisﬁes strong oracle type inequalities.

<p>Author: Sean Ryan Fanello, Ilaria Gori, Giorgio Metta, Francesca Odone</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity has been showed to be one of the most important properties for visual recognition purposes. In this paper we show that sparse representation plays a fundamental role in achieving one-shot learning and real-time recognition of actions. We start off from RGBD images, combine motion and appearance cues and extract state-of-the-art features in a computationally efﬁcient way. The proposed method relies on descriptors based on 3D Histograms of Scene Flow (3DHOFs) and Global Histograms of Oriented Gradient (GHOGs); adaptive sparse coding is applied to capture high-level patterns from data. We then propose a simultaneous on-line video segmentation and recognition of actions using linear SVMs. The main contribution of the paper is an effective realtime system for one-shot action modeling and recognition; the paper highlights the effectiveness of sparse coding techniques to represent 3D actions. We obtain very good results on three different data sets: a benchmark data set for one-shot action learning (the ChaLearn Gesture Data Set), an in-house data set acquired by a Kinect sensor including complex actions and gestures differing by small details, and a data set created for human-robot interaction purposes. Finally we demonstrate that our system is effective also in a human-robot interaction setting and propose a memory game, “All Gestures You Can”, to be played against a humanoid robot.

<p>Author: Xiao-Tong Yuan, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the sparse eigenvalue problem, which is to extract dominant (largest) sparse eigenvectors with at most k non-zero components. We propose a simple yet effective solution called truncated power method that can approximately solve the underlying nonconvex optimization problem. A strong sparse recovery result is proved for the truncated power method, and this theory is our key motivation for developing the new algorithm. The proposed method is tested on applications such as sparse principal component analysis and the densest k-subgraph problem. Extensive experiments on several synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the competitive empirical performance of our method.

<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Ulrich Paquet, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) provides a framework for approximate inference. When the model under consideration is over a latent Gaussian ﬁeld, with the approximation being Gaussian, we show how these approximations can systematically be corrected. A perturbative expansion is made of the exact but intractable correction, and can be applied to the model’s partition function and other moments of interest. The correction is expressed over the higher-order cumulants which are neglected by EP’s local matching of moments. Through the expansion, we see that EP is correct to ﬁrst order. By considering higher orders, corrections of increasing polynomial complexity can be applied to the approximation. The second order provides a correction in quadratic time, which we apply to an array of Gaussian process and Ising models. The corrections generalize to arbitrarily complex approximating families, which we illustrate on tree-structured Ising model approximations. Furthermore, they provide a polynomial-time assessment of the approximation error. We also provide both theoretical and practical insights on the exactness of the EP solution.

<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: We consider supervised learning problems where the features are embedded in a graph, such as gene expressions in a gene network. In this context, it is of much interest to automatically select a subgraph with few connected components; by exploiting prior knowledge, one can indeed improve the prediction performance or obtain results that are easier to interpret. Regularization or penalty functions for selecting features in graphs have recently been proposed, but they raise new algorithmic challenges. For example, they typically require solving a combinatorially hard selection problem among all connected subgraphs. In this paper, we propose computationally feasible strategies to select a sparse and well-connected subset of features sitting on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We introduce structured sparsity penalties over paths on a DAG called “path coding” penalties. Unlike existing regularization functions that model long-range interactions between features in a graph, path coding penalties are tractable. The penalties and their proximal operators involve path selection problems, which we efﬁciently solve by leveraging network ﬂow optimization. We experimentally show on synthetic, image, and genomic data that our approach is scalable and leads to more connected subgraphs than other regularization functions for graphs.

<p>Author: Qiang Liu, Alexander Ihler</p><p>Abstract: The marginal maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem, which calculates the mode of the marginal posterior distribution of a subset of variables with the remaining variables marginalized, is an important inference problem in many models, such as those with hidden variables or uncertain parameters. Unfortunately, marginal MAP can be NP-hard even on trees, and has attracted less attention in the literature compared to the joint MAP (maximization) and marginalization problems. We derive a general dual representation for marginal MAP that naturally integrates the marginalization and maximization operations into a joint variational optimization problem, making it possible to easily extend most or all variational-based algorithms to marginal MAP. In particular, we derive a set of “mixed-product” message passing algorithms for marginal MAP, whose form is a hybrid of max-product, sum-product and a novel “argmax-product” message updates. We also derive a class of convergent algorithms based on proximal point methods, including one that transforms the marginal MAP problem into a sequence of standard marginalization problems. Theoretically, we provide guarantees under which our algorithms give globally or locally optimal solutions, and provide novel upper bounds on the optimal objectives. Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms signiﬁcantly outperform the existing approaches, including a state-of-the-art algorithm based on local search methods.

<p>Author: Indraneel Mukherjee, Cynthia Rudin, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: The AdaBoost algorithm was designed to combine many “weak” hypotheses that perform slightly better than random guessing into a “strong” hypothesis that has very low error. We study the rate at which AdaBoost iteratively converges to the minimum of the “exponential loss.” Unlike previous work, our proofs do not require a weak-learning assumption, nor do they require that minimizers of the exponential loss are ﬁnite. Our ﬁrst result shows that the exponential loss of AdaBoost’s computed parameter vector will be at most ε more than that of any parameter vector of ℓ1 -norm bounded by B in a number of rounds that is at most a polynomial in B and 1/ε. We also provide lower bounds showing that a polynomial dependence is necessary. Our second result is that within C/ε iterations, AdaBoost achieves a value of the exponential loss that is at most ε more than the best possible value, where C depends on the data set. We show that this dependence of the rate on ε is optimal up to constant factors, that is, at least Ω(1/ε) rounds are necessary to achieve within ε of the optimal exponential loss.

<p>Author: Andrea Tacchetti, Pavan K. Mallapragada, Matteo Santoro, Lorenzo Rosasco</p><p>Abstract: We present GURLS, a least squares, modular, easy-to-extend software library for efﬁcient supervised learning. GURLS is targeted to machine learning practitioners, as well as non-specialists. It offers a number state-of-the-art training strategies for medium and large-scale learning, and routines for efﬁcient model selection. The library is particularly well suited for multi-output problems (multi-category/multi-label). GURLS is currently available in two independent implementations: Matlab and C++. It takes advantage of the favorable properties of regularized least squares algorithm to exploit advanced tools in linear algebra. Routines to handle computations with very large matrices by means of memory-mapped storage and distributed task execution are available. The package is distributed under the BSD license and is available for download at https://github.com/LCSL/GURLS. Keywords: regularized least squares, big data, linear algebra 1. Introduction and Design Supervised learning has become a fundamental tool for the design of intelligent systems and the analysis of high dimensional data. Key to this success has been the availability of efﬁcient, easy-touse software packages. New data collection technologies make it easy to gather high dimensional, multi-output data sets of increasing size. This trend calls for new software solutions for the automatic training, tuning and testing of supervised learning methods. These observations motivated the design of GURLS (Grand Uniﬁed Regularized Least Squares). The package was developed to pursue the following goals: Speed: Fast training/testing procedures for learning problems with potentially large/huge number of points, features and especially outputs (e.g., classes). Memory: Flexible data management to work with large data sets by means of memory-mapped storage. Performance: ∗.

Mallapragada, Matteo Santoro and Lorenzo Rosasco. TACCHETTI , M ALLAPRAGADA , S ANTORO AND ROSASCO State of the art results in high-dimensional multi-output problems. Usability and modularity: Easy to use and to expand. GURLS is based on Regularized Least Squares (RLS) and takes advantage of all the favorable properties of these methods (Rifkin et al., 2003). Since the algorithm reduces to solving a linear system, GURLS is set up to exploit the powerful tools, and recent advances, of linear algebra (including randomized solver, ﬁrst order methods, etc.). Second, it makes use of RLS properties which are particularly suited for high dimensional learning. For example: (1) RLS has natural primal and dual formulation (hence having complexity which is the smallest between number of examples and features); (2) efﬁcient parameter selection (closed form expression of the leave one out error and efﬁcient computations of regularization path); (3) natural and efﬁcient extension to multiple outputs. Speciﬁc attention has been devoted to handle large high dimensional data sets. We rely on data structures that can be serialized using memory-mapped ﬁles, and on a distributed task manager to perform a number of key steps (such as matrix multiplication) without loading the whole data set in memory. Efforts were devoted to to provide a lean API and an exhaustive documentation. GURLS has been deployed and tested successfully on Linux, MacOS and Windows. The library is distributed under the simpliﬁed BSD license, and can be downloaded from https://github.com/LCSL/GURLS. 2. Description of the Library The library comprises four main modules. GURLS and bGURLS—both implemented in Matlab— are aimed at solving learning problems with small/medium and large-scale data sets respectively. GURLS++ and bGURLS++ are their C++ counterparts. The Matlab and C++ versions share the same design, but the C++ modules have signiﬁcant improvements, which make them faster and more ﬂexible. The speciﬁcation of the desired machine learning experiment in the library is straightforward. Basically, it is a formal description of a pipeline, that is, an ordered sequence of steps. Each step identiﬁes an actual learning task, and belongs to a predeﬁned category. The core of the library is a method (a class in the C++ implementation) called GURLScore, which is responsible for processing the sequence of tasks in the proper order and for linking the output of the former task to the input of the subsequent one. A key role is played by the additional “options” structure, referred to as OPT. OPT is used to store all conﬁguration parameters required to customize the behavior of individual tasks in the pipeline. Tasks receive conﬁguration parameters from OPT in read-only mode and—upon termination—the results are appended to the structure by GURLScore in order to make them available to subsequent tasks. This allows the user to skip the execution of some tasks in a pipeline, by simply inserting the desired results directly into the options structure. Currently, we identify six different task categories: data set splitting, kernel computation, model selection, training, evaluation and testing and performance assessment and analysis. Tasks belonging to the same category may be interchanged with each other. 2.1 Learning From Large Data Sets Two modules in GURLS have been speciﬁcally designed to deal with big data scenarios. The approach we adopted is mainly based on a memory-mapped abstraction of matrix and vector data structures, and on a distributed computation of a number of standard problems in linear algebra. For learning on big data, we decided to focus speciﬁcally on those situations where one seeks a linear model on a large set of (possibly non linear) features. A more accurate speciﬁcation of what “large” means in GURLS is related to the number of features d and the number of training 3202 GURLS: A L EAST S QUARES L IBRARY FOR S UPERVISED L EARNING data set optdigit landast pendigit letter isolet # of samples 3800 4400 7400 10000 6200 # of classes 10 6 10 26 26 # of variables 64 36 16 16 600 Table 1: Data sets description. examples n: we require it must be possible to store a min(d, n) × min(d, n) matrix in memory. In practice, this roughly means we can train models with up-to 25k features on machines with 8Gb of RAM, and up-to 50k features on machines with 36Gb of RAM. We do not require the data matrix itself to be stored in memory: within GURLS it is possible to manage an arbitrarily large set of training examples. We distinguish two different scenarios. Data sets that can fully reside in RAM without any memory mapping techniques—such as swapping—are considered to be small/medium. Larger data sets are considered to be “big” and learning must be performed using either bGURLS or bGURLS++ . These two modules include all the design patterns described above, and have been complemented with additional big data and distributed computation capabilities. Big data support is obtained using a data structure called bigarray, which allows to handle data matrices as large as the space available on the hard drive: we store the entire data set on disk and load only small chunks in memory when required. There are some differences between the Matlab and C++ implementations. bGURLS relies on a simple, ad hoc interface, called GURLS Distributed Manager (GDM), to distribute matrix-matrix multiplications, thus allowing users to perform the important task of kernel matrix computation on a distributed network of computing nodes. After this step, the subsequent tasks behave as in GURLS. bGURLS++ (currently in active development) offers more interesting features because it is based on the MPI libraries. Therefore, it allows for a full distribution within every single task of the pipeline. All the processes read the input data from a shared ﬁlesystem over the network and then start executing the same pipeline. During execution, each process’ task communicates with the corresponding ones. Every process maintains its local copy of the options. Once the same task is completed by all processes, the local copies of the options are synchronized. This architecture allows for the creation of hybrid pipelines comprising serial one-process-based tasks from GURLS++ . 3. Experiments We decided to focus the experimental analysis in the paper to the assessment of GURLS’ performance both in terms of accuracy and time. In our experiments we considered 5 popular data sets, brieﬂy described in Table 1.

The variance of the Gaussian kernel has been ﬁxed by looking at the statistics of the pairwise distances among training examples. The prediction accuracy of GURLS and GURLS++ is identical—as expected—but the implementation in C++ is signiﬁcantly faster. The prediction accuracy of standard RLS-based methods is in many cases higher than SVM. Exploiting the primal formulation of RLS, we further ran experiments with the random features approximation (Rahimi and Recht, 2008). As show in Figure 1, the performance of this method is comparable to that of SVM at a much lower computational cost in the majority of the tested data sets. We further compared GURLS with another available least squares based toolbox: the LS-SVM toolbox (Suykens et al., 2001), which includes routines for parameter selection such as coupled simulated annealing and line/grid search. The goal of this experiment is to benchmark the performance of the parameter selection with random data splitting included in GURLS. For a fair comparison, we considered only the Matlab implementation of GURLS. Results are reported in Table 2. As expected, using the linear kernel with the primal formulation—not available in LS-SVM—is the fastest approach since it leverages the lower dimensionality of the input space. When the Gaussian kernel is used, GURLS and LS-SVM have comparable computing time and classiﬁcation performance. Note, however, that in GURLS the number of parameter in the grid search is ﬁxed to 400, while in LS-SVM it may vary and is limited to 70. The interesting results obtained with the random features implementation in GURLS, make it an interesting choice in many applications. Finally, all GURLS pipelines, in their Matlab implementation, are faster than LS-SVM and further improvements can be achieved with GURLS++ .

<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Ulrich Paquet, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) provides a framework for approximate inference. When the model under consideration is over a latent Gaussian ﬁeld, with the approximation being Gaussian, we show how these approximations can systematically be corrected. A perturbative expansion is made of the exact but intractable correction, and can be applied to the model’s partition function and other moments of interest. The correction is expressed over the higher-order cumulants which are neglected by EP’s local matching of moments. Through the expansion, we see that EP is correct to ﬁrst order. By considering higher orders, corrections of increasing polynomial complexity can be applied to the approximation. The second order provides a correction in quadratic time, which we apply to an array of Gaussian process and Ising models. The corrections generalize to arbitrarily complex approximating families, which we illustrate on tree-structured Ising model approximations. Furthermore, they provide a polynomial-time assessment of the approximation error. We also provide both theoretical and practical insights on the exactness of the EP solution.

<p>Author: Kenji Fukumizu, Le Song, Arthur Gretton</p><p>Abstract: A kernel method for realizing Bayes’ rule is proposed, based on representations of probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Probabilities are uniquely characterized by the mean of the canonical map to the RKHS. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed in terms of RKHS functions of an empirical sample: no explicit parametric model is needed for these quantities. The posterior is likewise an RKHS mean of a weighted sample. The estimator for the expectation of a function of the posterior is derived, and rates of consistency are shown. Some representative applications of the kernel Bayes’ rule are presented, including Bayesian computation without likelihood and ﬁltering with a nonparametric state-space model.

<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: We consider supervised learning problems where the features are embedded in a graph, such as gene expressions in a gene network. In this context, it is of much interest to automatically select a subgraph with few connected components; by exploiting prior knowledge, one can indeed improve the prediction performance or obtain results that are easier to interpret. Regularization or penalty functions for selecting features in graphs have recently been proposed, but they raise new algorithmic challenges. For example, they typically require solving a combinatorially hard selection problem among all connected subgraphs. In this paper, we propose computationally feasible strategies to select a sparse and well-connected subset of features sitting on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We introduce structured sparsity penalties over paths on a DAG called “path coding” penalties. Unlike existing regularization functions that model long-range interactions between features in a graph, path coding penalties are tractable. The penalties and their proximal operators involve path selection problems, which we efﬁciently solve by leveraging network ﬂow optimization. We experimentally show on synthetic, image, and genomic data that our approach is scalable and leads to more connected subgraphs than other regularization functions for graphs.

<p>Author: Tingni Sun, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new method of learning a sparse nonnegative-deﬁnite target matrix. Our primary example of the target matrix is the inverse of a population covariance or correlation matrix. The algorithm ﬁrst estimates each column of the target matrix by the scaled Lasso and then adjusts the matrix estimator to be symmetric. The penalty level of the scaled Lasso for each column is completely determined by data via convex minimization, without using cross-validation. We prove that this scaled Lasso method guarantees the fastest proven rate of convergence in the spectrum norm under conditions of weaker form than those in the existing analyses of other ℓ1 regularized algorithms, and has faster guaranteed rate of convergence when the ratio of the ℓ1 and spectrum norms of the target inverse matrix diverges to inﬁnity. A simulation study demonstrates the computational feasibility and superb performance of the proposed method. Our analysis also provides new performance bounds for the Lasso and scaled Lasso to guarantee higher concentration of the error at a smaller threshold level than previous analyses, and to allow the use of the union bound in column-by-column applications of the scaled Lasso without an adjustment of the penalty level. In addition, the least squares estimation after the scaled Lasso selection is considered and proven to guarantee performance bounds similar to that of the scaled Lasso.

<p>Author: Lorenzo Rosasco, Silvia Villa, Sofia Mosci, Matteo Santoro, Alessandro Verri</p><p>Abstract: In this work we are interested in the problems of supervised learning and variable selection when the input-output dependence is described by a nonlinear function depending on a few variables. Our goal is to consider a sparse nonparametric model, hence avoiding linear or additive models. The key idea is to measure the importance of each variable in the model by making use of partial derivatives. Based on this intuition we propose a new notion of nonparametric sparsity and a corresponding least squares regularization scheme. Using concepts and results from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and proximal methods, we show that the proposed learning algorithm corresponds to a minimization problem which can be provably solved by an iterative procedure. The consistency properties of the obtained estimator are studied both in terms of prediction and selection performance. An extensive empirical analysis shows that the proposed method performs favorably with respect to the state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Author: Wei Sun, Junhui Wang, Yixin Fang</p><p>Abstract: Penalized regression models are popularly used in high-dimensional data analysis to conduct variable selection and model ﬁtting simultaneously. Whereas success has been widely reported in literature, their performances largely depend on the tuning parameters that balance the trade-off between model ﬁtting and model sparsity. Existing tuning criteria mainly follow the route of minimizing the estimated prediction error or maximizing the posterior model probability, such as cross validation, AIC and BIC. This article introduces a general tuning parameter selection criterion based on variable selection stability. The key idea is to select the tuning parameters so that the resultant penalized regression model is stable in variable selection. The asymptotic selection consistency is established for both ﬁxed and diverging dimensions. Its effectiveness is also demonstrated in a variety of simulated examples as well as an application to the prostate cancer data.

<p>Author: Yahya Forghani, Hadi Sadoghi</p><p>Abstract: This paper comments on the published work dealing with robustness and regularization of support vector machines (Journal of Machine Learning Research, Vol. 10, pp. 1485-1510, 2009) by H. Xu et al. They proposed a theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the feature space and robustness in the sample space directly. In this paper, we propose a counter example that rejects their theorem. Keywords: kernel, robustness, support vector machine 1. Comment Firstly, it must be stated that Xu et al. (2009) made a good study of robustness and regularization of support vector machines. They proposed the following theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the feature space and robustness in the sample space directly: Theorem (Xu et al., 2009) Suppose that the kernel function has the form k(x, x′ ) = f ( x − x′ ), with f : R+ → R a decreasing function. Denote by H the RKHS space of k(., .) and φ(.) the corresponding feature mapping. Then we have any x ∈ Rn , w ∈ H and c > 0, sup w, φ(x − δ) = δ ≤c δφ H≤ sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, φ(x) − δφ . The following counter example rejects the mentioned theorem. However, this theorem is a standalone result in the appendix of the paper of Xu et al. (2009), which is not used anywhere else in the paper of Xu et al. (2009). Thus, the main result and all other results of Xu et al. (2009) are not affected in any way. Counter example. Let φ(.) be the feature mapping of Gaussian kernel function. We have φ(x) H = 1. Let w = φ(x). Therefore, w, φ(x) = w H , and sup w, φ(x − δ) = w δ ≤c ∗.

(2) According to Equation (1) and (2), and since f is a decreasing function, for any c > 0, we have sup w, φ(x − δ) ≤ δ ≤c δφ H≤ sup √ 2 f (0)−2 f (c) w, φ(x) − δφ . End of counter example. The exact spot that the error has been occurred in the mentioned theorem is Equation (19) of the paper of Xu et al. (2009). There it has been claimed that the image of the RKHS feature mapping is dense, which unfortunately is not true. Indeed, because φ(x), φ(x) = K(0) where K(.) is the kernel function, the image of the feature mapping is in a ball of radius K(0). References Huan Xu, Shie Mannor, and Constantine Caramanis.

<p>Author: Fang Han, Tuo Zhao, Han Liu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a high dimensional classiﬁcation method, named the Copula Discriminant Analysis (CODA). The CODA generalizes the normal-based linear discriminant analysis to the larger Gaussian Copula models (or the nonparanormal) as proposed by Liu et al. (2009). To simultaneously achieve estimation efﬁciency and robustness, the nonparametric rank-based methods including the Spearman’s rho and Kendall’s tau are exploited in estimating the covariance matrix. In high dimensional settings, we prove that the sparsity pattern of the discriminant features can be consistently recovered with the parametric rate, and the expected misclassiﬁcation error is consistent to the Bayes risk. Our theory is backed up by careful numerical experiments, which show that the extra ﬂexibility gained by the CODA method incurs little efﬁciency loss even when the data are truly Gaussian. These results suggest that the CODA method can be an alternative choice besides the normal-based high dimensional linear discriminant analysis.

<p>Author: Tingni Sun, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new method of learning a sparse nonnegative-deﬁnite target matrix. Our primary example of the target matrix is the inverse of a population covariance or correlation matrix. The algorithm ﬁrst estimates each column of the target matrix by the scaled Lasso and then adjusts the matrix estimator to be symmetric. The penalty level of the scaled Lasso for each column is completely determined by data via convex minimization, without using cross-validation. We prove that this scaled Lasso method guarantees the fastest proven rate of convergence in the spectrum norm under conditions of weaker form than those in the existing analyses of other ℓ1 regularized algorithms, and has faster guaranteed rate of convergence when the ratio of the ℓ1 and spectrum norms of the target inverse matrix diverges to inﬁnity. A simulation study demonstrates the computational feasibility and superb performance of the proposed method. Our analysis also provides new performance bounds for the Lasso and scaled Lasso to guarantee higher concentration of the error at a smaller threshold level than previous analyses, and to allow the use of the union bound in column-by-column applications of the scaled Lasso without an adjustment of the penalty level. In addition, the least squares estimation after the scaled Lasso selection is considered and proven to guarantee performance bounds similar to that of the scaled Lasso.

<p>Author: Daniel Hernández-Lobato, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, Pierre Dupont</p><p>Abstract: We describe a Bayesian method for group feature selection in linear regression problems. The method is based on a generalized version of the standard spike-and-slab prior distribution which is often used for individual feature selection. Exact Bayesian inference under the prior considered is infeasible for typical regression problems. However, approximate inference can be carried out efﬁciently using Expectation Propagation (EP). A detailed analysis of the generalized spike-and-slab prior shows that it is well suited for regression problems that are sparse at the group level. Furthermore, this prior can be used to introduce prior knowledge about speciﬁc groups of features that are a priori believed to be more relevant. An experimental evaluation compares the performance of the proposed method with those of group LASSO, Bayesian group LASSO, automatic relevance determination and additional variants used for group feature selection. The results of these experiments show that a model based on the generalized spike-and-slab prior and the EP algorithm has state-of-the-art prediction performance in the problems analyzed. Furthermore, this model is also very useful to carry out sequential experimental design (also known as active learning), where the data instances that are most informative are iteratively included in the training set, reducing the number of instances needed to obtain a particular level of prediction accuracy.

<p>Author: Yuejia He, Yiyuan She, Dapeng Wu</p><p>Abstract: Recently, researchers have proposed penalized maximum likelihood to identify network topology underlying a dynamical system modeled by multivariate time series. The time series of interest are assumed to be stationary, but this restriction is never taken into consideration by existing estimation methods. Moreover, practical problems of interest may have ultra-high dimensionality and obvious node collinearity. In addition, none of the available algorithms provides a probabilistic measure of the uncertainty for the obtained network topology which is informative in reliable network identiﬁcation. The main purpose of this paper is to tackle these challenging issues. We propose the S2 learning framework, which stands for stationary-sparse network learning. We propose a novel algorithm referred to as the Berhu iterative sparsity pursuit with stationarity (BISPS), where the Berhu regularization can improve the Lasso in detection and estimation. The algorithm is extremely easy to implement, efﬁcient in computation and has a theoretical guarantee to converge to a global optimum. We also incorporate a screening technique into BISPS to tackle ultra-high dimensional problems and enhance computational efﬁciency. Furthermore, a stationary bootstrap technique is applied to provide connection occurring frequency for reliable topology learning. Experiments show that our method can achieve stationary and sparse causality network learning and is scalable for high-dimensional problems.

<p>Author: Aleksandr Y. Aravkin, James V. Burke, Gianluigi Pillonetto</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new class of quadratic support (QS) functions, many of which already play a crucial role in a variety of applications, including machine learning, robust statistical inference, sparsity promotion, and inverse problems such as Kalman smoothing. Well known examples of QS penalties include the ℓ2 , Huber, ℓ1 and Vapnik losses. We build on a dual representation for QS functions, using it to characterize conditions necessary to interpret these functions as negative logs of true probability densities. This interpretation establishes the foundation for statistical modeling with both known and new QS loss functions, and enables construction of non-smooth multivariate distributions with speciﬁed means and variances from simple scalar building blocks. The main contribution of this paper is a ﬂexible statistical modeling framework for a variety of learning applications, together with a toolbox of efﬁcient numerical methods for estimation. In particular, a broad subclass of QS loss functions known as piecewise linear quadratic (PLQ) penalties has a dual representation that can be exploited to design interior point (IP) methods. IP methods solve nonsmooth optimization problems by working directly with smooth systems of equations characterizing their optimality. We provide several numerical examples, along with a code that can be used to solve general PLQ problems. The efﬁciency of the IP approach depends on the structure of particular applications. We consider the class of dynamic inverse problems using Kalman smoothing. This class comprises a wide variety of applications, where the aim is to reconstruct the state of a dynamical system with known process and measurement models starting from noisy output samples.

<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: We consider supervised learning problems where the features are embedded in a graph, such as gene expressions in a gene network. In this context, it is of much interest to automatically select a subgraph with few connected components; by exploiting prior knowledge, one can indeed improve the prediction performance or obtain results that are easier to interpret. Regularization or penalty functions for selecting features in graphs have recently been proposed, but they raise new algorithmic challenges. For example, they typically require solving a combinatorially hard selection problem among all connected subgraphs. In this paper, we propose computationally feasible strategies to select a sparse and well-connected subset of features sitting on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We introduce structured sparsity penalties over paths on a DAG called “path coding” penalties. Unlike existing regularization functions that model long-range interactions between features in a graph, path coding penalties are tractable. The penalties and their proximal operators involve path selection problems, which we efﬁciently solve by leveraging network ﬂow optimization. We experimentally show on synthetic, image, and genomic data that our approach is scalable and leads to more connected subgraphs than other regularization functions for graphs.

<p>Author: Lorenzo Rosasco, Silvia Villa, Sofia Mosci, Matteo Santoro, Alessandro Verri</p><p>Abstract: In this work we are interested in the problems of supervised learning and variable selection when the input-output dependence is described by a nonlinear function depending on a few variables. Our goal is to consider a sparse nonparametric model, hence avoiding linear or additive models. The key idea is to measure the importance of each variable in the model by making use of partial derivatives. Based on this intuition we propose a new notion of nonparametric sparsity and a corresponding least squares regularization scheme. Using concepts and results from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and proximal methods, we show that the proposed learning algorithm corresponds to a minimization problem which can be provably solved by an iterative procedure. The consistency properties of the obtained estimator are studied both in terms of prediction and selection performance. An extensive empirical analysis shows that the proposed method performs favorably with respect to the state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Author: Antony Joseph</p><p>Abstract: The performance of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for variable selection is analyzed for random designs. When contrasted with the deterministic case, since the performance is here measured after averaging over the distribution of the design matrix, one can have far less stringent sparsity constraints on the coefﬁcient vector. We demonstrate that for exact sparse vectors, the performance of the OMP is similar to known results on the Lasso algorithm (Wainwright, 2009). Moreover, variable selection under a more relaxed sparsity assumption on the coefﬁcient vector, whereby one has only control on the ℓ1 norm of the smaller coefﬁcients, is also analyzed. As consequence of these results, we also show that the coefﬁcient estimate satisﬁes strong oracle type inequalities.

<p>Author: Wei Sun, Junhui Wang, Yixin Fang</p><p>Abstract: Penalized regression models are popularly used in high-dimensional data analysis to conduct variable selection and model ﬁtting simultaneously. Whereas success has been widely reported in literature, their performances largely depend on the tuning parameters that balance the trade-off between model ﬁtting and model sparsity. Existing tuning criteria mainly follow the route of minimizing the estimated prediction error or maximizing the posterior model probability, such as cross validation, AIC and BIC. This article introduces a general tuning parameter selection criterion based on variable selection stability. The key idea is to select the tuning parameters so that the resultant penalized regression model is stable in variable selection. The asymptotic selection consistency is established for both ﬁxed and diverging dimensions. Its effectiveness is also demonstrated in a variety of simulated examples as well as an application to the prostate cancer data.

<p>Author: Fang Han, Tuo Zhao, Han Liu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a high dimensional classiﬁcation method, named the Copula Discriminant Analysis (CODA). The CODA generalizes the normal-based linear discriminant analysis to the larger Gaussian Copula models (or the nonparanormal) as proposed by Liu et al. (2009). To simultaneously achieve estimation efﬁciency and robustness, the nonparametric rank-based methods including the Spearman’s rho and Kendall’s tau are exploited in estimating the covariance matrix. In high dimensional settings, we prove that the sparsity pattern of the discriminant features can be consistently recovered with the parametric rate, and the expected misclassiﬁcation error is consistent to the Bayes risk. Our theory is backed up by careful numerical experiments, which show that the extra ﬂexibility gained by the CODA method incurs little efﬁciency loss even when the data are truly Gaussian. These results suggest that the CODA method can be an alternative choice besides the normal-based high dimensional linear discriminant analysis.

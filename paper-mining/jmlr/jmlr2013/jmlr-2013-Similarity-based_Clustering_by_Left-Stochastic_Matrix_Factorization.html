<p>Author: Wei Pan, Xiaotong Shen, Binghui Liu</p><p>Abstract: Clustering analysis is widely used in many ﬁelds. Traditionally clustering is regarded as unsupervised learning for its lack of a class label or a quantitative response variable, which in contrast is present in supervised learning such as classiﬁcation and regression. Here we formulate clustering as penalized regression with grouping pursuit. In addition to the novel use of a non-convex group penalty and its associated unique operating characteristics in the proposed clustering method, a main advantage of this formulation is its allowing borrowing some well established results in classiﬁcation and regression, such as model selection criteria to select the number of clusters, a difﬁcult problem in clustering analysis. In particular, we propose using the generalized cross-validation (GCV) based on generalized degrees of freedom (GDF) to select the number of clusters. We use a few simple numerical examples to compare our proposed method with some existing approaches, demonstrating our method’s promising performance.

<p>Author: Markus Thom, Günther Palm</p><p>Abstract: Sparseness is a useful regularizer for learning in a wide range of applications, in particular in neural networks. This paper proposes a model targeted at classiﬁcation tasks, where sparse activity and sparse connectivity are used to enhance classiﬁcation capabilities. The tool for achieving this is a sparseness-enforcing projection operator which ﬁnds the closest vector with a pre-deﬁned sparseness for any given vector. In the theoretical part of this paper, a comprehensive theory for such a projection is developed. In conclusion, it is shown that the projection is differentiable almost everywhere and can thus be implemented as a smooth neuronal transfer function. The entire model can hence be tuned end-to-end using gradient-based methods. Experiments on the MNIST database of handwritten digits show that classiﬁcation performance can be boosted by sparse activity or sparse connectivity. With a combination of both, performance can be signiﬁcantly better compared to classical non-sparse approaches.

<p>Author: Eva L. Dyer, Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan, Richard G. Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: Unions of subspaces provide a powerful generalization of single subspace models for collections of high-dimensional data; however, learning multiple subspaces from data is challenging due to the fact that segmentation—the identiﬁcation of points that live in the same subspace—and subspace estimation must be performed simultaneously. Recently, sparse recovery methods were shown to provide a provable and robust strategy for exact feature selection (EFS)—recovering subsets of points from the ensemble that live in the same subspace. In parallel with recent studies of EFS with ℓ1 -minimization, in this paper, we develop sufﬁcient conditions for EFS with a greedy method for sparse signal recovery known as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). Following our analysis, we provide an empirical study of feature selection strategies for signals living on unions of subspaces and characterize the gap between sparse recovery methods and nearest neighbor (NN)-based approaches. In particular, we demonstrate that sparse recovery methods provide signiﬁcant advantages over NN methods and that the gap between the two approaches is particularly pronounced when the sampling of subspaces in the data set is sparse. Our results suggest that OMP may be employed to reliably recover exact feature sets in a number of regimes where NN approaches fail to reveal the subspace membership of points in the ensemble.

Hoffman, Jianhua Xuan, Yue Wang</p><p>Abstract: We describe a R-Java CAM (convex analysis of mixtures) package that provides comprehensive analytic functions and a graphic user interface (GUI) for blindly separating mixed nonnegative sources. This open-source multiplatform software implements recent and classic algorithms in the literature including Chan et al. (2008), Wang et al. (2010), Chen et al. (2011a) and Chen et al. (2011b). The CAM package offers several attractive features: (1) instead of using proprietary MATLAB, its analytic functions are written in R, which makes the codes more portable and easier to modify; (2) besides producing and plotting results in R, it also provides a Java GUI for automatic progress update and convenient visual monitoring; (3) multi-thread interactions between the R and Java modules are driven and integrated by a Java GUI, assuring that the whole CAM software runs responsively; (4) the package offers a simple mechanism to allow others to plug-in additional R-functions.

Overview Blind source separation (BSS) has proven to be a powerful and widely-applicable tool for the analysis and interpretation of composite patterns in engineering and science (Hillman and Moore, 2007; Lee and Seung, 1999). BSS is often described by a linear latent variable model X = AS, where X is the observation data matrix, A is the unknown mixing matrix, and S is the unknown source data matrix. The fundamental objective of BSS is to estimate both the unknown but informative mixing proportions and the source signals based only on the observed mixtures (Child, 2006; Cruces-Alvarez et al., 2004; Hyvarinen et al., 2001; Keshava and Mustard, 2002). While many existing BSS algorithms can usefully extract interesting patterns from mixture observations, they often prove inaccurate or even incorrect in the face of real-world BSS problems in which the pre-imposed assumptions may be invalid. There is a family of approaches exploiting the source non-negativity, including the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (Gillis, 2012; Lee and Seung, 1999). This motivates the development of alternative BSS techniques involving exploitation of source nonnegative nature (Chan et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2011a,b; Wang et al., 2010). The method works by performing convex analysis of mixtures (CAM) that automatically identiﬁes pure-source signals that reside at the vertices of the multifaceted simplex most tightly enclosing the data scatter, enabling geometrically-principled delineation of distinct source patterns from mixtures, with the number of underlying sources being suggested by the minimum description length criterion. Consider a latent variable model x(i) = As(i), where the observation vector x(i) = [x1 (i), ..., xM (i)]T can be expressed as a non-negative linear combination of the source vectors s(i) = [s1 (i), ..., sJ (i)]T , and A = [a1 , ..., aJ ] is the mixing matrix with a j being the jth column vector. This falls neatly within the deﬁnition of a convex set (Fig. 1) (Chen et al., 2011a): X= J J ∑ j=1 s j (i)a j |a j ∈ A, s j (i) ≥ 0, ∑ j=1 s j (i) = 1, i = 1, ..., N . Assume that the sources have at least one sample point whose signal is exclusively enriched in a particular source (Wang et al., 2010), we have shown that the vertex points of the observation simplex (Fig. 1) correspond to the column vectors of the mixing matrix (Chen et al., 2011b). Via a minimum-error-margin volume maximization, CAM identiﬁes the optimum set of the vertices (Chen et al., 2011b; Wang et al., 2010). Using the samples attached to the vertices, compartment modeling (CM) (Chen et al., 2011a) obtains a parametric solution of A, nonnegative independent component analysis (nICA) (Oja and Plumbley, 2004) estimates A (and s) that maximizes the independency in s, and nonnegative well-grounded component analysis (nWCA) (Wang et al., 2010) ﬁnds the column vectors of A directly from the vertex cluster centers. Figure 1: Schematic and illustrative ﬂowchart of R-Java CAM package. 2900 T HE CAM S OFTWARE IN R-JAVA In this paper we describe a newly developed R-Java CAM package whose analytic functions are written in R, while a graphic user interface (GUI) is implemented in Java, taking full advantages of both programming languages. The core software suite implements CAM functions and includes normalization, clustering, and data visualization. Multi-thread interactions between the R and Java modules are driven and integrated by a Java GUI, which not only provides convenient data or parameter passing and visual progress monitoring but also assures the responsive execution of the entire CAM software. 2. Software Design and Implementation The CAM package mainly consists of R and Java modules. The R module is a collection of main and helper functions, each represented by an R function object and achieving an independent and speciﬁc task (Fig. 1). The R module mainly performs various analytic tasks required by CAM: ﬁgure plotting, update, or error message generation. The Java module is developed to provide a GUI (Fig. 2). We adopt the model-view-controller (MVC) design strategy, and use different Java classes to separately perform information visualization and human-computer interaction. The Java module also serves as the software driver and integrator that use a multi-thread strategy to facilitate the interactions between the R and Java modules, such as importing raw data, passing algorithmic parameters, calling R scripts, and transporting results and messages. Figure 2: Interactive Java GUI supported by a multi-thread design strategy. 2.1 Analytic and Presentation Tasks Implemented in R The R module performs the CAM algorithm and facilitates a suite of subsequent analyses including CM, nICA, and nWCA. These tasks are performed by the three main functions: CAM-CM.R, CAM-nICA.R, and CAM-nWCA.R, which can be activated by the three R scripts: Java-runCAM-CM.R, Java-runCAM-ICA.R, and Java-runCAM-nWCA.R. The R module also performs auxiliary tasks including automatic R library installation, ﬁgure drawing, and result recording; and offers other standard methods such as nonnegative matrix factorization (Lee and Seung, 1999), Fast ICA (Hyvarinen et al., 2001), factor analysis (Child, 2006), principal component analysis, afﬁnity propagation, k-means clustering, and expectation-maximization algorithm for learning standard ﬁnite normal mixture model. 2.2 Graphic User Interface Written in Java Swing The Java GUI module allows users to import data, select algorithms and parameters, and display results. The module encloses two packages: guiView contains classes for handling frames and 2901 WANG , M ENG , C HEN , M ADHAVAN , C LARKE , H OFFMAN , X UAN AND WANG Figure 3: Application of R-Java CAM to deconvolving dynamic medical image sequence. dialogs for managing user inputs; guiModel contains classes for representing result data sets and for interacting with the R script caller. Packaged as one jar ﬁle, the GUI module runs automatically. 2.3 Functional Interaction Between R and Java We adopt the open-source program RCaller (http://code.google.com/p/rcaller) to implement the interaction between R and Java modules (Fig. 2), supported by explicitly designed R scripts such as Java-runCAM-CM.R. Speciﬁcally, ﬁve featured Java classes are introduced to interact with R for importing data or parameters, running algorithms, passing on or recording results, displaying ﬁgures, and handing over error messages. The examples of these classes include guiModel.MyRCaller.java, guiModel.MyRCaller.readResults(), and guiView.MyRPlotViewer. 3. Case Studies and Experimental Results The CAM package has been successfully applied to various data types. Using dynamic contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging data set of an advanced breast cancer case (Chen, et al., 2011b),“double click” (or command lines under Ubuntu) activated execution of CAM-Java.jar reveals two biologically interpretable vascular compartments with distinct kinetic patterns: fast clearance in the peripheral “rim” and slow clearance in the inner “core”. These outcomes are consistent with previously reported intratumor heterogeneity (Fig. 3). Angiogenesis is essential to tumor development beyond 1-2mm3 . It has been widely observed that active angiogenesis is often observed in advanced breast tumors occurring in the peripheral “rim” with co-occurrence of inner-core hypoxia. This pattern is largely due to the defective endothelial barrier function and outgrowth blood supply. In another application to natural image mixtures, CAM algorithm successfully recovered the source images in a large number of trials (see Users Manual). 4.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko, Jérémie Mary</p><p>Abstract: A metric between time-series distributions is proposed that can be evaluated using binary classiﬁcation methods, which were originally developed to work on i.i.d. data. It is shown how this metric can be used for solving statistical problems that are seemingly unrelated to classiﬁcation and concern highly dependent time series. Speciﬁcally, the problems of time-series clustering, homogeneity testing and the three-sample problem are addressed. Universal consistency of the resulting algorithms is proven under most general assumptions. The theoretical results are illustrated with experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

<p>Author: Raman Arora, Maya R. Gupta, Amol Kapila, Maryam Fazel</p><p>Abstract: For similarity-based clustering, we propose modeling the entries of a given similarity matrix as the inner products of the unknown cluster probabilities. To estimate the cluster probabilities from the given similarity matrix, we introduce a left-stochastic non-negative matrix factorization problem. A rotation-based algorithm is proposed for the matrix factorization. Conditions for unique matrix factorizations and clusterings are given, and an error bound is provided. The algorithm is particularly efﬁcient for the case of two clusters, which motivates a hierarchical variant for cases where the number of desired clusters is large. Experiments show that the proposed left-stochastic decomposition clustering model produces relatively high within-cluster similarity on most data sets and can match given class labels, and that the efﬁcient hierarchical variant performs surprisingly well.

<p>Author: Ming-Jie Zhao, Narayanan Edakunni, Adam Pocock, Gavin Brown</p><p>Abstract: Fano’s inequality lower bounds the probability of transmission error through a communication channel. Applied to classiﬁcation problems, it provides a lower bound on the Bayes error rate and motivates the widely used Infomax principle. In modern machine learning, we are often interested in more than just the error rate. In medical diagnosis, different errors incur different cost; hence, the overall risk is cost-sensitive. Two other popular criteria are balanced error rate (BER) and F-score. In this work, we focus on the two-class problem and use a general deﬁnition of conditional entropy (including Shannon’s as a special case) to derive upper/lower bounds on the optimal F-score, BER and cost-sensitive risk, extending Fano’s result. As a consequence, we show that Infomax is not suitable for optimizing F-score or cost-sensitive risk, in that it can potentially lead to low F-score and high risk. For cost-sensitive risk, we propose a new conditional entropy formulation which avoids this inconsistency. In addition, we consider the common practice of using a threshold on the posterior probability to tune performance of a classiﬁer. As is widely known, a threshold of 0.5, where the posteriors cross, minimizes error rate—we derive similar optimal thresholds for F-score and BER.

<p>Author: Yuchen Zhang, John C. Duchi, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We analyze two communication-efﬁcient algorithms for distributed optimization in statistical settings involving large-scale data sets. The ﬁrst algorithm is a standard averaging method that distributes the N data samples evenly to m machines, performs separate minimization on each subset, and then averages the estimates. We provide a sharp analysis of this average mixture algorithm, showing that under a reasonable set of conditions, the combined parameter achieves √ mean-squared error (MSE) that decays as O (N −1 + (N/m)−2 ). Whenever m ≤ N, this guarantee matches the best possible rate achievable by a centralized algorithm having access to all N samples. The second algorithm is a novel method, based on an appropriate form of bootstrap subsampling. Requiring only a single round of communication, it has mean-squared error that decays as O (N −1 + (N/m)−3 ), and so is more robust to the amount of parallelization. In addition, we show that a stochastic gradient-based method attains mean-squared error decaying as O (N −1 + (N/m)−3/2 ), easing computation at the expense of a potentially slower MSE rate. We also provide an experimental evaluation of our methods, investigating their performance both on simulated data and on a large-scale regression problem from the internet search domain. In particular, we show that our methods can be used to efﬁciently solve an advertisement prediction problem from the Chinese SoSo Search Engine, which involves logistic regression with N ≈ 2.4 × 108 samples and d ≈ 740,000 covariates.

<p>Author: Gang Niu, Bo Dai, Lin Shang, Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: The large volume principle proposed by Vladimir Vapnik, which advocates that hypotheses lying in an equivalence class with a larger volume are more preferable, is a useful alternative to the large margin principle. In this paper, we introduce a new discriminative clustering model based on the large volume principle called maximum volume clustering (MVC), and then propose two approximation schemes to solve this MVC model: A soft-label MVC method using sequential quadratic programming and a hard-label MVC method using semi-deﬁnite programming, respectively. The proposed MVC is theoretically advantageous for three reasons. The optimization involved in hardlabel MVC is convex, and under mild conditions, the optimization involved in soft-label MVC is akin to a convex one in terms of the resulting clusters. Secondly, the soft-label MVC method pos∗. A preliminary and shorter version has appeared in Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Statistics (Niu et al., 2011). The preliminary work was done when GN was studying at Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, and BD was studying at Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. A Matlab implementation of maximum volume clustering is available from http://sugiyama-www.cs.titech.ac.jp/∼gang/software.html. c 2013 Gang Niu, Bo Dai, Lin Shang and Masashi Sugiyama. N IU , DAI , S HANG AND S UGIYAMA sesses a clustering error bound. Thirdly, MVC includes the optimization problems of a spectral clustering, two relaxed k-means clustering and an information-maximization clustering as special limit cases when its regularization parameter goes to inﬁnity. Experiments on several artiﬁcial and benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed MVC compares favorably with state-of-the-art clustering methods.

<p>Author: Wei Sun, Junhui Wang, Yixin Fang</p><p>Abstract: Penalized regression models are popularly used in high-dimensional data analysis to conduct variable selection and model ﬁtting simultaneously. Whereas success has been widely reported in literature, their performances largely depend on the tuning parameters that balance the trade-off between model ﬁtting and model sparsity. Existing tuning criteria mainly follow the route of minimizing the estimated prediction error or maximizing the posterior model probability, such as cross validation, AIC and BIC. This article introduces a general tuning parameter selection criterion based on variable selection stability. The key idea is to select the tuning parameters so that the resultant penalized regression model is stable in variable selection. The asymptotic selection consistency is established for both ﬁxed and diverging dimensions. Its effectiveness is also demonstrated in a variety of simulated examples as well as an application to the prostate cancer data.

In this paper, we introduce a new discriminative clustering model based on the large volume principle called maximum volume clustering (MVC), and then propose two approximation schemes to solve this MVC model: A soft-label MVC method using sequential quadratic programming and a hard-label MVC method using semi-deﬁnite programming, respectively. The proposed MVC is theoretically advantageous for three reasons. The optimization involved in hardlabel MVC is convex, and under mild conditions, the optimization involved in soft-label MVC is akin to a convex one in terms of the resulting clusters. Secondly, the soft-label MVC method pos∗. A preliminary and shorter version has appeared in Proceedings of 14th International Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Statistics (Niu et al., 2011).

<p>Author: Lauren A. Hannah, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new, nonparametric method for multivariate regression subject to convexity or concavity constraints on the response function. Convexity constraints are common in economics, statistics, operations research, ﬁnancial engineering and optimization, but there is currently no multivariate method that is stable and computationally feasible for more than a few thousand observations. We introduce convex adaptive partitioning (CAP), which creates a globally convex regression model from locally linear estimates ﬁt on adaptively selected covariate partitions. CAP is a computationally efﬁcient, consistent method for convex regression. We demonstrate empirical performance by comparing the performance of CAP to other shape-constrained and unconstrained regression methods for predicting weekly wages and value function approximation for pricing American basket options.

<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: We consider supervised learning problems where the features are embedded in a graph, such as gene expressions in a gene network. In this context, it is of much interest to automatically select a subgraph with few connected components; by exploiting prior knowledge, one can indeed improve the prediction performance or obtain results that are easier to interpret. Regularization or penalty functions for selecting features in graphs have recently been proposed, but they raise new algorithmic challenges. For example, they typically require solving a combinatorially hard selection problem among all connected subgraphs. In this paper, we propose computationally feasible strategies to select a sparse and well-connected subset of features sitting on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We introduce structured sparsity penalties over paths on a DAG called “path coding” penalties. Unlike existing regularization functions that model long-range interactions between features in a graph, path coding penalties are tractable. The penalties and their proximal operators involve path selection problems, which we efﬁciently solve by leveraging network ﬂow optimization. We experimentally show on synthetic, image, and genomic data that our approach is scalable and leads to more connected subgraphs than other regularization functions for graphs.

<p>Author: Raman Arora, Maya R. Gupta, Amol Kapila, Maryam Fazel</p><p>Abstract: For similarity-based clustering, we propose modeling the entries of a given similarity matrix as the inner products of the unknown cluster probabilities. To estimate the cluster probabilities from the given similarity matrix, we introduce a left-stochastic non-negative matrix factorization problem. A rotation-based algorithm is proposed for the matrix factorization. Conditions for unique matrix factorizations and clusterings are given, and an error bound is provided. The algorithm is particularly efﬁcient for the case of two clusters, which motivates a hierarchical variant for cases where the number of desired clusters is large. Experiments show that the proposed left-stochastic decomposition clustering model produces relatively high within-cluster similarity on most data sets and can match given class labels, and that the efﬁcient hierarchical variant performs surprisingly well.

<p>Author: Wei Pan, Xiaotong Shen, Binghui Liu</p><p>Abstract: Clustering analysis is widely used in many ﬁelds. Traditionally clustering is regarded as unsupervised learning for its lack of a class label or a quantitative response variable, which in contrast is present in supervised learning such as classiﬁcation and regression. Here we formulate clustering as penalized regression with grouping pursuit. In addition to the novel use of a non-convex group penalty and its associated unique operating characteristics in the proposed clustering method, a main advantage of this formulation is its allowing borrowing some well established results in classiﬁcation and regression, such as model selection criteria to select the number of clusters, a difﬁcult problem in clustering analysis. In particular, we propose using the generalized cross-validation (GCV) based on generalized degrees of freedom (GDF) to select the number of clusters. We use a few simple numerical examples to compare our proposed method with some existing approaches, demonstrating our method’s promising performance.

<p>Author: Wei Sun, Junhui Wang, Yixin Fang</p><p>Abstract: Penalized regression models are popularly used in high-dimensional data analysis to conduct variable selection and model ﬁtting simultaneously. Whereas success has been widely reported in literature, their performances largely depend on the tuning parameters that balance the trade-off between model ﬁtting and model sparsity. Existing tuning criteria mainly follow the route of minimizing the estimated prediction error or maximizing the posterior model probability, such as cross validation, AIC and BIC. This article introduces a general tuning parameter selection criterion based on variable selection stability. The key idea is to select the tuning parameters so that the resultant penalized regression model is stable in variable selection. The asymptotic selection consistency is established for both ﬁxed and diverging dimensions. Its effectiveness is also demonstrated in a variety of simulated examples as well as an application to the prostate cancer data.

<p>Author: Lorenzo Rosasco, Silvia Villa, Sofia Mosci, Matteo Santoro, Alessandro Verri</p><p>Abstract: In this work we are interested in the problems of supervised learning and variable selection when the input-output dependence is described by a nonlinear function depending on a few variables. Our goal is to consider a sparse nonparametric model, hence avoiding linear or additive models. The key idea is to measure the importance of each variable in the model by making use of partial derivatives. Based on this intuition we propose a new notion of nonparametric sparsity and a corresponding least squares regularization scheme. Using concepts and results from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and proximal methods, we show that the proposed learning algorithm corresponds to a minimization problem which can be provably solved by an iterative procedure. The consistency properties of the obtained estimator are studied both in terms of prediction and selection performance. An extensive empirical analysis shows that the proposed method performs favorably with respect to the state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Author: Chong Zhang, Yufeng Liu</p><p>Abstract: Hard and soft classiﬁers are two important groups of techniques for classiﬁcation problems. Logistic regression and Support Vector Machines are typical examples of soft and hard classiﬁers respectively. The essential difference between these two groups is whether one needs to estimate the class conditional probability for the classiﬁcation task or not. In particular, soft classiﬁers predict the label based on the obtained class conditional probabilities, while hard classiﬁers bypass the estimation of probabilities and focus on the decision boundary. In practice, for the goal of accurate classiﬁcation, it is unclear which one to use in a given situation. To tackle this problem, the Largemargin Uniﬁed Machine (LUM) was recently proposed as a uniﬁed family to embrace both groups. The LUM family enables one to study the behavior change from soft to hard binary classiﬁers. For multicategory cases, however, the concept of soft and hard classiﬁcation becomes less clear. In that case, class probability estimation becomes more involved as it requires estimation of a probability vector. In this paper, we propose a new Multicategory LUM (MLUM) framework to investigate the behavior of soft versus hard classiﬁcation under multicategory settings. Our theoretical and numerical results help to shed some light on the nature of multicategory classiﬁcation and its transition behavior from soft to hard classiﬁers. The numerical results suggest that the proposed tuned MLUM yields very competitive performance.

<p>Author: Nemanja Djuric, Liang Lan, Slobodan Vucetic, Zhuang Wang</p><p>Abstract: We present BudgetedSVM, an open-source C++ toolbox comprising highly-optimized implementations of recently proposed algorithms for scalable training of Support Vector Machine (SVM) approximators: Adaptive Multi-hyperplane Machines, Low-rank Linearization SVM, and Budgeted Stochastic Gradient Descent. BudgetedSVM trains models with accuracy comparable to LibSVM in time comparable to LibLinear, solving non-linear problems with millions of high-dimensional examples within minutes on a regular computer. We provide command-line and Matlab interfaces to BudgetedSVM, an efﬁcient API for handling large-scale, high-dimensional data sets, as well as detailed documentation to help developers use and further extend the toolbox.

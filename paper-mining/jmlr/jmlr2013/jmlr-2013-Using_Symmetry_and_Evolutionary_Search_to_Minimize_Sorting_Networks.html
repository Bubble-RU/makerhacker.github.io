<p>Author: Karthik H. Shankar, Marc W. Howard</p><p>Abstract: Any learner with the ability to predict the future of a structured time-varying signal must maintain a memory of the recent past. If the signal has a characteristic timescale relevant to future prediction, the memory can be a simple shift register—a moving window extending into the past, requiring storage resources that linearly grows with the timescale to be represented. However, an independent general purpose learner cannot a priori know the characteristic prediction-relevant timescale of the signal. Moreover, many naturally occurring signals show scale-free long range correlations implying that the natural prediction-relevant timescale is essentially unbounded. Hence the learner should maintain information from the longest possible timescale allowed by resource availability. Here we construct a fuzzy memory system that optimally sacriﬁces the temporal accuracy of information in a scale-free fashion in order to represent prediction-relevant information from exponentially long timescales. Using several illustrative examples, we demonstrate the advantage of the fuzzy memory system over a shift register in time series forecasting of natural signals. When the available storage resources are limited, we suggest that a general purpose learner would be better off committing to such a fuzzy memory system.

<p>Author: Pekka Parviainen, Mikko Koivisto</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of ﬁnding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that optimizes a decomposable Bayesian network score. While in a favorable case an optimal DAG can be found in polynomial time, in the worst case the fastest known algorithms rely on dynamic programming across the node subsets, taking time and space 2n , to within a factor polynomial in the number of nodes n. In practice, these algorithms are feasible to networks of at most around 30 nodes, mainly due to the large space requirement. Here, we generalize the dynamic programming approach to enhance its feasibility in three dimensions: ﬁrst, the user may trade space against time; second, the proposed algorithms easily and efﬁciently parallelize onto thousands of processors; third, the algorithms can exploit any prior knowledge about the precedence relation on the nodes. Underlying all these results is the key observation that, given a partial order P on the nodes, an optimal DAG compatible with P can be found in time and space roughly proportional to the number of ideals of P , which can be signiﬁcantly less than 2n . Considering sufﬁciently many carefully chosen partial orders guarantees that a globally optimal DAG will be found. Aside from the generic scheme, we present and analyze concrete tradeoff schemes based on parallel bucket orders.

<p>Author: Yuejia He, Yiyuan She, Dapeng Wu</p><p>Abstract: Recently, researchers have proposed penalized maximum likelihood to identify network topology underlying a dynamical system modeled by multivariate time series. The time series of interest are assumed to be stationary, but this restriction is never taken into consideration by existing estimation methods. Moreover, practical problems of interest may have ultra-high dimensionality and obvious node collinearity. In addition, none of the available algorithms provides a probabilistic measure of the uncertainty for the obtained network topology which is informative in reliable network identiﬁcation. The main purpose of this paper is to tackle these challenging issues. We propose the S2 learning framework, which stands for stationary-sparse network learning. We propose a novel algorithm referred to as the Berhu iterative sparsity pursuit with stationarity (BISPS), where the Berhu regularization can improve the Lasso in detection and estimation. The algorithm is extremely easy to implement, efﬁcient in computation and has a theoretical guarantee to converge to a global optimum. We also incorporate a screening technique into BISPS to tackle ultra-high dimensional problems and enhance computational efﬁciency. Furthermore, a stationary bootstrap technique is applied to provide connection occurring frequency for reliable topology learning. Experiments show that our method can achieve stationary and sparse causality network learning and is scalable for high-dimensional problems.

<p>Author: Nicholas Ruozzi, Sekhar Tatikonda</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) is an iterative algorithm for computing the mean (and variances) of a multivariate Gaussian distribution, or equivalently, the minimum of a multivariate positive deﬁnite quadratic function. Sufﬁcient conditions, such as walk-summability, that guarantee the convergence and correctness of GaBP are known, but GaBP may fail to converge to the correct solution given an arbitrary positive deﬁnite covariance matrix. As was observed by Malioutov et al. (2006), the GaBP algorithm fails to converge if the computation trees produced by the algorithm are not positive deﬁnite. In this work, we will show that the failure modes of the GaBP algorithm can be understood via graph covers, and we prove that a parameterized generalization of the min-sum algorithm can be used to ensure that the computation trees remain positive deﬁnite whenever the input matrix is positive deﬁnite. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm is closely related to other iterative schemes for quadratic minimization such as the Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi algorithms. Finally, we observe, empirically, that there always exists a choice of parameters such that the above generalization of the GaBP algorithm converges.

<p>Author: Markus Thom, Günther Palm</p><p>Abstract: Sparseness is a useful regularizer for learning in a wide range of applications, in particular in neural networks. This paper proposes a model targeted at classiﬁcation tasks, where sparse activity and sparse connectivity are used to enhance classiﬁcation capabilities. The tool for achieving this is a sparseness-enforcing projection operator which ﬁnds the closest vector with a pre-deﬁned sparseness for any given vector. In the theoretical part of this paper, a comprehensive theory for such a projection is developed. In conclusion, it is shown that the projection is differentiable almost everywhere and can thus be implemented as a smooth neuronal transfer function. The entire model can hence be tuned end-to-end using gradient-based methods. Experiments on the MNIST database of handwritten digits show that classiﬁcation performance can be boosted by sparse activity or sparse connectivity. With a combination of both, performance can be signiﬁcantly better compared to classical non-sparse approaches.

Valsalam, Risto Miikkulainen</p><p>Abstract: Sorting networks are an interesting class of parallel sorting algorithms with applications in multiprocessor computers and switching networks. They are built by cascading a series of comparisonexchange units called comparators. Minimizing the number of comparators for a given number of inputs is a challenging optimization problem. This paper presents a two-pronged approach called Symmetry and Evolution based Network Sort Optimization (SENSO) that makes it possible to scale the solutions to networks with a larger number of inputs than previously possible. First, it uses the symmetry of the problem to decompose the minimization goal into subgoals that are easier to solve. Second, it minimizes the resulting greedy solutions further by using an evolutionary algorithm to learn the statistical distribution of comparators in minimal networks. The ﬁnal solutions improve upon half-century of results published in patents, books, and peer-reviewed literature, demonstrating the potential of the SENSO approach for solving difﬁcult combinatorial problems.

<p>Author: Chao Zhang, Dacheng Tao</p><p>Abstract: L´ vy processes refer to a class of stochastic processes, for example, Poisson processes and Browe nian motions, and play an important role in stochastic processes and machine learning. Therefore, it is essential to study risk bounds of the learning process for time-dependent samples drawn from a L´ vy process (or brieﬂy called learning process for L´ vy process). It is noteworthy that samples e e in this learning process are not independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Therefore, results in traditional statistical learning theory are not applicable (or at least cannot be applied directly), because they are obtained under the sample-i.i.d. assumption. In this paper, we study risk bounds of the learning process for time-dependent samples drawn from a L´ vy process, and then analyze the e asymptotical behavior of the learning process. In particular, we ﬁrst develop the deviation inequalities and the symmetrization inequality for the learning process. By using the resultant inequalities, we then obtain the risk bounds based on the covering number. Finally, based on the resulting risk bounds, we study the asymptotic convergence and the rate of convergence of the learning process for L´ vy process. Meanwhile, we also give a comparison to the related results under the samplee i.i.d. assumption.

<p>Author: Dan Stowell, Mark D. Plumbley</p><p>Abstract: We describe an inference task in which a set of timestamped event observations must be clustered into an unknown number of temporal sequences with independent and varying rates of observations. Various existing approaches to multi-object tracking assume a ﬁxed number of sources and/or a ﬁxed observation rate; we develop an approach to inferring structure in timestamped data produced by a mixture of an unknown and varying number of similar Markov renewal processes, plus independent clutter noise. The inference simultaneously distinguishes signal from noise as well as clustering signal observations into separate source streams. We illustrate the technique via synthetic experiments as well as an experiment to track a mixture of singing birds. Source code is available.

<p>Author: Xiao-Tong Yuan, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the sparse eigenvalue problem, which is to extract dominant (largest) sparse eigenvectors with at most k non-zero components. We propose a simple yet effective solution called truncated power method that can approximately solve the underlying nonconvex optimization problem. A strong sparse recovery result is proved for the truncated power method, and this theory is our key motivation for developing the new algorithm. The proposed method is tested on applications such as sparse principal component analysis and the densest k-subgraph problem. Extensive experiments on several synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the competitive empirical performance of our method.

<p>Author: Rami Mahdi, Jason Mezey</p><p>Abstract: Constraint-based learning of Bayesian networks (BN) from limited data can lead to multiple testing problems when recovering dense areas of the skeleton and to conﬂicting results in the orientation of edges. In this paper, we present a new constraint-based algorithm, light mutual min (LMM) for improved accuracy of BN learning from small sample data. LMM improves the assessment of candidate edges by using a ranking criterion that considers conditional independence on neighboring variables at both sides of an edge simultaneously. The algorithm also employs an adaptive relaxation of constraints that, selectively, allows some nodes not to condition on some neighbors. This relaxation aims at reducing the incorrect rejection of true edges connecting high degree nodes due to multiple testing. LMM additionally incorporates a new criterion for ranking v-structures that is used to recover the completed partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG) and to resolve conﬂicting v-structures, a common problem in small sample constraint-based learning. Using simulated data, each of these components of LMM is shown to signiﬁcantly improve network inference compared to commonly applied methods when learning from limited data, including more accurate recovery of skeletons and CPDAGs compared to the PC, MaxMin, and MaxMin hill climbing algorithms. A proof of asymptotic correctness is also provided for LMM for recovering the correct skeleton and CPDAG.

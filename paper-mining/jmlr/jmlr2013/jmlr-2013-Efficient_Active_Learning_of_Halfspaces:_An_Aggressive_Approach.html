<p>Author: Philip M. Long, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning an unknown large-margin halfspace in the context of parallel computation, giving both positive and negative results. As our main positive result, we give a parallel algorithm for learning a large-margin halfspace, based on an algorithm of Nesterov’s that performs gradient descent with a momentum term. We show that this algorithm can learn an unknown γ-margin halfspace over n dimensions using ˜ n · poly(1/γ) processors and running in time O(1/γ) + O(log n). In contrast, naive parallel algorithms that learn a γ-margin halfspace in time that depends polylogarithmically on n have an inverse quadratic running time dependence on the margin parameter γ. Our negative result deals with boosting, which is a standard approach to learning large-margin halfspaces. We prove that in the original PAC framework, in which a weak learning algorithm is provided as an oracle that is called by the booster, boosting cannot be parallelized. More precisely, we show that, if the algorithm is allowed to call the weak learner multiple times in parallel within a single boosting stage, this ability does not reduce the overall number of successive stages of boosting needed for learning by even a single stage. Our proof is information-theoretic and does not rely on unproven assumptions.

<p>Author: Sivan Sabato, Nathan Srebro, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: We obtain a tight distribution-speciﬁc characterization of the sample complexity of large-margin classiﬁcation with L2 regularization: We introduce the margin-adapted dimension, which is a simple function of the second order statistics of the data distribution, and show distribution-speciﬁc upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity, both governed by the margin-adapted dimension of the data distribution. The upper bounds are universal, and the lower bounds hold for the rich family of sub-Gaussian distributions with independent features. We conclude that this new quantity tightly characterizes the true sample complexity of large-margin classiﬁcation. To prove the lower bound, we develop several new tools of independent interest. These include new connections between shattering and hardness of learning, new properties of shattering with linear classiﬁers, and a new lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue of a random Gram matrix generated by sub-Gaussian variables. Our results can be used to quantitatively compare large margin learning to other learning rules, and to improve the effectiveness of methods that use sample complexity bounds, such as active learning.

<p>Author: Jun Wang, Tony Jebara, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods play an increasingly important role in practical machine learning systems, particularly in agnostic settings when no parametric information or other prior knowledge is available about the data distribution. Given the constructed graph represented by a weight matrix, transductive inference is used to propagate known labels to predict the values of all unlabeled vertices. Designing a robust label diffusion algorithm for such graphs is a widely studied problem and various methods have recently been suggested. Many of these can be formalized as regularized function estimation through the minimization of a quadratic cost. However, most existing label diffusion methods minimize a univariate cost with the classiﬁcation function as the only variable of interest. Since the observed labels seed the diffusion process, such univariate frameworks are extremely sensitive to the initial label choice and any label noise. To alleviate the dependency on the initial observed labels, this article proposes a bivariate formulation for graph-based SSL, where both the binary label information and a continuous classiﬁcation function are arguments of the optimization. This bivariate formulation is shown to be equivalent to a linearly constrained Max-Cut problem. Finally an efﬁcient solution via greedy gradient Max-Cut (GGMC) is derived which gradually assigns unlabeled vertices to each class with minimum connectivity. Once convergence guarantees are established, this greedy Max-Cut based SSL is applied on both artiﬁcial and standard benchmark data sets where it obtains superior classiﬁcation accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art SSL methods. Moreover, GGMC shows robustness with respect to the graph construction method and maintains high accuracy over extensive experiments with various edge linking and weighting schemes.

<p>Author: Wei Wu, Zhengdong  Lu, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: The task of matching data from two heterogeneous domains naturally arises in various areas such as web search, collaborative ﬁltering, and drug design. In web search, existing work has designed relevance models to match queries and documents by exploiting either user clicks or content of queries and documents. To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been little work on principled approaches to leveraging both clicks and content to learn a matching model for search. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning to match heterogeneous objects. The framework learns two linear mappings for two objects respectively, and matches them via the dot product of their images after mapping. Moreover, when different regularizations are enforced, the framework renders a rich family of matching models. With orthonormal constraints on mapping functions, the framework subsumes Partial Least Squares (PLS) as a special case. Alternatively, with a ℓ1 +ℓ2 regularization, we obtain a new model called Regularized Mapping to Latent Structures (RMLS). RMLS enjoys many advantages over PLS, including lower time complexity and easy parallelization. To further understand the matching framework, we conduct generalization analysis and apply the result to both PLS and RMLS. We apply the framework to web search and implement both PLS and RMLS using a click-through bipartite with metadata representing features of queries and documents. We test the efﬁcacy and scalability of RMLS and PLS on large scale web search problems. The results show that both PLS and RMLS can signiﬁcantly outperform baseline methods, while RMLS substantially speeds up the learning process.

<p>Author: Alon Gonen, Sivan Sabato, Shai Shalev-Shwartz</p><p>Abstract: We study pool-based active learning of half-spaces. We revisit the aggressive approach for active learning in the realizable case, and show that it can be made efﬁcient and practical, while also having theoretical guarantees under reasonable assumptions. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that it can be preferable to mellow approaches. Our efﬁcient aggressive active learner of half-spaces has formal approximation guarantees that hold when the pool is separable with a margin. While our analysis is focused on the realizable setting, we show that a simple heuristic allows using the same algorithm successfully for pools with low error as well. We further compare the aggressive approach to the mellow approach, and prove that there are cases in which the aggressive approach results in signiﬁcantly better label complexity compared to the mellow approach. We demonstrate experimentally that substantial improvements in label complexity can be achieved using the aggressive approach, for both realizable and low-error settings.

<p>Author: Jaakko Riihimäki, Pasi Jylänki, Aki Vehtari</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers probabilistic multinomial probit classiﬁcation using Gaussian process (GP) priors. Challenges with multiclass GP classiﬁcation are the integration over the non-Gaussian posterior distribution, and the increase of the number of unknown latent variables as the number of target classes grows. Expectation propagation (EP) has proven to be a very accurate method for approximate inference but the existing EP approaches for the multinomial probit GP classiﬁcation rely on numerical quadratures, or independence assumptions between the latent values associated with different classes, to facilitate the computations. In this paper we propose a novel nested EP approach which does not require numerical quadratures, and approximates accurately all betweenclass posterior dependencies of the latent values, but still scales linearly in the number of classes. The predictive accuracy of the nested EP approach is compared to Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximations with various benchmark data sets. In the experiments nested EP was the most consistent method compared to MCMC sampling, but in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy the differences between all the methods were small from a practical point of view.

<p>Author: Alberto N. Escalante-B., Laurenz Wiskott</p><p>Abstract: Supervised learning from high-dimensional data, for example, multimedia data, is a challenging task. We propose an extension of slow feature analysis (SFA) for supervised dimensionality reduction called graph-based SFA (GSFA). The algorithm extracts a label-predictive low-dimensional set of features that can be post-processed by typical supervised algorithms to generate the ﬁnal label or class estimation. GSFA is trained with a so-called training graph, in which the vertices are the samples and the edges represent similarities of the corresponding labels. A new weighted SFA optimization problem is introduced, generalizing the notion of slowness from sequences of samples to such training graphs. We show that GSFA computes an optimal solution to this problem in the considered function space and propose several types of training graphs. For classiﬁcation, the most straightforward graph yields features equivalent to those of (nonlinear) Fisher discriminant analysis. Emphasis is on regression, where four different graphs were evaluated experimentally with a subproblem of face detection on photographs. The method proposed is promising particularly when linear models are insufﬁcient as well as when feature selection is difﬁcult.

<p>Author: Philip M. Long, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning an unknown large-margin halfspace in the context of parallel computation, giving both positive and negative results. As our main positive result, we give a parallel algorithm for learning a large-margin halfspace, based on an algorithm of Nesterov’s that performs gradient descent with a momentum term. We show that this algorithm can learn an unknown γ-margin halfspace over n dimensions using ˜ n · poly(1/γ) processors and running in time O(1/γ) + O(log n). In contrast, naive parallel algorithms that learn a γ-margin halfspace in time that depends polylogarithmically on n have an inverse quadratic running time dependence on the margin parameter γ. Our negative result deals with boosting, which is a standard approach to learning large-margin halfspaces. We prove that in the original PAC framework, in which a weak learning algorithm is provided as an oracle that is called by the booster, boosting cannot be parallelized. More precisely, we show that, if the algorithm is allowed to call the weak learner multiple times in parallel within a single boosting stage, this ability does not reduce the overall number of successive stages of boosting needed for learning by even a single stage. Our proof is information-theoretic and does not rely on unproven assumptions.

<p>Author: Nima Noorshams, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: The sum-product or belief propagation (BP) algorithm is a widely used message-passing technique for computing approximate marginals in graphical models. We introduce a new technique, called stochastic orthogonal series message-passing (SOSMP), for computing the BP ﬁxed point in models with continuous random variables. It is based on a deterministic approximation of the messages via orthogonal series basis expansion, and a stochastic estimation of the basis coefﬁcients via Monte Carlo techniques and damped updates. We prove that the SOSMP iterates converge to a δ-neighborhood of the unique BP ﬁxed point for any tree-structured graph, and for any graphs with cycles in which the BP updates satisfy a contractivity condition. In addition, we demonstrate how to choose the number of basis coefﬁcients as a function of the desired approximation accuracy δ and smoothness of the compatibility functions. We illustrate our theory with both simulated examples and in application to optical ﬂow estimation.

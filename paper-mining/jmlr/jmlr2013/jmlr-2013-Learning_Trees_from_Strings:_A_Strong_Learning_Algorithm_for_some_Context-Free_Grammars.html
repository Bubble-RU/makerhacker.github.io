<p>Author: Dana Angluin, James Aspnes, Sarah Eisenstat, Aryeh Kontorovich</p><p>Abstract: PAC learning of unrestricted regular languages is long known to be a difﬁcult problem. The class of shufﬂe ideals is a very restricted subclass of regular languages, where the shufﬂe ideal generated by a string u is the collection of all strings containing u as a subsequence. This fundamental language family is of theoretical interest in its own right and provides the building blocks for other important language families. Despite its apparent simplicity, the class of shufﬂe ideals appears quite difﬁcult to learn. In particular, just as for unrestricted regular languages, the class is not properly PAC learnable in polynomial time if RP = NP, and PAC learning the class improperly in polynomial time would imply polynomial time algorithms for certain fundamental problems in cryptography.

<p>Author: Joachim Niehren, Jérôme Champavère, Aurélien Lemay, Rémi Gilleron</p><p>Abstract: Inference algorithms for tree automata that deﬁne node selecting queries in unranked trees rely on tree pruning strategies. These impose additional assumptions on node selection that are needed to compensate for small numbers of annotated examples. Pruning-based heuristics in query learning algorithms for Web information extraction often boost the learning quality and speed up the learning process. We will distinguish the class of regular queries that are stable under a given schemaguided pruning strategy, and show that this class is learnable with polynomial time and data. Our learning algorithm is obtained by adding pruning heuristics to the traditional learning algorithm for tree automata from positive and negative examples. While justiﬁed by a formal learning model, our learning algorithm for stable queries also performs very well in practice of XML information extraction.

<p>Author: Qiang Liu, Alexander Ihler</p><p>Abstract: The marginal maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem, which calculates the mode of the marginal posterior distribution of a subset of variables with the remaining variables marginalized, is an important inference problem in many models, such as those with hidden variables or uncertain parameters. Unfortunately, marginal MAP can be NP-hard even on trees, and has attracted less attention in the literature compared to the joint MAP (maximization) and marginalization problems. We derive a general dual representation for marginal MAP that naturally integrates the marginalization and maximization operations into a joint variational optimization problem, making it possible to easily extend most or all variational-based algorithms to marginal MAP. In particular, we derive a set of “mixed-product” message passing algorithms for marginal MAP, whose form is a hybrid of max-product, sum-product and a novel “argmax-product” message updates. We also derive a class of convergent algorithms based on proximal point methods, including one that transforms the marginal MAP problem into a sequence of standard marginalization problems. Theoretically, we provide guarantees under which our algorithms give globally or locally optimal solutions, and provide novel upper bounds on the optimal objectives. Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms signiﬁcantly outperform the existing approaches, including a state-of-the-art algorithm based on local search methods.

<p>Author: Vinay Jethava, Anders Martinsson, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Devdatt Dubhashi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we establish that the Lov´ sz ϑ function on a graph can be restated as a kernel learning a problem. We introduce the notion of SVM − ϑ graphs, on which Lov´ sz ϑ function can be apa proximated well by a Support vector machine (SVM). We show that Erd¨ s-R´ nyi random G(n, p) o e log4 n np graphs are SVM − ϑ graphs for n ≤ p < 1. Even if we embed a large clique of size Θ 1−p in a G(n, p) graph the resultant graph still remains a SVM − ϑ graph. This immediately suggests an SVM based algorithm for recovering a large planted clique in random graphs. Associated with the ϑ function is the notion of orthogonal labellings. We introduce common orthogonal labellings which extends the idea of orthogonal labellings to multiple graphs. This allows us to propose a Multiple Kernel learning (MKL) based solution which is capable of identifying a large common dense subgraph in multiple graphs. Both in the planted clique case and common subgraph detection problem the proposed solutions beat the state of the art by an order of magnitude.

<p>Author: John Ahlgren, Shiu Yin Yuen</p><p>Abstract: We present NrSample, a framework for program synthesis in inductive logic programming. NrSample uses propositional logic constraints to exclude undesirable candidates from the search. This is achieved by representing constraints as propositional formulae and solving the associated constraint satisfaction problem. We present a variety of such constraints: pruning, input-output, functional (arithmetic), and variable splitting. NrSample is also capable of detecting search space exhaustion, leading to further speedups in clause induction and optimality. We benchmark NrSample against enumeration search (Aleph’s default) and Progol’s A∗ search in the context of program synthesis. The results show that, on large program synthesis problems, NrSample induces between 1 and 1358 times faster than enumeration (236 times faster on average), always with similar or better accuracy. Compared to Progol A∗ , NrSample is 18 times faster on average with similar or better accuracy except for two problems: one in which Progol A∗ substantially sacriﬁced accuracy to induce faster, and one in which Progol A∗ was a clear winner. Functional constraints provide a speedup of up to 53 times (21 times on average) with similar or better accuracy. We also benchmark using a few concept learning (non-program synthesis) problems. The results indicate that without strong constraints, the overhead of solving constraints is not compensated for.

<p>Author: Niya Wang, Fan Meng, Li Chen, Subha Madhavan, Robert Clarke, Eric P. Hoffman, Jianhua Xuan, Yue Wang</p><p>Abstract: We describe a R-Java CAM (convex analysis of mixtures) package that provides comprehensive analytic functions and a graphic user interface (GUI) for blindly separating mixed nonnegative sources. This open-source multiplatform software implements recent and classic algorithms in the literature including Chan et al. (2008), Wang et al. (2010), Chen et al. (2011a) and Chen et al. (2011b). The CAM package offers several attractive features: (1) instead of using proprietary MATLAB, its analytic functions are written in R, which makes the codes more portable and easier to modify; (2) besides producing and plotting results in R, it also provides a Java GUI for automatic progress update and convenient visual monitoring; (3) multi-thread interactions between the R and Java modules are driven and integrated by a Java GUI, assuring that the whole CAM software runs responsively; (4) the package offers a simple mechanism to allow others to plug-in additional R-functions.

Overview Blind source separation (BSS) has proven to be a powerful and widely-applicable tool for the analysis and interpretation of composite patterns in engineering and science (Hillman and Moore, 2007; Lee and Seung, 1999). BSS is often described by a linear latent variable model X = AS, where X is the observation data matrix, A is the unknown mixing matrix, and S is the unknown source data matrix. The fundamental objective of BSS is to estimate both the unknown but informative mixing proportions and the source signals based only on the observed mixtures (Child, 2006; Cruces-Alvarez et al., 2004; Hyvarinen et al., 2001; Keshava and Mustard, 2002). While many existing BSS algorithms can usefully extract interesting patterns from mixture observations, they often prove inaccurate or even incorrect in the face of real-world BSS problems in which the pre-imposed assumptions may be invalid. There is a family of approaches exploiting the source non-negativity, including the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (Gillis, 2012; Lee and Seung, 1999). This motivates the development of alternative BSS techniques involving exploitation of source nonnegative nature (Chan et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2011a,b; Wang et al., 2010). The method works by performing convex analysis of mixtures (CAM) that automatically identiﬁes pure-source signals that reside at the vertices of the multifaceted simplex most tightly enclosing the data scatter, enabling geometrically-principled delineation of distinct source patterns from mixtures, with the number of underlying sources being suggested by the minimum description length criterion. Consider a latent variable model x(i) = As(i), where the observation vector x(i) = [x1 (i), ..., xM (i)]T can be expressed as a non-negative linear combination of the source vectors s(i) = [s1 (i), ..., sJ (i)]T , and A = [a1 , ..., aJ ] is the mixing matrix with a j being the jth column vector. This falls neatly within the deﬁnition of a convex set (Fig. 1) (Chen et al., 2011a): X= J J ∑ j=1 s j (i)a j |a j ∈ A, s j (i) ≥ 0, ∑ j=1 s j (i) = 1, i = 1, ..., N . Assume that the sources have at least one sample point whose signal is exclusively enriched in a particular source (Wang et al., 2010), we have shown that the vertex points of the observation simplex (Fig. 1) correspond to the column vectors of the mixing matrix (Chen et al., 2011b). Via a minimum-error-margin volume maximization, CAM identiﬁes the optimum set of the vertices (Chen et al., 2011b; Wang et al., 2010). Using the samples attached to the vertices, compartment modeling (CM) (Chen et al., 2011a) obtains a parametric solution of A, nonnegative independent component analysis (nICA) (Oja and Plumbley, 2004) estimates A (and s) that maximizes the independency in s, and nonnegative well-grounded component analysis (nWCA) (Wang et al., 2010) ﬁnds the column vectors of A directly from the vertex cluster centers. Figure 1: Schematic and illustrative ﬂowchart of R-Java CAM package. 2900 T HE CAM S OFTWARE IN R-JAVA In this paper we describe a newly developed R-Java CAM package whose analytic functions are written in R, while a graphic user interface (GUI) is implemented in Java, taking full advantages of both programming languages. The core software suite implements CAM functions and includes normalization, clustering, and data visualization. Multi-thread interactions between the R and Java modules are driven and integrated by a Java GUI, which not only provides convenient data or parameter passing and visual progress monitoring but also assures the responsive execution of the entire CAM software. 2. Software Design and Implementation The CAM package mainly consists of R and Java modules. The R module is a collection of main and helper functions, each represented by an R function object and achieving an independent and speciﬁc task (Fig. 1). The R module mainly performs various analytic tasks required by CAM: ﬁgure plotting, update, or error message generation. The Java module is developed to provide a GUI (Fig. 2). We adopt the model-view-controller (MVC) design strategy, and use different Java classes to separately perform information visualization and human-computer interaction. The Java module also serves as the software driver and integrator that use a multi-thread strategy to facilitate the interactions between the R and Java modules, such as importing raw data, passing algorithmic parameters, calling R scripts, and transporting results and messages. Figure 2: Interactive Java GUI supported by a multi-thread design strategy. 2.1 Analytic and Presentation Tasks Implemented in R The R module performs the CAM algorithm and facilitates a suite of subsequent analyses including CM, nICA, and nWCA. These tasks are performed by the three main functions: CAM-CM.R, CAM-nICA.R, and CAM-nWCA.R, which can be activated by the three R scripts: Java-runCAM-CM.R, Java-runCAM-ICA.R, and Java-runCAM-nWCA.R. The R module also performs auxiliary tasks including automatic R library installation, ﬁgure drawing, and result recording; and offers other standard methods such as nonnegative matrix factorization (Lee and Seung, 1999), Fast ICA (Hyvarinen et al., 2001), factor analysis (Child, 2006), principal component analysis, afﬁnity propagation, k-means clustering, and expectation-maximization algorithm for learning standard ﬁnite normal mixture model. 2.2 Graphic User Interface Written in Java Swing The Java GUI module allows users to import data, select algorithms and parameters, and display results. The module encloses two packages: guiView contains classes for handling frames and 2901 WANG , M ENG , C HEN , M ADHAVAN , C LARKE , H OFFMAN , X UAN AND WANG Figure 3: Application of R-Java CAM to deconvolving dynamic medical image sequence. dialogs for managing user inputs; guiModel contains classes for representing result data sets and for interacting with the R script caller. Packaged as one jar ﬁle, the GUI module runs automatically. 2.3 Functional Interaction Between R and Java We adopt the open-source program RCaller (http://code.google.com/p/rcaller) to implement the interaction between R and Java modules (Fig. 2), supported by explicitly designed R scripts such as Java-runCAM-CM.R. Speciﬁcally, ﬁve featured Java classes are introduced to interact with R for importing data or parameters, running algorithms, passing on or recording results, displaying ﬁgures, and handing over error messages. The examples of these classes include guiModel.MyRCaller.java, guiModel.MyRCaller.readResults(), and guiView.MyRPlotViewer. 3. Case Studies and Experimental Results The CAM package has been successfully applied to various data types. Using dynamic contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging data set of an advanced breast cancer case (Chen, et al., 2011b),“double click” (or command lines under Ubuntu) activated execution of CAM-Java.jar reveals two biologically interpretable vascular compartments with distinct kinetic patterns: fast clearance in the peripheral “rim” and slow clearance in the inner “core”. These outcomes are consistent with previously reported intratumor heterogeneity (Fig. 3). Angiogenesis is essential to tumor development beyond 1-2mm3 . It has been widely observed that active angiogenesis is often observed in advanced breast tumors occurring in the peripheral “rim” with co-occurrence of inner-core hypoxia. This pattern is largely due to the defective endothelial barrier function and outgrowth blood supply. In another application to natural image mixtures, CAM algorithm successfully recovered the source images in a large number of trials (see Users Manual). 4.

<p>Author: Alexander Clark</p><p>Abstract: Standard models of language learning are concerned with weak learning: the learner, receiving as input only information about the strings in the language, must learn to generalise and to generate the correct, potentially inﬁnite, set of strings generated by some target grammar. Here we deﬁne the corresponding notion of strong learning: the learner, again only receiving strings as input, must learn a grammar that generates the correct set of structures or parse trees. We formalise this using a modiﬁcation of Gold’s identiﬁcation in the limit model, requiring convergence to a grammar that is isomorphic to the target grammar. We take as our starting point a simple learning algorithm for substitutable context-free languages, based on principles of distributional learning, and modify it so that it will converge to a canonical grammar for each language. We prove a corresponding strong learning result for a subclass of context-free grammars.

<p>Author: Dana Angluin, James Aspnes, Sarah Eisenstat, Aryeh Kontorovich</p><p>Abstract: PAC learning of unrestricted regular languages is long known to be a difﬁcult problem. The class of shufﬂe ideals is a very restricted subclass of regular languages, where the shufﬂe ideal generated by a string u is the collection of all strings containing u as a subsequence. This fundamental language family is of theoretical interest in its own right and provides the building blocks for other important language families. Despite its apparent simplicity, the class of shufﬂe ideals appears quite difﬁcult to learn. In particular, just as for unrestricted regular languages, the class is not properly PAC learnable in polynomial time if RP = NP, and PAC learning the class improperly in polynomial time would imply polynomial time algorithms for certain fundamental problems in cryptography. In the positive direction, we give an efﬁcient algorithm for properly learning shufﬂe ideals in the statistical query (and therefore also PAC) model under the uniform distribution.

<p>Author: Eva L. Dyer, Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan, Richard G. Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: Unions of subspaces provide a powerful generalization of single subspace models for collections of high-dimensional data; however, learning multiple subspaces from data is challenging due to the fact that segmentation—the identiﬁcation of points that live in the same subspace—and subspace estimation must be performed simultaneously. Recently, sparse recovery methods were shown to provide a provable and robust strategy for exact feature selection (EFS)—recovering subsets of points from the ensemble that live in the same subspace. In parallel with recent studies of EFS with ℓ1 -minimization, in this paper, we develop sufﬁcient conditions for EFS with a greedy method for sparse signal recovery known as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). Following our analysis, we provide an empirical study of feature selection strategies for signals living on unions of subspaces and characterize the gap between sparse recovery methods and nearest neighbor (NN)-based approaches. In particular, we demonstrate that sparse recovery methods provide signiﬁcant advantages over NN methods and that the gap between the two approaches is particularly pronounced when the sampling of subspaces in the data set is sparse. Our results suggest that OMP may be employed to reliably recover exact feature sets in a number of regimes where NN approaches fail to reveal the subspace membership of points in the ensemble.

<p>Author: Niya Wang, Fan Meng, Li Chen, Subha Madhavan, Robert Clarke, Eric P. Hoffman, Jianhua Xuan, Yue Wang</p><p>Abstract: We describe a R-Java CAM (convex analysis of mixtures) package that provides comprehensive analytic functions and a graphic user interface (GUI) for blindly separating mixed nonnegative sources. This open-source multiplatform software implements recent and classic algorithms in the literature including Chan et al. (2008), Wang et al. (2010), Chen et al. (2011a) and Chen et al. (2011b). The CAM package offers several attractive features: (1) instead of using proprietary MATLAB, its analytic functions are written in R, which makes the codes more portable and easier to modify; (2) besides producing and plotting results in R, it also provides a Java GUI for automatic progress update and convenient visual monitoring; (3) multi-thread interactions between the R and Java modules are driven and integrated by a Java GUI, assuring that the whole CAM software runs responsively; (4) the package offers a simple mechanism to allow others to plug-in additional R-functions.

Overview Blind source separation (BSS) has proven to be a powerful and widely-applicable tool for the analysis and interpretation of composite patterns in engineering and science (Hillman and Moore, 2007; Lee and Seung, 1999). BSS is often described by a linear latent variable model X = AS, where X is the observation data matrix, A is the unknown mixing matrix, and S is the unknown source data matrix. The fundamental objective of BSS is to estimate both the unknown but informative mixing proportions and the source signals based only on the observed mixtures (Child, 2006; Cruces-Alvarez et al., 2004; Hyvarinen et al., 2001; Keshava and Mustard, 2002). While many existing BSS algorithms can usefully extract interesting patterns from mixture observations, they often prove inaccurate or even incorrect in the face of real-world BSS problems in which the pre-imposed assumptions may be invalid. There is a family of approaches exploiting the source non-negativity, including the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (Gillis, 2012; Lee and Seung, 1999). This motivates the development of alternative BSS techniques involving exploitation of source nonnegative nature (Chan et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2011a,b; Wang et al., 2010). The method works by performing convex analysis of mixtures (CAM) that automatically identiﬁes pure-source signals that reside at the vertices of the multifaceted simplex most tightly enclosing the data scatter, enabling geometrically-principled delineation of distinct source patterns from mixtures, with the number of underlying sources being suggested by the minimum description length criterion. Consider a latent variable model x(i) = As(i), where the observation vector x(i) = [x1 (i), ..., xM (i)]T can be expressed as a non-negative linear combination of the source vectors s(i) = [s1 (i), ..., sJ (i)]T , and A = [a1 , ..., aJ ] is the mixing matrix with a j being the jth column vector. This falls neatly within the deﬁnition of a convex set (Fig. 1) (Chen et al., 2011a): X= J J ∑ j=1 s j (i)a j |a j ∈ A, s j (i) ≥ 0, ∑ j=1 s j (i) = 1, i = 1, ..., N . Assume that the sources have at least one sample point whose signal is exclusively enriched in a particular source (Wang et al., 2010), we have shown that the vertex points of the observation simplex (Fig. 1) correspond to the column vectors of the mixing matrix (Chen et al., 2011b). Via a minimum-error-margin volume maximization, CAM identiﬁes the optimum set of the vertices (Chen et al., 2011b; Wang et al., 2010). Using the samples attached to the vertices, compartment modeling (CM) (Chen et al., 2011a) obtains a parametric solution of A, nonnegative independent component analysis (nICA) (Oja and Plumbley, 2004) estimates A (and s) that maximizes the independency in s, and nonnegative well-grounded component analysis (nWCA) (Wang et al., 2010) ﬁnds the column vectors of A directly from the vertex cluster centers. Figure 1: Schematic and illustrative ﬂowchart of R-Java CAM package. 2900 T HE CAM S OFTWARE IN R-JAVA In this paper we describe a newly developed R-Java CAM package whose analytic functions are written in R, while a graphic user interface (GUI) is implemented in Java, taking full advantages of both programming languages. The core software suite implements CAM functions and includes normalization, clustering, and data visualization. Multi-thread interactions between the R and Java modules are driven and integrated by a Java GUI, which not only provides convenient data or parameter passing and visual progress monitoring but also assures the responsive execution of the entire CAM software. 2. Software Design and Implementation The CAM package mainly consists of R and Java modules. The R module is a collection of main and helper functions, each represented by an R function object and achieving an independent and speciﬁc task (Fig. 1). The R module mainly performs various analytic tasks required by CAM: ﬁgure plotting, update, or error message generation. The Java module is developed to provide a GUI (Fig. 2). We adopt the model-view-controller (MVC) design strategy, and use different Java classes to separately perform information visualization and human-computer interaction. The Java module also serves as the software driver and integrator that use a multi-thread strategy to facilitate the interactions between the R and Java modules, such as importing raw data, passing algorithmic parameters, calling R scripts, and transporting results and messages. Figure 2: Interactive Java GUI supported by a multi-thread design strategy. 2.1 Analytic and Presentation Tasks Implemented in R The R module performs the CAM algorithm and facilitates a suite of subsequent analyses including CM, nICA, and nWCA. These tasks are performed by the three main functions: CAM-CM.R, CAM-nICA.R, and CAM-nWCA.R, which can be activated by the three R scripts: Java-runCAM-CM.R, Java-runCAM-ICA.R, and Java-runCAM-nWCA.R. The R module also performs auxiliary tasks including automatic R library installation, ﬁgure drawing, and result recording; and offers other standard methods such as nonnegative matrix factorization (Lee and Seung, 1999), Fast ICA (Hyvarinen et al., 2001), factor analysis (Child, 2006), principal component analysis, afﬁnity propagation, k-means clustering, and expectation-maximization algorithm for learning standard ﬁnite normal mixture model. 2.2 Graphic User Interface Written in Java Swing The Java GUI module allows users to import data, select algorithms and parameters, and display results. The module encloses two packages: guiView contains classes for handling frames and 2901 WANG , M ENG , C HEN , M ADHAVAN , C LARKE , H OFFMAN , X UAN AND WANG Figure 3: Application of R-Java CAM to deconvolving dynamic medical image sequence. dialogs for managing user inputs; guiModel contains classes for representing result data sets and for interacting with the R script caller. Packaged as one jar ﬁle, the GUI module runs automatically. 2.3 Functional Interaction Between R and Java We adopt the open-source program RCaller (http://code.google.com/p/rcaller) to implement the interaction between R and Java modules (Fig. 2), supported by explicitly designed R scripts such as Java-runCAM-CM.R. Speciﬁcally, ﬁve featured Java classes are introduced to interact with R for importing data or parameters, running algorithms, passing on or recording results, displaying ﬁgures, and handing over error messages. The examples of these classes include guiModel.MyRCaller.java, guiModel.MyRCaller.readResults(), and guiView.MyRPlotViewer. 3. Case Studies and Experimental Results The CAM package has been successfully applied to various data types. Using dynamic contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging data set of an advanced breast cancer case (Chen, et al., 2011b),“double click” (or command lines under Ubuntu) activated execution of CAM-Java.jar reveals two biologically interpretable vascular compartments with distinct kinetic patterns: fast clearance in the peripheral “rim” and slow clearance in the inner “core”.

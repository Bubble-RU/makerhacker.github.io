[sent-49, score-0.268]
</p><p>2 Here we report on the scripting part, which features interactive data analysis and component-based assembly of data mining procedures. [sent-50, score-0.363]
</p><p>3 Orange is intended both for experienced users and programmers, as well as for students of data mining. [sent-52, score-0.025]
</p><p>4 Keywords: Python, data mining, machine learning, toolbox, scripting  1. [sent-53, score-0.226]
</p><p>5 Within the context of explorative data analysis, they offer advantages like interactivity and fast prototyping by gluing together existing components or adapting them for new tasks. [sent-55, score-0.086]
</p><p>6 Python is a scripting language with clear and simple syntax, which also made it popular in education. [sent-56, score-0.226]
</p><p>7 Its relatively slow execution can be circumvented by using libraries that implement the computationally intensive tasks in lowlevel languages. [sent-57, score-0.085]
</p><p>8 Many are related to machine learning, including several general packages like scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. [sent-59, score-0.028]
</p><p>9 It focuses on simplicity, interactivity through scripting, and component-based design. [sent-64, score-0.043]
</p><p>10 Toolbox Overview Orange library is a hierarchically-organized toolbox of data mining components. [sent-67, score-0.129]
</p><p>11 The low-level procedures at the bottom of the hierarchy, like data ﬁltering, probability assessment and feature scoring, are assembled into higher-level algorithms, such as classiﬁcation tree learning. [sent-68, score-0.029]
</p><p>12 The library is designed to simplify the assembly of data analysis workﬂows and crafting of data mining approaches from a combination of existing components. [sent-71, score-0.131]
</p><p>13 Orange scripting library is also a foundation for its visual programming platform with graphical user interface components for interactive data visualization. [sent-73, score-0.31]
</p><p>14 The two major packages that are similar to Orange and are still actively developed are scikitlearn (Pedregosa et al. [sent-74, score-0.028]
</p><p>15 Both are more tightly integrated with numpy and at present better blend into Python’s numerical computing habitat. [sent-77, score-0.065]
</p><p>16 Orange was on the other hand inspired by classical machine learning that focuses on symbolic methods. [sent-78, score-0.033]
</p><p>17 These features also make Orange more suitable for interactive, explorative data analysis. [sent-82, score-0.043]
</p><p>18 7635593576372478]  We ﬁrst read the data on survival of 2,201 passengers from HMS Titanic and construct a set of learning algorithms: a naive Bayesian and SVM learner, and a stacked combination of the two (Wolpert, 1992). [sent-104, score-0.086]
</p><p>19 Running stacking on the subset of about 470 female passengers improves AUC score: >>> females = Orange. [sent-106, score-0.218]
</p><p>20 Table([d for d in data if d["sex"]=="female"]) >>> len(females) 470 >>> res = Orange. [sent-108, score-0.116]
</p><p>21 The following example deﬁnes a new learner that encloses another learner into a feature selection wrapper: it sorts the features by their information gain (as implemented in Orange. [sent-117, score-0.064]
</p><p>22 InfoGain), constructs a new data set with only the m best features and calls the base learner. [sent-120, score-0.024]
</p><p>23 base_learner = base_learner def __call__(self, data, weights=None): gain = Orange. [sent-125, score-0.031]
</p><p>24 Code Design Orange’s core is a collection of nearly 200 C++ classes that cover the basic data structures and majority of preprocessing and modeling algorithms. [sent-157, score-0.034]
</p><p>25 The C++ part is self-contained, without any calls to Python that would induce unnecessary overhead. [sent-158, score-0.024]
</p><p>26 The core includes several open source libraries, including LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011), LIBLINEAR (Fan et al. [sent-159, score-0.034]
</p><p>27 The Python layer also uses popular Python libraries numpy for linear algebra, networkx (Hagberg et al. [sent-167, score-0.176]
</p><p>28 , 2008) for working with networks and matplotlib (Hunter, 2007) for basic visualization. [sent-168, score-0.05]
</p><p>29 The upper layer of Orange is written in Python and includes procedures that are not time-critical. [sent-169, score-0.055]
</p><p>30 This is also the place at which users outside the core development group most easily contribute to the project. [sent-170, score-0.059]
</p><p>31 The code is hosted on Bitbucket repository (https:// bitbucket. [sent-175, score-0.032]
</p><p>32 Orange runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, and can also be installed from the Python Package Index repository (pip install Orange). [sent-177, score-0.032]
</p><p>33 There, we will switch to numpy-based data structures and scrap the C++ core in favor of using routines from numpy and scipy (Jones et al. [sent-185, score-0.142]
</p><p>34 , 2011) and similar libraries that did not exist when Orange was ﬁrst conceived. [sent-187, score-0.085]

<p>Author: Sergey Lisitsyn, Christian Widmer, Fernando J. Iglesias Garcia</p><p>Abstract: We present Tapkee, a C++ template library that provides efﬁcient implementations of more than 20 widely used dimensionality reduction techniques ranging from Locally Linear Embedding (Roweis and Saul, 2000) and Isomap (de Silva and Tenenbaum, 2002) to the recently introduced BarnesHut-SNE (van der Maaten, 2013). Our library was designed with a focus on performance and ﬂexibility. For performance, we combine efﬁcient multi-core algorithms, modern data structures and state-of-the-art low-level libraries. To achieve ﬂexibility, we designed a clean interface for applying methods to user data and provide a callback API that facilitates integration with the library. The library is freely available as open-source software and is distributed under the permissive BSD 3-clause license. We encourage the integration of Tapkee into other open-source toolboxes and libraries. For example, Tapkee has been integrated into the codebase of the Shogun toolbox (Sonnenburg et al., 2010), giving us access to a rich set of kernels, distance measures and bindings to common programming languages including Python, Octave, Matlab, R, Java, C#, Ruby, Perl and Lua.

<p>Author: Philipp Hennig, Martin Kiefel</p><p>Abstract: Four decades after their invention, quasi-Newton methods are still state of the art in unconstrained numerical optimization. Although not usually interpreted thus, these are learning algorithms that ﬁt a local quadratic approximation to the objective function. We show that many, including the most popular, quasi-Newton methods can be interpreted as approximations of Bayesian linear regression under varying prior assumptions. This new notion elucidates some shortcomings of classical algorithms, and lights the way to a novel nonparametric quasi-Newton method, which is able to make more efﬁcient use of available information at computational cost similar to its predecessors.

<p>Author: Nemanja Djuric, Liang Lan, Slobodan Vucetic, Zhuang Wang</p><p>Abstract: We present BudgetedSVM, an open-source C++ toolbox comprising highly-optimized implementations of recently proposed algorithms for scalable training of Support Vector Machine (SVM) approximators: Adaptive Multi-hyperplane Machines, Low-rank Linearization SVM, and Budgeted Stochastic Gradient Descent. BudgetedSVM trains models with accuracy comparable to LibSVM in time comparable to LibLinear, solving non-linear problems with millions of high-dimensional examples within minutes on a regular computer. We provide command-line and Matlab interfaces to BudgetedSVM, an efﬁcient API for handling large-scale, high-dimensional data sets, as well as detailed documentation to help developers use and further extend the toolbox.

<p>Author: Stéphan Clémençon, Marine Depecker, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: The present paper examines how the aggregation and feature randomization principles underlying the algorithm R ANDOM F OREST (Breiman, 2001) can be adapted to bipartite ranking. The approach taken here is based on nonparametric scoring and ROC curve optimization in the sense of the AUC criterion. In this problem, aggregation is used to increase the performance of scoring rules produced by ranking trees, as those developed in Cl´ mencon and Vayatis (2009c). The present work e ¸ describes the principles for building median scoring rules based on concepts from rank aggregation. Consistency results are derived for these aggregated scoring rules and an algorithm called R ANK ING F OREST is presented. Furthermore, various strategies for feature randomization are explored through a series of numerical experiments on artiﬁcial data sets.

MLPACK provides cutting-edge algorithms whose benchmarks exhibit far better performance than other leading machine learning libraries. MLPACK version 1.0.3, licensed under the LGPL, is available at http://www.mlpack.org. Keywords: C++, dual-tree algorithms, machine learning software, open source software, largescale learning 1. Introduction and Goals Though several machine learning libraries are freely available online, few, if any, offer efﬁcient algorithms to the average user. For instance, the popular Weka toolkit (Hall et al., 2009) emphasizes ease of use but scales poorly; the distributed Apache Mahout library offers scalability at a cost of higher overhead (such as clusters and powerful servers often unavailable to the average user). Also, few libraries offer breadth; for instance, libsvm (Chang and Lin, 2011) and the Tilburg MemoryBased Learner (TiMBL) are highly scalable and accessible yet each offer only a single method. MLPACK, intended to be the machine learning analog to the general-purpose LAPACK linear algebra library, aims to combine efﬁciency and accessibility. Written in C++, MLPACK uses the highly efﬁcient Armadillo matrix library (Sanderson, 2010) and is freely available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Through the use of C++ templates, MLPACK both eliminates unnecessary copying of data sets and performs expression optimizations unavailable in other languages. Also, MLPACK is, to our knowledge, unique among existing libraries in using generic programming features of C++ to allow customization of the available machine learning methods without incurring performance penalties. c 2013 Ryan R.

C URTIN , C LINE , S LAGLE , M ARCH , R AM , M EHTA AND G RAY In addition, users ranging from students to experts should ﬁnd the consistent, intuitive interface of MLPACK to be highly accessible. Finally, the source code provides references and comprehensive documentation. Four major goals of the development team of MLPACK are • • • • to implement scalable, fast machine learning algorithms, to design an intuitive, consistent, and simple API for non-expert users, to implement a variety of machine learning methods, and to provide cutting-edge machine learning algorithms unavailable elsewhere. This paper offers both an introduction to the simple and extensible API and a glimpse of the superior performance of the library. 2. Package Overview Each algorithm available in MLPACK features both a set of C++ library functions and a standalone command-line executable. Version 1.0.3 includes the following methods: • • • • • • • • • • • • • • nearest/furthest neighbor search with cover trees or kd-trees (k-nearest-neighbors) range search with cover trees or kd-trees Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) hidden Markov models (HMMs) LARS / Lasso regression k-means clustering fast hierarchical clustering (Euclidean MST calculation)1 (March et al., 2010) kernel PCA (and regular PCA) local coordinate coding1 (Yu et al., 2009) sparse coding using dictionary learning RADICAL (Robust, Accurate, Direct ICA aLgorithm) (Learned-Miller and Fisher, 2003) maximum variance unfolding (MVU) via LRSDP1 (Burer and Monteiro, 2003) the naive Bayes classiﬁer density estimation trees1 (Ram and Gray, 2011) The development team manages MLPACK with Subversion and the Trac bug reporting system, allowing easy downloads and simple bug reporting. The entire development process is transparent, so any interested user can easily contribute to the library. MLPACK can compile from source on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows; currently, different Linux distributions are reviewing MLPACK for inclusion in their package managers, which will allow users to install MLPACK without needing to compile from source. 3. A Consistent, Simple API MLPACK features a highly accessible API, both in style (such as consistent naming schemes and coding conventions) and ease of use (such as templated defaults), as well as stringent documentation standards. Consequently, a new user can execute algorithms out-of-the-box often with little or no adjustment to parameters, while the seasoned expert can expect extreme ﬂexibility in algorithmic 1. This algorithm is not available in any other comparable software package. 802 MLPACK: A S CALABLE C++ M ACHINE L EARNING L IBRARY Data Set wine cloud wine-qual isolet miniboone yp-msd corel covtype mnist randu MLPACK 0.0003 0.0069 0.0290 13.0197 20.2045 5430.0478 4.9716 14.3449 2719.8087 1020.9142 Weka 0.0621 0.1174 0.8868 213.4735 216.1469 >9000.0000 14.4264 45.9912 >9000.0000 2665.0921 Shogun 0.0277 0.5000 4.3617 37.6190 2351.4637 >9000.0000 555.9600 >9000.0000 3536.4477 >9000.0000 MATLAB 0.0021 0.0210 0.6465 46.9518 1088.1127 >9000.0000 60.8496 >9000.0000 4838.6747 1679.2893 mlpy 0.0025 0.3520 4.0431 52.0437 3219.2696 >9000.0000 209.5056 >9000.0000 5192.3586 >9000.0000 sklearn 0.0008 0.0192 0.1668 46.8016 714.2385 >9000.0000 160.4597 651.6259 5363.9650 8780.0176 Table 1: k-NN benchmarks (in seconds).

<p>Author: Stéphan Clémençon, Marine Depecker, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: The present paper examines how the aggregation and feature randomization principles underlying the algorithm R ANDOM F OREST (Breiman, 2001) can be adapted to bipartite ranking. The approach taken here is based on nonparametric scoring and ROC curve optimization in the sense of the AUC criterion. In this problem, aggregation is used to increase the performance of scoring rules produced by ranking trees, as those developed in Cl´ mencon and Vayatis (2009c). The present work e ¸ describes the principles for building median scoring rules based on concepts from rank aggregation. Consistency results are derived for these aggregated scoring rules and an algorithm called R ANK ING F OREST is presented. Furthermore, various strategies for feature randomization are explored through a series of numerical experiments on artiﬁcial data sets.

<p>Author: Joachim Niehren, Jérôme Champavère, Aurélien Lemay, Rémi Gilleron</p><p>Abstract: Inference algorithms for tree automata that deﬁne node selecting queries in unranked trees rely on tree pruning strategies. These impose additional assumptions on node selection that are needed to compensate for small numbers of annotated examples. Pruning-based heuristics in query learning algorithms for Web information extraction often boost the learning quality and speed up the learning process. We will distinguish the class of regular queries that are stable under a given schemaguided pruning strategy, and show that this class is learnable with polynomial time and data. Our learning algorithm is obtained by adding pruning heuristics to the traditional learning algorithm for tree automata from positive and negative examples. While justiﬁed by a formal learning model, our learning algorithm for stable queries also performs very well in practice of XML information extraction.

<p>Author: Aleksandr Y. Aravkin, James V. Burke, Gianluigi Pillonetto</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new class of quadratic support (QS) functions, many of which already play a crucial role in a variety of applications, including machine learning, robust statistical inference, sparsity promotion, and inverse problems such as Kalman smoothing. Well known examples of QS penalties include the ℓ2 , Huber, ℓ1 and Vapnik losses. We build on a dual representation for QS functions, using it to characterize conditions necessary to interpret these functions as negative logs of true probability densities. This interpretation establishes the foundation for statistical modeling with both known and new QS loss functions, and enables construction of non-smooth multivariate distributions with speciﬁed means and variances from simple scalar building blocks. The main contribution of this paper is a ﬂexible statistical modeling framework for a variety of learning applications, together with a toolbox of efﬁcient numerical methods for estimation. In particular, a broad subclass of QS loss functions known as piecewise linear quadratic (PLQ) penalties has a dual representation that can be exploited to design interior point (IP) methods. IP methods solve nonsmooth optimization problems by working directly with smooth systems of equations characterizing their optimality. We provide several numerical examples, along with a code that can be used to solve general PLQ problems. The efﬁciency of the IP approach depends on the structure of particular applications. We consider the class of dynamic inverse problems using Kalman smoothing. This class comprises a wide variety of applications, where the aim is to reconstruct the state of a dynamical system with known process and measurement models starting from noisy output samples.

<p>Author: Wei Wu, Zhengdong  Lu, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: The task of matching data from two heterogeneous domains naturally arises in various areas such as web search, collaborative ﬁltering, and drug design. In web search, existing work has designed relevance models to match queries and documents by exploiting either user clicks or content of queries and documents. To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been little work on principled approaches to leveraging both clicks and content to learn a matching model for search. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning to match heterogeneous objects. The framework learns two linear mappings for two objects respectively, and matches them via the dot product of their images after mapping. Moreover, when different regularizations are enforced, the framework renders a rich family of matching models. With orthonormal constraints on mapping functions, the framework subsumes Partial Least Squares (PLS) as a special case. Alternatively, with a ℓ1 +ℓ2 regularization, we obtain a new model called Regularized Mapping to Latent Structures (RMLS). RMLS enjoys many advantages over PLS, including lower time complexity and easy parallelization. To further understand the matching framework, we conduct generalization analysis and apply the result to both PLS and RMLS. We apply the framework to web search and implement both PLS and RMLS using a click-through bipartite with metadata representing features of queries and documents. We test the efﬁcacy and scalability of RMLS and PLS on large scale web search problems. The results show that both PLS and RMLS can signiﬁcantly outperform baseline methods, while RMLS substantially speeds up the learning process.

<p>Author: Chong Zhang, Yufeng Liu</p><p>Abstract: Hard and soft classiﬁers are two important groups of techniques for classiﬁcation problems. Logistic regression and Support Vector Machines are typical examples of soft and hard classiﬁers respectively. The essential difference between these two groups is whether one needs to estimate the class conditional probability for the classiﬁcation task or not. In particular, soft classiﬁers predict the label based on the obtained class conditional probabilities, while hard classiﬁers bypass the estimation of probabilities and focus on the decision boundary. In practice, for the goal of accurate classiﬁcation, it is unclear which one to use in a given situation. To tackle this problem, the Largemargin Uniﬁed Machine (LUM) was recently proposed as a uniﬁed family to embrace both groups. The LUM family enables one to study the behavior change from soft to hard binary classiﬁers. For multicategory cases, however, the concept of soft and hard classiﬁcation becomes less clear. In that case, class probability estimation becomes more involved as it requires estimation of a probability vector. In this paper, we propose a new Multicategory LUM (MLUM) framework to investigate the behavior of soft versus hard classiﬁcation under multicategory settings. Our theoretical and numerical results help to shed some light on the nature of multicategory classiﬁcation and its transition behavior from soft to hard classiﬁers. The numerical results suggest that the proposed tuned MLUM yields very competitive performance.

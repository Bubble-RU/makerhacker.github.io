<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2009-9-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume10/dasgupta09a/dasgupta09a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Sanjoy Dasgupta, Adam Tauman Kalai, Claire Monteleoni</p><p>Abstract: We start by showing that in an active learning setting, the Perceptron algorithm needs Ω( ε12 ) labels to learn linear separators within generalization error ε. We then present a simple active learning algorithm for this problem, which combines a modiﬁcation of the Perceptron update with an adaptive ﬁltering rule for deciding which points to query. For data distributed uniformly over the unit ˜ sphere, we show that our algorithm reaches generalization error ε after asking for just O(d log 1 ) ε labels. This exponential improvement over the usual sample complexity of supervised learning had previously been demonstrated only for the computationally more complex query-by-committee algorithm. Keywords: active learning, perceptron, label complexity bounds, online learning</p><br/>

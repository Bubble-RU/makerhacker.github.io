<h1>79 jmlr-2009-Reinforcement Learning in Finite MDPs: PAC Analysis</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2009-79-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume10/strehl09a/strehl09a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Alexander L. Strehl, Lihong Li, Michael L. Littman</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning near-optimal behavior in ﬁnite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a polynomial number of samples. These “PAC-MDP” algorithms include the wellknown E3 and R-MAX algorithms as well as the more recent Delayed Q-learning algorithm. We summarize the current state-of-the-art by presenting bounds for the problem in a uniﬁed theoretical framework. A more reﬁned analysis for upper and lower bounds is presented to yield insight into the differences between the model-free Delayed Q-learning and the model-based R-MAX. Keywords: reinforcement learning, Markov decision processes, PAC-MDP, exploration, sample complexity</p><br/>

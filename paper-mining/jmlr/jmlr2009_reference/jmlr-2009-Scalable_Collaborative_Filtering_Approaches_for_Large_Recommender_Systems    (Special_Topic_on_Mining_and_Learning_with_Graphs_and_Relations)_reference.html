<h1>84 jmlr-2009-Scalable Collaborative Filtering Approaches for Large Recommender Systems    (Special Topic on Mining and Learning with Graphs and Relations)</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2009-84-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume10/takacs09a/takacs09a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Gábor Takács, István Pilászy, Bottyán Németh, Domonkos Tikk</p><p>Abstract: The collaborative ﬁltering (CF) using known user ratings of items has proved to be effective for predicting user preferences in item selection. This thriving subﬁeld of machine learning became popular in the late 1990s with the spread of online services that use recommender systems, such as Amazon, Yahoo! Music, and Netﬂix. CF approaches are usually designed to work on very large data sets. Therefore the scalability of the methods is crucial. In this work, we propose various scalable solutions that are validated against the Netﬂix Prize data set, currently the largest publicly available collection. First, we propose various matrix factorization (MF) based techniques. Second, a neighbor correction method for MF is outlined, which alloys the global perspective of MF and the localized property of neighbor based approaches efﬁciently. In the experimentation section, we ﬁrst report on some implementation issues, and we suggest on how parameter optimization can be performed efﬁciently for MFs. We then show that the proposed scalable approaches compare favorably with existing ones in terms of prediction accuracy and/or required training time. Finally, we report on some experiments performed on MovieLens and Jester data sets. Keywords: collaborative ﬁltering, recommender systems, matrix factorization, neighbor based correction, Netﬂix prize ∗.

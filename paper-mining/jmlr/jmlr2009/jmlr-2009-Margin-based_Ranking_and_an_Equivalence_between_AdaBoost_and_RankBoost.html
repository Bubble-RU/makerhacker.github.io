<p>Author: Cynthia Rudin</p><p>Abstract: We are interested in supervised ranking algorithms that perform especially well near the top of the ranked list, and are only required to perform sufﬁciently well on the rest of the list. In this work, we provide a general form of convex objective that gives high-scoring examples more importance. This “push” near the top of the list can be chosen arbitrarily large or small, based on the preference of the user. We choose ℓ p -norms to provide a speciﬁc type of push; if the user sets p larger, the objective concentrates harder on the top of the list. We derive a generalization bound based on the p-norm objective, working around the natural asymmetry of the problem. We then derive a boosting-style algorithm for the problem of ranking with a push at the top. The usefulness of the algorithm is illustrated through experiments on repository data. We prove that the minimizer of the algorithm’s objective is unique in a speciﬁc sense. Furthermore, we illustrate how our objective is related to quality measurements for information retrieval.

<p>Author: Shivani Agarwal, Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: The problem of ranking, in which the goal is to learn a real-valued ranking function that induces a ranking or ordering over an instance space, has recently gained much attention in machine learning. We study generalization properties of ranking algorithms using the notion of algorithmic stability; in particular, we derive generalization bounds for ranking algorithms that have good stability properties. We show that kernel-based ranking algorithms that perform regularization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space have such stability properties, and therefore our bounds can be applied to these algorithms; this is in contrast with generalization bounds based on uniform convergence, which in many cases cannot be applied to these algorithms. Our results generalize earlier results that were derived in the special setting of bipartite ranking (Agarwal and Niyogi, 2005) to a more general setting of the ranking problem that arises frequently in applications.

<p>Author: André F. T. Martins, Noah A. Smith, Eric P. Xing, Pedro M. Q. Aguiar, Mário A. T. Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: Positive deﬁnite kernels on probability measures have been recently applied to classiﬁcation problems involving text, images, and other types of structured data. Some of these kernels are related to classic information theoretic quantities, such as (Shannon’s) mutual information and the JensenShannon (JS) divergence. Meanwhile, there have been recent advances in nonextensive generalizations of Shannon’s information theory. This paper bridges these two trends by introducing nonextensive information theoretic kernels on probability measures, based on new JS-type divergences. These new divergences result from extending the the two building blocks of the classical JS divergence: convexity and Shannon’s entropy. The notion of convexity is extended to the wider concept of q-convexity, for which we prove a Jensen q-inequality. Based on this inequality, we introduce Jensen-Tsallis (JT) q-differences, a nonextensive generalization of the JS divergence, and deﬁne a k-th order JT q-difference between stochastic processes. We then deﬁne a new family of nonextensive mutual information kernels, which allow weights to be assigned to their arguments, and which includes the Boolean, JS, and linear kernels as particular cases. Nonextensive string kernels are also deﬁned that generalize the p-spectrum kernel. We illustrate the performance of these kernels on text categorization tasks, in which documents are modeled both as bags of words and as sequences of characters.

<p>Author: Holger Höfling, Robert Tibshirani</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problems of estimating the parameters as well as the structure of binary-valued Markov networks. For maximizing the penalized log-likelihood, we implement an approximate procedure based on the pseudo-likelihood of Besag (1975) and generalize it to a fast exact algorithm. The exact algorithm starts with the pseudo-likelihood solution and then adjusts the pseudolikelihood criterion so that each additional iterations moves it closer to the exact solution. Our results show that this procedure is faster than the competing exact method proposed by Lee, Ganapathi, and Koller (2006a). However, we also ﬁnd that the approximate pseudo-likelihood as well as the approaches of Wainwright et al. (2006), when implemented using the coordinate descent procedure of Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2008b), are much faster than the exact methods, and only slightly less accurate.

<p>Author: Charles Dugas, Yoshua Bengio, François Bélisle, Claude Nadeau, René Garcia</p><p>Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge of a particular task into the architecture of a learning algorithm can greatly improve generalization performance. We study here a case where we know that the function to be learned is non-decreasing in its two arguments and convex in one of them. For this purpose we propose a class of functions similar to multi-layer neural networks but (1) that has those properties, (2) is a universal approximator of Lipschitz1 functions with these and other properties. We apply this new class of functions to the task of modelling the price of call options. Experiments show improvements on regressing the price of call options using the new types of function classes that incorporate the a priori constraints.

<p>Author: Francis Maes</p><p>Abstract: N IEME,1 In this paper we introduce a machine learning library for large-scale classiﬁcation, regression and ranking. N IEME relies on the framework of energy-based models (LeCun et al., 2006) which uniﬁes several learning algorithms ranging from simple perceptrons to recent models such as the pegasos support vector machine or l1-regularized maximum entropy models. This framework also uniﬁes batch and stochastic learning which are both seen as energy minimization problems. N IEME can hence be used in a wide range of situations, but is particularly interesting for large-scale learning tasks where both the examples and the features are processed incrementally. Being able to deal with new incoming features at any time within the learning process is another original feature of the N IEME toolbox. N IEME is released under the GPL license. It is efﬁciently implemented in C++, it works on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows and provides interfaces for C++, Java and Python.

<p>Author: Cynthia Rudin, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: We study boosting algorithms for learning to rank. We give a general margin-based bound for ranking based on covering numbers for the hypothesis space. Our bound suggests that algorithms that maximize the ranking margin will generalize well. We then describe a new algorithm, smooth margin ranking, that precisely converges to a maximum ranking-margin solution. The algorithm is a modiﬁcation of RankBoost, analogous to “approximate coordinate ascent boosting.” Finally, we prove that AdaBoost and RankBoost are equally good for the problems of bipartite ranking and classiﬁcation in terms of their asymptotic behavior on the training set. Under natural conditions, AdaBoost achieves an area under the ROC curve that is equally as good as RankBoost’s; furthermore, RankBoost, when given a speciﬁc intercept, achieves a misclassiﬁcation error that is as good as AdaBoost’s. This may help to explain the empirical observations made by Cortes and Mohri, and Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, about the excellent performance of AdaBoost as a bipartite ranking algorithm, as measured by the area under the ROC curve.

<p>Author: Cynthia Rudin</p><p>Abstract: We are interested in supervised ranking algorithms that perform especially well near the top of the ranked list, and are only required to perform sufﬁciently well on the rest of the list. In this work, we provide a general form of convex objective that gives high-scoring examples more importance. This “push” near the top of the list can be chosen arbitrarily large or small, based on the preference of the user. We choose ℓ p -norms to provide a speciﬁc type of push; if the user sets p larger, the objective concentrates harder on the top of the list. We derive a generalization bound based on the p-norm objective, working around the natural asymmetry of the problem. We then derive a boosting-style algorithm for the problem of ranking with a push at the top. The usefulness of the algorithm is illustrated through experiments on repository data. We prove that the minimizer of the algorithm’s objective is unique in a speciﬁc sense. Furthermore, we illustrate how our objective is related to quality measurements for information retrieval.

<p>Author: Ting Hu, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Learning algorithms are based on samples which are often drawn independently from an identical distribution (i.i.d.). In this paper we consider a different setting with samples drawn according to a non-identical sequence of probability distributions. Each time a sample is drawn from a different distribution. In this setting we investigate a fully online learning algorithm associated with a general convex loss function and a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Error analysis is conducted under the assumption that the sequence of marginal distributions converges polynomially in the dual of a H¨ lder space. For regression with least square or insensitive loss, learning rates are given o in both the RKHS norm and the L2 norm. For classiﬁcation with hinge loss and support vector machine q-norm loss, rates are explicitly stated with respect to the excess misclassiﬁcation error.

<p>Author: Leonid (Aryeh) Kontorovich, Boaz Nadler</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for supervised learning of discrete concepts. Since the 1970’s, the standard computational primitive has been to ﬁnd the most consistent hypothesis in a given complexity class. In contrast, in this paper we propose a new basic operation: for each pair of input instances, count how many concepts of bounded complexity contain both of them. Our approach maps instances to a Hilbert space, whose metric is induced by a universal kernel coinciding with our computational primitive, and identiﬁes concepts with half-spaces. We prove that all concepts are linearly separable under this mapping. Hence, given a labeled sample and an oracle for evaluating the universal kernel, we can efﬁciently compute a linear classiﬁer (via SVM, for example) and use margin bounds to control its generalization error. Even though exact evaluation of the universal kernel may be infeasible, in various natural situations it is efﬁciently approximable. Though our approach is general, our main application is to regular languages. Our approach presents a substantial departure from current learning paradigms and in particular yields a novel method for learning this fundamental concept class. Unlike existing techniques, we make no structural assumptions on the corresponding unknown automata, the string distribution or the completeness of the training set. Instead, given a labeled sample our algorithm outputs a classiﬁer with guaranteed distribution-free generalization bounds; to our knowledge, the proposed framework is the only one capable of achieving the latter. Along the way, we touch upon several fundamental questions in complexity, automata, and machine learning.

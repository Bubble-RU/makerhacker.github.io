</p><p>2 Keywords: Bayesian networks, python, open source software  1. [sent-9, score-0.137]
</p><p>3 Introduction Bayesian networks (BN) have become a popular methodology in many ﬁelds because they can model nonlinear, multimodal relationships using noisy, inconsistent data. [sent-10, score-0.046]
</p><p>4 Although learning the structure of BNs from data is now common, there is still a great need for high-quality open-source software that can meet the needs of various users. [sent-11, score-0.088]
</p><p>5 End users require software that is easy to use; supports learning with different data types; can accommodate missing values and hidden variables; and can take advantage of various computational clusters and grids. [sent-12, score-0.147]
</p><p>6 Researchers require a framework for developing and testing new algorithms and translating them into usable software. [sent-13, score-0.044]
</p><p>7 We have developed the Python Environment for Bayesian Learning (PEBL) to meet these needs. [sent-14, score-0.027]
</p><p>8 PEBL Features PEBL provides many features for working with data and BNs; some of the more notable ones are listed below. [sent-16, score-0.026]
</p><p>9 Data collected following an intervention is important for determining causality but requires an altered scoring procedure (Pe’er et al. [sent-19, score-0.045]
</p><p>10 PEBL uses the BDe metric for scoring networks and handles interventional data using the method described by Yoo et al. [sent-22, score-0.146]

</p><p>13 /myoutput (b) PEBL conﬁguration ﬁle  Figure 1: Two ways of using PEBL: with a Python script and a conﬁguration ﬁle. [sent-41, score-0.121]
</p><p>14 Both methods create 10 greedy learners with default parameters and run them on an Apple Xgid. [sent-42, score-0.085]
</p><p>15 The Python script can be typed in an interactive shell, run as a script or included as part of a larger application. [sent-43, score-0.311]
</p><p>16 PEBL can handle missing values and hidden variables using exact marginalization and Gibbs sampling (Heckerman, 1998). [sent-44, score-0.064]
</p><p>17 The Gibbs sampler can be resumed from a previously suspended state, allowing for interactive inspection of preliminary results or a manual strategy for determining satisfactory convergence. [sent-45, score-0.093]
</p><p>18 PEBL supports structural priors over edges speciﬁed as ’hard’ constraints or ’soft’ energy matrices (Imoto et al. [sent-47, score-0.093]
</p><p>19 , 2003) and arbitrary constraints speciﬁed as Python functions or lambda expressions. [sent-48, score-0.02]

</p><p>21 Efﬁcient implementaion of learners requires careful programming to eliminate redundant computation. [sent-50, score-0.085]
</p><p>22 PEBL provides components to alter, score and rollback changes to BNs in a simple, transactional manner and with these, efﬁcient learners look remarkably similar to pseudocode. [sent-51, score-0.085]
</p><p>23 2 Convenience and Scalability includes both a library and a command line application. [sent-53, score-0.079]
</p><p>24 It aims for a balance between ease of use, extensibility and performance. [sent-54, score-0.045]
</p><p>25 Critical sections use the numpy library (Ascher et al. [sent-56, score-0.057]
</p><p>26 , 2001) for high-performance matrix operations and custom extensions written in ANSI C for portability and speed. [sent-57, score-0.066]
</p><p>27 Python provides interactive shells and notebook interfaces and includes an extensive standard library and many third-party packages. [sent-59, score-0.104]
</p><p>28 Figure 1 shows a script and conﬁguration ﬁle example that showcase the ease of using PEBL. [sent-61, score-0.142]
</p><p>29 Table 1: Comparing the features of popular Bayesian network structure learning software. [sent-73, score-0.026]
</p><p>30 While many tasks related to Bayesian learning are embarrassingly parallel in theory, few software packages take advantage of it. [sent-74, score-0.179]
</p><p>31 PEBL can execute learning tasks in parallel over multiple processors or CPU cores, an Apple Xgrid,1 an IPython cluster2 or the Amazon EC2 platform. [sent-75, score-0.089]
</p><p>32 3 The EC2 platform is especially attractive for scientists because it allows one to rent processing power on an on-demand basis and execute PEBL tasks on them. [sent-76, score-0.128]
</p><p>33 With appropriate conﬁguration settings and the use of parallel execution, PEBL can be used for large learning tasks. [sent-77, score-0.058]
</p><p>34 PEBL Development The beneﬁts of open source software derive not just from the freedoms afforded by the software license but also from the open and collaborative development model. [sent-81, score-0.313]
</p><p>35 PEBL’s source code repository and issue tracker are hosted at Google Code and freely available to all. [sent-82, score-0.121]
</p><p>36 Additionally, PEBL includes over 200 automated unit tests and mandates that every source code submission and resolved error be accompanied with tests. [sent-83, score-0.119]
</p><p>37 Related Software While there are many software tools for working with BNs, most focus on parameter learning and inference rather than structure learning. [sent-85, score-0.061]
</p><p>38 Of the few tools for structure learning, few are open-source and none provide the set of features included in PEBL. [sent-86, score-0.026]
</p><p>39 As shown in Table 1, the ability to handle interventional data, model with missing values and hidden variables, use soft and arbitrary priors and exploit parallel platforms are unique to PEBL. [sent-87, score-0.317]

Dlib-ml is an open source library, targeted at both engineers and research scientists, which aims to provide a similarly rich environment for developing machine learning software in the C++ language. Towards this end, dlib-ml contains an extensible linear algebra toolkit with built in BLAS support. It also houses implementations of algorithms for performing inference in Bayesian networks and kernel-based methods for classiﬁcation, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and feature ranking. To enable easy use of these tools, the entire library has been developed with contract programming, which provides complete and precise documentation as well as powerful debugging tools.

<p>Author: Francis Maes</p><p>Abstract: N IEME,1 In this paper we introduce a machine learning library for large-scale classiﬁcation, regression and ranking. N IEME relies on the framework of energy-based models (LeCun et al., 2006) which uniﬁes several learning algorithms ranging from simple perceptrons to recent models such as the pegasos support vector machine or l1-regularized maximum entropy models. This framework also uniﬁes batch and stochastic learning which are both seen as energy minimization problems. N IEME can hence be used in a wide range of situations, but is particularly interesting for large-scale learning tasks where both the examples and the features are processed incrementally. Being able to deal with new incoming features at any time within the learning process is another original feature of the N IEME toolbox. N IEME is released under the GPL license. It is efﬁciently implemented in C++, it works on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows and provides interfaces for C++, Java and Python.

The interfaces for each type of algorithm are kept simple and algorithms strictly follow their respective interface.

The implementations of the algorithms are clearly written, properly documented and can thus be used as a reference.

<p>Author: Brian Tanner, Adam White</p><p>Abstract: RL-Glue is a standard, language-independent software package for reinforcement-learning experiments. The standardization provided by RL-Glue facilitates code sharing and collaboration. Code sharing reduces the need to re-engineer tasks and experimental apparatus, both common barriers to comparatively evaluating new ideas in the context of the literature. Our software features a minimalist interface and works with several languages and computing platforms. RL-Glue compatibility can be extended to any programming language that supports network socket communication. RL-Glue has been used to teach classes, to run international competitions, and is currently used by several other open-source software and hardware projects. Keywords: reinforcement learning, empirical evaluation, standardization, open source 1. Introduction and Motivation Reinforcement learning is an embodied, trial-and-error problem formulation for artiﬁcial intelligence (Sutton and Barto, 1998; Kaelbling et al., 1996; Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996). At a series of time steps, the agent emits actions in response to observations and rewards generated by the environment. The agent’s objective is to select actions that maximize the future rewards. Reinforcementlearning methods have been successfully applied to many problems including backgammon (Tesauro, 1994), elevator control (Crites and Barto, 1998), and helicopter control (Ng et al., 2004). Reinforcementlearning models and formalisms have inﬂuenced a number of ﬁelds, including operations research, cognitive science, optimal control, psychology, neuroscience, and others. Reinforcement-learning practitioners create their agents and environments using various incompatible software frameworks, making collaboration inconvenient and thus slowing progress in our community. It can be time consuming, difﬁcult, and sometimes even impossible to exactly reproduce the work of others. A conference or journal article is not the appropriate medium to share a sufﬁciently detailed speciﬁcation of the environment, agent and overall experimental apparatus. We need a convenient way to share source code. We believe that a standard programming interface for reinforcement-learning experiments will remove some barriers to collaboration and accelerate the pace of research in our ﬁeld. To encourage widespread adoption, this interface should be easy to adhere to, and it should not force users to abandon their favorite tools or languages. With these goals in mind, we have developed RL-Glue: language independent software for reinforcement-learning experiments. c 2009 Brian Tanner and Adam White. TANNER AND W HITE 2. RL-Glue Reinforcement-learning environments cannot be stored as ﬁxed data-sets, as is common in conventional supervised machine learning. The environment generates observations and rewards in response to actions selected by the agent, making it more natural to think of the environment and agent as interactive programs. Sutton and Barto describe one prevalent view of agent-environment interactions in their introductory text (1998). Their view, shown in Figure 1, clearly separates the agent and environment into different components which interact in a particular way, following a particular sequence. observation ot reward rt Agent action at rt+1 Environment ot+1 Figure 1: Sutton and Barto’s agent-environment interface, with states generalized to observations. White’s RL-Glue Protocol (2006) formalizes Sutton and Barto’s interface for online, singleagent reinforcement learning. The RL-Glue Protocol describes how the different aspects of a reinforcement-learning experiment should be arranged into programs, and the etiquette they should follow when communicating with each other. These programs (Figure 2) are the agent, the environment, the experiment, and RL-Glue. The agent program implements the learning algorithm and action-selection mechanism. The environment program implements the dynamics of the task and generates the observations and rewards. The experiment program directs the experiment’s execution, including the sequence of agent-environment interactions and agent performance evaluation. The RL-Glue program mediates the communication between the agent and environment programs in response to commands from the experiment program. Our RL-Glue software (RL-Glue) implements White’s protocol.1 Experiment Program Agent Program RL-Glue Program Environment Program Figure 2: The four programs speciﬁed by the RL-Glue Protocol. Arrows indicate the direction of the ﬂow of control. RL-Glue can be used either in internal or external mode. In internal mode, the agent, environment and experiment are linked into a single program, and their communication is through function calls. Internal mode is currently an option if the agent, environment, and experiment are written exclusively in Java or C/C++. In external mode, the agent, environment and experiment are linked 1. This can be found at http://glue.rl-community.org/protocol. 2134 RL-G LUE into separate programs. Each program connects to the RL-Glue server program, and all communication is over TCP/IP socket connections. External mode allows these programs to be written in any programming language that supports socket communication. External mode is currently supported for C/C++, Java, Python, Lisp, and Matlab. Each mode has its strengths and weaknesses. Internal mode has less overhead, so it can execute more steps per second. External mode is more ﬂexible and portable. The performance difference between the two modes vanishes as the agent or environment becomes complex enough that computation dominates the socket overhead in terms of time per step. The agent and environment are indifferent and unaware of their execution mode; the difference in modes lies only in how the agent and environment are linked or loaded. 3. RL-Glue in Practice RL-Glue’s provides a common interface for a number of software and hardware projects in the reinforcement-learning community. For example, there is the annual RL-Competition, where teams from around the world compare their agents on a variety of challenging environments. The competition software uses the API, called RL-Viz, that is layered on top of RL-Glue to dynamically load agent and environment programs, modify parameters at runtime and visualize interaction and performance. All of the environments and sample agents created by the competition organizers are added to the RL-Library, a public, community-supported repository of RL-Glue compatible code. The RL-Library is also available as an archive of top competition agents, challenge problems, project code from academic publications, or any other RL-Glue compatible software that members of our community would like to share. The socket architecture of RL-Glue allows diverse software and hardware platforms to be connected as RL-Glue environment programs. There are ongoing projects that connect a mobile robot platform, a keepaway soccer server, a real-time strategy game, and an Atari emulator to RL-Glue. Our socket architecture helps lower the barriers for researchers wishing to work on larger scale environments by providing a simple and familiar interface. RL-Glue has been used for teaching reinforcement learning in several university courses and to create experiments for scientiﬁc articles published in leading conferences. See our RL-Glue in practice web page for an updated list of projects and papers that have used RL-Glue.2 4. Other Reinforcement-Learning Software Projects RL-Glue is not the ﬁrst software project that aims to standardize empirical reinforcement learning or to make agent and environment programs more accessible within our community. However, RLGlue is the only project that offers a standardized language-independent interface, rich actions and observations, and ﬁne-grained control of the experiment. Other projects, most notably: CLSquare,3 PIQLE,4 RL Toolbox,5 JRLF,6 and LibPG,7 offer signiﬁcant value to the reinforcement-learning community by offering agents and environments, 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.

Our design makes it relatively easy to interface existing frameworks with RL-Glue. We are currently offering our assistance in bridging other frameworks to RL-Glue, with the hope of improving access to all of these tools for all members of our community. 5. RL-Glue Open Source Project Website: http://glue.rl-community.org License: Apache 2.0 RL-Glue is more than an interface; it connects a family of community projects, with many levels of possible participation. Members of the community are invited to submit agent, environment and experiment programs to the RL-Library. Developers can also extend the reach of RL-Glue compatibility by writing external-mode or internal-mode interfaces for their favorite programming language. The RL-Glue software project also welcomes submissions and improvements for all parts of the software and documentation.

Dlib-ml is an open source library, targeted at both engineers and research scientists, which aims to provide a similarly rich environment for developing machine learning software in the C++ language. Towards this end, dlib-ml contains an extensible linear algebra toolkit with built in BLAS support. It also houses implementations of algorithms for performing inference in Bayesian networks and kernel-based methods for classiﬁcation, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and feature ranking. To enable easy use of these tools, the entire library has been developed with contract programming, which provides complete and precise documentation as well as powerful debugging tools.

N IEME relies on the framework of energy-based models (LeCun et al., 2006) which uniﬁes several learning algorithms ranging from simple perceptrons to recent models such as the pegasos support vector machine or l1-regularized maximum entropy models. This framework also uniﬁes batch and stochastic learning which are both seen as energy minimization problems. N IEME can hence be used in a wide range of situations, but is particularly interesting for large-scale learning tasks where both the examples and the features are processed incrementally.

One of the fundamental theoretical properties justifying the usage of the Bayesian scoring criterion is its consistency.

<p>Author: Brian Tanner, Adam White</p><p>Abstract: RL-Glue is a standard, language-independent software package for reinforcement-learning experiments. The standardization provided by RL-Glue facilitates code sharing and collaboration. Code sharing reduces the need to re-engineer tasks and experimental apparatus, both common barriers to comparatively evaluating new ideas in the context of the literature. Our software features a minimalist interface and works with several languages and computing platforms. RL-Glue compatibility can be extended to any programming language that supports network socket communication. RL-Glue has been used to teach classes, to run international competitions, and is currently used by several other open-source software and hardware projects. Keywords: reinforcement learning, empirical evaluation, standardization, open source 1. Introduction and Motivation Reinforcement learning is an embodied, trial-and-error problem formulation for artiﬁcial intelligence (Sutton and Barto, 1998; Kaelbling et al., 1996; Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996). At a series of time steps, the agent emits actions in response to observations and rewards generated by the environment. The agent’s objective is to select actions that maximize the future rewards. Reinforcementlearning methods have been successfully applied to many problems including backgammon (Tesauro, 1994), elevator control (Crites and Barto, 1998), and helicopter control (Ng et al., 2004). Reinforcementlearning models and formalisms have inﬂuenced a number of ﬁelds, including operations research, cognitive science, optimal control, psychology, neuroscience, and others. Reinforcement-learning practitioners create their agents and environments using various incompatible software frameworks, making collaboration inconvenient and thus slowing progress in our community. It can be time consuming, difﬁcult, and sometimes even impossible to exactly reproduce the work of others. A conference or journal article is not the appropriate medium to share a sufﬁciently detailed speciﬁcation of the environment, agent and overall experimental apparatus. We need a convenient way to share source code. We believe that a standard programming interface for reinforcement-learning experiments will remove some barriers to collaboration and accelerate the pace of research in our ﬁeld. To encourage widespread adoption, this interface should be easy to adhere to, and it should not force users to abandon their favorite tools or languages. With these goals in mind, we have developed RL-Glue: language independent software for reinforcement-learning experiments. c 2009 Brian Tanner and Adam White. TANNER AND W HITE 2. RL-Glue Reinforcement-learning environments cannot be stored as ﬁxed data-sets, as is common in conventional supervised machine learning. The environment generates observations and rewards in response to actions selected by the agent, making it more natural to think of the environment and agent as interactive programs. Sutton and Barto describe one prevalent view of agent-environment interactions in their introductory text (1998). Their view, shown in Figure 1, clearly separates the agent and environment into different components which interact in a particular way, following a particular sequence. observation ot reward rt Agent action at rt+1 Environment ot+1 Figure 1: Sutton and Barto’s agent-environment interface, with states generalized to observations. White’s RL-Glue Protocol (2006) formalizes Sutton and Barto’s interface for online, singleagent reinforcement learning. The RL-Glue Protocol describes how the different aspects of a reinforcement-learning experiment should be arranged into programs, and the etiquette they should follow when communicating with each other. These programs (Figure 2) are the agent, the environment, the experiment, and RL-Glue. The agent program implements the learning algorithm and action-selection mechanism. The environment program implements the dynamics of the task and generates the observations and rewards. The experiment program directs the experiment’s execution, including the sequence of agent-environment interactions and agent performance evaluation. The RL-Glue program mediates the communication between the agent and environment programs in response to commands from the experiment program. Our RL-Glue software (RL-Glue) implements White’s protocol.1 Experiment Program Agent Program RL-Glue Program Environment Program Figure 2: The four programs speciﬁed by the RL-Glue Protocol. Arrows indicate the direction of the ﬂow of control. RL-Glue can be used either in internal or external mode. In internal mode, the agent, environment and experiment are linked into a single program, and their communication is through function calls. Internal mode is currently an option if the agent, environment, and experiment are written exclusively in Java or C/C++. In external mode, the agent, environment and experiment are linked 1. This can be found at http://glue.rl-community.org/protocol. 2134 RL-G LUE into separate programs. Each program connects to the RL-Glue server program, and all communication is over TCP/IP socket connections. External mode allows these programs to be written in any programming language that supports socket communication. External mode is currently supported for C/C++, Java, Python, Lisp, and Matlab. Each mode has its strengths and weaknesses. Internal mode has less overhead, so it can execute more steps per second. External mode is more ﬂexible and portable. The performance difference between the two modes vanishes as the agent or environment becomes complex enough that computation dominates the socket overhead in terms of time per step. The agent and environment are indifferent and unaware of their execution mode; the difference in modes lies only in how the agent and environment are linked or loaded. 3. RL-Glue in Practice RL-Glue’s provides a common interface for a number of software and hardware projects in the reinforcement-learning community. For example, there is the annual RL-Competition, where teams from around the world compare their agents on a variety of challenging environments. The competition software uses the API, called RL-Viz, that is layered on top of RL-Glue to dynamically load agent and environment programs, modify parameters at runtime and visualize interaction and performance. All of the environments and sample agents created by the competition organizers are added to the RL-Library, a public, community-supported repository of RL-Glue compatible code. The RL-Library is also available as an archive of top competition agents, challenge problems, project code from academic publications, or any other RL-Glue compatible software that members of our community would like to share. The socket architecture of RL-Glue allows diverse software and hardware platforms to be connected as RL-Glue environment programs. There are ongoing projects that connect a mobile robot platform, a keepaway soccer server, a real-time strategy game, and an Atari emulator to RL-Glue. Our socket architecture helps lower the barriers for researchers wishing to work on larger scale environments by providing a simple and familiar interface. RL-Glue has been used for teaching reinforcement learning in several university courses and to create experiments for scientiﬁc articles published in leading conferences. See our RL-Glue in practice web page for an updated list of projects and papers that have used RL-Glue.2 4. Other Reinforcement-Learning Software Projects RL-Glue is not the ﬁrst software project that aims to standardize empirical reinforcement learning or to make agent and environment programs more accessible within our community. However, RLGlue is the only project that offers a standardized language-independent interface, rich actions and observations, and ﬁne-grained control of the experiment. Other projects, most notably: CLSquare,3 PIQLE,4 RL Toolbox,5 JRLF,6 and LibPG,7 offer signiﬁcant value to the reinforcement-learning community by offering agents and environments, 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.

Our design makes it relatively easy to interface existing frameworks with RL-Glue. We are currently offering our assistance in bridging other frameworks to RL-Glue, with the hope of improving access to all of these tools for all members of our community. 5. RL-Glue Open Source Project Website: http://glue.rl-community.org License: Apache 2.0 RL-Glue is more than an interface; it connects a family of community projects, with many levels of possible participation. Members of the community are invited to submit agent, environment and experiment programs to the RL-Library. Developers can also extend the reach of RL-Glue compatibility by writing external-mode or internal-mode interfaces for their favorite programming language. The RL-Glue software project also welcomes submissions and improvements for all parts of the software and documentation.

N IEME can hence be used in a wide range of situations, but is particularly interesting for large-scale learning tasks where both the examples and the features are processed incrementally. Being able to deal with new incoming features at any time within the learning process is another original feature of the N IEME toolbox. N IEME is released under the GPL license. It is efﬁciently implemented in C++, it works on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows and provides interfaces for C++, Java and Python.

<p>Author: Davis E. King</p><p>Abstract: There are many excellent toolkits which provide support for developing machine learning software in Python, R, Matlab, and similar environments. Dlib-ml is an open source library, targeted at both engineers and research scientists, which aims to provide a similarly rich environment for developing machine learning software in the C++ language. Towards this end, dlib-ml contains an extensible linear algebra toolkit with built in BLAS support. It also houses implementations of algorithms for performing inference in Bayesian networks and kernel-based methods for classiﬁcation, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and feature ranking. To enable easy use of these tools, the entire library has been developed with contract programming, which provides complete and precise documentation as well as powerful debugging tools.

<p>Author: Brian Tanner, Adam White</p><p>Abstract: RL-Glue is a standard, language-independent software package for reinforcement-learning experiments. The standardization provided by RL-Glue facilitates code sharing and collaboration. Code sharing reduces the need to re-engineer tasks and experimental apparatus, both common barriers to comparatively evaluating new ideas in the context of the literature. Our software features a minimalist interface and works with several languages and computing platforms. RL-Glue compatibility can be extended to any programming language that supports network socket communication. RL-Glue has been used to teach classes, to run international competitions, and is currently used by several other open-source software and hardware projects. Keywords: reinforcement learning, empirical evaluation, standardization, open source 1. Introduction and Motivation Reinforcement learning is an embodied, trial-and-error problem formulation for artiﬁcial intelligence (Sutton and Barto, 1998; Kaelbling et al., 1996; Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996). At a series of time steps, the agent emits actions in response to observations and rewards generated by the environment. The agent’s objective is to select actions that maximize the future rewards. Reinforcementlearning methods have been successfully applied to many problems including backgammon (Tesauro, 1994), elevator control (Crites and Barto, 1998), and helicopter control (Ng et al., 2004). Reinforcementlearning models and formalisms have inﬂuenced a number of ﬁelds, including operations research, cognitive science, optimal control, psychology, neuroscience, and others. Reinforcement-learning practitioners create their agents and environments using various incompatible software frameworks, making collaboration inconvenient and thus slowing progress in our community. It can be time consuming, difﬁcult, and sometimes even impossible to exactly reproduce the work of others. A conference or journal article is not the appropriate medium to share a sufﬁciently detailed speciﬁcation of the environment, agent and overall experimental apparatus. We need a convenient way to share source code. We believe that a standard programming interface for reinforcement-learning experiments will remove some barriers to collaboration and accelerate the pace of research in our ﬁeld. To encourage widespread adoption, this interface should be easy to adhere to, and it should not force users to abandon their favorite tools or languages. With these goals in mind, we have developed RL-Glue: language independent software for reinforcement-learning experiments. c 2009 Brian Tanner and Adam White. TANNER AND W HITE 2. RL-Glue Reinforcement-learning environments cannot be stored as ﬁxed data-sets, as is common in conventional supervised machine learning. The environment generates observations and rewards in response to actions selected by the agent, making it more natural to think of the environment and agent as interactive programs. Sutton and Barto describe one prevalent view of agent-environment interactions in their introductory text (1998). Their view, shown in Figure 1, clearly separates the agent and environment into different components which interact in a particular way, following a particular sequence. observation ot reward rt Agent action at rt+1 Environment ot+1 Figure 1: Sutton and Barto’s agent-environment interface, with states generalized to observations. White’s RL-Glue Protocol (2006) formalizes Sutton and Barto’s interface for online, singleagent reinforcement learning. The RL-Glue Protocol describes how the different aspects of a reinforcement-learning experiment should be arranged into programs, and the etiquette they should follow when communicating with each other. These programs (Figure 2) are the agent, the environment, the experiment, and RL-Glue. The agent program implements the learning algorithm and action-selection mechanism. The environment program implements the dynamics of the task and generates the observations and rewards. The experiment program directs the experiment’s execution, including the sequence of agent-environment interactions and agent performance evaluation. The RL-Glue program mediates the communication between the agent and environment programs in response to commands from the experiment program. Our RL-Glue software (RL-Glue) implements White’s protocol.1 Experiment Program Agent Program RL-Glue Program Environment Program Figure 2: The four programs speciﬁed by the RL-Glue Protocol. Arrows indicate the direction of the ﬂow of control. RL-Glue can be used either in internal or external mode. In internal mode, the agent, environment and experiment are linked into a single program, and their communication is through function calls. Internal mode is currently an option if the agent, environment, and experiment are written exclusively in Java or C/C++. In external mode, the agent, environment and experiment are linked 1. This can be found at http://glue.rl-community.org/protocol. 2134 RL-G LUE into separate programs. Each program connects to the RL-Glue server program, and all communication is over TCP/IP socket connections. External mode allows these programs to be written in any programming language that supports socket communication. External mode is currently supported for C/C++, Java, Python, Lisp, and Matlab. Each mode has its strengths and weaknesses. Internal mode has less overhead, so it can execute more steps per second. External mode is more ﬂexible and portable. The performance difference between the two modes vanishes as the agent or environment becomes complex enough that computation dominates the socket overhead in terms of time per step. The agent and environment are indifferent and unaware of their execution mode; the difference in modes lies only in how the agent and environment are linked or loaded. 3. RL-Glue in Practice RL-Glue’s provides a common interface for a number of software and hardware projects in the reinforcement-learning community. For example, there is the annual RL-Competition, where teams from around the world compare their agents on a variety of challenging environments. The competition software uses the API, called RL-Viz, that is layered on top of RL-Glue to dynamically load agent and environment programs, modify parameters at runtime and visualize interaction and performance. All of the environments and sample agents created by the competition organizers are added to the RL-Library, a public, community-supported repository of RL-Glue compatible code. The RL-Library is also available as an archive of top competition agents, challenge problems, project code from academic publications, or any other RL-Glue compatible software that members of our community would like to share. The socket architecture of RL-Glue allows diverse software and hardware platforms to be connected as RL-Glue environment programs. There are ongoing projects that connect a mobile robot platform, a keepaway soccer server, a real-time strategy game, and an Atari emulator to RL-Glue. Our socket architecture helps lower the barriers for researchers wishing to work on larger scale environments by providing a simple and familiar interface. RL-Glue has been used for teaching reinforcement learning in several university courses and to create experiments for scientiﬁc articles published in leading conferences. See our RL-Glue in practice web page for an updated list of projects and papers that have used RL-Glue.2 4. Other Reinforcement-Learning Software Projects RL-Glue is not the ﬁrst software project that aims to standardize empirical reinforcement learning or to make agent and environment programs more accessible within our community. However, RLGlue is the only project that offers a standardized language-independent interface, rich actions and observations, and ﬁne-grained control of the experiment. Other projects, most notably: CLSquare,3 PIQLE,4 RL Toolbox,5 JRLF,6 and LibPG,7 offer signiﬁcant value to the reinforcement-learning community by offering agents and environments, 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.

Our design makes it relatively easy to interface existing frameworks with RL-Glue. We are currently offering our assistance in bridging other frameworks to RL-Glue, with the hope of improving access to all of these tools for all members of our community. 5. RL-Glue Open Source Project Website: http://glue.rl-community.org License: Apache 2.0 RL-Glue is more than an interface; it connects a family of community projects, with many levels of possible participation. Members of the community are invited to submit agent, environment and experiment programs to the RL-Library. Developers can also extend the reach of RL-Glue compatibility by writing external-mode or internal-mode interfaces for their favorite programming language. The RL-Glue software project also welcomes submissions and improvements for all parts of the software and documentation.

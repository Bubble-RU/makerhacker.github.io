<p>Author: Ting Hu, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Learning algorithms are based on samples which are often drawn independently from an identical distribution (i.i.d.). In this paper we consider a different setting with samples drawn according to a non-identical sequence of probability distributions. Each time a sample is drawn from a different distribution. In this setting we investigate a fully online learning algorithm associated with a general convex loss function and a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Error analysis is conducted under the assumption that the sequence of marginal distributions converges polynomially in the dual of a H¨ lder space. For regression with least square or insensitive loss, learning rates are given o in both the RKHS norm and the L2 norm. For classiﬁcation with hinge loss and support vector machine q-norm loss, rates are explicitly stated with respect to the excess misclassiﬁcation error.

<p>Author: Christian Rieger, Barbara Zwicknagl</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new technique for the analysis of kernel-based regression problems. The basic tools are sampling inequalities which apply to all machine learning problems involving penalty terms induced by kernels related to Sobolev spaces. They lead to explicit deterministic results concerning the worst case behaviour of ε- and ν-SVRs. Using these, we show how to adjust regularization parameters to get best possible approximation orders for regression. The results are illustrated by some numerical examples.

<p>Author: Jacob Abernethy, Francis Bach, Theodoros Evgeniou, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We present a general approach for collaborative ﬁltering (CF) using spectral regularization to learn linear operators mapping a set of “users” to a set of possibly desired “objects”. In particular, several recent low-rank type matrix-completion methods for CF are shown to be special cases of our proposed framework. Unlike existing regularization-based CF, our approach can be used to incorporate additional information such as attributes of the users/objects—a feature currently lacking in existing regularization-based CF approaches—using popular and well-known kernel methods. We provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods. We then provide learning algorithms based on low-rank decompositions and test them on a standard CF data set. The experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization-based CF methods to incorporate related information about users and objects. Finally, we show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases of our proposed approach.

<p>Author: Adam R. Klivans, Philip M. Long, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We give new algorithms for learning halfspaces in the challenging malicious noise model, where an adversary may corrupt both the labels and the underlying distribution of examples. Our algorithms can tolerate malicious noise rates exponentially larger than previous work in terms of the dependence on the dimension n, and succeed for the fairly broad class of all isotropic log-concave distributions. We give poly(n, 1/ε)-time algorithms for solving the following problems to accuracy ε: • Learning origin-centered halfspaces in Rn with respect to the uniform distribution on the unit ball with malicious noise rate η = Ω(ε2 / log(n/ε)). (The best previous result was Ω(ε/(n log(n/ε))1/4 ).) • Learning origin-centered halfspaces with respect to any isotropic logconcave distribution on Rn with malicious noise rate η = Ω(ε3 / log2 (n/ε)). This is the ﬁrst efﬁcient algorithm for learning under isotropic log-concave distributions in the presence of malicious noise. We also give a poly(n, 1/ε)-time algorithm for learning origin-centered halfspaces under any isotropic log-concave distribution on Rn in the presence of adversarial label noise at rate η = Ω(ε3 / log(1/ε)). In the adversarial label noise setting (or agnostic model), labels can be noisy, but not example points themselves. Previous results could handle η = Ω(ε) but had running time exponential in an unspeciﬁed function of 1/ε. Our analysis crucially exploits both concentration and anti-concentration properties of isotropic log-concave distributions. Our algorithms combine an iterative outlier removal procedure using Principal Component Analysis together with “smooth” boosting.

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the feature selection problem using a greedy least squares regression algorithm. We show that under a certain irrepresentable condition on the design matrix (but independent of the sparse target), the greedy algorithm can select features consistently when the sample size approaches inﬁnity. The condition is identical to a corresponding condition for Lasso. Moreover, under a sparse eigenvalue condition, the greedy algorithm can reliably identify features as long as each nonzero coefﬁcient is larger than a constant times the noise level. In compar√ ison, Lasso may require the coefﬁcients to be larger than O( s) times the noise level in the worst case, where s is the number of nonzero coefﬁcients.

<p>Author: David P. Helmbold, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We give an algorithm for the on-line learning of permutations. The algorithm maintains its uncertainty about the target permutation as a doubly stochastic weight matrix, and makes predictions using an efﬁcient method for decomposing the weight matrix into a convex combination of permutations. The weight matrix is updated by multiplying the current matrix entries by exponential factors, and an iterative procedure is needed to restore double stochasticity. Even though the result of this procedure does not have a closed form, a new analysis approach allows us to prove an optimal (up to small constant factors) bound on the regret of our algorithm. This regret bound is signiﬁcantly better than that of either Kalai and Vempala’s more efﬁcient Follow the Perturbed Leader algorithm or the computationally expensive method of explicitly representing each permutation as an expert.

<p>Author: Dao-Hong Xiang, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers binary classiﬁcation algorithms generated from Tikhonov regularization schemes associated with general convex loss functions and varying Gaussian kernels. Our main goal is to provide fast convergence rates for the excess misclassiﬁcation error. Allowing varying Gaussian kernels in the algorithms improves learning rates measured by regularization error and sample error. Special structures of Gaussian kernels enable us to construct, by a nice approximation scheme with a Fourier analysis technique, uniformly bounded regularizing functions achieving polynomial decays of the regularization error under a Sobolev smoothness condition. The sample error is estimated by using a projection operator and a tight bound for the covering numbers of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces generated by Gaussian kernels. The convexity of the general loss function plays a very important role in our analysis.

<p>Author: Ting Hu, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Learning algorithms are based on samples which are often drawn independently from an identical distribution (i.i.d.). In this paper we consider a different setting with samples drawn according to a non-identical sequence of probability distributions. Each time a sample is drawn from a different distribution. In this setting we investigate a fully online learning algorithm associated with a general convex loss function and a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Error analysis is conducted under the assumption that the sequence of marginal distributions converges polynomially in the dual of a H¨ lder space. For regression with least square or insensitive loss, learning rates are given o in both the RKHS norm and the L2 norm. For classiﬁcation with hinge loss and support vector machine q-norm loss, rates are explicitly stated with respect to the excess misclassiﬁcation error.

<p>Author: Jonathan Huang, Carlos Guestrin, Leonidas Guibas</p><p>Abstract: Permutations are ubiquitous in many real-world problems, such as voting, ranking, and data association. Representing uncertainty over permutations is challenging, since there are n! possibilities, and typical compact and factorized probability distribution representations, such as graphical models, cannot capture the mutual exclusivity constraints associated with permutations. In this paper, we use the “low-frequency” terms of a Fourier decomposition to represent distributions over permutations compactly. We present Kronecker conditioning, a novel approach for maintaining and updating these distributions directly in the Fourier domain, allowing for polynomial time bandlimited approximations. Low order Fourier-based approximations, however, may lead to functions that do not correspond to valid distributions. To address this problem, we present a quadratic program deﬁned directly in the Fourier domain for projecting the approximation onto a relaxation of the polytope of legal marginal distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real camera-based multi-person tracking scenario.

<p>Author: Brian Kulis, Mátyás A. Sustik, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study low-rank matrix nearness problems, with a focus on learning low-rank positive semideﬁnite (kernel) matrices for machine learning applications. We propose efﬁcient algorithms that scale linearly in the number of data points and quadratically in the rank of the input matrix. Existing algorithms for learning kernel matrices often scale poorly, with running times that are cubic in the number of data points. We employ Bregman matrix divergences as the measures of nearness—these divergences are natural for learning low-rank kernels since they preserve rank as well as positive semideﬁniteness. Special cases of our framework yield faster algorithms for various existing learning problems, and experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms can effectively learn both low-rank and full-rank kernel matrices.

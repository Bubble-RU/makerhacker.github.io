<p>Author: Steffen Bickel, Michael Brückner, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address classiﬁcation problems for which the training instances are governed by an input distribution that is allowed to differ arbitrarily from the test distribution—problems also referred to as classiﬁcation under covariate shift. We derive a solution that is purely discriminative: neither training nor test distribution are modeled explicitly. The problem of learning under covariate shift can be written as an integrated optimization problem. Instantiating the general optimization problem leads to a kernel logistic regression and an exponential model classiﬁer for covariate shift. The optimization problem is convex under certain conditions; our ﬁndings also clarify the relationship to the known kernel mean matching procedure. We report on experiments on problems of spam ﬁltering, text classiﬁcation, and landmine detection.

<p>Author: Emma Brunskill, Bethany R. Leffler, Lihong Li, Michael L. Littman, Nicholas Roy</p><p>Abstract: To quickly achieve good performance, reinforcement-learning algorithms for acting in large continuous-valued domains must use a representation that is both sufﬁciently powerful to capture important domain characteristics, and yet simultaneously allows generalization, or sharing, among experiences. Our algorithm balances this tradeoff by using a stochastic, switching, parametric dynamics representation. We argue that this model characterizes a number of signiﬁcant, real-world domains, such as robot navigation across varying terrain. We prove that this representational assumption allows our algorithm to be probably approximately correct with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with all problem-speciﬁc quantities including the state-space dimension. We also explicitly incorporate the error introduced by approximate planning in our sample complexity bounds, in contrast to prior Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Markov Decision Processes (MDP) approaches, which typically assume the estimated MDP can be solved exactly. Our experimental results on constructing plans for driving to work using real car trajectory data, as well as a small robot experiment on navigating varying terrain, demonstrate that our dynamics representation enables us to capture real-world dynamics in a sufﬁcient manner to produce good performance.

<p>Author: Brian Kulis, Mátyás A. Sustik, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study low-rank matrix nearness problems, with a focus on learning low-rank positive semideﬁnite (kernel) matrices for machine learning applications. We propose efﬁcient algorithms that scale linearly in the number of data points and quadratically in the rank of the input matrix. Existing algorithms for learning kernel matrices often scale poorly, with running times that are cubic in the number of data points. We employ Bregman matrix divergences as the measures of nearness—these divergences are natural for learning low-rank kernels since they preserve rank as well as positive semideﬁniteness. Special cases of our framework yield faster algorithms for various existing learning problems, and experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms can effectively learn both low-rank and full-rank kernel matrices.

<p>Author: Kristian Woodsend, Jacek Gondzio</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines are a powerful machine learning technology, but the training process involves a dense quadratic optimization problem and is computationally challenging. A parallel implementation of linear Support Vector Machine training has been developed, using a combination of MPI and OpenMP. Using an interior point method for the optimization and a reformulation that avoids the dense Hessian matrix, the structure of the augmented system matrix is exploited to partition data and computations amongst parallel processors efﬁciently. The new implementation has been applied to solve problems from the PASCAL Challenge on Large-scale Learning. We show that our approach is competitive, and is able to solve problems in the Challenge many times faster than other parallel approaches. We also demonstrate that the hybrid version performs more efﬁciently than the version using pure MPI.

<p>Author: Junhui Wang, Xiaotong Shen, Wei Pan</p><p>Abstract: In classiﬁcation, semisupervised learning usually involves a large amount of unlabeled data with only a small number of labeled data. This imposes a great challenge in that it is difﬁcult to achieve good classiﬁcation performance through labeled data alone. To leverage unlabeled data for enhancing classiﬁcation, this article introduces a large margin semisupervised learning method within the framework of regularization, based on an efﬁcient margin loss for unlabeled data, which seeks efﬁcient extraction of the information from unlabeled data for estimating the Bayes decision boundary for classiﬁcation. For implementation, an iterative scheme is derived through conditional expectations. Finally, theoretical and numerical analyses are conducted, in addition to an application to gene function prediction. They suggest that the proposed method enables to recover the performance of its supervised counterpart based on complete data in rates of convergence, when possible.

<p>Author: Jose M. Peña, Roland Nilsson, Johan Björkegren, Jesper Tegnér</p><p>Abstract: We present a sound and complete graphical criterion for reading dependencies from the minimal undirected independence map G of a graphoid M that satisﬁes weak transitivity. Here, complete means that it is able to read all the dependencies in M that can be derived by applying the graphoid properties and weak transitivity to the dependencies used in the construction of G and the independencies obtained from G by vertex separation. We argue that assuming weak transitivity is not too restrictive. As an intermediate step in the derivation of the graphical criterion, we prove that for any undirected graph G there exists a strictly positive discrete probability distribution with the prescribed sample spaces that is faithful to G. We also report an algorithm that implements the graphical criterion and whose running time is considered to be at most O(n2 (e + n)) for n nodes and e edges. Finally, we illustrate how the graphical criterion can be used within bioinformatics to identify biologically meaningful gene dependencies.

<p>Author: Halbert White, Karim Chalak</p><p>Abstract: Judea Pearl’s Causal Model is a rich framework that provides deep insight into the nature of causal relations. As yet, however, the Pearl Causal Model (PCM) has had a lesser impact on economics or econometrics than on other disciplines. This may be due in part to the fact that the PCM is not as well suited to analyzing structures that exhibit features of central interest to economists and econometricians: optimization, equilibrium, and learning. We offer the settable systems framework as an extension of the PCM that permits causal discourse in systems embodying optimization, equilibrium, and learning. Because these are common features of physical, natural, or social systems, our framework may prove generally useful for machine learning. Important features distinguishing the settable system framework from the PCM are its countable dimensionality and the use of partitioning and partition-speciﬁc response functions to accommodate the behavior of optimizing and interacting agents and to eliminate the requirement of a unique ﬁxed point for the system. Reﬁnements of the PCM include the settable systems treatment of attributes, the causal role of exogenous variables, and the dual role of variables as causes and responses. A series of closely related machine learning examples and examples from game theory and machine learning with feedback demonstrates some limitations of the PCM and motivates the distinguishing features of settable systems.

Le</p><p>Abstract: Consider the following problem: given sets of unlabeled observations, each set with known label proportions, predict the labels of another set of observations, possibly with known label proportions. This problem occurs in areas like e-commerce, politics, spam ﬁltering and improper content detection. We present consistent estimators which can reconstruct the correct labels with high probability in a uniform convergence sense. Experiments show that our method works well in practice.

<p>Author: Roberto Esposito, Daniele P. Radicioni</p><p>Abstract: The growth of information available to learning systems and the increasing complexity of learning tasks determine the need for devising algorithms that scale well with respect to all learning parameters. In the context of supervised sequential learning, the Viterbi algorithm plays a fundamental role, by allowing the evaluation of the best (most probable) sequence of labels with a time complexity linear in the number of time events, and quadratic in the number of labels. In this paper we propose CarpeDiem, a novel algorithm allowing the evaluation of the best possible sequence of labels with a sub-quadratic time complexity.1 We provide theoretical grounding together with solid empirical results supporting two chief facts. CarpeDiem always ﬁnds the optimal solution requiring, in most cases, only a small fraction of the time taken by the Viterbi algorithm; meantime, CarpeDiem is never asymptotically worse than the Viterbi algorithm, thus conﬁrming it as a sound replacement.

<p>Author: Luciana Ferrer, Kemal Sönmez, Elizabeth Shriberg</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for training support vector machine (SVM)-based classiﬁcation systems for combination with other classiﬁcation systems designed for the same task. Ideally, a new system should be designed such that, when combined with existing systems, the resulting performance is optimized. We present a simple model for this problem and use the understanding gained from this analysis to propose a method to achieve better combination performance when training SVM systems. We include a regularization term in the SVM objective function that aims to reduce the average class-conditional covariance between the resulting scores and the scores produced by the existing systems, introducing a trade-off between such covariance and the system’s individual performance. That is, the new system “takes one for the team”, falling somewhat short of its best possible performance in order to increase the diversity of the ensemble. We report results on the NIST 2005 and 2006 speaker recognition evaluations (SREs) for a variety of subsystems. We show a gain of 19% on the equal error rate (EER) of a combination of four systems when applying the proposed method with respect to the performance obtained when the four systems are trained independently of each other.

<p>Author: Luke K. McDowell, Kalyan Moy Gupta, David W. Aha</p><p>Abstract: Many collective classiﬁcation (CC) algorithms have been shown to increase accuracy when instances are interrelated. However, CC algorithms must be carefully applied because their use of estimated labels can in some cases decrease accuracy. In this article, we show that managing this label uncertainty through cautious algorithmic behavior is essential to achieving maximal, robust performance. First, we describe cautious inference and explain how four well-known families of CC algorithms can be parameterized to use varying degrees of such caution. Second, we introduce cautious learning and show how it can be used to improve the performance of almost any CC algorithm, with or without cautious inference. We then evaluate cautious inference and learning for the four collective inference families, with three local classiﬁers and a range of both synthetic and real-world data. We ﬁnd that cautious learning and cautious inference typically outperform less cautious approaches. In addition, we identify the data characteristics that predict more substantial performance differences. Our results reveal that the degree of caution used usually has a larger impact on performance than the choice of the underlying inference algorithm. Together, these results identify the most appropriate CC algorithms to use for particular task characteristics and explain multiple conﬂicting ﬁndings from prior CC research.

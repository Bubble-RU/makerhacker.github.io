<p>Author: Kilian Q. Weinberger, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: The accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁcation depends signiﬁcantly on the metric used to compute distances between different examples. In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classiﬁcation from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classiﬁcation using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modiﬁcation or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classiﬁcation. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semideﬁnite program. On several data sets of varying size and difﬁculty, we ﬁnd that metrics trained in this way lead to signiﬁcant improvements in kNN classiﬁcation. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.

<p>Author: Zeeshan Syed, Piotr Indyk, John Guttag</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an automated approach to discover patterns that can distinguish between sequences belonging to different labeled groups. Our method searches for approximately conserved motifs that occur with varying statistical properties in positive and negative training examples. We propose a two-step process to discover such patterns. Using locality sensitive hashing (LSH), we ﬁrst estimate the frequency of all subsequences and their approximate matches within a given Hamming radius in labeled examples. The discriminative ability of each pattern is then assessed from the estimated frequencies by concordance and rank sum testing. The use of LSH to identify approximate matches for each candidate pattern helps reduce the runtime of our method. Space requirements are reduced by decomposing the search problem into an iterative method that uses a single LSH table in memory. We propose two further optimizations to the search for discriminative patterns. Clustering with redundancy based on a 2-approximate solution of the k-center problem decreases the number of overlapping approximate groups while providing exhaustive coverage of the search space. Sequential statistical methods allow the search process to use data from only as many training examples as are needed to assess signiﬁcance. We evaluated our algorithm on data sets from different applications to discover sequential patterns for classiﬁcation. On nucleotide sequences from the Drosophila genome compared with random background sequences, our method was able to discover approximate binding sites that were preserved upstream of genes. We observed a similar result in experiments on ChIP-on-chip data. For cardiovascular data from patients admitted with acute coronary syndromes, our pattern discovery approach identiﬁed approximately conserved sequences of morphology variations that were predictive of future death in a test population.

<p>Author: Jie Chen, Haw-ren Fang, Yousef Saad</p><p>Abstract: Nearest neighbor graphs are widely used in data mining and machine learning. A brute-force method to compute the exact kNN graph takes Θ(dn2 ) time for n data points in the d dimensional Euclidean space. We propose two divide and conquer methods for computing an approximate kNN graph in Θ(dnt ) time for high dimensional data (large d). The exponent t ∈ (1, 2) is an increasing function of an internal parameter α which governs the size of the common region in the divide step. Experiments show that a high quality graph can usually be obtained with small overlaps, that is, for small values of t. A few of the practical details of the algorithms are as follows. First, the divide step uses an inexpensive Lanczos procedure to perform recursive spectral bisection. After each conquer step, an additional reﬁnement step is performed to improve the accuracy of the graph. Finally, a hash table is used to avoid repeating distance calculations during the divide and conquer process. The combination of these techniques is shown to yield quite effective algorithms for building kNN graphs.

<p>Author: Junhui Wang, Xiaotong Shen, Wei Pan</p><p>Abstract: In classiﬁcation, semisupervised learning usually involves a large amount of unlabeled data with only a small number of labeled data. This imposes a great challenge in that it is difﬁcult to achieve good classiﬁcation performance through labeled data alone. To leverage unlabeled data for enhancing classiﬁcation, this article introduces a large margin semisupervised learning method within the framework of regularization, based on an efﬁcient margin loss for unlabeled data, which seeks efﬁcient extraction of the information from unlabeled data for estimating the Bayes decision boundary for classiﬁcation. For implementation, an iterative scheme is derived through conditional expectations. Finally, theoretical and numerical analyses are conducted, in addition to an application to gene function prediction. They suggest that the proposed method enables to recover the performance of its supervised counterpart based on complete data in rates of convergence, when possible.

<p>Author: Marc Boullé</p><p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of computer storage capacities, available data and demand for scoring models both follow an increasing trend, sharper than that of the processing power. However, the main limitation to a wide spread of data mining solutions is the non-increasing availability of skilled data analysts, which play a key role in data preparation and model selection. In this paper, we present a parameter-free scalable classiﬁcation method, which is a step towards fully automatic data mining. The method is based on Bayes optimal univariate conditional density estimators, naive Bayes classiﬁcation enhanced with a Bayesian variable selection scheme, and averaging of models using a logarithmic smoothing of the posterior distribution. We focus on the complexity of the algorithms and show how they can cope with data sets that are far larger than the available central memory. We ﬁnally report results on the Large Scale Learning challenge, where our method obtains state of the art performance within practicable computation time.

<p>Author: Kilian Q. Weinberger, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: The accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁcation depends signiﬁcantly on the metric used to compute distances between different examples. In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classiﬁcation from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classiﬁcation using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modiﬁcation or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classiﬁcation. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semideﬁnite program. On several data sets of varying size and difﬁculty, we ﬁnd that metrics trained in this way lead to signiﬁcant improvements in kNN classiﬁcation. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.

<p>Author: Eugene Tuv, Alexander Borisov, George Runger, Kari Torkkola</p><p>Abstract: Predictive models beneﬁt from a compact, non-redundant subset of features that improves interpretability and generalization. Modern data sets are wide, dirty, mixed with both numerical and categorical predictors, and may contain interactive effects that require complex models. This is a challenge for ﬁlters, wrappers, and embedded feature selection methods. We describe details of an algorithm using tree-based ensembles to generate a compact subset of non-redundant features. Parallel and serial ensembles of trees are combined into a mixed method that can uncover masking and detect features of secondary effect. Simulated and actual examples illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

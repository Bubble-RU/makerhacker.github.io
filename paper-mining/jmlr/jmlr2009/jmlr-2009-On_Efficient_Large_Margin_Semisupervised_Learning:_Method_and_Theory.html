<p>Author: Steffen Bickel, Michael Brückner, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address classiﬁcation problems for which the training instances are governed by an input distribution that is allowed to differ arbitrarily from the test distribution—problems also referred to as classiﬁcation under covariate shift. We derive a solution that is purely discriminative: neither training nor test distribution are modeled explicitly. The problem of learning under covariate shift can be written as an integrated optimization problem. Instantiating the general optimization problem leads to a kernel logistic regression and an exponential model classiﬁer for covariate shift. The optimization problem is convex under certain conditions; our ﬁndings also clarify the relationship to the known kernel mean matching procedure. We report on experiments on problems of spam ﬁltering, text classiﬁcation, and landmine detection.

<p>Author: John Langford, Lihong Li, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of onlinelearning algorithms with convex loss functions. This method has several essential properties: 1. The degree of sparsity is continuous—a parameter controls the rate of sparsiﬁcation from no sparsiﬁcation to total sparsiﬁcation. 2. The approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1 -regularization method in the batch setting. We prove that small rates of sparsiﬁcation result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. 3. The approach works well empirically. We apply the approach to several data sets and ﬁnd for data sets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable.

<p>Author: Omid Madani, Michael Connor, Wiley Greiner</p><p>Abstract: Many learning tasks, such as large-scale text categorization and word prediction, can beneﬁt from efﬁcient training and classiﬁcation when the number of classes, in addition to instances and features, is large, that is, in the thousands and beyond. We investigate the learning of sparse class indices to address this challenge. An index is a mapping from features to classes. We compare the index-learning methods against other techniques, including one-versus-rest and top-down classiﬁcation using perceptrons and support vector machines. We ﬁnd that index learning is highly advantageous for space and time efﬁciency, at both training and classiﬁcation times. Moreover, this approach yields similar and at times better accuracies. On problems with hundreds of thousands of instances and thousands of classes, the index is learned in minutes, while other methods can take hours or days. As we explain, the design of the learning update enables conveniently constraining each feature to connect to a small subset of the classes in the index. This constraint is crucial for scalability. Given an instance with l active (positive-valued) features, each feature on average connecting to d classes in the index (in the order of 10s in our experiments), update and classiﬁcation take O(dl log(dl)).

<p>Author: Jean Hausser, Korbinian Strimmer</p><p>Abstract: We present a procedure for effective estimation of entropy and mutual information from smallsample data, and apply it to the problem of inferring high-dimensional gene association networks. SpeciÄ?Ĺš cally, we develop a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator, resulting in a procedure that is highly efÄ?Ĺš cient statistically as well as computationally. Despite its simplicity, we show that it outperforms eight other entropy estimation procedures across a diverse range of sampling scenarios and data-generating models, even in cases of severe undersampling. We illustrate the approach by analyzing E. coli gene expression data and computing an entropy-based gene-association network from gene expression data. A computer program is available that implements the proposed shrinkage estimator.

<p>Author: Jie Chen, Haw-ren Fang, Yousef Saad</p><p>Abstract: Nearest neighbor graphs are widely used in data mining and machine learning. A brute-force method to compute the exact kNN graph takes Θ(dn2 ) time for n data points in the d dimensional Euclidean space. We propose two divide and conquer methods for computing an approximate kNN graph in Θ(dnt ) time for high dimensional data (large d). The exponent t ∈ (1, 2) is an increasing function of an internal parameter α which governs the size of the common region in the divide step. Experiments show that a high quality graph can usually be obtained with small overlaps, that is, for small values of t. A few of the practical details of the algorithms are as follows. First, the divide step uses an inexpensive Lanczos procedure to perform recursive spectral bisection. After each conquer step, an additional reﬁnement step is performed to improve the accuracy of the graph. Finally, a hash table is used to avoid repeating distance calculations during the divide and conquer process. The combination of these techniques is shown to yield quite effective algorithms for building kNN graphs.

<p>Author: Marc Boullé</p><p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of computer storage capacities, available data and demand for scoring models both follow an increasing trend, sharper than that of the processing power. However, the main limitation to a wide spread of data mining solutions is the non-increasing availability of skilled data analysts, which play a key role in data preparation and model selection. In this paper, we present a parameter-free scalable classiﬁcation method, which is a step towards fully automatic data mining. The method is based on Bayes optimal univariate conditional density estimators, naive Bayes classiﬁcation enhanced with a Bayesian variable selection scheme, and averaging of models using a logarithmic smoothing of the posterior distribution. We focus on the complexity of the algorithms and show how they can cope with data sets that are far larger than the available central memory. We ﬁnally report results on the Large Scale Learning challenge, where our method obtains state of the art performance within practicable computation time.

<p>Author: Shie Mannor, John N. Tsitsiklis, Jia Yuan Yu</p><p>Abstract: We study online learning where a decision maker interacts with Nature with the objective of maximizing her long-term average reward subject to some sample path average constraints. We deﬁne the reward-in-hindsight as the highest reward the decision maker could have achieved, while satisfying the constraints, had she known Nature’s choices in advance. We show that in general the reward-in-hindsight is not attainable. The convex hull of the reward-in-hindsight function is, however, attainable. For the important case of a single constraint, the convex hull turns out to be the highest attainable function. Using a calibrated forecasting rule, we provide an explicit strategy that attains this convex hull. We also measure the performance of heuristic methods based on non-calibrated forecasters in experiments involving a CPU power management problem. Keywords: online learning, calibration, regret minimization, approachability</p><p>5 0.28464255 <a title="63-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2009-Analysis_of_Perceptron-Based_Active_Learning.html">9 jmlr-2009-Analysis of Perceptron-Based Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Sanjoy Dasgupta, Adam Tauman Kalai, Claire Monteleoni</p><p>Abstract: We start by showing that in an active learning setting, the Perceptron algorithm needs Ω( ε12 ) labels to learn linear separators within generalization error ε. We then present a simple active learning algorithm for this problem, which combines a modiﬁcation of the Perceptron update with an adaptive ﬁltering rule for deciding which points to query. For data distributed uniformly over the unit ˜ sphere, we show that our algorithm reaches generalization error ε after asking for just O(d log 1 ) ε labels. This exponential improvement over the usual sample complexity of supervised learning had previously been demonstrated only for the computationally more complex query-by-committee algorithm.

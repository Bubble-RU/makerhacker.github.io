<p>Author: Yuesheng Xu, Haizhang Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We continue our recent study on constructing a reﬁnement kernel for a given kernel so that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the reﬁnement kernel contains that with the original kernel as a subspace. To motivate this study, we ﬁrst develop a reﬁnement kernel method for learning, which gives an efﬁcient algorithm for updating a learning predictor. Several characterizations of reﬁnement kernels are then presented. It is shown that a nontrivial reﬁnement kernel for a given kernel always exists if the input space has an inﬁnite cardinal number. Reﬁnement kernels for translation invariant kernels and Hilbert-Schmidt kernels are investigated. Various concrete examples are provided.

<p>Author: Andreas Argyriou, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We consider a general class of regularization methods which learn a vector of parameters on the basis of linear measurements. It is well known that if the regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the L2 norm, then the learned vector is a linear combination of the input data. This result, known as the representer theorem, lies at the basis of kernel-based methods in machine learning. In this paper, we prove the necessity of the above condition, in the case of differentiable regularizers. We further extend our analysis to regularization methods which learn a matrix, a problem which is motivated by the application to multi-task learning. In this context, we study a more general representer theorem, which holds for a larger class of regularizers. We provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition characterizing this class of matrix regularizers and we highlight some concrete examples of practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles from matrix theory, especially the useful notion of matrix nondecreasing functions.

<p>Author: Jacob Abernethy, Francis Bach, Theodoros Evgeniou, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We present a general approach for collaborative ﬁltering (CF) using spectral regularization to learn linear operators mapping a set of “users” to a set of possibly desired “objects”. In particular, several recent low-rank type matrix-completion methods for CF are shown to be special cases of our proposed framework. Unlike existing regularization-based CF, our approach can be used to incorporate additional information such as attributes of the users/objects—a feature currently lacking in existing regularization-based CF approaches—using popular and well-known kernel methods. We provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods. We then provide learning algorithms based on low-rank decompositions and test them on a standard CF data set. The experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization-based CF methods to incorporate related information about users and objects. Finally, we show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases of our proposed approach.

<p>Author: Christian Rieger, Barbara Zwicknagl</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new technique for the analysis of kernel-based regression problems. The basic tools are sampling inequalities which apply to all machine learning problems involving penalty terms induced by kernels related to Sobolev spaces. They lead to explicit deterministic results concerning the worst case behaviour of ε- and ν-SVRs. Using these, we show how to adjust regularization parameters to get best possible approximation orders for regression. The results are illustrated by some numerical examples.

<p>Author: Thomas Abeel, Yves Van de Peer, Yvan Saeys</p><p>Abstract: Java-ML is a collection of machine learning and data mining algorithms, which aims to be a readily usable and easily extensible API for both software developers and research scientists. The interfaces for each type of algorithm are kept simple and algorithms strictly follow their respective interface. Comparing different classiﬁers or clustering algorithms is therefore straightforward, and implementing new algorithms is also easy. The implementations of the algorithms are clearly written, properly documented and can thus be used as a reference. The library is written in Java and is available from http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/ under the GNU GPL license.

Counterexamples are provided to show that the results do not hold under less restrictive conditions. Monotonic effects are furthermore used to relate signed edges on a causal directed acyclic graph to qualitative effect modiﬁcation. The theory is applied to an example concerning the direct effect of smoking on cardiovascular disease controlling for hypercholesterolemia. Monotonicity assumptions are used to construct a test for whether there is a variable that confounds the relationship between the mediator, hypercholesterolemia, and the outcome, cardiovascular disease.

<p>Author: Hui Li, Xuejun Liao, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) in multiple partially observable stochastic environments. We introduce the regionalized policy representation (RPR) to characterize the agent’s behavior in each environment. The RPR is a parametric model of the conditional distribution over current actions given the history of past actions and observations; the agent’s choice of actions is directly based on this conditional distribution, without an intervening model to characterize the environment itself. We propose off-policy batch algorithms to learn the parameters of the RPRs, using episodic data collected when following a behavior policy, and show their linkage to policy iteration. We employ the Dirichlet process as a nonparametric prior over the RPRs across multiple environments. The intrinsic clustering property of the Dirichlet process imposes sharing of episodes among similar environments, which effectively reduces the number of episodes required for learning a good policy in each environment, when data sharing is appropriate. The number of distinct RPRs and the associated clusters (the sharing patterns) are automatically discovered by exploiting the episodic data as well as the nonparametric nature of the Dirichlet process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RPR as well as the RPR-based MTRL framework on various problems, including grid-world navigation and multi-aspect target classiﬁcation. The experimental results show that the RPR is a competitive reinforcement learning algorithm in partially observable domains, and the MTRL consistently achieves better performance than single task reinforcement learning.

<p>Author: Haizhang Zhang, Yuesheng Xu, Jun Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the notion of reproducing kernel Banach spaces (RKBS) and study special semiinner-product RKBS by making use of semi-inner-products and the duality mapping. Properties of an RKBS and its reproducing kernel are investigated. As applications, we develop in the framework of RKBS standard learning schemes including minimal norm interpolation, regularization network, support vector machines, and kernel principal component analysis. In particular, existence, uniqueness and representer theorems are established.

<p>Author: Jan Ramon, Siegfried Nijssen</p><p>Abstract: Algorithms that list graphs such that no two listed graphs are isomorphic, are important building blocks of systems for mining and learning in graphs. Algorithms are already known that solve this problem efﬁciently for many classes of graphs of restricted topology, such as trees. In this article we introduce the concept of a dense augmentation schema, and introduce an algorithm that can be used to enumerate any class of graphs with polynomial delay, as long as the class of graphs can be described using a monotonic predicate operating on a dense augmentation schema. In practice this means that this is the ﬁrst enumeration algorithm that can be applied theoretically efﬁciently in any frequent subgraph mining algorithm, and that this algorithm generalizes to situations beyond the standard frequent subgraph mining setting. Keywords: graph mining, enumeration, monotonic graph classes</p><p>6 0.6806339 <a title="80-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2009-Markov_Properties_for_Linear_Causal_Models_with_Correlated_Errors%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%28Special_Topic_on_Causality%29.html">54 jmlr-2009-Markov Properties for Linear Causal Models with Correlated Errors    (Special Topic on Causality)</a></p>

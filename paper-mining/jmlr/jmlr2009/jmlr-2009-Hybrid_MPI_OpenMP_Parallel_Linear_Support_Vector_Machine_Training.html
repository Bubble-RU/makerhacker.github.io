<p>Author: Antoine Bordes, Léon Bottou, Patrick Gallinari</p><p>Abstract: The SGD-QN algorithm is a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that makes careful use of secondorder information and splits the parameter update into independently scheduled components. Thanks to this design, SGD-QN iterates nearly as fast as a ﬁrst-order stochastic gradient descent but requires less iterations to achieve the same accuracy. This algorithm won the “Wild Track” of the ﬁrst PASCAL Large Scale Learning Challenge (Sonnenburg et al., 2008).

<p>Author: Vojtěch Franc, Sören Sonnenburg</p><p>Abstract: We have developed an optimized cutting plane algorithm (OCA) for solving large-scale risk minimization problems. We prove that the number of iterations OCA requires to converge to a ε precise solution is approximately linear in the sample size. We also derive OCAS, an OCA-based linear binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) solver, and OCAM, a linear multi-class SVM solver. In an extensive empirical evaluation we show that OCAS outperforms current state-of-the-art SVM solvers like SVMlight , SVMperf and BMRM, achieving speedup factor more than 1,200 over SVMlight on some data sets and speedup factor of 29 over SVMperf , while obtaining the same precise support vector solution. OCAS, even in the early optimization steps, often shows faster convergence than the currently prevailing approximative methods in this domain, SGD and Pegasos. In addition, our proposed linear multi-class SVM solver, OCAM, achieves speedups of factor of up to 10 compared to SVMmulti−class . Finally, we use OCAS and OCAM in two real-world applications, the problem of human acceptor splice site detection and malware detection. Effectively parallelizing OCAS, we achieve state-of-the-art results on an acceptor splice site recognition problem only by being able to learn from all the available 50 million examples in a 12-million-dimensional feature space.

<p>Author: Pradip Ghanty, Samrat Paul, Nikhil R. Pal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new multilayer classiﬁer architecture. The proposed hybrid architecture has two cascaded modules: feature extraction module and classiﬁcation module. In the feature extraction module we use the multilayered perceptron (MLP) neural networks, although other tools such as radial basis function (RBF) networks can be used. In the classiﬁcation module we use support vector machines (SVMs)—here also other tool such as MLP or RBF can be used. The feature extraction module has several sub-modules each of which is expected to extract features capturing the discriminating characteristics of different areas of the input space. The classiﬁcation module classiﬁes the data based on the extracted features. The resultant architecture with MLP in feature extraction module and SVM in classiﬁcation module is called NEUROSVM. The NEUROSVM is tested on twelve benchmark data sets and the performance of the NEUROSVM is found to be better than both MLP and SVM. We also compare the performance of proposed architecture with that of two ensemble methods: majority voting and averaging. Here also the NEUROSVM is found to perform better than these two ensemble methods. Further we explore the use of MLP and RBF in the classiﬁcation module of the proposed architecture. The most attractive feature of NEUROSVM is that it practically eliminates the severe dependency of SVM on the choice of kernel. This has been veriﬁed with respect to both linear and non-linear kernels. We have also demonstrated that for the feature extraction module, the full training of MLPs is not needed.

<p>Author: Kristian Woodsend, Jacek Gondzio</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines are a powerful machine learning technology, but the training process involves a dense quadratic optimization problem and is computationally challenging. A parallel implementation of linear Support Vector Machine training has been developed, using a combination of MPI and OpenMP. Using an interior point method for the optimization and a reformulation that avoids the dense Hessian matrix, the structure of the augmented system matrix is exploited to partition data and computations amongst parallel processors efﬁciently. The new implementation has been applied to solve problems from the PASCAL Challenge on Large-scale Learning. We show that our approach is competitive, and is able to solve problems in the Challenge many times faster than other parallel approaches. We also demonstrate that the hybrid version performs more efﬁciently than the version using pure MPI.

<p>Author: Adam R. Klivans, Philip M. Long, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We give new algorithms for learning halfspaces in the challenging malicious noise model, where an adversary may corrupt both the labels and the underlying distribution of examples. Our algorithms can tolerate malicious noise rates exponentially larger than previous work in terms of the dependence on the dimension n, and succeed for the fairly broad class of all isotropic log-concave distributions. We give poly(n, 1/ε)-time algorithms for solving the following problems to accuracy ε: • Learning origin-centered halfspaces in Rn with respect to the uniform distribution on the unit ball with malicious noise rate η = Ω(ε2 / log(n/ε)). (The best previous result was Ω(ε/(n log(n/ε))1/4 ).) • Learning origin-centered halfspaces with respect to any isotropic logconcave distribution on Rn with malicious noise rate η = Ω(ε3 / log2 (n/ε)). This is the ﬁrst efﬁcient algorithm for learning under isotropic log-concave distributions in the presence of malicious noise. We also give a poly(n, 1/ε)-time algorithm for learning origin-centered halfspaces under any isotropic log-concave distribution on Rn in the presence of adversarial label noise at rate η = Ω(ε3 / log(1/ε)). In the adversarial label noise setting (or agnostic model), labels can be noisy, but not example points themselves. Previous results could handle η = Ω(ε) but had running time exponential in an unspeciﬁed function of 1/ε. Our analysis crucially exploits both concentration and anti-concentration properties of isotropic log-concave distributions. Our algorithms combine an iterative outlier removal procedure using Principal Component Analysis together with “smooth” boosting.

<p>Author: Antoine Bordes, Léon Bottou, Patrick Gallinari</p><p>Abstract: The SGD-QN algorithm is a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that makes careful use of secondorder information and splits the parameter update into independently scheduled components. Thanks to this design, SGD-QN iterates nearly as fast as a ﬁrst-order stochastic gradient descent but requires less iterations to achieve the same accuracy. This algorithm won the “Wild Track” of the ﬁrst PASCAL Large Scale Learning Challenge (Sonnenburg et al., 2008).

<p>Author: Marc Boullé</p><p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of computer storage capacities, available data and demand for scoring models both follow an increasing trend, sharper than that of the processing power. However, the main limitation to a wide spread of data mining solutions is the non-increasing availability of skilled data analysts, which play a key role in data preparation and model selection. In this paper, we present a parameter-free scalable classiﬁcation method, which is a step towards fully automatic data mining. The method is based on Bayes optimal univariate conditional density estimators, naive Bayes classiﬁcation enhanced with a Bayesian variable selection scheme, and averaging of models using a logarithmic smoothing of the posterior distribution. We focus on the complexity of the algorithms and show how they can cope with data sets that are far larger than the available central memory. We ﬁnally report results on the Large Scale Learning challenge, where our method obtains state of the art performance within practicable computation time.

<p>Author: David Newman, Arthur Asuncion, Padhraic Smyth, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: We describe distributed algorithms for two widely-used topic models, namely the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, and the Hierarchical Dirichet Process (HDP) model. In our distributed algorithms the data is partitioned across separate processors and inference is done in a parallel, distributed fashion. We propose two distributed algorithms for LDA. The ﬁrst algorithm is a straightforward mapping of LDA to a distributed processor setting. In this algorithm processors concurrently perform Gibbs sampling over local data followed by a global update of topic counts. The algorithm is simple to implement and can be viewed as an approximation to Gibbs-sampled LDA. The second version is a model that uses a hierarchical Bayesian extension of LDA to directly account for distributed data. This model has a theoretical guarantee of convergence but is more complex to implement than the ﬁrst algorithm. Our distributed algorithm for HDP takes the straightforward mapping approach, and merges newly-created topics either by matching or by topic-id. Using ﬁve real-world text corpora we show that distributed learning works well in practice. For both LDA and HDP, we show that the converged test-data log probability for distributed learning is indistinguishable from that obtained with single-processor learning. Our extensive experimental results include learning topic models for two multi-million document collections using a 1024-processor parallel computer.

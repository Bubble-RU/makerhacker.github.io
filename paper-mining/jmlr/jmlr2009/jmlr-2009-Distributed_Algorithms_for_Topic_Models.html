<p>Author: Kilian Q. Weinberger, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: The accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁcation depends signiﬁcantly on the metric used to compute distances between different examples. In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classiﬁcation from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classiﬁcation using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modiﬁcation or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classiﬁcation. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semideﬁnite program. On several data sets of varying size and difﬁculty, we ﬁnd that metrics trained in this way lead to signiﬁcant improvements in kNN classiﬁcation. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.

<p>Author: Ulrich Paquet, Ole Winther, Manfred Opper</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian inference is intractable for many interesting models, making deterministic algorithms for approximate inference highly desirable. Unlike stochastic methods, which are exact in the limit, the accuracy of these approaches cannot be reasonably judged. In this paper we show how low order perturbation corrections to an expectation-consistent (EC) approximation can provide the necessary tools to ameliorate inference accuracy, and to give an indication of the quality of approximation without having to resort to Monte Carlo methods. Further comparisons are given with variational Bayes and parallel tempering (PT) combined with thermodynamic integration on a Gaussian mixture model. To obtain practical results we further generalize PT to temper from arbitrary distributions rather than a prior in Bayesian inference.

<p>Author: Kristian Woodsend, Jacek Gondzio</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines are a powerful machine learning technology, but the training process involves a dense quadratic optimization problem and is computationally challenging. A parallel implementation of linear Support Vector Machine training has been developed, using a combination of MPI and OpenMP. Using an interior point method for the optimization and a reformulation that avoids the dense Hessian matrix, the structure of the augmented system matrix is exploited to partition data and computations amongst parallel processors efﬁciently. The new implementation has been applied to solve problems from the PASCAL Challenge on Large-scale Learning. We show that our approach is competitive, and is able to solve problems in the Challenge many times faster than other parallel approaches. We also demonstrate that the hybrid version performs more efﬁciently than the version using pure MPI.

<p>Author: Babak Shahbaba, Radford Neal</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new nonlinear model for classiﬁcation, in which we model the joint distribution of response variable, y, and covariates, x, non-parametrically using Dirichlet process mixtures. We keep the relationship between y and x linear within each component of the mixture. The overall relationship becomes nonlinear if the mixture contains more than one component, with different regression coefﬁcients. We use simulated data to compare the performance of this new approach to alternative methods such as multinomial logit (MNL) models, decision trees, and support vector machines. We also evaluate our approach on two classiﬁcation problems: identifying the folding class of protein sequences and detecting Parkinson’s disease. Our model can sometimes improve predictive accuracy. Moreover, by grouping observations into sub-populations (i.e., mixture components), our model can sometimes provide insight into hidden structure in the data.

<p>Author: Luciana Ferrer, Kemal Sönmez, Elizabeth Shriberg</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for training support vector machine (SVM)-based classiﬁcation systems for combination with other classiﬁcation systems designed for the same task. Ideally, a new system should be designed such that, when combined with existing systems, the resulting performance is optimized. We present a simple model for this problem and use the understanding gained from this analysis to propose a method to achieve better combination performance when training SVM systems. We include a regularization term in the SVM objective function that aims to reduce the average class-conditional covariance between the resulting scores and the scores produced by the existing systems, introducing a trade-off between such covariance and the system’s individual performance. That is, the new system “takes one for the team”, falling somewhat short of its best possible performance in order to increase the diversity of the ensemble. We report results on the NIST 2005 and 2006 speaker recognition evaluations (SREs) for a variety of subsystems. We show a gain of 19% on the equal error rate (EER) of a combination of four systems when applying the proposed method with respect to the performance obtained when the four systems are trained independently of each other. Keywords: system combination, ensemble diversity, multiple classiﬁer systems, support vector machines, speaker recognition, kernel methods ∗.

<p>Author: David Newman, Arthur Asuncion, Padhraic Smyth, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: We describe distributed algorithms for two widely-used topic models, namely the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, and the Hierarchical Dirichet Process (HDP) model. In our distributed algorithms the data is partitioned across separate processors and inference is done in a parallel, distributed fashion. We propose two distributed algorithms for LDA. The ﬁrst algorithm is a straightforward mapping of LDA to a distributed processor setting. In this algorithm processors concurrently perform Gibbs sampling over local data followed by a global update of topic counts. The algorithm is simple to implement and can be viewed as an approximation to Gibbs-sampled LDA. The second version is a model that uses a hierarchical Bayesian extension of LDA to directly account for distributed data. This model has a theoretical guarantee of convergence but is more complex to implement than the ﬁrst algorithm. Our distributed algorithm for HDP takes the straightforward mapping approach, and merges newly-created topics either by matching or by topic-id. Using ﬁve real-world text corpora we show that distributed learning works well in practice. For both LDA and HDP, we show that the converged test-data log probability for distributed learning is indistinguishable from that obtained with single-processor learning. Our extensive experimental results include learning topic models for two multi-million document collections using a 1024-processor parallel computer.

<p>Author: Eugene Tuv, Alexander Borisov, George Runger, Kari Torkkola</p><p>Abstract: Predictive models beneﬁt from a compact, non-redundant subset of features that improves interpretability and generalization. Modern data sets are wide, dirty, mixed with both numerical and categorical predictors, and may contain interactive effects that require complex models. This is a challenge for ﬁlters, wrappers, and embedded feature selection methods. We describe details of an algorithm using tree-based ensembles to generate a compact subset of non-redundant features. Parallel and serial ensembles of trees are combined into a mixed method that can uncover masking and detect features of secondary effect. Simulated and actual examples illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

<p>Author: Vojtěch Franc, Sören Sonnenburg</p><p>Abstract: We have developed an optimized cutting plane algorithm (OCA) for solving large-scale risk minimization problems. We prove that the number of iterations OCA requires to converge to a ε precise solution is approximately linear in the sample size. We also derive OCAS, an OCA-based linear binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) solver, and OCAM, a linear multi-class SVM solver. In an extensive empirical evaluation we show that OCAS outperforms current state-of-the-art SVM solvers like SVMlight , SVMperf and BMRM, achieving speedup factor more than 1,200 over SVMlight on some data sets and speedup factor of 29 over SVMperf , while obtaining the same precise support vector solution. OCAS, even in the early optimization steps, often shows faster convergence than the currently prevailing approximative methods in this domain, SGD and Pegasos. In addition, our proposed linear multi-class SVM solver, OCAM, achieves speedups of factor of up to 10 compared to SVMmulti−class . Finally, we use OCAS and OCAM in two real-world applications, the problem of human acceptor splice site detection and malware detection. Effectively parallelizing OCAS, we achieve state-of-the-art results on an acceptor splice site recognition problem only by being able to learn from all the available 50 million examples in a 12-million-dimensional feature space.

<p>Author: John Langford, Lihong Li, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of onlinelearning algorithms with convex loss functions. This method has several essential properties: 1. The degree of sparsity is continuous—a parameter controls the rate of sparsiﬁcation from no sparsiﬁcation to total sparsiﬁcation. 2. The approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1 -regularization method in the batch setting. We prove that small rates of sparsiﬁcation result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. 3. The approach works well empirically. We apply the approach to several data sets and ﬁnd for data sets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable.

<p>Author: Marc Boullé</p><p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of computer storage capacities, available data and demand for scoring models both follow an increasing trend, sharper than that of the processing power. However, the main limitation to a wide spread of data mining solutions is the non-increasing availability of skilled data analysts, which play a key role in data preparation and model selection. In this paper, we present a parameter-free scalable classiﬁcation method, which is a step towards fully automatic data mining. The method is based on Bayes optimal univariate conditional density estimators, naive Bayes classiﬁcation enhanced with a Bayesian variable selection scheme, and averaging of models using a logarithmic smoothing of the posterior distribution. We focus on the complexity of the algorithms and show how they can cope with data sets that are far larger than the available central memory. We ﬁnally report results on the Large Scale Learning challenge, where our method obtains state of the art performance within practicable computation time.

<p>Author: Roberto Esposito, Daniele P. Radicioni</p><p>Abstract: The growth of information available to learning systems and the increasing complexity of learning tasks determine the need for devising algorithms that scale well with respect to all learning parameters. In the context of supervised sequential learning, the Viterbi algorithm plays a fundamental role, by allowing the evaluation of the best (most probable) sequence of labels with a time complexity linear in the number of time events, and quadratic in the number of labels. In this paper we propose CarpeDiem, a novel algorithm allowing the evaluation of the best possible sequence of labels with a sub-quadratic time complexity.1 We provide theoretical grounding together with solid empirical results supporting two chief facts. CarpeDiem always ﬁnds the optimal solution requiring, in most cases, only a small fraction of the time taken by the Viterbi algorithm; meantime, CarpeDiem is never asymptotically worse than the Viterbi algorithm, thus conﬁrming it as a sound replacement.

<p>Author: Omid Madani, Michael Connor, Wiley Greiner</p><p>Abstract: Many learning tasks, such as large-scale text categorization and word prediction, can beneﬁt from efﬁcient training and classiﬁcation when the number of classes, in addition to instances and features, is large, that is, in the thousands and beyond. We investigate the learning of sparse class indices to address this challenge. An index is a mapping from features to classes. We compare the index-learning methods against other techniques, including one-versus-rest and top-down classiﬁcation using perceptrons and support vector machines. We ﬁnd that index learning is highly advantageous for space and time efﬁciency, at both training and classiﬁcation times. Moreover, this approach yields similar and at times better accuracies. On problems with hundreds of thousands of instances and thousands of classes, the index is learned in minutes, while other methods can take hours or days. As we explain, the design of the learning update enables conveniently constraining each feature to connect to a small subset of the classes in the index. This constraint is crucial for scalability. Given an instance with l active (positive-valued) features, each feature on average connecting to d classes in the index (in the order of 10s in our experiments), update and classiﬁcation take O(dl log(dl)).

<p>Author: Steffen Bickel, Michael Brückner, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address classiﬁcation problems for which the training instances are governed by an input distribution that is allowed to differ arbitrarily from the test distribution—problems also referred to as classiﬁcation under covariate shift. We derive a solution that is purely discriminative: neither training nor test distribution are modeled explicitly. The problem of learning under covariate shift can be written as an integrated optimization problem. Instantiating the general optimization problem leads to a kernel logistic regression and an exponential model classiﬁer for covariate shift. The optimization problem is convex under certain conditions; our ﬁndings also clarify the relationship to the known kernel mean matching procedure. We report on experiments on problems of spam ﬁltering, text classiﬁcation, and landmine detection.

<p>Author: Emma Brunskill, Bethany R. Leffler, Lihong Li, Michael L. Littman, Nicholas Roy</p><p>Abstract: To quickly achieve good performance, reinforcement-learning algorithms for acting in large continuous-valued domains must use a representation that is both sufﬁciently powerful to capture important domain characteristics, and yet simultaneously allows generalization, or sharing, among experiences. Our algorithm balances this tradeoff by using a stochastic, switching, parametric dynamics representation. We argue that this model characterizes a number of signiﬁcant, real-world domains, such as robot navigation across varying terrain. We prove that this representational assumption allows our algorithm to be probably approximately correct with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with all problem-speciﬁc quantities including the state-space dimension. We also explicitly incorporate the error introduced by approximate planning in our sample complexity bounds, in contrast to prior Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Markov Decision Processes (MDP) approaches, which typically assume the estimated MDP can be solved exactly. Our experimental results on constructing plans for driving to work using real car trajectory data, as well as a small robot experiment on navigating varying terrain, demonstrate that our dynamics representation enables us to capture real-world dynamics in a sufﬁcient manner to produce good performance.

<p>Author: Luke K. McDowell, Kalyan Moy Gupta, David W. Aha</p><p>Abstract: Many collective classiﬁcation (CC) algorithms have been shown to increase accuracy when instances are interrelated. However, CC algorithms must be carefully applied because their use of estimated labels can in some cases decrease accuracy. In this article, we show that managing this label uncertainty through cautious algorithmic behavior is essential to achieving maximal, robust performance. First, we describe cautious inference and explain how four well-known families of CC algorithms can be parameterized to use varying degrees of such caution. Second, we introduce cautious learning and show how it can be used to improve the performance of almost any CC algorithm, with or without cautious inference. We then evaluate cautious inference and learning for the four collective inference families, with three local classiﬁers and a range of both synthetic and real-world data. We ﬁnd that cautious learning and cautious inference typically outperform less cautious approaches. In addition, we identify the data characteristics that predict more substantial performance differences. Our results reveal that the degree of caution used usually has a larger impact on performance than the choice of the underlying inference algorithm. Together, these results identify the most appropriate CC algorithms to use for particular task characteristics and explain multiple conﬂicting ﬁndings from prior CC research.

<p>Author: Raanan Yehezkel, Boaz Lerner</p><p>Abstract: We propose the recursive autonomy identiﬁcation (RAI) algorithm for constraint-based (CB) Bayesian network structure learning. The RAI algorithm learns the structure by sequential application of conditional independence (CI) tests, edge direction and structure decomposition into autonomous sub-structures. The sequence of operations is performed recursively for each autonomous substructure while simultaneously increasing the order of the CI test. While other CB algorithms d-separate structures and then direct the resulted undirected graph, the RAI algorithm combines the two processes from the outset and along the procedure. By this means and due to structure decomposition, learning a structure using RAI requires a smaller number of CI tests of high orders. This reduces the complexity and run-time of the algorithm and increases the accuracy by diminishing the curse-of-dimensionality. When the RAI algorithm learned structures from databases representing synthetic problems, known networks and natural problems, it demonstrated superiority with respect to computational complexity, run-time, structural correctness and classiﬁcation accuracy over the PC, Three Phase Dependency Analysis, Optimal Reinsertion, greedy search, Greedy Equivalence Search, Sparse Candidate, and Max-Min Hill-Climbing algorithms.

<p>Author: Raanan Yehezkel, Boaz Lerner</p><p>Abstract: We propose the recursive autonomy identiﬁcation (RAI) algorithm for constraint-based (CB) Bayesian network structure learning. The RAI algorithm learns the structure by sequential application of conditional independence (CI) tests, edge direction and structure decomposition into autonomous sub-structures. The sequence of operations is performed recursively for each autonomous substructure while simultaneously increasing the order of the CI test. While other CB algorithms d-separate structures and then direct the resulted undirected graph, the RAI algorithm combines the two processes from the outset and along the procedure. By this means and due to structure decomposition, learning a structure using RAI requires a smaller number of CI tests of high orders. This reduces the complexity and run-time of the algorithm and increases the accuracy by diminishing the curse-of-dimensionality. When the RAI algorithm learned structures from databases representing synthetic problems, known networks and natural problems, it demonstrated superiority with respect to computational complexity, run-time, structural correctness and classiﬁcation accuracy over the PC, Three Phase Dependency Analysis, Optimal Reinsertion, greedy search, Greedy Equivalence Search, Sparse Candidate, and Max-Min Hill-Climbing algorithms.

<p>Author: Yuehua Xu, Alan Fern, Sungwook Yoon</p><p>Abstract: Beam search is commonly used to help maintain tractability in large search spaces at the expense of completeness and optimality. Here we study supervised learning of linear ranking functions for controlling beam search. The goal is to learn ranking functions that allow for beam search to perform nearly as well as unconstrained search, and hence gain computational efﬁciency without seriously sacriﬁcing optimality. In this paper, we develop theoretical aspects of this learning problem and investigate the application of this framework to learning in the context of automated planning. We ﬁrst study the computational complexity of the learning problem, showing that even for exponentially large search spaces the general consistency problem is in NP. We also identify tractable and intractable subclasses of the learning problem, giving insight into the problem structure. Next, we analyze the convergence of recently proposed and modiﬁed online learning algorithms, where we introduce several notions of problem margin that imply convergence for the various algorithms. Finally, we present empirical results in automated planning, where ranking functions are learned to guide beam search in a number of benchmark planning domains. The results show that our approach is often able to outperform an existing state-of-the-art planning heuristic as well as a recent approach to learning such heuristics.

<p>Author: Alexander L. Strehl, Lihong Li, Michael L. Littman</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning near-optimal behavior in ﬁnite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a polynomial number of samples. These “PAC-MDP” algorithms include the wellknown E3 and R-MAX algorithms as well as the more recent Delayed Q-learning algorithm. We summarize the current state-of-the-art by presenting bounds for the problem in a uniﬁed theoretical framework. A more reﬁned analysis for upper and lower bounds is presented to yield insight into the differences between the model-free Delayed Q-learning and the model-based R-MAX.

<p>Author: Roberto Esposito, Daniele P. Radicioni</p><p>Abstract: The growth of information available to learning systems and the increasing complexity of learning tasks determine the need for devising algorithms that scale well with respect to all learning parameters. In the context of supervised sequential learning, the Viterbi algorithm plays a fundamental role, by allowing the evaluation of the best (most probable) sequence of labels with a time complexity linear in the number of time events, and quadratic in the number of labels. In this paper we propose CarpeDiem, a novel algorithm allowing the evaluation of the best possible sequence of labels with a sub-quadratic time complexity.1 We provide theoretical grounding together with solid empirical results supporting two chief facts. CarpeDiem always ﬁnds the optimal solution requiring, in most cases, only a small fraction of the time taken by the Viterbi algorithm; meantime, CarpeDiem is never asymptotically worse than the Viterbi algorithm, thus conﬁrming it as a sound replacement.

<p>Author: Zeeshan Syed, Piotr Indyk, John Guttag</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an automated approach to discover patterns that can distinguish between sequences belonging to different labeled groups. Our method searches for approximately conserved motifs that occur with varying statistical properties in positive and negative training examples. We propose a two-step process to discover such patterns. Using locality sensitive hashing (LSH), we ﬁrst estimate the frequency of all subsequences and their approximate matches within a given Hamming radius in labeled examples. The discriminative ability of each pattern is then assessed from the estimated frequencies by concordance and rank sum testing. The use of LSH to identify approximate matches for each candidate pattern helps reduce the runtime of our method. Space requirements are reduced by decomposing the search problem into an iterative method that uses a single LSH table in memory. We propose two further optimizations to the search for discriminative patterns. Clustering with redundancy based on a 2-approximate solution of the k-center problem decreases the number of overlapping approximate groups while providing exhaustive coverage of the search space. Sequential statistical methods allow the search process to use data from only as many training examples as are needed to assess signiﬁcance. We evaluated our algorithm on data sets from different applications to discover sequential patterns for classiﬁcation. On nucleotide sequences from the Drosophila genome compared with random background sequences, our method was able to discover approximate binding sites that were preserved upstream of genes. We observed a similar result in experiments on ChIP-on-chip data. For cardiovascular data from patients admitted with acute coronary syndromes, our pattern discovery approach identiﬁed approximately conserved sequences of morphology variations that were predictive of future death in a test population. Our data showed that the use of LSH, clustering, and sequential statistic</p><p>6 0.31696722 <a title="47-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2009-Feature_Selection_with_Ensembles%2C_Artificial_Variables%2C_and_Redundancy_Elimination%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%28Special_Topic_on_Model_Selection%29.html">35 jmlr-2009-Feature Selection with Ensembles, Artificial Variables, and Redundancy Elimination    (Special Topic on Model Selection)</a></p>

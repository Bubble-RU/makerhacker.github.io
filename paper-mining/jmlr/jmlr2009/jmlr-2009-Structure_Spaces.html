<p>Author: Barnabás Póczos, András Lőrincz</p><p>Abstract: We introduce novel online Bayesian methods for the identiﬁcation of a family of noisy recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We present Bayesian active learning techniques for stimulus selection given past experiences. In particular, we consider the unknown parameters as stochastic variables and use A-optimality and D-optimality principles to choose optimal stimuli. We derive myopic cost functions in order to maximize the information gain concerning network parameters at each time step. We also derive the A-optimal and D-optimal estimations of the additive noise that perturbs the dynamical system of the RNN. Here we investigate myopic as well as non-myopic estimations, and study the problem of simultaneous estimation of both the system parameters and the noise. Employing conjugate priors our derivations remain approximation-free and give rise to simple update rules for the online learning of the parameters. The efﬁciency of our method is demonstrated for a number of selected cases, including the task of controlled independent component analysis.

<p>Author: Sanjoy Dasgupta, Adam Tauman Kalai, Claire Monteleoni</p><p>Abstract: We start by showing that in an active learning setting, the Perceptron algorithm needs Ω( ε12 ) labels to learn linear separators within generalization error ε. We then present a simple active learning algorithm for this problem, which combines a modiﬁcation of the Perceptron update with an adaptive ﬁltering rule for deciding which points to query. For data distributed uniformly over the unit ˜ sphere, we show that our algorithm reaches generalization error ε after asking for just O(d log 1 ) ε labels. This exponential improvement over the usual sample complexity of supervised learning had previously been demonstrated only for the computationally more complex query-by-committee algorithm.

<p>Author: Wenxin Jiang</p><p>Abstract: The statistical learning theory of risk minimization depends heavily on probability bounds for uniform deviations of the empirical risks. Classical probability bounds using Hoeffding’s inequality cannot accommodate more general situations with unbounded loss and dependent data. The current paper introduces an inequality that extends Hoeffding’s inequality to handle these more general situations. We will apply this inequality to provide probability bounds for uniform deviations in a very general framework, which can involve discrete decision rules, unbounded loss, and a dependence structure that can be more general than either martingale or strong mixing. We will consider two examples with high dimensional predictors: autoregression (AR) with ℓ1 -loss, and ARX model with variable selection for sign classiﬁcation, which uses both lagged responses and exogenous predictors.

<p>Author: Brian Kulis, Mátyás A. Sustik, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study low-rank matrix nearness problems, with a focus on learning low-rank positive semideﬁnite (kernel) matrices for machine learning applications. We propose efﬁcient algorithms that scale linearly in the number of data points and quadratically in the rank of the input matrix. Existing algorithms for learning kernel matrices often scale poorly, with running times that are cubic in the number of data points. We employ Bregman matrix divergences as the measures of nearness—these divergences are natural for learning low-rank kernels since they preserve rank as well as positive semideﬁniteness. Special cases of our framework yield faster algorithms for various existing learning problems, and experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms can effectively learn both low-rank and full-rank kernel matrices.

<p>Author: Francesco Orabona, Joseph Keshet, Barbara Caputo</p><p>Abstract: A common problem of kernel-based online algorithms, such as the kernel-based Perceptron algorithm, is the amount of memory required to store the online hypothesis, which may increase without bound as the algorithm progresses. Furthermore, the computational load of such algorithms grows linearly with the amount of memory used to store the hypothesis. To attack these problems, most previous work has focused on discarding some of the instances, in order to keep the memory bounded. In this paper we present a new algorithm, in which the instances are not discarded, but are instead projected onto the space spanned by the previous online hypothesis. We call this algorithm Projectron. While the memory size of the Projectron solution cannot be predicted before training, we prove that its solution is guaranteed to be bounded. We derive a relative mistake bound for the proposed algorithm, and deduce from it a slightly different algorithm which outperforms the Perceptron. We call this second algorithm Projectron++. We show that this algorithm can be extended to handle the multiclass and the structured output settings, resulting, as far as we know, in the ﬁrst online bounded algorithm that can learn complex classiﬁcation tasks. The method of bounding the hypothesis representation can be applied to any conservative online algorithm and to other online algorithms, as it is demonstrated for ALMA2 . Experimental results on various data sets show the empirical advantage of our technique compared to various bounded online algorithms, both in terms of memory and accuracy.

<p>Author: Jan Ramon, Siegfried Nijssen</p><p>Abstract: Algorithms that list graphs such that no two listed graphs are isomorphic, are important building blocks of systems for mining and learning in graphs. Algorithms are already known that solve this problem efﬁciently for many classes of graphs of restricted topology, such as trees. In this article we introduce the concept of a dense augmentation schema, and introduce an algorithm that can be used to enumerate any class of graphs with polynomial delay, as long as the class of graphs can be described using a monotonic predicate operating on a dense augmentation schema. In practice this means that this is the ﬁrst enumeration algorithm that can be applied theoretically efﬁciently in any frequent subgraph mining algorithm, and that this algorithm generalizes to situations beyond the standard frequent subgraph mining setting.

<p>Author: Eugene Tuv, Alexander Borisov, George Runger, Kari Torkkola</p><p>Abstract: Predictive models beneﬁt from a compact, non-redundant subset of features that improves interpretability and generalization. Modern data sets are wide, dirty, mixed with both numerical and categorical predictors, and may contain interactive effects that require complex models. This is a challenge for ﬁlters, wrappers, and embedded feature selection methods. We describe details of an algorithm using tree-based ensembles to generate a compact subset of non-redundant features. Parallel and serial ensembles of trees are combined into a mixed method that can uncover masking and detect features of secondary effect. Simulated and actual examples illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

<p>Author: Marc Boullé</p><p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of computer storage capacities, available data and demand for scoring models both follow an increasing trend, sharper than that of the processing power. However, the main limitation to a wide spread of data mining solutions is the non-increasing availability of skilled data analysts, which play a key role in data preparation and model selection. In this paper, we present a parameter-free scalable classiﬁcation method, which is a step towards fully automatic data mining. The method is based on Bayes optimal univariate conditional density estimators, naive Bayes classiﬁcation enhanced with a Bayesian variable selection scheme, and averaging of models using a logarithmic smoothing of the posterior distribution. We focus on the complexity of the algorithms and show how they can cope with data sets that are far larger than the available central memory. We ﬁnally report results on the Large Scale Learning challenge, where our method obtains state of the art performance within practicable computation time.

<p>Author: Raanan Yehezkel, Boaz Lerner</p><p>Abstract: We propose the recursive autonomy identiﬁcation (RAI) algorithm for constraint-based (CB) Bayesian network structure learning. The RAI algorithm learns the structure by sequential application of conditional independence (CI) tests, edge direction and structure decomposition into autonomous sub-structures. The sequence of operations is performed recursively for each autonomous substructure while simultaneously increasing the order of the CI test. While other CB algorithms d-separate structures and then direct the resulted undirected graph, the RAI algorithm combines the two processes from the outset and along the procedure. By this means and due to structure decomposition, learning a structure using RAI requires a smaller number of CI tests of high orders. This reduces the complexity and run-time of the algorithm and increases the accuracy by diminishing the curse-of-dimensionality. When the RAI algorithm learned structures from databases representing synthetic problems, known networks and natural problems, it demonstrated superiority with respect to computational complexity, run-time, structural correctness and classiﬁcation accuracy over the PC, Three Phase Dependency Analysis, Optimal Reinsertion, greedy search, Greedy Equivalence Search, Sparse Candidate, and Max-Min Hill-Climbing algorithms.

<p>Author: Yihua Chen, Eric K. Garcia, Maya R. Gupta, Ali Rahimi, Luca Cazzanti</p><p>Abstract: This paper reviews and extends the ﬁeld of similarity-based classiﬁcation, presenting new analyses, algorithms, data sets, and a comprehensive set of experimental results for a rich collection of classiﬁcation problems. Speciﬁcally, the generalizability of using similarities as features is analyzed, design goals and methods for weighting nearest-neighbors for similarity-based learning are proposed, and different methods for consistently converting similarities into kernels are compared. Experiments on eight real data sets compare eight approaches and their variants to similarity-based learning.

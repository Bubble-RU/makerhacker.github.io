<p>Author: Sébastien Bubeck, Ulrike von Luxburg</p><p>Abstract: Clustering is often formulated as a discrete optimization problem. The objective is to ﬁnd, among all partitions of the data set, the best one according to some quality measure. However, in the statistical setting where we assume that the ﬁnite data set has been sampled from some underlying space, the goal is not to ﬁnd the best partition of the given sample, but to approximate the true partition of the underlying space. We argue that the discrete optimization approach usually does not achieve this goal, and instead can lead to inconsistency. We construct examples which provably have this behavior. As in the case of supervised learning, the cure is to restrict the size of the function classes under consideration. For appropriate “small” function classes we can prove very general consistency theorems for clustering optimization schemes. As one particular algorithm for clustering with a restricted function space we introduce “nearest neighbor clustering”. Similar to the k-nearest neighbor classiﬁer in supervised learning, this algorithm can be seen as a general baseline algorithm to minimize arbitrary clustering objective functions. We prove that it is statistically consistent for all commonly used clustering objective functions.

<p>Author: Jie Chen, Haw-ren Fang, Yousef Saad</p><p>Abstract: Nearest neighbor graphs are widely used in data mining and machine learning. A brute-force method to compute the exact kNN graph takes Θ(dn2 ) time for n data points in the d dimensional Euclidean space. We propose two divide and conquer methods for computing an approximate kNN graph in Θ(dnt ) time for high dimensional data (large d). The exponent t ∈ (1, 2) is an increasing function of an internal parameter α which governs the size of the common region in the divide step. Experiments show that a high quality graph can usually be obtained with small overlaps, that is, for small values of t. A few of the practical details of the algorithms are as follows. First, the divide step uses an inexpensive Lanczos procedure to perform recursive spectral bisection. After each conquer step, an additional reﬁnement step is performed to improve the accuracy of the graph. Finally, a hash table is used to avoid repeating distance calculations during the divide and conquer process. The combination of these techniques is shown to yield quite effective algorithms for building kNN graphs.

<p>Author: Brian Tanner, Adam White</p><p>Abstract: RL-Glue is a standard, language-independent software package for reinforcement-learning experiments. The standardization provided by RL-Glue facilitates code sharing and collaboration. Code sharing reduces the need to re-engineer tasks and experimental apparatus, both common barriers to comparatively evaluating new ideas in the context of the literature. Our software features a minimalist interface and works with several languages and computing platforms. RL-Glue compatibility can be extended to any programming language that supports network socket communication. RL-Glue has been used to teach classes, to run international competitions, and is currently used by several other open-source software and hardware projects. Keywords: reinforcement learning, empirical evaluation, standardization, open source 1. Introduction and Motivation Reinforcement learning is an embodied, trial-and-error problem formulation for artiﬁcial intelligence (Sutton and Barto, 1998; Kaelbling et al., 1996; Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996). At a series of time steps, the agent emits actions in response to observations and rewards generated by the environment. The agent’s objective is to select actions that maximize the future rewards. Reinforcementlearning methods have been successfully applied to many problems including backgammon (Tesauro, 1994), elevator control (Crites and Barto, 1998), and helicopter control (Ng et al., 2004). Reinforcementlearning models and formalisms have inﬂuenced a number of ﬁelds, including operations research, cognitive science, optimal control, psychology, neuroscience, and others. Reinforcement-learning practitioners create their agents and environments using various incompatible software frameworks, making collaboration inconvenient and thus slowing progress in our community. It can be time consuming, difﬁcult, and sometimes even impossible to exactly reproduce the work of others. A conference or journal article is not the appropriate medium to share a sufﬁciently detailed speciﬁcation of the environment, agent and overall experimental apparatus. We need a convenient way to share source code. We believe that a standard programming interface for reinforcement-learning experiments will remove some barriers to collaboration and accelerate the pace of research in our ﬁeld. To encourage widespread adoption, this interface should be easy to adhere to, and it should not force users to abandon their favorite tools or languages. With these goals in mind, we have developed RL-Glue: language independent software for reinforcement-learning experiments. c 2009 Brian Tanner and Adam White. TANNER AND W HITE 2. RL-Glue Reinforcement-learning environments cannot be stored as ﬁxed data-sets, as is common in conventional supervised machine learning. The environment generates observations and rewards in response to actions selected by the agent, making it more natural to think of the environment and agent as interactive programs. Sutton and Barto describe one prevalent view of agent-environment interactions in their introductory text (1998). Their view, shown in Figure 1, clearly separates the agent and environment into different components which interact in a particular way, following a particular sequence. observation ot reward rt Agent action at rt+1 Environment ot+1 Figure 1: Sutton and Barto’s agent-environment interface, with states generalized to observations. White’s RL-Glue Protocol (2006) formalizes Sutton and Barto’s interface for online, singleagent reinforcement learning. The RL-Glue Protocol describes how the different aspects of a reinforcement-learning experiment should be arranged into programs, and the etiquette they should follow when communicating with each other. These programs (Figure 2) are the agent, the environment, the experiment, and RL-Glue. The agent program implements the learning algorithm and action-selection mechanism. The environment program implements the dynamics of the task and generates the observations and rewards. The experiment program directs the experiment’s execution, including the sequence of agent-environment interactions and agent performance evaluation. The RL-Glue program mediates the communication between the agent and environment programs in response to commands from the experiment program. Our RL-Glue software (RL-Glue) implements White’s protocol.1 Experiment Program Agent Program RL-Glue Program Environment Program Figure 2: The four programs speciﬁed by the RL-Glue Protocol. Arrows indicate the direction of the ﬂow of control. RL-Glue can be used either in internal or external mode. In internal mode, the agent, environment and experiment are linked into a single program, and their communication is through function calls. Internal mode is currently an option if the agent, environment, and experiment are written exclusively in Java or C/C++. In external mode, the agent, environment and experiment are linked 1. This can be found at http://glue.rl-community.org/protocol. 2134 RL-G LUE into separate programs. Each program connects to the RL-Glue server program, and all communication is over TCP/IP socket connections. External mode allows these programs to be written in any programming language that supports socket communication. External mode is currently supported for C/C++, Java, Python, Lisp, and Matlab. Each mode has its strengths and weaknesses. Internal mode has less overhead, so it can execute more steps per second. External mode is more ﬂexible and portable. The performance difference between the two modes vanishes as the agent or environment becomes complex enough that computation dominates the socket overhead in terms of time per step. The agent and environment are indifferent and unaware of their execution mode; the difference in modes lies only in how the agent and environment are linked or loaded. 3. RL-Glue in Practice RL-Glue’s provides a common interface for a number of software and hardware projects in the reinforcement-learning community. For example, there is the annual RL-Competition, where teams from around the world compare their agents on a variety of challenging environments. The competition software uses the API, called RL-Viz, that is layered on top of RL-Glue to dynamically load agent and environment programs, modify parameters at runtime and visualize interaction and performance. All of the environments and sample agents created by the competition organizers are added to the RL-Library, a public, community-supported repository of RL-Glue compatible code. The RL-Library is also available as an archive of top competition agents, challenge problems, project code from academic publications, or any other RL-Glue compatible software that members of our community would like to share. The socket architecture of RL-Glue allows diverse software and hardware platforms to be connected as RL-Glue environment programs. There are ongoing projects that connect a mobile robot platform, a keepaway soccer server, a real-time strategy game, and an Atari emulator to RL-Glue. Our socket architecture helps lower the barriers for researchers wishing to work on larger scale environments by providing a simple and familiar interface. RL-Glue has been used for teaching reinforcement learning in several university courses and to create experiments for scientiﬁc articles published in leading conferences. See our RL-Glue in practice web page for an updated list of projects and papers that have used RL-Glue.2 4. Other Reinforcement-Learning Software Projects RL-Glue is not the ﬁrst software project that aims to standardize empirical reinforcement learning or to make agent and environment programs more accessible within our community. However, RLGlue is the only project that offers a standardized language-independent interface, rich actions and observations, and ﬁne-grained control of the experiment. Other projects, most notably: CLSquare,3 PIQLE,4 RL Toolbox,5 JRLF,6 and LibPG,7 offer signiﬁcant value to the reinforcement-learning community by offering agents and environments, 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.

Our design makes it relatively easy to interface existing frameworks with RL-Glue. We are currently offering our assistance in bridging other frameworks to RL-Glue, with the hope of improving access to all of these tools for all members of our community. 5.

<p>Author: Thomas Abeel, Yves Van de Peer, Yvan Saeys</p><p>Abstract: Java-ML is a collection of machine learning and data mining algorithms, which aims to be a readily usable and easily extensible API for both software developers and research scientists. The interfaces for each type of algorithm are kept simple and algorithms strictly follow their respective interface. Comparing different classiﬁers or clustering algorithms is therefore straightforward, and implementing new algorithms is also easy. The implementations of the algorithms are clearly written, properly documented and can thus be used as a reference. The library is written in Java and is available from http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/ under the GNU GPL license.

<p>Author: Tyler J. VanderWeele, James M. Robins</p><p>Abstract: Various relationships are shown hold between monotonic effects and weak monotonic effects and the monotonicity of certain conditional expectations. Counterexamples are provided to show that the results do not hold under less restrictive conditions. Monotonic effects are furthermore used to relate signed edges on a causal directed acyclic graph to qualitative effect modiﬁcation. The theory is applied to an example concerning the direct effect of smoking on cardiovascular disease controlling for hypercholesterolemia. Monotonicity assumptions are used to construct a test for whether there is a variable that confounds the relationship between the mediator, hypercholesterolemia, and the outcome, cardiovascular disease.

<p>Author: Hui Li, Xuejun Liao, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) in multiple partially observable stochastic environments. We introduce the regionalized policy representation (RPR) to characterize the agent’s behavior in each environment. The RPR is a parametric model of the conditional distribution over current actions given the history of past actions and observations; the agent’s choice of actions is directly based on this conditional distribution, without an intervening model to characterize the environment itself. We propose off-policy batch algorithms to learn the parameters of the RPRs, using episodic data collected when following a behavior policy, and show their linkage to policy iteration. We employ the Dirichlet process as a nonparametric prior over the RPRs across multiple environments. The intrinsic clustering property of the Dirichlet process imposes sharing of episodes among similar environments, which effectively reduces the number of episodes required for learning a good policy in each environment, when data sharing is appropriate. The number of distinct RPRs and the associated clusters (the sharing patterns) are automatically discovered by exploiting the episodic data as well as the nonparametric nature of the Dirichlet process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RPR as well as the RPR-based MTRL framework on various problems, including grid-world navigation and multi-aspect target classiﬁcation. The experimental results show that the RPR is a competitive reinforcement learning algorithm in partially observable domains, and the MTRL consistently achieves better performance than single task reinforcement learning.

Properties of an RKBS and its reproducing kernel are investigated. As applications, we develop in the framework of RKBS standard learning schemes including minimal norm interpolation, regularization network, support vector machines, and kernel principal component analysis. In particular, existence, uniqueness and representer theorems are established.

<p>Author: Jan Ramon, Siegfried Nijssen</p><p>Abstract: Algorithms that list graphs such that no two listed graphs are isomorphic, are important building blocks of systems for mining and learning in graphs. Algorithms are already known that solve this problem efﬁciently for many classes of graphs of restricted topology, such as trees. In this article we introduce the concept of a dense augmentation schema, and introduce an algorithm that can be used to enumerate any class of graphs with polynomial delay, as long as the class of graphs can be described using a monotonic predicate operating on a dense augmentation schema. In practice this means that this is the ﬁrst enumeration algorithm that can be applied theoretically efﬁciently in any frequent subgraph mining algorithm, and that this algorithm generalizes to situations beyond the standard frequent subgraph mining setting.

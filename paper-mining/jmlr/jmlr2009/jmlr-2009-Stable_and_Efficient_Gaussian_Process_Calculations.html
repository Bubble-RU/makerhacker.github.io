<p>Author: Kristian Woodsend, Jacek Gondzio</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines are a powerful machine learning technology, but the training process involves a dense quadratic optimization problem and is computationally challenging. A parallel implementation of linear Support Vector Machine training has been developed, using a combination of MPI and OpenMP. Using an interior point method for the optimization and a reformulation that avoids the dense Hessian matrix, the structure of the augmented system matrix is exploited to partition data and computations amongst parallel processors efﬁciently. The new implementation has been applied to solve problems from the PASCAL Challenge on Large-scale Learning. We show that our approach is competitive, and is able to solve problems in the Challenge many times faster than other parallel approaches. We also demonstrate that the hybrid version performs more efﬁciently than the version using pure MPI.

<p>Author: Shivani Agarwal, Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: The problem of ranking, in which the goal is to learn a real-valued ranking function that induces a ranking or ordering over an instance space, has recently gained much attention in machine learning. We study generalization properties of ranking algorithms using the notion of algorithmic stability; in particular, we derive generalization bounds for ranking algorithms that have good stability properties. We show that kernel-based ranking algorithms that perform regularization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space have such stability properties, and therefore our bounds can be applied to these algorithms; this is in contrast with generalization bounds based on uniform convergence, which in many cases cannot be applied to these algorithms. Our results generalize earlier results that were derived in the special setting of bipartite ranking (Agarwal and Niyogi, 2005) to a more general setting of the ranking problem that arises frequently in applications.

<p>Author: Jacob Abernethy, Francis Bach, Theodoros Evgeniou, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We present a general approach for collaborative ﬁltering (CF) using spectral regularization to learn linear operators mapping a set of “users” to a set of possibly desired “objects”. In particular, several recent low-rank type matrix-completion methods for CF are shown to be special cases of our proposed framework. Unlike existing regularization-based CF, our approach can be used to incorporate additional information such as attributes of the users/objects—a feature currently lacking in existing regularization-based CF approaches—using popular and well-known kernel methods. We provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods. We then provide learning algorithms based on low-rank decompositions and test them on a standard CF data set. The experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization-based CF methods to incorporate related information about users and objects. Finally, we show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases of our proposed approach.

Vector Versus Matrix Regularizers</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Argyriou, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We consider a general class of regularization methods which learn a vector of parameters on the basis of linear measurements. It is well known that if the regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the L2 norm, then the learned vector is a linear combination of the input data. This result, known as the representer theorem, lies at the basis of kernel-based methods in machine learning. In this paper, we prove the necessity of the above condition, in the case of differentiable regularizers. We further extend our analysis to regularization methods which learn a matrix, a problem which is motivated by the application to multi-task learning. In this context, we study a more general representer theorem, which holds for a larger class of regularizers. We provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition characterizing this class of matrix regularizers and we highlight some concrete examples of practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles from matrix theory, especially the useful notion of matrix nondecreasing functions.

<p>Author: Brian Kulis, Mátyás A. Sustik, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study low-rank matrix nearness problems, with a focus on learning low-rank positive semideﬁnite (kernel) matrices for machine learning applications. We propose efﬁcient algorithms that scale linearly in the number of data points and quadratically in the rank of the input matrix. Existing algorithms for learning kernel matrices often scale poorly, with running times that are cubic in the number of data points. We employ Bregman matrix divergences as the measures of nearness—these divergences are natural for learning low-rank kernels since they preserve rank as well as positive semideﬁniteness. Special cases of our framework yield faster algorithms for various existing learning problems, and experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms can effectively learn both low-rank and full-rank kernel matrices.

<p>Author: Sanjoy Dasgupta, Adam Tauman Kalai, Claire Monteleoni</p><p>Abstract: We start by showing that in an active learning setting, the Perceptron algorithm needs Ω( ε12 ) labels to learn linear separators within generalization error ε. We then present a simple active learning algorithm for this problem, which combines a modiﬁcation of the Perceptron update with an adaptive ﬁltering rule for deciding which points to query. For data distributed uniformly over the unit ˜ sphere, we show that our algorithm reaches generalization error ε after asking for just O(d log 1 ) ε labels. This exponential improvement over the usual sample complexity of supervised learning had previously been demonstrated only for the computationally more complex query-by-committee algorithm.

<p>Author: Shaowei Lin, Bernd Sturmfels, Zhiqiang Xu</p><p>Abstract: Inference in Bayesian statistics involves the evaluation of marginal likelihood integrals. We present algebraic algorithms for computing such integrals exactly for discrete data of small sample size. Our methods apply to both uniform priors and Dirichlet priors. The underlying statistical models are mixtures of independent distributions, or, in geometric language, secant varieties of SegreVeronese varieties.

<p>Author: Luciana Ferrer, Kemal Sönmez, Elizabeth Shriberg</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for training support vector machine (SVM)-based classiﬁcation systems for combination with other classiﬁcation systems designed for the same task. Ideally, a new system should be designed such that, when combined with existing systems, the resulting performance is optimized. We present a simple model for this problem and use the understanding gained from this analysis to propose a method to achieve better combination performance when training SVM systems. We include a regularization term in the SVM objective function that aims to reduce the average class-conditional covariance between the resulting scores and the scores produced by the existing systems, introducing a trade-off between such covariance and the system’s individual performance. That is, the new system “takes one for the team”, falling somewhat short of its best possible performance in order to increase the diversity of the ensemble. We report results on the NIST 2005 and 2006 speaker recognition evaluations (SREs) for a variety of subsystems. We show a gain of 19% on the equal error rate (EER) of a combination of four systems when applying the proposed method with respect to the performance obtained when the four systems are trained independently of each other.

<p>Author: Steffen Bickel, Michael Brückner, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address classiﬁcation problems for which the training instances are governed by an input distribution that is allowed to differ arbitrarily from the test distribution—problems also referred to as classiﬁcation under covariate shift. We derive a solution that is purely discriminative: neither training nor test distribution are modeled explicitly. The problem of learning under covariate shift can be written as an integrated optimization problem. Instantiating the general optimization problem leads to a kernel logistic regression and an exponential model classiﬁer for covariate shift. The optimization problem is convex under certain conditions; our ﬁndings also clarify the relationship to the known kernel mean matching procedure. We report on experiments on problems of spam ﬁltering, text classiﬁcation, and landmine detection.

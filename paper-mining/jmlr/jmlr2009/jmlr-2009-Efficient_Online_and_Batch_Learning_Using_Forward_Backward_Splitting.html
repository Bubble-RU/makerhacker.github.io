<p>Author: John Langford, Lihong Li, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of onlinelearning algorithms with convex loss functions. This method has several essential properties: 1. The degree of sparsity is continuous—a parameter controls the rate of sparsiﬁcation from no sparsiﬁcation to total sparsiﬁcation. 2. The approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1 -regularization method in the batch setting. We prove that small rates of sparsiﬁcation result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. 3. The approach works well empirically.

<p>Author: Vojtěch Franc, Sören Sonnenburg</p><p>Abstract: We have developed an optimized cutting plane algorithm (OCA) for solving large-scale risk minimization problems. We prove that the number of iterations OCA requires to converge to a ε precise solution is approximately linear in the sample size. We also derive OCAS, an OCA-based linear binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) solver, and OCAM, a linear multi-class SVM solver. In an extensive empirical evaluation we show that OCAS outperforms current state-of-the-art SVM solvers like SVMlight , SVMperf and BMRM, achieving speedup factor more than 1,200 over SVMlight on some data sets and speedup factor of 29 over SVMperf , while obtaining the same precise support vector solution. OCAS, even in the early optimization steps, often shows faster convergence than the currently prevailing approximative methods in this domain, SGD and Pegasos. In addition, our proposed linear multi-class SVM solver, OCAM, achieves speedups of factor of up to 10 compared to SVMmulti−class . Finally, we use OCAS and OCAM in two real-world applications, the problem of human acceptor splice site detection and malware detection. Effectively parallelizing OCAS, we achieve state-of-the-art results on an acceptor splice site recognition problem only by being able to learn from all the available 50 million examples in a 12-million-dimensional feature space.

<p>Author: Steffen Bickel, Michael Brückner, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address classiﬁcation problems for which the training instances are governed by an input distribution that is allowed to differ arbitrarily from the test distribution—problems also referred to as classiﬁcation under covariate shift. We derive a solution that is purely discriminative: neither training nor test distribution are modeled explicitly. The problem of learning under covariate shift can be written as an integrated optimization problem. Instantiating the general optimization problem leads to a kernel logistic regression and an exponential model classiﬁer for covariate shift. The optimization problem is convex under certain conditions; our ﬁndings also clarify the relationship to the known kernel mean matching procedure. We report on experiments on problems of spam ﬁltering, text classiﬁcation, and landmine detection.

<p>Author: Jose M. Peña, Roland Nilsson, Johan Björkegren, Jesper Tegnér</p><p>Abstract: We present a sound and complete graphical criterion for reading dependencies from the minimal undirected independence map G of a graphoid M that satisﬁes weak transitivity. Here, complete means that it is able to read all the dependencies in M that can be derived by applying the graphoid properties and weak transitivity to the dependencies used in the construction of G and the independencies obtained from G by vertex separation. We argue that assuming weak transitivity is not too restrictive. As an intermediate step in the derivation of the graphical criterion, we prove that for any undirected graph G there exists a strictly positive discrete probability distribution with the prescribed sample spaces that is faithful to G. We also report an algorithm that implements the graphical criterion and whose running time is considered to be at most O(n2 (e + n)) for n nodes and e edges. Finally, we illustrate how the graphical criterion can be used within bioinformatics to identify biologically meaningful gene dependencies.

<p>Author: Omid Madani, Michael Connor, Wiley Greiner</p><p>Abstract: Many learning tasks, such as large-scale text categorization and word prediction, can beneﬁt from efﬁcient training and classiﬁcation when the number of classes, in addition to instances and features, is large, that is, in the thousands and beyond. We investigate the learning of sparse class indices to address this challenge. An index is a mapping from features to classes. We compare the index-learning methods against other techniques, including one-versus-rest and top-down classiﬁcation using perceptrons and support vector machines. We ﬁnd that index learning is highly advantageous for space and time efﬁciency, at both training and classiﬁcation times. Moreover, this approach yields similar and at times better accuracies. On problems with hundreds of thousands of instances and thousands of classes, the index is learned in minutes, while other methods can take hours or days. As we explain, the design of the learning update enables conveniently constraining each feature to connect to a small subset of the classes in the index. This constraint is crucial for scalability. Given an instance with l active (positive-valued) features, each feature on average connecting to d classes in the index (in the order of 10s in our experiments), update and classiﬁcation take O(dl log(dl)).

<p>Author: John Duchi, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe, analyze, and experiment with a framework for empirical loss minimization with regularization. Our algorithmic framework alternates between two phases. On each iteration we ﬁrst perform an unconstrained gradient descent step. We then cast and solve an instantaneous optimization problem that trades off minimization of a regularization term while keeping close proximity to the result of the ﬁrst phase. This view yields a simple yet effective algorithm that can be used for batch penalized risk minimization and online learning. Furthermore, the two phase approach enables sparse solutions when used in conjunction with regularization functions that promote sparsity, such as ℓ1 . We derive concrete and very simple algorithms for minimization of loss functions with ℓ1 , ℓ2 , ℓ2 , and ℓ∞ regularization. We also show how to construct ef2 ﬁcient algorithms for mixed-norm ℓ1 /ℓq regularization. We further extend the algorithms and give efﬁcient implementations for very high-dimensional data with sparsity. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework in a series of experiments with synthetic and natural data sets.

<p>Author: John Langford, Lihong Li, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of onlinelearning algorithms with convex loss functions. This method has several essential properties: 1. The degree of sparsity is continuous—a parameter controls the rate of sparsiﬁcation from no sparsiﬁcation to total sparsiﬁcation. 2. The approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1 -regularization method in the batch setting. We prove that small rates of sparsiﬁcation result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. 3. The approach works well empirically. We apply the approach to several data sets and ﬁnd for data sets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable.

<p>Author: Jose M. Peña, Roland Nilsson, Johan Björkegren, Jesper Tegnér</p><p>Abstract: We present a sound and complete graphical criterion for reading dependencies from the minimal undirected independence map G of a graphoid M that satisﬁes weak transitivity. Here, complete means that it is able to read all the dependencies in M that can be derived by applying the graphoid properties and weak transitivity to the dependencies used in the construction of G and the independencies obtained from G by vertex separation. We argue that assuming weak transitivity is not too restrictive. As an intermediate step in the derivation of the graphical criterion, we prove that for any undirected graph G there exists a strictly positive discrete probability distribution with the prescribed sample spaces that is faithful to G. We also report an algorithm that implements the graphical criterion and whose running time is considered to be at most O(n2 (e + n)) for n nodes and e edges. Finally, we illustrate how the graphical criterion can be used within bioinformatics to identify biologically meaningful gene dependencies.

<p>Author: Antoine Bordes, Léon Bottou, Patrick Gallinari</p><p>Abstract: The SGD-QN algorithm is a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that makes careful use of secondorder information and splits the parameter update into independently scheduled components. Thanks to this design, SGD-QN iterates nearly as fast as a ﬁrst-order stochastic gradient descent but requires less iterations to achieve the same accuracy. This algorithm won the “Wild Track” of the ﬁrst PASCAL Large Scale Learning Challenge (Sonnenburg et al., 2008).

<p>Author: Kristian Woodsend, Jacek Gondzio</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines are a powerful machine learning technology, but the training process involves a dense quadratic optimization problem and is computationally challenging. A parallel implementation of linear Support Vector Machine training has been developed, using a combination of MPI and OpenMP. Using an interior point method for the optimization and a reformulation that avoids the dense Hessian matrix, the structure of the augmented system matrix is exploited to partition data and computations amongst parallel processors efﬁciently. The new implementation has been applied to solve problems from the PASCAL Challenge on Large-scale Learning. We show that our approach is competitive, and is able to solve problems in the Challenge many times faster than other parallel approaches. We also demonstrate that the hybrid version performs more efﬁciently than the version using pure MPI.

<p>Author: John Langford, Lihong Li, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of onlinelearning algorithms with convex loss functions. This method has several essential properties: 1. The degree of sparsity is continuous—a parameter controls the rate of sparsiﬁcation from no sparsiﬁcation to total sparsiﬁcation. 2. The approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1 -regularization method in the batch setting. We prove that small rates of sparsiﬁcation result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. 3. The approach works well empirically. We apply the approach to several data sets and ﬁnd for data sets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable.

<p>Author: Steffen Bickel, Michael Brückner, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address classiﬁcation problems for which the training instances are governed by an input distribution that is allowed to differ arbitrarily from the test distribution—problems also referred to as classiﬁcation under covariate shift. We derive a solution that is purely discriminative: neither training nor test distribution are modeled explicitly. The problem of learning under covariate shift can be written as an integrated optimization problem. Instantiating the general optimization problem leads to a kernel logistic regression and an exponential model classiﬁer for covariate shift. The optimization problem is convex under certain conditions; our ﬁndings also clarify the relationship to the known kernel mean matching procedure. We report on experiments on problems of spam ﬁltering, text classiﬁcation, and landmine detection.

<p>Author: Omid Madani, Michael Connor, Wiley Greiner</p><p>Abstract: Many learning tasks, such as large-scale text categorization and word prediction, can beneﬁt from efﬁcient training and classiﬁcation when the number of classes, in addition to instances and features, is large, that is, in the thousands and beyond. We investigate the learning of sparse class indices to address this challenge. An index is a mapping from features to classes. We compare the index-learning methods against other techniques, including one-versus-rest and top-down classiﬁcation using perceptrons and support vector machines. We ﬁnd that index learning is highly advantageous for space and time efﬁciency, at both training and classiﬁcation times. Moreover, this approach yields similar and at times better accuracies. On problems with hundreds of thousands of instances and thousands of classes, the index is learned in minutes, while other methods can take hours or days. As we explain, the design of the learning update enables conveniently constraining each feature to connect to a small subset of the classes in the index. This constraint is crucial for scalability. Given an instance with l active (positive-valued) features, each feature on average connecting to d classes in the index (in the order of 10s in our experiments), update and classiﬁcation take O(dl log(dl)).

<p>Author: Hugo Jair Escalante, Manuel Montes, Luis Enrique Sucar</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes the application of particle swarm optimization (PSO) to the problem of full model selection, FMS, for classiﬁcation tasks. FMS is deﬁned as follows: given a pool of preprocessing methods, feature selection and learning algorithms, to select the combination of these that obtains the lowest classiﬁcation error for a given data set; the task also includes the selection of hyperparameters for the considered methods. This problem generates a vast search space to be explored, well suited for stochastic optimization techniques. FMS can be applied to any classiﬁcation domain as it does not require domain knowledge. Different model types and a variety of algorithms can be considered under this formulation. Furthermore, competitive yet simple models can be obtained with FMS. We adopt PSO for the search because of its proven performance in different problems and because of its simplicity, since neither expensive computations nor complicated operations are needed. Interestingly, the way the search is guided allows PSO to avoid overﬁtting to some extend. Experimental results on benchmark data sets give evidence that the proposed approach is very effective, despite its simplicity. Furthermore, results obtained in the framework of a model selection challenge show the competitiveness of the models selected with PSO, compared to models selected with other techniques that focus on a single algorithm and that use domain knowledge.

<p>Author: Leonid (Aryeh) Kontorovich, Boaz Nadler</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for supervised learning of discrete concepts. Since the 1970’s, the standard computational primitive has been to ﬁnd the most consistent hypothesis in a given complexity class. In contrast, in this paper we propose a new basic operation: for each pair of input instances, count how many concepts of bounded complexity contain both of them. Our approach maps instances to a Hilbert space, whose metric is induced by a universal kernel coinciding with our computational primitive, and identiﬁes concepts with half-spaces. We prove that all concepts are linearly separable under this mapping. Hence, given a labeled sample and an oracle for evaluating the universal kernel, we can efﬁciently compute a linear classiﬁer (via SVM, for example) and use margin bounds to control its generalization error. Even though exact evaluation of the universal kernel may be infeasible, in various natural situations it is efﬁciently approximable. Though our approach is general, our main application is to regular languages. Our approach presents a substantial departure from current learning paradigms and in particular yields a novel method for learning this fundamental concept class. Unlike existing techniques, we make no structural assumptions on the corresponding unknown automata, the string distribution or the completeness of the training set. Instead, given a labeled sample our algorithm outputs a classiﬁer with guaranteed distribution-free generalization bounds; to our knowledge, the proposed framework is the only one capable of achieving the latter. Along the way, we touch upon several fundamental questions in complexity, automata, and machine learning.

<p>Author: Marc Boullé</p><p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of computer storage capacities, available data and demand for scoring models both follow an increasing trend, sharper than that of the processing power. However, the main limitation to a wide spread of data mining solutions is the non-increasing availability of skilled data analysts, which play a key role in data preparation and model selection. In this paper, we present a parameter-free scalable classiﬁcation method, which is a step towards fully automatic data mining. The method is based on Bayes optimal univariate conditional density estimators, naive Bayes classiﬁcation enhanced with a Bayesian variable selection scheme, and averaging of models using a logarithmic smoothing of the posterior distribution. We focus on the complexity of the algorithms and show how they can cope with data sets that are far larger than the available central memory. We ﬁnally report results on the Large Scale Learning challenge, where our method obtains state of the art performance within practicable computation time.

<p>Author: Kristian Woodsend, Jacek Gondzio</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines are a powerful machine learning technology, but the training process involves a dense quadratic optimization problem and is computationally challenging. A parallel implementation of linear Support Vector Machine training has been developed, using a combination of MPI and OpenMP. Using an interior point method for the optimization and a reformulation that avoids the dense Hessian matrix, the structure of the augmented system matrix is exploited to partition data and computations amongst parallel processors efﬁciently. The new implementation has been applied to solve problems from the PASCAL Challenge on Large-scale Learning. We show that our approach is competitive, and is able to solve problems in the Challenge many times faster than other parallel approaches. We also demonstrate that the hybrid version performs more efﬁciently than the version using pure MPI.

<p>Author: Adam R. Klivans, Philip M. Long, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: We give new algorithms for learning halfspaces in the challenging malicious noise model, where an adversary may corrupt both the labels and the underlying distribution of examples. Our algorithms can tolerate malicious noise rates exponentially larger than previous work in terms of the dependence on the dimension n, and succeed for the fairly broad class of all isotropic log-concave distributions. We give poly(n, 1/ε)-time algorithms for solving the following problems to accuracy ε: • Learning origin-centered halfspaces in Rn with respect to the uniform distribution on the unit ball with malicious noise rate η = Ω(ε2 / log(n/ε)). (The best previous result was Ω(ε/(n log(n/ε))1/4 ).) • Learning origin-centered halfspaces with respect to any isotropic logconcave distribution on Rn with malicious noise rate η = Ω(ε3 / log2 (n/ε)). This is the ﬁrst efﬁcient algorithm for learning under isotropic log-concave distributions in the presence of malicious noise. We also give a poly(n, 1/ε)-time algorithm for learning origin-centered halfspaces under any isotropic log-concave distribution on Rn in the presence of adversarial label noise at rate η = Ω(ε3 / log(1/ε)). In the adversarial label noise setting (or agnostic model), labels can be noisy, but not example points themselves. Previous results could handle η = Ω(ε) but had running time exponential in an unspeciﬁed function of 1/ε. Our analysis crucially exploits both concentration and anti-concentration properties of isotropic log-concave distributions. Our algorithms combine an iterative outlier removal procedure using Principal Component Analysis together with “smooth” boosting.

<p>Author: Antoine Bordes, Léon Bottou, Patrick Gallinari</p><p>Abstract: The SGD-QN algorithm is a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that makes careful use of secondorder information and splits the parameter update into independently scheduled components. Thanks to this design, SGD-QN iterates nearly as fast as a ﬁrst-order stochastic gradient descent but requires less iterations to achieve the same accuracy. This algorithm won the “Wild Track” of the ﬁrst PASCAL Large Scale Learning Challenge (Sonnenburg et al., 2008).

<p>Author: Eugene Tuv, Alexander Borisov, George Runger, Kari Torkkola</p><p>Abstract: Predictive models beneﬁt from a compact, non-redundant subset of features that improves interpretability and generalization. Modern data sets are wide, dirty, mixed with both numerical and categorical predictors, and may contain interactive effects that require complex models. This is a challenge for ﬁlters, wrappers, and embedded feature selection methods. We describe details of an algorithm using tree-based ensembles to generate a compact subset of non-redundant features. Parallel and serial ensembles of trees are combined into a mixed method that can uncover masking and detect features of secondary effect. Simulated and actual examples illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

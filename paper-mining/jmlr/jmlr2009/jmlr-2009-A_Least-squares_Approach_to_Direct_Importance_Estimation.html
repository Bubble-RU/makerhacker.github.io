<p>Author: Steffen Bickel, Michael Brückner, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address classiﬁcation problems for which the training instances are governed by an input distribution that is allowed to differ arbitrarily from the test distribution—problems also referred to as classiﬁcation under covariate shift. We derive a solution that is purely discriminative: neither training nor test distribution are modeled explicitly. The problem of learning under covariate shift can be written as an integrated optimization problem. Instantiating the general optimization problem leads to a kernel logistic regression and an exponential model classiﬁer for covariate shift. The optimization problem is convex under certain conditions; our ﬁndings also clarify the relationship to the known kernel mean matching procedure.

M 2 provides a simple and intuitive framework in which users can evaluate classiﬁers under hypothesized shifts in distribution and therefore determine the best model (or models) for their data under a number of potential scenarios. Additionally, M 2 is fully integrated with the WEKA machine learning environment, so that a variety of commodity classiﬁers can be used if desired.

This problem occurs in areas like e-commerce, politics, spam ﬁltering and improper content detection. We present consistent estimators which can reconstruct the correct labels with high probability in a uniform convergence sense. Experiments show that our method works well in practice.

Vector Versus Matrix Regularizers</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Argyriou, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We consider a general class of regularization methods which learn a vector of parameters on the basis of linear measurements. It is well known that if the regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the L2 norm, then the learned vector is a linear combination of the input data. This result, known as the representer theorem, lies at the basis of kernel-based methods in machine learning. In this paper, we prove the necessity of the above condition, in the case of differentiable regularizers. We further extend our analysis to regularization methods which learn a matrix, a problem which is motivated by the application to multi-task learning. In this context, we study a more general representer theorem, which holds for a larger class of regularizers. We provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition characterizing this class of matrix regularizers and we highlight some concrete examples of practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles from matrix theory, especially the useful notion of matrix nondecreasing functions.

<p>Author: Han Liu, John Lafferty, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: Recent methods for estimating sparse undirected graphs for real-valued data in high dimensional problems rely heavily on the assumption of normality. We show how to use a semiparametric Gaussian copula—or “nonparanormal”—for high dimensional inference. Just as additive models extend linear models by replacing linear functions with a set of one-dimensional smooth functions, the nonparanormal extends the normal by transforming the variables by smooth functions. We derive a method for estimating the nonparanormal, study the method’s theoretical properties, and show that it works well in many examples.

<p>Author: Mathias Drton, Michael Eichler, Thomas S. Richardson</p><p>Abstract: In recursive linear models, the multivariate normal joint distribution of all variables exhibits a dependence structure induced by a recursive (or acyclic) system of linear structural equations. These linear models have a long tradition and appear in seemingly unrelated regressions, structural equation modelling, and approaches to causal inference. They are also related to Gaussian graphical models via a classical representation known as a path diagram. Despite the models’ long history, a number of problems remain open. In this paper, we address the problem of computing maximum likelihood estimates in the subclass of ‘bow-free’ recursive linear models. The term ‘bow-free’ refers to the condition that the errors for variables i and j be uncorrelated if variable i occurs in the structural equation for variable j. We introduce a new algorithm, termed Residual Iterative Conditional Fitting (RICF), that can be implemented using only least squares computations. In contrast to existing algorithms, RICF has clear convergence properties and yields exact maximum likelihood estimates after the ﬁrst iteration whenever the MLE is available in closed form.

<p>Author: Alexander L. Strehl, Lihong Li, Michael L. Littman</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning near-optimal behavior in ﬁnite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a polynomial number of samples. These “PAC-MDP” algorithms include the wellknown E3 and R-MAX algorithms as well as the more recent Delayed Q-learning algorithm. We summarize the current state-of-the-art by presenting bounds for the problem in a uniﬁed theoretical framework. A more reﬁned analysis for upper and lower bounds is presented to yield insight into the differences between the model-free Delayed Q-learning and the model-based R-MAX. Keywords: reinforcement learning, Markov decision processes, PAC-MDP, exploration, sample complexity</p><p>4 0.1919402 <a title="1-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2009-Marginal_Likelihood_Integrals_for_Mixtures_of_Independence_Models.html">53 jmlr-2009-Marginal Likelihood Integrals for Mixtures of Independence Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Shaowei Lin, Bernd Sturmfels, Zhiqiang Xu</p><p>Abstract: Inference in Bayesian statistics involves the evaluation of marginal likelihood integrals. We present algebraic algorithms for computing such integrals exactly for discrete data of small sample size. Our methods apply to both uniform priors and Dirichlet priors. The underlying statistical models are mixtures of independent distributions, or, in geometric language, secant varieties of SegreVeronese varieties.

<p>Author: Jonathan Huang, Carlos Guestrin, Leonidas Guibas</p><p>Abstract: Permutations are ubiquitous in many real-world problems, such as voting, ranking, and data association. Representing uncertainty over permutations is challenging, since there are n! possibilities, and typical compact and factorized probability distribution representations, such as graphical models, cannot capture the mutual exclusivity constraints associated with permutations. In this paper, we use the “low-frequency” terms of a Fourier decomposition to represent distributions over permutations compactly. We present Kronecker conditioning, a novel approach for maintaining and updating these distributions directly in the Fourier domain, allowing for polynomial time bandlimited approximations. Low order Fourier-based approximations, however, may lead to functions that do not correspond to valid distributions. To address this problem, we present a quadratic program deﬁned directly in the Fourier domain for projecting the approximation onto a relaxation of the polytope of legal marginal distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real camera-based multi-person tracking scenario.

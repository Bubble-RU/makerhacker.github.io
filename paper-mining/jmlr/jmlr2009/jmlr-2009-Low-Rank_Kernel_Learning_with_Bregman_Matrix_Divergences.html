<p>Author: Barnabás Póczos, András Lőrincz</p><p>Abstract: We introduce novel online Bayesian methods for the identiﬁcation of a family of noisy recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We present Bayesian active learning techniques for stimulus selection given past experiences. In particular, we consider the unknown parameters as stochastic variables and use A-optimality and D-optimality principles to choose optimal stimuli. We derive myopic cost functions in order to maximize the information gain concerning network parameters at each time step. We also derive the A-optimal and D-optimal estimations of the additive noise that perturbs the dynamical system of the RNN. Here we investigate myopic as well as non-myopic estimations, and study the problem of simultaneous estimation of both the system parameters and the noise. Employing conjugate priors our derivations remain approximation-free and give rise to simple update rules for the online learning of the parameters. The efﬁciency of our method is demonstrated for a number of selected cases, including the task of controlled independent component analysis.

We develop the theory of structure spaces and derive geometrical and analytical concepts such as the angle between structures and the derivative of functions on structures. In particular, we show that the gradient of a differentiable structural function is a well-deﬁned structure pointing in the direction of steepest ascent. Exploiting the properties of structure spaces, it will turn out that a number of problems in structural pattern recognition such as central clustering or learning in structured output spaces can be formulated as optimization problems with cost functions that are locally Lipschitz. Hence, methods from nonsmooth analysis are applicable to optimize those cost functions.

<p>Author: Wenxin Jiang</p><p>Abstract: The statistical learning theory of risk minimization depends heavily on probability bounds for uniform deviations of the empirical risks. Classical probability bounds using Hoeffding’s inequality cannot accommodate more general situations with unbounded loss and dependent data. The current paper introduces an inequality that extends Hoeffding’s inequality to handle these more general situations. We will apply this inequality to provide probability bounds for uniform deviations in a very general framework, which can involve discrete decision rules, unbounded loss, and a dependence structure that can be more general than either martingale or strong mixing. We will consider two examples with high dimensional predictors: autoregression (AR) with ℓ1 -loss, and ARX model with variable selection for sign classiﬁcation, which uses both lagged responses and exogenous predictors.

<p>Author: André F. T. Martins, Noah A. Smith, Eric P. Xing, Pedro M. Q. Aguiar, Mário A. T. Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: Positive deﬁnite kernels on probability measures have been recently applied to classiﬁcation problems involving text, images, and other types of structured data. Some of these kernels are related to classic information theoretic quantities, such as (Shannon’s) mutual information and the JensenShannon (JS) divergence. Meanwhile, there have been recent advances in nonextensive generalizations of Shannon’s information theory. This paper bridges these two trends by introducing nonextensive information theoretic kernels on probability measures, based on new JS-type divergences. These new divergences result from extending the the two building blocks of the classical JS divergence: convexity and Shannon’s entropy. The notion of convexity is extended to the wider concept of q-convexity, for which we prove a Jensen q-inequality. Based on this inequality, we introduce Jensen-Tsallis (JT) q-differences, a nonextensive generalization of the JS divergence, and deﬁne a k-th order JT q-difference between stochastic processes. We then deﬁne a new family of nonextensive mutual information kernels, which allow weights to be assigned to their arguments, and which includes the Boolean, JS, and linear kernels as particular cases. Nonextensive string kernels are also deﬁned that generalize the p-spectrum kernel. We illustrate the performance of these kernels on text categorization tasks, in which documents are modeled both as bags of words and as sequences of characters. Keywords: positive deﬁnite kernels, nonextensive information theory, Tsallis entropy, JensenShannon divergence, string kernels ∗. Earlier versions of this work appeared in Martins et al.

The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classiﬁcation using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modiﬁcation or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classiﬁcation. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semideﬁnite program. On several data sets of varying size and difﬁculty, we ﬁnd that metrics trained in this way lead to signiﬁcant improvements in kNN classiﬁcation. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.

<p>Author: Eitan Greenshtein, Junyong Park</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of classiﬁcation using high dimensional features’ space. In a paper by Bickel and Levina (2004), it is recommended to use naive-Bayes classiﬁers, that is, to treat the features as if they are statistically independent. Consider now a sparse setup, where only a few of the features are informative for classiﬁcation. Fan and Fan (2008), suggested a variable selection and classiﬁcation method, called FAIR. The FAIR method improves the design of naive-Bayes classiﬁers in sparse setups. The improvement is due to reducing the noise in estimating the features’ means. This reduction is since that only the means of a few selected variables should be estimated. We also consider the design of naive Bayes classiﬁers. We show that a good alternative to variable selection is estimation of the means through a certain non parametric empirical Bayes procedure. In sparse setups the empirical Bayes implicitly performs an efﬁcient variable selection. It also adapts very well to non sparse setups, and has the advantage of making use of the information from many “weakly informative” variables, which variable selection type of classiﬁcation procedures give up on using. We compare our method with FAIR and other classiﬁcation methods in simulation for sparse and non sparse setups, and in real data examples involving classiﬁcation of normal versus malignant tissues based on microarray data.

<p>Author: Wenxin Jiang</p><p>Abstract: The statistical learning theory of risk minimization depends heavily on probability bounds for uniform deviations of the empirical risks. Classical probability bounds using Hoeffding’s inequality cannot accommodate more general situations with unbounded loss and dependent data. The current paper introduces an inequality that extends Hoeffding’s inequality to handle these more general situations. We will apply this inequality to provide probability bounds for uniform deviations in a very general framework, which can involve discrete decision rules, unbounded loss, and a dependence structure that can be more general than either martingale or strong mixing. We will consider two examples with high dimensional predictors: autoregression (AR) with ℓ1 -loss, and ARX model with variable selection for sign classiﬁcation, which uses both lagged responses and exogenous predictors.

<p>Author: Eugene Tuv, Alexander Borisov, George Runger, Kari Torkkola</p><p>Abstract: Predictive models beneﬁt from a compact, non-redundant subset of features that improves interpretability and generalization. Modern data sets are wide, dirty, mixed with both numerical and categorical predictors, and may contain interactive effects that require complex models. This is a challenge for ﬁlters, wrappers, and embedded feature selection methods. We describe details of an algorithm using tree-based ensembles to generate a compact subset of non-redundant features. Parallel and serial ensembles of trees are combined into a mixed method that can uncover masking and detect features of secondary effect. Simulated and actual examples illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

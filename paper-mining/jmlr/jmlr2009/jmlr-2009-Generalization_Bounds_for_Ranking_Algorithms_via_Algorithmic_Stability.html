<p>Author: Cynthia Rudin, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: We study boosting algorithms for learning to rank. We give a general margin-based bound for ranking based on covering numbers for the hypothesis space. Our bound suggests that algorithms that maximize the ranking margin will generalize well. We then describe a new algorithm, smooth margin ranking, that precisely converges to a maximum ranking-margin solution. The algorithm is a modiﬁcation of RankBoost, analogous to “approximate coordinate ascent boosting.” Finally, we prove that AdaBoost and RankBoost are equally good for the problems of bipartite ranking and classiﬁcation in terms of their asymptotic behavior on the training set. Under natural conditions, AdaBoost achieves an area under the ROC curve that is equally as good as RankBoost’s; furthermore, RankBoost, when given a speciﬁc intercept, achieves a misclassiﬁcation error that is as good as AdaBoost’s. This may help to explain the empirical observations made by Cortes and Mohri, and Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, about the excellent performance of AdaBoost as a bipartite ranking algorithm, as measured by the area under the ROC curve.

<p>Author: Ting Hu, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Learning algorithms are based on samples which are often drawn independently from an identical distribution (i.i.d.). In this paper we consider a different setting with samples drawn according to a non-identical sequence of probability distributions. Each time a sample is drawn from a different distribution. In this setting we investigate a fully online learning algorithm associated with a general convex loss function and a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Error analysis is conducted under the assumption that the sequence of marginal distributions converges polynomially in the dual of a H¨ lder space. For regression with least square or insensitive loss, learning rates are given o in both the RKHS norm and the L2 norm. For classiﬁcation with hinge loss and support vector machine q-norm loss, rates are explicitly stated with respect to the excess misclassiﬁcation error.

<p>Author: Jacob Abernethy, Francis Bach, Theodoros Evgeniou, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We present a general approach for collaborative ﬁltering (CF) using spectral regularization to learn linear operators mapping a set of “users” to a set of possibly desired “objects”. In particular, several recent low-rank type matrix-completion methods for CF are shown to be special cases of our proposed framework. Unlike existing regularization-based CF, our approach can be used to incorporate additional information such as attributes of the users/objects—a feature currently lacking in existing regularization-based CF approaches—using popular and well-known kernel methods. We provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods. We then provide learning algorithms based on low-rank decompositions and test them on a standard CF data set. The experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization-based CF methods to incorporate related information about users and objects. Finally, we show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases of our proposed approach.

<p>Author: Shie Mannor, John N. Tsitsiklis, Jia Yuan Yu</p><p>Abstract: We study online learning where a decision maker interacts with Nature with the objective of maximizing her long-term average reward subject to some sample path average constraints. We deﬁne the reward-in-hindsight as the highest reward the decision maker could have achieved, while satisfying the constraints, had she known Nature’s choices in advance. We show that in general the reward-in-hindsight is not attainable. The convex hull of the reward-in-hindsight function is, however, attainable. For the important case of a single constraint, the convex hull turns out to be the highest attainable function. Using a calibrated forecasting rule, we provide an explicit strategy that attains this convex hull. We also measure the performance of heuristic methods based on non-calibrated forecasters in experiments involving a CPU power management problem.

<p>Author: Leslie Foster, Alex Waagen, Nabeela Aijaz, Michael Hurley, Apolonio Luis, Joel Rinsky, Chandrika Satyavolu, Michael J. Way, Paul Gazis, Ashok Srivastava</p><p>Abstract: The use of Gaussian processes can be an effective approach to prediction in a supervised learning environment. For large data sets, the standard Gaussian process approach requires solving very large systems of linear equations and approximations are required for the calculations to be practical. We will focus on the subset of regressors approximation technique. We will demonstrate that there can be numerical instabilities in a well known implementation of the technique. We discuss alternate implementations that have better numerical stability properties and can lead to better predictions. Our results will be illustrated by looking at an application involving prediction of galaxy redshift from broadband spectrum data.

<p>Author: Cynthia Rudin</p><p>Abstract: We are interested in supervised ranking algorithms that perform especially well near the top of the ranked list, and are only required to perform sufﬁciently well on the rest of the list. In this work, we provide a general form of convex objective that gives high-scoring examples more importance. This “push” near the top of the list can be chosen arbitrarily large or small, based on the preference of the user. We choose ℓ p -norms to provide a speciﬁc type of push; if the user sets p larger, the objective concentrates harder on the top of the list. We derive a generalization bound based on the p-norm objective, working around the natural asymmetry of the problem. We then derive a boosting-style algorithm for the problem of ranking with a push at the top. The usefulness of the algorithm is illustrated through experiments on repository data. We prove that the minimizer of the algorithm’s objective is unique in a speciﬁc sense. Furthermore, we illustrate how our objective is related to quality measurements for information retrieval.

<p>Author: Christian Rieger, Barbara Zwicknagl</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new technique for the analysis of kernel-based regression problems. The basic tools are sampling inequalities which apply to all machine learning problems involving penalty terms induced by kernels related to Sobolev spaces. They lead to explicit deterministic results concerning the worst case behaviour of ε- and ν-SVRs. Using these, we show how to adjust regularization parameters to get best possible approximation orders for regression. The results are illustrated by some numerical examples.

We study generalization properties of ranking algorithms using the notion of algorithmic stability; in particular, we derive generalization bounds for ranking algorithms that have good stability properties. We show that kernel-based ranking algorithms that perform regularization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space have such stability properties, and therefore our bounds can be applied to these algorithms; this is in contrast with generalization bounds based on uniform convergence, which in many cases cannot be applied to these algorithms. Our results generalize earlier results that were derived in the special setting of bipartite ranking (Agarwal and Niyogi, 2005) to a more general setting of the ranking problem that arises frequently in applications.

<p>Author: Gilles Blanchard,  Étienne Roquain</p><p>Abstract: In the context of multiple hypothesis testing, the proportion π0 of true null hypotheses in the pool of hypotheses to test often plays a crucial role, although it is generally unknown a priori. A testing procedure using an implicit or explicit estimate of this quantity in order to improve its efﬁcency is called adaptive. In this paper, we focus on the issue of false discovery rate (FDR) control and we present new adaptive multiple testing procedures with control of the FDR. In a ﬁrst part, assuming independence of the p-values, we present two new procedures and give a uniﬁed review of other existing adaptive procedures that have provably controlled FDR. We report extensive simulation results comparing these procedures and testing their robustness when the independence assumption is violated. The new proposed procedures appear competitive with existing ones. The overall best, though, is reported to be Storey’s estimator, albeit for a speciﬁc parameter setting that does not appear to have been considered before. In a second part, we propose adaptive versions of step-up procedures that have provably controlled FDR under positive dependence and unspeciﬁed dependence of the p-values, respectively. In the latter case, while simulations only show an improvement over non-adaptive procedures in limited situations, these are to our knowledge among the ﬁrst theoretically founded adaptive multiple testing procedures that control the FDR when the p-values are not independent.

<p>Author: Leonid (Aryeh) Kontorovich, Boaz Nadler</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for supervised learning of discrete concepts. Since the 1970’s, the standard computational primitive has been to ﬁnd the most consistent hypothesis in a given complexity class. In contrast, in this paper we propose a new basic operation: for each pair of input instances, count how many concepts of bounded complexity contain both of them. Our approach maps instances to a Hilbert space, whose metric is induced by a universal kernel coinciding with our computational primitive, and identiﬁes concepts with half-spaces. We prove that all concepts are linearly separable under this mapping. Hence, given a labeled sample and an oracle for evaluating the universal kernel, we can efﬁciently compute a linear classiﬁer (via SVM, for example) and use margin bounds to control its generalization error. Even though exact evaluation of the universal kernel may be infeasible, in various natural situations it is efﬁciently approximable. Though our approach is general, our main application is to regular languages. Our approach presents a substantial departure from current learning paradigms and in particular yields a novel method for learning this fundamental concept class. Unlike existing techniques, we make no structural assumptions on the corresponding unknown automata, the string distribution or the completeness of the training set. Instead, given a labeled sample our algorithm outputs a classiﬁer with guaranteed distribution-free generalization bounds; to our knowledge, the proposed framework is the only one capable of achieving the latter. Along the way, we touch upon several fundamental questions in complexity, automata, and machine learning.

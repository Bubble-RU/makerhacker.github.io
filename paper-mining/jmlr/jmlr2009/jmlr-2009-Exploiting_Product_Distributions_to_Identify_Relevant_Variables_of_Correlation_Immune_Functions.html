<p>Author: Jonathan Huang, Carlos Guestrin, Leonidas Guibas</p><p>Abstract: Permutations are ubiquitous in many real-world problems, such as voting, ranking, and data association. Representing uncertainty over permutations is challenging, since there are n! possibilities, and typical compact and factorized probability distribution representations, such as graphical models, cannot capture the mutual exclusivity constraints associated with permutations. In this paper, we use the “low-frequency” terms of a Fourier decomposition to represent distributions over permutations compactly. We present Kronecker conditioning, a novel approach for maintaining and updating these distributions directly in the Fourier domain, allowing for polynomial time bandlimited approximations. Low order Fourier-based approximations, however, may lead to functions that do not correspond to valid distributions. To address this problem, we present a quadratic program deﬁned directly in the Fourier domain for projecting the approximation onto a relaxation of the polytope of legal marginal distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real camera-based multi-person tracking scenario.

<p>Author: Vitaly Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We study the properties of the agnostic learning framework of Haussler (1992) and Kearns, Schapire, and Sellie (1994). In particular, we address the question: is there any situation in which membership queries are useful in agnostic learning? Our results show that the answer is negative for distribution-independent agnostic learning and positive for agnostic learning with respect to a speciﬁc marginal distribution. Namely, we give a simple proof that any concept class learnable agnostically by a distribution-independent algorithm with access to membership queries is also learnable agnostically without membership queries. This resolves an open problem posed by Kearns et al. (1994). For agnostic learning with respect to the uniform distribution over {0, 1}n we show a concept class that is learnable with membership queries but computationally hard to learn from random examples alone (assuming that one-way functions exist).

<p>Author: Jacob Abernethy, Francis Bach, Theodoros Evgeniou, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We present a general approach for collaborative ﬁltering (CF) using spectral regularization to learn linear operators mapping a set of “users” to a set of possibly desired “objects”. In particular, several recent low-rank type matrix-completion methods for CF are shown to be special cases of our proposed framework. Unlike existing regularization-based CF, our approach can be used to incorporate additional information such as attributes of the users/objects—a feature currently lacking in existing regularization-based CF approaches—using popular and well-known kernel methods. We provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods. We then provide learning algorithms based on low-rank decompositions and test them on a standard CF data set. The experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization-based CF methods to incorporate related information about users and objects. Finally, we show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases of our proposed approach.

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the feature selection problem using a greedy least squares regression algorithm. We show that under a certain irrepresentable condition on the design matrix (but independent of the sparse target), the greedy algorithm can select features consistently when the sample size approaches inﬁnity. The condition is identical to a corresponding condition for Lasso. Moreover, under a sparse eigenvalue condition, the greedy algorithm can reliably identify features as long as each nonzero coefﬁcient is larger than a constant times the noise level. In compar√ ison, Lasso may require the coefﬁcients to be larger than O( s) times the noise level in the worst case, where s is the number of nonzero coefﬁcients.

<p>Author: André F. T. Martins, Noah A. Smith, Eric P. Xing, Pedro M. Q. Aguiar, Mário A. T. Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: Positive deﬁnite kernels on probability measures have been recently applied to classiﬁcation problems involving text, images, and other types of structured data. Some of these kernels are related to classic information theoretic quantities, such as (Shannon’s) mutual information and the JensenShannon (JS) divergence. Meanwhile, there have been recent advances in nonextensive generalizations of Shannon’s information theory. This paper bridges these two trends by introducing nonextensive information theoretic kernels on probability measures, based on new JS-type divergences. These new divergences result from extending the the two building blocks of the classical JS divergence: convexity and Shannon’s entropy. The notion of convexity is extended to the wider concept of q-convexity, for which we prove a Jensen q-inequality. Based on this inequality, we introduce Jensen-Tsallis (JT) q-differences, a nonextensive generalization of the JS divergence, and deﬁne a k-th order JT q-difference between stochastic processes. We then deﬁne a new family of nonextensive mutual information kernels, which allow weights to be assigned to their arguments, and which includes the Boolean, JS, and linear kernels as particular cases. Nonextensive string kernels are also deﬁned that generalize the p-spectrum kernel. We illustrate the performance of these kernels on text categorization tasks, in which documents are modeled both as bags of words and as sequences of characters.

<p>Author: Lisa Hellerstein, Bernard Rosell, Eric Bach, Soumya Ray, David Page</p><p>Abstract: A Boolean function f is correlation immune if each input variable is independent of the output, under the uniform distribution on inputs. For example, the parity function is correlation immune. We consider the problem of identifying relevant variables of a correlation immune function, in the presence of irrelevant variables. We address this problem in two different contexts. First, we analyze Skewing, a heuristic method that was developed to improve the ability of greedy decision tree algorithms to identify relevant variables of correlation immune Boolean functions, given examples drawn from the uniform distribution (Page and Ray, 2003). We present theoretical results revealing both the capabilities and limitations of skewing. Second, we explore the problem of identifying relevant variables in the Product Distribution Choice (PDC) learning model, a model in which the learner can choose product distributions and obtain examples from them. We prove a lemma establishing a property of Boolean functions that may be of independent interest. Using this lemma, we give two new algorithms for ﬁnding relevant variables of correlation immune functions in the PDC model.

<p>Author: Alexander L. Strehl, Lihong Li, Michael L. Littman</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning near-optimal behavior in ﬁnite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a polynomial number of samples. These “PAC-MDP” algorithms include the wellknown E3 and R-MAX algorithms as well as the more recent Delayed Q-learning algorithm. We summarize the current state-of-the-art by presenting bounds for the problem in a uniﬁed theoretical framework. A more reﬁned analysis for upper and lower bounds is presented to yield insight into the differences between the model-free Delayed Q-learning and the model-based R-MAX.

<p>Author: Yuehua Xu, Alan Fern, Sungwook Yoon</p><p>Abstract: Beam search is commonly used to help maintain tractability in large search spaces at the expense of completeness and optimality. Here we study supervised learning of linear ranking functions for controlling beam search. The goal is to learn ranking functions that allow for beam search to perform nearly as well as unconstrained search, and hence gain computational efﬁciency without seriously sacriﬁcing optimality. In this paper, we develop theoretical aspects of this learning problem and investigate the application of this framework to learning in the context of automated planning. We ﬁrst study the computational complexity of the learning problem, showing that even for exponentially large search spaces the general consistency problem is in NP. We also identify tractable and intractable subclasses of the learning problem, giving insight into the problem structure. Next, we analyze the convergence of recently proposed and modiﬁed online learning algorithms, where we introduce several notions of problem margin that imply convergence for the various algorithms. Finally, we present empirical results in automated planning, where ranking functions are learned to guide beam search in a number of benchmark planning domains. The results show that our approach is often able to outperform an existing state-of-the-art planning heuristic as well as a recent approach to learning such heuristics.

<p>Author: Sanjoy Dasgupta, Adam Tauman Kalai, Claire Monteleoni</p><p>Abstract: We start by showing that in an active learning setting, the Perceptron algorithm needs Ω( ε12 ) labels to learn linear separators within generalization error ε. We then present a simple active learning algorithm for this problem, which combines a modiﬁcation of the Perceptron update with an adaptive ﬁltering rule for deciding which points to query. For data distributed uniformly over the unit ˜ sphere, we show that our algorithm reaches generalization error ε after asking for just O(d log 1 ) ε labels. This exponential improvement over the usual sample complexity of supervised learning had previously been demonstrated only for the computationally more complex query-by-committee algorithm.

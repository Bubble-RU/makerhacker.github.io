<p>Author: Steffen Bickel, Michael Brückner, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address classiﬁcation problems for which the training instances are governed by an input distribution that is allowed to differ arbitrarily from the test distribution—problems also referred to as classiﬁcation under covariate shift. We derive a solution that is purely discriminative: neither training nor test distribution are modeled explicitly. The problem of learning under covariate shift can be written as an integrated optimization problem. Instantiating the general optimization problem leads to a kernel logistic regression and an exponential model classiﬁer for covariate shift. The optimization problem is convex under certain conditions; our ﬁndings also clarify the relationship to the known kernel mean matching procedure. We report on experiments on problems of spam ﬁltering, text classiﬁcation, and landmine detection.

<p>Author: Brijnesh J. Jain, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Finite structures such as point patterns, strings, trees, and graphs occur as ”natural” representations of structured data in different application areas of machine learning. We develop the theory of structure spaces and derive geometrical and analytical concepts such as the angle between structures and the derivative of functions on structures. In particular, we show that the gradient of a differentiable structural function is a well-deﬁned structure pointing in the direction of steepest ascent. Exploiting the properties of structure spaces, it will turn out that a number of problems in structural pattern recognition such as central clustering or learning in structured output spaces can be formulated as optimization problems with cost functions that are locally Lipschitz. Hence, methods from nonsmooth analysis are applicable to optimize those cost functions.

<p>Author: John Langford, Lihong Li, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of onlinelearning algorithms with convex loss functions. This method has several essential properties: 1. The degree of sparsity is continuous—a parameter controls the rate of sparsiﬁcation from no sparsiﬁcation to total sparsiﬁcation. 2. The approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1 -regularization method in the batch setting. We prove that small rates of sparsiﬁcation result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. 3. The approach works well empirically. We apply the approach to several data sets and ﬁnd for data sets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable.

<p>Author: Holger Höfling, Robert Tibshirani</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problems of estimating the parameters as well as the structure of binary-valued Markov networks. For maximizing the penalized log-likelihood, we implement an approximate procedure based on the pseudo-likelihood of Besag (1975) and generalize it to a fast exact algorithm. The exact algorithm starts with the pseudo-likelihood solution and then adjusts the pseudolikelihood criterion so that each additional iterations moves it closer to the exact solution. Our results show that this procedure is faster than the competing exact method proposed by Lee, Ganapathi, and Koller (2006a). However, we also ﬁnd that the approximate pseudo-likelihood as well as the approaches of Wainwright et al. (2006), when implemented using the coordinate descent procedure of Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2008b), are much faster than the exact methods, and only slightly less accurate.

Therefore its unique advantages such as dual sparseness and kernel tricks cannot be easily conjoined with the merits of a probabilistic model such as Bayesian regularization, model averaging, and ability to model hidden variables. In this paper, we present a new general framework called maximum entropy discrimination Markov networks (MaxEnDNet, or simply, MEDN), which integrates these two approaches and combines and extends their merits. Major innovations of this approach include: 1) It extends the conventional max-entropy discrimination learning of classiﬁcation rules to a new structural maxentropy discrimination paradigm of learning a distribution of Markov networks. 2) It generalizes the extant Markov network structured-prediction rule based on a point estimator of model coefﬁcients to an averaging model akin to a Bayesian predictor that integrates over a learned posterior distribution of model coefﬁcients. 3) It admits ﬂexible entropic regularization of the model during learning. By plugging in different prior distributions of the model coefﬁcients, it subsumes the wellknown maximum margin Markov networks (M3 N) as a special case, and leads to a model similar to an L1 -regularized M3 N that is simultaneously primal and dual sparse, or other new types of Markov networks. 4) It applies a modular learning algorithm that combines existing variational inference techniques and convex-optimization based M3 N solvers as subroutines. Essentially, MEDN can be understood as a jointly maximum likelihood and maximum margin estimate of Markov network. It represents the ﬁrst successful attempt to combine maximum entropy learning (a dual form of maximum likelihood learning) with maximum margin learning of Markov network for structured input/output problems; and the basic principle can be generalized to learning arbi</p><p>2 0.41714206 <a title="55-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2009-CarpeDiem%3A_Optimizing_the_Viterbi_Algorithm_and_Applications_to_Supervised_Sequential_Learning.html">14 jmlr-2009-CarpeDiem: Optimizing the Viterbi Algorithm and Applications to Supervised Sequential Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Roberto Esposito, Daniele P. Radicioni</p><p>Abstract: The growth of information available to learning systems and the increasing complexity of learning tasks determine the need for devising algorithms that scale well with respect to all learning parameters. In the context of supervised sequential learning, the Viterbi algorithm plays a fundamental role, by allowing the evaluation of the best (most probable) sequence of labels with a time complexity linear in the number of time events, and quadratic in the number of labels. In this paper we propose CarpeDiem, a novel algorithm allowing the evaluation of the best possible sequence of labels with a sub-quadratic time complexity.1 We provide theoretical grounding together with solid empirical results supporting two chief facts. CarpeDiem always ﬁnds the optimal solution requiring, in most cases, only a small fraction of the time taken by the Viterbi algorithm; meantime, CarpeDiem is never asymptotically worse than the Viterbi algorithm, thus conﬁrming it as a sound replacement.

<p>Author: Eugene Tuv, Alexander Borisov, George Runger, Kari Torkkola</p><p>Abstract: Predictive models beneﬁt from a compact, non-redundant subset of features that improves interpretability and generalization. Modern data sets are wide, dirty, mixed with both numerical and categorical predictors, and may contain interactive effects that require complex models. This is a challenge for ﬁlters, wrappers, and embedded feature selection methods. We describe details of an algorithm using tree-based ensembles to generate a compact subset of non-redundant features. Parallel and serial ensembles of trees are combined into a mixed method that can uncover masking and detect features of secondary effect. Simulated and actual examples illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

<p>Author: David Newman, Arthur Asuncion, Padhraic Smyth, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: We describe distributed algorithms for two widely-used topic models, namely the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, and the Hierarchical Dirichet Process (HDP) model. In our distributed algorithms the data is partitioned across separate processors and inference is done in a parallel, distributed fashion. We propose two distributed algorithms for LDA. The ﬁrst algorithm is a straightforward mapping of LDA to a distributed processor setting. In this algorithm processors concurrently perform Gibbs sampling over local data followed by a global update of topic counts. The algorithm is simple to implement and can be viewed as an approximation to Gibbs-sampled LDA. The second version is a model that uses a hierarchical Bayesian extension of LDA to directly account for distributed data. This model has a theoretical guarantee of convergence but is more complex to implement than the ﬁrst algorithm. Our distributed algorithm for HDP takes the straightforward mapping approach, and merges newly-created topics either by matching or by topic-id. Using ﬁve real-world text corpora we show that distributed learning works well in practice. For both LDA and HDP, we show that the converged test-data log probability for distributed learning is indistinguishable from that obtained with single-processor learning. Our extensive experimental results include learning topic models for two multi-million document collections using a 1024-processor parallel computer.

<p>Author: Luciana Ferrer, Kemal Sönmez, Elizabeth Shriberg</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for training support vector machine (SVM)-based classiﬁcation systems for combination with other classiﬁcation systems designed for the same task. Ideally, a new system should be designed such that, when combined with existing systems, the resulting performance is optimized. We present a simple model for this problem and use the understanding gained from this analysis to propose a method to achieve better combination performance when training SVM systems. We include a regularization term in the SVM objective function that aims to reduce the average class-conditional covariance between the resulting scores and the scores produced by the existing systems, introducing a trade-off between such covariance and the system’s individual performance. That is, the new system “takes one for the team”, falling somewhat short of its best possible performance in order to increase the diversity of the ensemble. We report results on the NIST 2005 and 2006 speaker recognition evaluations (SREs) for a variety of subsystems. We show a gain of 19% on the equal error rate (EER) of a combination of four systems when applying the proposed method with respect to the performance obtained when the four systems are trained independently of each other. Keywords: system combination, ensemble diversity, multiple classiﬁer systems, support vector machines, speaker recognition, kernel methods ∗.

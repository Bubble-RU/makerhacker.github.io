<p>Author: Petra Kralj Novak, Nada Lavrač, Geoffrey I. Webb</p><p>Abstract: This paper gives a survey of contrast set mining (CSM), emerging pattern mining (EPM), and subgroup discovery (SD) in a unifying framework named supervised descriptive rule discovery. While all these research areas aim at discovering patterns in the form of rules induced from labeled data, they use different terminology and task deﬁnitions, claim to have different goals, claim to use different rule learning heuristics, and use different means for selecting subsets of induced patterns. This paper contributes a novel understanding of these subareas of data mining by presenting a uniﬁed terminology, by explaining the apparent differences between the learning tasks as variants of a unique supervised descriptive rule discovery task and by exploring the apparent differences between the approaches. It also shows that various rule learning heuristics used in CSM, EPM and SD algorithms all aim at optimizing a trade off between rule coverage and precision. The commonalities (and differences) between the approaches are showcased on a selection of best known variants of CSM, EPM and SD algorithms. The paper also provides a critical survey of existing supervised descriptive rule discovery visualization methods.

<p>Author: Kristian Woodsend, Jacek Gondzio</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines are a powerful machine learning technology, but the training process involves a dense quadratic optimization problem and is computationally challenging. A parallel implementation of linear Support Vector Machine training has been developed, using a combination of MPI and OpenMP. Using an interior point method for the optimization and a reformulation that avoids the dense Hessian matrix, the structure of the augmented system matrix is exploited to partition data and computations amongst parallel processors efﬁciently. The new implementation has been applied to solve problems from the PASCAL Challenge on Large-scale Learning. We show that our approach is competitive, and is able to solve problems in the Challenge many times faster than other parallel approaches. We also demonstrate that the hybrid version performs more efﬁciently than the version using pure MPI.

<p>Author: Zeeshan Syed, Piotr Indyk, John Guttag</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an automated approach to discover patterns that can distinguish between sequences belonging to different labeled groups. Our method searches for approximately conserved motifs that occur with varying statistical properties in positive and negative training examples. We propose a two-step process to discover such patterns. Using locality sensitive hashing (LSH), we ﬁrst estimate the frequency of all subsequences and their approximate matches within a given Hamming radius in labeled examples. The discriminative ability of each pattern is then assessed from the estimated frequencies by concordance and rank sum testing. The use of LSH to identify approximate matches for each candidate pattern helps reduce the runtime of our method. Space requirements are reduced by decomposing the search problem into an iterative method that uses a single LSH table in memory. We propose two further optimizations to the search for discriminative patterns. Clustering with redundancy based on a 2-approximate solution of the k-center problem decreases the number of overlapping approximate groups while providing exhaustive coverage of the search space. Sequential statistical methods allow the search process to use data from only as many training examples as are needed to assess signiﬁcance. We evaluated our algorithm on data sets from different applications to discover sequential patterns for classiﬁcation. On nucleotide sequences from the Drosophila genome compared with random background sequences, our method was able to discover approximate binding sites that were preserved upstream of genes. We observed a similar result in experiments on ChIP-on-chip data. For cardiovascular data from patients admitted with acute coronary syndromes, our pattern discovery approach identiﬁed approximately conserved sequences of morphology variations that were predictive of future death in a test population.

<p>Author: Nikolai Slobodianik, Dmitry Zaporozhets, Neal Madras</p><p>Abstract: In the machine learning community, the Bayesian scoring criterion is widely used for model selection problems. One of the fundamental theoretical properties justifying the usage of the Bayesian scoring criterion is its consistency. In this paper we reﬁne this property for the case of binomial Bayesian network models. As a by-product of our derivations we establish strong consistency and obtain the law of iterated logarithm for the Bayesian scoring criterion.

<p>Author: Dirk Gorissen, Tom Dhaene, Filip De Turck</p><p>Abstract: Due to the scale and computational complexity of currently used simulation codes, global surrogate (metamodels) models have become indispensable tools for exploring and understanding the design space. Due to their compact formulation they are cheap to evaluate and thus readily facilitate visualization, design space exploration, rapid prototyping, and sensitivity analysis. They can also be used as accurate building blocks in design packages or larger simulation environments. Consequently, there is great interest in techniques that facilitate the construction of such approximation models while minimizing the computational cost and maximizing model accuracy. Many surrogate model types exist (Support Vector Machines, Kriging, Neural Networks, etc.) but no type is optimal in all circumstances. Nor is there any hard theory available that can help make this choice. In this paper we present an automatic approach to the model type selection problem. We describe an adaptive global surrogate modeling environment with adaptive sampling, driven by speciated evolution. Different model types are evolved cooperatively using a Genetic Algorithm (heterogeneous evolution) and compete to approximate the iteratively selected data. In this way the optimal model type and complexity for a given data set or simulation code can be dynamically determined. Its utility and performance is demonstrated on a number of problems where it outperforms traditional sequential execution of each model type.

<p>Author: Stijn Goedertier, David Martens, Jan Vanthienen, Bart Baesens</p><p>Abstract: Process discovery is the automated construction of structured process models from information system event logs. Such event logs often contain positive examples only. Without negative examples, it is a challenge to strike the right balance between recall and speciﬁcity, and to deal with problems such as expressiveness, noise, incomplete event logs, or the inclusion of prior knowledge. In this paper, we present a conﬁgurable technique that deals with these challenges by representing process discovery as a multi-relational classiﬁcation problem on event logs supplemented with Artiﬁcially Generated Negative Events (AGNEs). This problem formulation allows using learning algorithms and evaluation techniques that are well-know in the machine learning community. Moreover, it allows users to have a declarative control over the inductive bias and language bias.

<p>Author: Zeeshan Syed, Piotr Indyk, John Guttag</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an automated approach to discover patterns that can distinguish between sequences belonging to different labeled groups. Our method searches for approximately conserved motifs that occur with varying statistical properties in positive and negative training examples. We propose a two-step process to discover such patterns. Using locality sensitive hashing (LSH), we ﬁrst estimate the frequency of all subsequences and their approximate matches within a given Hamming radius in labeled examples. The discriminative ability of each pattern is then assessed from the estimated frequencies by concordance and rank sum testing. The use of LSH to identify approximate matches for each candidate pattern helps reduce the runtime of our method. Space requirements are reduced by decomposing the search problem into an iterative method that uses a single LSH table in memory. We propose two further optimizations to the search for discriminative patterns. Clustering with redundancy based on a 2-approximate solution of the k-center problem decreases the number of overlapping approximate groups while providing exhaustive coverage of the search space. Sequential statistical methods allow the search process to use data from only as many training examples as are needed to assess signiﬁcance. We evaluated our algorithm on data sets from different applications to discover sequential patterns for classiﬁcation. On nucleotide sequences from the Drosophila genome compared with random background sequences, our method was able to discover approximate binding sites that were preserved upstream of genes. We observed a similar result in experiments on ChIP-on-chip data. For cardiovascular data from patients admitted with acute coronary syndromes, our pattern discovery approach identiﬁed approximately conserved sequences of morphology variations that were predictive of future death in a test population. Our data showed that the use of LSH, clustering, and sequential statistic</p><p>3 0.40781787 <a title="81-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2009-Supervised_Descriptive_Rule_Discovery%3A_A_Unifying_Survey_of_Contrast_Set%2C_Emerging_Pattern_and_Subgroup_Mining.html">92 jmlr-2009-Supervised Descriptive Rule Discovery: A Unifying Survey of Contrast Set, Emerging Pattern and Subgroup Mining</a></p>
<p>Author: Petra Kralj Novak, Nada Lavrač, Geoffrey I. Webb</p><p>Abstract: This paper gives a survey of contrast set mining (CSM), emerging pattern mining (EPM), and subgroup discovery (SD) in a unifying framework named supervised descriptive rule discovery. While all these research areas aim at discovering patterns in the form of rules induced from labeled data, they use different terminology and task deﬁnitions, claim to have different goals, claim to use different rule learning heuristics, and use different means for selecting subsets of induced patterns. This paper contributes a novel understanding of these subareas of data mining by presenting a uniﬁed terminology, by explaining the apparent differences between the learning tasks as variants of a unique supervised descriptive rule discovery task and by exploring the apparent differences between the approaches. It also shows that various rule learning heuristics used in CSM, EPM and SD algorithms all aim at optimizing a trade off between rule coverage and precision. The commonalities (and differences) between the approaches are showcased on a selection of best known variants of CSM, EPM and SD algorithms. The paper also provides a critical survey of existing supervised descriptive rule discovery visualization methods.

<p>Author: Yuehua Xu, Alan Fern, Sungwook Yoon</p><p>Abstract: Beam search is commonly used to help maintain tractability in large search spaces at the expense of completeness and optimality. Here we study supervised learning of linear ranking functions for controlling beam search. The goal is to learn ranking functions that allow for beam search to perform nearly as well as unconstrained search, and hence gain computational efﬁciency without seriously sacriﬁcing optimality. In this paper, we develop theoretical aspects of this learning problem and investigate the application of this framework to learning in the context of automated planning. We ﬁrst study the computational complexity of the learning problem, showing that even for exponentially large search spaces the general consistency problem is in NP. We also identify tractable and intractable subclasses of the learning problem, giving insight into the problem structure. Next, we analyze the convergence of recently proposed and modiﬁed online learning algorithms, where we introduce several notions of problem margin that imply convergence for the various algorithms. Finally, we present empirical results in automated planning, where ranking functions are learned to guide beam search in a number of benchmark planning domains. The results show that our approach is often able to outperform an existing state-of-the-art planning heuristic as well as a recent approach to learning such heuristics.

<p>Author: Roberto Esposito, Daniele P. Radicioni</p><p>Abstract: The growth of information available to learning systems and the increasing complexity of learning tasks determine the need for devising algorithms that scale well with respect to all learning parameters. In the context of supervised sequential learning, the Viterbi algorithm plays a fundamental role, by allowing the evaluation of the best (most probable) sequence of labels with a time complexity linear in the number of time events, and quadratic in the number of labels. In this paper we propose CarpeDiem, a novel algorithm allowing the evaluation of the best possible sequence of labels with a sub-quadratic time complexity.1 We provide theoretical grounding together with solid empirical results supporting two chief facts. CarpeDiem always ﬁnds the optimal solution requiring, in most cases, only a small fraction of the time taken by the Viterbi algorithm; meantime, CarpeDiem is never asymptotically worse than the Viterbi algorithm, thus conﬁrming it as a sound replacement.

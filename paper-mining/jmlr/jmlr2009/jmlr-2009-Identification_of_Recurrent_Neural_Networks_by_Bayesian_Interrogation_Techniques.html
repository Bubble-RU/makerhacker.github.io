We develop the theory of structure spaces and derive geometrical and analytical concepts such as the angle between structures and the derivative of functions on structures. In particular, we show that the gradient of a differentiable structural function is a well-deﬁned structure pointing in the direction of steepest ascent. Exploiting the properties of structure spaces, it will turn out that a number of problems in structural pattern recognition such as central clustering or learning in structured output spaces can be formulated as optimization problems with cost functions that are locally Lipschitz. Hence, methods from nonsmooth analysis are applicable to optimize those cost functions.

<p>Author: Francesco Orabona, Joseph Keshet, Barbara Caputo</p><p>Abstract: A common problem of kernel-based online algorithms, such as the kernel-based Perceptron algorithm, is the amount of memory required to store the online hypothesis, which may increase without bound as the algorithm progresses. Furthermore, the computational load of such algorithms grows linearly with the amount of memory used to store the hypothesis. To attack these problems, most previous work has focused on discarding some of the instances, in order to keep the memory bounded. In this paper we present a new algorithm, in which the instances are not discarded, but are instead projected onto the space spanned by the previous online hypothesis. We call this algorithm Projectron. While the memory size of the Projectron solution cannot be predicted before training, we prove that its solution is guaranteed to be bounded. We derive a relative mistake bound for the proposed algorithm, and deduce from it a slightly different algorithm which outperforms the Perceptron. We call this second algorithm Projectron++. We show that this algorithm can be extended to handle the multiclass and the structured output settings, resulting, as far as we know, in the ﬁrst online bounded algorithm that can learn complex classiﬁcation tasks. The method of bounding the hypothesis representation can be applied to any conservative online algorithm and to other online algorithms, as it is demonstrated for ALMA2 . Experimental results on various data sets show the empirical advantage of our technique compared to various bounded online algorithms, both in terms of memory and accuracy.

<p>Author: Alexander L. Strehl, Lihong Li, Michael L. Littman</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning near-optimal behavior in ﬁnite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a polynomial number of samples. These “PAC-MDP” algorithms include the wellknown E3 and R-MAX algorithms as well as the more recent Delayed Q-learning algorithm. We summarize the current state-of-the-art by presenting bounds for the problem in a uniﬁed theoretical framework. A more reﬁned analysis for upper and lower bounds is presented to yield insight into the differences between the model-free Delayed Q-learning and the model-based R-MAX.

<p>Author: Wenxin Jiang</p><p>Abstract: The statistical learning theory of risk minimization depends heavily on probability bounds for uniform deviations of the empirical risks. Classical probability bounds using Hoeffding’s inequality cannot accommodate more general situations with unbounded loss and dependent data. The current paper introduces an inequality that extends Hoeffding’s inequality to handle these more general situations. We will apply this inequality to provide probability bounds for uniform deviations in a very general framework, which can involve discrete decision rules, unbounded loss, and a dependence structure that can be more general than either martingale or strong mixing. We will consider two examples with high dimensional predictors: autoregression (AR) with ℓ1 -loss, and ARX model with variable selection for sign classiﬁcation, which uses both lagged responses and exogenous predictors.

<p>Author: Brian Kulis, Mátyás A. Sustik, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study low-rank matrix nearness problems, with a focus on learning low-rank positive semideﬁnite (kernel) matrices for machine learning applications. We propose efﬁcient algorithms that scale linearly in the number of data points and quadratically in the rank of the input matrix. Existing algorithms for learning kernel matrices often scale poorly, with running times that are cubic in the number of data points. We employ Bregman matrix divergences as the measures of nearness—these divergences are natural for learning low-rank kernels since they preserve rank as well as positive semideﬁniteness. Special cases of our framework yield faster algorithms for various existing learning problems, and experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms can effectively learn both low-rank and full-rank kernel matrices.

<p>Author: Roberto Esposito, Daniele P. Radicioni</p><p>Abstract: The growth of information available to learning systems and the increasing complexity of learning tasks determine the need for devising algorithms that scale well with respect to all learning parameters. In the context of supervised sequential learning, the Viterbi algorithm plays a fundamental role, by allowing the evaluation of the best (most probable) sequence of labels with a time complexity linear in the number of time events, and quadratic in the number of labels. In this paper we propose CarpeDiem, a novel algorithm allowing the evaluation of the best possible sequence of labels with a sub-quadratic time complexity.1 We provide theoretical grounding together with solid empirical results supporting two chief facts. CarpeDiem always ﬁnds the optimal solution requiring, in most cases, only a small fraction of the time taken by the Viterbi algorithm; meantime, CarpeDiem is never asymptotically worse than the Viterbi algorithm, thus conﬁrming it as a sound replacement.

Employing conjugate priors our derivations remain approximation-free and give rise to simple update rules for the online learning of the parameters. The efﬁciency of our method is demonstrated for a number of selected cases, including the task of controlled independent component analysis.

<p>Author: Ting Hu, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Learning algorithms are based on samples which are often drawn independently from an identical distribution (i.i.d.). In this paper we consider a different setting with samples drawn according to a non-identical sequence of probability distributions. Each time a sample is drawn from a different distribution. In this setting we investigate a fully online learning algorithm associated with a general convex loss function and a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Error analysis is conducted under the assumption that the sequence of marginal distributions converges polynomially in the dual of a H¨ lder space. For regression with least square or insensitive loss, learning rates are given o in both the RKHS norm and the L2 norm. For classiﬁcation with hinge loss and support vector machine q-norm loss, rates are explicitly stated with respect to the excess misclassiﬁcation error.

<p>Author: Kilian Q. Weinberger, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: The accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁcation depends signiﬁcantly on the metric used to compute distances between different examples. In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classiﬁcation from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classiﬁcation using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modiﬁcation or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classiﬁcation. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semideﬁnite program. On several data sets of varying size and difﬁculty, we ﬁnd that metrics trained in this way lead to signiﬁcant improvements in kNN classiﬁcation. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.

<p>Author: Eitan Greenshtein, Junyong Park</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of classiﬁcation using high dimensional features’ space. In a paper by Bickel and Levina (2004), it is recommended to use naive-Bayes classiﬁers, that is, to treat the features as if they are statistically independent. Consider now a sparse setup, where only a few of the features are informative for classiﬁcation. Fan and Fan (2008), suggested a variable selection and classiﬁcation method, called FAIR. The FAIR method improves the design of naive-Bayes classiﬁers in sparse setups. The improvement is due to reducing the noise in estimating the features’ means. This reduction is since that only the means of a few selected variables should be estimated. We also consider the design of naive Bayes classiﬁers. We show that a good alternative to variable selection is estimation of the means through a certain non parametric empirical Bayes procedure. In sparse setups the empirical Bayes implicitly performs an efﬁcient variable selection. It also adapts very well to non sparse setups, and has the advantage of making use of the information from many “weakly informative” variables, which variable selection type of classiﬁcation procedures give up on using. We compare our method with FAIR and other classiﬁcation methods in simulation for sparse and non sparse setups, and in real data examples involving classiﬁcation of normal versus malignant tissues based on microarray data.

<p>Author: Wenxin Jiang</p><p>Abstract: The statistical learning theory of risk minimization depends heavily on probability bounds for uniform deviations of the empirical risks. Classical probability bounds using Hoeffding’s inequality cannot accommodate more general situations with unbounded loss and dependent data. The current paper introduces an inequality that extends Hoeffding’s inequality to handle these more general situations. We will apply this inequality to provide probability bounds for uniform deviations in a very general framework, which can involve discrete decision rules, unbounded loss, and a dependence structure that can be more general than either martingale or strong mixing. We will consider two examples with high dimensional predictors: autoregression (AR) with ℓ1 -loss, and ARX model with variable selection for sign classiﬁcation, which uses both lagged responses and exogenous predictors.

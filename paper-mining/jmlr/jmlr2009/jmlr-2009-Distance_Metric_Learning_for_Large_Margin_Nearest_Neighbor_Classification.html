<h1>24 jmlr-2009-Distance Metric Learning for Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification</h1>

Saul</p><p>Abstract: The accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁcation depends signiﬁcantly on the metric used to compute distances between different examples. In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classiﬁcation from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classiﬁcation using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modiﬁcation or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classiﬁcation. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semideﬁnite program. On several data sets of varying size and difﬁculty, we ﬁnd that metrics trained in this way lead to signiﬁcant improvements in kNN classiﬁcation. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster.

<p>Author: Jie Chen, Haw-ren Fang, Yousef Saad</p><p>Abstract: Nearest neighbor graphs are widely used in data mining and machine learning. A brute-force method to compute the exact kNN graph takes Θ(dn2 ) time for n data points in the d dimensional Euclidean space. We propose two divide and conquer methods for computing an approximate kNN graph in Θ(dnt ) time for high dimensional data (large d). The exponent t ∈ (1, 2) is an increasing function of an internal parameter α which governs the size of the common region in the divide step. Experiments show that a high quality graph can usually be obtained with small overlaps, that is, for small values of t. A few of the practical details of the algorithms are as follows. First, the divide step uses an inexpensive Lanczos procedure to perform recursive spectral bisection. After each conquer step, an additional reﬁnement step is performed to improve the accuracy of the graph. Finally, a hash table is used to avoid repeating distance calculations during the divide and conquer process. The combination of these techniques is shown to yield quite effective algorithms for building kNN graphs.

<p>Author: Brijnesh J. Jain, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Finite structures such as point patterns, strings, trees, and graphs occur as ”natural” representations of structured data in different application areas of machine learning. We develop the theory of structure spaces and derive geometrical and analytical concepts such as the angle between structures and the derivative of functions on structures. In particular, we show that the gradient of a differentiable structural function is a well-deﬁned structure pointing in the direction of steepest ascent. Exploiting the properties of structure spaces, it will turn out that a number of problems in structural pattern recognition such as central clustering or learning in structured output spaces can be formulated as optimization problems with cost functions that are locally Lipschitz. Hence, methods from nonsmooth analysis are applicable to optimize those cost functions.

<p>Author: Brian Kulis, Mátyás A. Sustik, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study low-rank matrix nearness problems, with a focus on learning low-rank positive semideﬁnite (kernel) matrices for machine learning applications. We propose efﬁcient algorithms that scale linearly in the number of data points and quadratically in the rank of the input matrix. Existing algorithms for learning kernel matrices often scale poorly, with running times that are cubic in the number of data points. We employ Bregman matrix divergences as the measures of nearness—these divergences are natural for learning low-rank kernels since they preserve rank as well as positive semideﬁniteness. Special cases of our framework yield faster algorithms for various existing learning problems, and experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms can effectively learn both low-rank and full-rank kernel matrices.

<p>Author: David Newman, Arthur Asuncion, Padhraic Smyth, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: We describe distributed algorithms for two widely-used topic models, namely the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, and the Hierarchical Dirichet Process (HDP) model. In our distributed algorithms the data is partitioned across separate processors and inference is done in a parallel, distributed fashion. We propose two distributed algorithms for LDA. The ﬁrst algorithm is a straightforward mapping of LDA to a distributed processor setting. In this algorithm processors concurrently perform Gibbs sampling over local data followed by a global update of topic counts. The algorithm is simple to implement and can be viewed as an approximation to Gibbs-sampled LDA. The second version is a model that uses a hierarchical Bayesian extension of LDA to directly account for distributed data. This model has a theoretical guarantee of convergence but is more complex to implement than the ﬁrst algorithm. Our distributed algorithm for HDP takes the straightforward mapping approach, and merges newly-created topics either by matching or by topic-id. Using ﬁve real-world text corpora we show that distributed learning works well in practice. For both LDA and HDP, we show that the converged test-data log probability for distributed learning is indistinguishable from that obtained with single-processor learning. Our extensive experimental results include learning topic models for two multi-million document collections using a 1024-processor parallel computer.

<p>Author: Eitan Greenshtein, Junyong Park</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of classiﬁcation using high dimensional features’ space. In a paper by Bickel and Levina (2004), it is recommended to use naive-Bayes classiﬁers, that is, to treat the features as if they are statistically independent. Consider now a sparse setup, where only a few of the features are informative for classiﬁcation. Fan and Fan (2008), suggested a variable selection and classiﬁcation method, called FAIR. The FAIR method improves the design of naive-Bayes classiﬁers in sparse setups. The improvement is due to reducing the noise in estimating the features’ means. This reduction is since that only the means of a few selected variables should be estimated. We also consider the design of naive Bayes classiﬁers. We show that a good alternative to variable selection is estimation of the means through a certain non parametric empirical Bayes procedure. In sparse setups the empirical Bayes implicitly performs an efﬁcient variable selection. It also adapts very well to non sparse setups, and has the advantage of making use of the information from many “weakly informative” variables, which variable selection type of classiﬁcation procedures give up on using. We compare our method with FAIR and other classiﬁcation methods in simulation for sparse and non sparse setups, and in real data examples involving classiﬁcation of normal versus malignant tissues based on microarray data.

<p>Author: Wenxin Jiang</p><p>Abstract: The statistical learning theory of risk minimization depends heavily on probability bounds for uniform deviations of the empirical risks. Classical probability bounds using Hoeffding’s inequality cannot accommodate more general situations with unbounded loss and dependent data. The current paper introduces an inequality that extends Hoeffding’s inequality to handle these more general situations. We will apply this inequality to provide probability bounds for uniform deviations in a very general framework, which can involve discrete decision rules, unbounded loss, and a dependence structure that can be more general than either martingale or strong mixing. We will consider two examples with high dimensional predictors: autoregression (AR) with ℓ1 -loss, and ARX model with variable selection for sign classiﬁcation, which uses both lagged responses and exogenous predictors.

<p>Author: Kilian Q. Weinberger, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: The accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁcation depends signiﬁcantly on the metric used to compute distances between different examples. In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classiﬁcation from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classiﬁcation using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modiﬁcation or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classiﬁcation. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semideﬁnite program. On several data sets of varying size and difﬁculty, we ﬁnd that metrics trained in this way lead to signiﬁcant improvements in kNN classiﬁcation. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.

<p>Author: Marc Boullé</p><p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of computer storage capacities, available data and demand for scoring models both follow an increasing trend, sharper than that of the processing power. However, the main limitation to a wide spread of data mining solutions is the non-increasing availability of skilled data analysts, which play a key role in data preparation and model selection. In this paper, we present a parameter-free scalable classiﬁcation method, which is a step towards fully automatic data mining. The method is based on Bayes optimal univariate conditional density estimators, naive Bayes classiﬁcation enhanced with a Bayesian variable selection scheme, and averaging of models using a logarithmic smoothing of the posterior distribution. We focus on the complexity of the algorithms and show how they can cope with data sets that are far larger than the available central memory. We ﬁnally report results on the Large Scale Learning challenge, where our method obtains state of the art performance within practicable computation time.

<p>Author: Eugene Tuv, Alexander Borisov, George Runger, Kari Torkkola</p><p>Abstract: Predictive models beneﬁt from a compact, non-redundant subset of features that improves interpretability and generalization. Modern data sets are wide, dirty, mixed with both numerical and categorical predictors, and may contain interactive effects that require complex models. This is a challenge for ﬁlters, wrappers, and embedded feature selection methods. We describe details of an algorithm using tree-based ensembles to generate a compact subset of non-redundant features. Parallel and serial ensembles of trees are combined into a mixed method that can uncover masking and detect features of secondary effect. Simulated and actual examples illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

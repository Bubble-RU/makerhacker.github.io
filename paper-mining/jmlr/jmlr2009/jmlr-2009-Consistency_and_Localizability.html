<p>Author: Jonathan Huang, Carlos Guestrin, Leonidas Guibas</p><p>Abstract: Permutations are ubiquitous in many real-world problems, such as voting, ranking, and data association. Representing uncertainty over permutations is challenging, since there are n! possibilities, and typical compact and factorized probability distribution representations, such as graphical models, cannot capture the mutual exclusivity constraints associated with permutations. In this paper, we use the “low-frequency” terms of a Fourier decomposition to represent distributions over permutations compactly. We present Kronecker conditioning, a novel approach for maintaining and updating these distributions directly in the Fourier domain, allowing for polynomial time bandlimited approximations. Low order Fourier-based approximations, however, may lead to functions that do not correspond to valid distributions. To address this problem, we present a quadratic program deﬁned directly in the Fourier domain for projecting the approximation onto a relaxation of the polytope of legal marginal distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real camera-based multi-person tracking scenario.

Vector Versus Matrix Regularizers</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Argyriou, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We consider a general class of regularization methods which learn a vector of parameters on the basis of linear measurements. It is well known that if the regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the L2 norm, then the learned vector is a linear combination of the input data. This result, known as the representer theorem, lies at the basis of kernel-based methods in machine learning. In this paper, we prove the necessity of the above condition, in the case of differentiable regularizers. We further extend our analysis to regularization methods which learn a matrix, a problem which is motivated by the application to multi-task learning. In this context, we study a more general representer theorem, which holds for a larger class of regularizers. We provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition characterizing this class of matrix regularizers and we highlight some concrete examples of practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles from matrix theory, especially the useful notion of matrix nondecreasing functions.

<p>Author: Dao-Hong Xiang, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers binary classiﬁcation algorithms generated from Tikhonov regularization schemes associated with general convex loss functions and varying Gaussian kernels. Our main goal is to provide fast convergence rates for the excess misclassiﬁcation error. Allowing varying Gaussian kernels in the algorithms improves learning rates measured by regularization error and sample error. Special structures of Gaussian kernels enable us to construct, by a nice approximation scheme with a Fourier analysis technique, uniformly bounded regularizing functions achieving polynomial decays of the regularization error under a Sobolev smoothness condition. The sample error is estimated by using a projection operator and a tight bound for the covering numbers of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces generated by Gaussian kernels. The convexity of the general loss function plays a very important role in our analysis.

<p>Author: Han Liu, John Lafferty, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: Recent methods for estimating sparse undirected graphs for real-valued data in high dimensional problems rely heavily on the assumption of normality. We show how to use a semiparametric Gaussian copula—or “nonparanormal”—for high dimensional inference. Just as additive models extend linear models by replacing linear functions with a set of one-dimensional smooth functions, the nonparanormal extends the normal by transforming the variables by smooth functions. We derive a method for estimating the nonparanormal, study the method’s theoretical properties, and show that it works well in many examples.

<p>Author: Hugo Jair Escalante, Manuel Montes, Luis Enrique Sucar</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes the application of particle swarm optimization (PSO) to the problem of full model selection, FMS, for classiﬁcation tasks. FMS is deﬁned as follows: given a pool of preprocessing methods, feature selection and learning algorithms, to select the combination of these that obtains the lowest classiﬁcation error for a given data set; the task also includes the selection of hyperparameters for the considered methods. This problem generates a vast search space to be explored, well suited for stochastic optimization techniques. FMS can be applied to any classiﬁcation domain as it does not require domain knowledge. Different model types and a variety of algorithms can be considered under this formulation. Furthermore, competitive yet simple models can be obtained with FMS. We adopt PSO for the search because of its proven performance in different problems and because of its simplicity, since neither expensive computations nor complicated operations are needed. Interestingly, the way the search is guided allows PSO to avoid overﬁtting to some extend. Experimental results on benchmark data sets give evidence that the proposed approach is very effective, despite its simplicity. Furthermore, results obtained in the framework of a model selection challenge show the competitiveness of the models selected with PSO, compared to models selected with other techniques that focus on a single algorithm and that use domain knowledge.

<p>Author: Alon Zakai, Ya'acov Ritov</p><p>Abstract: We show that all consistent learning methodsĂ˘&euro;&rdquo;that is, that asymptotically achieve the lowest possible expected loss for any distribution on (X,Y )Ă˘&euro;&rdquo;are necessarily localizable, by which we mean that they do not signiÄ?Ĺš cantly change their response at a particular point when we show them only the part of the training set that is close to that point. This is true in particular for methods that appear to be deÄ?Ĺš ned in a non-local manner, such as support vector machines in classiÄ?Ĺš cation and least-squares estimators in regression. Aside from showing that consistency implies a speciÄ?Ĺš c form of localizability, we also show that consistency is logically equivalent to the combination of two properties: (1) a form of localizability, and (2) that the methodĂ˘&euro;&trade;s global mean (over the entire X distribution) correctly estimates the true mean. Consistency can therefore be seen as comprised of two aspects, one local and one global.

<p>Author: Jose M. Peña, Roland Nilsson, Johan Björkegren, Jesper Tegnér</p><p>Abstract: We present a sound and complete graphical criterion for reading dependencies from the minimal undirected independence map G of a graphoid M that satisﬁes weak transitivity. Here, complete means that it is able to read all the dependencies in M that can be derived by applying the graphoid properties and weak transitivity to the dependencies used in the construction of G and the independencies obtained from G by vertex separation. We argue that assuming weak transitivity is not too restrictive. As an intermediate step in the derivation of the graphical criterion, we prove that for any undirected graph G there exists a strictly positive discrete probability distribution with the prescribed sample spaces that is faithful to G. We also report an algorithm that implements the graphical criterion and whose running time is considered to be at most O(n2 (e + n)) for n nodes and e edges. Finally, we illustrate how the graphical criterion can be used within bioinformatics to identify biologically meaningful gene dependencies.

<p>Author: Brijnesh J. Jain, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Finite structures such as point patterns, strings, trees, and graphs occur as ”natural” representations of structured data in different application areas of machine learning. We develop the theory of structure spaces and derive geometrical and analytical concepts such as the angle between structures and the derivative of functions on structures. In particular, we show that the gradient of a differentiable structural function is a well-deﬁned structure pointing in the direction of steepest ascent. Exploiting the properties of structure spaces, it will turn out that a number of problems in structural pattern recognition such as central clustering or learning in structured output spaces can be formulated as optimization problems with cost functions that are locally Lipschitz. Hence, methods from nonsmooth analysis are applicable to optimize those cost functions.

We present algebraic algorithms for computing such integrals exactly for discrete data of small sample size. Our methods apply to both uniform priors and Dirichlet priors.

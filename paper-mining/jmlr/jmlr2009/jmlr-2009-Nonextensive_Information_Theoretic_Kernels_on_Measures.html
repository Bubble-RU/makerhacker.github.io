Some of these kernels are related to classic information theoretic quantities, such as (Shannon’s) mutual information and the JensenShannon (JS) divergence. Meanwhile, there have been recent advances in nonextensive generalizations of Shannon’s information theory. This paper bridges these two trends by introducing nonextensive information theoretic kernels on probability measures, based on new JS-type divergences. These new divergences result from extending the the two building blocks of the classical JS divergence: convexity and Shannon’s entropy. The notion of convexity is extended to the wider concept of q-convexity, for which we prove a Jensen q-inequality. Based on this inequality, we introduce Jensen-Tsallis (JT) q-differences, a nonextensive generalization of the JS divergence, and deﬁne a k-th order JT q-difference between stochastic processes. We then deﬁne a new family of nonextensive mutual information kernels, which allow weights to be assigned to their arguments, and which includes the Boolean, JS, and linear kernels as particular cases. Nonextensive string kernels are also deﬁned that generalize the p-spectrum kernel. We illustrate the performance of these kernels on text categorization tasks, in which documents are modeled both as bags of words and as sequences of characters.

<p>Author: Cynthia Rudin, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: We study boosting algorithms for learning to rank. We give a general margin-based bound for ranking based on covering numbers for the hypothesis space. Our bound suggests that algorithms that maximize the ranking margin will generalize well. We then describe a new algorithm, smooth margin ranking, that precisely converges to a maximum ranking-margin solution. The algorithm is a modiﬁcation of RankBoost, analogous to “approximate coordinate ascent boosting.” Finally, we prove that AdaBoost and RankBoost are equally good for the problems of bipartite ranking and classiﬁcation in terms of their asymptotic behavior on the training set. Under natural conditions, AdaBoost achieves an area under the ROC curve that is equally as good as RankBoost’s; furthermore, RankBoost, when given a speciﬁc intercept, achieves a misclassiﬁcation error that is as good as AdaBoost’s. This may help to explain the empirical observations made by Cortes and Mohri, and Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, about the excellent performance of AdaBoost as a bipartite ranking algorithm, as measured by the area under the ROC curve.

<p>Author: Brian Kulis, Mátyás A. Sustik, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study low-rank matrix nearness problems, with a focus on learning low-rank positive semideﬁnite (kernel) matrices for machine learning applications. We propose efﬁcient algorithms that scale linearly in the number of data points and quadratically in the rank of the input matrix. Existing algorithms for learning kernel matrices often scale poorly, with running times that are cubic in the number of data points. We employ Bregman matrix divergences as the measures of nearness—these divergences are natural for learning low-rank kernels since they preserve rank as well as positive semideﬁniteness. Special cases of our framework yield faster algorithms for various existing learning problems, and experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms can effectively learn both low-rank and full-rank kernel matrices.

<p>Author: Jean Hausser, Korbinian Strimmer</p><p>Abstract: We present a procedure for effective estimation of entropy and mutual information from smallsample data, and apply it to the problem of inferring high-dimensional gene association networks. SpeciÄ?Ĺš cally, we develop a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator, resulting in a procedure that is highly efÄ?Ĺš cient statistically as well as computationally. Despite its simplicity, we show that it outperforms eight other entropy estimation procedures across a diverse range of sampling scenarios and data-generating models, even in cases of severe undersampling. We illustrate the approach by analyzing E. coli gene expression data and computing an entropy-based gene-association network from gene expression data. A computer program is available that implements the proposed shrinkage estimator.

<p>Author: Leonid (Aryeh) Kontorovich, Boaz Nadler</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for supervised learning of discrete concepts. Since the 1970’s, the standard computational primitive has been to ﬁnd the most consistent hypothesis in a given complexity class. In contrast, in this paper we propose a new basic operation: for each pair of input instances, count how many concepts of bounded complexity contain both of them. Our approach maps instances to a Hilbert space, whose metric is induced by a universal kernel coinciding with our computational primitive, and identiﬁes concepts with half-spaces. We prove that all concepts are linearly separable under this mapping. Hence, given a labeled sample and an oracle for evaluating the universal kernel, we can efﬁciently compute a linear classiﬁer (via SVM, for example) and use margin bounds to control its generalization error. Even though exact evaluation of the universal kernel may be infeasible, in various natural situations it is efﬁciently approximable. Though our approach is general, our main application is to regular languages. Our approach presents a substantial departure from current learning paradigms and in particular yields a novel method for learning this fundamental concept class. Unlike existing techniques, we make no structural assumptions on the corresponding unknown automata, the string distribution or the completeness of the training set. Instead, given a labeled sample our algorithm outputs a classiﬁer with guaranteed distribution-free generalization bounds; to our knowledge, the proposed framework is the only one capable of achieving the latter. Along the way, we touch upon several fundamental questions in complexity, automata, and machine learning.

<p>Author: André F. T. Martins, Noah A. Smith, Eric P. Xing, Pedro M. Q. Aguiar, Mário A. T. Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: Positive deﬁnite kernels on probability measures have been recently applied to classiﬁcation problems involving text, images, and other types of structured data. Some of these kernels are related to classic information theoretic quantities, such as (Shannon’s) mutual information and the JensenShannon (JS) divergence. Meanwhile, there have been recent advances in nonextensive generalizations of Shannon’s information theory. This paper bridges these two trends by introducing nonextensive information theoretic kernels on probability measures, based on new JS-type divergences. These new divergences result from extending the the two building blocks of the classical JS divergence: convexity and Shannon’s entropy. The notion of convexity is extended to the wider concept of q-convexity, for which we prove a Jensen q-inequality. Based on this inequality, we introduce Jensen-Tsallis (JT) q-differences, a nonextensive generalization of the JS divergence, and deﬁne a k-th order JT q-difference between stochastic processes. We then deﬁne a new family of nonextensive mutual information kernels, which allow weights to be assigned to their arguments, and which includes the Boolean, JS, and linear kernels as particular cases. Nonextensive string kernels are also deﬁned that generalize the p-spectrum kernel. We illustrate the performance of these kernels on text categorization tasks, in which documents are modeled both as bags of words and as sequences of characters.

<p>Author: Lisa Hellerstein, Bernard Rosell, Eric Bach, Soumya Ray, David Page</p><p>Abstract: A Boolean function f is correlation immune if each input variable is independent of the output, under the uniform distribution on inputs. For example, the parity function is correlation immune. We consider the problem of identifying relevant variables of a correlation immune function, in the presence of irrelevant variables. We address this problem in two different contexts. First, we analyze Skewing, a heuristic method that was developed to improve the ability of greedy decision tree algorithms to identify relevant variables of correlation immune Boolean functions, given examples drawn from the uniform distribution (Page and Ray, 2003). We present theoretical results revealing both the capabilities and limitations of skewing. Second, we explore the problem of identifying relevant variables in the Product Distribution Choice (PDC) learning model, a model in which the learner can choose product distributions and obtain examples from them. We prove a lemma establishing a property of Boolean functions that may be of independent interest. Using this lemma, we give two new algorithms for ﬁnding relevant variables of correlation immune functions in the PDC model.

<p>Author: Holger Höfling, Robert Tibshirani</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problems of estimating the parameters as well as the structure of binary-valued Markov networks. For maximizing the penalized log-likelihood, we implement an approximate procedure based on the pseudo-likelihood of Besag (1975) and generalize it to a fast exact algorithm. The exact algorithm starts with the pseudo-likelihood solution and then adjusts the pseudolikelihood criterion so that each additional iterations moves it closer to the exact solution. Our results show that this procedure is faster than the competing exact method proposed by Lee, Ganapathi, and Koller (2006a). However, we also ﬁnd that the approximate pseudo-likelihood as well as the approaches of Wainwright et al. (2006), when implemented using the coordinate descent procedure of Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2008b), are much faster than the exact methods, and only slightly less accurate.

<p>Author: Junning Li, Z. Jane Wang</p><p>Abstract: In real world applications, graphical statistical models are not only a tool for operations such as classiﬁcation or prediction, but usually the network structures of the models themselves are also of great interest (e.g., in modeling brain connectivity). The false discovery rate (FDR), the expected ratio of falsely claimed connections to all those claimed, is often a reasonable error-rate criterion in these applications. However, current learning algorithms for graphical models have not been adequately adapted to the concerns of the FDR. The traditional practice of controlling the type I error rate and the type II error rate under a conventional level does not necessarily keep the FDR low, especially in the case of sparse networks. In this paper, we propose embedding an FDR-control procedure into the PC algorithm to curb the FDR of the skeleton of the learned graph. We prove that the proposed method can control the FDR under a user-speciﬁed level at the limit of large sample sizes. In the cases of moderate sample size (about several hundred), empirical experiments show that the method is still able to control the FDR under the user-speciﬁed level, and a heuristic modiﬁcation of the method is able to control the FDR more accurately around the user-speciﬁed level. The proposed method is applicable to any models for which statistical tests of conditional independence are available, such as discrete models and Gaussian models.

<p>Author: Cynthia Rudin</p><p>Abstract: We are interested in supervised ranking algorithms that perform especially well near the top of the ranked list, and are only required to perform sufﬁciently well on the rest of the list. In this work, we provide a general form of convex objective that gives high-scoring examples more importance. This “push” near the top of the list can be chosen arbitrarily large or small, based on the preference of the user. We choose ℓ p -norms to provide a speciﬁc type of push; if the user sets p larger, the objective concentrates harder on the top of the list. We derive a generalization bound based on the p-norm objective, working around the natural asymmetry of the problem. We then derive a boosting-style algorithm for the problem of ranking with a push at the top. The usefulness of the algorithm is illustrated through experiments on repository data. We prove that the minimizer of the algorithm’s objective is unique in a speciﬁc sense. Furthermore, we illustrate how our objective is related to quality measurements for information retrieval.

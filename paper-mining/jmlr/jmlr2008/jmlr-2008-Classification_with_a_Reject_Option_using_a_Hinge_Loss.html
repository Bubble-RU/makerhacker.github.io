<h1>21 jmlr-2008-Classification with a Reject Option using a Hinge Loss</h1>

Just as in the conventional classiﬁcation problem, minimization of the sample average of the cost is a difﬁcult optimization problem.

<p>Author: Bernadetta Tarigan, Sara A. van de Geer</p><p>Abstract: The success of support vector machines in binary classiﬁcation relies on the fact that hinge loss employed in the risk minimization targets the Bayes rule. Recent research explores some extensions of this large margin based method to the multicategory case. We show a moment bound for the socalled multi-hinge loss minimizers based on two kinds of complexity constraints: entropy with bracketing and empirical entropy. Obtaining such a result based on the latter is harder than ﬁnding one based on the former. We obtain fast rates of convergence that adapt to the unknown margin.

<p>Author: Imhoi Koo, Rhee Man Kil</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new method of model selection for regression problems using the modulus of continuity. For this purpose, we suggest the prediction risk bounds of regression models using the modulus of continuity which can be interpreted as the complexity of functions. We also present the model selection criterion referred to as the modulus of continuity information criterion (MCIC) which is derived from the suggested prediction risk bounds. The suggested MCIC provides a risk estimate using the modulus of continuity for a trained regression model (or an estimation function) while other model selection criteria such as the AIC and BIC use structural information such as the number of training parameters. As a result, the suggested MCIC is able to discriminate the performances of trained regression models, even with the same structure of training models. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, the simulation for function approximation using the multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) was conducted. Through the simulation for function approximation, it was demonstrated that the suggested MCIC provides a good selection tool for nonlinear regression models, even with the limited size of data.

<p>Author: Andreas Maurer</p><p>Abstract: A method is introduced to learn and represent similarity with linear operators in kernel induced Hilbert spaces. Transferring error bounds for vector valued large-margin classiﬁers to the setting of Hilbert-Schmidt operators leads to dimension free bounds on a risk functional for linear representations and motivates a regularized objective functional. Minimization of this objective is effected by a simple technique of stochastic gradient descent. The resulting representations are tested on transfer problems in image processing, involving plane and spatial geometric invariants, handwritten characters and face recognition.

<p>Author: Andreas Maurer</p><p>Abstract: A method is introduced to learn and represent similarity with linear operators in kernel induced Hilbert spaces. Transferring error bounds for vector valued large-margin classiﬁers to the setting of Hilbert-Schmidt operators leads to dimension free bounds on a risk functional for linear representations and motivates a regularized objective functional. Minimization of this objective is effected by a simple technique of stochastic gradient descent. The resulting representations are tested on transfer problems in image processing, involving plane and spatial geometric invariants, handwritten characters and face recognition.

<p>Author: Sébastien Loustau</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates statistical performances of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and considers the problem of adaptation to the margin parameter and to complexity. In particular we provide a classiﬁer with no tuning parameter. It is a combination of SVM classiﬁers. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we propose learning rates for SVM using Sobolev spaces and build a numerically realizable aggregate that converges with same rate; (2) we present practical experiments of this method of aggregation for SVM using both Sobolev spaces and Gaussian kernels.

<p>Author: Thomas G. Dietterich, Guohua Hao, Adam Ashenfelter</p><p>Abstract: Conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs) provide a ﬂexible and powerful model for sequence labeling problems. However, existing learning algorithms are slow, particularly in problems with large numbers of potential input features and feature combinations. This paper describes a new algorithm for training CRFs via gradient tree boosting. In tree boosting, the CRF potential functions are represented as weighted sums of regression trees, which provide compact representations of feature interactions. So the algorithm does not explicitly consider the potentially large parameter space. As a result, gradient tree boosting scales linearly in the order of the Markov model and in the order of the feature interactions, rather than exponentially as in previous algorithms based on iterative scaling and gradient descent. Gradient tree boosting also makes it possible to use instance weighting (as in C4.5) and surrogate splitting (as in CART) to handle missing values. Experimental studies of the effectiveness of these two methods (as well as standard imputation and indicator feature methods) show that instance weighting is the best method in most cases when feature values are missing at random.

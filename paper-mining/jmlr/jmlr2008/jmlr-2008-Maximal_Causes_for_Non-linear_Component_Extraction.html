<p>Author: Bo Jiang, Xuegong Zhang, Tianxi Cai</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most popular and promising classiﬁcation algorithms. After a classiﬁcation rule is constructed via the SVM, it is essential to evaluate its prediction accuracy. In this paper, we develop procedures for obtaining both point and interval estimators for the prediction error. Under mild regularity conditions, we derive the consistency and asymptotic normality of the prediction error estimators for SVM with ﬁnite-dimensional kernels. A perturbationresampling procedure is proposed to obtain interval estimates for the prediction error in practice. With numerical studies on simulated data and a benchmark repository, we recommend the use of interval estimates centered at the cross-validated point estimates for the prediction error. Further applications of the proposed procedure in model evaluation and feature selection are illustrated with two examples.

<p>Author: Eyal Krupka, Amir Navot, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Feature selection is the task of choosing a small subset of features that is sufﬁcient to predict the target labels well. Here, instead of trying to directly determine which features are better, we attempt to learn the properties of good features. For this purpose we assume that each feature is represented by a set of properties, referred to as meta-features. This approach enables prediction of the quality of features without measuring their value on the training instances. We use this ability to devise new selection algorithms that can efﬁciently search for new good features in the presence of a huge number of features, and to dramatically reduce the number of feature measurements needed. We demonstrate our algorithms on a handwritten digit recognition problem and a visual object category recognition problem. In addition, we show how this novel viewpoint enables derivation of better generalization bounds for the joint learning problem of selection and classiﬁcation, and how it contributes to a better understanding of the problem. Speciﬁcally, in the context of object recognition, previous works showed that it is possible to ﬁnd one set of features which ﬁts most object categories (aka a universal dictionary). Here we use our framework to analyze one such universal dictionary and ﬁnd that the quality of features in this dictionary can be predicted accurately by its meta-features.

<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Zaiqing Nie, Bo Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen</p><p>Abstract: Existing template-independent web data extraction approaches adopt highly ineffective decoupled strategies—attempting to do data record detection and attribute labeling in two separate phases. In this paper, we propose an integrated web data extraction paradigm with hierarchical models. The proposed model is called Dynamic Hierarchical Markov Random Fields (DHMRFs). DHMRFs take structural uncertainty into consideration and deﬁne a joint distribution of both model structure and class labels. The joint distribution is an exponential family distribution. As a conditional model, DHMRFs relax the independence assumption as made in directed models. Since exact inference is intractable, a variational method is developed to learn the model’s parameters and to ﬁnd the MAP model structure and label assignments. We apply DHMRFs to a real-world web data extraction task. Experimental results show that: (1) integrated web data extraction models can achieve signiﬁcant improvements on both record detection and attribute labeling compared to decoupled models; (2) in diverse web data extraction DHMRFs can potentially address the blocky artifact issue which is suffered by ﬁxed-structured hierarchical models.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: The linear model with sparsity-favouring prior on the coefﬁcients has important applications in many different domains. In machine learning, most methods to date search for maximum a posteriori sparse solutions and neglect to represent posterior uncertainties. In this paper, we address problems of Bayesian optimal design (or experiment planning), for which accurate estimates of uncertainty are essential. To this end, we employ expectation propagation approximate inference for the linear model with Laplace prior, giving new insight into numerical stability properties and proposing a robust algorithm. We also show how to estimate model hyperparameters by empirical Bayesian maximisation of the marginal likelihood, and propose ideas in order to scale up the method to very large underdetermined problems. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on the application of gene regulatory network identiﬁcation from micro-array expression data, where both the Laplace prior and the active experimental design approach are shown to result in signiﬁcant improvements. We also address the problem of sparse coding of natural images, and show how our framework can be used for compressive sensing tasks. Part of this work appeared in Seeger et al. (2007b). The gene network identiﬁcation application appears in Steinke et al. (2007).

<p>Author: Kun Zhang, Laiwan Chan</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that solutions to the nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) problem are highly non-unique. In this paper we propose the “minimal nonlinear distortion” (MND) principle for tackling the ill-posedness of nonlinear ICA problems. MND prefers the nonlinear ICA solution with the estimated mixing procedure as close as possible to linear, among all possible solutions. It also helps to avoid local optima in the solutions. To achieve MND, we exploit a regularization term to minimize the mean square error between the nonlinear mixing mapping and the best-ﬁtting linear one. The effect of MND on the inherent trivial and non-trivial indeterminacies in nonlinear ICA solutions is investigated. Moreover, we show that local MND is closely related to the smoothness regularizer penalizing large curvature, which provides another useful regularization condition for nonlinear ICA. Experiments on synthetic data show the usefulness of the MND principle for separating various nonlinear mixtures. Finally, as an application, we use nonlinear ICA with MND to separate daily returns of a set of stocks in Hong Kong, and the linear causal relations among them are successfully discovered. The resulting causal relations give some interesting insights into the stock market. Such a result can not be achieved by linear ICA. Simulation studies also verify that when doing causality discovery, sometimes one should not ignore the nonlinear distortion in the data generation procedure, even if it is weak.

<p>Author: Ilya Shpitser, Judea Pearl</p><p>Abstract: We consider a hierarchy of queries about causal relationships in graphical models, where each level in the hierarchy requires more detailed information than the one below. The hierarchy consists of three levels: associative relationships, derived from a joint distribution over the observable variables; cause-effect relationships, derived from distributions resulting from external interventions; and counterfactuals, derived from distributions that span multiple “parallel worlds” and resulting from simultaneous, possibly conﬂicting observations and interventions. We completely characterize cases where a given causal query can be computed from information lower in the hierarchy, and provide algorithms that accomplish this computation. Speciﬁcally, we show when effects of interventions can be computed from observational studies, and when probabilities of counterfactuals can be computed from experimental studies. We also provide a graphical characterization of those queries which cannot be computed (by any method) from queries at a lower layer of the hierarchy.

<p>Author: Faustino Gomez, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Risto Miikkulainen</p><p>Abstract: Many complex control problems require sophisticated solutions that are not amenable to traditional controller design. Not only is it difﬁcult to model real world systems, but often it is unclear what kind of behavior is required to solve the task. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have made progress by using direct interaction with the task environment, but have so far not scaled well to large state spaces and environments that are not fully observable. In recent years, neuroevolution, the artiﬁcial evolution of neural networks, has had remarkable success in tasks that exhibit these two properties. In this paper, we compare a neuroevolution method called Cooperative Synapse Neuroevolution (CoSyNE), that uses cooperative coevolution at the level of individual synaptic weights, to a broad range of reinforcement learning algorithms on very difﬁcult versions of the pole balancing problem that involve large (continuous) state spaces and hidden state. CoSyNE is shown to be signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient and powerful than the other methods on these tasks.

<p>Author: Jörg Lücke,  Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: We study a generative model in which hidden causes combine competitively to produce observations. Multiple active causes combine to determine the value of an observed variable through a max function, in the place where algorithms such as sparse coding, independent component analysis, or non-negative matrix factorization would use a sum. This max rule can represent a more realistic model of non-linear interaction between basic components in many settings, including acoustic and image data. While exact maximum-likelihood learning of the parameters of this model proves to be intractable, we show that efﬁcient approximations to expectation-maximization (EM) can be found in the case of sparsely active hidden causes. One of these approximations can be formulated as a neural network model with a generalized softmax activation function and Hebbian learning. Thus, we show that learning in recent softmax-like neural networks may be interpreted as approximate maximization of a data likelihood. We use the bars benchmark test to numerically verify our analytical results and to demonstrate the competitiveness of the resulting algorithms. Finally, we show results of learning model parameters to ﬁt acoustic and visual data sets in which max-like component combinations arise naturally.

<p>Author: Arnak S. Dalalyan, Anatoly Juditsky, Vladimir Spokoiny</p><p>Abstract: The statistical problem of estimating the effective dimension-reduction (EDR) subspace in the multi-index regression model with deterministic design and additive noise is considered. A new procedure for recovering the directions of the EDR subspace is proposed. Many methods for estimating the EDR subspace perform principal component analysis on a family of vectors, say ˆ ˆ β1 , . . . , βL , nearly lying in the EDR subspace. This is in particular the case for the structure-adaptive approach proposed by Hristache et al. (2001a). In the present work, we propose to estimate the projector onto the EDR subspace by the solution to the optimization problem minimize ˆ ˆ max β (I − A)β =1,...,L subject to A ∈ Am∗ , where Am∗ is the set of all symmetric matrices with eigenvalues in [0, 1] and trace less than or equal √ to m∗ , with m∗ being the true structural dimension. Under mild assumptions, n-consistency of the proposed procedure is proved (up to a logarithmic factor) in the case when the structural dimension is not larger than 4. Moreover, the stochastic error of the estimator of the projector onto the EDR subspace is shown to depend on L logarithmically. This enables us to use a large number of vectors ˆ β for estimating the EDR subspace. The empirical behavior of the algorithm is studied through numerical simulations.

<p>Author: Ilya Shpitser, Judea Pearl</p><p>Abstract: We consider a hierarchy of queries about causal relationships in graphical models, where each level in the hierarchy requires more detailed information than the one below. The hierarchy consists of three levels: associative relationships, derived from a joint distribution over the observable variables; cause-effect relationships, derived from distributions resulting from external interventions; and counterfactuals, derived from distributions that span multiple “parallel worlds” and resulting from simultaneous, possibly conﬂicting observations and interventions. We completely characterize cases where a given causal query can be computed from information lower in the hierarchy, and provide algorithms that accomplish this computation. Speciﬁcally, we show when effects of interventions can be computed from observational studies, and when probabilities of counterfactuals can be computed from experimental studies. We also provide a graphical characterization of those queries which cannot be computed (by any method) from queries at a lower layer of the hierarchy.

<p>Author: Manu Chhabra, Robert A. Jacobs</p><p>Abstract: The computational complexities arising in motor control can be ameliorated through the use of a library of motor synergies. We present a new model, referred to as the Greedy Additive Regression (GAR) model, for learning a library of torque sequences, and for learning the coefﬁcients of a linear combination of sequences minimizing a cost function. From the perspective of numerical optimization, the GAR model is interesting because it creates a library of “local features”—each sequence in the library is a solution to a single training task—and learns to combine these sequences using a local optimization procedure, namely, additive regression. We speculate that learners with local representational primitives and local optimization procedures will show good performance on nonlinear tasks. The GAR model is also interesting from the perspective of motor control because it outperforms several competing models. Results using a simulated two-joint arm suggest that the GAR model consistently shows excellent performance in the sense that it rapidly learns to perform novel, complex motor tasks. Moreover, its library is overcomplete and sparse, meaning that only a small fraction of the stored torque sequences are used when learning a new movement. The library is also robust in the sense that, after an initial training period, nearly all novel movements can be learned as additive combinations of sequences in the library, and in the sense that it shows good generalization when an arm’s dynamics are altered between training and test conditions, such as when a payload is added to the arm. Lastly, the GAR model works well regardless of whether motor tasks are speciﬁed in joint space or Cartesian space. We conclude that learning techniques using local primitives and optimization procedures are viable and potentially important methods for motor control and possibly other domains, and that these techniques deserve further examination by the artiﬁcial intelligence and cognitive science</p><p>6 0.43328583 <a title="59-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2008-Search_for_Additive_Nonlinear_Time_Series_Causal_Models.html">84 jmlr-2008-Search for Additive Nonlinear Time Series Causal Models</a></p>

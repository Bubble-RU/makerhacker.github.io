<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Hsuan-Tien Lin, Ling Li</p><p>Abstract: Ensemble learning algorithms such as boosting can achieve better performance by averaging over the predictions of some base hypotheses. Nevertheless, most existing algorithms are limited to combining only a ﬁnite number of hypotheses, and the generated ensemble is usually sparse. Thus, it is not clear whether we should construct an ensemble classiﬁer with a larger or even an inﬁnite number of hypotheses. In addition, constructing an inﬁnite ensemble itself is a challenging task. In this paper, we formulate an inﬁnite ensemble learning framework based on the support vector machine (SVM). The framework can output an inﬁnite and nonsparse ensemble through embedding inﬁnitely many hypotheses into an SVM kernel. We use the framework to derive two novel kernels, the stump kernel and the perceptron kernel. The stump kernel embodies inﬁnitely many decision stumps, and the perceptron kernel embodies inﬁnitely many perceptrons. We also show that the Laplacian radial basis function kernel embodies inﬁnitely many decision trees, and can thus be explained through inﬁnite ensemble learning. Experimental results show that SVM with these kernels is superior to boosting with the same base hypothesis set. In addition, SVM with the stump kernel or the perceptron kernel performs similarly to SVM with the Gaussian radial basis function kernel, but enjoys the beneﬁt of faster parameter selection. These properties make the novel kernels favorable choices in practice.

<p>Author: Jieping Ye, Shuiwang Ji, Jianhui Chen</p><p>Abstract: Regularized kernel discriminant analysis (RKDA) performs linear discriminant analysis in the feature space via the kernel trick. Its performance depends on the selection of kernels. In this paper, we consider the problem of multiple kernel learning (MKL) for RKDA, in which the optimal kernel matrix is obtained as a linear combination of pre-speciﬁed kernel matrices. We show that the kernel learning problem in RKDA can be formulated as convex programs. First, we show that this problem can be formulated as a semideﬁnite program (SDP). Based on the equivalence relationship between RKDA and least square problems in the binary-class case, we propose a convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) formulation for kernel learning in RKDA. A semi-inﬁnite linear programming (SILP) formulation is derived to further improve the efﬁciency. We extend these formulations to the multi-class case based on a key result established in this paper. That is, the multi-class RKDA kernel learning problem can be decomposed into a set of binary-class kernel learning problems which are constrained to share a common kernel. Based on this decomposition property, SDP formulations are proposed for the multi-class case. Furthermore, it leads naturally to QCQP and SILP formulations. As the performance of RKDA depends on the regularization parameter, we show that this parameter can also be optimized in a joint framework with the kernel. Extensive experiments have been conducted and analyzed, and connections to other algorithms are discussed.

Our analysis uses basic principles of functional analysis and especially the useful notion of vector measures which we describe in sufﬁcient detail to clarify our results.

<p>Author: Sébastien Loustau</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates statistical performances of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and considers the problem of adaptation to the margin parameter and to complexity. In particular we provide a classiﬁer with no tuning parameter. It is a combination of SVM classiﬁers. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we propose learning rates for SVM using Sobolev spaces and build a numerically realizable aggregate that converges with same rate; (2) we present practical experiments of this method of aggregation for SVM using both Sobolev spaces and Gaussian kernels.

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Vojtěch Franc, Bogdan Savchynskyy</p><p>Abstract: The max-sum classiﬁer predicts n-tuple of labels from n-tuple of observable variables by maximizing a sum of quality functions deﬁned over neighbouring pairs of labels and observable variables. Predicting labels as MAP assignments of a Random Markov Field is a particular example of the max-sum classiﬁer. Learning parameters of the max-sum classiﬁer is a challenging problem because even computing the response of such classiﬁer is NP-complete in general. Estimating parameters using the Maximum Likelihood approach is feasible only for a subclass of max-sum classiﬁers with an acyclic structure of neighbouring pairs. Recently, the discriminative methods represented by the perceptron and the Support Vector Machines, originally designed for binary linear classiﬁers, have been extended for learning some subclasses of the max-sum classiﬁer. Besides the max-sum classiﬁers with the acyclic neighbouring structure, it has been shown that the discriminative learning is possible even with arbitrary neighbouring structure provided the quality functions fulﬁll some additional constraints. In this article, we extend the discriminative approach to other three classes of max-sum classiﬁers with an arbitrary neighbourhood structure. We derive learning algorithms for two subclasses of max-sum classiﬁers whose response can be computed in polynomial time: (i) the max-sum classiﬁers with supermodular quality functions and (ii) the max-sum classiﬁers whose response can be computed exactly by a linear programming relaxation. Moreover, we show that the learning problem can be approximately solved even for a general max-sum classiﬁer.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We propose a highly efﬁcient framework for penalized likelihood kernel methods applied to multiclass models with a large, structured set of classes. As opposed to many previous approaches which try to decompose the ﬁtting problem into many smaller ones, we focus on a Newton optimization of the complete model, making use of model structure and linear conjugate gradients in order to approximate Newton search directions. Crucially, our learning method is based entirely on matrix-vector multiplication primitives with the kernel matrices and their derivatives, allowing straightforward specialization to new kernels, and focusing code optimization efforts to these primitives only. Kernel parameters are learned automatically, by maximizing the cross-validation log likelihood in a gradient-based way, and predictive probabilities are estimated. We demonstrate our approach on large scale text classiﬁcation tasks with hierarchical structure on thousands of classes, achieving state-of-the-art results in an order of magnitude less time than previous work.

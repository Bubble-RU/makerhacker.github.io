<p>Author: Laurens van der Maaten, Geoffrey Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We present a new technique called “t-SNE” that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces signiﬁcantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to inﬂuence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are signiﬁcantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.

<p>Author: Arthur D. Szlam, Mauro Maggioni, Ronald R. Coifman</p><p>Abstract: Harmonic analysis and diffusion on discrete data has been shown to lead to state-of-the-art algorithms for machine learning tasks, especially in the context of semi-supervised and transductive learning. The success of these algorithms rests on the assumption that the function(s) to be studied (learned, interpolated, etc.) are smooth with respect to the geometry of the data. In this paper we present a method for modifying the given geometry so the function(s) to be studied are smoother with respect to the modiﬁed geometry, and thus more amenable to treatment using harmonic analysis methods. Among the many possible applications, we consider the problems of image denoising and transductive classiﬁcation. In both settings, our approach improves on standard diffusion based methods.

<p>Author: Arnak S. Dalalyan, Anatoly Juditsky, Vladimir Spokoiny</p><p>Abstract: The statistical problem of estimating the effective dimension-reduction (EDR) subspace in the multi-index regression model with deterministic design and additive noise is considered. A new procedure for recovering the directions of the EDR subspace is proposed. Many methods for estimating the EDR subspace perform principal component analysis on a family of vectors, say ˆ ˆ β1 , . . . , βL , nearly lying in the EDR subspace. This is in particular the case for the structure-adaptive approach proposed by Hristache et al. (2001a). In the present work, we propose to estimate the projector onto the EDR subspace by the solution to the optimization problem minimize ˆ ˆ max β (I − A)β =1,...,L subject to A ∈ Am∗ , where Am∗ is the set of all symmetric matrices with eigenvalues in [0, 1] and trace less than or equal √ to m∗ , with m∗ being the true structural dimension. Under mild assumptions, n-consistency of the proposed procedure is proved (up to a logarithmic factor) in the case when the structural dimension is not larger than 4. Moreover, the stochastic error of the estimator of the projector onto the EDR subspace is shown to depend on L logarithmically. This enables us to use a large number of vectors ˆ β for estimating the EDR subspace. The empirical behavior of the algorithm is studied through numerical simulations.

<p>Author: Konrad Rieck, Pavel Laskov</p><p>Abstract: Efﬁcient and expressive comparison of sequences is an essential procedure for learning with sequential data. In this article we propose a generic framework for computation of similarity measures for sequences, covering various kernel, distance and non-metric similarity functions. The basis for comparison is embedding of sequences using a formal language, such as a set of natural words, k-grams or all contiguous subsequences. As realizations of the framework we provide linear-time algorithms of different complexity and capabilities using sorted arrays, tries and sufﬁx trees as underlying data structures. Experiments on data sets from bioinformatics, text processing and computer security illustrate the efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms—enabling peak performances of up to 106 pairwise comparisons per second. The utility of distances and non-metric similarity measures for sequences as alternatives to string kernels is demonstrated in applications of text categorization, network intrusion detection and transcription site recognition in DNA.

<p>Author: Yair Goldberg, Alon Zakai, Dan Kushnir, Ya'acov Ritov</p><p>Abstract: We analyze the performance of a class of manifold-learning algorithms that ﬁnd their output by minimizing a quadratic form under some normalization constraints. This class consists of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Laplacian Eigenmap, Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA), Hessian Eigenmaps (HLLE), and Diffusion maps. We present and prove conditions on the manifold that are necessary for the success of the algorithms. Both the ﬁnite sample case and the limit case are analyzed. We show that there are simple manifolds in which the necessary conditions are violated, and hence the algorithms cannot recover the underlying manifolds. Finally, we present numerical results that demonstrate our claims.

<p>Author: Ilya Shpitser, Judea Pearl</p><p>Abstract: We consider a hierarchy of queries about causal relationships in graphical models, where each level in the hierarchy requires more detailed information than the one below. The hierarchy consists of three levels: associative relationships, derived from a joint distribution over the observable variables; cause-effect relationships, derived from distributions resulting from external interventions; and counterfactuals, derived from distributions that span multiple “parallel worlds” and resulting from simultaneous, possibly conﬂicting observations and interventions. We completely characterize cases where a given causal query can be computed from information lower in the hierarchy, and provide algorithms that accomplish this computation. Speciﬁcally, we show when effects of interventions can be computed from observational studies, and when probabilities of counterfactuals can be computed from experimental studies. We also provide a graphical characterization of those queries which cannot be computed (by any method) from queries at a lower layer of the hierarchy.

<p>Author: Arnak S. Dalalyan, Anatoly Juditsky, Vladimir Spokoiny</p><p>Abstract: The statistical problem of estimating the effective dimension-reduction (EDR) subspace in the multi-index regression model with deterministic design and additive noise is considered. A new procedure for recovering the directions of the EDR subspace is proposed. Many methods for estimating the EDR subspace perform principal component analysis on a family of vectors, say ˆ ˆ β1 , . . . , βL , nearly lying in the EDR subspace. This is in particular the case for the structure-adaptive approach proposed by Hristache et al. (2001a). In the present work, we propose to estimate the projector onto the EDR subspace by the solution to the optimization problem minimize ˆ ˆ max β (I − A)β =1,...,L subject to A ∈ Am∗ , where Am∗ is the set of all symmetric matrices with eigenvalues in [0, 1] and trace less than or equal √ to m∗ , with m∗ being the true structural dimension. Under mild assumptions, n-consistency of the proposed procedure is proved (up to a logarithmic factor) in the case when the structural dimension is not larger than 4. Moreover, the stochastic error of the estimator of the projector onto the EDR subspace is shown to depend on L logarithmically. This enables us to use a large number of vectors ˆ β for estimating the EDR subspace. The empirical behavior of the algorithm is studied through numerical simulations.

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: We consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a block 1 -norm, that is, a sum of Euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger than one. This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual regularization by the 1 -norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic group selection consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model misspeciﬁcation. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the consistency results to this inﬁnite dimensional case and also propose an adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisﬁed.

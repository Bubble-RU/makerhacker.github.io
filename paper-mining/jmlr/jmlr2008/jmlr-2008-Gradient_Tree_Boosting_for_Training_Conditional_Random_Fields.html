<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Geremy Heitz, Gal Elidan, Pieter Abbeel, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning classiﬁers in structured domains, where some objects have a subset of features that are inherently absent due to complex relationships between the features. Unlike the case where a feature exists but its value is not observed, here we focus on the case where a feature may not even exist (structurally absent) for some of the samples. The common approach for handling missing features in discriminative models is to ﬁrst complete their unknown values, and then use a standard classiﬁcation procedure over the completed data. This paper focuses on features that are known to be non-existing, rather than have an unknown value. We show how incomplete data can be classiﬁed directly without any completion of the missing features using a max-margin learning framework. We formulate an objective function, based on the geometric interpretation of the margin, that aims to maximize the margin of each sample in its own relevant subspace. In this formulation, the linearly separable case can be transformed into a binary search over a series of second order cone programs (SOCP), a convex problem that can be solved efﬁciently. We also describe two approaches for optimizing the general case: an approximation that can be solved as a standard quadratic program (QP) and an iterative approach for solving the exact problem. By avoiding the pre-processing phase in which the data is completed, both of these approaches could offer considerable computational savings. More importantly, we show that the elegant handling of missing values by our approach allows it to both outperform other methods when the missing values have non-trivial structure, and be competitive with other methods when the values are missing at random. We demonstrate our results on several standard benchmarks and two real-world problems: edge prediction in metabolic pathways, and automobile detection in natural images.

<p>Author: Vojtěch Franc, Bogdan Savchynskyy</p><p>Abstract: The max-sum classiﬁer predicts n-tuple of labels from n-tuple of observable variables by maximizing a sum of quality functions deﬁned over neighbouring pairs of labels and observable variables. Predicting labels as MAP assignments of a Random Markov Field is a particular example of the max-sum classiﬁer. Learning parameters of the max-sum classiﬁer is a challenging problem because even computing the response of such classiﬁer is NP-complete in general. Estimating parameters using the Maximum Likelihood approach is feasible only for a subclass of max-sum classiﬁers with an acyclic structure of neighbouring pairs. Recently, the discriminative methods represented by the perceptron and the Support Vector Machines, originally designed for binary linear classiﬁers, have been extended for learning some subclasses of the max-sum classiﬁer. Besides the max-sum classiﬁers with the acyclic neighbouring structure, it has been shown that the discriminative learning is possible even with arbitrary neighbouring structure provided the quality functions fulﬁll some additional constraints. In this article, we extend the discriminative approach to other three classes of max-sum classiﬁers with an arbitrary neighbourhood structure. We derive learning algorithms for two subclasses of max-sum classiﬁers whose response can be computed in polynomial time: (i) the max-sum classiﬁers with supermodular quality functions and (ii) the max-sum classiﬁers whose response can be computed exactly by a linear programming relaxation. Moreover, we show that the learning problem can be approximately solved even for a general max-sum classiﬁer.

<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Zaiqing Nie, Bo Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen</p><p>Abstract: Existing template-independent web data extraction approaches adopt highly ineffective decoupled strategies—attempting to do data record detection and attribute labeling in two separate phases. In this paper, we propose an integrated web data extraction paradigm with hierarchical models. The proposed model is called Dynamic Hierarchical Markov Random Fields (DHMRFs). DHMRFs take structural uncertainty into consideration and deﬁne a joint distribution of both model structure and class labels. The joint distribution is an exponential family distribution. As a conditional model, DHMRFs relax the independence assumption as made in directed models. Since exact inference is intractable, a variational method is developed to learn the model’s parameters and to ﬁnd the MAP model structure and label assignments. We apply DHMRFs to a real-world web data extraction task. Experimental results show that: (1) integrated web data extraction models can achieve signiﬁcant improvements on both record detection and attribute labeling compared to decoupled models; (2) in diverse web data extraction DHMRFs can potentially address the blocky artifact issue which is suffered by ﬁxed-structured hierarchical models.

<p>Author: Michael Collins, Amir Globerson, Terry Koo, Xavier Carreras, Peter L. Bartlett</p><p>Abstract: Log-linear and maximum-margin models are two commonly-used methods in supervised machine learning, and are frequently used in structured prediction problems. Efﬁcient learning of parameters in these models is therefore an important problem, and becomes a key factor when learning from very large data sets. This paper describes exponentiated gradient (EG) algorithms for training such models, where EG updates are applied to the convex dual of either the log-linear or maxmargin objective function; the dual in both the log-linear and max-margin cases corresponds to minimizing a convex function with simplex constraints. We study both batch and online variants of the algorithm, and provide rates of convergence for both cases. In the max-margin case, O( 1 ) EG ε updates are required to reach a given accuracy ε in the dual; in contrast, for log-linear models only O(log( 1 )) updates are required. For both the max-margin and log-linear cases, our bounds suggest ε that the online EG algorithm requires a factor of n less computation to reach a desired accuracy than the batch EG algorithm, where n is the number of training examples. Our experiments conﬁrm that the online algorithms are much faster than the batch algorithms in practice. We describe how the EG updates factor in a convenient way for structured prediction problems, allowing the algorithms to be efﬁciently applied to problems such as sequence learning or natural language parsing. We perform extensive evaluation of the algorithms, comparing them to L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent for log-linear models, and to SVM-Struct for max-margin models. The algorithms are applied to a multi-class problem as well as to a more complex large-scale parsing task. In all these settings, the EG algorithms presented here outperform the other methods.

<p>Author: Yonatan Amit, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe and analyze an algorithmic framework for online classiﬁcation where each online trial consists of multiple prediction tasks that are tied together. We tackle the problem of updating the online predictor by deﬁning a projection problem in which each prediction task corresponds to a single linear constraint. These constraints are tied together through a single slack parameter. We then introduce a general method for approximately solving the problem by projecting simultaneously and independently on each constraint which corresponds to a prediction sub-problem, and then averaging the individual solutions. We show that this approach constitutes a feasible, albeit not necessarily optimal, solution of the original projection problem. We derive concrete simultaneous projection schemes and analyze them in the mistake bound model. We demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithm in experiments with synthetic data and with multiclass text categorization tasks.

<p>Author: Andreas Maurer</p><p>Abstract: A method is introduced to learn and represent similarity with linear operators in kernel induced Hilbert spaces. Transferring error bounds for vector valued large-margin classiﬁers to the setting of Hilbert-Schmidt operators leads to dimension free bounds on a risk functional for linear representations and motivates a regularized objective functional. Minimization of this objective is effected by a simple technique of stochastic gradient descent. The resulting representations are tested on transfer problems in image processing, involving plane and spatial geometric invariants, handwritten characters and face recognition.

<p>Author: Thomas G. Dietterich, Guohua Hao, Adam Ashenfelter</p><p>Abstract: Conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs) provide a ﬂexible and powerful model for sequence labeling problems. However, existing learning algorithms are slow, particularly in problems with large numbers of potential input features and feature combinations. This paper describes a new algorithm for training CRFs via gradient tree boosting. In tree boosting, the CRF potential functions are represented as weighted sums of regression trees, which provide compact representations of feature interactions. So the algorithm does not explicitly consider the potentially large parameter space. As a result, gradient tree boosting scales linearly in the order of the Markov model and in the order of the feature interactions, rather than exponentially as in previous algorithms based on iterative scaling and gradient descent. Gradient tree boosting also makes it possible to use instance weighting (as in C4.5) and surrogate splitting (as in CART) to handle missing values. Experimental studies of the effectiveness of these two methods (as well as standard imputation and indicator feature methods) show that instance weighting is the best method in most cases when feature values are missing at random.

<p>Author: Bernadetta Tarigan, Sara A. van de Geer</p><p>Abstract: The success of support vector machines in binary classiﬁcation relies on the fact that hinge loss employed in the risk minimization targets the Bayes rule. Recent research explores some extensions of this large margin based method to the multicategory case. We show a moment bound for the socalled multi-hinge loss minimizers based on two kinds of complexity constraints: entropy with bracketing and empirical entropy. Obtaining such a result based on the latter is harder than ﬁnding one based on the former. We obtain fast rates of convergence that adapt to the unknown margin.

<p>Author: Zach Jorgensen, Yan Zhou, Meador Inge</p><p>Abstract: Statistical spam ﬁlters are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. One of the more common adversarial attacks, known as the good word attack, thwarts spam ﬁlters by appending to spam messages sets of “good” words, which are words that are common in legitimate email but rare in spam. We present a counterattack strategy that attempts to differentiate spam from legitimate email in the input space by transforming each email into a bag of multiple segments, and subsequently applying multiple instance logistic regression on the bags. We treat each segment in the bag as an instance. An email is classiﬁed as spam if at least one instance in the corresponding bag is spam, and as legitimate if all the instances in it are legitimate. We show that a classiﬁer using our multiple instance counterattack strategy is more robust to good word attacks than its single instance counterpart and other single instance learners commonly used in the spam ﬁltering domain.

<p>Author: Andrea Caponnetto, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil, Yiming Ying</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces HK of functions from an input space into a Hilbert space Y , an environment appropriate for multi-task learning. The reproducing kernel K associated to HK has its values as operators on Y . Our primary goal here is to derive conditions which ensure that the kernel K is universal. This means that on every compact subset of the input space, every continuous function with values in Y can be uniformly approximated by sections of the kernel. We provide various characterizations of universal kernels and highlight them with several concrete examples of some practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles of functional analysis and especially the useful notion of vector measures which we describe in sufﬁcient detail to clarify our results.

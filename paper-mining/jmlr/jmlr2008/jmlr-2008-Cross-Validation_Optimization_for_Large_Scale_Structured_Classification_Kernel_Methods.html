<p>Author: Chih-Jen Lin, Ruby C. Weng, S. Sathiya Keerthi</p><p>Abstract: Large-scale logistic regression arises in many applications such as document classiﬁcation and natural language processing. In this paper, we apply a trust region Newton method to maximize the log-likelihood of the logistic regression model. The proposed method uses only approximate Newton steps in the beginning, but achieves fast convergence in the end. Experiments show that it is faster than the commonly used quasi Newton approach for logistic regression. We also extend the proposed method to large-scale L2-loss linear support vector machines (SVM).

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: The linear model with sparsity-favouring prior on the coefﬁcients has important applications in many different domains. In machine learning, most methods to date search for maximum a posteriori sparse solutions and neglect to represent posterior uncertainties. In this paper, we address problems of Bayesian optimal design (or experiment planning), for which accurate estimates of uncertainty are essential. To this end, we employ expectation propagation approximate inference for the linear model with Laplace prior, giving new insight into numerical stability properties and proposing a robust algorithm. We also show how to estimate model hyperparameters by empirical Bayesian maximisation of the marginal likelihood, and propose ideas in order to scale up the method to very large underdetermined problems. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on the application of gene regulatory network identiﬁcation from micro-array expression data, where both the Laplace prior and the active experimental design approach are shown to result in signiﬁcant improvements. We also address the problem of sparse coding of natural images, and show how our framework can be used for compressive sensing tasks. Part of this work appeared in Seeger et al. (2007b). The gene network identiﬁcation application appears in Steinke et al. (2007).

<p>Author: Andrea Caponnetto, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil, Yiming Ying</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces HK of functions from an input space into a Hilbert space Y , an environment appropriate for multi-task learning. The reproducing kernel K associated to HK has its values as operators on Y . Our primary goal here is to derive conditions which ensure that the kernel K is universal. This means that on every compact subset of the input space, every continuous function with values in Y can be uniformly approximated by sections of the kernel. We provide various characterizations of universal kernels and highlight them with several concrete examples of some practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles of functional analysis and especially the useful notion of vector measures which we describe in sufﬁcient detail to clarify our results.

<p>Author: Olivier Chapelle, Vikas Sindhwani, Sathiya S. Keerthi</p><p>Abstract: Due to its wide applicability, the problem of semi-supervised classiﬁcation is attracting increasing attention in machine learning. Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (S 3 VMs) are based on applying the margin maximization principle to both labeled and unlabeled examples. Unlike SVMs, their formulation leads to a non-convex optimization problem. A suite of algorithms have recently been proposed for solving S3 VMs. This paper reviews key ideas in this literature. The performance and behavior of various S3 VM algorithms is studied together, under a common experimental setting.

<p>Author: Jean-Philippe Pellet, André Elisseeff</p><p>Abstract: We show how a generic feature-selection algorithm returning strongly relevant variables can be turned into a causal structure-learning algorithm. We prove this under the Faithfulness assumption for the data distribution. In a causal graph, the strongly relevant variables for a node X are its parents, children, and children’s parents (or spouses), also known as the Markov blanket of X. Identifying the spouses leads to the detection of the V-structure patterns and thus to causal orientations. Repeating the task for all variables yields a valid partially oriented causal graph. We ﬁrst show an efﬁcient way to identify the spouse links. We then perform several experiments in the continuous domain using the Recursive Feature Elimination feature-selection algorithm with Support Vector Regression and empirically verify the intuition of this direct (but computationally expensive) approach. Within the same framework, we then devise a fast and consistent algorithm, Total Conditioning (TC), and a variant, TCbw , with an explicit backward feature-selection heuristics, for Gaussian data. After running a series of comparative experiments on ﬁve artiﬁcial networks, we argue that Markov blanket algorithms such as TC/TCbw or Grow-Shrink scale better than the reference PC algorithm and provides higher structural accuracy.

<p>Author: Chih-Jen Lin, Ruby C. Weng, S. Sathiya Keerthi</p><p>Abstract: Large-scale logistic regression arises in many applications such as document classiﬁcation and natural language processing. In this paper, we apply a trust region Newton method to maximize the log-likelihood of the logistic regression model. The proposed method uses only approximate Newton steps in the beginning, but achieves fast convergence in the end. Experiments show that it is faster than the commonly used quasi Newton approach for logistic regression. We also extend the proposed method to large-scale L2-loss linear support vector machines (SVM).

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Kai-Wei Chang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Linear support vector machines (SVM) are useful for classifying large-scale sparse data. Problems with sparse features are common in applications such as document classiﬁcation and natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a novel coordinate descent algorithm for training linear SVM with the L2-loss function. At each step, the proposed method minimizes a one-variable sub-problem while ﬁxing other variables. The sub-problem is solved by Newton steps with the line search technique. The procedure globally converges at the linear rate. As each sub-problem involves only values of a corresponding feature, the proposed approach is suitable when accessing a feature is more convenient than accessing an instance. Experiments show that our method is more efﬁcient and stable than state of the art methods such as Pegasos and TRON.

<h1>67 jmlr-2008-Near-Optimal Sensor Placements in Gaussian Processes: Theory, Efficient Algorithms and Empirical Studies</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2008-67-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume9/krause08a/krause08a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Andreas Krause, Ajit Singh, Carlos Guestrin</p><p>Abstract: When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of ﬁnding the conﬁguration that maximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding signiﬁcant speedups. We also extend our approach to ﬁnd placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodularity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.

[sent-7, score-0.666]
</p><p>2 In other settings, a location may be “too far” from existing sensors to enable good prediction if we only consider one of them, but combining data from multiple sensors we can obtain accurate predictions. [sent-26, score-0.778]
</p><p>3 1 Given a GP model, many criteria have been proposed for characterizing the quality of placements, including placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design, and mutual information (cf. [sent-31, score-0.835]
</p><p>4 A typical sensor placement technique is to greedily add sensors where uncertainty about the phenomena is highest, that is, the highest entropy location of the GP (Cressie, 1991; Shewry and Wynn, 1987). [sent-33, score-1.207]
</p><p>5 The highest entropy set, that is, the sensors that are most uncertain about each other’s measurements, is usually characterized by sensor locations that are as far as possible from each other. [sent-35, score-1.077]
</p><p>6 Since a sensor usually provides information about the area around it, a sensor on the boundary “wastes” sensed information. [sent-38, score-0.944]
</p><p>7 An alternative criterion, proposed by Caselton and Zidek (1984), mutual information, seeks to ﬁnd sensor placements that are most informative about unsensed locations. [sent-39, score-1.059]
</p><p>8 This optimization criterion directly measures the effect of sensor placements on the posterior uncertainty of the GP. [sent-40, score-0.886]
</p><p>9 , 1978), we design the ﬁrst approximation algorithm that guarantees a constant-factor approximation of the best set of sensor locations in polynomial time. [sent-45, score-0.738]
</p><p>10 To the best of our knowledge, no such guarantee exists for any other GP-based sensor placement approach, and for any other criterion. [sent-46, score-0.68]
</p><p>11 This initial GP is, of course, a rough model, and a sensor placement strategy can be viewed as an inner-loop step for an active learning algorithm (MacKay, 2003). [sent-48, score-0.677]
</p><p>12 We address this problem in two ways: First, we develop a lazy evaluation technique that exploits submodularity to reduce signiﬁcantly the number of sensor locations that need to be checked, thus speeding up computation. [sent-53, score-0.755]
</p><p>13 We provide a very extensive experimental evaluation, showing that data-driven placements outperform placements based on geometric considerations only. [sent-59, score-0.656]
</p><p>14 We also show that the mutual information criterion leads to improved prediction accuracies with a reduced number of sensors compared to several more commonly considered experimental design criteria, such as an entropy-based criterion, and A-optimal, D-optimal and E-optimal design criteria. [sent-60, score-0.94]
</p><p>15 In summary, our main contributions are: • We tackle the problem of maximizing the information-theoretic mutual information criterion of Caselton and Zidek (1984) for optimizing sensor placements, empirically demonstrating its advantages over more commonly used criteria. [sent-61, score-0.859]
</p><p>16 To the best of our knowledge, no such guarantee exists for any other GPbased sensor placement approach, and for any other criterion. [sent-63, score-0.68]
</p><p>17 • We extend our analysis of mutual information to provide theoretical guarantees for placements that are robust against failures of nodes and uncertainties in the model. [sent-66, score-0.644]
</p><p>18 • Extensive empirical evaluation of our methods on several real-world sensor placement problems and comparisons with several classical design criteria. [sent-67, score-0.783]
</p><p>19 Gaussian Processes  In this section, we review Gaussian Processes, the probabilistic model for spatial phenomena that forms the basis of our sensor placement algorithms. [sent-195, score-0.713]
</p><p>20 In order to predict the temperature at one of these locations from the other sensor readings, we need the joint distribution over temperatures at the 54 locations. [sent-199, score-0.704]
</p><p>21 2 Modeling Sensor Data Using Gaussian Processes In our sensor network example, we are not just interested in temperatures at sensed locations, but also at locations where no sensors were placed. [sent-206, score-0.992]
</p><p>22 Figure 3: Example kernel function learned from the Berkeley Lab temperature data: (a) learned covariance function K (x, ·), where x is the location of sensor 41; (b) “ground truth”, interpolated empirical covariance values for the same sensors. [sent-215, score-0.749]
</p><p>23 In spatial statistics this optimization is called sampling or experimental design: ﬁnding the k best sensor locations out of a ﬁnite subset V of possible locations, for example, out of a grid discretization of R2 . [sent-254, score-0.735]
</p><p>24 Intuitively, minimizing this quantity aims at ﬁnding the placement which results in the lowest uncertainty about all uninstrumented locations V \ A after observing the placed sensors A . [sent-259, score-0.793]
</p><p>25 At each iteration, starting with set Ai , the greedy rule used is to add the location y∗ ∈ V \ A that H has highest conditional entropy, y∗ = argmaxy H(Xy | XAi ), H  (4)  that is, the location we are most uncertain about given the sensors placed thus far. [sent-270, score-0.641]
</p><p>26 2 An Improved Design Criterion: Mutual Information The entropy criterion described above is intuitive for ﬁnding sensor placements, since the sensors that are most uncertain about each other should cover the space well. [sent-281, score-0.98]
</p><p>27 Since we expect predictions made from a sensor measurement to be most precise in a region around it, such placements on the boundary are likely to “waste” information. [sent-283, score-0.798]
</p><p>28 Intuitively, this problem arises because the entropy criterion is indirect: the criterion only considers the entropy of the selected sensor locations, rather than considering prediction quality over the space of interest. [sent-286, score-0.791]
</p><p>29 Caselton and Zidek (1984) proposed a different optimization criterion, which searches for the subset of sensor locations that most signiﬁcantly reduces the uncertainty about the estimates in the rest of the space. [sent-290, score-0.653]
</p><p>30 More formally, we consider our space as a discrete set of locations V = S ∪ U composed of two parts: a set S of possible positions where we can place sensors, and another set U of positions of interest, where no sensor placements are possible. [sent-291, score-0.912]
</p><p>31 Furthermore, we show empirically, that even in the sensor selection case, mutual information outperforms entropy on several practical placement problems. [sent-302, score-1.049]
</p><p>32 On the same simple example in Figure 4, this mutual information criterion leads to intuitively appropriate central sensor placements that do not have the “wasted information” property of the entropy criterion. [sent-303, score-1.208]
</p><p>33 We select from 1 to 5 sensor locations out of 16, on the Intel Berkeley temperature data set as discussed in Section 9. [sent-307, score-0.68]
</p><p>34 However, if we implement the simple greedy algorithm for the mutual information criterion (details given below), and optimize designs on real-world placement problems, we see that the greedy algorithm gives almost optimal solutions, as presented in Figure 5. [sent-314, score-0.758]
</p><p>35 1 The Algorithm Our algorithm is greedy, simply adding sensors in sequence, choosing the next sensor which provides the maximum increase in mutual information. [sent-321, score-1.115]
</p><p>36 In contrast, the greedy ¯ mutual information trades off this uncertainty with −H(y | A ), which forces us to pick a y that is ¯ “central” with respect to the unselected locations A , since those “central” locations will result in ¯). [sent-325, score-0.715]
</p><p>37 Using the deﬁnition of conditional entropy in Equation (5), the least conditional entropy H(y | A Algorithm 1 shows our greedy sensor placement algorithm. [sent-326, score-0.987]
</p><p>38 This second characterization intuitively represents “diminishing returns”: adding a sensor y when we only have a small set of sensors A gives us more advantage than adding y to a larger set of sensors A . [sent-335, score-1.19]
</p><p>39 This is exactly the algorithm we proposed in the previous section for optimizing sensor placements (Algorithm 1). [sent-351, score-0.804]
</p><p>40 Intuitively, mutual information is not monotonic when the set of sensor locations approaches V . [sent-357, score-0.919]
</p><p>41 The worst-case setting occurs when the sensor placements A are arbitrarily close to each other, since the entropy part H(y | A ) in Equation (6) can become negative. [sent-366, score-0.884]
</p><p>42 Since most GPs are used for modeling physical phenomena, both the optimal sensor placement and the sensor placement produced by the greedy algorithm can be expected to be spread out, and not condensed to a small region of the sensing area. [sent-367, score-1.469]
</p><p>43 The combination of the 247  K RAUSE , S INGH AND G UESTRIN  analysis in this paper with these new results also yields a constant-factor (1 − 1/e) approximation guarantee for the sensor placement problem with non-uniform costs. [sent-380, score-0.68]
</p><p>44 The greedy rule optimizes a beneﬁt cost ratio, picking the element for which the increase of mutual information divided by the cost of placing the sensor is maximized: More formally, at each step, the greedy algorithm adds the element y∗ such that y∗ = argmaxy∈S \A  ¯ H(y | A ) − H(y | A ) . [sent-383, score-1.023]
</p><p>45 For each one of the k iterations, ﬁnding the next sensor (Line 2) requires O (n) comparisons, and adding the new sensor y ∗ can only change the score of its neighbors (N(y∗ ; ε) ≤ d), thus Line 3 requires O (d · d 3 ) operations. [sent-478, score-0.944]
</p><p>46 Robust Sensor Placements In this section, we show how the mutual information criterion can be extended to optimize for placements which are robust against failures of sensor nodes, and against uncertainty in the model parameters. [sent-487, score-1.169]
</p><p>47 We associate with each location y i ∈ S a discrete random variable Zi such that Zi = 0 indicates that a sensor placed at location yi has failed and will not produce any measurements, and Zi = 1 indicates that the sensor is working correctly. [sent-494, score-1.091]
</p><p>48 Then, the robust mutual information MIR (A ) = EZ [Az ] = ∑ P(z) MI(Az ), z  is an expectation of the mutual information for placement A where all possible failure scenarios are considered. [sent-496, score-0.752]
</p><p>49 However, we can show that even if we do not speciﬁcally optimize for robustness, our sensor placements will be inherently robust: Proposition 11 (Krause et al. [sent-509, score-0.775]
</p><p>50 Proposition 11 even applies if the node failures are not independent, but for example are spatially correlated, as can be expected in practical sensor placement scenarios. [sent-515, score-0.682]
</p><p>51 The goal is typically a sensor placement that covers the space. [sent-548, score-0.656]
</p><p>52 The most common approaches for optimizing sensor placements using geometric criteria assume that sensors have a ﬁxed region (cf. [sent-549, score-1.235]
</p><p>53 3, we experimentally show that when we apply the disk model to nonstationary placement problems, as considered in this paper, the geometric disk model approach leads to worse placements in terms of prediction accuracy, when compared to model-based approaches. [sent-558, score-0.779]
</p><p>54 If many sensors are available then one can optimize the deployment density instead of the placement of individual sensors (Toumpis and Gupta, 2005). [sent-559, score-0.946]
</p><p>55 2 M ODEL - BASED A PPROACHES This paper is an example of a model-based method, one which takes a model of the world (here, a GP) and places sensors to optimize a function of that model (here, mutual information). [sent-564, score-0.643]
</p><p>56 In our sensor placement case, one x would be associated with each location, y would be the measurement at the location, and θ would correspond to the values of the phenomenon at the unobserved locations. [sent-581, score-0.679]
</p><p>57 An example of the relationship between this formalism and sensor placements in GPs, as well as experimental comparisons, are presented in Section 9. [sent-593, score-0.795]
</p><p>58 1 C OMBINATORIAL S EARCH For both geometric and model-based approaches, one must search for the best design or set of sensor locations among a very (usually exponentially) large number of candidate solutions. [sent-635, score-0.737]
</p><p>59 By exploiting submodularity of mutual information, in this paper, we provide the ﬁrst approach to information-theoretic sensor placement which has guarantees both on the runtime and on the quality of the achieved solutions. [sent-647, score-1.069]
</p><p>60 3 Related Work on Extensions In this section, we discuss prior work related to our extensions on sensor placement under model uncertainty (Section 6) and on the use of non-constant cost functions (Section 4. [sent-668, score-0.7]
</p><p>61 In contrast to sensor placement, where locations are chosen to minimize predictive uncertainty, in sparse GP methods, the samples are chosen such that the approximate posterior matches the true posterior (which uses the entire training set) as accurately as possible. [sent-751, score-0.686]
</p><p>62 (2006) presented an approximation algorithm for optimizing node placements for sensor networks using GPs that takes into account both the informativeness of placements (analogously to the discussion in this paper) and the communication cost required to retrieve these measurements. [sent-763, score-1.107]
</p><p>63 1 A Note on the Relationship with the Disk Model The disk model for sensor placement (cf. [sent-776, score-0.74]
</p><p>64 Hence optimizing placements for the disk model criterion is a submodular maximization problem, and the greedy algorithm can guarantee a constant factor (1 − 1/e) OPT approximation guarantee for ﬁnding the placement of k sensors with maximum coverage. [sent-782, score-1.28]
</p><p>65 There is a sense, in which the approach of sensor placements in GPs can be considered a generalization of the disk model. [sent-783, score-0.859]
</p><p>66 If we assume an isotropic GP with local kernel function as the one presented in Figure 8, then a sensor measurement is correlated exactly with the locations within a disk around its location. [sent-784, score-0.781]
</p><p>67 If the process has constant variance, then the greedy algorithm will, for the ﬁrst few sensors placed, only try to achieve a disjoint placement of the disks, and as such behave just like the greedy algorithm for disk covering. [sent-785, score-0.853]
</p><p>68 However, once enough sensors have been placed so that these “disks” start to overlap, the behavior of the two approaches begins to differ: in a disk model there is no advantage in placing sensors that lead to overlapping disks. [sent-786, score-0.912]
</p><p>69 3 A Note on Maximizing the Information Gain Another objective function of interest is the information gain of a sensor placement with respect to some distinguished variables of interest U , that is, IG(A ) = I(A ; U ) = H(U ) − H(U | A ). [sent-798, score-0.674]
</p><p>70 Thus, if we ﬁrst place a sensor at / position 1, placing a sensor at position 2 does help. [sent-804, score-0.985]
</p><p>71 Consider the case where the number p of parameters θ is greater than 1, as in the sensor placement setting, where θ are the uninstrumented T locations. [sent-815, score-0.656]
</p><p>72 Note that generally, GPs are inﬁnite-dimensional objects, so using classical experimental design for ﬁnite linear models only makes limited sense for sensor placement, for example, if an appropriate discretization is chosen. [sent-828, score-0.668]
</p><p>73 5 we compare mutual information with the disk model, with entropy and with other classical experimental design criteria, in terms of prediction accuracy. [sent-858, score-0.645]
</p><p>74 As we increase the number of sensors in the initial deployment, the Root Mean Squared error (RMS) prediction accuracies we get for placements of increasing size converge to those obtained for optimizing the placements based on the empirical covariance matrix. [sent-890, score-1.107]

</p><p>76 (b) Stationary GP estimated for the precipitation data from 160 sensors (S160), nonstationary GPs estimated from 20, 40, 80 and 160 sensors (N20, N40, N80, N160). [sent-907, score-0.879]
</p><p>77 Using the empirical covariance matrix as our process, we use the greedy algorithm to select placements of increasing size, both for mutual information and for entropy. [sent-925, score-0.772]

</p><p>80 Mutual information signiﬁcantly outperforms entropy as a selection criterion—often several sensors would have to be additionally placed for entropy to reach the same level of prediction accuracy as mutual information. [sent-943, score-0.951]
</p><p>81 It can be seen that entropy is again much more likely to place sensors around the border of the sensing area than mutual information. [sent-945, score-0.796]

</p><p>83 Using our algorithms, 22 sensors were chosen using the entropy and mutual information criteria. [sent-970, score-0.752]
</p><p>84 Entropy tends to favor placing sensors near the boundary as observed in Section 3, while mutual information tends to place the sensors on the top and bottom sides, which exhibited the most complexity and should have a higher sensor density. [sent-973, score-1.515]
</p><p>85 UU Hereby, xS denotes measurements at the locations S , among which we choose our placement, x U are the values at the locations of interest (no sensors can be placed there), and w models independent normal measurement noise with constant variance. [sent-980, score-0.747]
</p><p>86 The problem becomes to select the sensor locations A ⊂ S which allow most precise prediction 1 of the variables of interest, in the sense of minimizing the error covariance σ2 (AT A)−1 , where A = −1 ΣSU ΣUU . [sent-982, score-0.702]
</p><p>87 Note that this problem formulation favors the classical design criteria, which are tailored to minimize the error of predicting the values at the target locations U , whereas mutual information and entropy just try to decrease the uncertainty in the entire space. [sent-985, score-0.701]
</p><p>88 In the sensor selection problem however, we have to solve the integral problem, since we face the binary decision of whether a sensor should be placed at a particular location or not. [sent-990, score-1.052]
</p><p>89 We compare the placements using the classical design criteria to those using the mutual information and entropy criteria, and evaluate each of them on the RMS prediction accuracy on the hold-out locations U . [sent-993, score-1.023]
</p><p>90 We can see that even though mutual information optimizes for prediction accuracy in the entire space and not speciﬁcally for the target locations U , it incurs the least RMS prediction error, apart from the placements consisting only of a single sensor. [sent-1012, score-0.766]

</p><p>92 For example when picking placements of size 50 for the precipitation data set, the number of mutual information computations decreased from 7125 to 1172, and the computation time on a Pentium M 1. [sent-1067, score-0.675]
</p><p>93 7, namely that local kernels can be a valuable tool for developing efﬁcient model-based sensor placement algorithms. [sent-1123, score-0.656]
</p><p>94 Another interesting open question is whether an approximation algorithm can be found for optimizing sensor placements subject to submodular cost functions—usually, the more sensors we have to buy, the cheaper they become per unit. [sent-1149, score-1.283]
</p><p>95 Of further interest are also constrained sensor placement problems, in which, for example, the placed sensors have to be connected in a routing tree, or have to lie on a collection of paths. [sent-1152, score-1.084]
</p><p>96 (2006) provide evidence that submodularity can be leveraged to derive approximation algorithms for sensor placement even in these combinatorially even more challenging constrained optimization problems. [sent-1154, score-0.754]
</p><p>97 Conclusions In this paper, we tackle the problem of maximizing mutual information in order to optimize sensor placements. [sent-1157, score-0.79]
</p><p>98 We prove that the exact optimization of mutual information is NP-complete, and provide an approximation algorithm that is within (1 − 1/e) of the maximum mutual information conﬁguration by exploiting the submodularity in the criterion. [sent-1158, score-0.666]

<p>Author: Andreas Krause, Ajit Singh, Carlos Guestrin</p><p>Abstract: When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of ﬁnding the conﬁguration that maximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding signiﬁcant speedups. We also extend our approach to ﬁnd placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodularity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.

<p>Author: Andreas Krause, H. Brendan McMahan, Carlos Guestrin, Anupam Gupta</p><p>Abstract: In many applications, one has to actively select among a set of expensive observations before making an informed decision. For example, in environmental monitoring, we want to select locations to measure in order to most effectively predict spatial phenomena. Often, we want to select observations which are robust against a number of possible objective functions. Examples include minimizing the maximum posterior variance in Gaussian Process regression, robust experimental design, and sensor placement for outbreak detection. In this paper, we present the Submodular Saturation algorithm, a simple and efﬁcient algorithm with strong theoretical approximation guarantees for cases where the possible objective functions exhibit submodularity, an intuitive diminishing returns property. Moreover, we prove that better approximation algorithms do not exist unless NP-complete problems admit efﬁcient algorithms. We show how our algorithm can be extended to handle complex cost functions (incorporating non-unit observation cost or communication and path costs). We also show how the algorithm can be used to near-optimally trade off expected-case (e.g., the Mean Square Prediction Error in Gaussian Process regression) and worst-case (e.g., maximum predictive variance) performance. We show that many important machine learning problems ﬁt our robust submodular observation selection formalism, and provide extensive empirical evaluation on several real-world problems. For Gaussian Process regression, our algorithm compares favorably with state-of-the-art heuristics described in the geostatistics literature, while being simpler, faster and providing theoretical guarantees. For robust experimental design, our algorithm performs favorably compared to SDP-based algorithms. c 2008 Andreas Krause, H. Brendan McMahan, Carlos Guestrin and Anupam Gupta.

<p>Author: Alexandre d'Aspremont, Francis Bach, Laurent El Ghaoui</p><p>Abstract: Given a sample covariance matrix, we examine the problem of maximizing the variance explained by a linear combination of the input variables while constraining the number of nonzero coefﬁcients in this combination. This is known as sparse principal component analysis and has a wide array of applications in machine learning and engineering. We formulate a new semideﬁnite relaxation to this problem and derive a greedy algorithm that computes a full set of good solutions for all target numbers of non zero coefﬁcients, with total complexity O(n3 ), where n is the number of variables. We then use the same relaxation to derive sufﬁcient conditions for global optimality of a solution, which can be tested in O(n3 ) per pattern.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: The linear model with sparsity-favouring prior on the coefﬁcients has important applications in many different domains. In machine learning, most methods to date search for maximum a posteriori sparse solutions and neglect to represent posterior uncertainties. In this paper, we address problems of Bayesian optimal design (or experiment planning), for which accurate estimates of uncertainty are essential. To this end, we employ expectation propagation approximate inference for the linear model with Laplace prior, giving new insight into numerical stability properties and proposing a robust algorithm. We also show how to estimate model hyperparameters by empirical Bayesian maximisation of the marginal likelihood, and propose ideas in order to scale up the method to very large underdetermined problems. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on the application of gene regulatory network identiﬁcation from micro-array expression data, where both the Laplace prior and the active experimental design approach are shown to result in signiﬁcant improvements. We also address the problem of sparse coding of natural images, and show how our framework can be used for compressive sensing tasks. Part of this work appeared in Seeger et al. (2007b).

<p>Author: Bo Jiang, Xuegong Zhang, Tianxi Cai</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most popular and promising classiﬁcation algorithms. After a classiﬁcation rule is constructed via the SVM, it is essential to evaluate its prediction accuracy. In this paper, we develop procedures for obtaining both point and interval estimators for the prediction error. Under mild regularity conditions, we derive the consistency and asymptotic normality of the prediction error estimators for SVM with ﬁnite-dimensional kernels. A perturbationresampling procedure is proposed to obtain interval estimates for the prediction error in practice. With numerical studies on simulated data and a benchmark repository, we recommend the use of interval estimates centered at the cross-validated point estimates for the prediction error. Further applications of the proposed procedure in model evaluation and feature selection are illustrated with two examples.

<p>Author: Onureena Banerjee, Laurent El Ghaoui, Alexandre d'Aspremont</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a Gaussian or binary distribution in such a way that the resulting undirected graphical model is sparse. Our approach is to solve a maximum likelihood problem with an added 1 -norm penalty term. The problem as formulated is convex but the memory requirements and complexity of existing interior point methods are prohibitive for problems with more than tens of nodes. We present two new algorithms for solving problems with at least a thousand nodes in the Gaussian case. Our ﬁrst algorithm uses block coordinate descent, and can be interpreted as recursive 1 -norm penalized regression. Our second algorithm, based on Nesterov’s ﬁrst order method, yields a complexity estimate with a better dependence on problem size than existing interior point methods. Using a log determinant relaxation of the log partition function (Wainwright and Jordan, 2006), we show that these same algorithms can be used to solve an approximate sparse maximum likelihood problem for the binary case. We test our algorithms on synthetic data, as well as on gene expression and senate voting records data.

<p>Author: Eric Perrier, Seiya Imoto, Satoru Miyano</p><p>Abstract: Classical approaches used to learn Bayesian network structure from data have disadvantages in terms of complexity and lower accuracy of their results. However, a recent empirical study has shown that a hybrid algorithm improves sensitively accuracy and speed: it learns a skeleton with an independency test (IT) approach and constrains on the directed acyclic graphs (DAG) considered during the search-and-score phase. Subsequently, we theorize the structural constraint by introducing the concept of super-structure S, which is an undirected graph that restricts the search to networks whose skeleton is a subgraph of S. We develop a super-structure constrained optimal search (COS): its time complexity is upper bounded by O(γm n ), where γm < 2 depends on the maximal degree m of S. Empirically, complexity depends on the average degree m and sparse structures ˜ allow larger graphs to be calculated. Our algorithm is faster than an optimal search by several orders and even ﬁnds more accurate results when given a sound super-structure. Practically, S can be approximated by IT approaches; signiﬁcance level of the tests controls its sparseness, enabling to control the trade-off between speed and accuracy. For incomplete super-structures, a greedily post-processed version (COS+) still enables to signiﬁcantly outperform other heuristic searches.

<p>Author: Gustavo Camps-Valls, Juan Gutiérrez, Gabriel Gómez-Pérez, Jesús Malo</p><p>Abstract: Conventional SVM-based image coding methods are founded on independently restricting the distortion in every image coefﬁcient at some particular image representation. Geometrically, this implies allowing arbitrary signal distortions in an n-dimensional rectangle deﬁned by the ε-insensitivity zone in each dimension of the selected image representation domain. Unfortunately, not every image representation domain is well-suited for such a simple, scalar-wise, approach because statistical and/or perceptual interactions between the coefﬁcients may exist. These interactions imply that scalar approaches may induce distortions that do not follow the image statistics and/or are perceptually annoying. Taking into account these relations would imply using non-rectangular εinsensitivity regions (allowing coupled distortions in different coefﬁcients), which is beyond the conventional SVM formulation. In this paper, we report a condition on the suitable domain for developing efﬁcient SVM image coding schemes. We analytically demonstrate that no linear domain fulﬁlls this condition because of the statistical and perceptual inter-coefﬁcient relations that exist in these domains. This theoretical result is experimentally conﬁrmed by comparing SVM learning in previously reported linear domains and in a recently proposed non-linear perceptual domain that simultaneously reduces the statistical and perceptual relations (so it is closer to fulﬁlling the proposed condition). These results highlight the relevance of an appropriate choice of the image representation before SVM learning.

Problem Statement: The Diagonal Jacobian Condition Image coding schemes based on support vector machines (SVM) have been successfully introduced in the literature. SVMs have been used in the spatial domain (Robinson and Kecman, 2000), in the block-DCT domain (Robinson and Kecman, 2003), and in the wavelet domain (Ahmed, 2005; Jiao et al., 2005). These coding methods take advantage of the ability of the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm for function approximation using a small number of parameters (signal samples, or ¨ support vectors) (Smola and Scholkopf, 2004). In all current SVM-based image coding techniques, a representation of the image is described by the entropy-coded weights associated to the support vectors necessary to approximate the signal with a given accuracy. Relaxing the accuracy bounds reduces the number of needed support vectors. In a given representation domain, reducing the number of support vectors increases the compression ratio at the expense of bigger distortion (lower image quality). By applying the standard SVR formulation, a certain amount of distortion in each sample of the image representation is allowed. In the original formulation, scalar restrictions on the errors are introduced using a constant ε-insensitivity value for every sample. ´ Recently, this procedure has been reﬁned by Gomez-P´ rez et al. (2005) using a proﬁle-dependent e SVR (Camps-Valls et al., 2001) that considers a different ε for each sample or frequency. This frequency-dependent insensitivity, ε f , accounts for the fact that, according to simple (linear) perception models, not every sample in linear frequency domains (such as DCT or wavelets) contributes to the perceived distortion in the same way. Despite different domains have been proposed for SVM training (spatial domain, block-DCT and wavelets) and different ε insensitivities per sample have been proposed, in conventional SVR formulation, the particular distortions introduced by regression in the different samples are not coupled. In all the reported SVM-based image coding schemes, the RBF kernel is used and the penalization parameter is ﬁxed to an arbitrarily large value. In this setting, considering n-sample signals as n-dimensional vectors, the SVR guarantees that the approximated vectors are conﬁned in n-dimensional rectangles around the original vectors. These rectangles are just n-dimensional cubes in the standard formulation or they have certain elongation if different ε f are considered in each axis, f . Therefore, in all the reported SVM-based coding methods, these rectangles are always oriented along the axes of the (linear) image representation. According to this, a common feature of these (scalar-wise) approaches is that they give rise to decoupled distortions in each dimension. P´ rez-Cruz et al. (2002) proposed a hyperspherical insensitivity zone to correct the penalization e factor in each dimension of multi-output regression problems, but again, restrictions to each sample were still uncoupled. This scalar-wise strategy is not the best option in domains where the different dimensions of the image representation are not independent. For instance, consider the situation where actually independent components, r f , are obtained from a given image representation, y, applying some eventually non-linear transform, R: R y −→ r. In this case, SVM regression with scalar-wise error restriction makes sense in the r domain. However, the original y domain will not be suitable for the standard SVM regression unless the matrix ∇R is diagonal (up to any permutation of the dimensions, that is, only one non-zero element per row). Therefore, if transforms that achieve independence have non-diagonal Jacobian, scalar-wise restrictions in the original (coupled coefﬁcients) domain y are not allowed. 50 O N THE S UITABLE D OMAIN FOR SVM T RAINING IN I MAGE C ODING y2 1 −0,5 −0,5 0,4 R= r2 y1 r1 R−1 = 0,83 −0,83 0,67 −1,67 Figure 1: Insensitivity regions in different representation domains, y (left) and r (right), related by a non-diagonal transform ∇R and its inverse ∇R−1 . Figure 1 illustrates this situation. The shaded region in the right plot (r domain) represents the n-dimensional box determined by the ε f insensitivities in each dimension ( f =1,2), in which a scalar-wise approach is appropriate due to independence among signal coefﬁcients. Given that the particular ∇R transform is not diagonal, the corresponding shaded region in the left plot (the original y domain) is not aligned along the axes of the representation. This has negative implications: note that for the highlighted points, smaller distortions in both dimensions in the y domain (as implied by SVM with tighter but scalar ε f insensitivities) do not necessarily imply lying inside the insensitivity region in the ﬁnal truly independent (and meaningful) r domain. Therefore, the original y domain is not suitable for the direct application of conventional SVM, and consequently, non-trivial coupled insensitivity regions are required. Summarizing, in the image coding context, the condition for an image representation y to be strictly suitable for conventional SVM learning is that the transform that maps the original representation y to an independent coefﬁcient representation r must be locally diagonal. As will be reviewed below, independence among coefﬁcients (and the transforms to obtain them) may be deﬁned in both statistical and perceptual terms (Hyvarinen et al., 2001; Malo et al., 2001; Epifanio et al., 2003; Malo et al., 2006). On the one hand, a locally diagonal relation to a statistically independent representation is desirable because independently induced distortions (as the conventional SVM approach does) will preserve the statistics of the distorted signal, that is, it will not introduce artiﬁcial-looking artifacts. On the other hand, a locally diagonal relation to a perceptually 51 ´ ´ ´ C AMPS -VALLS , G UTI E RREZ , G OMEZ -P E REZ AND M ALO independent representation is desirable because independently induced distortions do not give rise to increased subjective distortions due to non-trivial masking or facilitation interactions between the distortions in each dimension (Watson and Solomon, 1997). In this work, we show that conventional linear domains do not fulﬁll the diagonal Jacobian condition in either the statistical case or in the perceptual case. This theoretical result is experimentally conﬁrmed by comparing SVM learning in previously reported linear domains (Robinson and Kecman, 2003; G´ mez-P´ rez et al., 2005) and in a recently proposed non-linear perceptual domain o e that simultaneously reduces the statistical and the perceptual relations (Malo et al., 2006), thus, this non-linear perceptual domain is closer to fulﬁlling the proposed condition. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the fact that linear coefﬁcients of the image representations commonly used for SVM training are neither statistically independent nor perceptually independent. Section 3 shows that transforms for obtaining statistical and/or perceptual independence from linear domains have non-diagonal Jacobian. This suggests that there is room to improve the performance of conventional SVM learning reported in linear domains. In Section 4, we propose the use of a perceptual representation for SVM training because it strictly fulﬁlls the diagonal Jacobian condition in the perceptual sense and increases the statistical independence among coefﬁcients, bringing it closer to fulﬁlling the condition in the statistical sense. The experimental image coding results conﬁrm the superiority of this domain for SVM training in Section 5. Section 6 presents the conclusions and ﬁnal remarks. 2. Statistical and Perceptual Relations Among Image Coefﬁcients Statistical independence among the coefﬁcients of a signal representation refers to the fact that the joint PDF of the class of signals to be considered can be expressed as a product of the marginal PDFs in each dimension (Hyvarinen et al., 2001). Simple (second-order) descriptions of statistical dependence use the non-diagonal nature of the covariance matrix (Clarke, 1985; Gersho and Gray, 1992). More recent and accurate descriptions use higher-order moments, mutual information, or the non-Gaussian nature (sparsity) of marginal PDFs (Hyvarinen et al., 2001; Simoncelli, 1997). Perceptual independence refers to the fact that the visibility of errors in coefﬁcients of an image may depend on the energy of neighboring coefﬁcients, a phenomenon known in the perceptual literature as masking or facilitation (Watson and Solomon, 1997). Perceptual dependence has been formalized just up to second order, and this may be described by the non-Euclidean nature of the perceptual metric matrix (Malo et al., 2001; Epifanio et al., 2003; Malo et al., 2006). 2.1 Statistical Relations In recent years, a variety of approaches, known collectively as “independent component analysis” (ICA), have been developed to exploit higher-order statistics for the purpose of achieving a unique linear solution for coefﬁcient independence (Hyvarinen et al., 2001). The basis functions obtained when these methods are applied to images are spatially localized and selective for both orientation and spatial frequency (Olshausen and Field, 1996; Bell and Sejnowski, 1997). Thus, they are similar to basis functions of multi-scale wavelet representations. Despite its name, linear ICA does not actually produce statistically independent coefﬁcients when applied to photographic images. Intuitively, independence would seem unlikely, since images are not formed from linear superpositions of independent patterns: the typical combination rule for the elements of an image is occlusion. Empirically, the coefﬁcients of natural image decom52 O N THE S UITABLE D OMAIN FOR SVM T RAINING IN I MAGE C ODING | f | = 10.8 cpd | f | = 24.4 cpd −20 −10 −10 fy (cpd) −30 −20 fy (cpd) −30 0 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 −30 −20 −10 0 f (cpd) 10 20 30 −30 x −20 −10 0 f (cpd) 10 20 30 x Figure 2: Statistical interaction of two particular coefﬁcients of the local Fourier Transform with their neighbors in a natural image database. The absolute value of the frequency of these coefﬁcients is | f | = 10.8 and | f | = 24.4 cycles/degree (cpd). positions in spatially localized oscillating basis functions are found to be fairly well decorrelated (i.e., their covariance is almost zero). However, the amplitudes of coefﬁcients at nearby spatial positions, orientations, and scales are highly correlated (even with orthonormal transforms) (Simoncelli, ´ 1997; Buccigrossi and Simoncelli, 1999; Wainwright et al., 2001; Hyvarinen et al., 2003; Guti errez et al., 2006; Malo et al., 2006; Malo and Guti´ rrez, 2006). This suggests that achieving statistical e independence requires the introduction of non-linearities beyond linear ICA transforms. Figure 2 reproduces one of many results that highlight the presence of statistical relations of natural image coefﬁcients in block PCA or linear ICA-like domains: the energy of spatially localized oscillating ﬁlters is correlated with the energy of neighboring ﬁlters in scale and orientation (see Guti´ rrez et al., 2006). A remarkable feature is that the interaction width increases with frequency, e as has been reported in other domains, for example, wavelets (Buccigrossi and Simoncelli, 1999; Wainwright et al., 2001; Hyvarinen et al., 2003), and block-DCT (Malo et al., 2006). In order to remove the remaining statistical relations in the linear domains y, non-linear ICA methods are necessary (Hyvarinen et al., 2001; Lin, 1999; Karhunen et al., 2000; Jutten and Karhunen, 2003). Without lack of generality, non-linear ICA transforms can be schematically understood as a two-stage process (Malo and Guti´ rrez, 2006): e T R (( y hh x hh (( r, (1) R−1 T−1 where x is the image representation in the spatial domain, and T is a global unitary linear transform that removes second-order and eventually higher-order relations among coefﬁcients in the spatial domain. Particular examples of T include block PCA, linear ICAs, DCT or wavelets. In the ICA literature notation, T is the separating matrix and T−1 is the mixing matrix. The second transform 53 ´ ´ ´ C AMPS -VALLS , G UTI E RREZ , G OMEZ -P E REZ AND M ALO R is an additional non-linearity that is introduced in order to remove the statistical relations that still remain in the y domain. 2.2 Perceptual Relations Perceptual dependence among coefﬁcients in different image representations can be understood by using the current model of V1 cortex. This model can also be summarized by the two-stage (linear and non-linear) process described in Equation (1). In this perceptual case, T is also a linear ﬁlter bank applied to the original input image in the spatial domain. This ﬁlter bank represents the linear behavior of V1 neurons whose receptive ﬁelds happen to be similar to wavelets or linear ICA basis functions (Olshausen and Field, 1996; Bell and Sejnowski, 1997). The second transform, R, is a non-linear function that accounts for the masking and facilitation phenomena that have been reported in the linear y domain (Foley, 1994; Watson and Solomon, 1997). Section 3.2 gives a parametric expression for the second non-linear stage, R: the divisive normalization model (Heeger, 1992; Foley, 1994; Watson and Solomon, 1997). This class of models is based on psychophysical experiments assuming that the last domain, r, is perceptually Euclidean (i.e., perfect perceptual independence). An additional conﬁrmation of this assumption is the success of (Euclidean) subjective image distortion measures deﬁned in that domain (Teo and Heeger, 1994). Straightforward application of Riemannian geometry to obtain the perceptual metric matrix in other domains shows that the coefﬁcients of linear domains x and y, or any other linear transform of them, are not perceptually independent (Epifanio et al., 2003). Figure 3 illustrates the presence of perceptual relations between coefﬁcients when using linear block frequency or wavelet-like domains, y: the cross-masking behavior. In this example, the visibility of the distortions added on top of the background image made of periodic patterns has to be assessed. This is a measure of the sensitivity of a particular perceptual mechanism to distortions in that dimension, ∆y f , when mechanisms tuned to other dimensions are simultaneously active, that is, y f = 0, with f = f . As can be observed, low frequency noise is more visible in high frequency backgrounds than in low frequency backgrounds (e.g., left image). Similarly, high frequency noise is more visible in low frequency backgrounds than in high frequency ones (e.g., right image). That is to say, a signal of a speciﬁc frequency strongly masks the corresponding frequency analyzer, but it induces a smaller sensitivity reduction in the analyzers that are tuned to different frequencies. In other words, the reduction in sensitivity of a speciﬁc analyzer gets larger as the distance between the background frequency and the frequency of the analyzer gets smaller. The response of each frequency analyzer not only depends on the energy of the signal for that frequency band, but also on the energy of the signal in other frequency bands (cross-masking). This implies that a different amount of noise in each frequency band may be acceptable depending on the energy of that frequency band and on the energy of neighboring bands. This is what we have called perceptual dependence among different coefﬁcients in the y domain. At this point, it is important to stress the similarity between the set of computations to obtain statistically decoupled image coefﬁcients and the known stages of biological vision. In fact, it has been hypothesized that biological visual systems have organized their sensors to exploit the particular statistics of the signals they have to process. See Barlow (2001), Simoncelli and Olshausen (2001), and Simoncelli (2003) for reviews on this hypothesis. In particular, both the linear and the non-linear stages of the cortical processing have been successfully derived using redundancy reduction arguments: nowadays, the same class of linear 54 O N THE S UITABLE D OMAIN FOR SVM T RAINING IN I MAGE C ODING 3 cpd 6 cpd 12 cpd 24 cpd Figure 3: Illustrative example of perceptual dependence (cross-masking phenomenon).

Sampling frequency assumes that these images subtend an angle of 3 deg. stage T is used in transform coding algorithms and in vision models (Olshausen and Field, 1996; Bell and Sejnowski, 1997; Taubman and Marcellin, 2001), and new evidence supports the same idea for the second non-linear stage (Schwartz and Simoncelli, 2001; Malo and Guti´ rrez, 2006). e According to this, the statistical and perceptual transforms, R, that remove the above relations from the linear domains, y, would be very similar if not the same. 3. Statistical and Perceptual Independence Imply Non-diagonal Jacobian In this section, we show that both statistical redundancy reduction transforms (e.g., non-linear ICA) and perceptual independence transforms (e.g., divisive normalization), have non-diagonal Jacobian for any linear image representation, so they are not strictly suitable for conventional SVM training. 3.1 Non-diagonal Jacobian in Non-linear ICA Transforms One possible approach for dealing with global non-linear ICA is to act differentially by breaking the problem into local linear pieces that can then be integrated to obtain the global independent coefﬁcient domain (Malo and Guti´ rrez, 2006). Each differential sub-problem around a particular e point (image) can be locally solved using the standard linear ICA methods restricted to the neighbors of that point (Lin, 1999). Using the differential approach in the context of a two-stage process such as the one in Equation (1), it can be shown that (Malo and Guti´ rrez, 2006): e r = r0 + Z x x0 T (x ) dx = r0 + Z x x0 ∇R(Tx ) T dx , (2) where T (x ) is the local separating matrix for a neighborhood of the image x , and T is the global separating matrix for the whole PDF. Therefore, the Jacobian of the second non-linear stage is: ∇R(y) = ∇R(Tx) = T (x) T−1 . 55 (3) ´ ´ ´ C AMPS -VALLS , G UTI E RREZ , G OMEZ -P E REZ AND M ALO As local linear independent features around a particular image, x, differ in general from global linear independent features, that is, T (x) = T, the above product is not the identity nor diagonal in general. 3.2 Non-diagonal Jacobian in Non-linear Perceptual Transforms The current response model for the cortical frequency analyzers is non-linear (Heeger, 1992; Watson and Solomon, 1997). The outputs of the ﬁlters of the ﬁrst linear stage, y, undergo a non-linear sigmoid transform in which the energy of each linear coefﬁcient is weighted by a linear Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) (Campbell and Robson, 1968; Malo et al., 1997) and is further normalized by a combination of the energies of neighbor coefﬁcients in frequency, r f = R(y) f = sgn(y f ) |α f y f |γ , β f + ∑n =1 h f f |α f y f |γ f (4) where α f (Figure 4[top left]) are CSF-like weights, β f (Figure 4[top right]) control the sharpness of the response saturation for each coefﬁcient, γ is the so called excitation exponent, and the matrix h f f determines the interaction neighborhood in the non-linear normalization of the energy. This interaction matrix models the cross-masking behavior (cf. Section 2.2). The interaction in this matrix is assumed to be Gaussian (Watson and Solomon, 1997), and its width increases with the frequency. Figure 4[bottom] shows two examples of this Gaussian interaction for two particular coefﬁcients in a local Fourier domain. Note that the width of the perceptual interaction neighborhood increases with the frequency in the same way as the width of the statistical interaction neighborhood shown in Figure 2. We used a value of γ = 2 in the experiments. Taking derivatives in the general divisive normalization model, Equation (4), we obtain ∇R(y) f f = sgn(y f )γ α f |α f y f |γ |α f y f |γ−1 α f |α f y f |γ−1 δf f − hf f β f + ∑n =1 h f f |α f y f |γ (β f + ∑n =1 h f f |α f y f |γ )2 f f , (5) which is not diagonal because of the interaction matrix, h, which describes the cross-masking between each frequency f and the remaining f = f . Note that the intrinsic non-linear nature of both the statistical and perceptual transforms, Equations (3) and (5), makes the above results true for any linear domain under consideration. Speciﬁcally, if any other possible linear domain for image representation is considered, y = T y, then the Jacobian of the corresponding independence transform, R , is ∇R (y ) = ∇R(y) T −1 , which, in general, will also be non-diagonal because of the non-diagonal and point-dependent nature of ∇R(y). To summarize, since no linear domain fulﬁlls the diagonal Jacobian condition in either statistical or perceptual terms, the negative situation illustrated in Figure 1 may occur when using SVM in these domains. Therefore, improved results could be obtained if SVM learning were applied after some transform achieving independent coefﬁcients, R. 4. SVM Learning in a Perceptually Independent Representation In order to conﬁrm the above theoretical results (i.e., the unsuitability of linear representation domains for SVM learning) and to assess the eventual gain that can be obtained from training SVR 56 O N THE S UITABLE D OMAIN FOR SVM T RAINING IN I MAGE C ODING 0.04 αf 0.015 βf 0.03 0.012 0.02 0.009 0.006 0.01 0.003 0 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 0 f (frequency cycles/degree) 4 8 | f | = 10.8 cpd 16 20 24 28 32 | f | = 24.4 cpd −30 −20 −20 −10 −10 f (cpd) −30 0 y 0 y f (cpd) 12 f (frequency cycles/degree) 10 10 20 20 30 −30 −20 −10 0 fx (cpd) 10 20 30 −30 30 −20 −10 0 fx (cpd) 10 20 30 Figure 4: Parameters of the perceptual model: α f (top left), β f (top right). Bottom ﬁgures represent perceptual interaction neighborhoods h f f of two particular coefﬁcients of the local Fourier domain. in a more appropriate domain, we should compare the performance of SVRs in previously reported linear domains (e.g., block-DCT or wavelets) and in one of the proposed non-linear domains (either the statistically independent domain or the perceptually independent domain). Exploration of the statistical independence transform may have academic interest but, in its present formulation, it is not practical for coding purposes: direct application of non-linear ICA as in Equation (2) is very time-consuming for high dimensional vectors since lots of local ICA computations are needed to transform each block, and a very large image database is needed for a robust and signiﬁcant computation of R. Besides, an equally expensive differential approach is also needed to compute the inverse R−1 for image decoding. In contrast, the perceptual non-linearity (and its inverse) are analytical. These analytical expressions are feasible for reasonable block sizes, and there are efﬁcient iterative methods that can be used for larger vectors (Malo et al., 2006). In this paper, we explore the use of a psychophysically-based divisive normalized domain: ﬁrst compute a block-DCT transform and then apply the divisive normalization model described above for each block. The results will be compared to the ﬁrst competitive SVM coding results (Robinson 57 ´ ´ ´ C AMPS -VALLS , G UTI E RREZ , G OMEZ -P E REZ AND M ALO ´ and Kecman, 2003) and the posterior improvements reported by G omez-P´ rez et al. (2005), both e formulated in the linear block-DCT domain. As stated in Section 2, by construction, the proposed domain is perceptually Euclidean with perceptually independent components. The Euclidean nature of this domain has an additional beneﬁt: the ε-insensitivity design is very simple because a constant value is appropriate due to the constant perceptual relevance of all coefﬁcients. Thus, direct application of the standard SVR method is theoretically appropriate in this domain. Moreover, beyond its built-in perceptual beneﬁts, this psychophysically-based divisive normalization has attractive statistical properties: it strongly reduces the mutual information between the ﬁnal coefﬁcients r (Malo et al., 2006). This is not surprising according to the hypothesis that try to explain the early stages of biological vision systems using information theory arguments (Barlow, 1961; Simoncelli and Olshausen, 2001). Speciﬁcally, dividing the energy of each linear coefﬁcient by the energy of the neighbors, which are statistically related with it, cf. Figure 2, gives coefﬁcients with reduced statistical dependence. Moreover, as the empirical non-linearities of perception have been reproduced using non-linear ICA in Equation (2) (Malo and Guti´ rrez, 2006), the empirical die visive normalization can be seen as a convenient parametric way to obtain statistical independence. 5. Performance of SVM Learning in Different Domains In this section, we analyze the performance of SVM-based coding algorithms in linear and nonlinear domains through rate-distortion curves and explicit examples for visual comparison. In addition, we discuss how SVM selects support vectors in these domains to represent the image features. 5.1 Model Development and Experimental Setup In the (linear) block-DCT domain, y, we use the method introduced by Robinson and Kecman (2003) (RKi-1), in which the SVR is trained to learn a ﬁxed (low-pass) number of DCT coefﬁcients ´ (those with frequency bigger than 20 cycl/deg are discarded); and the method proposed by G omezP´ rez et al. (2005) (CSF-SVR), in which the relevance of all DCT coefﬁcients is weighted according e to the CSF criterion using an appropriately modulated ε f . In the non-linear domain, r, we use the SVR with constant insensitivity parameter ε (NL-SVR). In all cases, the block-size is 16×16, that is, y, r ∈ R256 . The behavior of JPEG standard is also included in the experiments for comparison purposes. As stated in Section 1, we used the RBF kernel and arbitrarily large penalization parameter in every SVR case. In all experiments, we trained the SVR models without the bias term, and modelled the absolute value of the DCT, y, or response coefﬁcients, r. All the remaining free parameters (ε-insensitivity and Gaussian width of the RBF kernel σ) were optimized for all the considered models and different compression ratios. In the NL-SVM case, the parameters of the divisive normalization used in the experiments are shown in Figure 4. After training, the signal is described by the uniformly quantized Lagrange multipliers of the support vectors needed to keep the regression error below the thresholds ε f . The last step is entropy coding of the quantized weights. The compression ratio is controlled by a factor applied to the thresholds, ε f . 58 O N THE S UITABLE D OMAIN FOR SVM T RAINING IN I MAGE C ODING 5.2 Model Comparison In order to assess the quality of the coded images, three different measures were used: the standard ´ (Euclidean) RMSE, the Maximum Perceptual Error (MPE) (Malo et al., 2000; G omez-P´ rez et al., e 2005; Malo et al., 2006) and the also perceptually meaningful Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index (Wang et al., 2004). Eight standard 256×256 monochrome 8 bits/pix images were used in the experiments. Average rate-distortion curves are plotted in Figure 5 in the range [0.05, 0.6] bits/pix (bpp). According to these entropy-per-sample data, original ﬁle size was 64 KBytes in every case, while the compressed image sizes were in the range [0.4, 4.8] KBytes. This implies that the compression ratios were in the range [160:1, 13:1]. In general, a clear gain over standard JPEG is obtained by all SVM-based methods. According to the standard Euclidean MSE point of view, the performance of RKi-1 and CSF-SVR algorithms is basically the same (note the overlapped curves in Figure 5(a)). However, it is widely known that the MSE results are not useful to represent the subjective quality of images, as extensively reported elsewhere (Girod, 1993; Teo and Heeger, 1994; Watson and Malo, 2002). When using more appropriate (perceptually meaningful) quality measures (Figures 5(b)-(c)), the CSF-SVR obtains a certain advantage over the RKi-1 algorithm for all compression rates, which was already reported by G´ mez-P´ rez et al. (2005). In all measures, and for the whole considered entropy range, the o e proposed NL-SVR clearly outperforms all previously reported methods, obtaining a noticeable gain at medium-to-high compression ratios (between 0.1 bpp (80:1) and 0.3 bpp (27:1)). Taking into account that the recommended bit rate for JPEG is about 0.5 bpp, from Figure 5 we can also conclude that the proposed technique achieves the similar quality levels at a lower bit rate in the range [0.15, 0.3] bpp. Figure 6 shows representative visual results of the considered SVM strategies on standard images (Lena and Barbara) at the same bit rate (0.3 bpp, 27:1 compression ratio or 2.4 KBytes in 256×256 images). The visual inspection conﬁrms that the numerical gain in MPE and SSIM shown in Figure 5 is also perceptually signiﬁcant. Some conclusions can be extracted from this ﬁgure. ´ First, as previously reported by Gomez-P´ rez et al. (2005), RKi-1 leads to poorer (blocky) results e because of the crude approximation of the CSF (as an ideal low-pass ﬁlter) and the equal relevance applied to the low-frequency DCT-coefﬁcients. Second, despite the good performance yielded by the CSF-SVR approach to avoid blocking effects, it is worth noting that high frequency details are smoothed (e.g., see Barbara’s scarf). These effects are highly alleviated by introducing SVR in the non-linear domain. See, for instance, Lena’s eyes, her hat’s feathers or the better reproduction of the high frequency pattern in Barbara’s clothes. Figure 7 shows the results obtained by all considered methods at a very high compression ratio for the Barbara image (0.05 bpp, 160:1 compression ratio or 0.4 KBytes in 256×256 images). This experiment is just intended to show the limits of methods performance since it is out of the recommended rate ranges. Even though this scenario is unrealistic, differences among methods are still noticeable: the proposed NL-SVR method reduces the blocky effects (note for instance that the face is better reproduced). This is due to a better distribution of support vectors in the perceptually independent domain. 5.3 Support Vector Distribution The observed different perceptual image quality obtained with each approach is a direct consequence of support vector distribution in different domains.

Speciﬁcally, a block of Barbara’s scarf at different compression ratios is used for illustration purposes. The RKi-1 approach (Robinson and Kecman, 2003) uses a constant ε but, in order to consider the low subjective relevance of the high-frequency region, the corresponding coefﬁcients are neglected. As a result, this approach only allocates support vectors in the low/medium frequency regions. The CSF-SVR approach uses a variable ε according to the CSF and gives rise to a more natural concentration of support vectors in the low/medium frequency region, which captures medium to high frequency details at lower compression rates (0.5 bits/pix). Note that the number of support vectors is bigger than in the RKi-1 approach, but it selects some necessary high-frequency coefﬁcients to keep the error below the selected threshold. However, for bigger compression ratios (0.3 bits/pix), it misrepresents some high frequency, yet relevant, features (e.g., the peak from the stripes). The NL-SVM approach works in the non-linear transform domain, in which a more uniform coverage 62 O N THE S UITABLE D OMAIN FOR SVM T RAINING IN I MAGE C ODING (a) (b) (c) 0 200 10 100 0 200 5 5 15 0 0 20 30 25 20 10 20 30 fy (cpd) 10 0 fy (cpd) 30 10 fx (cpd) 0 200 5 10 100 0 200 5 10 100 15 25 10 30 20 30 f (cpd) y 10 0 30 10 0.5 20 30 25 20 5 1 0 0 20 30 0 1.5 15 15 0 fy (cpd) 30 0 fx (cpd) 20 25 20 0 fx (cpd) fx (cpd) 20 30 25 20 30 10 0.5 15 0 5 1 10 100 15 0 1.5 25 20 f (cpd) y 10 30 fy (cpd) 0 0 fx (cpd) fx (cpd) Figure 8: Signal in different domains and the selected support vectors by the SVM models in a block of the Barbara image at 0.3 bits/pix (top row) and 0.5 bits/pix (bottom row).

It is important to remark that, for a given method (or domain), tightening ε f implies (1) considering more support vectors, and (2) an increase in entropy (top and bottom rows in Figure 8, 0.3 bpp to 0.5 bpp). However, note that the relevant measure is the entropy and not the number of support vectors: even though the number of selected support vectors in the r domain is higher, their variance is lower, thus giving rise to the same entropy after entropy coding. 6. Conclusions In this paper, we have reported a condition on the suitable domain for developing efﬁcient SVM image coding schemes. The so-called diagonal Jacobian condition states that SVM regression with scalar-wise error restriction in a particular domain makes sense only if the transform that maps this domain to an independent coefﬁcient representation is locally diagonal. We have demonstrated that, 63 ´ ´ ´ C AMPS -VALLS , G UTI E RREZ , G OMEZ -P E REZ AND M ALO in general, linear domains do not fulﬁll this condition because non-trivial statistical and perceptual inter-coefﬁcient relations do exist in these domains. This theoretical ﬁnding has been experimentally conﬁrmed by observing that improved compression results are obtained when SVM is applied in a non-linear perceptual domain that starts from the same linear domain used by previously reported SVM-based image coding schemes. These results highlight the relevance of an appropriate image representation choice before SVM learning. Further work is tied to the use of SVM-based coding schemes in statistically, rather than perceptually, independent non-linear ICA domains. In order to do so, local PCA instead of local ICA may be used in the local-to-global differential approach (Malo and Guti´ rrez, 2006) to speed up the e non-linear computation.

<p>Author: Andreas Krause, Ajit Singh, Carlos Guestrin</p><p>Abstract: When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of ﬁnding the conﬁguration that maximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding signiﬁcant speedups. We also extend our approach to ﬁnd placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodularity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.

<p>Author: Andreas Krause, H. Brendan McMahan, Carlos Guestrin, Anupam Gupta</p><p>Abstract: In many applications, one has to actively select among a set of expensive observations before making an informed decision. For example, in environmental monitoring, we want to select locations to measure in order to most effectively predict spatial phenomena. Often, we want to select observations which are robust against a number of possible objective functions. Examples include minimizing the maximum posterior variance in Gaussian Process regression, robust experimental design, and sensor placement for outbreak detection. In this paper, we present the Submodular Saturation algorithm, a simple and efﬁcient algorithm with strong theoretical approximation guarantees for cases where the possible objective functions exhibit submodularity, an intuitive diminishing returns property. Moreover, we prove that better approximation algorithms do not exist unless NP-complete problems admit efﬁcient algorithms. We show how our algorithm can be extended to handle complex cost functions (incorporating non-unit observation cost or communication and path costs). We also show how the algorithm can be used to near-optimally trade off expected-case (e.g., the Mean Square Prediction Error in Gaussian Process regression) and worst-case (e.g., maximum predictive variance) performance. We show that many important machine learning problems ﬁt our robust submodular observation selection formalism, and provide extensive empirical evaluation on several real-world problems. For Gaussian Process regression, our algorithm compares favorably with state-of-the-art heuristics described in the geostatistics literature, while being simpler, faster and providing theoretical guarantees. For robust experimental design, our algorithm performs favorably compared to SDP-based algorithms. c 2008 Andreas Krause, H. Brendan McMahan, Carlos Guestrin and Anupam Gupta.

<p>Author: Thomas G. Dietterich, Guohua Hao, Adam Ashenfelter</p><p>Abstract: Conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs) provide a ﬂexible and powerful model for sequence labeling problems. However, existing learning algorithms are slow, particularly in problems with large numbers of potential input features and feature combinations. This paper describes a new algorithm for training CRFs via gradient tree boosting. In tree boosting, the CRF potential functions are represented as weighted sums of regression trees, which provide compact representations of feature interactions. So the algorithm does not explicitly consider the potentially large parameter space. As a result, gradient tree boosting scales linearly in the order of the Markov model and in the order of the feature interactions, rather than exponentially as in previous algorithms based on iterative scaling and gradient descent. Gradient tree boosting also makes it possible to use instance weighting (as in C4.5) and surrogate splitting (as in CART) to handle missing values. Experimental studies of the effectiveness of these two methods (as well as standard imputation and indicator feature methods) show that instance weighting is the best method in most cases when feature values are missing at random.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: The linear model with sparsity-favouring prior on the coefﬁcients has important applications in many different domains. In machine learning, most methods to date search for maximum a posteriori sparse solutions and neglect to represent posterior uncertainties. In this paper, we address problems of Bayesian optimal design (or experiment planning), for which accurate estimates of uncertainty are essential. To this end, we employ expectation propagation approximate inference for the linear model with Laplace prior, giving new insight into numerical stability properties and proposing a robust algorithm. We also show how to estimate model hyperparameters by empirical Bayesian maximisation of the marginal likelihood, and propose ideas in order to scale up the method to very large underdetermined problems. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on the application of gene regulatory network identiﬁcation from micro-array expression data, where both the Laplace prior and the active experimental design approach are shown to result in signiﬁcant improvements. We also address the problem of sparse coding of natural images, and show how our framework can be used for compressive sensing tasks. Part of this work appeared in Seeger et al. (2007b). The gene network identiﬁcation application appears in Steinke et al. (2007).

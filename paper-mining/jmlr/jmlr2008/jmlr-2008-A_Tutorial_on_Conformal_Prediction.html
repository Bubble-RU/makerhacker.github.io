<h1>7 jmlr-2008-A Tutorial on Conformal Prediction</h1>

Given an error probability ĂŽÄž, together with a method that makes a prediction y of a label Ă&lsaquo;&dagger; y, it produces a set of labels, typically containing y, that also contains y with probability 1 Ă˘&circ;&rsquo; ĂŽÄž. Ă&lsaquo;&dagger; Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for producing y: a nearest-neighbor method, a Ă&lsaquo;&dagger; support-vector machine, ridge regression, etc. Conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted successively, each one being revealed before the next is predicted. The most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled independently from the same distribution, then the successive predictions will be right 1 Ă˘&circ;&rsquo; ĂŽÄž of the time, even though they are based on an accumulating data set rather than on independent data sets.

Recent research explores some extensions of this large margin based method to the multicategory case. We show a moment bound for the socalled multi-hinge loss minimizers based on two kinds of complexity constraints: entropy with bracketing and empirical entropy.

<p>Author: Xing Sun, Andrew B. Nobel</p><p>Abstract: Binary matrices, and their associated submatrices of 1s, play a central role in the study of random bipartite graphs and in core data mining problems such as frequent itemset mining (FIM). Motivated by these connections, this paper addresses several statistical questions regarding submatrices of 1s in a random binary matrix with independent Bernoulli entries. We establish a three-point concentration result, and a related probability bound, for the size of the largest square submatrix of 1s in a square Bernoulli matrix, and extend these results to non-square matrices and submatrices with ﬁxed aspect ratios. We then consider the noise sensitivity of frequent itemset mining under a simple binary additive noise model, and show that, even at small noise levels, large blocks of 1s leave behind fragments of only logarithmic size. As a result, standard FIM algorithms, which search only for submatrices of 1s, cannot directly recover such blocks when noise is present. On the positive side, we show that an error-tolerant frequent itemset criterion can recover a submatrix of 1s against a background of 0s plus noise, even when the size of the submatrix of 1s is very small. 1 Keywords: frequent itemset mining, bipartite graph, biclique, submatrix of 1s, statistical signiﬁcance</p><p>4 0.060396243 <a title="7-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2008-Learning_from_Multiple_Sources.html">52 jmlr-2008-Learning from Multiple Sources</a></p>
<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Michael Kearns, Jennifer Wortman</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning accurate models from multiple sources of “nearby” data. Given distinct samples from multiple data sources and estimates of the dissimilarities between these sources, we provide a general theory of which samples should be used to learn models for each source. This theory is applicable in a broad decision-theoretic learning framework, and yields general results for classiﬁcation and regression. A key component of our approach is the development of approximate triangle inequalities for expected loss, which may be of independent interest. We discuss the related problem of learning parameters of a distribution from multiple data sources. Finally, we illustrate our theory through a series of synthetic simulations.

<p>Author: Bo Jiang, Xuegong Zhang, Tianxi Cai</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most popular and promising classiﬁcation algorithms. After a classiﬁcation rule is constructed via the SVM, it is essential to evaluate its prediction accuracy. In this paper, we develop procedures for obtaining both point and interval estimators for the prediction error. Under mild regularity conditions, we derive the consistency and asymptotic normality of the prediction error estimators for SVM with ﬁnite-dimensional kernels. A perturbationresampling procedure is proposed to obtain interval estimates for the prediction error in practice. With numerical studies on simulated data and a benchmark repository, we recommend the use of interval estimates centered at the cross-validated point estimates for the prediction error. Further applications of the proposed procedure in model evaluation and feature selection are illustrated with two examples.

<p>Author: Liviu Panait, Karl Tuyls, Sean Luke</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents the dynamics of multiple learning agents from an evolutionary game theoretic perspective. We provide replicator dynamics models for cooperative coevolutionary algorithms and for traditional multiagent Q-learning, and we extend these differential equations to account for lenient learners: agents that forgive possible mismatched teammate actions that resulted in low rewards. We use these extended formal models to study the convergence guarantees for these algorithms, and also to visualize the basins of attraction to optimal and suboptimal solutions in two benchmark coordination problems. The paper demonstrates that lenience provides learners with more accurate information about the beneﬁts of performing their actions, resulting in higher likelihood of convergence to the globally optimal solution. In addition, the analysis indicates that the choice of learning algorithm has an insigniﬁcant impact on the overall performance of multiagent learning algorithms; rather, the performance of these algorithms depends primarily on the level of lenience that the agents exhibit to one another. Finally, the research herein supports the strength and generality of evolutionary game theory as a backbone for multiagent learning.

<p>Author: Glenn Shafer, Vladimir Vovk</p><p>Abstract: Conformal prediction uses past experience to determine precise levels of conÄ?Ĺš dence in new predictions. Given an error probability ĂŽÄž, together with a method that makes a prediction y of a label Ă&lsaquo;&dagger; y, it produces a set of labels, typically containing y, that also contains y with probability 1 Ă˘&circ;&rsquo; ĂŽÄž. Ă&lsaquo;&dagger; Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for producing y: a nearest-neighbor method, a Ă&lsaquo;&dagger; support-vector machine, ridge regression, etc. Conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted successively, each one being revealed before the next is predicted. The most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled independently from the same distribution, then the successive predictions will be right 1 Ă˘&circ;&rsquo; ĂŽÄž of the time, even though they are based on an accumulating data set rather than on independent data sets. In addition to the model under which successive examples are sampled independently, other on-line compression models can also use conformal prediction. The widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these. This tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of conformal prediction and works through several numerical examples. A more comprehensive treatment of the topic is provided in Algorithmic Learning in a Random World, by Vladimir Vovk, Alex Gammerman, and Glenn Shafer (Springer, 2005).

<p>Author: Onureena Banerjee, Laurent El Ghaoui, Alexandre d'Aspremont</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a Gaussian or binary distribution in such a way that the resulting undirected graphical model is sparse. Our approach is to solve a maximum likelihood problem with an added 1 -norm penalty term. The problem as formulated is convex but the memory requirements and complexity of existing interior point methods are prohibitive for problems with more than tens of nodes. We present two new algorithms for solving problems with at least a thousand nodes in the Gaussian case. Our ﬁrst algorithm uses block coordinate descent, and can be interpreted as recursive 1 -norm penalized regression. Our second algorithm, based on Nesterov’s ﬁrst order method, yields a complexity estimate with a better dependence on problem size than existing interior point methods. Using a log determinant relaxation of the log partition function (Wainwright and Jordan, 2006), we show that these same algorithms can be used to solve an approximate sparse maximum likelihood problem for the binary case. We test our algorithms on synthetic data, as well as on gene expression and senate voting records data.

<p>Author: FranĂ§ois Fleuret, Donald Geman</p><p>Abstract: Most discriminative techniques for detecting instances from object categories in still images consist of looping over a partition of a pose space with dedicated binary classiÄ?Ĺš ers. The efÄ?Ĺš ciency of this strategy for a complex pose, that is, for Ä?Ĺš ne-grained descriptions, can be assessed by measuring the effect of sample size and pose resolution on accuracy and computation. Two conclusions emerge: (1) fragmenting the training data, which is inevitable in dealing with high in-class variation, severely reduces accuracy; (2) the computational cost at high resolution is prohibitive due to visiting a massive pose partition. To overcome data-fragmentation we propose a novel framework centered on pose-indexed features which assign a response to a pair consisting of an image and a pose, and are designed to be stationary: the probability distribution of the response is always the same if an object is actually present. Such features allow for efÄ?Ĺš cient, one-shot learning of pose-speciÄ?Ĺš c classiÄ?Ĺš ers. To avoid expensive scene processing, we arrange these classiÄ?Ĺš ers in a hierarchy based on nested partitions of the pose; as in previous work on coarse-to-Ä?Ĺš ne search, this allows for efÄ?Ĺš cient processing. The hierarchy is then Ă˘&euro;?foldedĂ˘&euro;? for training: all the classiÄ?Ĺš ers at each level are derived from one base predictor learned from all the data. The hierarchy is Ă˘&euro;?unfoldedĂ˘&euro;? for testing: parsing a scene amounts to examining increasingly Ä?Ĺš ner object descriptions only when there is sufÄ?Ĺš cient evidence for coarser ones. In this way, the detection results are equivalent to an exhaustive search at high resolution. We illustrate these ideas by detecting and localizing cats in highly cluttered greyscale scenes.

<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Stephen Gould</p><p>Abstract: With the increased availability of data for complex domains, it is desirable to learn Bayesian network structures that are sufﬁciently expressive for generalization while at the same time allow for tractable inference. While the method of thin junction trees can, in principle, be used for this purpose, its fully greedy nature makes it prone to overﬁtting, particularly when data is scarce. In this work we present a novel method for learning Bayesian networks of bounded treewidth that employs global structure modiﬁcations and that is polynomial both in the size of the graph and the treewidth bound. At the heart of our method is a dynamic triangulation that we update in a way that facilitates the addition of chain structures that increase the bound on the model’s treewidth by at most one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our “treewidth-friendly” method on several real-life data sets and show that it is superior to the greedy approach as soon as the bound on the treewidth is nontrivial. Importantly, we also show that by making use of global operators, we are able to achieve better generalization even when learning Bayesian networks of unbounded treewidth.

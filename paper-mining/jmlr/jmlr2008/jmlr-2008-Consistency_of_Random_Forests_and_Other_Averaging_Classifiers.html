<p>Author: Shann-Ching Chen, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Robert F. Murphy</p><p>Abstract: In structured classiﬁcation problems, there is a direct conﬂict between expressive models and efﬁcient inference: while graphical models such as Markov random ﬁelds or factor graphs can represent arbitrary dependences among instance labels, the cost of inference via belief propagation in these models grows rapidly as the graph structure becomes more complicated. One important source of complexity in belief propagation is the need to marginalize large factors to compute messages. This operation takes time exponential in the number of variables in the factor, and can limit the expressiveness of the models we can use. In this paper, we study a new class of potential functions, which we call decomposable k-way potentials, and provide efﬁcient algorithms for computing messages from these potentials during belief propagation. We believe these new potentials provide a good balance between expressive power and efﬁcient inference in practical structured classiﬁcation problems. We discuss three instances of decomposable potentials: the associative Markov network potential, the nested junction tree, and a new type of potential which we call the voting potential. We use these potentials to classify images of protein subcellular location patterns in groups of cells. Classifying subcellular location patterns can help us answer many important questions in computational biology, including questions about how various treatments affect the synthesis and behavior of proteins and networks of proteins within a cell. Our new representation and algorithm lead to substantial improvements in both inference speed and classiﬁcation accuracy.

<p>Author: Hsuan-Tien Lin, Ling Li</p><p>Abstract: Ensemble learning algorithms such as boosting can achieve better performance by averaging over the predictions of some base hypotheses. Nevertheless, most existing algorithms are limited to combining only a ﬁnite number of hypotheses, and the generated ensemble is usually sparse. Thus, it is not clear whether we should construct an ensemble classiﬁer with a larger or even an inﬁnite number of hypotheses. In addition, constructing an inﬁnite ensemble itself is a challenging task. In this paper, we formulate an inﬁnite ensemble learning framework based on the support vector machine (SVM). The framework can output an inﬁnite and nonsparse ensemble through embedding inﬁnitely many hypotheses into an SVM kernel. We use the framework to derive two novel kernels, the stump kernel and the perceptron kernel. The stump kernel embodies inﬁnitely many decision stumps, and the perceptron kernel embodies inﬁnitely many perceptrons. We also show that the Laplacian radial basis function kernel embodies inﬁnitely many decision trees, and can thus be explained through inﬁnite ensemble learning. Experimental results show that SVM with these kernels is superior to boosting with the same base hypothesis set. In addition, SVM with the stump kernel or the perceptron kernel performs similarly to SVM with the Gaussian radial basis function kernel, but enjoys the beneﬁt of faster parameter selection. These properties make the novel kernels favorable choices in practice.

<p>Author: Amit Dhurandhar, Alin Dobra</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we use the methodology introduced by Dhurandhar and Dobra (2009) for analyzing the error of classiﬁers and the model selection measures, to analyze decision tree algorithms. The methodology consists of obtaining parametric expressions for the moments of the generalization error (GE) for the classiﬁcation model of interest, followed by plotting these expressions for interpretability. The major challenge in applying the methodology to decision trees, the main theme of this work, is customizing the generic expressions for the moments of GE to this particular classiﬁcation algorithm. The speciﬁc contributions we make in this paper are: (a) we primarily characterize a subclass of decision trees namely, Random decision trees, (b) we discuss how the analysis extends to other decision tree algorithms and (c) in order to extend the analysis to certain model selection measures, we generalize the relationships between the moments of GE and moments of the model selection measures given in (Dhurandhar and Dobra, 2009) to randomized classiﬁcation algorithms. An empirical comparison of the proposed method with Monte Carlo and distribution free bounds obtained using Breiman’s formula, depicts the advantages of the method in terms of running time and accuracy. It thus showcases the use of the deployed methodology as an exploratory tool to study learning algorithms.

<p>Author: Xing Sun, Andrew B. Nobel</p><p>Abstract: Binary matrices, and their associated submatrices of 1s, play a central role in the study of random bipartite graphs and in core data mining problems such as frequent itemset mining (FIM). Motivated by these connections, this paper addresses several statistical questions regarding submatrices of 1s in a random binary matrix with independent Bernoulli entries. We establish a three-point concentration result, and a related probability bound, for the size of the largest square submatrix of 1s in a square Bernoulli matrix, and extend these results to non-square matrices and submatrices with ﬁxed aspect ratios. We then consider the noise sensitivity of frequent itemset mining under a simple binary additive noise model, and show that, even at small noise levels, large blocks of 1s leave behind fragments of only logarithmic size. As a result, standard FIM algorithms, which search only for submatrices of 1s, cannot directly recover such blocks when noise is present. On the positive side, we show that an error-tolerant frequent itemset criterion can recover a submatrix of 1s against a background of 0s plus noise, even when the size of the submatrix of 1s is very small. 1 Keywords: frequent itemset mining, bipartite graph, biclique, submatrix of 1s, statistical signiﬁcance</p><p>6 0.1751297 <a title="25-lsi-6" href="./jmlr-2008-Regularization_on_Graphs_with_Function-adapted_Diffusion_Processes.html">81 jmlr-2008-Regularization on Graphs with Function-adapted Diffusion Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: Loog (2007) provided a complete characterization of the family of solutions to a generalized Fisher criterion. We show that this characterization is essentially equivalent to the original characterization proposed in Ye (2005). The computational advantage of the original characterization over the new one is discussed, which justiﬁes its practical use. Keywords: linear discriminant analysis, dimension reduction, linear transformation 1. Generalized Fisher Criterion For a given data set consisting of n data points {ai }n in IRd , a linear transformation G ∈ IRd× i=1 ( < d) maps each ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ n in the d-dimensional space to a vector ai in the -dimensional ˜ space as follows: G : ai ∈ IRd → ai = GT ai ∈ IR . ˜ Assume that there are k classes in the data set. The within-class scatter matrix S w , the betweenclass scatter matrix Sb , and the total scatter matrix St involved in linear discriminant analysis are deﬁned as follows (Fukunaga, 1990): k Sw = ∑ (Ai − ci eT )(Ai − ci eT )T , i=1 k Sb = ∑ ni (ci − c)(ci − c)T , i=1 k St = ∑ (Ai − ceT )(Ai − ceT )T , i=1 where Ai denotes the data matrix of the i-th class, ci = Ai e/ni is the centroid of the i-th class, ni is the sample size of the i-th class, c = Ae/n is the global centroid, and e is the vector of all ones with an appropriate length. It is easy to verify that St = Sb + Sw . In Ye (2005), the optimal transformation G is computed by maximizing a generalized Fisher criterion as follows: + G = arg max trace GT St G GT Sb G , (1) m× G∈IR c 2008 Jieping Ye. YE where M + denotes the pseudo-inverse (Golub and Van Loan, 1996) of M and it is introduced to overcome the singularity problem when dealing with high-dimensional low-sample-size data. 1.1 Equivalent Transformation Two linear transformations G1 and G2 can be considered equivalent if there is a vector v such that GT (ai − v) = GT (ai − v), for i = 1, · · · , n. Indeed, in this case, the difference between the projections 1 2 by G1 and G2 is a mere shift. Deﬁnition 1.1 For a given data set {a1 , · · · , an }, two transformations G1 and G2 are equivalent, if there is a vector v such that GT (ai − v) = GT (ai − v), for i = 1, · · · , n. 1 2 2. Characterization of Solutions to the Generalized Fisher Criterion Let St = UΣU T be the orthogonal eigendecomposition of St (note that St is symmetric and positive semi-deﬁnite), where U ∈ IRd×d is orthogonal and Σ ∈ IRd×d is diagonal with nonnegative diagonal entries sorted in nonincreasing order. Denote Σr as the r-th principal submatrix of Σ, where r = rank(St ). Partition U into two components as U = [U1 ,U2 ], where U1 ∈ IRd×r and U2 ∈ IRd×(d−r) . Note that r ≤ n, and for high-dimensional low-sample-size data, U1 is much smaller than U2 . In Loog (2007), a complete family of solutions S to the maximization problem in Eq. (1) is given as (We correct the error in Loog (2007) by using U instead of U T .) S= U ΛZ Y ∈ IRd× Z ∈ IR × is nonsingular , Y ∈ IR(n−r)× , where Λ ∈ IRr× maximizes the following objective function: F0 (X) = trace −1 X T Σr X T X T (U1 SbU1 )X . ˜ In Ye (2005), a family of solutions S is given as ˜ S= U ΛZ 0 ∈ IRd× Z ∈ IR × is nonsingular . The only difference between these two characterizations of solutions is the matrix Y in S , which is ˜ replaced by the zero matrix in S . We show in the next section the equivalence relationship between these two characterizations. 3. Equivalent Solution Characterizations ˜ Consider the following two transformations G1 and G2 from S and S respectively: G1 = U ΛZ Y ∈ S, G2 = U 518 ΛZ 0 ˜ ∈ S. O N THE C OMPLETE C HARACTERIZATION OF S OLUTIONS TO A G ENERALIZED F ISHER C RITERION Recall that U = [U1 ,U2 ], where the columns of U2 span the null space of St . Hence, n T T T 0 = U2 St U2 = ∑ U2 (ai − c) · (U2 (ai − c))T , i=1 T and U2 (ai − c) = 0, for i = 1, · · · , n, where c is the global centroid. It follows that T T T GT (ai − c) = Z T ΛT U1 (ai − c) +Y T U2 (ai − c) = Z T ΛT U1 (ai − c) = GT (ai − c), 1 2 for i = 1, · · · , n. That is, G1 and G2 are equivalent transformations. Hence, the two solution charac˜ terizations S and S are essentially equivalent. Remark 3.1 The analysis above shows that the additional information contained in S is the null ˜ space, U2 , of St , which leads to an equivalent transformation. In S , the null space U2 is removed, which can be further justiﬁed as follows. Since St = Sb + Sw , we have T T T 0 = U2 St U2 = U2 SbU2 +U2 SwU2 . T It follows that U2 SbU2 = 0, as both Sb and Sw are positive semi-deﬁnite. Thus, the null space U2 does not contain any discriminant information. This explains why the null space of St is removed in most discriminant analysis based algorithms proposed in the past. 4. Efﬁciency Comparison In S , the full matrix U is involved, whose computation may be expensive, especially for high˜ dimensional data. In contrast, only the ﬁrst component U1 ∈ IRd×r of U is involved in S , which can be computed efﬁciently for high-dimensional low-sample-size problem by directly working on the Gram matrix instead of the covariance matrix. ˜ In summary, we show that S and S are equivalent characterizations of the solutions to the generalized Fisher criterion in Eq. (1). However, the latter one is preferred in practice due to its relative efﬁciency for high-dimensional low-sample-size data. References K. Fukunaga.

<p>Author: David Mease, Abraham Wyner</p><p>Abstract: The statistical perspective on boosting algorithms focuses on optimization, drawing parallels with maximum likelihood estimation for logistic regression. In this paper we present empirical evidence that raises questions about this view. Although the statistical perspective provides a theoretical framework within which it is possible to derive theorems and create new algorithms in general contexts, we show that there remain many unanswered important questions. Furthermore, we provide examples that reveal crucial ﬂaws in the many practical suggestions and new methods that are derived from the statistical view. We perform carefully designed experiments using simple simulation models to illustrate some of these ﬂaws and their practical consequences.

<p>Author: Alexandre d'Aspremont, Francis Bach, Laurent El Ghaoui</p><p>Abstract: Given a sample covariance matrix, we examine the problem of maximizing the variance explained by a linear combination of the input variables while constraining the number of nonzero coefﬁcients in this combination. This is known as sparse principal component analysis and has a wide array of applications in machine learning and engineering. We formulate a new semideﬁnite relaxation to this problem and derive a greedy algorithm that computes a full set of good solutions for all target numbers of non zero coefﬁcients, with total complexity O(n3 ), where n is the number of variables. We then use the same relaxation to derive sufﬁcient conditions for global optimality of a solution, which can be tested in O(n3 ) per pattern. We discuss applications in subset selection and sparse recovery and show on artiﬁcial examples and biological data that our algorithm does provide globally optimal solutions in many cases.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: The linear model with sparsity-favouring prior on the coefﬁcients has important applications in many different domains. In machine learning, most methods to date search for maximum a posteriori sparse solutions and neglect to represent posterior uncertainties. In this paper, we address problems of Bayesian optimal design (or experiment planning), for which accurate estimates of uncertainty are essential. To this end, we employ expectation propagation approximate inference for the linear model with Laplace prior, giving new insight into numerical stability properties and proposing a robust algorithm. We also show how to estimate model hyperparameters by empirical Bayesian maximisation of the marginal likelihood, and propose ideas in order to scale up the method to very large underdetermined problems. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on the application of gene regulatory network identiﬁcation from micro-array expression data, where both the Laplace prior and the active experimental design approach are shown to result in signiﬁcant improvements. We also address the problem of sparse coding of natural images, and show how our framework can be used for compressive sensing tasks. Part of this work appeared in Seeger et al. (2007b).

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We propose a highly efﬁcient framework for penalized likelihood kernel methods applied to multiclass models with a large, structured set of classes. As opposed to many previous approaches which try to decompose the ﬁtting problem into many smaller ones, we focus on a Newton optimization of the complete model, making use of model structure and linear conjugate gradients in order to approximate Newton search directions. Crucially, our learning method is based entirely on matrix-vector multiplication primitives with the kernel matrices and their derivatives, allowing straightforward specialization to new kernels, and focusing code optimization efforts to these primitives only. Kernel parameters are learned automatically, by maximizing the cross-validation log likelihood in a gradient-based way, and predictive probabilities are estimated. We demonstrate our approach on large scale text classiﬁcation tasks with hierarchical structure on thousands of classes, achieving state-of-the-art results in an order of magnitude less time than previous work.

<p>Author: Suhrid Balakrishnan, David Madigan</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁers favoring sparse solutions, such as support vector machines, relevance vector machines, LASSO-regression based classiﬁers, etc., provide competitive methods for classiﬁcation problems in high dimensions. However, current algorithms for training sparse classiﬁers typically scale quite unfavorably with respect to the number of training examples. This paper proposes online and multipass algorithms for training sparse linear classiﬁers for high dimensional data. These algorithms have computational complexity and memory requirements that make learning on massive data sets feasible. The central idea that makes this possible is a straightforward quadratic approximation to the likelihood function.

<p>Author: Liviu Panait, Karl Tuyls, Sean Luke</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents the dynamics of multiple learning agents from an evolutionary game theoretic perspective. We provide replicator dynamics models for cooperative coevolutionary algorithms and for traditional multiagent Q-learning, and we extend these differential equations to account for lenient learners: agents that forgive possible mismatched teammate actions that resulted in low rewards. We use these extended formal models to study the convergence guarantees for these algorithms, and also to visualize the basins of attraction to optimal and suboptimal solutions in two benchmark coordination problems. The paper demonstrates that lenience provides learners with more accurate information about the beneﬁts of performing their actions, resulting in higher likelihood of convergence to the globally optimal solution. In addition, the analysis indicates that the choice of learning algorithm has an insigniﬁcant impact on the overall performance of multiagent learning algorithms; rather, the performance of these algorithms depends primarily on the level of lenience that the agents exhibit to one another. Finally, the research herein supports the strength and generality of evolutionary game theory as a backbone for multiagent learning.

Given an error probability ĂŽÄž, together with a method that makes a prediction y of a label Ă&lsaquo;&dagger; y, it produces a set of labels, typically containing y, that also contains y with probability 1 Ă˘&circ;&rsquo; ĂŽÄž. Ă&lsaquo;&dagger; Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for producing y: a nearest-neighbor method, a Ă&lsaquo;&dagger; support-vector machine, ridge regression, etc. Conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted successively, each one being revealed before the next is predicted. The most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled independently from the same distribution, then the successive predictions will be right 1 Ă˘&circ;&rsquo; ĂŽÄž of the time, even though they are based on an accumulating data set rather than on independent data sets. In addition to the model under which successive examples are sampled independently, other on-line compression models can also use conformal prediction. The widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these. This tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of conformal prediction and works through several numerical examples. A more comprehensive treatment of the topic is provided in Algorithmic Learning in a Random World, by Vladimir Vovk, Alex Gammerman, and Glenn Shafer (Springer, 2005).

<p>Author: Onureena Banerjee, Laurent El Ghaoui, Alexandre d'Aspremont</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a Gaussian or binary distribution in such a way that the resulting undirected graphical model is sparse. Our approach is to solve a maximum likelihood problem with an added 1 -norm penalty term. The problem as formulated is convex but the memory requirements and complexity of existing interior point methods are prohibitive for problems with more than tens of nodes. We present two new algorithms for solving problems with at least a thousand nodes in the Gaussian case. Our ﬁrst algorithm uses block coordinate descent, and can be interpreted as recursive 1 -norm penalized regression. Our second algorithm, based on Nesterov’s ﬁrst order method, yields a complexity estimate with a better dependence on problem size than existing interior point methods. Using a log determinant relaxation of the log partition function (Wainwright and Jordan, 2006), we show that these same algorithms can be used to solve an approximate sparse maximum likelihood problem for the binary case. We test our algorithms on synthetic data, as well as on gene expression and senate voting records data.

<p>Author: FranĂ§ois Fleuret, Donald Geman</p><p>Abstract: Most discriminative techniques for detecting instances from object categories in still images consist of looping over a partition of a pose space with dedicated binary classiÄ?Ĺš ers. The efÄ?Ĺš ciency of this strategy for a complex pose, that is, for Ä?Ĺš ne-grained descriptions, can be assessed by measuring the effect of sample size and pose resolution on accuracy and computation. Two conclusions emerge: (1) fragmenting the training data, which is inevitable in dealing with high in-class variation, severely reduces accuracy; (2) the computational cost at high resolution is prohibitive due to visiting a massive pose partition. To overcome data-fragmentation we propose a novel framework centered on pose-indexed features which assign a response to a pair consisting of an image and a pose, and are designed to be stationary: the probability distribution of the response is always the same if an object is actually present. Such features allow for efÄ?Ĺš cient, one-shot learning of pose-speciÄ?Ĺš c classiÄ?Ĺš ers. To avoid expensive scene processing, we arrange these classiÄ?Ĺš ers in a hierarchy based on nested partitions of the pose; as in previous work on coarse-to-Ä?Ĺš ne search, this allows for efÄ?Ĺš cient processing. The hierarchy is then Ă˘&euro;?foldedĂ˘&euro;? for training: all the classiÄ?Ĺš ers at each level are derived from one base predictor learned from all the data. The hierarchy is Ă˘&euro;?unfoldedĂ˘&euro;? for testing: parsing a scene amounts to examining increasingly Ä?Ĺš ner object descriptions only when there is sufÄ?Ĺš cient evidence for coarser ones. In this way, the detection results are equivalent to an exhaustive search at high resolution. We illustrate these ideas by detecting and localizing cats in highly cluttered greyscale scenes.

<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Stephen Gould</p><p>Abstract: With the increased availability of data for complex domains, it is desirable to learn Bayesian network structures that are sufﬁciently expressive for generalization while at the same time allow for tractable inference. While the method of thin junction trees can, in principle, be used for this purpose, its fully greedy nature makes it prone to overﬁtting, particularly when data is scarce. In this work we present a novel method for learning Bayesian networks of bounded treewidth that employs global structure modiﬁcations and that is polynomial both in the size of the graph and the treewidth bound. At the heart of our method is a dynamic triangulation that we update in a way that facilitates the addition of chain structures that increase the bound on the model’s treewidth by at most one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our “treewidth-friendly” method on several real-life data sets and show that it is superior to the greedy approach as soon as the bound on the treewidth is nontrivial. Importantly, we also show that by making use of global operators, we are able to achieve better generalization even when learning Bayesian networks of unbounded treewidth.

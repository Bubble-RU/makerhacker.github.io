<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Geremy Heitz, Gal Elidan, Pieter Abbeel, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning classiﬁers in structured domains, where some objects have a subset of features that are inherently absent due to complex relationships between the features. Unlike the case where a feature exists but its value is not observed, here we focus on the case where a feature may not even exist (structurally absent) for some of the samples. The common approach for handling missing features in discriminative models is to ﬁrst complete their unknown values, and then use a standard classiﬁcation procedure over the completed data. This paper focuses on features that are known to be non-existing, rather than have an unknown value. We show how incomplete data can be classiﬁed directly without any completion of the missing features using a max-margin learning framework. We formulate an objective function, based on the geometric interpretation of the margin, that aims to maximize the margin of each sample in its own relevant subspace. In this formulation, the linearly separable case can be transformed into a binary search over a series of second order cone programs (SOCP), a convex problem that can be solved efﬁciently. We also describe two approaches for optimizing the general case: an approximation that can be solved as a standard quadratic program (QP) and an iterative approach for solving the exact problem. By avoiding the pre-processing phase in which the data is completed, both of these approaches could offer considerable computational savings. More importantly, we show that the elegant handling of missing values by our approach allows it to both outperform other methods when the missing values have non-trivial structure, and be competitive with other methods when the values are missing at random. We demonstrate our results on several standard benchmarks and two real-world problems: edge prediction in metabolic pathways, and automobile detection in natural images.

<p>Author: Sungwook Yoon, Alan Fern, Robert Givan</p><p>Abstract: A number of today’s state-of-the-art planners are based on forward state-space search. The impressive performance can be attributed to progress in computing domain independent heuristics that perform well across many domains. However, it is easy to ﬁnd domains where such heuristics provide poor guidance, leading to planning failure. Motivated by such failures, the focus of this paper is to investigate mechanisms for learning domain-speciﬁc knowledge to better control forward search in a given domain. While there has been a large body of work on inductive learning of control knowledge for AI planning, there is a void of work aimed at forward-state-space search. One reason for this may be that it is challenging to specify a knowledge representation for compactly representing important concepts across a wide range of domains. One of the main contributions of this work is to introduce a novel feature space for representing such control knowledge. The key idea is to deﬁne features in terms of information computed via relaxed plan extraction, which has been a major source of success for non-learning planners. This gives a new way of leveraging relaxed planning techniques in the context of learning. Using this feature space, we describe three forms of control knowledge—reactive policies (decision list rules and measures of progress) and linear heuristics—and show how to learn them and incorporate them into forward state-space search. Our empirical results show that our approaches are able to surpass state-of-the-art nonlearning planners across a wide range of planning competition domains.

<p>Author: David C. Hoyle</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian inference from high-dimensional data involves the integration over a large number of model parameters. Accurate evaluation of such high-dimensional integrals raises a unique set of issues. These issues are illustrated using the exemplar of model selection for principal component analysis (PCA). A Bayesian model selection criterion, based on a Laplace approximation to the model evidence for determining the number of signal principal components present in a data set, has previously been show to perform well on various test data sets. Using simulated data we show that for d-dimensional data and small sample sizes, N, the accuracy of this model selection method is strongly affected by increasing values of d. By taking proper account of the contribution to the evidence from the large number of model parameters we show that model selection accuracy is substantially improved. The accuracy of the improved model evidence is studied in the asymptotic limit d → ∞ at ﬁxed ratio α = N/d, with α < 1. In this limit, model selection based upon the improved model evidence agrees with a frequentist hypothesis testing approach.

<p>Author: Ilya Shpitser, Judea Pearl</p><p>Abstract: We consider a hierarchy of queries about causal relationships in graphical models, where each level in the hierarchy requires more detailed information than the one below. The hierarchy consists of three levels: associative relationships, derived from a joint distribution over the observable variables; cause-effect relationships, derived from distributions resulting from external interventions; and counterfactuals, derived from distributions that span multiple “parallel worlds” and resulting from simultaneous, possibly conﬂicting observations and interventions. We completely characterize cases where a given causal query can be computed from information lower in the hierarchy, and provide algorithms that accomplish this computation. Speciﬁcally, we show when effects of interventions can be computed from observational studies, and when probabilities of counterfactuals can be computed from experimental studies. We also provide a graphical characterization of those queries which cannot be computed (by any method) from queries at a lower layer of the hierarchy.

<p>Author: Edoardo M. Airoldi, David M. Blei, Stephen E. Fienberg, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Consider data consisting of pairwise measurements, such as presence or absence of links between pairs of objects. These data arise, for instance, in the analysis of protein interactions and gene regulatory networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks. Analyzing pairwise measurements with probabilistic models requires special assumptions, since the usual independence or exchangeability assumptions no longer hold. Here we introduce a class of variance allocation models for pairwise measurements: mixed membership stochastic blockmodels. These models combine global parameters that instantiate dense patches of connectivity (blockmodel) with local parameters that instantiate node-speciﬁc variability in the connections (mixed membership). We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We demonstrate the advantages of mixed membership stochastic blockmodels with applications to social networks and protein interaction networks.

<p>Author: Ashwin Srinivasan, Ross D. King</p><p>Abstract: The use of computational models is increasingly expected to play an important role in predicting the behaviour of biological systems. Models are being sought at different scales of biological organisation namely: sub-cellular, cellular, tissue, organ, organism and ecosystem; with a view of identifying how different components are connected together, how they are controlled and how they behave when functioning as a system. Except for very simple biological processes, system identiﬁcation from ﬁrst principles can be extremely difﬁcult. This has brought into focus automated techniques for constructing models using data of system behaviour. Such techniques face three principal issues: (1) The model representation language must be rich enough to capture system behaviour; (2) The system identiﬁcation technique must be powerful enough to identify substantially complex models; and (3) There may not be sufﬁcient data to obtain both the model’s structure and precise estimates of all of its parameters. In this paper, we address these issues in the following ways: (1) Models are represented in an expressive subset of ﬁrst-order logic. Speciﬁcally, they are expressed as logic programs; (2) System identiﬁcation is done using techniques developed in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). This allows the identiﬁcation of ﬁrst-order logic models from data. Speciﬁcally, we employ an incremental approach in which increasingly complex models are constructed from simpler ones using snapshots of system behaviour; and (3) We restrict ourselves to “qualitative” models. These are non-parametric: thus, usually less data are required than for identifying parametric quantitative models. A further advantage is that the data need not be precise numerical observations (instead, they are abstractions like positive, negative, zero, increasing, decreasing and so on). We describe incremental construction of qualitative models using a simple physical system and demonstrate its application to identiﬁcatio</p><p>2 0.57012004 <a title="44-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2008-Support_Vector_Machinery_for_Infinite_Ensemble_Learning.html">89 jmlr-2008-Support Vector Machinery for Infinite Ensemble Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hsuan-Tien Lin, Ling Li</p><p>Abstract: Ensemble learning algorithms such as boosting can achieve better performance by averaging over the predictions of some base hypotheses. Nevertheless, most existing algorithms are limited to combining only a ﬁnite number of hypotheses, and the generated ensemble is usually sparse. Thus, it is not clear whether we should construct an ensemble classiﬁer with a larger or even an inﬁnite number of hypotheses. In addition, constructing an inﬁnite ensemble itself is a challenging task. In this paper, we formulate an inﬁnite ensemble learning framework based on the support vector machine (SVM). The framework can output an inﬁnite and nonsparse ensemble through embedding inﬁnitely many hypotheses into an SVM kernel. We use the framework to derive two novel kernels, the stump kernel and the perceptron kernel. The stump kernel embodies inﬁnitely many decision stumps, and the perceptron kernel embodies inﬁnitely many perceptrons. We also show that the Laplacian radial basis function kernel embodies inﬁnitely many decision trees, and can thus be explained through inﬁnite ensemble learning. Experimental results show that SVM with these kernels is superior to boosting with the same base hypothesis set. In addition, SVM with the stump kernel or the perceptron kernel performs similarly to SVM with the Gaussian radial basis function kernel, but enjoys the beneﬁt of faster parameter selection. These properties make the novel kernels favorable choices in practice.

<p>Author: David C. Hoyle</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian inference from high-dimensional data involves the integration over a large number of model parameters. Accurate evaluation of such high-dimensional integrals raises a unique set of issues. These issues are illustrated using the exemplar of model selection for principal component analysis (PCA). A Bayesian model selection criterion, based on a Laplace approximation to the model evidence for determining the number of signal principal components present in a data set, has previously been show to perform well on various test data sets. Using simulated data we show that for d-dimensional data and small sample sizes, N, the accuracy of this model selection method is strongly affected by increasing values of d. By taking proper account of the contribution to the evidence from the large number of model parameters we show that model selection accuracy is substantially improved. The accuracy of the improved model evidence is studied in the asymptotic limit d → ∞ at ﬁxed ratio α = N/d, with α < 1. In this limit, model selection based upon the improved model evidence agrees with a frequentist hypothesis testing approach.

<p>Author: Ilya Shpitser, Judea Pearl</p><p>Abstract: We consider a hierarchy of queries about causal relationships in graphical models, where each level in the hierarchy requires more detailed information than the one below. The hierarchy consists of three levels: associative relationships, derived from a joint distribution over the observable variables; cause-effect relationships, derived from distributions resulting from external interventions; and counterfactuals, derived from distributions that span multiple “parallel worlds” and resulting from simultaneous, possibly conﬂicting observations and interventions. We completely characterize cases where a given causal query can be computed from information lower in the hierarchy, and provide algorithms that accomplish this computation. Speciﬁcally, we show when effects of interventions can be computed from observational studies, and when probabilities of counterfactuals can be computed from experimental studies. We also provide a graphical characterization of those queries which cannot be computed (by any method) from queries at a lower layer of the hierarchy.

<p>Author: Jiji Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Causal reasoning is primarily concerned with what would happen to a system under external interventions. In particular, we are often interested in predicting the probability distribution of some random variables that would result if some other variables were forced to take certain values. One prominent approach to tackling this problem is based on causal Bayesian networks, using directed acyclic graphs as causal diagrams to relate post-intervention probabilities to pre-intervention probabilities that are estimable from observational data. However, such causal diagrams are seldom fully testable given observational data. In consequence, many causal discovery algorithms based on data-mining can only output an equivalence class of causal diagrams (rather than a single one). This paper is concerned with causal reasoning given an equivalence class of causal diagrams, represented by a (partial) ancestral graph. We present two main results. The ﬁrst result extends Pearl (1995)’s celebrated do-calculus to the context of ancestral graphs. In the second result, we focus on a key component of Pearl’s calculus—the property of invariance under interventions, and give stronger graphical conditions for this property than those implied by the ﬁrst result. The second result also improves the earlier, similar results due to Spirtes et al. (1993).

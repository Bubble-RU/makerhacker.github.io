<p>Author: Tianjiao Chu, Clark Glymour</p><p>Abstract: Pointwise consistent, feasible procedures for estimating contemporaneous linear causal structure from time series data have been developed using multiple conditional independence tests, but no such procedures are available for non-linear systems. We describe a feasible procedure for learning a class of non-linear time series structures, which we call additive non-linear time series. We show that for data generated from stationary models of this type, two classes of conditional independence relations among time series variables and their lags can be tested efﬁciently and consistently using tests based on additive model regression. Combining results of statistical tests for these two classes of conditional independence relations and the temporal structure of time series data, a new consistent model speciﬁcation procedure is able to extract relatively detailed causal information. We investigate the ﬁnite sample behavior of the procedure through simulation, and illustrate the application of this method through analysis of the possible causal connections among four ocean indices. Several variants of the procedure are also discussed.

<p>Author: Balázs Csanád Csáji, László Monostori</p><p>Abstract: The paper investigates the possibility of applying value function based reinforcement learning (RL) methods in cases when the environment may change over time. First, theorems are presented which show that the optimal value function of a discounted Markov decision process (MDP) Lipschitz continuously depends on the immediate-cost function and the transition-probability function. Dependence on the discount factor is also analyzed and shown to be non-Lipschitz. Afterwards, the concept of (ε, δ)-MDPs is introduced, which is a generalization of MDPs and ε-MDPs. In this model the environment may change over time, more precisely, the transition function and the cost function may vary from time to time, but the changes must be bounded in the limit. Then, learning algorithms in changing environments are analyzed. A general relaxed convergence theorem for stochastic iterative algorithms is presented. We also demonstrate the results through three classical RL methods: asynchronous value iteration, Q-learning and temporal difference learning. Finally, some numerical experiments concerning changing environments are presented.

<p>Author: Vojtěch Franc, Bogdan Savchynskyy</p><p>Abstract: The max-sum classiﬁer predicts n-tuple of labels from n-tuple of observable variables by maximizing a sum of quality functions deﬁned over neighbouring pairs of labels and observable variables. Predicting labels as MAP assignments of a Random Markov Field is a particular example of the max-sum classiﬁer. Learning parameters of the max-sum classiﬁer is a challenging problem because even computing the response of such classiﬁer is NP-complete in general. Estimating parameters using the Maximum Likelihood approach is feasible only for a subclass of max-sum classiﬁers with an acyclic structure of neighbouring pairs. Recently, the discriminative methods represented by the perceptron and the Support Vector Machines, originally designed for binary linear classiﬁers, have been extended for learning some subclasses of the max-sum classiﬁer. Besides the max-sum classiﬁers with the acyclic neighbouring structure, it has been shown that the discriminative learning is possible even with arbitrary neighbouring structure provided the quality functions fulﬁll some additional constraints. In this article, we extend the discriminative approach to other three classes of max-sum classiﬁers with an arbitrary neighbourhood structure. We derive learning algorithms for two subclasses of max-sum classiﬁers whose response can be computed in polynomial time: (i) the max-sum classiﬁers with supermodular quality functions and (ii) the max-sum classiﬁers whose response can be computed exactly by a linear programming relaxation. Moreover, we show that the learning problem can be approximately solved even for a general max-sum classiﬁer.

<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Zaiqing Nie, Bo Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen</p><p>Abstract: Existing template-independent web data extraction approaches adopt highly ineffective decoupled strategies—attempting to do data record detection and attribute labeling in two separate phases. In this paper, we propose an integrated web data extraction paradigm with hierarchical models. The proposed model is called Dynamic Hierarchical Markov Random Fields (DHMRFs). DHMRFs take structural uncertainty into consideration and deﬁne a joint distribution of both model structure and class labels. The joint distribution is an exponential family distribution. As a conditional model, DHMRFs relax the independence assumption as made in directed models. Since exact inference is intractable, a variational method is developed to learn the model’s parameters and to ﬁnd the MAP model structure and label assignments. We apply DHMRFs to a real-world web data extraction task. Experimental results show that: (1) integrated web data extraction models can achieve signiﬁcant improvements on both record detection and attribute labeling compared to decoupled models; (2) in diverse web data extraction DHMRFs can potentially address the blocky artifact issue which is suffered by ﬁxed-structured hierarchical models.

<p>Author: Glenn Shafer, Vladimir Vovk</p><p>Abstract: Conformal prediction uses past experience to determine precise levels of conÄ?Ĺš dence in new predictions. Given an error probability ĂŽÄž, together with a method that makes a prediction y of a label Ă&lsaquo;&dagger; y, it produces a set of labels, typically containing y, that also contains y with probability 1 Ă˘&circ;&rsquo; ĂŽÄž. Ă&lsaquo;&dagger; Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for producing y: a nearest-neighbor method, a Ă&lsaquo;&dagger; support-vector machine, ridge regression, etc. Conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted successively, each one being revealed before the next is predicted. The most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled independently from the same distribution, then the successive predictions will be right 1 Ă˘&circ;&rsquo; ĂŽÄž of the time, even though they are based on an accumulating data set rather than on independent data sets. In addition to the model under which successive examples are sampled independently, other on-line compression models can also use conformal prediction. The widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these. This tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of conformal prediction and works through several numerical examples. A more comprehensive treatment of the topic is provided in Algorithmic Learning in a Random World, by Vladimir Vovk, Alex Gammerman, and Glenn Shafer (Springer, 2005).

<p>Author: Jia Li, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: Web sites must forecast Web page views in order to plan computer resource allocation and estimate upcoming revenue and advertising growth. In this paper, we focus on extracting trends and seasonal patterns from page view series, two dominant factors in the variation of such series. We investigate the Holt-Winters procedure and a state space model for making relatively short-term prediction. It is found that Web page views exhibit strong impulsive changes occasionally. The impulses cause large prediction errors long after their occurrences. A method is developed to identify impulses and to alleviate their damage on prediction. We also develop a long-range trend and season extraction method, namely the Elastic Smooth Season Fitting (ESSF) algorithm, to compute scalable and smooth yearly seasons. ESSF derives the yearly season by minimizing the residual sum of squares under smoothness regularization, a quadratic optimization problem. It is shown that for longterm prediction, ESSF improves accuracy signiﬁcantly over other methods that ignore the yearly seasonality.

<p>Author: Arnak S. Dalalyan, Anatoly Juditsky, Vladimir Spokoiny</p><p>Abstract: The statistical problem of estimating the effective dimension-reduction (EDR) subspace in the multi-index regression model with deterministic design and additive noise is considered. A new procedure for recovering the directions of the EDR subspace is proposed. Many methods for estimating the EDR subspace perform principal component analysis on a family of vectors, say ˆ ˆ β1 , . . . , βL , nearly lying in the EDR subspace. This is in particular the case for the structure-adaptive approach proposed by Hristache et al. (2001a). In the present work, we propose to estimate the projector onto the EDR subspace by the solution to the optimization problem minimize ˆ ˆ max β (I − A)β =1,...,L subject to A ∈ Am∗ , where Am∗ is the set of all symmetric matrices with eigenvalues in [0, 1] and trace less than or equal √ to m∗ , with m∗ being the true structural dimension. Under mild assumptions, n-consistency of the proposed procedure is proved (up to a logarithmic factor) in the case when the structural dimension is not larger than 4. Moreover, the stochastic error of the estimator of the projector onto the EDR subspace is shown to depend on L logarithmically. This enables us to use a large number of vectors ˆ β for estimating the EDR subspace. The empirical behavior of the algorithm is studied through numerical simulations.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: The linear model with sparsity-favouring prior on the coefﬁcients has important applications in many different domains. In machine learning, most methods to date search for maximum a posteriori sparse solutions and neglect to represent posterior uncertainties. In this paper, we address problems of Bayesian optimal design (or experiment planning), for which accurate estimates of uncertainty are essential. To this end, we employ expectation propagation approximate inference for the linear model with Laplace prior, giving new insight into numerical stability properties and proposing a robust algorithm. We also show how to estimate model hyperparameters by empirical Bayesian maximisation of the marginal likelihood, and propose ideas in order to scale up the method to very large underdetermined problems. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on the application of gene regulatory network identiﬁcation from micro-array expression data, where both the Laplace prior and the active experimental design approach are shown to result in signiﬁcant improvements. We also address the problem of sparse coding of natural images, and show how our framework can be used for compressive sensing tasks. Part of this work appeared in Seeger et al. (2007b). The gene network identiﬁcation application appears in Steinke et al. (2007).

<p>Author: Alexandre d'Aspremont, Francis Bach, Laurent El Ghaoui</p><p>Abstract: Given a sample covariance matrix, we examine the problem of maximizing the variance explained by a linear combination of the input variables while constraining the number of nonzero coefﬁcients in this combination. This is known as sparse principal component analysis and has a wide array of applications in machine learning and engineering. We formulate a new semideﬁnite relaxation to this problem and derive a greedy algorithm that computes a full set of good solutions for all target numbers of non zero coefﬁcients, with total complexity O(n3 ), where n is the number of variables. We then use the same relaxation to derive sufﬁcient conditions for global optimality of a solution, which can be tested in O(n3 ) per pattern. We discuss applications in subset selection and sparse recovery and show on artiﬁcial examples and biological data that our algorithm does provide globally optimal solutions in many cases.

<p>Author: Jieping Ye, Shuiwang Ji, Jianhui Chen</p><p>Abstract: Regularized kernel discriminant analysis (RKDA) performs linear discriminant analysis in the feature space via the kernel trick. Its performance depends on the selection of kernels. In this paper, we consider the problem of multiple kernel learning (MKL) for RKDA, in which the optimal kernel matrix is obtained as a linear combination of pre-speciﬁed kernel matrices. We show that the kernel learning problem in RKDA can be formulated as convex programs. First, we show that this problem can be formulated as a semideﬁnite program (SDP). Based on the equivalence relationship between RKDA and least square problems in the binary-class case, we propose a convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) formulation for kernel learning in RKDA. A semi-inﬁnite linear programming (SILP) formulation is derived to further improve the efﬁciency. We extend these formulations to the multi-class case based on a key result established in this paper. That is, the multi-class RKDA kernel learning problem can be decomposed into a set of binary-class kernel learning problems which are constrained to share a common kernel. Based on this decomposition property, SDP formulations are proposed for the multi-class case. Furthermore, it leads naturally to QCQP and SILP formulations. As the performance of RKDA depends on the regularization parameter, we show that this parameter can also be optimized in a joint framework with the kernel. Extensive experiments have been conducted and analyzed, and connections to other algorithms are discussed.

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Andrea Caponnetto, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil, Yiming Ying</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces HK of functions from an input space into a Hilbert space Y , an environment appropriate for multi-task learning. The reproducing kernel K associated to HK has its values as operators on Y . Our primary goal here is to derive conditions which ensure that the kernel K is universal. This means that on every compact subset of the input space, every continuous function with values in Y can be uniformly approximated by sections of the kernel. We provide various characterizations of universal kernels and highlight them with several concrete examples of some practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles of functional analysis and especially the useful notion of vector measures which we describe in sufﬁcient detail to clarify our results.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We propose a highly efﬁcient framework for penalized likelihood kernel methods applied to multiclass models with a large, structured set of classes. As opposed to many previous approaches which try to decompose the ﬁtting problem into many smaller ones, we focus on a Newton optimization of the complete model, making use of model structure and linear conjugate gradients in order to approximate Newton search directions. Crucially, our learning method is based entirely on matrix-vector multiplication primitives with the kernel matrices and their derivatives, allowing straightforward specialization to new kernels, and focusing code optimization efforts to these primitives only. Kernel parameters are learned automatically, by maximizing the cross-validation log likelihood in a gradient-based way, and predictive probabilities are estimated. We demonstrate our approach on large scale text classiﬁcation tasks with hierarchical structure on thousands of classes, achieving state-of-the-art results in an order of magnitude less time than previous work.

<p>Author: Hsuan-Tien Lin, Ling Li</p><p>Abstract: Ensemble learning algorithms such as boosting can achieve better performance by averaging over the predictions of some base hypotheses. Nevertheless, most existing algorithms are limited to combining only a ﬁnite number of hypotheses, and the generated ensemble is usually sparse. Thus, it is not clear whether we should construct an ensemble classiﬁer with a larger or even an inﬁnite number of hypotheses. In addition, constructing an inﬁnite ensemble itself is a challenging task. In this paper, we formulate an inﬁnite ensemble learning framework based on the support vector machine (SVM). The framework can output an inﬁnite and nonsparse ensemble through embedding inﬁnitely many hypotheses into an SVM kernel. We use the framework to derive two novel kernels, the stump kernel and the perceptron kernel. The stump kernel embodies inﬁnitely many decision stumps, and the perceptron kernel embodies inﬁnitely many perceptrons. We also show that the Laplacian radial basis function kernel embodies inﬁnitely many decision trees, and can thus be explained through inﬁnite ensemble learning. Experimental results show that SVM with these kernels is superior to boosting with the same base hypothesis set. In addition, SVM with the stump kernel or the perceptron kernel performs similarly to SVM with the Gaussian radial basis function kernel, but enjoys the beneﬁt of faster parameter selection. These properties make the novel kernels favorable choices in practice.

<p>Author: Gerda Claeskens, Christophe Croux, Johan Van Kerckhoven</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines for classiﬁcation have the advantage that the curse of dimensionality is circumvented. It has been shown that a reduction of the dimension of the input space leads to even better results. For this purpose, we propose two information criteria which can be computed directly from the deﬁnition of the support vector machine. We assess the predictive performance of the models selected by our new criteria and compare them to existing variable selection techniques in a simulation study. The simulation results show that the new criteria are competitive in terms of generalization error rate while being much easier to compute. We arrive at the same ﬁndings for comparison on some real-world benchmark data sets.

<p>Author: Alain Rakotomamonjy, Francis R. Bach, Stéphane Canu, Yves Grandvalet</p><p>Abstract: Multiple kernel learning (MKL) aims at simultaneously learning a kernel and the associated predictor in supervised learning settings. For the support vector machine, an efﬁcient and general multiple kernel learning algorithm, based on semi-inﬁnite linear programming, has been recently proposed. This approach has opened new perspectives since it makes MKL tractable for large-scale problems, by iteratively using existing support vector machine code. However, it turns out that this iterative algorithm needs numerous iterations for converging towards a reasonable solution. In this paper, we address the MKL problem through a weighted 2-norm regularization formulation with an additional constraint on the weights that encourages sparse kernel combinations. Apart from learning the combination, we solve a standard SVM optimization problem, where the kernel is deﬁned as a linear combination of multiple kernels. We propose an algorithm, named SimpleMKL, for solving this MKL problem and provide a new insight on MKL algorithms based on mixed-norm regularization by showing that the two approaches are equivalent. We show how SimpleMKL can be applied beyond binary classiﬁcation, for problems like regression, clustering (one-class classiﬁcation) or multiclass classiﬁcation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm converges rapidly and that its efﬁciency compares favorably to other MKL algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of MKL for some regressors based on wavelet kernels and on some model selection problems related to multiclass classiﬁcation problems.

<p>Author: Jieping Ye, Shuiwang Ji, Jianhui Chen</p><p>Abstract: Regularized kernel discriminant analysis (RKDA) performs linear discriminant analysis in the feature space via the kernel trick. Its performance depends on the selection of kernels. In this paper, we consider the problem of multiple kernel learning (MKL) for RKDA, in which the optimal kernel matrix is obtained as a linear combination of pre-speciﬁed kernel matrices. We show that the kernel learning problem in RKDA can be formulated as convex programs. First, we show that this problem can be formulated as a semideﬁnite program (SDP). Based on the equivalence relationship between RKDA and least square problems in the binary-class case, we propose a convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) formulation for kernel learning in RKDA. A semi-inﬁnite linear programming (SILP) formulation is derived to further improve the efﬁciency. We extend these formulations to the multi-class case based on a key result established in this paper. That is, the multi-class RKDA kernel learning problem can be decomposed into a set of binary-class kernel learning problems which are constrained to share a common kernel. Based on this decomposition property, SDP formulations are proposed for the multi-class case. Furthermore, it leads naturally to QCQP and SILP formulations. As the performance of RKDA depends on the regularization parameter, we show that this parameter can also be optimized in a joint framework with the kernel. Extensive experiments have been conducted and analyzed, and connections to other algorithms are discussed.

<p>Author: Christian Igel, Verena Heidrich-Meisner, Tobias Glasmachers</p><p>Abstract: SHARK is an object-oriented library for the design of adaptive systems. It comprises methods for single- and multi-objective optimization (e.g., evolutionary and gradient-based algorithms) as well as kernel-based methods, neural networks, and other machine learning techniques. Keywords: machine learning software, neural networks, kernel-methods, evolutionary algorithms, optimization, multi-objective-optimization 1. Overview SHARK is a modular C++ library for the design and optimization of adaptive systems. It serves as a toolbox for real world applications and basic research in computational intelligence and machine learning. The library provides methods for single- and multi-objective optimization, in particular evolutionary and gradient-based algorithms, kernel-based learning methods, neural networks, and many other machine learning techniques. Its main design criteria are ﬂexibility and speed. Here we restrict the description of SHARK to its core components, albeit the library contains plenty of additional functionality. Further information can be obtained from the HTML documentation and tutorials. More than 60 illustrative example programs serve as starting points for using SHARK. 2. Basic Tools—Rng, Array, and LinAlg The library provides general auxiliary functions and data structures for the development of machine learning algorithms. The Rng module generates reproducible and platform independent sequences of pseudo random numbers, which can be drawn from 14 predeﬁned discrete and continuous parametric distributions. The Array class provides dynamical array templates of arbitrary type and dimension as well as basic operations acting on these templates. LinAlg implements linear algebra algorithms such as matrix inversion and singular value decomposition. 3. ReClaM—Regression and Classiﬁcation Methods The goal of the ReClaM module is to provide machine learning algorithms for supervised classiﬁcation and regression in a uniﬁed, modular framework. It is built like a construction kit, where the main building blocks are adaptive data processing models, error functions, and optimization c 2008 Christian Igel, Verena Heidrich-Meisner and Tobias Glasmachers.

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

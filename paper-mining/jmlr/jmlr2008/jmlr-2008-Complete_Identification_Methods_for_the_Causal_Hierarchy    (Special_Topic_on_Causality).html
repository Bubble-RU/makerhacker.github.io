<p>Author: Jiji Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Causal reasoning is primarily concerned with what would happen to a system under external interventions. In particular, we are often interested in predicting the probability distribution of some random variables that would result if some other variables were forced to take certain values. One prominent approach to tackling this problem is based on causal Bayesian networks, using directed acyclic graphs as causal diagrams to relate post-intervention probabilities to pre-intervention probabilities that are estimable from observational data. However, such causal diagrams are seldom fully testable given observational data. In consequence, many causal discovery algorithms based on data-mining can only output an equivalence class of causal diagrams (rather than a single one). This paper is concerned with causal reasoning given an equivalence class of causal diagrams, represented by a (partial) ancestral graph. We present two main results. The ﬁrst result extends Pearl (1995)’s celebrated do-calculus to the context of ancestral graphs. In the second result, we focus on a key component of Pearl’s calculus—the property of invariance under interventions, and give stronger graphical conditions for this property than those implied by the ﬁrst result. The second result also improves the earlier, similar results due to Spirtes et al. (1993).

<p>Author: Jean-Philippe Pellet, André Elisseeff</p><p>Abstract: We show how a generic feature-selection algorithm returning strongly relevant variables can be turned into a causal structure-learning algorithm. We prove this under the Faithfulness assumption for the data distribution. In a causal graph, the strongly relevant variables for a node X are its parents, children, and children’s parents (or spouses), also known as the Markov blanket of X. Identifying the spouses leads to the detection of the V-structure patterns and thus to causal orientations. Repeating the task for all variables yields a valid partially oriented causal graph. We ﬁrst show an efﬁcient way to identify the spouse links. We then perform several experiments in the continuous domain using the Recursive Feature Elimination feature-selection algorithm with Support Vector Regression and empirically verify the intuition of this direct (but computationally expensive) approach. Within the same framework, we then devise a fast and consistent algorithm, Total Conditioning (TC), and a variant, TCbw , with an explicit backward feature-selection heuristics, for Gaussian data. After running a series of comparative experiments on ﬁve artiﬁcial networks, we argue that Markov blanket algorithms such as TC/TCbw or Grow-Shrink scale better than the reference PC algorithm and provides higher structural accuracy.

<p>Author: Yang-Bo He, Zhi Geng</p><p>Abstract: The causal discovery from data is important for various scientiﬁc investigations. Because we cannot distinguish the different directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in a Markov equivalence class learned from observational data, we have to collect further information on causal structures from experiments with external interventions. In this paper, we propose an active learning approach for discovering causal structures in which we ﬁrst ﬁnd a Markov equivalence class from observational data, and then we orient undirected edges in every chain component via intervention experiments separately. In the experiments, some variables are manipulated through external interventions. We discuss two kinds of intervention experiments, randomized experiment and quasi-experiment. Furthermore, we give two optimal designs of experiments, a batch-intervention design and a sequential-intervention design, to minimize the number of manipulated variables and the set of candidate structures based on the minimax and the maximum entropy criteria. We show theoretically that structural learning can be done locally in subgraphs of chain components without need of checking illegal v-structures and cycles in the whole network and that a Markov equivalence subclass obtained after each intervention can still be depicted as a chain graph.

<p>Author: Zongming Ma, Xianchao Xie, Zhi Geng</p><p>Abstract: Chain graphs present a broad class of graphical models for description of conditional independence structures, including both Markov networks and Bayesian networks as special cases. In this paper, we propose a computationally feasible method for the structural learning of chain graphs based on the idea of decomposing the learning problem into a set of smaller scale problems on its decomposed subgraphs. The decomposition requires conditional independencies but does not require the separators to be complete subgraphs. Algorithms for both skeleton recovery and complex arrow orientation are presented. Simulations under a variety of settings demonstrate the competitive performance of our method, especially when the underlying graph is sparse.

<p>Author: Tianjiao Chu, Clark Glymour</p><p>Abstract: Pointwise consistent, feasible procedures for estimating contemporaneous linear causal structure from time series data have been developed using multiple conditional independence tests, but no such procedures are available for non-linear systems. We describe a feasible procedure for learning a class of non-linear time series structures, which we call additive non-linear time series. We show that for data generated from stationary models of this type, two classes of conditional independence relations among time series variables and their lags can be tested efﬁciently and consistently using tests based on additive model regression. Combining results of statistical tests for these two classes of conditional independence relations and the temporal structure of time series data, a new consistent model speciﬁcation procedure is able to extract relatively detailed causal information. We investigate the ﬁnite sample behavior of the procedure through simulation, and illustrate the application of this method through analysis of the possible causal connections among four ocean indices. Several variants of the procedure are also discussed.

<p>Author: Leonor Becerra-Bonache, Colin de la Higuera, Jean-Christophe Janodet, Frédéric Tantini</p><p>Abstract: When facing the question of learning languages in realistic settings, one has to tackle several problems that do not admit simple solutions. On the one hand, languages are usually deﬁned by complex grammatical mechanisms for which the learning results are predominantly negative, as the few algorithms are not really able to cope with noise. On the other hand, the learning settings themselves rely either on too simple information (text) or on unattainable one (query systems that do not exist in practice, nor can be simulated). We consider simple but sound classes of languages deﬁned via the widely used edit distance: the balls of strings. We propose to learn them with the help of a new sort of queries, called the correction queries: when a string is submitted to the Oracle, either she accepts it if it belongs to the target language, or she proposes a correction, that is, a string of the language close to the query with respect to the edit distance. We show that even if the good balls are not learnable in Angluin’s M AT model, they can be learned from a polynomial number of correction queries. Moreover, experimental evidence simulating a human Expert shows that this algorithm is resistant to approximate answers.

<p>Author: Arthur D. Szlam, Mauro Maggioni, Ronald R. Coifman</p><p>Abstract: Harmonic analysis and diffusion on discrete data has been shown to lead to state-of-the-art algorithms for machine learning tasks, especially in the context of semi-supervised and transductive learning. The success of these algorithms rests on the assumption that the function(s) to be studied (learned, interpolated, etc.) are smooth with respect to the geometry of the data. In this paper we present a method for modifying the given geometry so the function(s) to be studied are smoother with respect to the modiﬁed geometry, and thus more amenable to treatment using harmonic analysis methods. Among the many possible applications, we consider the problems of image denoising and transductive classiﬁcation. In both settings, our approach improves on standard diffusion based methods.

<p>Author: Ilya Shpitser, Judea Pearl</p><p>Abstract: We consider a hierarchy of queries about causal relationships in graphical models, where each level in the hierarchy requires more detailed information than the one below. The hierarchy consists of three levels: associative relationships, derived from a joint distribution over the observable variables; cause-effect relationships, derived from distributions resulting from external interventions; and counterfactuals, derived from distributions that span multiple “parallel worlds” and resulting from simultaneous, possibly conﬂicting observations and interventions. We completely characterize cases where a given causal query can be computed from information lower in the hierarchy, and provide algorithms that accomplish this computation. Speciﬁcally, we show when effects of interventions can be computed from observational studies, and when probabilities of counterfactuals can be computed from experimental studies. We also provide a graphical characterization of those queries which cannot be computed (by any method) from queries at a lower layer of the hierarchy.

<p>Author: Andreas Christmann, Arnout Van Messem</p><p>Abstract: We investigate robustness properties for a broad class of support vector machines with non-smooth loss functions. These kernel methods are inspired by convex risk minimization in inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Leading examples are the support vector machine based on the ε-insensitive loss function, and kernel based quantile regression based on the pinball loss function. Firstly, we propose with the Bouligand inﬂuence function (BIF) a modiﬁcation of F.R. Hampel’s inﬂuence function. The BIF has the advantage of being positive homogeneous which is in general not true for Hampel’s inﬂuence function. Secondly, we show that many support vector machines based on a Lipschitz continuous loss function and a bounded kernel have a bounded BIF and are thus robust in the sense of robust statistics based on inﬂuence functions.

<p>Author: Jiji Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Causal reasoning is primarily concerned with what would happen to a system under external interventions. In particular, we are often interested in predicting the probability distribution of some random variables that would result if some other variables were forced to take certain values. One prominent approach to tackling this problem is based on causal Bayesian networks, using directed acyclic graphs as causal diagrams to relate post-intervention probabilities to pre-intervention probabilities that are estimable from observational data. However, such causal diagrams are seldom fully testable given observational data. In consequence, many causal discovery algorithms based on data-mining can only output an equivalence class of causal diagrams (rather than a single one). This paper is concerned with causal reasoning given an equivalence class of causal diagrams, represented by a (partial) ancestral graph. We present two main results. The ﬁrst result extends Pearl (1995)’s celebrated do-calculus to the context of ancestral graphs. In the second result, we focus on a key component of Pearl’s calculus—the property of invariance under interventions, and give stronger graphical conditions for this property than those implied by the ﬁrst result. The second result also improves the earlier, similar results due to Spirtes et al. (1993).

<p>Author: Leonor Becerra-Bonache, Colin de la Higuera, Jean-Christophe Janodet, Frédéric Tantini</p><p>Abstract: When facing the question of learning languages in realistic settings, one has to tackle several problems that do not admit simple solutions. On the one hand, languages are usually deﬁned by complex grammatical mechanisms for which the learning results are predominantly negative, as the few algorithms are not really able to cope with noise. On the other hand, the learning settings themselves rely either on too simple information (text) or on unattainable one (query systems that do not exist in practice, nor can be simulated). We consider simple but sound classes of languages deﬁned via the widely used edit distance: the balls of strings. We propose to learn them with the help of a new sort of queries, called the correction queries: when a string is submitted to the Oracle, either she accepts it if it belongs to the target language, or she proposes a correction, that is, a string of the language close to the query with respect to the edit distance. We show that even if the good balls are not learnable in Angluin’s M AT model, they can be learned from a polynomial number of correction queries. Moreover, experimental evidence simulating a human Expert shows that this algorithm is resistant to approximate answers.

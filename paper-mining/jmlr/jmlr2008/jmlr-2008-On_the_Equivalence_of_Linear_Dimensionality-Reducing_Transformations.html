<p>Author: Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: Loog (2007) provided a complete characterization of the family of solutions to a generalized Fisher criterion. We show that this characterization is essentially equivalent to the original characterization proposed in Ye (2005). The computational advantage of the original characterization over the new one is discussed, which justiﬁes its practical use. Keywords: linear discriminant analysis, dimension reduction, linear transformation 1. Generalized Fisher Criterion For a given data set consisting of n data points {ai }n in IRd , a linear transformation G ∈ IRd× i=1 ( < d) maps each ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ n in the d-dimensional space to a vector ai in the -dimensional ˜ space as follows: G : ai ∈ IRd → ai = GT ai ∈ IR . ˜ Assume that there are k classes in the data set. The within-class scatter matrix S w , the betweenclass scatter matrix Sb , and the total scatter matrix St involved in linear discriminant analysis are deﬁned as follows (Fukunaga, 1990): k Sw = ∑ (Ai − ci eT )(Ai − ci eT )T , i=1 k Sb = ∑ ni (ci − c)(ci − c)T , i=1 k St = ∑ (Ai − ceT )(Ai − ceT )T , i=1 where Ai denotes the data matrix of the i-th class, ci = Ai e/ni is the centroid of the i-th class, ni is the sample size of the i-th class, c = Ae/n is the global centroid, and e is the vector of all ones with an appropriate length. It is easy to verify that St = Sb + Sw . In Ye (2005), the optimal transformation G is computed by maximizing a generalized Fisher criterion as follows: + G = arg max trace GT St G GT Sb G , (1) m× G∈IR c 2008 Jieping Ye. YE where M + denotes the pseudo-inverse (Golub and Van Loan, 1996) of M and it is introduced to overcome the singularity problem when dealing with high-dimensional low-sample-size data. 1.1 Equivalent Transformation Two linear transformations G1 and G2 can be considered equivalent if there is a vector v such that GT (ai − v) = GT (ai − v), for i = 1, · · · , n. Indeed, in this case, the difference between the projections 1 2 by G1 and G2 is a mere shift. Deﬁnition 1.1 For a given data set {a1 , · · · , an }, two transformations G1 and G2 are equivalent, if there is a vector v such that GT (ai − v) = GT (ai − v), for i = 1, · · · , n. 1 2 2. Characterization of Solutions to the Generalized Fisher Criterion Let St = UΣU T be the orthogonal eigendecomposition of St (note that St is symmetric and positive semi-deﬁnite), where U ∈ IRd×d is orthogonal and Σ ∈ IRd×d is diagonal with nonnegative diagonal entries sorted in nonincreasing order. Denote Σr as the r-th principal submatrix of Σ, where r = rank(St ). Partition U into two components as U = [U1 ,U2 ], where U1 ∈ IRd×r and U2 ∈ IRd×(d−r) . Note that r ≤ n, and for high-dimensional low-sample-size data, U1 is much smaller than U2 . In Loog (2007), a complete family of solutions S to the maximization problem in Eq. (1) is given as (We correct the error in Loog (2007) by using U instead of U T .) S= U ΛZ Y ∈ IRd× Z ∈ IR × is nonsingular , Y ∈ IR(n−r)× , where Λ ∈ IRr× maximizes the following objective function: F0 (X) = trace −1 X T Σr X T X T (U1 SbU1 )X . ˜ In Ye (2005), a family of solutions S is given as ˜ S= U ΛZ 0 ∈ IRd× Z ∈ IR × is nonsingular . The only difference between these two characterizations of solutions is the matrix Y in S , which is ˜ replaced by the zero matrix in S . We show in the next section the equivalence relationship between these two characterizations. 3. Equivalent Solution Characterizations ˜ Consider the following two transformations G1 and G2 from S and S respectively: G1 = U ΛZ Y ∈ S, G2 = U 518 ΛZ 0 ˜ ∈ S. O N THE C OMPLETE C HARACTERIZATION OF S OLUTIONS TO A G ENERALIZED F ISHER C RITERION Recall that U = [U1 ,U2 ], where the columns of U2 span the null space of St . Hence, n T T T 0 = U2 St U2 = ∑ U2 (ai − c) · (U2 (ai − c))T , i=1 T and U2 (ai − c) = 0, for i = 1, · · · , n, where c is the global centroid. It follows that T T T GT (ai − c) = Z T ΛT U1 (ai − c) +Y T U2 (ai − c) = Z T ΛT U1 (ai − c) = GT (ai − c), 1 2 for i = 1, · · · , n. That is, G1 and G2 are equivalent transformations. Hence, the two solution charac˜ terizations S and S are essentially equivalent. Remark 3.1 The analysis above shows that the additional information contained in S is the null ˜ space, U2 , of St , which leads to an equivalent transformation. In S , the null space U2 is removed, which can be further justiﬁed as follows. Since St = Sb + Sw , we have T T T 0 = U2 St U2 = U2 SbU2 +U2 SwU2 . T It follows that U2 SbU2 = 0, as both Sb and Sw are positive semi-deﬁnite. Thus, the null space U2 does not contain any discriminant information. This explains why the null space of St is removed in most discriminant analysis based algorithms proposed in the past. 4. Efﬁciency Comparison In S , the full matrix U is involved, whose computation may be expensive, especially for high˜ dimensional data. In contrast, only the ﬁrst component U1 ∈ IRd×r of U is involved in S , which can be computed efﬁciently for high-dimensional low-sample-size problem by directly working on the Gram matrix instead of the covariance matrix. ˜ In summary, we show that S and S are equivalent characterizations of the solutions to the generalized Fisher criterion in Eq. (1). However, the latter one is preferred in practice due to its relative efﬁciency for high-dimensional low-sample-size data. References K. Fukunaga.

<p>Author: Arnak S. Dalalyan, Anatoly Juditsky, Vladimir Spokoiny</p><p>Abstract: The statistical problem of estimating the effective dimension-reduction (EDR) subspace in the multi-index regression model with deterministic design and additive noise is considered. A new procedure for recovering the directions of the EDR subspace is proposed. Many methods for estimating the EDR subspace perform principal component analysis on a family of vectors, say ˆ ˆ β1 , . . . , βL , nearly lying in the EDR subspace. This is in particular the case for the structure-adaptive approach proposed by Hristache et al. (2001a). In the present work, we propose to estimate the projector onto the EDR subspace by the solution to the optimization problem minimize ˆ ˆ max β (I − A)β =1,...,L subject to A ∈ Am∗ , where Am∗ is the set of all symmetric matrices with eigenvalues in [0, 1] and trace less than or equal √ to m∗ , with m∗ being the true structural dimension. Under mild assumptions, n-consistency of the proposed procedure is proved (up to a logarithmic factor) in the case when the structural dimension is not larger than 4. Moreover, the stochastic error of the estimator of the projector onto the EDR subspace is shown to depend on L logarithmically. This enables us to use a large number of vectors ˆ β for estimating the EDR subspace. The empirical behavior of the algorithm is studied through numerical simulations.

<p>Author: Andreas Maurer</p><p>Abstract: A method is introduced to learn and represent similarity with linear operators in kernel induced Hilbert spaces. Transferring error bounds for vector valued large-margin classiﬁers to the setting of Hilbert-Schmidt operators leads to dimension free bounds on a risk functional for linear representations and motivates a regularized objective functional. Minimization of this objective is effected by a simple technique of stochastic gradient descent. The resulting representations are tested on transfer problems in image processing, involving plane and spatial geometric invariants, handwritten characters and face recognition.

<p>Author: Manfred K. Warmuth, Dima Kuzmin</p><p>Abstract: We design an online algorithm for Principal Component Analysis. In each trial the current instance is centered and projected into a probabilistically chosen low dimensional subspace. The regret of our online algorithm, that is, the total expected quadratic compression loss of the online algorithm minus the total quadratic compression loss of the batch algorithm, is bounded by a term whose dependence on the dimension of the instances is only logarithmic. We ﬁrst develop our methodology in the expert setting of online learning by giving an algorithm for learning as well as the best subset of experts of a certain size. This algorithm is then lifted to the matrix setting where the subsets of experts correspond to subspaces. The algorithm represents the uncertainty over the best subspace as a density matrix whose eigenvalues are bounded. The running time is O(n2 ) per trial, where n is the dimension of the instances.

Generalized Fisher Criterion For a given data set consisting of n data points {ai }n in IRd , a linear transformation G ∈ IRd× i=1 ( < d) maps each ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ n in the d-dimensional space to a vector ai in the -dimensional ˜ space as follows: G : ai ∈ IRd → ai = GT ai ∈ IR . ˜ Assume that there are k classes in the data set. The within-class scatter matrix S w , the betweenclass scatter matrix Sb , and the total scatter matrix St involved in linear discriminant analysis are deﬁned as follows (Fukunaga, 1990): k Sw = ∑ (Ai − ci eT )(Ai − ci eT )T , i=1 k Sb = ∑ ni (ci − c)(ci − c)T , i=1 k St = ∑ (Ai − ceT )(Ai − ceT )T , i=1 where Ai denotes the data matrix of the i-th class, ci = Ai e/ni is the centroid of the i-th class, ni is the sample size of the i-th class, c = Ae/n is the global centroid, and e is the vector of all ones with an appropriate length.

Indeed, in this case, the difference between the projections 1 2 by G1 and G2 is a mere shift. Deﬁnition 1.1 For a given data set {a1 , · · · , an }, two transformations G1 and G2 are equivalent, if there is a vector v such that GT (ai − v) = GT (ai − v), for i = 1, · · · , n. 1 2 2. Characterization of Solutions to the Generalized Fisher Criterion Let St = UΣU T be the orthogonal eigendecomposition of St (note that St is symmetric and positive semi-deﬁnite), where U ∈ IRd×d is orthogonal and Σ ∈ IRd×d is diagonal with nonnegative diagonal entries sorted in nonincreasing order. Denote Σr as the r-th principal submatrix of Σ, where r = rank(St ). Partition U into two components as U = [U1 ,U2 ], where U1 ∈ IRd×r and U2 ∈ IRd×(d−r) . Note that r ≤ n, and for high-dimensional low-sample-size data, U1 is much smaller than U2 . In Loog (2007), a complete family of solutions S to the maximization problem in Eq. (1) is given as (We correct the error in Loog (2007) by using U instead of U T .) S= U ΛZ Y ∈ IRd× Z ∈ IR × is nonsingular , Y ∈ IR(n−r)× , where Λ ∈ IRr× maximizes the following objective function: F0 (X) = trace −1 X T Σr X T X T (U1 SbU1 )X . ˜ In Ye (2005), a family of solutions S is given as ˜ S= U ΛZ 0 ∈ IRd× Z ∈ IR × is nonsingular . The only difference between these two characterizations of solutions is the matrix Y in S , which is ˜ replaced by the zero matrix in S . We show in the next section the equivalence relationship between these two characterizations. 3. Equivalent Solution Characterizations ˜ Consider the following two transformations G1 and G2 from S and S respectively: G1 = U ΛZ Y ∈ S, G2 = U 518 ΛZ 0 ˜ ∈ S. O N THE C OMPLETE C HARACTERIZATION OF S OLUTIONS TO A G ENERALIZED F ISHER C RITERION Recall that U = [U1 ,U2 ], where the columns of U2 span the null space of St . Hence, n T T T 0 = U2 St U2 = ∑ U2 (ai − c) · (U2 (ai − c))T , i=1 T and U2 (ai − c) = 0, for i = 1, · · · , n, where c is the global centroid. It follows that T T T GT (ai − c) = Z T ΛT U1 (ai − c) +Y T U2 (ai − c) = Z T ΛT U1 (ai − c) = GT (ai − c), 1 2 for i = 1, · · · , n. That is, G1 and G2 are equivalent transformations. Hence, the two solution charac˜ terizations S and S are essentially equivalent. Remark 3.1 The analysis above shows that the additional information contained in S is the null ˜ space, U2 , of St , which leads to an equivalent transformation. In S , the null space U2 is removed, which can be further justiﬁed as follows. Since St = Sb + Sw , we have T T T 0 = U2 St U2 = U2 SbU2 +U2 SwU2 . T It follows that U2 SbU2 = 0, as both Sb and Sw are positive semi-deﬁnite. Thus, the null space U2 does not contain any discriminant information. This explains why the null space of St is removed in most discriminant analysis based algorithms proposed in the past. 4. Efﬁciency Comparison In S , the full matrix U is involved, whose computation may be expensive, especially for high˜ dimensional data. In contrast, only the ﬁrst component U1 ∈ IRd×r of U is involved in S , which can be computed efﬁciently for high-dimensional low-sample-size problem by directly working on the Gram matrix instead of the covariance matrix. ˜ In summary, we show that S and S are equivalent characterizations of the solutions to the generalized Fisher criterion in Eq. (1). However, the latter one is preferred in practice due to its relative efﬁciency for high-dimensional low-sample-size data. References K. Fukunaga.

In the present work, we propose to estimate the projector onto the EDR subspace by the solution to the optimization problem minimize ˆ ˆ max β (I − A)β =1,...,L subject to A ∈ Am∗ , where Am∗ is the set of all symmetric matrices with eigenvalues in [0, 1] and trace less than or equal √ to m∗ , with m∗ being the true structural dimension. Under mild assumptions, n-consistency of the proposed procedure is proved (up to a logarithmic factor) in the case when the structural dimension is not larger than 4. Moreover, the stochastic error of the estimator of the projector onto the EDR subspace is shown to depend on L logarithmically. This enables us to use a large number of vectors ˆ β for estimating the EDR subspace. The empirical behavior of the algorithm is studied through numerical simulations.

<p>Author: Andreas Maurer</p><p>Abstract: A method is introduced to learn and represent similarity with linear operators in kernel induced Hilbert spaces. Transferring error bounds for vector valued large-margin classiﬁers to the setting of Hilbert-Schmidt operators leads to dimension free bounds on a risk functional for linear representations and motivates a regularized objective functional. Minimization of this objective is effected by a simple technique of stochastic gradient descent. The resulting representations are tested on transfer problems in image processing, involving plane and spatial geometric invariants, handwritten characters and face recognition.

<p>Author: Gemma C. Garriga, Petra Kralj, Nada Lavrač</p><p>Abstract: Closed sets have been proven successful in the context of compacted data representation for association rule learning. However, their use is mainly descriptive, dealing only with unlabeled data. This paper shows that when considering labeled data, closed sets can be adapted for classiﬁcation and discrimination purposes by conveniently contrasting covering properties on positive and negative examples. We formally prove that these sets characterize the space of relevant combinations of features for discriminating the target class. In practice, identifying relevant/irrelevant combinations of features through closed sets is useful in many applications: to compact emerging patterns of typical descriptive mining applications, to reduce the number of essential rules in classiﬁcation, and to efﬁciently learn subgroup descriptions, as demonstrated in real-life subgroup discovery experiments on a high dimensional microarray data set.

<p>Author: Gérard Biau, Luc Devroye, Gábor Lugosi</p><p>Abstract: In the last years of his life, Leo Breiman promoted random forests for use in classiﬁcation. He suggested using averaging as a means of obtaining good discrimination rules. The base classiﬁers used for averaging are simple and randomized, often based on random samples from the data. He left a few questions unanswered regarding the consistency of such rules. In this paper, we give a number of theorems that establish the universal consistency of averaging rules. We also show that some popular classiﬁers, including one suggested by Breiman, are not universally consistent.

<p>Author: Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: Loog (2007) provided a complete characterization of the family of solutions to a generalized Fisher criterion. We show that this characterization is essentially equivalent to the original characterization proposed in Ye (2005). The computational advantage of the original characterization over the new one is discussed, which justiﬁes its practical use. Keywords: linear discriminant analysis, dimension reduction, linear transformation 1. Generalized Fisher Criterion For a given data set consisting of n data points {ai }n in IRd , a linear transformation G ∈ IRd× i=1 ( < d) maps each ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ n in the d-dimensional space to a vector ai in the -dimensional ˜ space as follows: G : ai ∈ IRd → ai = GT ai ∈ IR . ˜ Assume that there are k classes in the data set. The within-class scatter matrix S w , the betweenclass scatter matrix Sb , and the total scatter matrix St involved in linear discriminant analysis are deﬁned as follows (Fukunaga, 1990): k Sw = ∑ (Ai − ci eT )(Ai − ci eT )T , i=1 k Sb = ∑ ni (ci − c)(ci − c)T , i=1 k St = ∑ (Ai − ceT )(Ai − ceT )T , i=1 where Ai denotes the data matrix of the i-th class, ci = Ai e/ni is the centroid of the i-th class, ni is the sample size of the i-th class, c = Ae/n is the global centroid, and e is the vector of all ones with an appropriate length. It is easy to verify that St = Sb + Sw . In Ye (2005), the optimal transformation G is computed by maximizing a generalized Fisher criterion as follows: + G = arg max trace GT St G GT Sb G , (1) m× G∈IR c 2008 Jieping Ye. YE where M + denotes the pseudo-inverse (Golub and Van Loan, 1996) of M and it is introduced to overcome the singularity problem when dealing with high-dimensional low-sample-size data. 1.1 Equivalent Transformation Two linear transformations G1 and G2 can be considered equivalent if there is a vector v such that GT (ai − v) = GT (ai − v), for i = 1, · · · , n. Indeed, in this case, the difference between the projections 1 2 by G1 and G2 is a mere shift. Deﬁnition 1.1 For a given data set {a1 , · · · , an }, two transformations G1 and G2 are equivalent, if there is a vector v such that GT (ai − v) = GT (ai − v), for i = 1, · · · , n. 1 2 2. Characterization of Solutions to the Generalized Fisher Criterion Let St = UΣU T be the orthogonal eigendecomposition of St (note that St is symmetric and positive semi-deﬁnite), where U ∈ IRd×d is orthogonal and Σ ∈ IRd×d is diagonal with nonnegative diagonal entries sorted in nonincreasing order. Denote Σr as the r-th principal submatrix of Σ, where r = rank(St ). Partition U into two components as U = [U1 ,U2 ], where U1 ∈ IRd×r and U2 ∈ IRd×(d−r) . Note that r ≤ n, and for high-dimensional low-sample-size data, U1 is much smaller than U2 . In Loog (2007), a complete family of solutions S to the maximization problem in Eq. (1) is given as (We correct the error in Loog (2007) by using U instead of U T .) S= U ΛZ Y ∈ IRd× Z ∈ IR × is nonsingular , Y ∈ IR(n−r)× , where Λ ∈ IRr× maximizes the following objective function: F0 (X) = trace −1 X T Σr X T X T (U1 SbU1 )X . ˜ In Ye (2005), a family of solutions S is given as ˜ S= U ΛZ 0 ∈ IRd× Z ∈ IR × is nonsingular . The only difference between these two characterizations of solutions is the matrix Y in S , which is ˜ replaced by the zero matrix in S . We show in the next section the equivalence relationship between these two characterizations. 3. Equivalent Solution Characterizations ˜ Consider the following two transformations G1 and G2 from S and S respectively: G1 = U ΛZ Y ∈ S, G2 = U 518 ΛZ 0 ˜ ∈ S. O N THE C OMPLETE C HARACTERIZATION OF S OLUTIONS TO A G ENERALIZED F ISHER C RITERION Recall that U = [U1 ,U2 ], where the columns of U2 span the null space of St . Hence, n T T T 0 = U2 St U2 = ∑ U2 (ai − c) · (U2 (ai − c))T , i=1 T and U2 (ai − c) = 0, for i = 1, · · · , n, where c is the global centroid. It follows that T T T GT (ai − c) = Z T ΛT U1 (ai − c) +Y T U2 (ai − c) = Z T ΛT U1 (ai − c) = GT (ai − c), 1 2 for i = 1, · · · , n. That is, G1 and G2 are equivalent transformations. Hence, the two solution charac˜ terizations S and S are essentially equivalent. Remark 3.1 The analysis above shows that the additional information contained in S is the null ˜ space, U2 , of St , which leads to an equivalent transformation. In S , the null space U2 is removed, which can be further justiﬁed as follows. Since St = Sb + Sw , we have T T T 0 = U2 St U2 = U2 SbU2 +U2 SwU2 . T It follows that U2 SbU2 = 0, as both Sb and Sw are positive semi-deﬁnite. Thus, the null space U2 does not contain any discriminant information. This explains why the null space of St is removed in most discriminant analysis based algorithms proposed in the past. 4. Efﬁciency Comparison In S , the full matrix U is involved, whose computation may be expensive, especially for high˜ dimensional data. In contrast, only the ﬁrst component U1 ∈ IRd×r of U is involved in S , which can be computed efﬁciently for high-dimensional low-sample-size problem by directly working on the Gram matrix instead of the covariance matrix. ˜ In summary, we show that S and S are equivalent characterizations of the solutions to the generalized Fisher criterion in Eq. (1). However, the latter one is preferred in practice due to its relative efﬁciency for high-dimensional low-sample-size data. References K. Fukunaga.

In this paper we present empirical evidence that raises questions about this view. Although the statistical perspective provides a theoretical framework within which it is possible to derive theorems and create new algorithms in general contexts, we show that there remain many unanswered important questions. Furthermore, we provide examples that reveal crucial ﬂaws in the many practical suggestions and new methods that are derived from the statistical view. We perform carefully designed experiments using simple simulation models to illustrate some of these ﬂaws and their practical consequences.

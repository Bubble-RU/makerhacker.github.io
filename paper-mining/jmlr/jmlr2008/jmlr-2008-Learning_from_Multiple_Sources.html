<p>Author: Hannes Nickisch, Carl Edward Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We provide a comprehensive overview of many recent algorithms for approximate inference in Gaussian process models for probabilistic binary classiﬁcation. The relationships between several approaches are elucidated theoretically, and the properties of the different algorithms are corroborated by experimental results. We examine both 1) the quality of the predictive distributions and 2) the suitability of the different marginal likelihood approximations for model selection (selecting hyperparameters) and compare to a gold standard based on MCMC. Interestingly, some methods produce good predictive distributions although their marginal likelihood approximations are poor. Strong conclusions are drawn about the methods: The Expectation Propagation algorithm is almost always the method of choice unless the computational budget is very tight. We also extend existing methods in various ways, and provide unifying code implementing all approaches.

<p>Author: Andreas Maurer</p><p>Abstract: A method is introduced to learn and represent similarity with linear operators in kernel induced Hilbert spaces. Transferring error bounds for vector valued large-margin classiﬁers to the setting of Hilbert-Schmidt operators leads to dimension free bounds on a risk functional for linear representations and motivates a regularized objective functional. Minimization of this objective is effected by a simple technique of stochastic gradient descent. The resulting representations are tested on transfer problems in image processing, involving plane and spatial geometric invariants, handwritten characters and face recognition.

<p>Author: David C. Hoyle</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian inference from high-dimensional data involves the integration over a large number of model parameters. Accurate evaluation of such high-dimensional integrals raises a unique set of issues. These issues are illustrated using the exemplar of model selection for principal component analysis (PCA). A Bayesian model selection criterion, based on a Laplace approximation to the model evidence for determining the number of signal principal components present in a data set, has previously been show to perform well on various test data sets. Using simulated data we show that for d-dimensional data and small sample sizes, N, the accuracy of this model selection method is strongly affected by increasing values of d. By taking proper account of the contribution to the evidence from the large number of model parameters we show that model selection accuracy is substantially improved. The accuracy of the improved model evidence is studied in the asymptotic limit d → ∞ at ﬁxed ratio α = N/d, with α < 1. In this limit, model selection based upon the improved model evidence agrees with a frequentist hypothesis testing approach.

Recent research explores some extensions of this large margin based method to the multicategory case. We show a moment bound for the socalled multi-hinge loss minimizers based on two kinds of complexity constraints: entropy with bracketing and empirical entropy.

<p>Author: Elisa Ricci, Tijl De Bie, Nello Cristianini</p><p>Abstract: Most approaches to structured output prediction rely on a hypothesis space of prediction functions that compute their output by maximizing a linear scoring function. In this paper we present two novel learning algorithms for this hypothesis class, and a statistical analysis of their performance. The methods rely on efﬁciently computing the ﬁrst two moments of the scoring function over the output space, and using them to create convex objective functions for training. We report extensive experimental results for sequence alignment, named entity recognition, and RNA secondary structure prediction.

<p>Author: Suhrid Balakrishnan, David Madigan</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁers favoring sparse solutions, such as support vector machines, relevance vector machines, LASSO-regression based classiﬁers, etc., provide competitive methods for classiﬁcation problems in high dimensions. However, current algorithms for training sparse classiﬁers typically scale quite unfavorably with respect to the number of training examples. This paper proposes online and multipass algorithms for training sparse linear classiﬁers for high dimensional data. These algorithms have computational complexity and memory requirements that make learning on massive data sets feasible. The central idea that makes this possible is a straightforward quadratic approximation to the likelihood function.

<p>Author: Bernadetta Tarigan, Sara A. van de Geer</p><p>Abstract: The success of support vector machines in binary classiﬁcation relies on the fact that hinge loss employed in the risk minimization targets the Bayes rule. Recent research explores some extensions of this large margin based method to the multicategory case. We show a moment bound for the socalled multi-hinge loss minimizers based on two kinds of complexity constraints: entropy with bracketing and empirical entropy. Obtaining such a result based on the latter is harder than ﬁnding one based on the former. We obtain fast rates of convergence that adapt to the unknown margin. Keywords: multi-hinge classiﬁcation, all-at-once, moment bound, fast rate, entropy</p><p>6 0.68129468 <a title="52-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2008-Classification_with_a_Reject_Option_using_a_Hinge_Loss.html">21 jmlr-2008-Classification with a Reject Option using a Hinge Loss</a></p>

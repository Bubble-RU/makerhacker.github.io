<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Marten H. Wegkamp</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of binary classiﬁcation where the classiﬁer can, for a particular cost, choose not to classify an observation. Just as in the conventional classiﬁcation problem, minimization of the sample average of the cost is a difﬁcult optimization problem. As an alternative, we propose the optimization of a certain convex loss function φ, analogous to the hinge loss used in support vector machines (SVMs). Its convexity ensures that the sample average of this surrogate loss can be efﬁciently minimized. We study its statistical properties. We show that minimizing the expected surrogate loss—the φ-risk—also minimizes the risk. We also study the rate at which the φ-risk approaches its minimum value. We show that fast rates are possible when the conditional probability P(Y = 1|X) is unlikely to be close to certain critical values.

<p>Author: Rémi Munos, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop a theoretical analysis of the performance of sampling-based ﬁtted value iteration (FVI) to solve inﬁnite state-space, discounted-reward Markovian decision processes (MDPs) under the assumption that a generative model of the environment is available. Our main results come in the form of ﬁnite-time bounds on the performance of two versions of sampling-based FVI. The convergence rate results obtained allow us to show that both versions of FVI are well behaving in the sense that by using a sufﬁciently large number of samples for a large class of MDPs, arbitrary good performance can be achieved with high probability. An important feature of our proof technique is that it permits the study of weighted L p -norm performance bounds. As a result, our technique applies to a large class of function-approximation methods (e.g., neural networks, adaptive regression trees, kernel machines, locally weighted learning), and our bounds scale well with the effective horizon of the MDP. The bounds show a dependence on the stochastic stability properties of the MDP: they scale with the discounted-average concentrability of the future-state distributions. They also depend on a new measure of the approximation power of the function space, the inherent Bellman residual, which reﬂects how well the function space is “aligned” with the dynamics and rewards of the MDP. The conditions of the main result, as well as the concepts introduced in the analysis, are extensively discussed and compared to previous theoretical results. Numerical experiments are used to substantiate the theoretical ﬁndings.

It has been shown that a reduction of the dimension of the input space leads to even better results. For this purpose, we propose two information criteria which can be computed directly from the deﬁnition of the support vector machine. We assess the predictive performance of the models selected by our new criteria and compare them to existing variable selection techniques in a simulation study.

Transferring error bounds for vector valued large-margin classiﬁers to the setting of Hilbert-Schmidt operators leads to dimension free bounds on a risk functional for linear representations and motivates a regularized objective functional. Minimization of this objective is effected by a simple technique of stochastic gradient descent. The resulting representations are tested on transfer problems in image processing, involving plane and spatial geometric invariants, handwritten characters and face recognition.

In this paper we propose the “minimal nonlinear distortion” (MND) principle for tackling the ill-posedness of nonlinear ICA problems. MND prefers the nonlinear ICA solution with the estimated mixing procedure as close as possible to linear, among all possible solutions. It also helps to avoid local optima in the solutions. To achieve MND, we exploit a regularization term to minimize the mean square error between the nonlinear mixing mapping and the best-ﬁtting linear one. The effect of MND on the inherent trivial and non-trivial indeterminacies in nonlinear ICA solutions is investigated. Moreover, we show that local MND is closely related to the smoothness regularizer penalizing large curvature, which provides another useful regularization condition for nonlinear ICA. Experiments on synthetic data show the usefulness of the MND principle for separating various nonlinear mixtures. Finally, as an application, we use nonlinear ICA with MND to separate daily returns of a set of stocks in Hong Kong, and the linear causal relations among them are successfully discovered. The resulting causal relations give some interesting insights into the stock market. Such a result can not be achieved by linear ICA. Simulation studies also verify that when doing causality discovery, sometimes one should not ignore the nonlinear distortion in the data generation procedure, even if it is weak.

<p>Author: Amit Dhurandhar, Alin Dobra</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we use the methodology introduced by Dhurandhar and Dobra (2009) for analyzing the error of classiﬁers and the model selection measures, to analyze decision tree algorithms. The methodology consists of obtaining parametric expressions for the moments of the generalization error (GE) for the classiﬁcation model of interest, followed by plotting these expressions for interpretability. The major challenge in applying the methodology to decision trees, the main theme of this work, is customizing the generic expressions for the moments of GE to this particular classiﬁcation algorithm. The speciﬁc contributions we make in this paper are: (a) we primarily characterize a subclass of decision trees namely, Random decision trees, (b) we discuss how the analysis extends to other decision tree algorithms and (c) in order to extend the analysis to certain model selection measures, we generalize the relationships between the moments of GE and moments of the model selection measures given in (Dhurandhar and Dobra, 2009) to randomized classiﬁcation algorithms. An empirical comparison of the proposed method with Monte Carlo and distribution free bounds obtained using Breiman’s formula, depicts the advantages of the method in terms of running time and accuracy. It thus showcases the use of the deployed methodology as an exploratory tool to study learning algorithms.

<p>Author: Imhoi Koo, Rhee Man Kil</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new method of model selection for regression problems using the modulus of continuity. For this purpose, we suggest the prediction risk bounds of regression models using the modulus of continuity which can be interpreted as the complexity of functions. We also present the model selection criterion referred to as the modulus of continuity information criterion (MCIC) which is derived from the suggested prediction risk bounds. The suggested MCIC provides a risk estimate using the modulus of continuity for a trained regression model (or an estimation function) while other model selection criteria such as the AIC and BIC use structural information such as the number of training parameters. As a result, the suggested MCIC is able to discriminate the performances of trained regression models, even with the same structure of training models. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, the simulation for function approximation using the multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) was conducted. Through the simulation for function approximation, it was demonstrated that the suggested MCIC provides a good selection tool for nonlinear regression models, even with the limited size of data.

<p>Author: Jorge Jambeiro Filho, Jacques Wainer</p><p>Abstract: We replaced the conditional probability tables of Bayesian network nodes whose parents have high cardinality with a multilevel empirical hierarchical Bayesian model called hierarchical pattern Bayes (HPB).1 The resulting Bayesian networks achieved signiÄ?Ĺš cant performance improvements over Bayesian networks with the same structure and traditional conditional probability tables, over Bayesian networks with simpler structures like naĂ&sbquo;Â¨ve Bayes and tree augmented naĂ&sbquo;Â¨ve Bayes, over Ă&bdquo;Ä&hellip; Ă&bdquo;Ä&hellip; Bayesian networks where traditional conditional probability tables were substituted by noisy-OR gates, default tables, decision trees and decision graphs and over Bayesian networks constructed after a cardinality reduction preprocessing phase using the agglomerative information bottleneck method. Our main tests took place in important fraud detection domains, which are characterized by the presence of high cardinality attributes and by the existence of relevant interactions among them. Other tests, over UCI data sets, show that HPB may have a quite wide applicability.

<p>Author: Sébastien Loustau</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates statistical performances of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and considers the problem of adaptation to the margin parameter and to complexity. In particular we provide a classiﬁer with no tuning parameter. It is a combination of SVM classiﬁers. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we propose learning rates for SVM using Sobolev spaces and build a numerically realizable aggregate that converges with same rate; (2) we present practical experiments of this method of aggregation for SVM using both Sobolev spaces and Gaussian kernels.

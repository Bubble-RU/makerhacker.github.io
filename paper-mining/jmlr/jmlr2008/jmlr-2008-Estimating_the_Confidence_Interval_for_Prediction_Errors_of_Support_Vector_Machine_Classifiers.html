<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Ja-Yong Koo, Yoonkyung Lee, Yuwon Kim, Changyi Park</p><p>Abstract: The support vector machine has been successful in a variety of applications. Also on the theoretical front, statistical properties of the support vector machine have been studied quite extensively with a particular attention to its Bayes risk consistency under some conditions. In this paper, we study somewhat basic statistical properties of the support vector machine yet to be investigated, namely the asymptotic behavior of the coefﬁcients of the linear support vector machine. A Bahadur type representation of the coefﬁcients is established under appropriate conditions, and their asymptotic normality and statistical variability are derived on the basis of the representation. These asymptotic results do not only help further our understanding of the support vector machine, but also they can be useful for related statistical inferences.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We propose a highly efﬁcient framework for penalized likelihood kernel methods applied to multiclass models with a large, structured set of classes. As opposed to many previous approaches which try to decompose the ﬁtting problem into many smaller ones, we focus on a Newton optimization of the complete model, making use of model structure and linear conjugate gradients in order to approximate Newton search directions. Crucially, our learning method is based entirely on matrix-vector multiplication primitives with the kernel matrices and their derivatives, allowing straightforward specialization to new kernels, and focusing code optimization efforts to these primitives only. Kernel parameters are learned automatically, by maximizing the cross-validation log likelihood in a gradient-based way, and predictive probabilities are estimated. We demonstrate our approach on large scale text classiﬁcation tasks with hierarchical structure on thousands of classes, achieving state-of-the-art results in an order of magnitude less time than previous work.

<p>Author: Jörg Lücke,  Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: We study a generative model in which hidden causes combine competitively to produce observations. Multiple active causes combine to determine the value of an observed variable through a max function, in the place where algorithms such as sparse coding, independent component analysis, or non-negative matrix factorization would use a sum. This max rule can represent a more realistic model of non-linear interaction between basic components in many settings, including acoustic and image data. While exact maximum-likelihood learning of the parameters of this model proves to be intractable, we show that efﬁcient approximations to expectation-maximization (EM) can be found in the case of sparsely active hidden causes. One of these approximations can be formulated as a neural network model with a generalized softmax activation function and Hebbian learning. Thus, we show that learning in recent softmax-like neural networks may be interpreted as approximate maximization of a data likelihood. We use the bars benchmark test to numerically verify our analytical results and to demonstrate the competitiveness of the resulting algorithms. Finally, we show results of learning model parameters to ﬁt acoustic and visual data sets in which max-like component combinations arise naturally.

<p>Author: Hannes Nickisch, Carl Edward Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We provide a comprehensive overview of many recent algorithms for approximate inference in Gaussian process models for probabilistic binary classiﬁcation. The relationships between several approaches are elucidated theoretically, and the properties of the different algorithms are corroborated by experimental results. We examine both 1) the quality of the predictive distributions and 2) the suitability of the different marginal likelihood approximations for model selection (selecting hyperparameters) and compare to a gold standard based on MCMC. Interestingly, some methods produce good predictive distributions although their marginal likelihood approximations are poor. Strong conclusions are drawn about the methods: The Expectation Propagation algorithm is almost always the method of choice unless the computational budget is very tight. We also extend existing methods in various ways, and provide unifying code implementing all approaches.

Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Alain Rakotomamonjy, Francis R. Bach, Stéphane Canu, Yves Grandvalet</p><p>Abstract: Multiple kernel learning (MKL) aims at simultaneously learning a kernel and the associated predictor in supervised learning settings. For the support vector machine, an efﬁcient and general multiple kernel learning algorithm, based on semi-inﬁnite linear programming, has been recently proposed. This approach has opened new perspectives since it makes MKL tractable for large-scale problems, by iteratively using existing support vector machine code. However, it turns out that this iterative algorithm needs numerous iterations for converging towards a reasonable solution. In this paper, we address the MKL problem through a weighted 2-norm regularization formulation with an additional constraint on the weights that encourages sparse kernel combinations. Apart from learning the combination, we solve a standard SVM optimization problem, where the kernel is deﬁned as a linear combination of multiple kernels. We propose an algorithm, named SimpleMKL, for solving this MKL problem and provide a new insight on MKL algorithms based on mixed-norm regularization by showing that the two approaches are equivalent. We show how SimpleMKL can be applied beyond binary classiﬁcation, for problems like regression, clustering (one-class classiﬁcation) or multiclass classiﬁcation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm converges rapidly and that its efﬁciency compares favorably to other MKL algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of MKL for some regressors based on wavelet kernels and on some model selection problems related to multiclass classiﬁcation problems.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We propose a highly efﬁcient framework for penalized likelihood kernel methods applied to multiclass models with a large, structured set of classes. As opposed to many previous approaches which try to decompose the ﬁtting problem into many smaller ones, we focus on a Newton optimization of the complete model, making use of model structure and linear conjugate gradients in order to approximate Newton search directions. Crucially, our learning method is based entirely on matrix-vector multiplication primitives with the kernel matrices and their derivatives, allowing straightforward specialization to new kernels, and focusing code optimization efforts to these primitives only. Kernel parameters are learned automatically, by maximizing the cross-validation log likelihood in a gradient-based way, and predictive probabilities are estimated. We demonstrate our approach on large scale text classiﬁcation tasks with hierarchical structure on thousands of classes, achieving state-of-the-art results in an order of magnitude less time than previous work.

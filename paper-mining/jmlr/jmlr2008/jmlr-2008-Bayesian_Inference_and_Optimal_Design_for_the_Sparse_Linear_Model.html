<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We propose a highly efﬁcient framework for penalized likelihood kernel methods applied to multiclass models with a large, structured set of classes. As opposed to many previous approaches which try to decompose the ﬁtting problem into many smaller ones, we focus on a Newton optimization of the complete model, making use of model structure and linear conjugate gradients in order to approximate Newton search directions. Crucially, our learning method is based entirely on matrix-vector multiplication primitives with the kernel matrices and their derivatives, allowing straightforward specialization to new kernels, and focusing code optimization efforts to these primitives only. Kernel parameters are learned automatically, by maximizing the cross-validation log likelihood in a gradient-based way, and predictive probabilities are estimated. We demonstrate our approach on large scale text classiﬁcation tasks with hierarchical structure on thousands of classes, achieving state-of-the-art results in an order of magnitude less time than previous work.

<p>Author: Suhrid Balakrishnan, David Madigan</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁers favoring sparse solutions, such as support vector machines, relevance vector machines, LASSO-regression based classiﬁers, etc., provide competitive methods for classiﬁcation problems in high dimensions. However, current algorithms for training sparse classiﬁers typically scale quite unfavorably with respect to the number of training examples. This paper proposes online and multipass algorithms for training sparse linear classiﬁers for high dimensional data. These algorithms have computational complexity and memory requirements that make learning on massive data sets feasible. The central idea that makes this possible is a straightforward quadratic approximation to the likelihood function.

<p>Author: Alexandre d'Aspremont, Francis Bach, Laurent El Ghaoui</p><p>Abstract: Given a sample covariance matrix, we examine the problem of maximizing the variance explained by a linear combination of the input variables while constraining the number of nonzero coefﬁcients in this combination. This is known as sparse principal component analysis and has a wide array of applications in machine learning and engineering. We formulate a new semideﬁnite relaxation to this problem and derive a greedy algorithm that computes a full set of good solutions for all target numbers of non zero coefﬁcients, with total complexity O(n3 ), where n is the number of variables. We then use the same relaxation to derive sufﬁcient conditions for global optimality of a solution, which can be tested in O(n3 ) per pattern. We discuss applications in subset selection and sparse recovery and show on artiﬁcial examples and biological data that our algorithm does provide globally optimal solutions in many cases.

<p>Author: Michiel Debruyne, Mia Hubert, Johan A.K. Suykens</p><p>Abstract: Recent results about the robustness of kernel methods involve the analysis of inﬂuence functions. By deﬁnition the inﬂuence function is closely related to leave-one-out criteria. In statistical learning, the latter is often used to assess the generalization of a method. In statistics, the inﬂuence function is used in a similar way to analyze the statistical efﬁciency of a method. Links between both worlds are explored. The inﬂuence function is related to the ﬁrst term of a Taylor expansion. Higher order inﬂuence functions are calculated. A recursive relation between these terms is found characterizing the full Taylor expansion. It is shown how to evaluate inﬂuence functions at a speciﬁc sample distribution to obtain an approximation of the leave-one-out error. A speciﬁc implementation is proposed using a L1 loss in the selection of the hyperparameters and a Huber loss in the estimation procedure. The parameter in the Huber loss controlling the degree of robustness is optimized as well. The resulting procedure gives good results, even when outliers are present in the data.

We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on the application of gene regulatory network identiﬁcation from micro-array expression data, where both the Laplace prior and the active experimental design approach are shown to result in signiﬁcant improvements. We also address the problem of sparse coding of natural images, and show how our framework can be used for compressive sensing tasks. Part of this work appeared in Seeger et al. (2007b). The gene network identiﬁcation application appears in Steinke et al. (2007).

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We propose a highly efﬁcient framework for penalized likelihood kernel methods applied to multiclass models with a large, structured set of classes. As opposed to many previous approaches which try to decompose the ﬁtting problem into many smaller ones, we focus on a Newton optimization of the complete model, making use of model structure and linear conjugate gradients in order to approximate Newton search directions. Crucially, our learning method is based entirely on matrix-vector multiplication primitives with the kernel matrices and their derivatives, allowing straightforward specialization to new kernels, and focusing code optimization efforts to these primitives only. Kernel parameters are learned automatically, by maximizing the cross-validation log likelihood in a gradient-based way, and predictive probabilities are estimated. We demonstrate our approach on large scale text classiﬁcation tasks with hierarchical structure on thousands of classes, achieving state-of-the-art results in an order of magnitude less time than previous work. Parts of this work appeared in the conference paper Seeger (2007).

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Rémi Munos, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop a theoretical analysis of the performance of sampling-based ﬁtted value iteration (FVI) to solve inﬁnite state-space, discounted-reward Markovian decision processes (MDPs) under the assumption that a generative model of the environment is available. Our main results come in the form of ﬁnite-time bounds on the performance of two versions of sampling-based FVI. The convergence rate results obtained allow us to show that both versions of FVI are well behaving in the sense that by using a sufﬁciently large number of samples for a large class of MDPs, arbitrary good performance can be achieved with high probability. An important feature of our proof technique is that it permits the study of weighted L p -norm performance bounds. As a result, our technique applies to a large class of function-approximation methods (e.g., neural networks, adaptive regression trees, kernel machines, locally weighted learning), and our bounds scale well with the effective horizon of the MDP. The bounds show a dependence on the stochastic stability properties of the MDP: they scale with the discounted-average concentrability of the future-state distributions. They also depend on a new measure of the approximation power of the function space, the inherent Bellman residual, which reﬂects how well the function space is “aligned” with the dynamics and rewards of the MDP. The conditions of the main result, as well as the concepts introduced in the analysis, are extensively discussed and compared to previous theoretical results. Numerical experiments are used to substantiate the theoretical ﬁndings.

<p>Author: David C. Hoyle</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian inference from high-dimensional data involves the integration over a large number of model parameters. Accurate evaluation of such high-dimensional integrals raises a unique set of issues. These issues are illustrated using the exemplar of model selection for principal component analysis (PCA). A Bayesian model selection criterion, based on a Laplace approximation to the model evidence for determining the number of signal principal components present in a data set, has previously been show to perform well on various test data sets. Using simulated data we show that for d-dimensional data and small sample sizes, N, the accuracy of this model selection method is strongly affected by increasing values of d. By taking proper account of the contribution to the evidence from the large number of model parameters we show that model selection accuracy is substantially improved. The accuracy of the improved model evidence is studied in the asymptotic limit d → ∞ at ﬁxed ratio α = N/d, with α < 1. In this limit, model selection based upon the improved model evidence agrees with a frequentist hypothesis testing approach.

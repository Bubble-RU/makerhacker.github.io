<p>Author: Andreas Christmann, Arnout Van Messem</p><p>Abstract: We investigate robustness properties for a broad class of support vector machines with non-smooth loss functions. These kernel methods are inspired by convex risk minimization in inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Leading examples are the support vector machine based on the ε-insensitive loss function, and kernel based quantile regression based on the pinball loss function. Firstly, we propose with the Bouligand inﬂuence function (BIF) a modiﬁcation of F.R. Hampel’s inﬂuence function. The BIF has the advantage of being positive homogeneous which is in general not true for Hampel’s inﬂuence function. Secondly, we show that many support vector machines based on a Lipschitz continuous loss function and a bounded kernel have a bounded BIF and are thus robust in the sense of robust statistics based on inﬂuence functions.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: The linear model with sparsity-favouring prior on the coefﬁcients has important applications in many different domains. In machine learning, most methods to date search for maximum a posteriori sparse solutions and neglect to represent posterior uncertainties. In this paper, we address problems of Bayesian optimal design (or experiment planning), for which accurate estimates of uncertainty are essential. To this end, we employ expectation propagation approximate inference for the linear model with Laplace prior, giving new insight into numerical stability properties and proposing a robust algorithm. We also show how to estimate model hyperparameters by empirical Bayesian maximisation of the marginal likelihood, and propose ideas in order to scale up the method to very large underdetermined problems. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on the application of gene regulatory network identiﬁcation from micro-array expression data, where both the Laplace prior and the active experimental design approach are shown to result in signiﬁcant improvements. We also address the problem of sparse coding of natural images, and show how our framework can be used for compressive sensing tasks. Part of this work appeared in Seeger et al. (2007b). The gene network identiﬁcation application appears in Steinke et al. (2007).

<p>Author: Xing Sun, Andrew B. Nobel</p><p>Abstract: Binary matrices, and their associated submatrices of 1s, play a central role in the study of random bipartite graphs and in core data mining problems such as frequent itemset mining (FIM). Motivated by these connections, this paper addresses several statistical questions regarding submatrices of 1s in a random binary matrix with independent Bernoulli entries. We establish a three-point concentration result, and a related probability bound, for the size of the largest square submatrix of 1s in a square Bernoulli matrix, and extend these results to non-square matrices and submatrices with ﬁxed aspect ratios. We then consider the noise sensitivity of frequent itemset mining under a simple binary additive noise model, and show that, even at small noise levels, large blocks of 1s leave behind fragments of only logarithmic size. As a result, standard FIM algorithms, which search only for submatrices of 1s, cannot directly recover such blocks when noise is present. On the positive side, we show that an error-tolerant frequent itemset criterion can recover a submatrix of 1s against a background of 0s plus noise, even when the size of the submatrix of 1s is very small. 1 Keywords: frequent itemset mining, bipartite graph, biclique, submatrix of 1s, statistical signiﬁcance</p><p>5 0.049701866 <a title="22-tfidf-5" href="./jmlr-2008-Universal_Multi-Task_Kernels.html">92 jmlr-2008-Universal Multi-Task Kernels</a></p>

The reproducing kernel K associated to HK has its values as operators on Y . Our primary goal here is to derive conditions which ensure that the kernel K is universal. This means that on every compact subset of the input space, every continuous function with values in Y can be uniformly approximated by sections of the kernel. We provide various characterizations of universal kernels and highlight them with several concrete examples of some practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles of functional analysis and especially the useful notion of vector measures which we describe in sufﬁcient detail to clarify our results.

<p>Author: Andreas Maurer</p><p>Abstract: A method is introduced to learn and represent similarity with linear operators in kernel induced Hilbert spaces. Transferring error bounds for vector valued large-margin classiﬁers to the setting of Hilbert-Schmidt operators leads to dimension free bounds on a risk functional for linear representations and motivates a regularized objective functional. Minimization of this objective is effected by a simple technique of stochastic gradient descent. The resulting representations are tested on transfer problems in image processing, involving plane and spatial geometric invariants, handwritten characters and face recognition.

<p>Author: Tzu-Kuo Huang, Chih-Jen Lin, Ruby C. Weng</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes new approaches to rank individuals from their group comparison results. Many real-world problems are of this type. For example, ranking players from team comparisons is important in some sports. In machine learning, a closely related application is classiﬁcation using coding matrices. Group comparison results are usually in two types: binary indicator outcomes (wins/losses) or measured outcomes (scores). For each type of results, we propose new models for estimating individuals’ abilities, and hence a ranking of individuals. The estimation is carried out by solving convex minimization problems, for which we develop easy and efﬁcient solution procedures. Experiments on real bridge records and multi-class classiﬁcation demonstrate the viability of the proposed models.

<p>Author: Salvador García, Francisco Herrera</p><p>Abstract: In a recently published paper in JMLR, Demˇar (2006) recommends a set of non-parametric stas tistical tests and procedures which can be safely used for comparing the performance of classiﬁers over multiple data sets. After studying the paper, we realize that the paper correctly introduces the basic procedures and some of the most advanced ones when comparing a control method. However, it does not deal with some advanced topics in depth. Regarding these topics, we focus on more powerful proposals of statistical procedures for comparing n × n classiﬁers. Moreover, we illustrate an easy way of obtaining adjusted and comparable p-values in multiple comparison procedures.

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: We consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a block 1 -norm, that is, a sum of Euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger than one. This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual regularization by the 1 -norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic group selection consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model misspeciﬁcation. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the consistency results to this inﬁnite dimensional case and also propose an adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisﬁed.

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

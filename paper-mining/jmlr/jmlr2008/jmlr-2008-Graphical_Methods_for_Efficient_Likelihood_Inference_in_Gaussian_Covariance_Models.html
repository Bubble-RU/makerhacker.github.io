<p>Author: Yang-Bo He, Zhi Geng</p><p>Abstract: The causal discovery from data is important for various scientiﬁc investigations. Because we cannot distinguish the different directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in a Markov equivalence class learned from observational data, we have to collect further information on causal structures from experiments with external interventions. In this paper, we propose an active learning approach for discovering causal structures in which we ﬁrst ﬁnd a Markov equivalence class from observational data, and then we orient undirected edges in every chain component via intervention experiments separately. In the experiments, some variables are manipulated through external interventions. We discuss two kinds of intervention experiments, randomized experiment and quasi-experiment. Furthermore, we give two optimal designs of experiments, a batch-intervention design and a sequential-intervention design, to minimize the number of manipulated variables and the set of candidate structures based on the minimax and the maximum entropy criteria. We show theoretically that structural learning can be done locally in subgraphs of chain components without need of checking illegal v-structures and cycles in the whole network and that a Markov equivalence subclass obtained after each intervention can still be depicted as a chain graph.

<p>Author: Jiji Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Causal reasoning is primarily concerned with what would happen to a system under external interventions. In particular, we are often interested in predicting the probability distribution of some random variables that would result if some other variables were forced to take certain values. One prominent approach to tackling this problem is based on causal Bayesian networks, using directed acyclic graphs as causal diagrams to relate post-intervention probabilities to pre-intervention probabilities that are estimable from observational data. However, such causal diagrams are seldom fully testable given observational data. In consequence, many causal discovery algorithms based on data-mining can only output an equivalence class of causal diagrams (rather than a single one). This paper is concerned with causal reasoning given an equivalence class of causal diagrams, represented by a (partial) ancestral graph. We present two main results. The ﬁrst result extends Pearl (1995)’s celebrated do-calculus to the context of ancestral graphs. In the second result, we focus on a key component of Pearl’s calculus—the property of invariance under interventions, and give stronger graphical conditions for this property than those implied by the ﬁrst result. The second result also improves the earlier, similar results due to Spirtes et al. (1993).

<p>Author: Xianchao Xie, Zhi Geng</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recursive method for structural learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), in which a problem of structural learning for a large DAG is ﬁrst decomposed into two problems of structural learning for two small vertex subsets, each of which is then decomposed recursively into two problems of smaller subsets until none subset can be decomposed further. In our approach, search for separators of a pair of variables in a large DAG is localized to small subsets, and thus the approach can improve the efﬁciency of searches and the power of statistical tests for structural learning. We show how the recent advances in the learning of undirected graphical models can be employed to facilitate the decomposition. Simulations are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

<p>Author: Zongming Ma, Xianchao Xie, Zhi Geng</p><p>Abstract: Chain graphs present a broad class of graphical models for description of conditional independence structures, including both Markov networks and Bayesian networks as special cases. In this paper, we propose a computationally feasible method for the structural learning of chain graphs based on the idea of decomposing the learning problem into a set of smaller scale problems on its decomposed subgraphs. The decomposition requires conditional independencies but does not require the separators to be complete subgraphs. Algorithms for both skeleton recovery and complex arrow orientation are presented. Simulations under a variety of settings demonstrate the competitive performance of our method, especially when the underlying graph is sparse.

<p>Author: Jean-Philippe Pellet, André Elisseeff</p><p>Abstract: We show how a generic feature-selection algorithm returning strongly relevant variables can be turned into a causal structure-learning algorithm. We prove this under the Faithfulness assumption for the data distribution. In a causal graph, the strongly relevant variables for a node X are its parents, children, and children’s parents (or spouses), also known as the Markov blanket of X. Identifying the spouses leads to the detection of the V-structure patterns and thus to causal orientations. Repeating the task for all variables yields a valid partially oriented causal graph. We ﬁrst show an efﬁcient way to identify the spouse links. We then perform several experiments in the continuous domain using the Recursive Feature Elimination feature-selection algorithm with Support Vector Regression and empirically verify the intuition of this direct (but computationally expensive) approach. Within the same framework, we then devise a fast and consistent algorithm, Total Conditioning (TC), and a variant, TCbw , with an explicit backward feature-selection heuristics, for Gaussian data. After running a series of comparative experiments on ﬁve artiﬁcial networks, we argue that Markov blanket algorithms such as TC/TCbw or Grow-Shrink scale better than the reference PC algorithm and provides higher structural accuracy.

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: We consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a block 1 -norm, that is, a sum of Euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger than one. This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual regularization by the 1 -norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic group selection consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model misspeciﬁcation. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the consistency results to this inﬁnite dimensional case and also propose an adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisﬁed.

<p>Author: Xianchao Xie, Zhi Geng</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recursive method for structural learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), in which a problem of structural learning for a large DAG is ﬁrst decomposed into two problems of structural learning for two small vertex subsets, each of which is then decomposed recursively into two problems of smaller subsets until none subset can be decomposed further. In our approach, search for separators of a pair of variables in a large DAG is localized to small subsets, and thus the approach can improve the efﬁciency of searches and the power of statistical tests for structural learning. We show how the recent advances in the learning of undirected graphical models can be employed to facilitate the decomposition. Simulations are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

<p>Author: Leonor Becerra-Bonache, Colin de la Higuera, Jean-Christophe Janodet, Frédéric Tantini</p><p>Abstract: When facing the question of learning languages in realistic settings, one has to tackle several problems that do not admit simple solutions. On the one hand, languages are usually deﬁned by complex grammatical mechanisms for which the learning results are predominantly negative, as the few algorithms are not really able to cope with noise. On the other hand, the learning settings themselves rely either on too simple information (text) or on unattainable one (query systems that do not exist in practice, nor can be simulated). We consider simple but sound classes of languages deﬁned via the widely used edit distance: the balls of strings. We propose to learn them with the help of a new sort of queries, called the correction queries: when a string is submitted to the Oracle, either she accepts it if it belongs to the target language, or she proposes a correction, that is, a string of the language close to the query with respect to the edit distance. We show that even if the good balls are not learnable in Angluin’s M AT model, they can be learned from a polynomial number of correction queries. Moreover, experimental evidence simulating a human Expert shows that this algorithm is resistant to approximate answers.

<p>Author: Shann-Ching Chen, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Robert F. Murphy</p><p>Abstract: In structured classiﬁcation problems, there is a direct conﬂict between expressive models and efﬁcient inference: while graphical models such as Markov random ﬁelds or factor graphs can represent arbitrary dependences among instance labels, the cost of inference via belief propagation in these models grows rapidly as the graph structure becomes more complicated. One important source of complexity in belief propagation is the need to marginalize large factors to compute messages. This operation takes time exponential in the number of variables in the factor, and can limit the expressiveness of the models we can use. In this paper, we study a new class of potential functions, which we call decomposable k-way potentials, and provide efﬁcient algorithms for computing messages from these potentials during belief propagation. We believe these new potentials provide a good balance between expressive power and efﬁcient inference in practical structured classiﬁcation problems. We discuss three instances of decomposable potentials: the associative Markov network potential, the nested junction tree, and a new type of potential which we call the voting potential. We use these potentials to classify images of protein subcellular location patterns in groups of cells. Classifying subcellular location patterns can help us answer many important questions in computational biology, including questions about how various treatments affect the synthesis and behavior of proteins and networks of proteins within a cell. Our new representation and algorithm lead to substantial improvements in both inference speed and classiﬁcation accuracy.

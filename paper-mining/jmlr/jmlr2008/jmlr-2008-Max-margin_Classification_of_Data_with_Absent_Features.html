<h1>58 jmlr-2008-Max-margin Classification of Data with Absent Features</h1>

<p>Author: Thomas G. Dietterich, Guohua Hao, Adam Ashenfelter</p><p>Abstract: Conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs) provide a ﬂexible and powerful model for sequence labeling problems. However, existing learning algorithms are slow, particularly in problems with large numbers of potential input features and feature combinations. This paper describes a new algorithm for training CRFs via gradient tree boosting. In tree boosting, the CRF potential functions are represented as weighted sums of regression trees, which provide compact representations of feature interactions. So the algorithm does not explicitly consider the potentially large parameter space. As a result, gradient tree boosting scales linearly in the order of the Markov model and in the order of the feature interactions, rather than exponentially as in previous algorithms based on iterative scaling and gradient descent. Gradient tree boosting also makes it possible to use instance weighting (as in C4.5) and surrogate splitting (as in CART) to handle missing values. Experimental studies of the effectiveness of these two methods (as well as standard imputation and indicator feature methods) show that instance weighting is the best method in most cases when feature values are missing at random.

<p>Author: Eyal Krupka, Amir Navot, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Feature selection is the task of choosing a small subset of features that is sufﬁcient to predict the target labels well. Here, instead of trying to directly determine which features are better, we attempt to learn the properties of good features. For this purpose we assume that each feature is represented by a set of properties, referred to as meta-features. This approach enables prediction of the quality of features without measuring their value on the training instances. We use this ability to devise new selection algorithms that can efﬁciently search for new good features in the presence of a huge number of features, and to dramatically reduce the number of feature measurements needed. We demonstrate our algorithms on a handwritten digit recognition problem and a visual object category recognition problem. In addition, we show how this novel viewpoint enables derivation of better generalization bounds for the joint learning problem of selection and classiﬁcation, and how it contributes to a better understanding of the problem. Speciﬁcally, in the context of object recognition, previous works showed that it is possible to ﬁnd one set of features which ﬁts most object categories (aka a universal dictionary). Here we use our framework to analyze one such universal dictionary and ﬁnd that the quality of features in this dictionary can be predicted accurately by its meta-features.

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Elena Marchiori</p><p>Abstract: In supervised learning, a training set consisting of labeled instances is used by a learning algorithm for generating a model (classiﬁer) that is subsequently employed for deciding the class label of new instances (for generalization). Characteristics of the training set, such as presence of noisy instances and size, inﬂuence the learning algorithm and affect generalization performance. This paper introduces a new network-based representation of a training set, called hit miss network (HMN), which provides a compact description of the nearest neighbor relation over pairs of instances from each pair of classes. We show that structural properties of HMN’s correspond to properties of training points related to the one nearest neighbor (1-NN) decision rule, such as being border or central point. This motivates us to use HMN’s for improving the performance of a 1-NN classiﬁer by removing instances from the training set (instance selection). We introduce three new HMN-based algorithms for instance selection. HMN-C, which removes instances without affecting accuracy of 1-NN on the original training set, HMN-E, based on a more aggressive storage reduction, and HMN-EI, which applies iteratively HMN-E. Their performance is assessed on 22 data sets with different characteristics, such as input dimension, cardinality, class balance, number of classes, noise content, and presence of redundant variables. Results of experiments on these data sets show that accuracy of 1-NN classiﬁer increases signiﬁcantly when HMN-EI is applied. Comparison with state-of-the-art editing algorithms for instance selection on these data sets indicates best generalization performance of HMN-EI and no signiﬁcant difference in storage requirements. In general, these results indicate that HMN’s provide a powerful graph-based representation of a training set, which can be successfully applied for performing noise and redundance reduction in instance-based learning.

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Geremy Heitz, Gal Elidan, Pieter Abbeel, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning classiﬁers in structured domains, where some objects have a subset of features that are inherently absent due to complex relationships between the features. Unlike the case where a feature exists but its value is not observed, here we focus on the case where a feature may not even exist (structurally absent) for some of the samples. The common approach for handling missing features in discriminative models is to ﬁrst complete their unknown values, and then use a standard classiﬁcation procedure over the completed data. This paper focuses on features that are known to be non-existing, rather than have an unknown value. We show how incomplete data can be classiﬁed directly without any completion of the missing features using a max-margin learning framework. We formulate an objective function, based on the geometric interpretation of the margin, that aims to maximize the margin of each sample in its own relevant subspace. In this formulation, the linearly separable case can be transformed into a binary search over a series of second order cone programs (SOCP), a convex problem that can be solved efﬁciently. We also describe two approaches for optimizing the general case: an approximation that can be solved as a standard quadratic program (QP) and an iterative approach for solving the exact problem. By avoiding the pre-processing phase in which the data is completed, both of these approaches could offer considerable computational savings. More importantly, we show that the elegant handling of missing values by our approach allows it to both outperform other methods when the missing values have non-trivial structure, and be competitive with other methods when the values are missing at random. We demonstrate our results on several standard benchmarks and two real-world problems: edge prediction in metabolic pathways, and automobile detection in natural images.

<p>Author: Andrea Caponnetto, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil, Yiming Ying</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces HK of functions from an input space into a Hilbert space Y , an environment appropriate for multi-task learning. The reproducing kernel K associated to HK has its values as operators on Y . Our primary goal here is to derive conditions which ensure that the kernel K is universal. This means that on every compact subset of the input space, every continuous function with values in Y can be uniformly approximated by sections of the kernel. We provide various characterizations of universal kernels and highlight them with several concrete examples of some practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles of functional analysis and especially the useful notion of vector measures which we describe in sufﬁcient detail to clarify our results.

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: The linear model with sparsity-favouring prior on the coefﬁcients has important applications in many different domains. In machine learning, most methods to date search for maximum a posteriori sparse solutions and neglect to represent posterior uncertainties. In this paper, we address problems of Bayesian optimal design (or experiment planning), for which accurate estimates of uncertainty are essential. To this end, we employ expectation propagation approximate inference for the linear model with Laplace prior, giving new insight into numerical stability properties and proposing a robust algorithm. We also show how to estimate model hyperparameters by empirical Bayesian maximisation of the marginal likelihood, and propose ideas in order to scale up the method to very large underdetermined problems. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on the application of gene regulatory network identiﬁcation from micro-array expression data, where both the Laplace prior and the active experimental design approach are shown to result in signiﬁcant improvements. We also address the problem of sparse coding of natural images, and show how our framework can be used for compressive sensing tasks. Part of this work appeared in Seeger et al. (2007b). The gene network identiﬁcation application appears in Steinke et al. (2007).

<p>Author: Manu Chhabra, Robert A. Jacobs</p><p>Abstract: The computational complexities arising in motor control can be ameliorated through the use of a library of motor synergies. We present a new model, referred to as the Greedy Additive Regression (GAR) model, for learning a library of torque sequences, and for learning the coefﬁcients of a linear combination of sequences minimizing a cost function. From the perspective of numerical optimization, the GAR model is interesting because it creates a library of “local features”—each sequence in the library is a solution to a single training task—and learns to combine these sequences using a local optimization procedure, namely, additive regression. We speculate that learners with local representational primitives and local optimization procedures will show good performance on nonlinear tasks. The GAR model is also interesting from the perspective of motor control because it outperforms several competing models. Results using a simulated two-joint arm suggest that the GAR model consistently shows excellent performance in the sense that it rapidly learns to perform novel, complex motor tasks. Moreover, its library is overcomplete and sparse, meaning that only a small fraction of the stored torque sequences are used when learning a new movement. The library is also robust in the sense that, after an initial training period, nearly all novel movements can be learned as additive combinations of sequences in the library, and in the sense that it shows good generalization when an arm’s dynamics are altered between training and test conditions, such as when a payload is added to the arm. Lastly, the GAR model works well regardless of whether motor tasks are speciﬁed in joint space or Cartesian space. We conclude that learning techniques using local primitives and optimization procedures are viable and potentially important methods for motor control and possibly other domains, and that these techniques deserve further examination by the artiﬁcial intelligence and cognitive science</p><p>6 0.43633342 <a title="58-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2008-Learning_to_Select_Features_using_their_Properties.html">54 jmlr-2008-Learning to Select Features using their Properties</a></p>

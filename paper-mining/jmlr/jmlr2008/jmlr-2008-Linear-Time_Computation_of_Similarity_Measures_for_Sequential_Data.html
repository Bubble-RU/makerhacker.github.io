<p>Author: Leonor Becerra-Bonache, Colin de la Higuera, Jean-Christophe Janodet, Frédéric Tantini</p><p>Abstract: When facing the question of learning languages in realistic settings, one has to tackle several problems that do not admit simple solutions. On the one hand, languages are usually deﬁned by complex grammatical mechanisms for which the learning results are predominantly negative, as the few algorithms are not really able to cope with noise. On the other hand, the learning settings themselves rely either on too simple information (text) or on unattainable one (query systems that do not exist in practice, nor can be simulated). We consider simple but sound classes of languages deﬁned via the widely used edit distance: the balls of strings. We propose to learn them with the help of a new sort of queries, called the correction queries: when a string is submitted to the Oracle, either she accepts it if it belongs to the target language, or she proposes a correction, that is, a string of the language close to the query with respect to the edit distance. We show that even if the good balls are not learnable in Angluin’s M AT model, they can be learned from a polynomial number of correction queries. Moreover, experimental evidence simulating a human Expert shows that this algorithm is resistant to approximate answers.

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Zach Jorgensen, Yan Zhou, Meador Inge</p><p>Abstract: Statistical spam ﬁlters are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. One of the more common adversarial attacks, known as the good word attack, thwarts spam ﬁlters by appending to spam messages sets of “good” words, which are words that are common in legitimate email but rare in spam. We present a counterattack strategy that attempts to differentiate spam from legitimate email in the input space by transforming each email into a bag of multiple segments, and subsequently applying multiple instance logistic regression on the bags. We treat each segment in the bag as an instance. An email is classiﬁed as spam if at least one instance in the corresponding bag is spam, and as legitimate if all the instances in it are legitimate. We show that a classiﬁer using our multiple instance counterattack strategy is more robust to good word attacks than its single instance counterpart and other single instance learners commonly used in the spam ﬁltering domain.

<p>Author: Andreas Maurer</p><p>Abstract: A method is introduced to learn and represent similarity with linear operators in kernel induced Hilbert spaces. Transferring error bounds for vector valued large-margin classiﬁers to the setting of Hilbert-Schmidt operators leads to dimension free bounds on a risk functional for linear representations and motivates a regularized objective functional. Minimization of this objective is effected by a simple technique of stochastic gradient descent. The resulting representations are tested on transfer problems in image processing, involving plane and spatial geometric invariants, handwritten characters and face recognition.

<p>Author: Christian Igel, Verena Heidrich-Meisner, Tobias Glasmachers</p><p>Abstract: SHARK is an object-oriented library for the design of adaptive systems. It comprises methods for single- and multi-objective optimization (e.g., evolutionary and gradient-based algorithms) as well as kernel-based methods, neural networks, and other machine learning techniques. Keywords: machine learning software, neural networks, kernel-methods, evolutionary algorithms, optimization, multi-objective-optimization 1. Overview SHARK is a modular C++ library for the design and optimization of adaptive systems. It serves as a toolbox for real world applications and basic research in computational intelligence and machine learning. The library provides methods for single- and multi-objective optimization, in particular evolutionary and gradient-based algorithms, kernel-based learning methods, neural networks, and many other machine learning techniques. Its main design criteria are ﬂexibility and speed. Here we restrict the description of SHARK to its core components, albeit the library contains plenty of additional functionality. Further information can be obtained from the HTML documentation and tutorials. More than 60 illustrative example programs serve as starting points for using SHARK. 2. Basic Tools—Rng, Array, and LinAlg The library provides general auxiliary functions and data structures for the development of machine learning algorithms. The Rng module generates reproducible and platform independent sequences of pseudo random numbers, which can be drawn from 14 predeﬁned discrete and continuous parametric distributions. The Array class provides dynamical array templates of arbitrary type and dimension as well as basic operations acting on these templates. LinAlg implements linear algebra algorithms such as matrix inversion and singular value decomposition. 3. ReClaM—Regression and Classiﬁcation Methods The goal of the ReClaM module is to provide machine learning algorithms for supervised classiﬁcation and regression in a uniﬁed, modular framework. It is built like a construction kit, where the main building blocks are adaptive data processing models, error functions, and optimization c 2008 Christian Igel, Verena Heidrich-Meisner and Tobias Glasmachers.

The basis for comparison is embedding of sequences using a formal language, such as a set of natural words, k-grams or all contiguous subsequences. As realizations of the framework we provide linear-time algorithms of different complexity and capabilities using sorted arrays, tries and sufﬁx trees as underlying data structures. Experiments on data sets from bioinformatics, text processing and computer security illustrate the efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms—enabling peak performances of up to 106 pairwise comparisons per second. The utility of distances and non-metric similarity measures for sequences as alternatives to string kernels is demonstrated in applications of text categorization, network intrusion detection and transcription site recognition in DNA.

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Alain Rakotomamonjy, Francis R. Bach, Stéphane Canu, Yves Grandvalet</p><p>Abstract: Multiple kernel learning (MKL) aims at simultaneously learning a kernel and the associated predictor in supervised learning settings. For the support vector machine, an efﬁcient and general multiple kernel learning algorithm, based on semi-inﬁnite linear programming, has been recently proposed. This approach has opened new perspectives since it makes MKL tractable for large-scale problems, by iteratively using existing support vector machine code. However, it turns out that this iterative algorithm needs numerous iterations for converging towards a reasonable solution. In this paper, we address the MKL problem through a weighted 2-norm regularization formulation with an additional constraint on the weights that encourages sparse kernel combinations. Apart from learning the combination, we solve a standard SVM optimization problem, where the kernel is deﬁned as a linear combination of multiple kernels. We propose an algorithm, named SimpleMKL, for solving this MKL problem and provide a new insight on MKL algorithms based on mixed-norm regularization by showing that the two approaches are equivalent. We show how SimpleMKL can be applied beyond binary classiﬁcation, for problems like regression, clustering (one-class classiﬁcation) or multiclass classiﬁcation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm converges rapidly and that its efﬁciency compares favorably to other MKL algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of MKL for some regressors based on wavelet kernels and on some model selection problems related to multiclass classiﬁcation problems.

<p>Author: Andrea Caponnetto, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil, Yiming Ying</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces HK of functions from an input space into a Hilbert space Y , an environment appropriate for multi-task learning. The reproducing kernel K associated to HK has its values as operators on Y . Our primary goal here is to derive conditions which ensure that the kernel K is universal. This means that on every compact subset of the input space, every continuous function with values in Y can be uniformly approximated by sections of the kernel. We provide various characterizations of universal kernels and highlight them with several concrete examples of some practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles of functional analysis and especially the useful notion of vector measures which we describe in sufﬁcient detail to clarify our results.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We propose a highly efﬁcient framework for penalized likelihood kernel methods applied to multiclass models with a large, structured set of classes. As opposed to many previous approaches which try to decompose the ﬁtting problem into many smaller ones, we focus on a Newton optimization of the complete model, making use of model structure and linear conjugate gradients in order to approximate Newton search directions. Crucially, our learning method is based entirely on matrix-vector multiplication primitives with the kernel matrices and their derivatives, allowing straightforward specialization to new kernels, and focusing code optimization efforts to these primitives only. Kernel parameters are learned automatically, by maximizing the cross-validation log likelihood in a gradient-based way, and predictive probabilities are estimated. We demonstrate our approach on large scale text classiﬁcation tasks with hierarchical structure on thousands of classes, achieving state-of-the-art results in an order of magnitude less time than previous work.

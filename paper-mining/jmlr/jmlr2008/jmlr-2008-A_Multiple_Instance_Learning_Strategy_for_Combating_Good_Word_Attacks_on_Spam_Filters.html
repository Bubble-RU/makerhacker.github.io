<p>Author: Shann-Ching Chen, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Robert F. Murphy</p><p>Abstract: In structured classiﬁcation problems, there is a direct conﬂict between expressive models and efﬁcient inference: while graphical models such as Markov random ﬁelds or factor graphs can represent arbitrary dependences among instance labels, the cost of inference via belief propagation in these models grows rapidly as the graph structure becomes more complicated. One important source of complexity in belief propagation is the need to marginalize large factors to compute messages. This operation takes time exponential in the number of variables in the factor, and can limit the expressiveness of the models we can use. In this paper, we study a new class of potential functions, which we call decomposable k-way potentials, and provide efﬁcient algorithms for computing messages from these potentials during belief propagation. We believe these new potentials provide a good balance between expressive power and efﬁcient inference in practical structured classiﬁcation problems. We discuss three instances of decomposable potentials: the associative Markov network potential, the nested junction tree, and a new type of potential which we call the voting potential. We use these potentials to classify images of protein subcellular location patterns in groups of cells. Classifying subcellular location patterns can help us answer many important questions in computational biology, including questions about how various treatments affect the synthesis and behavior of proteins and networks of proteins within a cell. Our new representation and algorithm lead to substantial improvements in both inference speed and classiﬁcation accuracy.

<p>Author: Konrad Rieck, Pavel Laskov</p><p>Abstract: Efﬁcient and expressive comparison of sequences is an essential procedure for learning with sequential data. In this article we propose a generic framework for computation of similarity measures for sequences, covering various kernel, distance and non-metric similarity functions. The basis for comparison is embedding of sequences using a formal language, such as a set of natural words, k-grams or all contiguous subsequences. As realizations of the framework we provide linear-time algorithms of different complexity and capabilities using sorted arrays, tries and sufﬁx trees as underlying data structures. Experiments on data sets from bioinformatics, text processing and computer security illustrate the efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms—enabling peak performances of up to 106 pairwise comparisons per second. The utility of distances and non-metric similarity measures for sequences as alternatives to string kernels is demonstrated in applications of text categorization, network intrusion detection and transcription site recognition in DNA.

<p>Author: Avraham Bab, Ronen I. Brafman</p><p>Abstract: Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has received continually growing attention in the past decade. Many algorithms that vary in their approaches to the different subtasks of MARL have been developed. However, the theoretical convergence results for these algorithms do not give a clue as to their practical performance nor supply insights to the dynamics of the learning process itself. This work is a comprehensive empirical study conducted on MGS, a simulation system developed for this purpose. It surveys the important algorithms in the ﬁeld, demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches to MARL through application of FriendQ, OAL, WoLF, FoeQ, Rmax, and other algorithms to a variety of fully cooperative and fully competitive domains in self and heterogeneous play, and supplies an informal analysis of the resulting learning processes. The results can aid in the design of new learning algorithms, in matching existing algorithms to speciﬁc tasks, and may guide further research and formal analysis of the learning processes.

<p>Author: Yonatan Amit, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe and analyze an algorithmic framework for online classiﬁcation where each online trial consists of multiple prediction tasks that are tied together. We tackle the problem of updating the online predictor by deﬁning a projection problem in which each prediction task corresponds to a single linear constraint. These constraints are tied together through a single slack parameter. We then introduce a general method for approximately solving the problem by projecting simultaneously and independently on each constraint which corresponds to a prediction sub-problem, and then averaging the individual solutions. We show that this approach constitutes a feasible, albeit not necessarily optimal, solution of the original projection problem. We derive concrete simultaneous projection schemes and analyze them in the mistake bound model. We demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithm in experiments with synthetic data and with multiclass text categorization tasks.

We show that a classiﬁer using our multiple instance counterattack strategy is more robust to good word attacks than its single instance counterpart and other single instance learners commonly used in the spam ﬁltering domain.

<p>Author: Michiel Debruyne, Mia Hubert, Johan A.K. Suykens</p><p>Abstract: Recent results about the robustness of kernel methods involve the analysis of inﬂuence functions. By deﬁnition the inﬂuence function is closely related to leave-one-out criteria. In statistical learning, the latter is often used to assess the generalization of a method. In statistics, the inﬂuence function is used in a similar way to analyze the statistical efﬁciency of a method. Links between both worlds are explored. The inﬂuence function is related to the ﬁrst term of a Taylor expansion. Higher order inﬂuence functions are calculated. A recursive relation between these terms is found characterizing the full Taylor expansion. It is shown how to evaluate inﬂuence functions at a speciﬁc sample distribution to obtain an approximation of the leave-one-out error. A speciﬁc implementation is proposed using a L1 loss in the selection of the hyperparameters and a Huber loss in the estimation procedure. The parameter in the Huber loss controlling the degree of robustness is optimized as well. The resulting procedure gives good results, even when outliers are present in the data.

<p>Author: Andreas Christmann, Arnout Van Messem</p><p>Abstract: We investigate robustness properties for a broad class of support vector machines with non-smooth loss functions. These kernel methods are inspired by convex risk minimization in inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Leading examples are the support vector machine based on the ε-insensitive loss function, and kernel based quantile regression based on the pinball loss function. Firstly, we propose with the Bouligand inﬂuence function (BIF) a modiﬁcation of F.R. Hampel’s inﬂuence function. The BIF has the advantage of being positive homogeneous which is in general not true for Hampel’s inﬂuence function. Secondly, we show that many support vector machines based on a Lipschitz continuous loss function and a bounded kernel have a bounded BIF and are thus robust in the sense of robust statistics based on inﬂuence functions.

<p>Author: Thomas G. Dietterich, Guohua Hao, Adam Ashenfelter</p><p>Abstract: Conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs) provide a ﬂexible and powerful model for sequence labeling problems. However, existing learning algorithms are slow, particularly in problems with large numbers of potential input features and feature combinations. This paper describes a new algorithm for training CRFs via gradient tree boosting. In tree boosting, the CRF potential functions are represented as weighted sums of regression trees, which provide compact representations of feature interactions. So the algorithm does not explicitly consider the potentially large parameter space. As a result, gradient tree boosting scales linearly in the order of the Markov model and in the order of the feature interactions, rather than exponentially as in previous algorithms based on iterative scaling and gradient descent. Gradient tree boosting also makes it possible to use instance weighting (as in C4.5) and surrogate splitting (as in CART) to handle missing values. Experimental studies of the effectiveness of these two methods (as well as standard imputation and indicator feature methods) show that instance weighting is the best method in most cases when feature values are missing at random.

<p>Author: Andrea Caponnetto, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil, Yiming Ying</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces HK of functions from an input space into a Hilbert space Y , an environment appropriate for multi-task learning. The reproducing kernel K associated to HK has its values as operators on Y . Our primary goal here is to derive conditions which ensure that the kernel K is universal. This means that on every compact subset of the input space, every continuous function with values in Y can be uniformly approximated by sections of the kernel. We provide various characterizations of universal kernels and highlight them with several concrete examples of some practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles of functional analysis and especially the useful notion of vector measures which we describe in sufﬁcient detail to clarify our results.

<p>Author: Giorgio Corani, Marco Zaffalon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, the naive credal classiﬁer, which is a set-valued counterpart of naive Bayes, is extended to a general and ﬂexible treatment of incomplete data, yielding a new classiﬁer called naive credal classiﬁer 2 (NCC2). The new classiﬁer delivers classiﬁcations that are reliable even in the presence of small sample sizes and missing values. Extensive empirical evaluations show that, by issuing set-valued classiﬁcations, NCC2 is able to isolate and properly deal with instances that are hard to classify (on which naive Bayes accuracy drops considerably), and to perform as well as naive Bayes on the other instances. The experiments point to a general problem: they show that with missing values, empirical evaluations may not reliably estimate the accuracy of a traditional classiﬁer, such as naive Bayes. This phenomenon adds even more value to the robust approach to classiﬁcation implemented by NCC2.

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Geremy Heitz, Gal Elidan, Pieter Abbeel, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning classiﬁers in structured domains, where some objects have a subset of features that are inherently absent due to complex relationships between the features. Unlike the case where a feature exists but its value is not observed, here we focus on the case where a feature may not even exist (structurally absent) for some of the samples. The common approach for handling missing features in discriminative models is to ﬁrst complete their unknown values, and then use a standard classiﬁcation procedure over the completed data. This paper focuses on features that are known to be non-existing, rather than have an unknown value. We show how incomplete data can be classiﬁed directly without any completion of the missing features using a max-margin learning framework. We formulate an objective function, based on the geometric interpretation of the margin, that aims to maximize the margin of each sample in its own relevant subspace. In this formulation, the linearly separable case can be transformed into a binary search over a series of second order cone programs (SOCP), a convex problem that can be solved efﬁciently. We also describe two approaches for optimizing the general case: an approximation that can be solved as a standard quadratic program (QP) and an iterative approach for solving the exact problem. By avoiding the pre-processing phase in which the data is completed, both of these approaches could offer considerable computational savings. More importantly, we show that the elegant handling of missing values by our approach allows it to both outperform other methods when the missing values have non-trivial structure, and be competitive with other methods when the values are missing at random. We demonstrate our results on several standard benchmarks and two real-world problems: edge prediction in metabolic pathways, and automobile detection in natural images.

<p>Author: Suhrid Balakrishnan, David Madigan</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁers favoring sparse solutions, such as support vector machines, relevance vector machines, LASSO-regression based classiﬁers, etc., provide competitive methods for classiﬁcation problems in high dimensions. However, current algorithms for training sparse classiﬁers typically scale quite unfavorably with respect to the number of training examples. This paper proposes online and multipass algorithms for training sparse linear classiﬁers for high dimensional data. These algorithms have computational complexity and memory requirements that make learning on massive data sets feasible. The central idea that makes this possible is a straightforward quadratic approximation to the likelihood function.

<p>Author: Thomas G. Dietterich, Guohua Hao, Adam Ashenfelter</p><p>Abstract: Conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs) provide a ﬂexible and powerful model for sequence labeling problems. However, existing learning algorithms are slow, particularly in problems with large numbers of potential input features and feature combinations. This paper describes a new algorithm for training CRFs via gradient tree boosting. In tree boosting, the CRF potential functions are represented as weighted sums of regression trees, which provide compact representations of feature interactions. So the algorithm does not explicitly consider the potentially large parameter space. As a result, gradient tree boosting scales linearly in the order of the Markov model and in the order of the feature interactions, rather than exponentially as in previous algorithms based on iterative scaling and gradient descent. Gradient tree boosting also makes it possible to use instance weighting (as in C4.5) and surrogate splitting (as in CART) to handle missing values. Experimental studies of the effectiveness of these two methods (as well as standard imputation and indicator feature methods) show that instance weighting is the best method in most cases when feature values are missing at random.

<p>Author: Elena Marchiori</p><p>Abstract: In supervised learning, a training set consisting of labeled instances is used by a learning algorithm for generating a model (classiﬁer) that is subsequently employed for deciding the class label of new instances (for generalization). Characteristics of the training set, such as presence of noisy instances and size, inﬂuence the learning algorithm and affect generalization performance. This paper introduces a new network-based representation of a training set, called hit miss network (HMN), which provides a compact description of the nearest neighbor relation over pairs of instances from each pair of classes. We show that structural properties of HMN’s correspond to properties of training points related to the one nearest neighbor (1-NN) decision rule, such as being border or central point. This motivates us to use HMN’s for improving the performance of a 1-NN classiﬁer by removing instances from the training set (instance selection). We introduce three new HMN-based algorithms for instance selection. HMN-C, which removes instances without affecting accuracy of 1-NN on the original training set, HMN-E, based on a more aggressive storage reduction, and HMN-EI, which applies iteratively HMN-E. Their performance is assessed on 22 data sets with different characteristics, such as input dimension, cardinality, class balance, number of classes, noise content, and presence of redundant variables. Results of experiments on these data sets show that accuracy of 1-NN classiﬁer increases signiﬁcantly when HMN-EI is applied. Comparison with state-of-the-art editing algorithms for instance selection on these data sets indicates best generalization performance of HMN-EI and no signiﬁcant difference in storage requirements. In general, these results indicate that HMN’s provide a powerful graph-based representation of a training set, which can be successfully applied for performing noise and redundance reduction in instance-based learning.

<p>Author: Giorgio Corani, Marco Zaffalon</p><p>Abstract: JNCC2 implements the naive credal classiﬁer 2 (NCC2). This is an extension of naive Bayes to imprecise probabilities that aims at delivering robust classiﬁcations also when dealing with small or incomplete data sets. Robustness is achieved by delivering set-valued classiﬁcations (that is, returning multiple classes) on the instances for which (i) the learning set is not informative enough to smooth the effect of choice of the prior density or (ii) the uncertainty arising from missing data prevents the reliable indication of a single class. JNCC2 is released under the GNU GPL license.

<p>Author: Giorgio Corani, Marco Zaffalon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, the naive credal classiﬁer, which is a set-valued counterpart of naive Bayes, is extended to a general and ﬂexible treatment of incomplete data, yielding a new classiﬁer called naive credal classiﬁer 2 (NCC2). The new classiﬁer delivers classiﬁcations that are reliable even in the presence of small sample sizes and missing values. Extensive empirical evaluations show that, by issuing set-valued classiﬁcations, NCC2 is able to isolate and properly deal with instances that are hard to classify (on which naive Bayes accuracy drops considerably), and to perform as well as naive Bayes on the other instances. The experiments point to a general problem: they show that with missing values, empirical evaluations may not reliably estimate the accuracy of a traditional classiﬁer, such as naive Bayes. This phenomenon adds even more value to the robust approach to classiﬁcation implemented by NCC2.

<p>Author: Andrea Caponnetto, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil, Yiming Ying</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces HK of functions from an input space into a Hilbert space Y , an environment appropriate for multi-task learning. The reproducing kernel K associated to HK has its values as operators on Y . Our primary goal here is to derive conditions which ensure that the kernel K is universal. This means that on every compact subset of the input space, every continuous function with values in Y can be uniformly approximated by sections of the kernel. We provide various characterizations of universal kernels and highlight them with several concrete examples of some practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles of functional analysis and especially the useful notion of vector measures which we describe in sufﬁcient detail to clarify our results.

<p>Author: Vojtěch Franc, Bogdan Savchynskyy</p><p>Abstract: The max-sum classiﬁer predicts n-tuple of labels from n-tuple of observable variables by maximizing a sum of quality functions deﬁned over neighbouring pairs of labels and observable variables. Predicting labels as MAP assignments of a Random Markov Field is a particular example of the max-sum classiﬁer. Learning parameters of the max-sum classiﬁer is a challenging problem because even computing the response of such classiﬁer is NP-complete in general. Estimating parameters using the Maximum Likelihood approach is feasible only for a subclass of max-sum classiﬁers with an acyclic structure of neighbouring pairs. Recently, the discriminative methods represented by the perceptron and the Support Vector Machines, originally designed for binary linear classiﬁers, have been extended for learning some subclasses of the max-sum classiﬁer. Besides the max-sum classiﬁers with the acyclic neighbouring structure, it has been shown that the discriminative learning is possible even with arbitrary neighbouring structure provided the quality functions fulﬁll some additional constraints. In this article, we extend the discriminative approach to other three classes of max-sum classiﬁers with an arbitrary neighbourhood structure. We derive learning algorithms for two subclasses of max-sum classiﬁers whose response can be computed in polynomial time: (i) the max-sum classiﬁers with supermodular quality functions and (ii) the max-sum classiﬁers whose response can be computed exactly by a linear programming relaxation. Moreover, we show that the learning problem can be approximately solved even for a general max-sum classiﬁer.

<p>Author: Jiji Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Causal reasoning is primarily concerned with what would happen to a system under external interventions. In particular, we are often interested in predicting the probability distribution of some random variables that would result if some other variables were forced to take certain values. One prominent approach to tackling this problem is based on causal Bayesian networks, using directed acyclic graphs as causal diagrams to relate post-intervention probabilities to pre-intervention probabilities that are estimable from observational data. However, such causal diagrams are seldom fully testable given observational data. In consequence, many causal discovery algorithms based on data-mining can only output an equivalence class of causal diagrams (rather than a single one). This paper is concerned with causal reasoning given an equivalence class of causal diagrams, represented by a (partial) ancestral graph. We present two main results. The ﬁrst result extends Pearl (1995)’s celebrated do-calculus to the context of ancestral graphs. In the second result, we focus on a key component of Pearl’s calculus—the property of invariance under interventions, and give stronger graphical conditions for this property than those implied by the ﬁrst result. The second result also improves the earlier, similar results due to Spirtes et al. (1993).

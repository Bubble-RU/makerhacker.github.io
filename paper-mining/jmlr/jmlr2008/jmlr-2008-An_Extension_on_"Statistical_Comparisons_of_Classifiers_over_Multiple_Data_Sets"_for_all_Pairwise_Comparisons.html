<p>Author: Tzu-Kuo Huang, Chih-Jen Lin, Ruby C. Weng</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes new approaches to rank individuals from their group comparison results. Many real-world problems are of this type. For example, ranking players from team comparisons is important in some sports. In machine learning, a closely related application is classiﬁcation using coding matrices. Group comparison results are usually in two types: binary indicator outcomes (wins/losses) or measured outcomes (scores). For each type of results, we propose new models for estimating individuals’ abilities, and hence a ranking of individuals. The estimation is carried out by solving convex minimization problems, for which we develop easy and efﬁcient solution procedures.

<p>Author: Bo Jiang, Xuegong Zhang, Tianxi Cai</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most popular and promising classiﬁcation algorithms. After a classiﬁcation rule is constructed via the SVM, it is essential to evaluate its prediction accuracy. In this paper, we develop procedures for obtaining both point and interval estimators for the prediction error. Under mild regularity conditions, we derive the consistency and asymptotic normality of the prediction error estimators for SVM with ﬁnite-dimensional kernels. A perturbationresampling procedure is proposed to obtain interval estimates for the prediction error in practice. With numerical studies on simulated data and a benchmark repository, we recommend the use of interval estimates centered at the cross-validated point estimates for the prediction error. Further applications of the proposed procedure in model evaluation and feature selection are illustrated with two examples.

<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Marten H. Wegkamp</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of binary classiﬁcation where the classiﬁer can, for a particular cost, choose not to classify an observation. Just as in the conventional classiﬁcation problem, minimization of the sample average of the cost is a difﬁcult optimization problem. As an alternative, we propose the optimization of a certain convex loss function φ, analogous to the hinge loss used in support vector machines (SVMs). Its convexity ensures that the sample average of this surrogate loss can be efﬁciently minimized. We study its statistical properties. We show that minimizing the expected surrogate loss—the φ-risk—also minimizes the risk. We also study the rate at which the φ-risk approaches its minimum value. We show that fast rates are possible when the conditional probability P(Y = 1|X) is unlikely to be close to certain critical values.

<p>Author: Hsuan-Tien Lin, Ling Li</p><p>Abstract: Ensemble learning algorithms such as boosting can achieve better performance by averaging over the predictions of some base hypotheses. Nevertheless, most existing algorithms are limited to combining only a ﬁnite number of hypotheses, and the generated ensemble is usually sparse. Thus, it is not clear whether we should construct an ensemble classiﬁer with a larger or even an inﬁnite number of hypotheses. In addition, constructing an inﬁnite ensemble itself is a challenging task. In this paper, we formulate an inﬁnite ensemble learning framework based on the support vector machine (SVM). The framework can output an inﬁnite and nonsparse ensemble through embedding inﬁnitely many hypotheses into an SVM kernel. We use the framework to derive two novel kernels, the stump kernel and the perceptron kernel. The stump kernel embodies inﬁnitely many decision stumps, and the perceptron kernel embodies inﬁnitely many perceptrons. We also show that the Laplacian radial basis function kernel embodies inﬁnitely many decision trees, and can thus be explained through inﬁnite ensemble learning. Experimental results show that SVM with these kernels is superior to boosting with the same base hypothesis set. In addition, SVM with the stump kernel or the perceptron kernel performs similarly to SVM with the Gaussian radial basis function kernel, but enjoys the beneﬁt of faster parameter selection. These properties make the novel kernels favorable choices in practice.

<p>Author: Laurens van der Maaten, Geoffrey Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We present a new technique called “t-SNE” that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces signiﬁcantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to inﬂuence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are signiﬁcantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.

<p>Author: Gemma C. Garriga, Petra Kralj, Nada Lavrač</p><p>Abstract: Closed sets have been proven successful in the context of compacted data representation for association rule learning. However, their use is mainly descriptive, dealing only with unlabeled data. This paper shows that when considering labeled data, closed sets can be adapted for classiﬁcation and discrimination purposes by conveniently contrasting covering properties on positive and negative examples. We formally prove that these sets characterize the space of relevant combinations of features for discriminating the target class. In practice, identifying relevant/irrelevant combinations of features through closed sets is useful in many applications: to compact emerging patterns of typical descriptive mining applications, to reduce the number of essential rules in classiﬁcation, and to efﬁciently learn subgroup descriptions, as demonstrated in real-life subgroup discovery experiments on a high dimensional microarray data set.

<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information of a supervised learning problem is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem in the sense that it can asymptotically represent the function to be learned and is sufﬁciently smooth. Thus, kernels do not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economical use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and (3) to denoise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results.

<p>Author: Tzu-Kuo Huang, Chih-Jen Lin, Ruby C. Weng</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes new approaches to rank individuals from their group comparison results. Many real-world problems are of this type. For example, ranking players from team comparisons is important in some sports. In machine learning, a closely related application is classiﬁcation using coding matrices. Group comparison results are usually in two types: binary indicator outcomes (wins/losses) or measured outcomes (scores). For each type of results, we propose new models for estimating individuals’ abilities, and hence a ranking of individuals. The estimation is carried out by solving convex minimization problems, for which we develop easy and efﬁcient solution procedures. Experiments on real bridge records and multi-class classiﬁcation demonstrate the viability of the proposed models.

<p>Author: Matthias W. Seeger</p><p>Abstract: The linear model with sparsity-favouring prior on the coefﬁcients has important applications in many different domains. In machine learning, most methods to date search for maximum a posteriori sparse solutions and neglect to represent posterior uncertainties. In this paper, we address problems of Bayesian optimal design (or experiment planning), for which accurate estimates of uncertainty are essential. To this end, we employ expectation propagation approximate inference for the linear model with Laplace prior, giving new insight into numerical stability properties and proposing a robust algorithm. We also show how to estimate model hyperparameters by empirical Bayesian maximisation of the marginal likelihood, and propose ideas in order to scale up the method to very large underdetermined problems. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on the application of gene regulatory network identiﬁcation from micro-array expression data, where both the Laplace prior and the active experimental design approach are shown to result in signiﬁcant improvements. We also address the problem of sparse coding of natural images, and show how our framework can be used for compressive sensing tasks. Part of this work appeared in Seeger et al. (2007b). The gene network identiﬁcation application appears in Steinke et al. (2007).

<p>Author: Abraham George, Warren B. Powell, Sanjeev R. Kulkarni</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the value of a multiattribute resource, where the attributes are categorical or discrete in nature and the number of potential attribute vectors is very large. The problem arises in approximate dynamic programming when we need to estimate the value of a multiattribute resource from estimates based on Monte-Carlo simulation. These problems have been traditionally solved using aggregation, but choosing the right level of aggregation requires resolving the classic tradeoff between aggregation error and sampling error. We propose a method that estimates the value of a resource at different levels of aggregation simultaneously, and then uses a weighted combination of the estimates. Using the optimal weights, which minimizes the variance of the estimate while accounting for correlations between the estimates, is computationally too expensive for practical applications. We have found that a simple inverse variance formula (adjusted for bias), which effectively assumes the estimates are independent, produces near-optimal estimates. We use the setting of two levels of aggregation to explain why this approximation works so well.

<p>Author: Jiji Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Causal reasoning is primarily concerned with what would happen to a system under external interventions. In particular, we are often interested in predicting the probability distribution of some random variables that would result if some other variables were forced to take certain values. One prominent approach to tackling this problem is based on causal Bayesian networks, using directed acyclic graphs as causal diagrams to relate post-intervention probabilities to pre-intervention probabilities that are estimable from observational data. However, such causal diagrams are seldom fully testable given observational data. In consequence, many causal discovery algorithms based on data-mining can only output an equivalence class of causal diagrams (rather than a single one). This paper is concerned with causal reasoning given an equivalence class of causal diagrams, represented by a (partial) ancestral graph. We present two main results. The ﬁrst result extends Pearl (1995)’s celebrated do-calculus to the context of ancestral graphs. In the second result, we focus on a key component of Pearl’s calculus—the property of invariance under interventions, and give stronger graphical conditions for this property than those implied by the ﬁrst result. The second result also improves the earlier, similar results due to Spirtes et al. (1993).

<p>Author: Eric Bax, Augusto Callejas</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new PAC transductive error bound for classiﬁcation. The method uses information from the training examples and inputs of working examples to develop a set of likely assignments to outputs of the working examples. A likely assignment with maximum error determines the bound. The method is very effective for small data sets.

<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Zaiqing Nie, Bo Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen</p><p>Abstract: Existing template-independent web data extraction approaches adopt highly ineffective decoupled strategies—attempting to do data record detection and attribute labeling in two separate phases. In this paper, we propose an integrated web data extraction paradigm with hierarchical models. The proposed model is called Dynamic Hierarchical Markov Random Fields (DHMRFs). DHMRFs take structural uncertainty into consideration and deﬁne a joint distribution of both model structure and class labels. The joint distribution is an exponential family distribution. As a conditional model, DHMRFs relax the independence assumption as made in directed models. Since exact inference is intractable, a variational method is developed to learn the model’s parameters and to ﬁnd the MAP model structure and label assignments. We apply DHMRFs to a real-world web data extraction task. Experimental results show that: (1) integrated web data extraction models can achieve signiﬁcant improvements on both record detection and attribute labeling compared to decoupled models; (2) in diverse web data extraction DHMRFs can potentially address the blocky artifact issue which is suffered by ﬁxed-structured hierarchical models.

<p>Author: Jorge Jambeiro Filho, Jacques Wainer</p><p>Abstract: We replaced the conditional probability tables of Bayesian network nodes whose parents have high cardinality with a multilevel empirical hierarchical Bayesian model called hierarchical pattern Bayes (HPB).1 The resulting Bayesian networks achieved signiÄ?Ĺš cant performance improvements over Bayesian networks with the same structure and traditional conditional probability tables, over Bayesian networks with simpler structures like naĂ&sbquo;Â¨ve Bayes and tree augmented naĂ&sbquo;Â¨ve Bayes, over Ă&bdquo;Ä&hellip; Ă&bdquo;Ä&hellip; Bayesian networks where traditional conditional probability tables were substituted by noisy-OR gates, default tables, decision trees and decision graphs and over Bayesian networks constructed after a cardinality reduction preprocessing phase using the agglomerative information bottleneck method. Our main tests took place in important fraud detection domains, which are characterized by the presence of high cardinality attributes and by the existence of relevant interactions among them. Other tests, over UCI data sets, show that HPB may have a quite wide applicability.

<p>Author: Kun Zhang, Laiwan Chan</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that solutions to the nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) problem are highly non-unique. In this paper we propose the “minimal nonlinear distortion” (MND) principle for tackling the ill-posedness of nonlinear ICA problems. MND prefers the nonlinear ICA solution with the estimated mixing procedure as close as possible to linear, among all possible solutions. It also helps to avoid local optima in the solutions. To achieve MND, we exploit a regularization term to minimize the mean square error between the nonlinear mixing mapping and the best-ﬁtting linear one. The effect of MND on the inherent trivial and non-trivial indeterminacies in nonlinear ICA solutions is investigated. Moreover, we show that local MND is closely related to the smoothness regularizer penalizing large curvature, which provides another useful regularization condition for nonlinear ICA. Experiments on synthetic data show the usefulness of the MND principle for separating various nonlinear mixtures. Finally, as an application, we use nonlinear ICA with MND to separate daily returns of a set of stocks in Hong Kong, and the linear causal relations among them are successfully discovered. The resulting causal relations give some interesting insights into the stock market. Such a result can not be achieved by linear ICA. Simulation studies also verify that when doing causality discovery, sometimes one should not ignore the nonlinear distortion in the data generation procedure, even if it is weak.

<p>Author: Amit Dhurandhar, Alin Dobra</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we use the methodology introduced by Dhurandhar and Dobra (2009) for analyzing the error of classiﬁers and the model selection measures, to analyze decision tree algorithms. The methodology consists of obtaining parametric expressions for the moments of the generalization error (GE) for the classiﬁcation model of interest, followed by plotting these expressions for interpretability. The major challenge in applying the methodology to decision trees, the main theme of this work, is customizing the generic expressions for the moments of GE to this particular classiﬁcation algorithm. The speciﬁc contributions we make in this paper are: (a) we primarily characterize a subclass of decision trees namely, Random decision trees, (b) we discuss how the analysis extends to other decision tree algorithms and (c) in order to extend the analysis to certain model selection measures, we generalize the relationships between the moments of GE and moments of the model selection measures given in (Dhurandhar and Dobra, 2009) to randomized classiﬁcation algorithms. An empirical comparison of the proposed method with Monte Carlo and distribution free bounds obtained using Breiman’s formula, depicts the advantages of the method in terms of running time and accuracy. It thus showcases the use of the deployed methodology as an exploratory tool to study learning algorithms.

<p>Author: Imhoi Koo, Rhee Man Kil</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new method of model selection for regression problems using the modulus of continuity. For this purpose, we suggest the prediction risk bounds of regression models using the modulus of continuity which can be interpreted as the complexity of functions. We also present the model selection criterion referred to as the modulus of continuity information criterion (MCIC) which is derived from the suggested prediction risk bounds. The suggested MCIC provides a risk estimate using the modulus of continuity for a trained regression model (or an estimation function) while other model selection criteria such as the AIC and BIC use structural information such as the number of training parameters. As a result, the suggested MCIC is able to discriminate the performances of trained regression models, even with the same structure of training models. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, the simulation for function approximation using the multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) was conducted. Through the simulation for function approximation, it was demonstrated that the suggested MCIC provides a good selection tool for nonlinear regression models, even with the limited size of data.

<p>Author: Jorge Jambeiro Filho, Jacques Wainer</p><p>Abstract: We replaced the conditional probability tables of Bayesian network nodes whose parents have high cardinality with a multilevel empirical hierarchical Bayesian model called hierarchical pattern Bayes (HPB).1 The resulting Bayesian networks achieved signiÄ?Ĺš cant performance improvements over Bayesian networks with the same structure and traditional conditional probability tables, over Bayesian networks with simpler structures like naĂ&sbquo;Â¨ve Bayes and tree augmented naĂ&sbquo;Â¨ve Bayes, over Ă&bdquo;Ä&hellip; Ă&bdquo;Ä&hellip; Bayesian networks where traditional conditional probability tables were substituted by noisy-OR gates, default tables, decision trees and decision graphs and over Bayesian networks constructed after a cardinality reduction preprocessing phase using the agglomerative information bottleneck method. Our main tests took place in important fraud detection domains, which are characterized by the presence of high cardinality attributes and by the existence of relevant interactions among them. Other tests, over UCI data sets, show that HPB may have a quite wide applicability.

<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2010-7-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume11/ben-haim10a/ben-haim10a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Yael Ben-Haim, Elad Tom-Tov</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for building decision tree classiﬁers. The algorithm is executed in a distributed environment and is especially designed for classifying large data sets and streaming data. It is empirically shown to be as accurate as a standard decision tree classiﬁer, while being scalable for processing of streaming data on multiple processors. These ﬁndings are supported by a rigorous analysis of the algorithm’s accuracy. The essence of the algorithm is to quickly construct histograms at the processors, which compress the data to a ﬁxed amount of memory. A master processor uses this information to ﬁnd near-optimal split points to terminal tree nodes. Our analysis shows that guarantees on the local accuracy of split points imply guarantees on the overall tree accuracy. Keywords: decision tree classiﬁers, distributed computing, streaming data, scalability</p><br/>

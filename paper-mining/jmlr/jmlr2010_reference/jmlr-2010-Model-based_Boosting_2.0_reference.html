The package implements boosting for optimizing general risk functions using component-wise (penalized) least squares estimates or regression trees as base-learners for ﬁtting generalized linear, additive and interaction models to potentially high-dimensional data. Keywords: component-wise functional gradient descent, splines, decision trees 1. Overview The R add-on package mboost (Hothorn et al., 2010) implements tools for ﬁtting and evaluating a variety of regression and classiﬁcation models that have been suggested in machine learning and statistics. Optimization within the empirical risk minimization framework is performed via a component-wise functional gradient descent algorithm. The algorithm originates from the statistical view on boosting algorithms (Friedman et al., 2000; Bühlmann and Yu, 2003). The theory and its implementation in mboost allow for ﬁtting complex prediction models, taking potentially many interactions of features into account, as well as for ﬁtting additive and linear models. The model class the package deals with is best described by so-called structured additive regression (STAR) models, where some characteristic ξ of the conditional distribution of a response variable Y given features X is modeled through a regression function f of the features ξ(Y |X = x) = f (x). In order to facilitate parsimonious and interpretable models, the regression function f is structured, that is, restricted to additive functions f (x) = ∑ p f j (x). Each model component f j (x) might take only j=1 c 2010 Torsten Hothorn, Peter Bühlmann, Thomas Kneib, Matthias Schmid and Benjamin Hofner.

Special cases are linear models f (x) = x⊤ β, additive models f (x) = ∑ p f j (x( j) ), where f j is a function of the jth feature x( j) only (smooth functions or j=1 stumps, for example) or a more complex function where f (x) is implicitly deﬁned as the sum of multiple decision trees including higher-order interactions. The latter case corresponds to boosting with trees. Combinations of these structures are also possible. The most important advantage of such a decomposition of the regression function is that each component of a ﬁtted model can be looked at and interpreted separately for gaining a better understanding of the model at hand. The characteristic ξ of the distribution depends on the measurement scale of the response Y and the scientiﬁc question to be answered. For binary or numeric variables, some function of the expectation may be appropriate, but also quantiles or expectiles may be interesting. The deﬁnition of ξ is determined by deﬁning a loss function ρ whose empirical risk is to be minimized under some algorithmic constraints (i.e., limited number of boosting iterations). The model is then ﬁtted using n p ( fˆ1 , . . . , fˆp ) = argmin ∑ wi ρ yi , ∑ f j (x) . ( f1 ,..., f p ) i=1 j=1 Here (yi , xi ), i = 1, . . . , n, are n training samples with responses yi and potentially high-dimensional feature vectors xi , and wi are some weights. The component-wise boosting algorithm starts with some offset for f and iteratively ﬁts residuals deﬁned by the negative gradient of the loss function evaluated at the current ﬁt by updating only the best model component in each iteration. The details have been described by Bühlmann and Yu (2003). Early stopping via resampling approaches or AIC leads to sparse models in the sense that only a subset of important model components f j deﬁnes the ﬁnal model. A more thorough introduction to boosting with applications in statistics based on version 1.0 of mboost is given by Bühlmann and Hothorn (2007). As of version 2.0, the package allows for ﬁtting models to binary, numeric, ordered and censored responses, that is, regression of the mean, robust regression, classiﬁcation (logistic and exponential loss), ordinal regression,1 quantile1 and expectile1 regression, censored regression (including Cox, Weibull1 , log-logistic1 or lognormal1 models) as well as Poisson and negative binomial regression1 for count data can be performed. Because the structure of the regression function f (x) can be chosen independently from the loss function ρ, interesting new models can be ﬁtted (e.g., in geoadditive regression, Kneib et al., 2009). 2. Design and Implementation The package incorporates an infrastructure for representing loss functions (so-called ‘families’), base-learners deﬁning the structure of the regression function and thus the model components f j , and a generic implementation of component-wise functional gradient descent. The main progress in version 2.0 is that only one implementation of the boosting algorithm is applied to all possible models (linear, additive, tree-based) and all families. Earlier versions were based on three implementations, one for linear models, one for additive models, and one for tree-based boosting. In comparison to the 1.0 series, the reduced code basis is easier to maintain, more robust and regression tests have been set-up in a more uniﬁed way. Speciﬁcally, the new code basis results in an enhanced and more user-friendly formula interface. In addition, convenience functions for hyperparameter selection, faster computation of predictions and improved visual model diagnostics are available. 1. Model family is new in version 2.0 or was added after the release of mboost 1.0. 2110 M ODEL - BASED B OOSTING 2.0 Currently implemented base-learners include component-wise linear models (where only one variable is updated in each iteration of the algorithm), additive models with quadratic penalties (e.g., for ﬁtting smooth functions via penalized splines, varying coefﬁcients or bi- and trivariate tensor product splines, Schmid and Hothorn, 2008), and trees. As a major improvement over the 1.0 series, computations on larger data sets (both with respect to the number of observations and the number of variables) are now facilitated by memory efﬁcient implementations of the base-learners, mostly by applying sparse matrix techniques (package Matrix, Bates and Mächler, 2009) and parallelization for a cross-validation-based choice of the number of boosting iterations (per default via package multicore, Urbanek, 2009). A more elaborate description of mboost 2.0 features is available from the mboost vignette.2 3. User Interface by Example We illustrate the main components of the user-interface by a small example on human body fat composition: Garcia et al. (2005) used a linear model for predicting body fat content by means of common anthropometric measurements that were obtained for n = 71 healthy German women. In addition, the women’s body composition was measured by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA). The aim is to describe the DXA measurements as a function of the anthropometric features. Here, we extend the linear model by i) an intrinsic variable selection via early stopping, ii) additional terms allowing for smooth deviations from linearity where necessary (by means of penalized splines orthogonalized to the linear effect, Kneib et al., 2009), iii) a possible interaction between two variables with known impact on body fat composition (hip and waist circumference) and iv) using a robust median regression approach instead of L2 risk. For the data (available as data frame bodyfat), the model structure is speciﬁed via a formula involving the base-learners corresponding to the different model components (linear terms: bols(); smooth terms: bbs(); interactions: btree()). The loss function (here, the check function for the 0.5 quantile) along with its negative gradient function are deﬁned by the QuantReg(0.5) family (Fenske et al., 2009). The model structure (speciﬁed using the formula fm), the data and the family are then passed to function mboost() for model ﬁtting:3 R> library(</p><br/>

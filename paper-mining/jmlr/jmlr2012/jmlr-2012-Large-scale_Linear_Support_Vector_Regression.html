<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Amr Ahmed, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: A supervised topic model can use side information such as ratings or labels associated with documents or images to discover more predictive low dimensional topical representations of the data. However, existing supervised topic models predominantly employ likelihood-driven objective functions for learning and inference, leaving the popular and potentially powerful max-margin principle unexploited for seeking predictive representations of data and more discriminative topic bases for the corpus. In this paper, we propose the maximum entropy discrimination latent Dirichlet allocation (MedLDA) model, which integrates the mechanism behind the max-margin prediction models (e.g., SVMs) with the mechanism behind the hierarchical Bayesian topic models (e.g., LDA) under a uniﬁed constrained optimization framework, and yields latent topical representations that are more discriminative and more suitable for prediction tasks such as document classiﬁcation or regression. The principle underlying the MedLDA formalism is quite general and can be applied for jointly max-margin and maximum likelihood learning of directed or undirected topic models when supervising side information is available. Efﬁcient variational methods for posterior inference and parameter estimation are derived and extensive empirical studies on several real data sets are also provided. Our experimental results demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that MedLDA could: 1) discover sparse and highly discriminative topical representations; 2) achieve state of the art prediction performance; and 3) be more efﬁcient than existing supervised topic models, especially for classiﬁcation.

<p>Author: Benedict C. May, Nathan Korda, Anthony Lee, David S. Leslie</p><p>Abstract: In sequential decision problems in an unknown environment, the decision maker often faces a dilemma over whether to explore to discover more about the environment, or to exploit current knowledge. We address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in a general setting encompassing both standard and contextualised bandit problems. The contextual bandit problem has recently resurfaced in attempts to maximise click-through rates in web based applications, a task with signiﬁcant commercial interest. In this article we consider an approach of Thompson (1933) which makes use of samples from the posterior distributions for the instantaneous value of each action. We extend the approach by introducing a new algorithm, Optimistic Bayesian Sampling (OBS), in which the probability of playing an action increases with the uncertainty in the estimate of the action value. This results in better directed exploratory behaviour. We prove that, under unrestrictive assumptions, both approaches result in optimal behaviour with respect to the average reward criterion of Yang and Zhu (2002). We implement OBS and measure its performance in simulated Bernoulli bandit and linear regression domains, and also when tested with the task of personalised news article recommendation on a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module data set. We ﬁnd that OBS performs competitively when compared to recently proposed benchmark algorithms and outperforms Thompson’s method throughout.

<p>Author: Aviv Tamar, Dotan Di Castro, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning an agent uses online feedback from the environment in order to adaptively select an effective policy. Model free approaches address this task by directly mapping environmental states to actions, while model based methods attempt to construct a model of the environment, followed by a selection of optimal actions based on that model. Given the complementary advantages of both approaches, we suggest a novel procedure which augments a model free algorithm with a partial model. The resulting hybrid algorithm switches between a model based and a model free mode, depending on the current state and the agent’s knowledge. Our method relies on a novel deﬁnition for a partially known model, and an estimator that incorporates such knowledge in order to reduce uncertainty in stochastic approximation iterations. We prove that such an approach leads to improved policy evaluation whenever environmental knowledge is available, without compromising performance when such knowledge is absent. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on policy gradient and Q-learning algorithms, and its usefulness in solving a call admission control problem.

<p>Author: Guo-Xun Yuan, Chia-Hua Ho, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Recently, Yuan et al. (2010) conducted a comprehensive comparison on software for L1-regularized classiﬁcation. They concluded that a carefully designed coordinate descent implementation CDN is the fastest among state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we point out that CDN is less competitive on loss functions that are expensive to compute. In particular, CDN for logistic regression is much slower than CDN for SVM because the logistic loss involves expensive exp/log operations. In optimization, Newton methods are known to have fewer iterations although each iteration costs more. Because solving the Newton sub-problem is independent of the loss calculation, this type of methods may surpass CDN under some circumstances. In L1-regularized classiﬁcation, GLMNET by Friedman et al. is already a Newton-type method, but experiments in Yuan et al. (2010) indicated that the existing GLMNET implementation may face difﬁculties for some largescale problems. In this paper, we propose an improved GLMNET to address some theoretical and implementation issues. In particular, as a Newton-type method, GLMNET achieves fast local convergence, but may fail to quickly obtain a useful solution. By a careful design to adjust the effort for each iteration, our method is efﬁcient for both loosely or strictly solving the optimization problem. Experiments demonstrate that our improved GLMNET is more efﬁcient than CDN for L1-regularized logistic regression.

<p>Author: Roland R. Ramsahai</p><p>Abstract: Conditional independence relations involving latent variables do not necessarily imply observable independences. They may imply inequality constraints on observable parameters and causal bounds, which can be used for falsiﬁcation and identiﬁcation. The literature on computing such constraints often involve a deterministic underlying data generating process in a counterfactual framework. If an analyst is ignorant of the nature of the underlying mechanisms then they may wish to use a model which allows the underlying mechanisms to be probabilistic. A method of computation for a weaker model without any determinism is given here and demonstrated for the instrumental variable model, though applicable to other models. The approach is based on the analysis of mappings with convex polytopes in a decision theoretic framework and can be implemented in readily available polyhedral computation software. Well known constraints and bounds are replicated in a probabilistic model and novel ones are computed for instrumental variable models without non-deterministic versions of the randomization, exclusion restriction and monotonicity assumptions respectively.

<p>Author: José Hernández-Orallo, Peter Flach, Cèsar Ferri</p><p>Abstract: Many performance metrics have been introduced in the literature for the evaluation of classiﬁcation performance, each of them with different origins and areas of application. These metrics include accuracy, unweighted accuracy, the area under the ROC curve or the ROC convex hull, the mean absolute error and the Brier score or mean squared error (with its decomposition into reﬁnement and calibration). One way of understanding the relations among these metrics is by means of variable operating conditions (in the form of misclassiﬁcation costs and/or class distributions). Thus, a metric may correspond to some expected loss over different operating conditions. One dimension for the analysis has been the distribution for this range of operating conditions, leading to some important connections in the area of proper scoring rules. We demonstrate in this paper that there is an equally important dimension which has so far received much less attention in the analysis of performance metrics. This dimension is given by the decision rule, which is typically implemented as a threshold choice method when using scoring models. In this paper, we explore many old and new threshold choice methods: ﬁxed, score-uniform, score-driven, rate-driven and optimal, among others. By calculating the expected loss obtained with these threshold choice methods for a uniform range of operating conditions we give clear interpretations of the 0-1 loss, the absolute error, the Brier score, the AUC and the reﬁnement loss respectively. Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of performance metrics as well as a systematic approach to loss minimisation which can be summarised as follows: given a model, apply the threshold choice methods that correspond with the available information about the operating condition, and compare their expected losses. In order to assist in this procedure we also derive several connections between the aforementioned performance metrics, and we highlight the role of calibra</p><p>same-paper 2 0.52998549 <a title="54-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2012-Large-scale_Linear_Support_Vector_Regression.html">54 jmlr-2012-Large-scale Linear Support Vector Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Chia-Hua Ho, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Support vector regression (SVR) and support vector classiﬁcation (SVC) are popular learning techniques, but their use with kernels is often time consuming. Recently, linear SVC without kernels has been shown to give competitive accuracy for some applications, but enjoys much faster training/testing. However, few studies have focused on linear SVR. In this paper, we extend state-of-theart training methods for linear SVC to linear SVR. We show that the extension is straightforward for some methods, but is not trivial for some others. Our experiments demonstrate that for some problems, the proposed linear-SVR training methods can very efﬁciently produce models that are as good as kernel SVR.

<p>Author: Guo-Xun Yuan, Chia-Hua Ho, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Recently, Yuan et al. (2010) conducted a comprehensive comparison on software for L1-regularized classiﬁcation. They concluded that a carefully designed coordinate descent implementation CDN is the fastest among state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we point out that CDN is less competitive on loss functions that are expensive to compute. In particular, CDN for logistic regression is much slower than CDN for SVM because the logistic loss involves expensive exp/log operations. In optimization, Newton methods are known to have fewer iterations although each iteration costs more. Because solving the Newton sub-problem is independent of the loss calculation, this type of methods may surpass CDN under some circumstances. In L1-regularized classiﬁcation, GLMNET by Friedman et al. is already a Newton-type method, but experiments in Yuan et al. (2010) indicated that the existing GLMNET implementation may face difﬁculties for some largescale problems. In this paper, we propose an improved GLMNET to address some theoretical and implementation issues. In particular, as a Newton-type method, GLMNET achieves fast local convergence, but may fail to quickly obtain a useful solution. By a careful design to adjust the effort for each iteration, our method is efﬁcient for both loosely or strictly solving the optimization problem. Experiments demonstrate that our improved GLMNET is more efﬁcient than CDN for L1-regularized logistic regression.

<p>Author: Blaine Nelson, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein, Ling Huang, Anthony D. Joseph, Steven J. Lee, Satish Rao, J. D. Tygar</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁers are often used to detect miscreant activities. We study how an adversary can systematically query a classiﬁer to elicit information that allows the attacker to evade detection while incurring a near-minimal cost of modifying their intended malfeasance. We generalize the theory of Lowd and Meek (2005) to the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers that partition their feature space into two sets, one of which is convex. We present query algorithms for this family that construct undetected instances of approximately minimal cost using only polynomially-many queries in the dimension of the space and in the level of approximation. Our results demonstrate that nearoptimal evasion can be accomplished for this family without reverse engineering the classiﬁer’s decision boundary. We also consider general ℓ p costs and show that near-optimal evasion on the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers is generally efﬁcient for both positive and negative convexity for all levels of approximation if p = 1.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Claudio Gentile, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: We present a new online learning algorithm in the selective sampling framework, where labels must be actively queried before they are revealed. We prove bounds on the regret of our algorithm and on the number of labels it queries when faced with an adaptive adversarial strategy of generating the instances. Our bounds both generalize and strictly improve over previous bounds in similar settings. Additionally, our selective sampling algorithm can be converted into an efﬁcient statistical active learning algorithm. We extend our algorithm and analysis to the multiple-teacher setting, where the algorithm can choose which subset of teachers to query for each label. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques on a real-world Internet search problem.

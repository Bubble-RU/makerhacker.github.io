<p>Author: Chunhua Shen, Junae Kim, Lei Wang, Anton van den Hengel</p><p>Abstract: The success of many machine learning and pattern recognition methods relies heavily upon the identiﬁcation of an appropriate distance metric on the input data. It is often beneﬁcial to learn such a metric from the input training data, instead of using a default one such as the Euclidean distance. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed B OOST M ETRIC, for learning a quadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the metric remains positive semideﬁnite. Semideﬁnite programming is often used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and is not easy to implement. B OOST M ETRIC is instead based on the observation that any positive semideﬁnite matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. B OOST M ETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semideﬁnite matrices as weak learners within an efﬁcient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting methods are easy to implement, efﬁcient, and can accommodate various types of constraints. We extend traditional boosting algorithms in that its weak learner is a positive semideﬁnite matrix with trace and rank being one rather than a classiﬁer or regressor. Experiments on various data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms compare favorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and running time.

<p>Author: Blaine Nelson, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein, Ling Huang, Anthony D. Joseph, Steven J. Lee, Satish Rao, J. D. Tygar</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁers are often used to detect miscreant activities. We study how an adversary can systematically query a classiﬁer to elicit information that allows the attacker to evade detection while incurring a near-minimal cost of modifying their intended malfeasance. We generalize the theory of Lowd and Meek (2005) to the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers that partition their feature space into two sets, one of which is convex. We present query algorithms for this family that construct undetected instances of approximately minimal cost using only polynomially-many queries in the dimension of the space and in the level of approximation. Our results demonstrate that nearoptimal evasion can be accomplished for this family without reverse engineering the classiﬁer’s decision boundary. We also consider general ℓ p costs and show that near-optimal evasion on the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers is generally efﬁcient for both positive and negative convexity for all levels of approximation if p = 1.

<p>Author: Sivan Sabato, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: In the supervised learning setting termed Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL), the examples are bags of instances, and the bag label is a function of the labels of its instances. Typically, this function is the Boolean OR. The learner observes a sample of bags and the bag labels, but not the instance labels that determine the bag labels. The learner is then required to emit a classiﬁcation rule for bags based on the sample. MIL has numerous applications, and many heuristic algorithms have been used successfully on this problem, each adapted to speciﬁc settings or applications. In this work we provide a uniﬁed theoretical analysis for MIL, which holds for any underlying hypothesis class, regardless of a speciﬁc application or problem domain. We show that the sample complexity of MIL is only poly-logarithmically dependent on the size of the bag, for any underlying hypothesis class. In addition, we introduce a new PAC-learning algorithm for MIL, which uses a regular supervised learning algorithm as an oracle. We prove that efﬁcient PAC-learning for MIL can be generated from any efﬁcient non-MIL supervised learning algorithm that handles one-sided error. The computational complexity of the resulting algorithm is only polynomially dependent on the bag size.

<p>Author: Yiming Ying, Peng Li</p><p>Abstract: The main theme of this paper is to develop a novel eigenvalue optimization framework for learning a Mahalanobis metric. Within this context, we introduce a novel metric learning approach called DML-eig which is shown to be equivalent to a well-known eigenvalue optimization problem called minimizing the maximal eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix (Overton, 1988; Lewis and Overton, 1996). Moreover, we formulate LMNN (Weinberger et al., 2005), one of the state-of-the-art metric learning methods, as a similar eigenvalue optimization problem. This novel framework not only provides new insights into metric learning but also opens new avenues to the design of efﬁcient metric learning algorithms. Indeed, ﬁrst-order algorithms are developed for DML-eig and LMNN which only need the computation of the largest eigenvector of a matrix per iteration. Their convergence characteristics are rigorously established. Various experiments on benchmark data sets show the competitive performance of our new approaches. In addition, we report an encouraging result on a difﬁcult and challenging face veriﬁcation data set called Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW).

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is such an algorithm and it is an attractive choice for online Support Vector Machine (SVM) training due to its simplicity and effectiveness. When equipped with kernel functions, similarly to other SVM learning algorithms, SGD is susceptible to the curse of kernelization that causes unbounded linear growth in model size and update time with data size. This may render SGD inapplicable to large data sets. We address this issue by presenting a class of Budgeted SGD (BSGD) algorithms for large-scale kernel SVM training which have constant space and constant time complexity per update. Speciﬁcally, BSGD keeps the number of support vectors bounded during training through several budget maintenance strategies. We treat the budget maintenance as a source of the gradient error, and show that the gap between the BSGD and the optimal SVM solutions depends on the model degradation due to budget maintenance. To minimize the gap, we study greedy budget maintenance methods based on removal, projection, and merging of support vectors. We propose budgeted versions of several popular online SVM algorithms that belong to the SGD family. We further derive BSGD algorithms for multi-class SVM training. Comprehensive empirical results show that BSGD achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art budgeted online algorithms and comparable to non-budget algorithms, while achieving impressive computational efﬁciency both in time and space during training and prediction.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Claudio Gentile, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: We present a new online learning algorithm in the selective sampling framework, where labels must be actively queried before they are revealed. We prove bounds on the regret of our algorithm and on the number of labels it queries when faced with an adaptive adversarial strategy of generating the instances. Our bounds both generalize and strictly improve over previous bounds in similar settings. Additionally, our selective sampling algorithm can be converted into an efﬁcient statistical active learning algorithm. We extend our algorithm and analysis to the multiple-teacher setting, where the algorithm can choose which subset of teachers to query for each label. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques on a real-world Internet search problem.

<p>Author: Blaine Nelson, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein, Ling Huang, Anthony D. Joseph, Steven J. Lee, Satish Rao, J. D. Tygar</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁers are often used to detect miscreant activities. We study how an adversary can systematically query a classiﬁer to elicit information that allows the attacker to evade detection while incurring a near-minimal cost of modifying their intended malfeasance. We generalize the theory of Lowd and Meek (2005) to the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers that partition their feature space into two sets, one of which is convex. We present query algorithms for this family that construct undetected instances of approximately minimal cost using only polynomially-many queries in the dimension of the space and in the level of approximation. Our results demonstrate that nearoptimal evasion can be accomplished for this family without reverse engineering the classiﬁer’s decision boundary. We also consider general ℓ p costs and show that near-optimal evasion on the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers is generally efﬁcient for both positive and negative convexity for all levels of approximation if p = 1.

<p>Author: Sangkyun Lee, Stephen J. Wright</p><p>Abstract: Iterative methods that calculate their steps from approximate subgradient directions have proved to be useful for stochastic learning problems over large and streaming data sets. When the objective consists of a loss function plus a nonsmooth regularization term, the solution often lies on a lowdimensional manifold of parameter space along which the regularizer is smooth. (When an ℓ1 regularizer is used to induce sparsity in the solution, for example, this manifold is deﬁned by the set of nonzero components of the parameter vector.) This paper shows that a regularized dual averaging algorithm can identify this manifold, with high probability, before reaching the solution. This observation motivates an algorithmic strategy in which, once an iterate is suspected of lying on an optimal or near-optimal manifold, we switch to a “local phase” that searches in this manifold, thus converging rapidly to a near-optimal point. Computational results are presented to verify the identiﬁcation property and to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.

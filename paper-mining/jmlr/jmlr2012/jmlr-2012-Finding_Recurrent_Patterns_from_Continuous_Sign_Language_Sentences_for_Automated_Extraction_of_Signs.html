<p>Author: Helen Cooper, Eng-Jon Ong, Nicolas Pugeault, Richard Bowden</p><p>Abstract: This paper discusses sign language recognition using linguistic sub-units. It presents three types of sub-units for consideration; those learnt from appearance data as well as those inferred from both 2D or 3D tracking data. These sub-units are then combined using a sign level classiﬁer; here, two options are presented. The ﬁrst uses Markov Models to encode the temporal changes between sub-units. The second makes use of Sequential Pattern Boosting to apply discriminative feature selection at the same time as encoding temporal information. This approach is more robust to noise and performs well in signer independent tests, improving results from the 54% achieved by the Markov Chains to 76%.

<p>Author: David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: In machine translation, discriminative models have almost entirely supplanted the classical noisychannel model, but are standardly trained using a method that is reliable only in low-dimensional spaces. Two strands of research have tried to adapt more scalable discriminative training methods to machine translation: the ﬁrst uses log-linear probability models and either maximum likelihood or minimum risk, and the other uses linear models and large-margin methods. Here, we provide an overview of the latter. We compare several learning algorithms and describe in detail some novel extensions suited to properties of the translation task: no single correct output, a large space of structured outputs, and slow inference. We present experimental results on a large-scale ArabicEnglish translation task, demonstrating large gains in translation accuracy.

<p>Author: Yui Man Lui</p><p>Abstract: Action videos are multidimensional data and can be naturally represented as data tensors. While tensor computing is widely used in computer vision, the geometry of tensor space is often ignored. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the intrinsic geometry of tensor space which yields a very discriminating structure for action recognition. We characterize data tensors as points on a product manifold and model it statistically using least squares regression. To this aim, we factorize a data tensor relating to each order of the tensor using Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) and then impose each factorized element on a Grassmann manifold. Furthermore, we account for underlying geometry on manifolds and formulate least squares regression as a composite function. This gives a natural extension from Euclidean space to manifolds. Consequently, classiﬁcation is performed using geodesic distance on a product manifold where each factor manifold is Grassmannian. Our method exploits appearance and motion without explicitly modeling the shapes and dynamics. We assess the proposed method using three gesture databases, namely the Cambridge hand-gesture, the UMD Keck body-gesture, and the CHALEARN gesture challenge data sets. Experimental results reveal that not only does the proposed method perform well on the standard benchmark data sets, but also it generalizes well on the one-shot-learning gesture challenge. Furthermore, it is based on a simple statistical model and the intrinsic geometry of tensor space.

<p>Author: Sunita Nayak, Kester Duncan, Sudeep Sarkar, Barbara Loeding</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework to automatically learn models of recurring signs from multiple sign language video sequences containing the vocabulary of interest. We extract the parts of the signs that are present in most occurrences of the sign in context and are robust to the variations produced by adjacent signs. Each sentence video is ﬁrst transformed into a multidimensional time series representation, capturing the motion and shape aspects of the sign. Skin color blobs are extracted from frames of color video sequences, and a probabilistic relational distribution is formed for each frame using the contour and edge pixels from the skin blobs. Each sentence is represented as a trajectory in a low dimensional space called the space of relational distributions. Given these time series trajectories, we extract signemes from multiple sentences concurrently using iterated conditional modes (ICM). We show results by learning single signs from a collection of sentences with one common pervading sign, multiple signs from a collection of sentences with more than one common sign, and single signs from a mixed collection of sentences. The extracted signemes demonstrate that our approach is robust to some extent to the variations produced within a sign due to different contexts. We also show results whereby these learned sign models are used for spotting signs in test sequences.

<p>Author: JooSeuk Kim, Clayton D. Scott</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for nonparametric density estimation that exhibits robustness to contamination of the training sample. This method achieves robustness by combining a traditional kernel density estimator (KDE) with ideas from classical M-estimation. We interpret the KDE based on a positive semi-deﬁnite kernel as a sample mean in the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Since the sample mean is sensitive to outliers, we estimate it robustly via M-estimation, yielding a robust kernel density estimator (RKDE). An RKDE can be computed efﬁciently via a kernelized iteratively re-weighted least squares (IRWLS) algorithm. Necessary and sufﬁcient conditions are given for kernelized IRWLS to converge to the global minimizer of the M-estimator objective function. The robustness of the RKDE is demonstrated with a representer theorem, the inﬂuence function, and experimental results for density estimation and anomaly detection.

<p>Author: Helen Cooper, Eng-Jon Ong, Nicolas Pugeault, Richard Bowden</p><p>Abstract: This paper discusses sign language recognition using linguistic sub-units. It presents three types of sub-units for consideration; those learnt from appearance data as well as those inferred from both 2D or 3D tracking data. These sub-units are then combined using a sign level classiﬁer; here, two options are presented. The ﬁrst uses Markov Models to encode the temporal changes between sub-units. The second makes use of Sequential Pattern Boosting to apply discriminative feature selection at the same time as encoding temporal information. This approach is more robust to noise and performs well in signer independent tests, improving results from the 54% achieved by the Markov Chains to 76%.

<p>Author: Yui Man Lui</p><p>Abstract: Action videos are multidimensional data and can be naturally represented as data tensors. While tensor computing is widely used in computer vision, the geometry of tensor space is often ignored. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the intrinsic geometry of tensor space which yields a very discriminating structure for action recognition. We characterize data tensors as points on a product manifold and model it statistically using least squares regression. To this aim, we factorize a data tensor relating to each order of the tensor using Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) and then impose each factorized element on a Grassmann manifold. Furthermore, we account for underlying geometry on manifolds and formulate least squares regression as a composite function. This gives a natural extension from Euclidean space to manifolds. Consequently, classiﬁcation is performed using geodesic distance on a product manifold where each factor manifold is Grassmannian. Our method exploits appearance and motion without explicitly modeling the shapes and dynamics. We assess the proposed method using three gesture databases, namely the Cambridge hand-gesture, the UMD Keck body-gesture, and the CHALEARN gesture challenge data sets. Experimental results reveal that not only does the proposed method perform well on the standard benchmark data sets, but also it generalizes well on the one-shot-learning gesture challenge. Furthermore, it is based on a simple statistical model and the intrinsic geometry of tensor space.

<p>Author: George Konidaris, Ilya Scheidwasser, Andrew Barto</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for transfer in reinforcement learning based on the idea that related tasks share some common features, and that transfer can be achieved via those shared features. The framework attempts to capture the notion of tasks that are related but distinct, and provides some insight into when transfer can be usefully applied to a problem sequence and when it cannot. We apply the framework to the knowledge transfer problem, and show that an agent can learn a portable shaping function from experience in a sequence of tasks to signiﬁcantly improve performance in a later related task, even given a very brief training period. We also apply the framework to skill transfer, to show that agents can learn portable skills across a sequence of tasks that signiﬁcantly improve performance on later related tasks, approaching the performance of agents given perfectly learned problem-speciﬁc skills.

<p>Author: Aviv Tamar, Dotan Di Castro, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning an agent uses online feedback from the environment in order to adaptively select an effective policy. Model free approaches address this task by directly mapping environmental states to actions, while model based methods attempt to construct a model of the environment, followed by a selection of optimal actions based on that model. Given the complementary advantages of both approaches, we suggest a novel procedure which augments a model free algorithm with a partial model. The resulting hybrid algorithm switches between a model based and a model free mode, depending on the current state and the agent’s knowledge. Our method relies on a novel deﬁnition for a partially known model, and an estimator that incorporates such knowledge in order to reduce uncertainty in stochastic approximation iterations. We prove that such an approach leads to improved policy evaluation whenever environmental knowledge is available, without compromising performance when such knowledge is absent. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on policy gradient and Q-learning algorithms, and its usefulness in solving a call admission control problem.

<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Martin J. Wainwright, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Sparse additive models are families of d-variate functions with the additive decomposition f ∗ = ∑ j∈S f j∗ , where S is an unknown subset of cardinality s ≪ d. In this paper, we consider the case where each univariate component function f j∗ lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and analyze a method for estimating the unknown function f ∗ based on kernels combined with ℓ1 -type convex regularization. Working within a high-dimensional framework that allows both the dimension d and sparsity s to increase with n, we derive convergence rates in the L2 (P) and L2 (Pn ) norms over the class Fd,s,H of sparse additive models with each univariate function f j∗ in the unit ball of a univariate RKHS with bounded kernel function. We complement our upper bounds by deriving minimax lower bounds on the L2 (P) error, thereby showing the optimality of our method. Thus, we obtain optimal minimax rates for many interesting classes of sparse additive models, including polynomials, splines, and Sobolev classes. We also show that if, in contrast to our univariate conditions, the d-variate function class is assumed to be globally bounded, then much √ faster estimation rates are possible for any sparsity s = Ω( n), showing that global boundedness is a signiﬁcant restriction in the high-dimensional setting.

<p>Author: Karthik Mohan, Maryam Fazel</p><p>Abstract: The problem of minimizing the rank of a matrix subject to afﬁne constraints has applications in several areas including machine learning, and is known to be NP-hard. A tractable relaxation for this problem is nuclear norm (or trace norm) minimization, which is guaranteed to ﬁnd the minimum rank matrix under suitable assumptions. In this paper, we propose a family of Iterative Reweighted Least Squares algorithms IRLS-p (with 0 ≤ p ≤ 1), as a computationally efﬁcient way to improve over the performance of nuclear norm minimization. The algorithms can be viewed as (locally) minimizing certain smooth approximations to the rank function. When p = 1, we give theoretical guarantees similar to those for nuclear norm minimization, that is, recovery of low-rank matrices under certain assumptions on the operator deﬁning the constraints. For p < 1, IRLSp shows better empirical performance in terms of recovering low-rank matrices than nuclear norm minimization. We provide an efﬁcient implementation for IRLS-p, and also present a related family of algorithms, sIRLS-p. These algorithms exhibit competitive run times and improved recovery when compared to existing algorithms for random instances of the matrix completion problem, as well as on the MovieLens movie recommendation data set.

<p>Author: Sivan Sabato, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: In the supervised learning setting termed Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL), the examples are bags of instances, and the bag label is a function of the labels of its instances. Typically, this function is the Boolean OR. The learner observes a sample of bags and the bag labels, but not the instance labels that determine the bag labels. The learner is then required to emit a classiﬁcation rule for bags based on the sample. MIL has numerous applications, and many heuristic algorithms have been used successfully on this problem, each adapted to speciﬁc settings or applications. In this work we provide a uniﬁed theoretical analysis for MIL, which holds for any underlying hypothesis class, regardless of a speciﬁc application or problem domain. We show that the sample complexity of MIL is only poly-logarithmically dependent on the size of the bag, for any underlying hypothesis class. In addition, we introduce a new PAC-learning algorithm for MIL, which uses a regular supervised learning algorithm as an oracle. We prove that efﬁcient PAC-learning for MIL can be generated from any efﬁcient non-MIL supervised learning algorithm that handles one-sided error. The computational complexity of the resulting algorithm is only polynomially dependent on the bag size.

<p>Author: Petros Drineas, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Michael W. Mahoney, David P. Woodruff</p><p>Abstract: The statistical leverage scores of a matrix A are the squared row-norms of the matrix containing its (top) left singular vectors and the coherence is the largest leverage score. These quantities are of interest in recently-popular problems such as matrix completion and Nystr¨ m-based low-rank o matrix approximation as well as in large-scale statistical data analysis applications more generally; moreover, they are of interest since they deﬁne the key structural nonuniformity that must be dealt with in developing fast randomized matrix algorithms. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that takes as input an arbitrary n × d matrix A, with n ≫ d, and that returns as output relative-error approximations to all n of the statistical leverage scores. The proposed algorithm runs (under assumptions on the precise values of n and d) in O(nd log n) time, as opposed to the O(nd 2 ) time required by the na¨ve algorithm that involves computing an orthogonal basis for the ı range of A. Our analysis may be viewed in terms of computing a relative-error approximation to an underconstrained least-squares approximation problem, or, relatedly, it may be viewed as an application of Johnson-Lindenstrauss type ideas. Several practically-important extensions of our basic result are also described, including the approximation of so-called cross-leverage scores, the extension of these ideas to matrices with n ≈ d, and the extension to streaming environments.

<p>Author: Christopher R. Genovese, Jiashun Jin, Larry Wasserman, Zhigang Yao</p><p>Abstract: The lasso is an important method for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems, with efﬁcient algorithms available, a long history of practical success, and a large body of theoretical results supporting and explaining its performance. But even with the best available algorithms, ﬁnding the lasso solutions remains a computationally challenging task in cases where the number of covariates vastly exceeds the number of data points. Marginal regression, where each dependent variable is regressed separately on each covariate, offers a promising alternative in this case because the estimates can be computed roughly two orders faster than the lasso solutions. The question that remains is how the statistical performance of the method compares to that of the lasso in these cases. In this paper, we study the relative statistical performance of the lasso and marginal regression for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems. We consider the problem of learning which coefﬁcients are non-zero. Our main results are as follows: (i) we compare the conditions under which the lasso and marginal regression guarantee exact recovery in the ﬁxed design, noise free case; (ii) we establish conditions under which marginal regression provides exact recovery with high probability in the ﬁxed design, noise free, random coefﬁcients case; and (iii) we derive rates of convergence for both procedures, where performance is measured by the number of coefﬁcients with incorrect sign, and characterize the regions in the parameter space recovery is and is not possible under this metric. In light of the computational advantages of marginal regression in very high dimensional problems, our theoretical and simulations results suggest that the procedure merits further study.

<p>Author: Sahand Negahban, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the matrix completion problem under a form of row/column weighted entrywise sampling, including the case of uniform entrywise sampling as a special case. We analyze the associated random observation operator, and prove that with high probability, it satisﬁes a form of restricted strong convexity with respect to weighted Frobenius norm. Using this property, we obtain as corollaries a number of error bounds on matrix completion in the weighted Frobenius norm under noisy sampling and for both exact and near low-rank matrices. Our results are based on measures of the “spikiness” and “low-rankness” of matrices that are less restrictive than the incoherence conditions imposed in previous work. Our technique involves an M-estimator that includes controls on both the rank and spikiness of the solution, and we establish non-asymptotic error bounds in weighted Frobenius norm for recovering matrices lying with ℓq -“balls” of bounded spikiness. Using information-theoretic methods, we show that no algorithm can achieve better estimates (up to a logarithmic factor) over these same sets, showing that our conditions on matrices and associated rates are essentially optimal.

<p>Author: Yongdai Kim, Sunghoon Kwon, Hosik Choi</p><p>Abstract: Asymptotic properties of model selection criteria for high-dimensional regression models are studied where the dimension of covariates is much larger than the sample size. Several sufﬁcient conditions for model selection consistency are provided. Non-Gaussian error distributions are considered and it is shown that the maximal number of covariates for model selection consistency depends on the tail behavior of the error distribution. Also, sufﬁcient conditions for model selection consistency are given when the variance of the noise is neither known nor estimated consistently. Results of simulation studies as well as real data analysis are given to illustrate that ﬁnite sample performances of consistent model selection criteria can be quite different.

<p>Author: Ji Liu, Peter Wonka, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the following sparse signal recovery (or feature selection) problem: given a design matrix X ∈ Rn×m (m ≫ n) and a noisy observation vector y ∈ Rn satisfying y = Xβ∗ + ε where ε is the noise vector following a Gaussian distribution N(0, σ2 I), how to recover the signal (or parameter vector) β∗ when the signal is sparse? The Dantzig selector has been proposed for sparse signal recovery with strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage Dantzig selector method, which iteratively reﬁnes the target signal β∗ . We show that if X obeys a certain condition, then with a large probability ˆ the difference between the solution β estimated by the proposed method and the true solution β∗ measured in terms of the ℓ p norm (p ≥ 1) is bounded as ˆ β − β∗ p ≤ C(s − N)1/p log m + ∆ σ, where C is a constant, s is the number of nonzero entries in β∗ , the risk of the oracle estimator ∆ is independent of m and is much smaller than the ﬁrst term, and N is the number of entries of β∗ larger √ than a certain value in the order of O (σ log m). The proposed √ method improves the estimation √ bound of the standard Dantzig selector approximately from Cs1/p log mσ to C(s − N)1/p log mσ where the value N depends on the number of large entries in β∗ . When N = s, the proposed algorithm achieves the oracle solution with a high probability, where the oracle solution is the projection of the observation vector y onto true features. In addition, with a large probability, the proposed method can select the same number of correct features under a milder condition than the Dantzig selector. Finally, we extend this multi-stage procedure to the LASSO case.

<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Martin J. Wainwright, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Sparse additive models are families of d-variate functions with the additive decomposition f ∗ = ∑ j∈S f j∗ , where S is an unknown subset of cardinality s ≪ d. In this paper, we consider the case where each univariate component function f j∗ lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and analyze a method for estimating the unknown function f ∗ based on kernels combined with ℓ1 -type convex regularization. Working within a high-dimensional framework that allows both the dimension d and sparsity s to increase with n, we derive convergence rates in the L2 (P) and L2 (Pn ) norms over the class Fd,s,H of sparse additive models with each univariate function f j∗ in the unit ball of a univariate RKHS with bounded kernel function. We complement our upper bounds by deriving minimax lower bounds on the L2 (P) error, thereby showing the optimality of our method. Thus, we obtain optimal minimax rates for many interesting classes of sparse additive models, including polynomials, splines, and Sobolev classes. We also show that if, in contrast to our univariate conditions, the d-variate function class is assumed to be globally bounded, then much √ faster estimation rates are possible for any sparsity s = Ω( n), showing that global boundedness is a signiﬁcant restriction in the high-dimensional setting.

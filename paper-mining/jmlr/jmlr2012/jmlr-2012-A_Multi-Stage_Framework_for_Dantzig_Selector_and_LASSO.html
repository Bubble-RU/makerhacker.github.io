<p>Author: Blaine Nelson, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein, Ling Huang, Anthony D. Joseph, Steven J. Lee, Satish Rao, J. D. Tygar</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁers are often used to detect miscreant activities. We study how an adversary can systematically query a classiﬁer to elicit information that allows the attacker to evade detection while incurring a near-minimal cost of modifying their intended malfeasance. We generalize the theory of Lowd and Meek (2005) to the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers that partition their feature space into two sets, one of which is convex. We present query algorithms for this family that construct undetected instances of approximately minimal cost using only polynomially-many queries in the dimension of the space and in the level of approximation. Our results demonstrate that nearoptimal evasion can be accomplished for this family without reverse engineering the classiﬁer’s decision boundary. We also consider general ℓ p costs and show that near-optimal evasion on the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers is generally efﬁcient for both positive and negative convexity for all levels of approximation if p = 1.

<p>Author: Jian Huang, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The ℓ1 -penalized method, or the Lasso, has emerged as an important tool for the analysis of large data sets. Many important results have been obtained for the Lasso in linear regression which have led to a deeper understanding of high-dimensional statistical problems. In this article, we consider a class of weighted ℓ1 -penalized estimators for convex loss functions of a general form, including the generalized linear models. We study the estimation, prediction, selection and sparsity properties of the weighted ℓ1 -penalized estimator in sparse, high-dimensional settings where the number of predictors p can be much larger than the sample size n. Adaptive Lasso is considered as a special case. A multistage method is developed to approximate concave regularized estimation by applying an adaptive Lasso recursively. We provide prediction and estimation oracle inequalities for single- and multi-stage estimators, a general selection consistency theorem, and an upper bound for the dimension of the Lasso estimator. Important models including the linear regression, logistic regression and log-linear models are used throughout to illustrate the applications of the general results.

<p>Author: Christopher R. Genovese, Jiashun Jin, Larry Wasserman, Zhigang Yao</p><p>Abstract: The lasso is an important method for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems, with efﬁcient algorithms available, a long history of practical success, and a large body of theoretical results supporting and explaining its performance. But even with the best available algorithms, ﬁnding the lasso solutions remains a computationally challenging task in cases where the number of covariates vastly exceeds the number of data points. Marginal regression, where each dependent variable is regressed separately on each covariate, offers a promising alternative in this case because the estimates can be computed roughly two orders faster than the lasso solutions. The question that remains is how the statistical performance of the method compares to that of the lasso in these cases. In this paper, we study the relative statistical performance of the lasso and marginal regression for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems. We consider the problem of learning which coefﬁcients are non-zero. Our main results are as follows: (i) we compare the conditions under which the lasso and marginal regression guarantee exact recovery in the ﬁxed design, noise free case; (ii) we establish conditions under which marginal regression provides exact recovery with high probability in the ﬁxed design, noise free, random coefﬁcients case; and (iii) we derive rates of convergence for both procedures, where performance is measured by the number of coefﬁcients with incorrect sign, and characterize the regions in the parameter space recovery is and is not possible under this metric. In light of the computational advantages of marginal regression in very high dimensional problems, our theoretical and simulations results suggest that the procedure merits further study.

We show that if X obeys a certain condition, then with a large probability ˆ the difference between the solution β estimated by the proposed method and the true solution β∗ measured in terms of the ℓ p norm (p ≥ 1) is bounded as ˆ β − β∗ p ≤ C(s − N)1/p log m + ∆ σ, where C is a constant, s is the number of nonzero entries in β∗ , the risk of the oracle estimator ∆ is independent of m and is much smaller than the ﬁrst term, and N is the number of entries of β∗ larger √ than a certain value in the order of O (σ log m). The proposed √ method improves the estimation √ bound of the standard Dantzig selector approximately from Cs1/p log mσ to C(s − N)1/p log mσ where the value N depends on the number of large entries in β∗ .

<p>Author: Mario Frank, Andreas P. Streich, David Basin, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic model for clustering Boolean data where an object can be simultaneously assigned to multiple clusters. By explicitly modeling the underlying generative process that combines the individual source emissions, highly structured data are expressed with substantially fewer clusters compared to single-assignment clustering. As a consequence, such a model provides robust parameter estimators even when the number of samples is low. We extend the model with different noise processes and demonstrate that maximum-likelihood estimation with multiple assignments consistently infers source parameters more accurately than single-assignment clustering. Our model is primarily motivated by the task of role mining for role-based access control, where users of a system are assigned one or more roles. In experiments with real-world access-control data, our model exhibits better generalization performance than state-of-the-art approaches.

<p>Author: Ji Liu, Peter Wonka, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the following sparse signal recovery (or feature selection) problem: given a design matrix X ∈ Rn×m (m ≫ n) and a noisy observation vector y ∈ Rn satisfying y = Xβ∗ + ε where ε is the noise vector following a Gaussian distribution N(0, σ2 I), how to recover the signal (or parameter vector) β∗ when the signal is sparse? The Dantzig selector has been proposed for sparse signal recovery with strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage Dantzig selector method, which iteratively reﬁnes the target signal β∗ . We show that if X obeys a certain condition, then with a large probability ˆ the difference between the solution β estimated by the proposed method and the true solution β∗ measured in terms of the ℓ p norm (p ≥ 1) is bounded as ˆ β − β∗ p ≤ C(s − N)1/p log m + ∆ σ, where C is a constant, s is the number of nonzero entries in β∗ , the risk of the oracle estimator ∆ is independent of m and is much smaller than the ﬁrst term, and N is the number of entries of β∗ larger √ than a certain value in the order of O (σ log m). The proposed √ method improves the estimation √ bound of the standard Dantzig selector approximately from Cs1/p log mσ to C(s − N)1/p log mσ where the value N depends on the number of large entries in β∗ . When N = s, the proposed algorithm achieves the oracle solution with a high probability, where the oracle solution is the projection of the observation vector y onto true features. In addition, with a large probability, the proposed method can select the same number of correct features under a milder condition than the Dantzig selector. Finally, we extend this multi-stage procedure to the LASSO case.

<p>Author: Christopher R. Genovese, Jiashun Jin, Larry Wasserman, Zhigang Yao</p><p>Abstract: The lasso is an important method for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems, with efﬁcient algorithms available, a long history of practical success, and a large body of theoretical results supporting and explaining its performance. But even with the best available algorithms, ﬁnding the lasso solutions remains a computationally challenging task in cases where the number of covariates vastly exceeds the number of data points. Marginal regression, where each dependent variable is regressed separately on each covariate, offers a promising alternative in this case because the estimates can be computed roughly two orders faster than the lasso solutions. The question that remains is how the statistical performance of the method compares to that of the lasso in these cases. In this paper, we study the relative statistical performance of the lasso and marginal regression for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems. We consider the problem of learning which coefﬁcients are non-zero. Our main results are as follows: (i) we compare the conditions under which the lasso and marginal regression guarantee exact recovery in the ﬁxed design, noise free case; (ii) we establish conditions under which marginal regression provides exact recovery with high probability in the ﬁxed design, noise free, random coefﬁcients case; and (iii) we derive rates of convergence for both procedures, where performance is measured by the number of coefﬁcients with incorrect sign, and characterize the regions in the parameter space recovery is and is not possible under this metric. In light of the computational advantages of marginal regression in very high dimensional problems, our theoretical and simulations results suggest that the procedure merits further study.

<p>Author: Sahand Negahban, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the matrix completion problem under a form of row/column weighted entrywise sampling, including the case of uniform entrywise sampling as a special case. We analyze the associated random observation operator, and prove that with high probability, it satisﬁes a form of restricted strong convexity with respect to weighted Frobenius norm. Using this property, we obtain as corollaries a number of error bounds on matrix completion in the weighted Frobenius norm under noisy sampling and for both exact and near low-rank matrices. Our results are based on measures of the “spikiness” and “low-rankness” of matrices that are less restrictive than the incoherence conditions imposed in previous work. Our technique involves an M-estimator that includes controls on both the rank and spikiness of the solution, and we establish non-asymptotic error bounds in weighted Frobenius norm for recovering matrices lying with ℓq -“balls” of bounded spikiness. Using information-theoretic methods, we show that no algorithm can achieve better estimates (up to a logarithmic factor) over these same sets, showing that our conditions on matrices and associated rates are essentially optimal.

<p>Author: Jian Huang, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The ℓ1 -penalized method, or the Lasso, has emerged as an important tool for the analysis of large data sets. Many important results have been obtained for the Lasso in linear regression which have led to a deeper understanding of high-dimensional statistical problems. In this article, we consider a class of weighted ℓ1 -penalized estimators for convex loss functions of a general form, including the generalized linear models. We study the estimation, prediction, selection and sparsity properties of the weighted ℓ1 -penalized estimator in sparse, high-dimensional settings where the number of predictors p can be much larger than the sample size n. Adaptive Lasso is considered as a special case. A multistage method is developed to approximate concave regularized estimation by applying an adaptive Lasso recursively. We provide prediction and estimation oracle inequalities for single- and multi-stage estimators, a general selection consistency theorem, and an upper bound for the dimension of the Lasso estimator. Important models including the linear regression, logistic regression and log-linear models are used throughout to illustrate the applications of the general results.

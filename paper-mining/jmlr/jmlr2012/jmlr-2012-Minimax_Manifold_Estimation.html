<p>Author: Yui Man Lui</p><p>Abstract: Action videos are multidimensional data and can be naturally represented as data tensors. While tensor computing is widely used in computer vision, the geometry of tensor space is often ignored. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the intrinsic geometry of tensor space which yields a very discriminating structure for action recognition. We characterize data tensors as points on a product manifold and model it statistically using least squares regression. To this aim, we factorize a data tensor relating to each order of the tensor using Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) and then impose each factorized element on a Grassmann manifold. Furthermore, we account for underlying geometry on manifolds and formulate least squares regression as a composite function. This gives a natural extension from Euclidean space to manifolds. Consequently, classiﬁcation is performed using geodesic distance on a product manifold where each factor manifold is Grassmannian. Our method exploits appearance and motion without explicitly modeling the shapes and dynamics. We assess the proposed method using three gesture databases, namely the Cambridge hand-gesture, the UMD Keck body-gesture, and the CHALEARN gesture challenge data sets. Experimental results reveal that not only does the proposed method perform well on the standard benchmark data sets, but also it generalizes well on the one-shot-learning gesture challenge. Furthermore, it is based on a simple statistical model and the intrinsic geometry of tensor space.

<p>Author: Uri Shalit, Daphna Weinshall, Gal Chechik</p><p>Abstract: When learning models that are represented in matrix forms, enforcing a low-rank constraint can dramatically improve the memory and run time complexity, while providing a natural regularization of the model. However, naive approaches to minimizing functions over the set of low-rank matrices are either prohibitively time consuming (repeated singular value decomposition of the matrix) or numerically unstable (optimizing a factored representation of the low-rank matrix). We build on recent advances in optimization over manifolds, and describe an iterative online learning procedure, consisting of a gradient step, followed by a second-order retraction back to the manifold. While the ideal retraction is costly to compute, and so is the projection operator that approximates it, we describe another retraction that can be computed efﬁciently. It has run time and memory complexity of O ((n + m)k) for a rank-k matrix of dimension m × n, when using an online procedure with rank-one gradients. We use this algorithm, L ORETA, to learn a matrix-form similarity measure over pairs of documents represented as high dimensional vectors. L ORETA improves the mean average precision over a passive-aggressive approach in a factorized model, and also improves over a full model trained on pre-selected features using the same memory requirements. We further adapt L ORETA to learn positive semi-deﬁnite low-rank matrices, providing an online algorithm for low-rank metric learning. L ORETA also shows consistent improvement over standard weakly supervised methods in a large (1600 classes and 1 million images, using ImageNet) multi-label image classiﬁcation task.

<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Martin J. Wainwright, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Sparse additive models are families of d-variate functions with the additive decomposition f ∗ = ∑ j∈S f j∗ , where S is an unknown subset of cardinality s ≪ d. In this paper, we consider the case where each univariate component function f j∗ lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and analyze a method for estimating the unknown function f ∗ based on kernels combined with ℓ1 -type convex regularization. Working within a high-dimensional framework that allows both the dimension d and sparsity s to increase with n, we derive convergence rates in the L2 (P) and L2 (Pn ) norms over the class Fd,s,H of sparse additive models with each univariate function f j∗ in the unit ball of a univariate RKHS with bounded kernel function. We complement our upper bounds by deriving minimax lower bounds on the L2 (P) error, thereby showing the optimality of our method. Thus, we obtain optimal minimax rates for many interesting classes of sparse additive models, including polynomials, splines, and Sobolev classes. We also show that if, in contrast to our univariate conditions, the d-variate function class is assumed to be globally bounded, then much √ faster estimation rates are possible for any sparsity s = Ω( n), showing that global boundedness is a signiﬁcant restriction in the high-dimensional setting.

<p>Author: Sangkyun Lee, Stephen J. Wright</p><p>Abstract: Iterative methods that calculate their steps from approximate subgradient directions have proved to be useful for stochastic learning problems over large and streaming data sets. When the objective consists of a loss function plus a nonsmooth regularization term, the solution often lies on a lowdimensional manifold of parameter space along which the regularizer is smooth. (When an ℓ1 regularizer is used to induce sparsity in the solution, for example, this manifold is deﬁned by the set of nonzero components of the parameter vector.) This paper shows that a regularized dual averaging algorithm can identify this manifold, with high probability, before reaching the solution. This observation motivates an algorithmic strategy in which, once an iterate is suspected of lying on an optimal or near-optimal manifold, we switch to a “local phase” that searches in this manifold, thus converging rapidly to a near-optimal point. Computational results are presented to verify the identiﬁcation property and to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.

<p>Author: Antti Hyttinen, Frederick Eberhardt, Patrik O. Hoyer</p><p>Abstract: Identifying cause-effect relationships between variables of interest is a central problem in science. Given a set of experiments we describe a procedure that identiﬁes linear models that may contain cycles and latent variables. We provide a detailed description of the model family, full proofs of the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for identiﬁability, a search algorithm that is complete, and a discussion of what can be done when the identiﬁability conditions are not satisﬁed. The algorithm is comprehensively tested in simulations, comparing it to competing algorithms in the literature. Furthermore, we adapt the procedure to the problem of cellular network inference, applying it to the biologically realistic data of the DREAM challenges. The paper provides a full theoretical foundation for the causal discovery procedure ﬁrst presented by Eberhardt et al. (2010) and Hyttinen et al. (2010).

This manuscript studies this primal-dual relationship under a broad family of losses, including the exponential loss of AdaBoost and the logistic loss, revealing: • Weak learnability aids the whole loss family: for any ε > 0, O (ln(1/ε)) iterations sufﬁce to produce a predictor with empirical risk ε-close to the inﬁmum; • The circumstances granting the existence of an empirical risk minimizer may be characterized in terms of the primal and dual problems, yielding a new proof of the known rate O (ln(1/ε)); • Arbitrary instances may be decomposed into the above two, granting rate O (1/ε), with a matching lower bound provided for the logistic loss.

<p>Author: Yiming Ying, Peng Li</p><p>Abstract: The main theme of this paper is to develop a novel eigenvalue optimization framework for learning a Mahalanobis metric. Within this context, we introduce a novel metric learning approach called DML-eig which is shown to be equivalent to a well-known eigenvalue optimization problem called minimizing the maximal eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix (Overton, 1988; Lewis and Overton, 1996). Moreover, we formulate LMNN (Weinberger et al., 2005), one of the state-of-the-art metric learning methods, as a similar eigenvalue optimization problem. This novel framework not only provides new insights into metric learning but also opens new avenues to the design of efﬁcient metric learning algorithms. Indeed, ﬁrst-order algorithms are developed for DML-eig and LMNN which only need the computation of the largest eigenvector of a matrix per iteration. Their convergence characteristics are rigorously established. Various experiments on benchmark data sets show the competitive performance of our new approaches. In addition, we report an encouraging result on a difﬁcult and challenging face veriﬁcation data set called Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW).

<p>Author: Jia Zeng</p><p>Abstract: Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is an important hierarchical Bayesian model for probabilistic topic modeling, which attracts worldwide interests and touches on many important applications in text mining, computer vision and computational biology. This paper introduces a topic modeling toolbox (TMBP) based on the belief propagation (BP) algorithms. TMBP toolbox is implemented by MEX C++/Matlab/Octave for either Windows 7 or Linux. Compared with existing topic modeling packages, the novelty of this toolbox lies in the BP algorithms for learning LDA-based topic models. The current version includes BP algorithms for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), authortopic models (ATM), relational topic models (RTM), and labeled LDA (LaLDA). This toolbox is an ongoing project and more BP-based algorithms for various topic models will be added in the near future. Interested users may also extend BP algorithms for learning more complicated topic models.

We also prove minimax lower bounds which show that the obtained rates are almost tight.

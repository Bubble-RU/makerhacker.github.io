<p>Author: David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: In machine translation, discriminative models have almost entirely supplanted the classical noisychannel model, but are standardly trained using a method that is reliable only in low-dimensional spaces. Two strands of research have tried to adapt more scalable discriminative training methods to machine translation: the ﬁrst uses log-linear probability models and either maximum likelihood or minimum risk, and the other uses linear models and large-margin methods. Here, we provide an overview of the latter. We compare several learning algorithms and describe in detail some novel extensions suited to properties of the translation task: no single correct output, a large space of structured outputs, and slow inference. We present experimental results on a large-scale ArabicEnglish translation task, demonstrating large gains in translation accuracy.

<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: There is growing body of learning problems for which it is natural to organize the parameters into a matrix. As a result, it becomes easy to impose sophisticated prior knowledge by appropriately regularizing the parameters under some matrix norm. This work describes and analyzes a systematic method for constructing such matrix-based regularization techniques. In particular, we focus on how the underlying statistical properties of a given problem can help us decide which regularization function is appropriate. Our methodology is based on a known duality phenomenon: a function is strongly convex with respect to some norm if and only if its conjugate function is strongly smooth with respect to the dual norm. This result has already been found to be a key component in deriving and analyzing several learning algorithms. We demonstrate the potential of this framework by deriving novel generalization and regret bounds for multi-task learning, multi-class learning, and multiple kernel learning.

<p>Author: Vikas C. Raykar, Shipeng Yu</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of crowdsourcing services it has become quite cheap and reasonably effective to get a data set labeled by multiple annotators in a short amount of time. Various methods have been proposed to estimate the consensus labels by correcting for the bias of annotators with different kinds of expertise. Since we do not have control over the quality of the annotators, very often the annotations can be dominated by spammers, deﬁned as annotators who assign labels randomly without actually looking at the instance. Spammers can make the cost of acquiring labels very expensive and can potentially degrade the quality of the ﬁnal consensus labels. In this paper we propose an empirical Bayesian algorithm called SpEM that iteratively eliminates the spammers and estimates the consensus labels based only on the good annotators. The algorithm is motivated by deﬁning a spammer score that can be used to rank the annotators. Experiments on simulated and real data show that the proposed approach is better than (or as good as) the earlier approaches in terms of the accuracy and uses a signiﬁcantly smaller number of annotators.

<p>Author: Nir Ailon</p><p>Abstract: Given a set V of n elements we wish to linearly order them given pairwise preference labels which may be non-transitive (due to irrationality or arbitrary noise). The goal is to linearly order the elements while disagreeing with as few pairwise preference labels as possible. Our performance is measured by two parameters: The number of disagreements (loss) and the query complexity (number of pairwise preference labels). Our algorithm adaptively queries at most O(ε−6 n log5 n) preference labels for a regret of ε times the optimal loss. As a function of n, this is asymptotically better than standard (non-adaptive) learning bounds achievable for the same problem. Our main result takes us a step closer toward settling an open problem posed by learning-torank (from pairwise information) theoreticians and practitioners: What is a provably correct way to sample preference labels? To further show the power and practicality of our solution, we analyze a typical test case in which a large margin linear relaxation is used for efﬁciently solving the simpler learning problems in our decomposition.

<p>Author: Michael Brückner, Christian Kanzow, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: The standard assumption of identically distributed training and test data is violated when the test data are generated in response to the presence of a predictive model. This becomes apparent, for example, in the context of email spam ﬁltering. Here, email service providers employ spam ﬁlters, and spam senders engineer campaign templates to achieve a high rate of successful deliveries despite the ﬁlters. We model the interaction between the learner and the data generator as a static game in which the cost functions of the learner and the data generator are not necessarily antagonistic. We identify conditions under which this prediction game has a unique Nash equilibrium and derive algorithms that ﬁnd the equilibrial prediction model. We derive two instances, the Nash logistic regression and the Nash support vector machine, and empirically explore their properties in a case study on email spam ﬁltering.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Ran Gilad-Bachrach, Ohad Shamir, Lin Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Online prediction methods are typically presented as serial algorithms running on a single processor. However, in the age of web-scale prediction problems, it is increasingly common to encounter situations where a single processor cannot keep up with the high rate at which inputs arrive. In this work, we present the distributed mini-batch algorithm, a method of converting many serial gradient-based online prediction algorithms into distributed algorithms. We prove a regret bound for this method that is asymptotically optimal for smooth convex loss functions and stochastic inputs. Moreover, our analysis explicitly takes into account communication latencies between nodes in the distributed environment. We show how our method can be used to solve the closely-related distributed stochastic optimization problem, achieving an asymptotically linear speed-up over multiple processors. Finally, we demonstrate the merits of our approach on a web-scale online prediction problem.

<p>Author: Gavin Brown, Adam Pocock, Ming-Jie Zhao, Mikel Luján</p><p>Abstract: We present a unifying framework for information theoretic feature selection, bringing almost two decades of research on heuristic ﬁlter criteria under a single theoretical interpretation. This is in response to the question: “what are the implicit statistical assumptions of feature selection criteria based on mutual information?”. To answer this, we adopt a different strategy than is usual in the feature selection literature—instead of trying to deﬁne a criterion, we derive one, directly from a clearly speciﬁed objective function: the conditional likelihood of the training labels. While many hand-designed heuristic criteria try to optimize a deﬁnition of feature ‘relevancy’ and ‘redundancy’, our approach leads to a probabilistic framework which naturally incorporates these concepts. As a result we can unify the numerous criteria published over the last two decades, and show them to be low-order approximations to the exact (but intractable) optimisation problem. The primary contribution is to show that common heuristics for information based feature selection (including Markov Blanket algorithms as a special case) are approximate iterative maximisers of the conditional likelihood. A large empirical study provides strong evidence to favour certain classes of criteria, in particular those that balance the relative size of the relevancy/redundancy terms. Overall we conclude that the JMI criterion (Yang and Moody, 1999; Meyer et al., 2008) provides the best tradeoff in terms of accuracy, stability, and ﬂexibility with small data samples.

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Mark Dredze, Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Conﬁdence-weighted online learning is a generalization of margin-based learning of linear classiﬁers in which the margin constraint is replaced by a probabilistic constraint based on a distribution over classiﬁer weights that is updated online as examples are observed. The distribution captures a notion of conﬁdence on classiﬁer weights, and in some cases it can also be interpreted as replacing a single learning rate by adaptive per-weight rates. Conﬁdence-weighted learning was motivated by the statistical properties of natural-language classiﬁcation tasks, where most of the informative features are relatively rare. We investigate several versions of conﬁdence-weighted learning that use a Gaussian distribution over weight vectors, updated at each observed example to achieve high probability of correct classiﬁcation for the example. Empirical evaluation on a range of textcategorization tasks show that our algorithms improve over other state-of-the-art online and batch methods, learn faster in the online setting, and lead to better classiﬁer combination for a type of distributed training commonly used in cloud computing.

<p>Author: Trinh Minh Tri Do, Thierry Artières</p><p>Abstract: Machine learning is most often cast as an optimization problem. Ideally, one expects a convex objective function to rely on efﬁcient convex optimizers with nice guarantees such as no local optima. Yet, non-convexity is very frequent in practice and it may sometimes be inappropriate to look for convexity at any price. Alternatively one can decide not to limit a priori the modeling expressivity to models whose learning may be solved by convex optimization and rely on non-convex optimization algorithms. The main motivation of this work is to provide efﬁcient and scalable algorithms for non-convex optimization. We focus on regularized unconstrained optimization problems which cover a large number of modern machine learning problems such as logistic regression, conditional random ﬁelds, large margin estimation, etc. We propose a novel algorithm for minimizing a regularized objective that is able to handle convex and non-convex, smooth and non-smooth risks. The algorithm is based on the cutting plane technique and on the idea of exploiting the regularization term in the objective function. It may be thought as a limited memory extension of convex regularized bundle methods for dealing with convex and non convex risks. In case the risk is convex the algorithm is proved to converge to a stationary solution with accuracy ε with a rate O(1/λε) where λ is the regularization parameter of the objective function under the assumption of a Lipschitz empirical risk. In case the risk is not convex getting such a proof is more difﬁcult and requires a stronger and more disputable assumption. Yet we provide experimental results on artiﬁcial test problems, and on ﬁve standard and difﬁcult machine learning problems that are cast as convex and non-convex optimization problems that show how our algorithm compares well in practice with state of the art optimization algorithms.

<p>Author: Chunhua Shen, Junae Kim, Lei Wang, Anton van den Hengel</p><p>Abstract: The success of many machine learning and pattern recognition methods relies heavily upon the identiﬁcation of an appropriate distance metric on the input data. It is often beneﬁcial to learn such a metric from the input training data, instead of using a default one such as the Euclidean distance. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed B OOST M ETRIC, for learning a quadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the metric remains positive semideﬁnite. Semideﬁnite programming is often used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and is not easy to implement. B OOST M ETRIC is instead based on the observation that any positive semideﬁnite matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. B OOST M ETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semideﬁnite matrices as weak learners within an efﬁcient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting methods are easy to implement, efﬁcient, and can accommodate various types of constraints. We extend traditional boosting algorithms in that its weak learner is a positive semideﬁnite matrix with trace and rank being one rather than a classiﬁer or regressor. Experiments on various data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms compare favorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and running time.

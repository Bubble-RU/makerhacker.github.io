<p>Author: Chia-Hua Ho, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Support vector regression (SVR) and support vector classiﬁcation (SVC) are popular learning techniques, but their use with kernels is often time consuming. Recently, linear SVC without kernels has been shown to give competitive accuracy for some applications, but enjoys much faster training/testing. However, few studies have focused on linear SVR. In this paper, we extend state-of-theart training methods for linear SVC to linear SVR. We show that the extension is straightforward for some methods, but is not trivial for some others. Our experiments demonstrate that for some problems, the proposed linear-SVR training methods can very efﬁciently produce models that are as good as kernel SVR.

<p>Author: Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar, Vicenç Gómez, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel policy iteration method, called dynamic policy programming (DPP), to estimate the optimal policy in the inﬁnite-horizon Markov decision processes. DPP is an incremental algorithm that forces a gradual change in policy update. This allows us to prove ﬁnite-iteration and asymptotic ℓ∞ -norm performance-loss bounds in the presence of approximation/estimation error which depend on the average accumulated error as opposed to the standard bounds which are expressed in terms of the supremum of the errors. The dependency on the average error is important in problems with limited number of samples per iteration, for which the average of the errors can be signiﬁcantly smaller in size than the supremum of the errors. Based on these theoretical results, we prove that a sampling-based variant of DPP (DPP-RL) asymptotically converges to the optimal policy. Finally, we illustrate numerically the applicability of these results on some benchmark problems and compare the performance of the approximate variants of DPP with some existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods.

<p>Author: Timo Aho, Bernard Ženko, Sašo Džeroski, Tapio Elomaa</p><p>Abstract: Methods for learning decision rules are being successfully applied to many problem domains, in particular when understanding and interpretation of the learned model is necessary. In many real life problems, we would like to predict multiple related (nominal or numeric) target attributes simultaneously. While several methods for learning rules that predict multiple targets at once exist, they are all based on the covering algorithm, which does not work well for regression problems. A better solution for regression is the rule ensemble approach that transcribes an ensemble of decision trees into a large collection of rules. An optimization procedure is then used to select the best (and much smaller) subset of these rules and to determine their respective weights. We introduce the F IRE algorithm for solving multi-target regression problems, which employs the rule ensembles approach. We improve the accuracy of the algorithm by adding simple linear functions to the ensemble. We also extensively evaluate the algorithm with and without linear functions. The results show that the accuracy of multi-target regression rule ensembles is high. They are more accurate than, for instance, multi-target regression trees, but not quite as accurate as multi-target random forests. The rule ensembles are signiﬁcantly more concise than random forests, and it is also possible to create compact rule sets that are smaller than a single regression tree but still comparable in accuracy.

<p>Author: Alessandro Rinaldo, Aarti Singh, Rebecca Nugent, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: High density clusters can be characterized by the connected components of a level set L(λ) = {x : p(x) > λ} of the underlying probability density function p generating the data, at some appropriate level λ ≥ 0. The complete hierarchical clustering can be characterized by a cluster tree T = λ L(λ). In this paper, we study the behavior of a density level set estimate L(λ) and cluster tree estimate T based on a kernel density estimator with kernel bandwidth h. We deﬁne two notions of instability to measure the variability of L(λ) and T as a function of h, and investigate the theoretical properties of these instability measures.

<p>Author: Guo-Xun Yuan, Chia-Hua Ho, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Recently, Yuan et al. (2010) conducted a comprehensive comparison on software for L1-regularized classiﬁcation. They concluded that a carefully designed coordinate descent implementation CDN is the fastest among state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we point out that CDN is less competitive on loss functions that are expensive to compute. In particular, CDN for logistic regression is much slower than CDN for SVM because the logistic loss involves expensive exp/log operations. In optimization, Newton methods are known to have fewer iterations although each iteration costs more. Because solving the Newton sub-problem is independent of the loss calculation, this type of methods may surpass CDN under some circumstances. In L1-regularized classiﬁcation, GLMNET by Friedman et al. is already a Newton-type method, but experiments in Yuan et al. (2010) indicated that the existing GLMNET implementation may face difﬁculties for some largescale problems. In this paper, we propose an improved GLMNET to address some theoretical and implementation issues. In particular, as a Newton-type method, GLMNET achieves fast local convergence, but may fail to quickly obtain a useful solution. By a careful design to adjust the effort for each iteration, our method is efﬁcient for both loosely or strictly solving the optimization problem. Experiments demonstrate that our improved GLMNET is more efﬁcient than CDN for L1-regularized logistic regression.

<p>Author: José Hernández-Orallo, Peter Flach, Cèsar Ferri</p><p>Abstract: Many performance metrics have been introduced in the literature for the evaluation of classiﬁcation performance, each of them with different origins and areas of application. These metrics include accuracy, unweighted accuracy, the area under the ROC curve or the ROC convex hull, the mean absolute error and the Brier score or mean squared error (with its decomposition into reﬁnement and calibration). One way of understanding the relations among these metrics is by means of variable operating conditions (in the form of misclassiﬁcation costs and/or class distributions). Thus, a metric may correspond to some expected loss over different operating conditions. One dimension for the analysis has been the distribution for this range of operating conditions, leading to some important connections in the area of proper scoring rules. We demonstrate in this paper that there is an equally important dimension which has so far received much less attention in the analysis of performance metrics. This dimension is given by the decision rule, which is typically implemented as a threshold choice method when using scoring models. In this paper, we explore many old and new threshold choice methods: ﬁxed, score-uniform, score-driven, rate-driven and optimal, among others. By calculating the expected loss obtained with these threshold choice methods for a uniform range of operating conditions we give clear interpretations of the 0-1 loss, the absolute error, the Brier score, the AUC and the reﬁnement loss respectively. Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of performance metrics as well as a systematic approach to loss minimisation which can be summarised as follows: given a model, apply the threshold choice methods that correspond with the available information about the operating condition, and compare their expected losses. In order to assist in this procedure we also derive several connections between the aforementioned performance metrics, and we highlight the role of calibra</p><p>4 0.31745064 <a title="18-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2012-Large-scale_Linear_Support_Vector_Regression.html">54 jmlr-2012-Large-scale Linear Support Vector Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Chia-Hua Ho, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Support vector regression (SVR) and support vector classiﬁcation (SVC) are popular learning techniques, but their use with kernels is often time consuming. Recently, linear SVC without kernels has been shown to give competitive accuracy for some applications, but enjoys much faster training/testing. However, few studies have focused on linear SVR. In this paper, we extend state-of-theart training methods for linear SVC to linear SVR. We show that the extension is straightforward for some methods, but is not trivial for some others. Our experiments demonstrate that for some problems, the proposed linear-SVR training methods can very efﬁciently produce models that are as good as kernel SVR.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Claudio Gentile, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: We present a new online learning algorithm in the selective sampling framework, where labels must be actively queried before they are revealed. We prove bounds on the regret of our algorithm and on the number of labels it queries when faced with an adaptive adversarial strategy of generating the instances. Our bounds both generalize and strictly improve over previous bounds in similar settings. Additionally, our selective sampling algorithm can be converted into an efﬁcient statistical active learning algorithm. We extend our algorithm and analysis to the multiple-teacher setting, where the algorithm can choose which subset of teachers to query for each label. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques on a real-world Internet search problem.

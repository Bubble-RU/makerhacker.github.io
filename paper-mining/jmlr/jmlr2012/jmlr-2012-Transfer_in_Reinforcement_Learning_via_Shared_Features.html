<p>Author: Tobias Lang, Marc Toussaint, Kristian Kersting</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental problem in reinforcement learning is balancing exploration and exploitation. We address this problem in the context of model-based reinforcement learning in large stochastic relational domains by developing relational extensions of the concepts of the E 3 and R- MAX algorithms. Efﬁcient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efﬁciency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efﬁcient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions. Our results in noisy 3D simulated robot manipulation problems and in domains of the international planning competition demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing propositional and factored exploration techniques.

<p>Author: Aviv Tamar, Dotan Di Castro, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning an agent uses online feedback from the environment in order to adaptively select an effective policy. Model free approaches address this task by directly mapping environmental states to actions, while model based methods attempt to construct a model of the environment, followed by a selection of optimal actions based on that model. Given the complementary advantages of both approaches, we suggest a novel procedure which augments a model free algorithm with a partial model. The resulting hybrid algorithm switches between a model based and a model free mode, depending on the current state and the agent’s knowledge. Our method relies on a novel deﬁnition for a partially known model, and an estimator that incorporates such knowledge in order to reduce uncertainty in stochastic approximation iterations. We prove that such an approach leads to improved policy evaluation whenever environmental knowledge is available, without compromising performance when such knowledge is absent. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on policy gradient and Q-learning algorithms, and its usefulness in solving a call admission control problem.

<p>Author: Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar, Vicenç Gómez, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel policy iteration method, called dynamic policy programming (DPP), to estimate the optimal policy in the inﬁnite-horizon Markov decision processes. DPP is an incremental algorithm that forces a gradual change in policy update. This allows us to prove ﬁnite-iteration and asymptotic ℓ∞ -norm performance-loss bounds in the presence of approximation/estimation error which depend on the average accumulated error as opposed to the standard bounds which are expressed in terms of the supremum of the errors. The dependency on the average error is important in problems with limited number of samples per iteration, for which the average of the errors can be signiﬁcantly smaller in size than the supremum of the errors. Based on these theoretical results, we prove that a sampling-based variant of DPP (DPP-RL) asymptotically converges to the optimal policy. Finally, we illustrate numerically the applicability of these results on some benchmark problems and compare the performance of the approximate variants of DPP with some existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods.

<p>Author: Michael Brückner, Christian Kanzow, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: The standard assumption of identically distributed training and test data is violated when the test data are generated in response to the presence of a predictive model. This becomes apparent, for example, in the context of email spam ﬁltering. Here, email service providers employ spam ﬁlters, and spam senders engineer campaign templates to achieve a high rate of successful deliveries despite the ﬁlters. We model the interaction between the learner and the data generator as a static game in which the cost functions of the learner and the data generator are not necessarily antagonistic. We identify conditions under which this prediction game has a unique Nash equilibrium and derive algorithms that ﬁnd the equilibrial prediction model. We derive two instances, the Nash logistic regression and the Nash support vector machine, and empirically explore their properties in a case study on email spam ﬁltering.

<p>Author: Fei Yan, Josef Kittler, Krystian Mikolajczyk, Atif Tahir</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity-inducing multiple kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (MK-FDA) has been studied in the literature. Building on recent advances in non-sparse multiple kernel learning (MKL), we propose a non-sparse version of MK-FDA, which imposes a general ℓ p norm regularisation on the kernel weights. We formulate the associated optimisation problem as a semi-inﬁnite program (SIP), and adapt an iterative wrapper algorithm to solve it. We then discuss, in light of latest advances in MKL optimisation techniques, several reformulations and optimisation strategies that can potentially lead to signiﬁcant improvements in the efﬁciency and scalability of MK-FDA. We carry out extensive experiments on six datasets from various application areas, and compare closely the performance of ℓ p MK-FDA, ﬁxed norm MK-FDA, and several variants of SVM-based MKL (MK-SVM). Our results demonstrate that ℓ p MK-FDA improves upon sparse MK-FDA in many practical situations. The results also show that on image categorisation problems, ℓ p MK-FDA tends to outperform its SVM counterpart. Finally, we also discuss the connection between (MK-)FDA and (MK-)SVM, under the uniﬁed framework of regularised kernel machines.

<p>Author: Tobias Lang, Marc Toussaint, Kristian Kersting</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental problem in reinforcement learning is balancing exploration and exploitation. We address this problem in the context of model-based reinforcement learning in large stochastic relational domains by developing relational extensions of the concepts of the E 3 and R- MAX algorithms. Efﬁcient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efﬁciency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efﬁcient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions. Our results in noisy 3D simulated robot manipulation problems and in domains of the international planning competition demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing propositional and factored exploration techniques.

<p>Author: Hannes Nickisch</p><p>Abstract: The glm-ie toolbox contains functionality for estimation and inference in generalised linear models over continuous-valued variables. Besides a variety of penalised least squares solvers for estimation, it offers inference based on (convex) variational bounds, on expectation propagation and on factorial mean ﬁeld. Scalable and efﬁcient inference in fully-connected undirected graphical models or Markov random ﬁelds with Gaussian and non-Gaussian potentials is achieved by casting all the computations as matrix vector multiplications. We provide a wide choice of penalty functions for estimation, potential functions for inference and matrix classes with lazy evaluation for convenient modelling. We designed the glm-ie package to be simple, generic and easily expansible. Most of the code is written in Matlab including some MEX ﬁles to be fully compatible to both Matlab 7.x and GNU Octave 3.3.x. Large scale probabilistic classiﬁcation as well as sparse linear modelling can be performed in a common algorithmical framework by the glm-ie toolkit.

<p>Author: Zhuang Wang, Koby Crammer, Slobodan Vucetic</p><p>Abstract: Online algorithms that process one example at a time are advantageous when dealing with very large data or with data streams. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is such an algorithm and it is an attractive choice for online Support Vector Machine (SVM) training due to its simplicity and effectiveness. When equipped with kernel functions, similarly to other SVM learning algorithms, SGD is susceptible to the curse of kernelization that causes unbounded linear growth in model size and update time with data size. This may render SGD inapplicable to large data sets. We address this issue by presenting a class of Budgeted SGD (BSGD) algorithms for large-scale kernel SVM training which have constant space and constant time complexity per update. Speciﬁcally, BSGD keeps the number of support vectors bounded during training through several budget maintenance strategies. We treat the budget maintenance as a source of the gradient error, and show that the gap between the BSGD and the optimal SVM solutions depends on the model degradation due to budget maintenance. To minimize the gap, we study greedy budget maintenance methods based on removal, projection, and merging of support vectors. We propose budgeted versions of several popular online SVM algorithms that belong to the SGD family. We further derive BSGD algorithms for multi-class SVM training. Comprehensive empirical results show that BSGD achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art budgeted online algorithms and comparable to non-budget algorithms, while achieving impressive computational efﬁciency both in time and space during training and prediction.

<p>Author: Gérard Biau</p><p>Abstract: Random forests are a scheme proposed by Leo Breiman in the 2000’s for building a predictor ensemble with a set of decision trees that grow in randomly selected subspaces of data. Despite growing interest and practical use, there has been little exploration of the statistical properties of random forests, and little is known about the mathematical forces driving the algorithm. In this paper, we offer an in-depth analysis of a random forests model suggested by Breiman (2004), which is very close to the original algorithm. We show in particular that the procedure is consistent and adapts to sparsity, in the sense that its rate of convergence depends only on the number of strong features and not on how many noise variables are present.

<p>Author: Tuo Zhao, Han Liu, Kathryn Roeder, John Lafferty, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: We describe an R package named huge which provides easy-to-use functions for estimating high dimensional undirected graphs from data. This package implements recent results in the literature, including Friedman et al. (2007), Liu et al. (2009, 2012) and Liu et al. (2010). Compared with the existing graph estimation package glasso, the huge package provides extra features: (1) instead of using Fortan, it is written in C, which makes the code more portable and easier to modify; (2) besides ﬁtting Gaussian graphical models, it also provides functions for ﬁtting high dimensional semiparametric Gaussian copula models; (3) more functions like data-dependent model selection, data generation and graph visualization; (4) a minor convergence problem of the graphical lasso algorithm is corrected; (5) the package allows the user to apply both lossless and lossy screening rules to scale up large-scale problems, making a tradeoff between computational and statistical efﬁciency. Keywords: high-dimensional undirected graph estimation, glasso, huge, semiparametric graph estimation, data-dependent model selection, lossless screening, lossy screening 1. Overview Undirected graphs is a natural approach to describe the conditional independence among many variables. Each node of the graph represents a single variable and no edge between two variables implies that they are conditional independent given all other variables. In the past decade, significant progress has been made on designing efﬁcient algorithms to learn undirected graphs from high-dimensional observational data sets. Most of these methods are based on either the penalized maximum-likelihood estimation (Friedman et al., 2007) or penalized regression methods (Meinshausen and B¨ hlmann, 2006). Existing packages include glasso, Covpath and CLIME. In particuu ∗. Also in the Department of Biostatistics. †. Also in the Department of Machine Learning. c 2012 Zhao, Liu, Roeder, Lafferty and Wasserman. Z HAO , L IU , ROEDER , L AFFERTY AND WASSERMAN lar, the glasso package has been widely adopted by statisticians and computer scientists due to its friendly user-inference and efﬁciency. In this paper1 we describe a newly developed R package named huge (High-dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation) coded in C. The package includes a wide range of functional modules and addresses some drawbacks of the graphical lasso algorithm. To gain more scalability, the package supports two modes of screening, lossless (Witten et al., 2011) and lossy screening. When using lossy screening, the user can select the desired screening level to scale up for high-dimensional problems, but this introduces some estimation bias. 2. Software Design and Implementation The package huge aims to provide a general framework for high-dimensional undirected graph estimation. The package includes Six functional modules (M1-M6) facilitate a ﬂexible pipeline for analysis (Figure 1). M1. Data Generator: The function huge.generator() can simulate multivariate Gaussian data with different undirected graphs, including hub, cluster, band, scale-free, and Erd¨ s-R´ nyi o e random graphs. The sparsity level of the obtained graph and signal-to-noise ratio can also be set up by users. M2. Semiparametric Transformation: The function huge.npn() implements the nonparanormal method (Liu et al., 2009, 2012) for estimating a semiparametric Gaussian copula model.The nonparanormal family extends the Gaussian distribution by marginally transforming the variables. Computationally, the nonparanormal transformation only requires one pass through the data matrix. M3. Graph Screening: The scr argument in the main function huge() controls the use of largescale correlation screening before graph estimation. The function supports the lossless screening (Witten et al., 2011) and the lossy screening. Such screening procedures can greatly reduce the computational cost and achieve equal or even better estimation by reducing the variance at the expense of increased bias. Figure 1: The graph estimation pipeline. M4. Graph Estimation: Similar to the glasso package, the method argument in the huge() function supports two estimation methods: (i) the neighborhood pursuit algorithm (Meinshausen and B¨ hlmann, 2006) and (ii) the graphical lasso algorithm (Friedman et al., 2007). We apply u the coordinate descent with active set and covariance update, as well as other tricks suggested in Friedman et al. (2010). We modiﬁed the warm start trick to address the potential divergence problem of the graphical lasso algorithm (Mazumder and Hastie, 2011). The code is also memory-optimized using the sparse matrix data structure when estimating and storing full regularization paths for large 1. This paper is only a summary of the package huge. For more details please refer to the online vignette. 1060 H IGH - DIMENSIONAL U NDIRECTED G RAPH E STIMATION data sets. we also provide a complementary graph estimation method based on thresholding the sample correlation matrix, which is computationally efﬁcient and widely applied in biomedical research. M5. Model Selection: The function huge.select() provides two regularization parameter selection methods: the stability approach for regularization selection (StARS) (Liu et al., 2010); and rotation information criterion (RIC). We also provide a likelihood-based extended Bayesian information criterion. M6. Graph Visualization: The plotting functions huge.plot() and plot() provide visualizations of the simulated data sets, estimated graphs and paths. The implementation is based on the igraph package. 3. User Interface by Example We illustrate the user interface by analyzing a stock market data which we contribute to the huge package. We acquired closing prices from all stocks in the S&P; 500 for all the days that the market was open between Jan 1, 2003 and Jan 1, 2008. This gave us 1258 samples for the 452 stocks that remained in the S&P; 500 during the entire time period. > > > > > library(huge) data(stockdata) # Load the data x = log(stockdata$data[2:1258,]/stockdata$data[1:1257,]) # Preprocessing x.npn = huge.npn(x, npn.func=</p><p>5 0.03977026 <a title="19-tfidf-5" href="./jmlr-2012-Learning_Linear_Cyclic_Causal_Models_with_Latent_Variables.html">56 jmlr-2012-Learning Linear Cyclic Causal Models with Latent Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Mark Dredze, Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Conﬁdence-weighted online learning is a generalization of margin-based learning of linear classiﬁers in which the margin constraint is replaced by a probabilistic constraint based on a distribution over classiﬁer weights that is updated online as examples are observed. The distribution captures a notion of conﬁdence on classiﬁer weights, and in some cases it can also be interpreted as replacing a single learning rate by adaptive per-weight rates. Conﬁdence-weighted learning was motivated by the statistical properties of natural-language classiﬁcation tasks, where most of the informative features are relatively rare. We investigate several versions of conﬁdence-weighted learning that use a Gaussian distribution over weight vectors, updated at each observed example to achieve high probability of correct classiﬁcation for the example. Empirical evaluation on a range of textcategorization tasks show that our algorithms improve over other state-of-the-art online and batch methods, learn faster in the online setting, and lead to better classiﬁer combination for a type of distributed training commonly used in cloud computing.

<p>Author: Adrian Barbu, Nathan Lay</p><p>Abstract: Prediction markets are used in real life to predict outcomes of interest such as presidential elections. This paper presents a mathematical theory of artiﬁcial prediction markets for supervised learning of conditional probability estimators. The artiﬁcial prediction market is a novel method for fusing the prediction information of features or trained classiﬁers, where the fusion result is the contract price on the possible outcomes. The market can be trained online by updating the participants’ budgets using training examples. Inspired by the real prediction markets, the equations that govern the market are derived from simple and reasonable assumptions. Efﬁcient numerical algorithms are presented for solving these equations. The obtained artiﬁcial prediction market is shown to be a maximum likelihood estimator. It generalizes linear aggregation, existent in boosting and random forest, as well as logistic regression and some kernel methods. Furthermore, the market mechanism allows the aggregation of specialized classiﬁers that participate only on speciﬁc instances. Experimental comparisons show that the artiﬁcial prediction markets often outperform random forest and implicit online learning on synthetic data and real UCI data sets. Moreover, an extensive evaluation for pelvic and abdominal lymph node detection in CT data shows that the prediction market improves adaboost’s detection rate from 79.6% to 81.2% at 3 false positives/volume.

<p>Author: Konstantin Voevodski, Maria-Florina Balcan, Heiko Röglin, Shang-Hua Teng, Yu Xia</p><p>Abstract: Given a point set S and an unknown metric d on S, we study the problem of efﬁciently partitioning S into k clusters while querying few distances between the points. In our model we assume that we have access to one versus all queries that given a point s ∈ S return the distances between s and all other points. We show that given a natural assumption about the structure of the instance, we can efﬁciently ﬁnd an accurate clustering using only O(k) distance queries. Our algorithm uses an active selection strategy to choose a small set of points that we call landmarks, and considers only the distances between landmarks and other points to produce a clustering. We use our procedure to cluster proteins by sequence similarity. This setting nicely ﬁts our model because we can use a fast sequence database search program to query a sequence against an entire data set. We conduct an empirical study that shows that even though we query a small fraction of the distances between the points, we produce clusterings that are close to a desired clustering given by manual classiﬁcation.

<p>Author: Zhuang Wang, Koby Crammer, Slobodan Vucetic</p><p>Abstract: Online algorithms that process one example at a time are advantageous when dealing with very large data or with data streams. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is such an algorithm and it is an attractive choice for online Support Vector Machine (SVM) training due to its simplicity and effectiveness. When equipped with kernel functions, similarly to other SVM learning algorithms, SGD is susceptible to the curse of kernelization that causes unbounded linear growth in model size and update time with data size. This may render SGD inapplicable to large data sets. We address this issue by presenting a class of Budgeted SGD (BSGD) algorithms for large-scale kernel SVM training which have constant space and constant time complexity per update. Speciﬁcally, BSGD keeps the number of support vectors bounded during training through several budget maintenance strategies. We treat the budget maintenance as a source of the gradient error, and show that the gap between the BSGD and the optimal SVM solutions depends on the model degradation due to budget maintenance. To minimize the gap, we study greedy budget maintenance methods based on removal, projection, and merging of support vectors. We propose budgeted versions of several popular online SVM algorithms that belong to the SGD family. We further derive BSGD algorithms for multi-class SVM training. Comprehensive empirical results show that BSGD achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art budgeted online algorithms and comparable to non-budget algorithms, while achieving impressive computational efﬁciency both in time and space during training and prediction.

<p>Author: Michael Brückner, Christian Kanzow, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: The standard assumption of identically distributed training and test data is violated when the test data are generated in response to the presence of a predictive model. This becomes apparent, for example, in the context of email spam ﬁltering. Here, email service providers employ spam ﬁlters, and spam senders engineer campaign templates to achieve a high rate of successful deliveries despite the ﬁlters. We model the interaction between the learner and the data generator as a static game in which the cost functions of the learner and the data generator are not necessarily antagonistic. We identify conditions under which this prediction game has a unique Nash equilibrium and derive algorithms that ﬁnd the equilibrial prediction model. We derive two instances, the Nash logistic regression and the Nash support vector machine, and empirically explore their properties in a case study on email spam ﬁltering.

<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Amr Ahmed, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: A supervised topic model can use side information such as ratings or labels associated with documents or images to discover more predictive low dimensional topical representations of the data. However, existing supervised topic models predominantly employ likelihood-driven objective functions for learning and inference, leaving the popular and potentially powerful max-margin principle unexploited for seeking predictive representations of data and more discriminative topic bases for the corpus. In this paper, we propose the maximum entropy discrimination latent Dirichlet allocation (MedLDA) model, which integrates the mechanism behind the max-margin prediction models (e.g., SVMs) with the mechanism behind the hierarchical Bayesian topic models (e.g., LDA) under a uniﬁed constrained optimization framework, and yields latent topical representations that are more discriminative and more suitable for prediction tasks such as document classiﬁcation or regression. The principle underlying the MedLDA formalism is quite general and can be applied for jointly max-margin and maximum likelihood learning of directed or undirected topic models when supervising side information is available. Efﬁcient variational methods for posterior inference and parameter estimation are derived and extensive empirical studies on several real data sets are also provided. Our experimental results demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that MedLDA could: 1) discover sparse and highly discriminative topical representations; 2) achieve state of the art prediction performance; and 3) be more efﬁcient than existing supervised topic models, especially for classiﬁcation.

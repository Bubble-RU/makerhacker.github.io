<p>Author: Ji Liu, Peter Wonka, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the following sparse signal recovery (or feature selection) problem: given a design matrix X ∈ Rn×m (m ≫ n) and a noisy observation vector y ∈ Rn satisfying y = Xβ∗ + ε where ε is the noise vector following a Gaussian distribution N(0, σ2 I), how to recover the signal (or parameter vector) β∗ when the signal is sparse? The Dantzig selector has been proposed for sparse signal recovery with strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage Dantzig selector method, which iteratively reﬁnes the target signal β∗ . We show that if X obeys a certain condition, then with a large probability ˆ the difference between the solution β estimated by the proposed method and the true solution β∗ measured in terms of the ℓ p norm (p ≥ 1) is bounded as ˆ β − β∗ p ≤ C(s − N)1/p log m + ∆ σ, where C is a constant, s is the number of nonzero entries in β∗ , the risk of the oracle estimator ∆ is independent of m and is much smaller than the ﬁrst term, and N is the number of entries of β∗ larger √ than a certain value in the order of O (σ log m). The proposed √ method improves the estimation √ bound of the standard Dantzig selector approximately from Cs1/p log mσ to C(s − N)1/p log mσ where the value N depends on the number of large entries in β∗ . When N = s, the proposed algorithm achieves the oracle solution with a high probability, where the oracle solution is the projection of the observation vector y onto true features. In addition, with a large probability, the proposed method can select the same number of correct features under a milder condition than the Dantzig selector. Finally, we extend this multi-stage procedure to the LASSO case.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Claudio Gentile, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: We present a new online learning algorithm in the selective sampling framework, where labels must be actively queried before they are revealed. We prove bounds on the regret of our algorithm and on the number of labels it queries when faced with an adaptive adversarial strategy of generating the instances. Our bounds both generalize and strictly improve over previous bounds in similar settings. Additionally, our selective sampling algorithm can be converted into an efﬁcient statistical active learning algorithm. We extend our algorithm and analysis to the multiple-teacher setting, where the algorithm can choose which subset of teachers to query for each label.

<p>Author: Matus Telgarsky</p><p>Abstract: Boosting combines weak learners into a predictor with low empirical risk. Its dual constructs a high entropy distribution upon which weak learners and training labels are uncorrelated. This manuscript studies this primal-dual relationship under a broad family of losses, including the exponential loss of AdaBoost and the logistic loss, revealing: • Weak learnability aids the whole loss family: for any ε > 0, O (ln(1/ε)) iterations sufﬁce to produce a predictor with empirical risk ε-close to the inﬁmum; • The circumstances granting the existence of an empirical risk minimizer may be characterized in terms of the primal and dual problems, yielding a new proof of the known rate O (ln(1/ε)); • Arbitrary instances may be decomposed into the above two, granting rate O (1/ε), with a matching lower bound provided for the logistic loss.

<p>Author: Nir Ailon</p><p>Abstract: Given a set V of n elements we wish to linearly order them given pairwise preference labels which may be non-transitive (due to irrationality or arbitrary noise). The goal is to linearly order the elements while disagreeing with as few pairwise preference labels as possible. Our performance is measured by two parameters: The number of disagreements (loss) and the query complexity (number of pairwise preference labels). Our algorithm adaptively queries at most O(ε−6 n log5 n) preference labels for a regret of ε times the optimal loss. As a function of n, this is asymptotically better than standard (non-adaptive) learning bounds achievable for the same problem. Our main result takes us a step closer toward settling an open problem posed by learning-torank (from pairwise information) theoreticians and practitioners: What is a provably correct way to sample preference labels? To further show the power and practicality of our solution, we analyze a typical test case in which a large margin linear relaxation is used for efﬁciently solving the simpler learning problems in our decomposition.

<p>Author: Stanislav Minsker</p><p>Abstract: We present a new active learning algorithm based on nonparametric estimators of the regression function. Our investigation provides probabilistic bounds for the rates of convergence of the generalization error achievable by proposed method over a broad class of underlying distributions. We also prove minimax lower bounds which show that the obtained rates are almost tight.

<p>Author: Blaine Nelson, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein, Ling Huang, Anthony D. Joseph, Steven J. Lee, Satish Rao, J. D. Tygar</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁers are often used to detect miscreant activities. We study how an adversary can systematically query a classiﬁer to elicit information that allows the attacker to evade detection while incurring a near-minimal cost of modifying their intended malfeasance. We generalize the theory of Lowd and Meek (2005) to the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers that partition their feature space into two sets, one of which is convex. We present query algorithms for this family that construct undetected instances of approximately minimal cost using only polynomially-many queries in the dimension of the space and in the level of approximation. Our results demonstrate that nearoptimal evasion can be accomplished for this family without reverse engineering the classiﬁer’s decision boundary. We also consider general ℓ p costs and show that near-optimal evasion on the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers is generally efﬁcient for both positive and negative convexity for all levels of approximation if p = 1.

<p>Author: Mario Frank, Andreas P. Streich, David Basin, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic model for clustering Boolean data where an object can be simultaneously assigned to multiple clusters. By explicitly modeling the underlying generative process that combines the individual source emissions, highly structured data are expressed with substantially fewer clusters compared to single-assignment clustering. As a consequence, such a model provides robust parameter estimators even when the number of samples is low. We extend the model with different noise processes and demonstrate that maximum-likelihood estimation with multiple assignments consistently infers source parameters more accurately than single-assignment clustering. Our model is primarily motivated by the task of role mining for role-based access control, where users of a system are assigned one or more roles. In experiments with real-world access-control data, our model exhibits better generalization performance than state-of-the-art approaches.

<p>Author: Ji Liu, Peter Wonka, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the following sparse signal recovery (or feature selection) problem: given a design matrix X ∈ Rn×m (m ≫ n) and a noisy observation vector y ∈ Rn satisfying y = Xβ∗ + ε where ε is the noise vector following a Gaussian distribution N(0, σ2 I), how to recover the signal (or parameter vector) β∗ when the signal is sparse? The Dantzig selector has been proposed for sparse signal recovery with strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage Dantzig selector method, which iteratively reﬁnes the target signal β∗ . We show that if X obeys a certain condition, then with a large probability ˆ the difference between the solution β estimated by the proposed method and the true solution β∗ measured in terms of the ℓ p norm (p ≥ 1) is bounded as ˆ β − β∗ p ≤ C(s − N)1/p log m + ∆ σ, where C is a constant, s is the number of nonzero entries in β∗ , the risk of the oracle estimator ∆ is independent of m and is much smaller than the ﬁrst term, and N is the number of entries of β∗ larger √ than a certain value in the order of O (σ log m). The proposed √ method improves the estimation √ bound of the standard Dantzig selector approximately from Cs1/p log mσ to C(s − N)1/p log mσ where the value N depends on the number of large entries in β∗ . When N = s, the proposed algorithm achieves the oracle solution with a high probability, where the oracle solution is the projection of the observation vector y onto true features. In addition, with a large probability, the proposed method can select the same number of correct features under a milder condition than the Dantzig selector. Finally, we extend this multi-stage procedure to the LASSO case.

<p>Author: Michael Brückner, Christian Kanzow, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: The standard assumption of identically distributed training and test data is violated when the test data are generated in response to the presence of a predictive model. This becomes apparent, for example, in the context of email spam ﬁltering. Here, email service providers employ spam ﬁlters, and spam senders engineer campaign templates to achieve a high rate of successful deliveries despite the ﬁlters. We model the interaction between the learner and the data generator as a static game in which the cost functions of the learner and the data generator are not necessarily antagonistic. We identify conditions under which this prediction game has a unique Nash equilibrium and derive algorithms that ﬁnd the equilibrial prediction model. We derive two instances, the Nash logistic regression and the Nash support vector machine, and empirically explore their properties in a case study on email spam ﬁltering.

<p>Author: Gavin Brown, Adam Pocock, Ming-Jie Zhao, Mikel Luján</p><p>Abstract: We present a unifying framework for information theoretic feature selection, bringing almost two decades of research on heuristic ﬁlter criteria under a single theoretical interpretation. This is in response to the question: “what are the implicit statistical assumptions of feature selection criteria based on mutual information?”. To answer this, we adopt a different strategy than is usual in the feature selection literature—instead of trying to deﬁne a criterion, we derive one, directly from a clearly speciﬁed objective function: the conditional likelihood of the training labels. While many hand-designed heuristic criteria try to optimize a deﬁnition of feature ‘relevancy’ and ‘redundancy’, our approach leads to a probabilistic framework which naturally incorporates these concepts. As a result we can unify the numerous criteria published over the last two decades, and show them to be low-order approximations to the exact (but intractable) optimisation problem. The primary contribution is to show that common heuristics for information based feature selection (including Markov Blanket algorithms as a special case) are approximate iterative maximisers of the conditional likelihood. A large empirical study provides strong evidence to favour certain classes of criteria, in particular those that balance the relative size of the relevancy/redundancy terms. Overall we conclude that the JMI criterion (Yang and Moody, 1999; Meyer et al., 2008) provides the best tradeoff in terms of accuracy, stability, and ﬂexibility with small data samples.

<p>Author: Jian Huang, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The ℓ1 -penalized method, or the Lasso, has emerged as an important tool for the analysis of large data sets. Many important results have been obtained for the Lasso in linear regression which have led to a deeper understanding of high-dimensional statistical problems. In this article, we consider a class of weighted ℓ1 -penalized estimators for convex loss functions of a general form, including the generalized linear models. We study the estimation, prediction, selection and sparsity properties of the weighted ℓ1 -penalized estimator in sparse, high-dimensional settings where the number of predictors p can be much larger than the sample size n. Adaptive Lasso is considered as a special case. A multistage method is developed to approximate concave regularized estimation by applying an adaptive Lasso recursively. We provide prediction and estimation oracle inequalities for single- and multi-stage estimators, a general selection consistency theorem, and an upper bound for the dimension of the Lasso estimator. Important models including the linear regression, logistic regression and log-linear models are used throughout to illustrate the applications of the general results.

<p>Author: Andreas Maurer, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We present a data dependent generalization bound for a large class of regularized algorithms which implement structured sparsity constraints. The bound can be applied to standard squared-norm regularization, the Lasso, the group Lasso, some versions of the group Lasso with overlapping groups, multiple kernel learning and other regularization schemes. In all these cases competitive results are obtained. A novel feature of our bound is that it can be applied in an inﬁnite dimensional setting such as the Lasso in a separable Hilbert space or multiple kernel learning with a countable number of kernels.

<p>Author: Michael U. Gutmann, Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: We consider the task of estimating, from observed data, a probabilistic model that is parameterized by a ﬁnite number of parameters. In particular, we are considering the situation where the model probability density function is unnormalized. That is, the model is only speciﬁed up to the partition function. The partition function normalizes a model so that it integrates to one for any choice of the parameters. However, it is often impossible to obtain it in closed form. Gibbs distributions, Markov and multi-layer networks are examples of models where analytical normalization is often impossible. Maximum likelihood estimation can then not be used without resorting to numerical approximations which are often computationally expensive. We propose here a new objective function for the estimation of both normalized and unnormalized models. The basic idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artiﬁcially generated noise. With this approach, the normalizing partition function can be estimated like any other parameter. We prove that the new estimation method leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters. For large noise sample sizes, the new estimator is furthermore shown to behave like the maximum likelihood estimator. In the estimation of unnormalized models, there is a trade-off between statistical and computational performance. We show that the new method strikes a competitive trade-off in comparison to other estimation methods for unnormalized models. As an application to real data, we estimate novel two-layer models of natural image statistics with spline nonlinearities.

<p>Author: Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar, Vicenç Gómez, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel policy iteration method, called dynamic policy programming (DPP), to estimate the optimal policy in the inﬁnite-horizon Markov decision processes. DPP is an incremental algorithm that forces a gradual change in policy update. This allows us to prove ﬁnite-iteration and asymptotic ℓ∞ -norm performance-loss bounds in the presence of approximation/estimation error which depend on the average accumulated error as opposed to the standard bounds which are expressed in terms of the supremum of the errors. The dependency on the average error is important in problems with limited number of samples per iteration, for which the average of the errors can be signiﬁcantly smaller in size than the supremum of the errors. Based on these theoretical results, we prove that a sampling-based variant of DPP (DPP-RL) asymptotically converges to the optimal policy. Finally, we illustrate numerically the applicability of these results on some benchmark problems and compare the performance of the approximate variants of DPP with some existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods.

<p>Author: Christopher R. Genovese, Jiashun Jin, Larry Wasserman, Zhigang Yao</p><p>Abstract: The lasso is an important method for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems, with efﬁcient algorithms available, a long history of practical success, and a large body of theoretical results supporting and explaining its performance. But even with the best available algorithms, ﬁnding the lasso solutions remains a computationally challenging task in cases where the number of covariates vastly exceeds the number of data points. Marginal regression, where each dependent variable is regressed separately on each covariate, offers a promising alternative in this case because the estimates can be computed roughly two orders faster than the lasso solutions. The question that remains is how the statistical performance of the method compares to that of the lasso in these cases. In this paper, we study the relative statistical performance of the lasso and marginal regression for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems. We consider the problem of learning which coefﬁcients are non-zero. Our main results are as follows: (i) we compare the conditions under which the lasso and marginal regression guarantee exact recovery in the ﬁxed design, noise free case; (ii) we establish conditions under which marginal regression provides exact recovery with high probability in the ﬁxed design, noise free, random coefﬁcients case; and (iii) we derive rates of convergence for both procedures, where performance is measured by the number of coefﬁcients with incorrect sign, and characterize the regions in the parameter space recovery is and is not possible under this metric. In light of the computational advantages of marginal regression in very high dimensional problems, our theoretical and simulations results suggest that the procedure merits further study.

<p>Author: Kian Ming A. Chai</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian process prior with an appropriate likelihood function is a ﬂexible non-parametric model for a variety of learning tasks. One important and standard task is multi-class classiﬁcation, which is the categorization of an item into one of several ﬁxed classes. A usual likelihood function for this is the multinomial logistic likelihood function. However, exact inference with this model has proved to be difﬁcult because high-dimensional integrations are required. In this paper, we propose a variational approximation to this model, and we describe the optimization of the variational parameters. Experiments have shown our approximation to be tight. In addition, we provide dataindependent bounds on the marginal likelihood of the model, one of which is shown to be much tighter than the existing variational mean-ﬁeld bound in the experiments. We also derive a proper lower bound on the predictive likelihood that involves the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximating and the true posterior. We combine our approach with a recently proposed sparse approximation to give a variational sparse approximation to the Gaussian process multi-class model. We also derive criteria which can be used to select the inducing set, and we show the effectiveness of these criteria over random selection in an experiment.

<p>Author: Zhiwei Qin, Donald Goldfarb</p><p>Abstract: We consider a class of sparse learning problems in high dimensional feature space regularized by a structured sparsity-inducing norm that incorporates prior knowledge of the group structure of the features. Such problems often pose a considerable challenge to optimization algorithms due to the non-smoothness and non-separability of the regularization term. In this paper, we focus on two commonly adopted sparsity-inducing regularization terms, the overlapping Group Lasso penalty l1 /l2 -norm and the l1 /l∞ -norm. We propose a uniﬁed framework based on the augmented Lagrangian method, under which problems with both types of regularization and their variants can be efﬁciently solved. As one of the core building-blocks of this framework, we develop new algorithms using a partial-linearization/splitting technique and prove that the accelerated versions 1 of these algorithms require O( √ε ) iterations to obtain an ε-optimal solution. We compare the performance of these algorithms against that of the alternating direction augmented Lagrangian and FISTA methods on a collection of data sets and apply them to two real-world problems to compare the relative merits of the two norms.

<p>Author: Marinka Žitnik, Blaž Zupan</p><p>Abstract: NIMFA is an open-source Python library that provides a uniﬁed interface to nonnegative matrix factorization algorithms. It includes implementations of state-of-the-art factorization methods, initialization approaches, and quality scoring. It supports both dense and sparse matrix representation. NIMFA’s component-based implementation and hierarchical design should help the users to employ already implemented techniques or design and code new strategies for matrix factorization tasks.

<p>Author: Grigorios Skolidis, Guido Sanguinetti</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel model for meta-generalisation, that is, performing prediction on novel tasks based on information from multiple different but related tasks. The model is based on two coupled Gaussian processes with structured covariance function; one model performs predictions by learning a constrained covariance function encapsulating the relations between the various training tasks, while the second model determines the similarity of new tasks to previously seen tasks. We demonstrate empirically on several real and synthetic data sets both the strengths of the approach and its limitations due to the distributional assumptions underpinning it.

<p>Author: Yongdai Kim, Sunghoon Kwon, Hosik Choi</p><p>Abstract: Asymptotic properties of model selection criteria for high-dimensional regression models are studied where the dimension of covariates is much larger than the sample size. Several sufﬁcient conditions for model selection consistency are provided. Non-Gaussian error distributions are considered and it is shown that the maximal number of covariates for model selection consistency depends on the tail behavior of the error distribution. Also, sufﬁcient conditions for model selection consistency are given when the variance of the noise is neither known nor estimated consistently. Results of simulation studies as well as real data analysis are given to illustrate that ﬁnite sample performances of consistent model selection criteria can be quite different.

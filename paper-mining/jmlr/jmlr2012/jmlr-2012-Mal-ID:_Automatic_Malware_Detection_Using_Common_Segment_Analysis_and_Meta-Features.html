<h1>63 jmlr-2012-Mal-ID: Automatic Malware Detection Using Common Segment Analysis and Meta-Features</h1>

<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Pavel Laskov</p><p>Abstract: Security issues are crucial in a number of machine learning applications, especially in scenarios dealing with human activity rather than natural phenomena (e.g., information ranking, spam detection, malware detection, etc.). In such cases, learning algorithms may have to cope with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some previous work addressed the issue of handling malicious data in the context of supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution,1 we analyze the performance of a particular method—online centroid anomaly detection—in the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes, derivation of an optimal attack, and analysis of attack efﬁciency and limitations. We derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid anomaly detection under different conditions: attacker’s full or limited control over the trafﬁc and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be made arbitrarily difﬁcult (a strict upper bound on the attacker’s gain) if external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation, carried out on real traces of HTTP and exploit trafﬁc, conﬁrms the tightness of our theoretical bounds and the practicality of our protection mechanisms.

<p>Author: Konrad Rieck, Christian Wressnegger, Alexander Bikadorov</p><p>Abstract: Strings and sequences are ubiquitous in many areas of data analysis. However, only few learning methods can be directly applied to this form of data. We present Sally, a tool for embedding strings in vector spaces that allows for applying a wide range of learning methods to string data. Sally implements a generalized form of the bag-of-words model, where strings are mapped to a vector space that is spanned by a set of string features, such as words or n-grams of words. The implementation of Sally builds on efﬁcient string algorithms and enables processing millions of strings and features. The tool supports several data formats and is capable of interfacing with common learning environments, such as Weka, Shogun, Matlab, or Pylab. Sally has been successfully applied for learning with natural language text, DNA sequences and monitored program behavior.

<p>Author: Stephen R. Piccolo, Lewis J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by a need to classify high-dimensional, heterogeneous data from the bioinformatics domain, we developed ML-Flex, a machine-learning toolbox that enables users to perform two-class and multi-class classiﬁcation analyses in a systematic yet ﬂexible manner. ML-Flex was written in Java but is capable of interfacing with third-party packages written in other programming languages. It can handle multiple input-data formats and supports a variety of customizations. MLFlex provides implementations of various validation strategies, which can be executed in parallel across multiple computing cores, processors, and nodes. Additionally, ML-Flex supports aggregating evidence across multiple algorithms and data sets via ensemble learning.

It presents three types of sub-units for consideration; those learnt from appearance data as well as those inferred from both 2D or 3D tracking data. These sub-units are then combined using a sign level classiﬁer; here, two options are presented. The ﬁrst uses Markov Models to encode the temporal changes between sub-units. The second makes use of Sequential Pattern Boosting to apply discriminative feature selection at the same time as encoding temporal information. This approach is more robust to noise and performs well in signer independent tests, improving results from the 54% achieved by the Markov Chains to 76%.

<p>Author: Gil Tahan, Lior Rokach, Yuval Shahar</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes several novel methods, based on machine learning, to detect malware in executable ﬁles without any need for preprocessing, such as unpacking or disassembling. The basic method (Mal-ID) is a new static (form-based) analysis methodology that uses common segment analysis in order to detect malware ﬁles. By using common segment analysis, Mal-ID is able to discard malware parts that originate from benign code. In addition, Mal-ID uses a new kind of feature, termed meta-feature, to better capture the properties of the analyzed segments. Rather than using the entire ﬁle, as is usually the case with machine learning based techniques, the new approach detects malware on the segment level. This study also introduces two Mal-ID extensions that improve the Mal-ID basic method in various aspects. We rigorously evaluated Mal-ID and its two extensions with more than ten performance measures, and compared them to the highly rated boosted decision tree method under identical settings. The evaluation demonstrated that Mal-ID and the two Mal-ID extensions outperformed the boosted decision tree method in almost all respects. In addition, the results indicated that by extracting meaningful features, it is sufﬁcient to employ one simple detection rule for classifying executable ﬁles.

<p>Author: Uri Shalit, Daphna Weinshall, Gal Chechik</p><p>Abstract: When learning models that are represented in matrix forms, enforcing a low-rank constraint can dramatically improve the memory and run time complexity, while providing a natural regularization of the model. However, naive approaches to minimizing functions over the set of low-rank matrices are either prohibitively time consuming (repeated singular value decomposition of the matrix) or numerically unstable (optimizing a factored representation of the low-rank matrix). We build on recent advances in optimization over manifolds, and describe an iterative online learning procedure, consisting of a gradient step, followed by a second-order retraction back to the manifold. While the ideal retraction is costly to compute, and so is the projection operator that approximates it, we describe another retraction that can be computed efﬁciently. It has run time and memory complexity of O ((n + m)k) for a rank-k matrix of dimension m × n, when using an online procedure with rank-one gradients. We use this algorithm, L ORETA, to learn a matrix-form similarity measure over pairs of documents represented as high dimensional vectors. L ORETA improves the mean average precision over a passive-aggressive approach in a factorized model, and also improves over a full model trained on pre-selected features using the same memory requirements. We further adapt L ORETA to learn positive semi-deﬁnite low-rank matrices, providing an online algorithm for low-rank metric learning. L ORETA also shows consistent improvement over standard weakly supervised methods in a large (1600 classes and 1 million images, using ImageNet) multi-label image classiﬁcation task.

<p>Author: Benedict C. May, Nathan Korda, Anthony Lee, David S. Leslie</p><p>Abstract: In sequential decision problems in an unknown environment, the decision maker often faces a dilemma over whether to explore to discover more about the environment, or to exploit current knowledge. We address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in a general setting encompassing both standard and contextualised bandit problems. The contextual bandit problem has recently resurfaced in attempts to maximise click-through rates in web based applications, a task with signiﬁcant commercial interest. In this article we consider an approach of Thompson (1933) which makes use of samples from the posterior distributions for the instantaneous value of each action. We extend the approach by introducing a new algorithm, Optimistic Bayesian Sampling (OBS), in which the probability of playing an action increases with the uncertainty in the estimate of the action value. This results in better directed exploratory behaviour. We prove that, under unrestrictive assumptions, both approaches result in optimal behaviour with respect to the average reward criterion of Yang and Zhu (2002). We implement OBS and measure its performance in simulated Bernoulli bandit and linear regression domains, and also when tested with the task of personalised news article recommendation on a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module data set. We ﬁnd that OBS performs competitively when compared to recently proposed benchmark algorithms and outperforms Thompson’s method throughout.

<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Amr Ahmed, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: A supervised topic model can use side information such as ratings or labels associated with documents or images to discover more predictive low dimensional topical representations of the data. However, existing supervised topic models predominantly employ likelihood-driven objective functions for learning and inference, leaving the popular and potentially powerful max-margin principle unexploited for seeking predictive representations of data and more discriminative topic bases for the corpus. In this paper, we propose the maximum entropy discrimination latent Dirichlet allocation (MedLDA) model, which integrates the mechanism behind the max-margin prediction models (e.g., SVMs) with the mechanism behind the hierarchical Bayesian topic models (e.g., LDA) under a uniﬁed constrained optimization framework, and yields latent topical representations that are more discriminative and more suitable for prediction tasks such as document classiﬁcation or regression. The principle underlying the MedLDA formalism is quite general and can be applied for jointly max-margin and maximum likelihood learning of directed or undirected topic models when supervising side information is available. Efﬁcient variational methods for posterior inference and parameter estimation are derived and extensive empirical studies on several real data sets are also provided. Our experimental results demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that MedLDA could: 1) discover sparse and highly discriminative topical representations; 2) achieve state of the art prediction performance; and 3) be more efﬁcient than existing supervised topic models, especially for classiﬁcation.

<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Rong Jin, Tianbao Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose efﬁcient algorithms for solving constrained online convex optimization problems. Our motivation stems from the observation that most algorithms proposed for online convex optimization require a projection onto the convex set K from which the decisions are made. While the projection is straightforward for simple shapes (e.g., Euclidean ball), for arbitrary complex sets it is the main computational challenge and may be inefﬁcient in practice. In this paper, we consider an alternative online convex optimization problem. Instead of requiring that decisions belong to K for all rounds, we only require that the constraints, which deﬁne the set K , be satisﬁed in the long run. By turning the problem into an online convex-concave optimization problem, √ we propose an efﬁcient algorithm which achieves O( T ) regret bound and O(T 3/4 ) bound on the violation of constraints. Then, we modify the algorithm in order to guarantee that the constraints are satisﬁed in the long run. This gain is achieved at the price of getting O(T 3/4 ) regret bound. Our second algorithm is based on the mirror prox method (Nemirovski, 2005) to solve variational inequalities which achieves O(T 2/3 ) bound for both regret and the violation of constraints when the domain K can be described by a ﬁnite number of linear constraints. Finally, we extend the results to the setting where we only have partial access to the convex set K and propose a multipoint bandit feedback algorithm with the same bounds in expectation as our ﬁrst algorithm.

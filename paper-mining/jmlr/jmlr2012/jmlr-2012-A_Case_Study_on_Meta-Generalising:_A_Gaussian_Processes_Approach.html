<p>Author: Kian Ming A. Chai</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian process prior with an appropriate likelihood function is a ﬂexible non-parametric model for a variety of learning tasks. One important and standard task is multi-class classiﬁcation, which is the categorization of an item into one of several ﬁxed classes. A usual likelihood function for this is the multinomial logistic likelihood function. However, exact inference with this model has proved to be difﬁcult because high-dimensional integrations are required. In this paper, we propose a variational approximation to this model, and we describe the optimization of the variational parameters. Experiments have shown our approximation to be tight. In addition, we provide dataindependent bounds on the marginal likelihood of the model, one of which is shown to be much tighter than the existing variational mean-ﬁeld bound in the experiments. We also derive a proper lower bound on the predictive likelihood that involves the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximating and the true posterior. We combine our approach with a recently proposed sparse approximation to give a variational sparse approximation to the Gaussian process multi-class model. We also derive criteria which can be used to select the inducing set, and we show the effectiveness of these criteria over random selection in an experiment.

<p>Author: Philipp Hennig, Christian J. Schuler</p><p>Abstract: Contemporary global optimization algorithms are based on local measures of utility, rather than a probability measure over location and value of the optimum. They thus attempt to collect low function values, not to learn about the optimum. The reason for the absence of probabilistic global optimizers is that the corresponding inference problem is intractable in several ways. This paper develops desiderata for probabilistic optimization algorithms, then presents a concrete algorithm which addresses each of the computational intractabilities with a sequence of approximations and explicitly addresses the decision problem of maximizing information gain from each evaluation.

<p>Author: Carl Brunner, Andreas Fischer, Klaus Luig, Thorsten Thies</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise classiﬁcation is the task to predict whether the examples a, b of a pair (a, b) belong to the same class or to different classes. In particular, interclass generalization problems can be treated in this way. In pairwise classiﬁcation, the order of the two input examples should not affect the classiﬁcation result. To achieve this, particular kernels as well as the use of symmetric training sets in the framework of support vector machines were suggested. The paper discusses both approaches in a general way and establishes a strong connection between them. In addition, an efﬁcient implementation is discussed which allows the training of several millions of pairs. The value of these contributions is conﬁrmed by excellent results on the labeled faces in the wild benchmark.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Claudio Gentile, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: We present a new online learning algorithm in the selective sampling framework, where labels must be actively queried before they are revealed. We prove bounds on the regret of our algorithm and on the number of labels it queries when faced with an adaptive adversarial strategy of generating the instances. Our bounds both generalize and strictly improve over previous bounds in similar settings. Additionally, our selective sampling algorithm can be converted into an efﬁcient statistical active learning algorithm. We extend our algorithm and analysis to the multiple-teacher setting, where the algorithm can choose which subset of teachers to query for each label. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques on a real-world Internet search problem.

<p>Author: George Konidaris, Ilya Scheidwasser, Andrew Barto</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for transfer in reinforcement learning based on the idea that related tasks share some common features, and that transfer can be achieved via those shared features. The framework attempts to capture the notion of tasks that are related but distinct, and provides some insight into when transfer can be usefully applied to a problem sequence and when it cannot. We apply the framework to the knowledge transfer problem, and show that an agent can learn a portable shaping function from experience in a sequence of tasks to signiﬁcantly improve performance in a later related task, even given a very brief training period. We also apply the framework to skill transfer, to show that agents can learn portable skills across a sequence of tasks that signiﬁcantly improve performance on later related tasks, approaching the performance of agents given perfectly learned problem-speciﬁc skills.

<p>Author: Ioannis Tsamardinos, Sofia Triantafillou, Vincenzo Lagani</p><p>Abstract: We present methods able to predict the presence and strength of conditional and unconditional dependencies (correlations) between two variables Y and Z never jointly measured on the same samples, based on multiple data sets measuring a set of common variables. The algorithms are specializations of prior work on learning causal structures from overlapping variable sets. This problem has also been addressed in the ﬁeld of statistical matching. The proposed methods are applied to a wide range of domains and are shown to accurately predict the presence of thousands of dependencies. Compared against prototypical statistical matching algorithms and within the scope of our experiments, the proposed algorithms make predictions that are better correlated with the sample estimates of the unknown parameters on test data ; this is particularly the case when the number of commonly measured variables is low. The enabling idea behind the methods is to induce one or all causal models that are simultaneously consistent with (ﬁt) all available data sets and prior knowledge and reason with them. This allows constraints stemming from causal assumptions (e.g., Causal Markov Condition, Faithfulness) to propagate. Several methods have been developed based on this idea, for which we propose the unifying name Integrative Causal Analysis (INCA). A contrived example is presented demonstrating the theoretical potential to develop more general methods for co-analyzing heterogeneous data sets. The computational experiments with the novel methods provide evidence that causallyinspired assumptions such as Faithfulness often hold to a good degree of approximation in many real systems and could be exploited for statistical inference.

<p>Author: Zhiwei Qin, Donald Goldfarb</p><p>Abstract: We consider a class of sparse learning problems in high dimensional feature space regularized by a structured sparsity-inducing norm that incorporates prior knowledge of the group structure of the features. Such problems often pose a considerable challenge to optimization algorithms due to the non-smoothness and non-separability of the regularization term. In this paper, we focus on two commonly adopted sparsity-inducing regularization terms, the overlapping Group Lasso penalty l1 /l2 -norm and the l1 /l∞ -norm. We propose a uniﬁed framework based on the augmented Lagrangian method, under which problems with both types of regularization and their variants can be efﬁciently solved. As one of the core building-blocks of this framework, we develop new algorithms using a partial-linearization/splitting technique and prove that the accelerated versions 1 of these algorithms require O( √ε ) iterations to obtain an ε-optimal solution. We compare the performance of these algorithms against that of the alternating direction augmented Lagrangian and FISTA methods on a collection of data sets and apply them to two real-world problems to compare the relative merits of the two norms.

<p>Author: Philipp Hennig, Christian J. Schuler</p><p>Abstract: Contemporary global optimization algorithms are based on local measures of utility, rather than a probability measure over location and value of the optimum. They thus attempt to collect low function values, not to learn about the optimum. The reason for the absence of probabilistic global optimizers is that the corresponding inference problem is intractable in several ways. This paper develops desiderata for probabilistic optimization algorithms, then presents a concrete algorithm which addresses each of the computational intractabilities with a sequence of approximations and explicitly addresses the decision problem of maximizing information gain from each evaluation.

<p>Author: Rahul Mazumder,  Trevor Hastie</p><p>Abstract: We consider the sparse inverse covariance regularization problem or graphical lasso with regularization parameter λ. Suppose the sample covariance graph formed by thresholding the entries of the sample covariance matrix at λ is decomposed into connected components. We show that the vertex-partition induced by the connected components of the thresholded sample covariance graph (at λ) is exactly equal to that induced by the connected components of the estimated concentration graph, obtained by solving the graphical lasso problem for the same λ. This characterizes a very interesting property of a path of graphical lasso solutions. Furthermore, this simple rule, when used as a wrapper around existing algorithms for the graphical lasso, leads to enormous performance gains. For a range of values of λ, our proposal splits a large graphical lasso problem into smaller tractable problems, making it possible to solve an otherwise infeasible large-scale problem. We illustrate the graceful scalability of our proposal via synthetic and real-life microarray examples.

<p>Author: Zhiwei Qin, Donald Goldfarb</p><p>Abstract: We consider a class of sparse learning problems in high dimensional feature space regularized by a structured sparsity-inducing norm that incorporates prior knowledge of the group structure of the features. Such problems often pose a considerable challenge to optimization algorithms due to the non-smoothness and non-separability of the regularization term. In this paper, we focus on two commonly adopted sparsity-inducing regularization terms, the overlapping Group Lasso penalty l1 /l2 -norm and the l1 /l∞ -norm. We propose a uniﬁed framework based on the augmented Lagrangian method, under which problems with both types of regularization and their variants can be efﬁciently solved. As one of the core building-blocks of this framework, we develop new algorithms using a partial-linearization/splitting technique and prove that the accelerated versions 1 of these algorithms require O( √ε ) iterations to obtain an ε-optimal solution. We compare the performance of these algorithms against that of the alternating direction augmented Lagrangian and FISTA methods on a collection of data sets and apply them to two real-world problems to compare the relative merits of the two norms.

<p>Author: Le Song, Alex Smola, Arthur Gretton, Justin Bedo, Karsten Borgwardt</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a framework for feature selection based on dependence maximization between the selected features and the labels of an estimation problem, using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. The key idea is that good features should be highly dependent on the labels. Our approach leads to a greedy procedure for feature selection. We show that a number of existing feature selectors are special cases of this framework. Experiments on both artiﬁcial and real-world data show that our feature selector works well in practice.

<p>Author: David P. Helmbold, Philip M. Long</p><p>Abstract: This work explores the effects of relevant and irrelevant boolean variables on the accuracy of classiﬁers. The analysis uses the assumption that the variables are conditionally independent given the class, and focuses on a natural family of learning algorithms for such sources when the relevant variables have a small advantage over random guessing. The main result is that algorithms relying predominately on irrelevant variables have error probabilities that quickly go to 0 in situations where algorithms that limit the use of irrelevant variables have errors bounded below by a positive constant. We also show that accurate learning is possible even when there are so few examples that one cannot determine with high conﬁdence whether or not any individual variable is relevant.

<p>Author: Andreas Maurer, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We present a data dependent generalization bound for a large class of regularized algorithms which implement structured sparsity constraints. The bound can be applied to standard squared-norm regularization, the Lasso, the group Lasso, some versions of the group Lasso with overlapping groups, multiple kernel learning and other regularization schemes. In all these cases competitive results are obtained. A novel feature of our bound is that it can be applied in an inﬁnite dimensional setting such as the Lasso in a separable Hilbert space or multiple kernel learning with a countable number of kernels.

<p>Author: Ioannis Tsamardinos, Sofia Triantafillou, Vincenzo Lagani</p><p>Abstract: We present methods able to predict the presence and strength of conditional and unconditional dependencies (correlations) between two variables Y and Z never jointly measured on the same samples, based on multiple data sets measuring a set of common variables. The algorithms are specializations of prior work on learning causal structures from overlapping variable sets. This problem has also been addressed in the ﬁeld of statistical matching. The proposed methods are applied to a wide range of domains and are shown to accurately predict the presence of thousands of dependencies. Compared against prototypical statistical matching algorithms and within the scope of our experiments, the proposed algorithms make predictions that are better correlated with the sample estimates of the unknown parameters on test data ; this is particularly the case when the number of commonly measured variables is low. The enabling idea behind the methods is to induce one or all causal models that are simultaneously consistent with (ﬁt) all available data sets and prior knowledge and reason with them. This allows constraints stemming from causal assumptions (e.g., Causal Markov Condition, Faithfulness) to propagate. Several methods have been developed based on this idea, for which we propose the unifying name Integrative Causal Analysis (INCA). A contrived example is presented demonstrating the theoretical potential to develop more general methods for co-analyzing heterogeneous data sets. The computational experiments with the novel methods provide evidence that causallyinspired assumptions such as Faithfulness often hold to a good degree of approximation in many real systems and could be exploited for statistical inference.

<p>Author: Jasper Snoek, Ryan P. Adams, Hugo Larochelle</p><p>Abstract: While unsupervised learning has long been useful for density modeling, exploratory data analysis and visualization, it has become increasingly important for discovering features that will later be used for discriminative tasks. Discriminative algorithms often work best with highly-informative features; remarkably, such features can often be learned without the labels. One particularly effective way to perform such unsupervised learning has been to use autoencoder neural networks, which ﬁnd latent representations that are constrained but nevertheless informative for reconstruction. However, pure unsupervised learning with autoencoders can ﬁnd representations that may or may not be useful for the ultimate discriminative task. It is a continuing challenge to guide the training of an autoencoder so that it ﬁnds features which will be useful for predicting labels. Similarly, we often have a priori information regarding what statistical variation will be irrelevant to the ultimate discriminative task, and we would like to be able to use this for guidance as well. Although a typical strategy would be to include a parametric discriminative model as part of the autoencoder training, here we propose a nonparametric approach that uses a Gaussian process to guide the representation. By using a nonparametric model, we can ensure that a useful discriminative function exists for a given set of features, without explicitly instantiating it. We demonstrate the superiority of this guidance mechanism on four data sets, including a real-world application to rehabilitation research. We also show how our proposed approach can learn to explicitly ignore statistically signiﬁcant covariate information that is label-irrelevant, by evaluating on the small NORB image recognition problem in which pose and lighting labels are available.

In contrast to other packages, our toolkit implements recent state-of-the-art algorithms as well as most classic algorithms.

<p>Author: Gavin Brown, Adam Pocock, Ming-Jie Zhao, Mikel Luján</p><p>Abstract: We present a unifying framework for information theoretic feature selection, bringing almost two decades of research on heuristic ﬁlter criteria under a single theoretical interpretation. This is in response to the question: “what are the implicit statistical assumptions of feature selection criteria based on mutual information?”. To answer this, we adopt a different strategy than is usual in the feature selection literature—instead of trying to deﬁne a criterion, we derive one, directly from a clearly speciﬁed objective function: the conditional likelihood of the training labels. While many hand-designed heuristic criteria try to optimize a deﬁnition of feature ‘relevancy’ and ‘redundancy’, our approach leads to a probabilistic framework which naturally incorporates these concepts. As a result we can unify the numerous criteria published over the last two decades, and show them to be low-order approximations to the exact (but intractable) optimisation problem. The primary contribution is to show that common heuristics for information based feature selection (including Markov Blanket algorithms as a special case) are approximate iterative maximisers of the conditional likelihood. A large empirical study provides strong evidence to favour certain classes of criteria, in particular those that balance the relative size of the relevancy/redundancy terms. Overall we conclude that the JMI criterion (Yang and Moody, 1999; Meyer et al., 2008) provides the best tradeoff in terms of accuracy, stability, and ﬂexibility with small data samples.

<p>Author: Trinh Minh Tri Do, Thierry Artières</p><p>Abstract: Machine learning is most often cast as an optimization problem. Ideally, one expects a convex objective function to rely on efﬁcient convex optimizers with nice guarantees such as no local optima. Yet, non-convexity is very frequent in practice and it may sometimes be inappropriate to look for convexity at any price. Alternatively one can decide not to limit a priori the modeling expressivity to models whose learning may be solved by convex optimization and rely on non-convex optimization algorithms. The main motivation of this work is to provide efﬁcient and scalable algorithms for non-convex optimization. We focus on regularized unconstrained optimization problems which cover a large number of modern machine learning problems such as logistic regression, conditional random ﬁelds, large margin estimation, etc. We propose a novel algorithm for minimizing a regularized objective that is able to handle convex and non-convex, smooth and non-smooth risks. The algorithm is based on the cutting plane technique and on the idea of exploiting the regularization term in the objective function. It may be thought as a limited memory extension of convex regularized bundle methods for dealing with convex and non convex risks. In case the risk is convex the algorithm is proved to converge to a stationary solution with accuracy ε with a rate O(1/λε) where λ is the regularization parameter of the objective function under the assumption of a Lipschitz empirical risk. In case the risk is not convex getting such a proof is more difﬁcult and requires a stronger and more disputable assumption. Yet we provide experimental results on artiﬁcial test problems, and on ﬁve standard and difﬁcult machine learning problems that are cast as convex and non-convex optimization problems that show how our algorithm compares well in practice with state of the art optimization algorithms.

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Mark Dredze, Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Conﬁdence-weighted online learning is a generalization of margin-based learning of linear classiﬁers in which the margin constraint is replaced by a probabilistic constraint based on a distribution over classiﬁer weights that is updated online as examples are observed. The distribution captures a notion of conﬁdence on classiﬁer weights, and in some cases it can also be interpreted as replacing a single learning rate by adaptive per-weight rates. Conﬁdence-weighted learning was motivated by the statistical properties of natural-language classiﬁcation tasks, where most of the informative features are relatively rare. We investigate several versions of conﬁdence-weighted learning that use a Gaussian distribution over weight vectors, updated at each observed example to achieve high probability of correct classiﬁcation for the example. Empirical evaluation on a range of textcategorization tasks show that our algorithms improve over other state-of-the-art online and batch methods, learn faster in the online setting, and lead to better classiﬁer combination for a type of distributed training commonly used in cloud computing.

<p>Author: Chunhua Shen, Junae Kim, Lei Wang, Anton van den Hengel</p><p>Abstract: The success of many machine learning and pattern recognition methods relies heavily upon the identiﬁcation of an appropriate distance metric on the input data. It is often beneﬁcial to learn such a metric from the input training data, instead of using a default one such as the Euclidean distance. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed B OOST M ETRIC, for learning a quadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the metric remains positive semideﬁnite. Semideﬁnite programming is often used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and is not easy to implement. B OOST M ETRIC is instead based on the observation that any positive semideﬁnite matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. B OOST M ETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semideﬁnite matrices as weak learners within an efﬁcient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting methods are easy to implement, efﬁcient, and can accommodate various types of constraints. We extend traditional boosting algorithms in that its weak learner is a positive semideﬁnite matrix with trace and rank being one rather than a classiﬁer or regressor. Experiments on various data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms compare favorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and running time.

<p>Author: Sunita Nayak, Kester Duncan, Sudeep Sarkar, Barbara Loeding</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework to automatically learn models of recurring signs from multiple sign language video sequences containing the vocabulary of interest. We extract the parts of the signs that are present in most occurrences of the sign in context and are robust to the variations produced by adjacent signs. Each sentence video is ﬁrst transformed into a multidimensional time series representation, capturing the motion and shape aspects of the sign. Skin color blobs are extracted from frames of color video sequences, and a probabilistic relational distribution is formed for each frame using the contour and edge pixels from the skin blobs. Each sentence is represented as a trajectory in a low dimensional space called the space of relational distributions. Given these time series trajectories, we extract signemes from multiple sentences concurrently using iterated conditional modes (ICM). We show results by learning single signs from a collection of sentences with one common pervading sign, multiple signs from a collection of sentences with more than one common sign, and single signs from a mixed collection of sentences. The extracted signemes demonstrate that our approach is robust to some extent to the variations produced within a sign due to different contexts. We also show results whereby these learned sign models are used for spotting signs in test sequences.

<p>Author: Stephen R. Piccolo, Lewis J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by a need to classify high-dimensional, heterogeneous data from the bioinformatics domain, we developed ML-Flex, a machine-learning toolbox that enables users to perform two-class and multi-class classiﬁcation analyses in a systematic yet ﬂexible manner. ML-Flex was written in Java but is capable of interfacing with third-party packages written in other programming languages. It can handle multiple input-data formats and supports a variety of customizations. MLFlex provides implementations of various validation strategies, which can be executed in parallel across multiple computing cores, processors, and nodes. Additionally, ML-Flex supports aggregating evidence across multiple algorithms and data sets via ensemble learning.

<p>Author: Gary B. Huang, Andrew Kae, Carl Doersch, Erik Learned-Miller</p><p>Abstract: We consider a model for which it is important, early in processing, to estimate some variables with high precision, but perhaps at relatively low recall. If some variables can be identiﬁed with near certainty, they can be conditioned upon, allowing further inference to be done efﬁciently. Speciﬁcally, we consider optical character recognition (OCR) systems that can be bootstrapped by identifying a subset of correctly translated document words with very high precision. This “clean set” is subsequently used as document-speciﬁc training data. While OCR systems produce conﬁdence measures for the identity of each letter or word, thresholding these values still produces a signiﬁcant number of errors. We introduce a novel technique for identifying a set of correct words with very high precision. Rather than estimating posterior probabilities, we bound the probability that any given word is incorrect using an approximate worst case analysis. We give empirical results on a data set of difﬁcult historical newspaper scans, demonstrating that our method for identifying correct words makes only two errors in 56 documents. Using document-speciﬁc character models generated from this data, we are able to reduce the error over properly segmented characters by 34.1% from an initial OCR system’s translation.1 Keywords: optical character recognition, probability bounding, document-speciﬁc modeling, computer vision 1.

<p>Author: Michael U. Gutmann, Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: We consider the task of estimating, from observed data, a probabilistic model that is parameterized by a ﬁnite number of parameters. In particular, we are considering the situation where the model probability density function is unnormalized. That is, the model is only speciﬁed up to the partition function. The partition function normalizes a model so that it integrates to one for any choice of the parameters. However, it is often impossible to obtain it in closed form. Gibbs distributions, Markov and multi-layer networks are examples of models where analytical normalization is often impossible. Maximum likelihood estimation can then not be used without resorting to numerical approximations which are often computationally expensive. We propose here a new objective function for the estimation of both normalized and unnormalized models. The basic idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artiﬁcially generated noise. With this approach, the normalizing partition function can be estimated like any other parameter. We prove that the new estimation method leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters. For large noise sample sizes, the new estimator is furthermore shown to behave like the maximum likelihood estimator. In the estimation of unnormalized models, there is a trade-off between statistical and computational performance. We show that the new method strikes a competitive trade-off in comparison to other estimation methods for unnormalized models. As an application to real data, we estimate novel two-layer models of natural image statistics with spline nonlinearities.

<p>Author: Stephen R. Piccolo, Lewis J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by a need to classify high-dimensional, heterogeneous data from the bioinformatics domain, we developed ML-Flex, a machine-learning toolbox that enables users to perform two-class and multi-class classiﬁcation analyses in a systematic yet ﬂexible manner. ML-Flex was written in Java but is capable of interfacing with third-party packages written in other programming languages. It can handle multiple input-data formats and supports a variety of customizations. MLFlex provides implementations of various validation strategies, which can be executed in parallel across multiple computing cores, processors, and nodes. Additionally, ML-Flex supports aggregating evidence across multiple algorithms and data sets via ensemble learning. This open-source software package is freely available from http://mlflex.sourceforge.net. Keywords: toolbox, classiﬁcation, parallel, ensemble, reproducible research</p><p>4 0.20448013 <a title="90-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2012-Learning_Algorithms_for_the_Classification_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine.html">55 jmlr-2012-Learning Algorithms for the Classification Restricted Boltzmann Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Hugo Larochelle, Michael Mandel, Razvan Pascanu, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Recent developments have demonstrated the capacity of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to be powerful generative models, able to extract useful features from input data or construct deep artiﬁcial neural networks. In such settings, the RBM only yields a preprocessing or an initialization for some other model, instead of acting as a complete supervised model in its own right. In this paper, we argue that RBMs can provide a self-contained framework for developing competitive classiﬁers. We study the Classiﬁcation RBM (ClassRBM), a variant on the RBM adapted to the classiﬁcation setting. We study different strategies for training the ClassRBM and show that competitive classiﬁcation performances can be reached when appropriately combining discriminative and generative training objectives. Since training according to the generative objective requires the computation of a generally intractable gradient, we also compare different approaches to estimating this gradient and address the issue of obtaining such a gradient for problems with very high dimensional inputs. Finally, we describe how to adapt the ClassRBM to two special cases of classiﬁcation problems, namely semi-supervised and multitask learning.

<p>Author: Michael Brückner, Christian Kanzow, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: The standard assumption of identically distributed training and test data is violated when the test data are generated in response to the presence of a predictive model. This becomes apparent, for example, in the context of email spam ﬁltering. Here, email service providers employ spam ﬁlters, and spam senders engineer campaign templates to achieve a high rate of successful deliveries despite the ﬁlters. We model the interaction between the learner and the data generator as a static game in which the cost functions of the learner and the data generator are not necessarily antagonistic. We identify conditions under which this prediction game has a unique Nash equilibrium and derive algorithms that ﬁnd the equilibrial prediction model. We derive two instances, the Nash logistic regression and the Nash support vector machine, and empirically explore their properties in a case study on email spam ﬁltering.

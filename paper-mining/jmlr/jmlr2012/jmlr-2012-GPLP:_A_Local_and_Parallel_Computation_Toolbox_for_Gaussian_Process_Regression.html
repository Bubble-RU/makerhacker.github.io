<p>Author: Odalric-Ambrym Maillard, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a method for regression that makes use of a randomly generated subspace GP ⊂ F (of ﬁnite dimension P) of a given large (possibly inﬁnite) dimensional function space F , for example, L2 ([0, 1]d ; R). GP is deﬁned as the span of P random features that are linear combinations of a basis functions of F weighted by random Gaussian i.i.d. coefﬁcients. We show practical motivation for the use of this approach, detail the link that this random projections method share with RKHS and Gaussian objects theory and prove, both in deterministic and random design, approximation error bounds when searching for the best regression function in GP rather than in F , and derive excess risk bounds for a speciﬁc regression algorithm (least squares regression in GP ). This paper stresses the motivation to study such methods, thus the analysis developed is kept simple for explanations purpose and leaves room for future developments.

<p>Author: Hannes Nickisch</p><p>Abstract: The glm-ie toolbox contains functionality for estimation and inference in generalised linear models over continuous-valued variables. Besides a variety of penalised least squares solvers for estimation, it offers inference based on (convex) variational bounds, on expectation propagation and on factorial mean ﬁeld. Scalable and efﬁcient inference in fully-connected undirected graphical models or Markov random ﬁelds with Gaussian and non-Gaussian potentials is achieved by casting all the computations as matrix vector multiplications. We provide a wide choice of penalty functions for estimation, potential functions for inference and matrix classes with lazy evaluation for convenient modelling. We designed the glm-ie package to be simple, generic and easily expansible. Most of the code is written in Matlab including some MEX ﬁles to be fully compatible to both Matlab 7.x and GNU Octave 3.3.x. Large scale probabilistic classiﬁcation as well as sparse linear modelling can be performed in a common algorithmical framework by the glm-ie toolkit.

<p>Author: Jasper Snoek, Ryan P. Adams, Hugo Larochelle</p><p>Abstract: While unsupervised learning has long been useful for density modeling, exploratory data analysis and visualization, it has become increasingly important for discovering features that will later be used for discriminative tasks. Discriminative algorithms often work best with highly-informative features; remarkably, such features can often be learned without the labels. One particularly effective way to perform such unsupervised learning has been to use autoencoder neural networks, which ﬁnd latent representations that are constrained but nevertheless informative for reconstruction. However, pure unsupervised learning with autoencoders can ﬁnd representations that may or may not be useful for the ultimate discriminative task. It is a continuing challenge to guide the training of an autoencoder so that it ﬁnds features which will be useful for predicting labels. Similarly, we often have a priori information regarding what statistical variation will be irrelevant to the ultimate discriminative task, and we would like to be able to use this for guidance as well. Although a typical strategy would be to include a parametric discriminative model as part of the autoencoder training, here we propose a nonparametric approach that uses a Gaussian process to guide the representation. By using a nonparametric model, we can ensure that a useful discriminative function exists for a given set of features, without explicitly instantiating it. We demonstrate the superiority of this guidance mechanism on four data sets, including a real-world application to rehabilitation research. We also show how our proposed approach can learn to explicitly ignore statistically signiﬁcant covariate information that is label-irrelevant, by evaluating on the small NORB image recognition problem in which pose and lighting labels are available.

<p>Author: Philipp Hennig, Christian J. Schuler</p><p>Abstract: Contemporary global optimization algorithms are based on local measures of utility, rather than a probability measure over location and value of the optimum. They thus attempt to collect low function values, not to learn about the optimum. The reason for the absence of probabilistic global optimizers is that the corresponding inference problem is intractable in several ways. This paper develops desiderata for probabilistic optimization algorithms, then presents a concrete algorithm which addresses each of the computational intractabilities with a sequence of approximations and explicitly addresses the decision problem of maximizing information gain from each evaluation.

<p>Author: Fei Yan, Josef Kittler, Krystian Mikolajczyk, Atif Tahir</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity-inducing multiple kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (MK-FDA) has been studied in the literature. Building on recent advances in non-sparse multiple kernel learning (MKL), we propose a non-sparse version of MK-FDA, which imposes a general ℓ p norm regularisation on the kernel weights. We formulate the associated optimisation problem as a semi-inﬁnite program (SIP), and adapt an iterative wrapper algorithm to solve it. We then discuss, in light of latest advances in MKL optimisation techniques, several reformulations and optimisation strategies that can potentially lead to signiﬁcant improvements in the efﬁciency and scalability of MK-FDA. We carry out extensive experiments on six datasets from various application areas, and compare closely the performance of ℓ p MK-FDA, ﬁxed norm MK-FDA, and several variants of SVM-based MKL (MK-SVM). Our results demonstrate that ℓ p MK-FDA improves upon sparse MK-FDA in many practical situations. The results also show that on image categorisation problems, ℓ p MK-FDA tends to outperform its SVM counterpart. Finally, we also discuss the connection between (MK-)FDA and (MK-)SVM, under the uniﬁed framework of regularised kernel machines.

<p>Author: George Konidaris, Ilya Scheidwasser, Andrew Barto</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for transfer in reinforcement learning based on the idea that related tasks share some common features, and that transfer can be achieved via those shared features. The framework attempts to capture the notion of tasks that are related but distinct, and provides some insight into when transfer can be usefully applied to a problem sequence and when it cannot. We apply the framework to the knowledge transfer problem, and show that an agent can learn a portable shaping function from experience in a sequence of tasks to signiﬁcantly improve performance in a later related task, even given a very brief training period. We also apply the framework to skill transfer, to show that agents can learn portable skills across a sequence of tasks that signiﬁcantly improve performance on later related tasks, approaching the performance of agents given perfectly learned problem-speciﬁc skills. Keywords: reinforcement learning, transfer, shaping, skills</p><p>4 0.2463363 <a title="47-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2012-Exploration_in_Relational_Domains_for_Model-based_Reinforcement_Learning.html">41 jmlr-2012-Exploration in Relational Domains for Model-based Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Tobias Lang, Marc Toussaint, Kristian Kersting</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental problem in reinforcement learning is balancing exploration and exploitation. We address this problem in the context of model-based reinforcement learning in large stochastic relational domains by developing relational extensions of the concepts of the E 3 and R- MAX algorithms. Efﬁcient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efﬁciency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efﬁcient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions. Our results in noisy 3D simulated robot manipulation problems and in domains of the international planning competition demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing propositional and factored exploration techniques.

<p>Author: Michael Brückner, Christian Kanzow, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: The standard assumption of identically distributed training and test data is violated when the test data are generated in response to the presence of a predictive model. This becomes apparent, for example, in the context of email spam ﬁltering. Here, email service providers employ spam ﬁlters, and spam senders engineer campaign templates to achieve a high rate of successful deliveries despite the ﬁlters. We model the interaction between the learner and the data generator as a static game in which the cost functions of the learner and the data generator are not necessarily antagonistic. We identify conditions under which this prediction game has a unique Nash equilibrium and derive algorithms that ﬁnd the equilibrial prediction model. We derive two instances, the Nash logistic regression and the Nash support vector machine, and empirically explore their properties in a case study on email spam ﬁltering.

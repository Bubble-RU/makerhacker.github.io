<p>Author: Petros Drineas, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Michael W. Mahoney, David P. Woodruff</p><p>Abstract: The statistical leverage scores of a matrix A are the squared row-norms of the matrix containing its (top) left singular vectors and the coherence is the largest leverage score. These quantities are of interest in recently-popular problems such as matrix completion and Nystr¨ m-based low-rank o matrix approximation as well as in large-scale statistical data analysis applications more generally; moreover, they are of interest since they deﬁne the key structural nonuniformity that must be dealt with in developing fast randomized matrix algorithms. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that takes as input an arbitrary n × d matrix A, with n ≫ d, and that returns as output relative-error approximations to all n of the statistical leverage scores. The proposed algorithm runs (under assumptions on the precise values of n and d) in O(nd log n) time, as opposed to the O(nd 2 ) time required by the na¨ve algorithm that involves computing an orthogonal basis for the ı range of A. Our analysis may be viewed in terms of computing a relative-error approximation to an underconstrained least-squares approximation problem, or, relatedly, it may be viewed as an application of Johnson-Lindenstrauss type ideas. Several practically-important extensions of our basic result are also described, including the approximation of so-called cross-leverage scores, the extension of these ideas to matrices with n ≈ d, and the extension to streaming environments.

<p>Author: Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents new and effective algorithms for learning kernels. In particular, as shown by our empirical results, these algorithms consistently outperform the so-called uniform combination solution that has proven to be difﬁcult to improve upon in the past, as well as other algorithms for learning kernels based on convex combinations of base kernels in both classiﬁcation and regression. Our algorithms are based on the notion of centered alignment which is used as a similarity measure between kernels or kernel matrices. We present a number of novel algorithmic, theoretical, and empirical results for learning kernels based on our notion of centered alignment. In particular, we describe efﬁcient algorithms for learning a maximum alignment kernel by showing that the problem can be reduced to a simple QP and discuss a one-stage algorithm for learning both a kernel and a hypothesis based on that kernel using an alignment-based regularization. Our theoretical results include a novel concentration bound for centered alignment between kernel matrices, the proof of the existence of effective predictors for kernels with high alignment, both for classiﬁcation and for regression, and the proof of stability-based generalization bounds for a broad family of algorithms for learning kernels based on centered alignment. We also report the results of experiments with our centered alignment-based algorithms in both classiﬁcation and regression.

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Dehua Liu, Guang Dai, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) naturally embody sparseness due to their use of hinge loss functions. However, SVMs can not directly estimate conditional class probabilities. In this paper we propose and study a family of coherence functions, which are convex and differentiable, as surrogates of the hinge function. The coherence function is derived by using the maximum-entropy principle and is characterized by a temperature parameter. It bridges the hinge function and the logit function in logistic regression. The limit of the coherence function at zero temperature corresponds to the hinge function, and the limit of the minimizer of its expected error is the minimizer of the expected error of the hinge loss. We refer to the use of the coherence function in large-margin classiﬁcation as “C -learning,” and we present efﬁcient coordinate descent algorithms for the training of regularized C -learning models.

<p>Author: James Bergstra, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efÄ?Ĺš cient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to conÄ?Ĺš gure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks conÄ?Ĺš gured by a pure grid search, we Ä?Ĺš nd that random search over the same domain is able to Ä?Ĺš nd models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search Ä?Ĺš nds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising conÄ?Ĺš guration space. Compared with deep belief networks conÄ?Ĺš gured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional conÄ?Ĺš guration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for conÄ?Ĺš guring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent Ă˘&euro;&oelig;High ThroughputĂ˘&euro;? methods achieve surprising successĂ˘&euro;&rdquo;they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.

<p>Author: Timo Aho, Bernard Ženko, Sašo Džeroski, Tapio Elomaa</p><p>Abstract: Methods for learning decision rules are being successfully applied to many problem domains, in particular when understanding and interpretation of the learned model is necessary. In many real life problems, we would like to predict multiple related (nominal or numeric) target attributes simultaneously. While several methods for learning rules that predict multiple targets at once exist, they are all based on the covering algorithm, which does not work well for regression problems. A better solution for regression is the rule ensemble approach that transcribes an ensemble of decision trees into a large collection of rules. An optimization procedure is then used to select the best (and much smaller) subset of these rules and to determine their respective weights. We introduce the F IRE algorithm for solving multi-target regression problems, which employs the rule ensembles approach. We improve the accuracy of the algorithm by adding simple linear functions to the ensemble. We also extensively evaluate the algorithm with and without linear functions. The results show that the accuracy of multi-target regression rule ensembles is high. They are more accurate than, for instance, multi-target regression trees, but not quite as accurate as multi-target random forests. The rule ensembles are signiﬁcantly more concise than random forests, and it is also possible to create compact rule sets that are smaller than a single regression tree but still comparable in accuracy.

<p>Author: Uri Shalit, Daphna Weinshall, Gal Chechik</p><p>Abstract: When learning models that are represented in matrix forms, enforcing a low-rank constraint can dramatically improve the memory and run time complexity, while providing a natural regularization of the model. However, naive approaches to minimizing functions over the set of low-rank matrices are either prohibitively time consuming (repeated singular value decomposition of the matrix) or numerically unstable (optimizing a factored representation of the low-rank matrix). We build on recent advances in optimization over manifolds, and describe an iterative online learning procedure, consisting of a gradient step, followed by a second-order retraction back to the manifold. While the ideal retraction is costly to compute, and so is the projection operator that approximates it, we describe another retraction that can be computed efﬁciently. It has run time and memory complexity of O ((n + m)k) for a rank-k matrix of dimension m × n, when using an online procedure with rank-one gradients. We use this algorithm, L ORETA, to learn a matrix-form similarity measure over pairs of documents represented as high dimensional vectors. L ORETA improves the mean average precision over a passive-aggressive approach in a factorized model, and also improves over a full model trained on pre-selected features using the same memory requirements. We further adapt L ORETA to learn positive semi-deﬁnite low-rank matrices, providing an online algorithm for low-rank metric learning. L ORETA also shows consistent improvement over standard weakly supervised methods in a large (1600 classes and 1 million images, using ImageNet) multi-label image classiﬁcation task.

<p>Author: Wojciech Rejchel</p><p>Abstract: The problem of ranking is to predict or to guess the ordering between objects on the basis of their observed features. In this paper we consider ranking estimators that minimize the empirical convex risk. We prove generalization bounds for the excess risk of such estimators with rates that are 1 faster than √n . We apply our results to commonly used ranking algorithms, for instance boosting or support vector machines. Moreover, we study the performance of considered estimators on real data sets.

<p>Author: Sanjiv Kumar, Mehryar Mohri, Ameet Talwalkar</p><p>Abstract: The Nystr¨ m method is an efﬁcient technique to generate low-rank matrix approximations and is o used in several large-scale learning applications. A key aspect of this method is the procedure according to which columns are sampled from the original matrix. In this work, we explore the efﬁcacy of a variety of ﬁxed and adaptive sampling schemes. We also propose a family of ensemble-based sampling algorithms for the Nystr¨ m method. We report results of extensive experiments o that provide a detailed comparison of various ﬁxed and adaptive sampling techniques, and demonstrate the performance improvement associated with the ensemble Nystr¨ m method when used in o conjunction with either ﬁxed or adaptive sampling schemes. Corroborating these empirical ﬁndings, we present a theoretical analysis of the Nystr¨ m method, providing novel error bounds guaro anteeing a better convergence rate of the ensemble Nystr¨ m method in comparison to the standard o Nystr¨ m method. o Keywords: low-rank approximation, nystr¨ m method, ensemble methods, large-scale learning o</p><p>3 0.35667127 <a title="103-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2012-On_the_Convergence_Rate_oflp-Norm_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">81 jmlr-2012-On the Convergence Rate oflp-Norm Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Gilles Blanchard</p><p>Abstract: We derive an upper bound on the local Rademacher complexity of ℓ p -norm multiple kernel learning, which yields a tighter excess risk bound than global approaches. Previous local approaches analyzed the case p = 1 only while our analysis covers all cases 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, assuming the different feature mappings corresponding to the different kernels to be uncorrelated. We also show a lower bound that shows that the bound is tight, and derive consequences regarding excess loss, namely α fast convergence rates of the order O(n− 1+α ), where α is the minimum eigenvalue decay rate of the individual kernels.

<p>Author: Tim van Erven, Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: Mixability of a loss characterizes fast rates in the online learning setting of prediction with expert advice. The determination of the mixability constant for binary losses is straightforward but opaque. In the binary case we make this transparent and simpler by characterising mixability in terms of the second derivative of the Bayes risk of proper losses. We then extend this result to multiclass proper losses where there are few existing results. We show that mixability is governed by the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the Bayes risk, relative to the Hessian of the Bayes risk for log loss. We conclude by comparing our result to other work that bounds prediction performance in terms of the geometry of the Bayes risk. Although all calculations are for proper losses, we also show how to carry the results across to improper losses.

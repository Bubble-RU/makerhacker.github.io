<p>Author: Blaine Nelson, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein, Ling Huang, Anthony D. Joseph, Steven J. Lee, Satish Rao, J. D. Tygar</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁers are often used to detect miscreant activities. We study how an adversary can systematically query a classiﬁer to elicit information that allows the attacker to evade detection while incurring a near-minimal cost of modifying their intended malfeasance. We generalize the theory of Lowd and Meek (2005) to the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers that partition their feature space into two sets, one of which is convex. We present query algorithms for this family that construct undetected instances of approximately minimal cost using only polynomially-many queries in the dimension of the space and in the level of approximation. Our results demonstrate that nearoptimal evasion can be accomplished for this family without reverse engineering the classiﬁer’s decision boundary. We also consider general ℓ p costs and show that near-optimal evasion on the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers is generally efﬁcient for both positive and negative convexity for all levels of approximation if p = 1.

<p>Author: Gil Tahan, Lior Rokach, Yuval Shahar</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes several novel methods, based on machine learning, to detect malware in executable ﬁles without any need for preprocessing, such as unpacking or disassembling. The basic method (Mal-ID) is a new static (form-based) analysis methodology that uses common segment analysis in order to detect malware ﬁles. By using common segment analysis, Mal-ID is able to discard malware parts that originate from benign code. In addition, Mal-ID uses a new kind of feature, termed meta-feature, to better capture the properties of the analyzed segments. Rather than using the entire ﬁle, as is usually the case with machine learning based techniques, the new approach detects malware on the segment level. This study also introduces two Mal-ID extensions that improve the Mal-ID basic method in various aspects. We rigorously evaluated Mal-ID and its two extensions with more than ten performance measures, and compared them to the highly rated boosted decision tree method under identical settings. The evaluation demonstrated that Mal-ID and the two Mal-ID extensions outperformed the boosted decision tree method in almost all respects. In addition, the results indicated that by extracting meaningful features, it is sufﬁcient to employ one simple detection rule for classifying executable ﬁles.

<p>Author: JooSeuk Kim, Clayton D. Scott</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for nonparametric density estimation that exhibits robustness to contamination of the training sample. This method achieves robustness by combining a traditional kernel density estimator (KDE) with ideas from classical M-estimation. We interpret the KDE based on a positive semi-deﬁnite kernel as a sample mean in the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Since the sample mean is sensitive to outliers, we estimate it robustly via M-estimation, yielding a robust kernel density estimator (RKDE). An RKDE can be computed efﬁciently via a kernelized iteratively re-weighted least squares (IRWLS) algorithm. Necessary and sufﬁcient conditions are given for kernelized IRWLS to converge to the global minimizer of the M-estimator objective function. The robustness of the RKDE is demonstrated with a representer theorem, the inﬂuence function, and experimental results for density estimation and anomaly detection.

<p>Author: Konstantin Voevodski, Maria-Florina Balcan, Heiko Röglin, Shang-Hua Teng, Yu Xia</p><p>Abstract: Given a point set S and an unknown metric d on S, we study the problem of efﬁciently partitioning S into k clusters while querying few distances between the points. In our model we assume that we have access to one versus all queries that given a point s ∈ S return the distances between s and all other points. We show that given a natural assumption about the structure of the instance, we can efﬁciently ﬁnd an accurate clustering using only O(k) distance queries. Our algorithm uses an active selection strategy to choose a small set of points that we call landmarks, and considers only the distances between landmarks and other points to produce a clustering. We use our procedure to cluster proteins by sequence similarity. This setting nicely ﬁts our model because we can use a fast sequence database search program to query a sequence against an entire data set. We conduct an empirical study that shows that even though we query a small fraction of the distances between the points, we produce clusterings that are close to a desired clustering given by manual classiﬁcation.

<p>Author: Konrad Rieck, Christian Wressnegger, Alexander Bikadorov</p><p>Abstract: Strings and sequences are ubiquitous in many areas of data analysis. However, only few learning methods can be directly applied to this form of data. We present Sally, a tool for embedding strings in vector spaces that allows for applying a wide range of learning methods to string data. Sally implements a generalized form of the bag-of-words model, where strings are mapped to a vector space that is spanned by a set of string features, such as words or n-grams of words. The implementation of Sally builds on efﬁcient string algorithms and enables processing millions of strings and features. The tool supports several data formats and is capable of interfacing with common learning environments, such as Weka, Shogun, Matlab, or Pylab. Sally has been successfully applied for learning with natural language text, DNA sequences and monitored program behavior.

<p>Author: Benjamin I.P. Rubinstein, J. Hyam Rubinstein</p><p>Abstract: The Sample Compression Conjecture of Littlestone & Warmuth has remained unsolved for a quarter century. While maximum classes (concept classes meeting Sauer’s Lemma with equality) can be compressed, the compression of general concept classes reduces to compressing maximal classes (classes that cannot be expanded without increasing VC dimension). Two promising ways forward are: embedding maximal classes into maximum classes with at most a polynomial increase to VC dimension, and compression via operating on geometric representations. This paper presents positive results on the latter approach and a ﬁrst negative result on the former, through a systematic investigation of ﬁnite maximum classes. Simple arrangements of hyperplanes in hyperbolic space are shown to represent maximum classes, generalizing the corresponding Euclidean result. We show that sweeping a generic hyperplane across such arrangements forms an unlabeled compression scheme of size VC dimension and corresponds to a special case of peeling the one-inclusion graph, resolving a recent conjecture of Kuzmin & Warmuth. A bijection between ﬁnite maximum classes and certain arrangements of piecewise-linear (PL) hyperplanes in either a ball or Euclidean space is established. Finally we show that d-maximum classes corresponding to PL-hyperplane arrangements in Rd have cubical complexes homeomorphic to a d-ball, or equivalently complexes that are manifolds with boundary. A main result is that PL arrangements can be swept by a moving hyperplane to unlabeled d-compress any ﬁnite maximum class, forming a peeling scheme as conjectured by Kuzmin & Warmuth. A corollary is that some d-maximal classes cannot be embedded into any maximum class of VC-dimension d + k, for any constant k. The construction of the PL sweeping involves Pachner moves on the one-inclusion graph, corresponding to moves of a hyperplane across the intersection of d other hyperplanes. This extends the well known Pachner moves for triangulations to c</p><p>5 0.25827947 <a title="104-lsi-5" href="./jmlr-2012-Hope_and_Fear_for_Discriminative_Training_of_Statistical_Translation_Models.html">49 jmlr-2012-Hope and Fear for Discriminative Training of Statistical Translation Models</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: In machine translation, discriminative models have almost entirely supplanted the classical noisychannel model, but are standardly trained using a method that is reliable only in low-dimensional spaces. Two strands of research have tried to adapt more scalable discriminative training methods to machine translation: the ﬁrst uses log-linear probability models and either maximum likelihood or minimum risk, and the other uses linear models and large-margin methods. Here, we provide an overview of the latter. We compare several learning algorithms and describe in detail some novel extensions suited to properties of the translation task: no single correct output, a large space of structured outputs, and slow inference. We present experimental results on a large-scale ArabicEnglish translation task, demonstrating large gains in translation accuracy.

<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Pavel Laskov</p><p>Abstract: Security issues are crucial in a number of machine learning applications, especially in scenarios dealing with human activity rather than natural phenomena (e.g., information ranking, spam detection, malware detection, etc.). In such cases, learning algorithms may have to cope with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some previous work addressed the issue of handling malicious data in the context of supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution,1 we analyze the performance of a particular method—online centroid anomaly detection—in the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes, derivation of an optimal attack, and analysis of attack efﬁciency and limitations. We derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid anomaly detection under different conditions: attacker’s full or limited control over the trafﬁc and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be made arbitrarily difﬁcult (a strict upper bound on the attacker’s gain) if external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation, carried out on real traces of HTTP and exploit trafﬁc, conﬁrms the tightness of our theoretical bounds and the practicality of our protection mechanisms.

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Dehua Liu, Guang Dai, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) naturally embody sparseness due to their use of hinge loss functions. However, SVMs can not directly estimate conditional class probabilities. In this paper we propose and study a family of coherence functions, which are convex and differentiable, as surrogates of the hinge function. The coherence function is derived by using the maximum-entropy principle and is characterized by a temperature parameter. It bridges the hinge function and the logit function in logistic regression. The limit of the coherence function at zero temperature corresponds to the hinge function, and the limit of the minimizer of its expected error is the minimizer of the expected error of the hinge loss. We refer to the use of the coherence function in large-margin classiﬁcation as “C -learning,” and we present efﬁcient coordinate descent algorithms for the training of regularized C -learning models.

<p>Author: Benedict C. May, Nathan Korda, Anthony Lee, David S. Leslie</p><p>Abstract: In sequential decision problems in an unknown environment, the decision maker often faces a dilemma over whether to explore to discover more about the environment, or to exploit current knowledge. We address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in a general setting encompassing both standard and contextualised bandit problems. The contextual bandit problem has recently resurfaced in attempts to maximise click-through rates in web based applications, a task with signiﬁcant commercial interest. In this article we consider an approach of Thompson (1933) which makes use of samples from the posterior distributions for the instantaneous value of each action. We extend the approach by introducing a new algorithm, Optimistic Bayesian Sampling (OBS), in which the probability of playing an action increases with the uncertainty in the estimate of the action value. This results in better directed exploratory behaviour. We prove that, under unrestrictive assumptions, both approaches result in optimal behaviour with respect to the average reward criterion of Yang and Zhu (2002). We implement OBS and measure its performance in simulated Bernoulli bandit and linear regression domains, and also when tested with the task of personalised news article recommendation on a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module data set. We ﬁnd that OBS performs competitively when compared to recently proposed benchmark algorithms and outperforms Thompson’s method throughout.

<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Amr Ahmed, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: A supervised topic model can use side information such as ratings or labels associated with documents or images to discover more predictive low dimensional topical representations of the data. However, existing supervised topic models predominantly employ likelihood-driven objective functions for learning and inference, leaving the popular and potentially powerful max-margin principle unexploited for seeking predictive representations of data and more discriminative topic bases for the corpus. In this paper, we propose the maximum entropy discrimination latent Dirichlet allocation (MedLDA) model, which integrates the mechanism behind the max-margin prediction models (e.g., SVMs) with the mechanism behind the hierarchical Bayesian topic models (e.g., LDA) under a uniﬁed constrained optimization framework, and yields latent topical representations that are more discriminative and more suitable for prediction tasks such as document classiﬁcation or regression. The principle underlying the MedLDA formalism is quite general and can be applied for jointly max-margin and maximum likelihood learning of directed or undirected topic models when supervising side information is available. Efﬁcient variational methods for posterior inference and parameter estimation are derived and extensive empirical studies on several real data sets are also provided. Our experimental results demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that MedLDA could: 1) discover sparse and highly discriminative topical representations; 2) achieve state of the art prediction performance; and 3) be more efﬁcient than existing supervised topic models, especially for classiﬁcation.

<p>Author: Uri Shalit, Daphna Weinshall, Gal Chechik</p><p>Abstract: When learning models that are represented in matrix forms, enforcing a low-rank constraint can dramatically improve the memory and run time complexity, while providing a natural regularization of the model. However, naive approaches to minimizing functions over the set of low-rank matrices are either prohibitively time consuming (repeated singular value decomposition of the matrix) or numerically unstable (optimizing a factored representation of the low-rank matrix). We build on recent advances in optimization over manifolds, and describe an iterative online learning procedure, consisting of a gradient step, followed by a second-order retraction back to the manifold. While the ideal retraction is costly to compute, and so is the projection operator that approximates it, we describe another retraction that can be computed efﬁciently. It has run time and memory complexity of O ((n + m)k) for a rank-k matrix of dimension m × n, when using an online procedure with rank-one gradients. We use this algorithm, L ORETA, to learn a matrix-form similarity measure over pairs of documents represented as high dimensional vectors. L ORETA improves the mean average precision over a passive-aggressive approach in a factorized model, and also improves over a full model trained on pre-selected features using the same memory requirements. We further adapt L ORETA to learn positive semi-deﬁnite low-rank matrices, providing an online algorithm for low-rank metric learning. L ORETA also shows consistent improvement over standard weakly supervised methods in a large (1600 classes and 1 million images, using ImageNet) multi-label image classiﬁcation task.

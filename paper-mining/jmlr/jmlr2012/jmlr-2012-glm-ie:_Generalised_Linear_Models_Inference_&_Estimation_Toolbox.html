<p>Author: Kay H. Brodersen, Christoph Mathys, Justin R. Chumbley, Jean Daunizeau, Cheng Soon Ong, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaas E. Stephan</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁcation algorithms are frequently used on data with a natural hierarchical structure. For instance, classiﬁers are often trained and tested on trial-wise measurements, separately for each subject within a group. One important question is how classiﬁcation outcomes observed in individual subjects can be generalized to the population from which the group was sampled. To address this question, this paper introduces novel statistical models that are guided by three desiderata. First, all models explicitly respect the hierarchical nature of the data, that is, they are mixed-effects models that simultaneously account for within-subjects (ﬁxed-effects) and across-subjects (random-effects) variance components. Second, maximum-likelihood estimation is replaced by full Bayesian inference in order to enable natural regularization of the estimation problem and to afford conclusions in terms of posterior probability statements. Third, inference on classiﬁcation accuracy is complemented by inference on the balanced accuracy, which avoids inﬂated accuracy estimates for imbalanced data sets. We introduce hierarchical models that satisfy these criteria and demonstrate their advantages over conventional methods using MCMC implementations for model inversion and model selection on both synthetic and empirical data. We envisage that our approach will improve the sensitivity and validity of statistical inference in future hierarchical classiﬁcation studies.

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Shusen Wang, Dehua Liu, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel framework for the construction of sparsity-inducing priors. In particular, we deﬁne such priors as a mixture of exponential power distributions with a generalized inverse Gaussian density (EP-GIG). EP-GIG is a variant of generalized hyperbolic distributions, and the special cases include Gaussian scale mixtures and Laplace scale mixtures. Furthermore, Laplace scale mixtures can subserve a Bayesian framework for sparse learning with nonconvex penalization. The densities of EP-GIG can be explicitly expressed. Moreover, the corresponding posterior distribution also follows a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. We exploit these properties to develop EM algorithms for sparse empirical Bayesian learning. We also show that these algorithms bear an interesting resemblance to iteratively reweighted ℓ2 or ℓ1 methods. Finally, we present two extensions for grouped variable selection and logistic regression.

<p>Author: Jian Huang, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The ℓ1 -penalized method, or the Lasso, has emerged as an important tool for the analysis of large data sets. Many important results have been obtained for the Lasso in linear regression which have led to a deeper understanding of high-dimensional statistical problems. In this article, we consider a class of weighted ℓ1 -penalized estimators for convex loss functions of a general form, including the generalized linear models. We study the estimation, prediction, selection and sparsity properties of the weighted ℓ1 -penalized estimator in sparse, high-dimensional settings where the number of predictors p can be much larger than the sample size n. Adaptive Lasso is considered as a special case. A multistage method is developed to approximate concave regularized estimation by applying an adaptive Lasso recursively. We provide prediction and estimation oracle inequalities for single- and multi-stage estimators, a general selection consistency theorem, and an upper bound for the dimension of the Lasso estimator. Important models including the linear regression, logistic regression and log-linear models are used throughout to illustrate the applications of the general results.

<p>Author: Antti Hyttinen, Frederick Eberhardt, Patrik O. Hoyer</p><p>Abstract: Identifying cause-effect relationships between variables of interest is a central problem in science. Given a set of experiments we describe a procedure that identiﬁes linear models that may contain cycles and latent variables. We provide a detailed description of the model family, full proofs of the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for identiﬁability, a search algorithm that is complete, and a discussion of what can be done when the identiﬁability conditions are not satisﬁed. The algorithm is comprehensively tested in simulations, comparing it to competing algorithms in the literature. Furthermore, we adapt the procedure to the problem of cellular network inference, applying it to the biologically realistic data of the DREAM challenges. The paper provides a full theoretical foundation for the causal discovery procedure ﬁrst presented by Eberhardt et al. (2010) and Hyttinen et al. (2010).

<p>Author: Jia Zeng</p><p>Abstract: Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is an important hierarchical Bayesian model for probabilistic topic modeling, which attracts worldwide interests and touches on many important applications in text mining, computer vision and computational biology. This paper introduces a topic modeling toolbox (TMBP) based on the belief propagation (BP) algorithms. TMBP toolbox is implemented by MEX C++/Matlab/Octave for either Windows 7 or Linux. Compared with existing topic modeling packages, the novelty of this toolbox lies in the BP algorithms for learning LDA-based topic models. The current version includes BP algorithms for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), authortopic models (ATM), relational topic models (RTM), and labeled LDA (LaLDA). This toolbox is an ongoing project and more BP-based algorithms for various topic models will be added in the near future. Interested users may also extend BP algorithms for learning more complicated topic models.

Large scale probabilistic classiﬁcation as well as sparse linear modelling can be performed in a common algorithmical framework by the glm-ie toolkit.

<p>Author: Tobias Lang, Marc Toussaint, Kristian Kersting</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental problem in reinforcement learning is balancing exploration and exploitation. We address this problem in the context of model-based reinforcement learning in large stochastic relational domains by developing relational extensions of the concepts of the E 3 and R- MAX algorithms. Efﬁcient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efﬁciency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efﬁcient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions. Our results in noisy 3D simulated robot manipulation problems and in domains of the international planning competition demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing propositional and factored exploration techniques.

<p>Author: Fei Yan, Josef Kittler, Krystian Mikolajczyk, Atif Tahir</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity-inducing multiple kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (MK-FDA) has been studied in the literature. Building on recent advances in non-sparse multiple kernel learning (MKL), we propose a non-sparse version of MK-FDA, which imposes a general ℓ p norm regularisation on the kernel weights. We formulate the associated optimisation problem as a semi-inﬁnite program (SIP), and adapt an iterative wrapper algorithm to solve it. We then discuss, in light of latest advances in MKL optimisation techniques, several reformulations and optimisation strategies that can potentially lead to signiﬁcant improvements in the efﬁciency and scalability of MK-FDA. We carry out extensive experiments on six datasets from various application areas, and compare closely the performance of ℓ p MK-FDA, ﬁxed norm MK-FDA, and several variants of SVM-based MKL (MK-SVM). Our results demonstrate that ℓ p MK-FDA improves upon sparse MK-FDA in many practical situations. The results also show that on image categorisation problems, ℓ p MK-FDA tends to outperform its SVM counterpart. Finally, we also discuss the connection between (MK-)FDA and (MK-)SVM, under the uniﬁed framework of regularised kernel machines.

<p>Author: George Konidaris, Ilya Scheidwasser, Andrew Barto</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for transfer in reinforcement learning based on the idea that related tasks share some common features, and that transfer can be achieved via those shared features. The framework attempts to capture the notion of tasks that are related but distinct, and provides some insight into when transfer can be usefully applied to a problem sequence and when it cannot. We apply the framework to the knowledge transfer problem, and show that an agent can learn a portable shaping function from experience in a sequence of tasks to signiﬁcantly improve performance in a later related task, even given a very brief training period. We also apply the framework to skill transfer, to show that agents can learn portable skills across a sequence of tasks that signiﬁcantly improve performance on later related tasks, approaching the performance of agents given perfectly learned problem-speciﬁc skills.

<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Gilles Blanchard</p><p>Abstract: We derive an upper bound on the local Rademacher complexity of ℓ p -norm multiple kernel learning, which yields a tighter excess risk bound than global approaches. Previous local approaches analyzed the case p = 1 only while our analysis covers all cases 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, assuming the different feature mappings corresponding to the different kernels to be uncorrelated. We also show a lower bound that shows that the bound is tight, and derive consequences regarding excess loss, namely α fast convergence rates of the order O(n− 1+α ), where α is the minimum eigenvalue decay rate of the individual kernels.

<p>Author: Sahand Negahban, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the matrix completion problem under a form of row/column weighted entrywise sampling, including the case of uniform entrywise sampling as a special case. We analyze the associated random observation operator, and prove that with high probability, it satisﬁes a form of restricted strong convexity with respect to weighted Frobenius norm. Using this property, we obtain as corollaries a number of error bounds on matrix completion in the weighted Frobenius norm under noisy sampling and for both exact and near low-rank matrices. Our results are based on measures of the “spikiness” and “low-rankness” of matrices that are less restrictive than the incoherence conditions imposed in previous work. Our technique involves an M-estimator that includes controls on both the rank and spikiness of the solution, and we establish non-asymptotic error bounds in weighted Frobenius norm for recovering matrices lying with ℓq -“balls” of bounded spikiness. Using information-theoretic methods, we show that no algorithm can achieve better estimates (up to a logarithmic factor) over these same sets, showing that our conditions on matrices and associated rates are essentially optimal.

<p>Author: Petros Drineas, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Michael W. Mahoney, David P. Woodruff</p><p>Abstract: The statistical leverage scores of a matrix A are the squared row-norms of the matrix containing its (top) left singular vectors and the coherence is the largest leverage score. These quantities are of interest in recently-popular problems such as matrix completion and Nystr¨ m-based low-rank o matrix approximation as well as in large-scale statistical data analysis applications more generally; moreover, they are of interest since they deﬁne the key structural nonuniformity that must be dealt with in developing fast randomized matrix algorithms. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that takes as input an arbitrary n × d matrix A, with n ≫ d, and that returns as output relative-error approximations to all n of the statistical leverage scores. The proposed algorithm runs (under assumptions on the precise values of n and d) in O(nd log n) time, as opposed to the O(nd 2 ) time required by the na¨ve algorithm that involves computing an orthogonal basis for the ı range of A. Our analysis may be viewed in terms of computing a relative-error approximation to an underconstrained least-squares approximation problem, or, relatedly, it may be viewed as an application of Johnson-Lindenstrauss type ideas. Several practically-important extensions of our basic result are also described, including the approximation of so-called cross-leverage scores, the extension of these ideas to matrices with n ≈ d, and the extension to streaming environments.

<p>Author: Matthieu Solnon, Sylvain Arlot, Francis Bach</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we study the kernel multiple ridge regression framework, which we refer to as multitask regression, using penalization techniques. The theoretical analysis of this problem shows that the key element appearing for an optimal calibration is the covariance matrix of the noise between the different tasks. We present a new algorithm to estimate this covariance matrix, based on the concept of minimal penalty, which was previously used in the single-task regression framework to estimate the variance of the noise. We show, in a non-asymptotic setting and under mild assumptions on the target function, that this estimator converges towards the covariance matrix. Then plugging this estimator into the corresponding ideal penalty leads to an oracle inequality. We illustrate the behavior of our algorithm on synthetic examples.

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Shusen Wang, Dehua Liu, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel framework for the construction of sparsity-inducing priors. In particular, we deﬁne such priors as a mixture of exponential power distributions with a generalized inverse Gaussian density (EP-GIG). EP-GIG is a variant of generalized hyperbolic distributions, and the special cases include Gaussian scale mixtures and Laplace scale mixtures. Furthermore, Laplace scale mixtures can subserve a Bayesian framework for sparse learning with nonconvex penalization. The densities of EP-GIG can be explicitly expressed. Moreover, the corresponding posterior distribution also follows a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. We exploit these properties to develop EM algorithms for sparse empirical Bayesian learning. We also show that these algorithms bear an interesting resemblance to iteratively reweighted ℓ2 or ℓ1 methods. Finally, we present two extensions for grouped variable selection and logistic regression.

<p>Author: Uri Shalit, Daphna Weinshall, Gal Chechik</p><p>Abstract: When learning models that are represented in matrix forms, enforcing a low-rank constraint can dramatically improve the memory and run time complexity, while providing a natural regularization of the model. However, naive approaches to minimizing functions over the set of low-rank matrices are either prohibitively time consuming (repeated singular value decomposition of the matrix) or numerically unstable (optimizing a factored representation of the low-rank matrix). We build on recent advances in optimization over manifolds, and describe an iterative online learning procedure, consisting of a gradient step, followed by a second-order retraction back to the manifold. While the ideal retraction is costly to compute, and so is the projection operator that approximates it, we describe another retraction that can be computed efﬁciently. It has run time and memory complexity of O ((n + m)k) for a rank-k matrix of dimension m × n, when using an online procedure with rank-one gradients. We use this algorithm, L ORETA, to learn a matrix-form similarity measure over pairs of documents represented as high dimensional vectors. L ORETA improves the mean average precision over a passive-aggressive approach in a factorized model, and also improves over a full model trained on pre-selected features using the same memory requirements. We further adapt L ORETA to learn positive semi-deﬁnite low-rank matrices, providing an online algorithm for low-rank metric learning. L ORETA also shows consistent improvement over standard weakly supervised methods in a large (1600 classes and 1 million images, using ImageNet) multi-label image classiﬁcation task.

<p>Author: Karthik Mohan, Maryam Fazel</p><p>Abstract: The problem of minimizing the rank of a matrix subject to afﬁne constraints has applications in several areas including machine learning, and is known to be NP-hard. A tractable relaxation for this problem is nuclear norm (or trace norm) minimization, which is guaranteed to ﬁnd the minimum rank matrix under suitable assumptions. In this paper, we propose a family of Iterative Reweighted Least Squares algorithms IRLS-p (with 0 ≤ p ≤ 1), as a computationally efﬁcient way to improve over the performance of nuclear norm minimization. The algorithms can be viewed as (locally) minimizing certain smooth approximations to the rank function. When p = 1, we give theoretical guarantees similar to those for nuclear norm minimization, that is, recovery of low-rank matrices under certain assumptions on the operator deﬁning the constraints. For p < 1, IRLSp shows better empirical performance in terms of recovering low-rank matrices than nuclear norm minimization. We provide an efﬁcient implementation for IRLS-p, and also present a related family of algorithms, sIRLS-p. These algorithms exhibit competitive run times and improved recovery when compared to existing algorithms for random instances of the matrix completion problem, as well as on the MovieLens movie recommendation data set.

<p>Author: Sahand Negahban, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the matrix completion problem under a form of row/column weighted entrywise sampling, including the case of uniform entrywise sampling as a special case. We analyze the associated random observation operator, and prove that with high probability, it satisﬁes a form of restricted strong convexity with respect to weighted Frobenius norm. Using this property, we obtain as corollaries a number of error bounds on matrix completion in the weighted Frobenius norm under noisy sampling and for both exact and near low-rank matrices. Our results are based on measures of the “spikiness” and “low-rankness” of matrices that are less restrictive than the incoherence conditions imposed in previous work. Our technique involves an M-estimator that includes controls on both the rank and spikiness of the solution, and we establish non-asymptotic error bounds in weighted Frobenius norm for recovering matrices lying with ℓq -“balls” of bounded spikiness. Using information-theoretic methods, we show that no algorithm can achieve better estimates (up to a logarithmic factor) over these same sets, showing that our conditions on matrices and associated rates are essentially optimal.

<p>Author: Christopher R. Genovese, Jiashun Jin, Larry Wasserman, Zhigang Yao</p><p>Abstract: The lasso is an important method for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems, with efﬁcient algorithms available, a long history of practical success, and a large body of theoretical results supporting and explaining its performance. But even with the best available algorithms, ﬁnding the lasso solutions remains a computationally challenging task in cases where the number of covariates vastly exceeds the number of data points. Marginal regression, where each dependent variable is regressed separately on each covariate, offers a promising alternative in this case because the estimates can be computed roughly two orders faster than the lasso solutions. The question that remains is how the statistical performance of the method compares to that of the lasso in these cases. In this paper, we study the relative statistical performance of the lasso and marginal regression for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems. We consider the problem of learning which coefﬁcients are non-zero. Our main results are as follows: (i) we compare the conditions under which the lasso and marginal regression guarantee exact recovery in the ﬁxed design, noise free case; (ii) we establish conditions under which marginal regression provides exact recovery with high probability in the ﬁxed design, noise free, random coefﬁcients case; and (iii) we derive rates of convergence for both procedures, where performance is measured by the number of coefﬁcients with incorrect sign, and characterize the regions in the parameter space recovery is and is not possible under this metric. In light of the computational advantages of marginal regression in very high dimensional problems, our theoretical and simulations results suggest that the procedure merits further study.

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Shusen Wang, Dehua Liu, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel framework for the construction of sparsity-inducing priors. In particular, we deﬁne such priors as a mixture of exponential power distributions with a generalized inverse Gaussian density (EP-GIG). EP-GIG is a variant of generalized hyperbolic distributions, and the special cases include Gaussian scale mixtures and Laplace scale mixtures. Furthermore, Laplace scale mixtures can subserve a Bayesian framework for sparse learning with nonconvex penalization. The densities of EP-GIG can be explicitly expressed. Moreover, the corresponding posterior distribution also follows a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. We exploit these properties to develop EM algorithms for sparse empirical Bayesian learning. We also show that these algorithms bear an interesting resemblance to iteratively reweighted ℓ2 or ℓ1 methods. Finally, we present two extensions for grouped variable selection and logistic regression.

<p>Author: Yongdai Kim, Sunghoon Kwon, Hosik Choi</p><p>Abstract: Asymptotic properties of model selection criteria for high-dimensional regression models are studied where the dimension of covariates is much larger than the sample size. Several sufﬁcient conditions for model selection consistency are provided. Non-Gaussian error distributions are considered and it is shown that the maximal number of covariates for model selection consistency depends on the tail behavior of the error distribution. Also, sufﬁcient conditions for model selection consistency are given when the variance of the noise is neither known nor estimated consistently. Results of simulation studies as well as real data analysis are given to illustrate that ﬁnite sample performances of consistent model selection criteria can be quite different.

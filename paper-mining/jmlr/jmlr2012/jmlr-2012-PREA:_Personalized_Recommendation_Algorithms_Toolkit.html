<p>Author: Stephen R. Piccolo, Lewis J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by a need to classify high-dimensional, heterogeneous data from the bioinformatics domain, we developed ML-Flex, a machine-learning toolbox that enables users to perform two-class and multi-class classiﬁcation analyses in a systematic yet ﬂexible manner. ML-Flex was written in Java but is capable of interfacing with third-party packages written in other programming languages. It can handle multiple input-data formats and supports a variety of customizations. MLFlex provides implementations of various validation strategies, which can be executed in parallel across multiple computing cores, processors, and nodes. Additionally, ML-Flex supports aggregating evidence across multiple algorithms and data sets via ensemble learning.

<p>Author: Nicolas Gillis</p><p>Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a very popular technique in machine learning because it automatically extracts meaningful features through a sparse and part-based representation. However, NMF has the drawback of being highly ill-posed, that is, there typically exist many different but equivalent factorizations. In this paper, we introduce a completely new way to obtaining more well-posed NMF problems whose solutions are sparser. Our technique is based on the preprocessing of the nonnegative input data matrix, and relies on the theory of M-matrices and the geometric interpretation of NMF. This approach provably leads to optimal and sparse solutions under the separability assumption of Donoho and Stodden (2003), and, for rank-three matrices, makes the number of exact factorizations ﬁnite. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique on several image data sets.

<p>Author: Gavin Brown, Adam Pocock, Ming-Jie Zhao, Mikel Luján</p><p>Abstract: We present a unifying framework for information theoretic feature selection, bringing almost two decades of research on heuristic ﬁlter criteria under a single theoretical interpretation. This is in response to the question: “what are the implicit statistical assumptions of feature selection criteria based on mutual information?”. To answer this, we adopt a different strategy than is usual in the feature selection literature—instead of trying to deﬁne a criterion, we derive one, directly from a clearly speciﬁed objective function: the conditional likelihood of the training labels. While many hand-designed heuristic criteria try to optimize a deﬁnition of feature ‘relevancy’ and ‘redundancy’, our approach leads to a probabilistic framework which naturally incorporates these concepts. As a result we can unify the numerous criteria published over the last two decades, and show them to be low-order approximations to the exact (but intractable) optimisation problem. The primary contribution is to show that common heuristics for information based feature selection (including Markov Blanket algorithms as a special case) are approximate iterative maximisers of the conditional likelihood. A large empirical study provides strong evidence to favour certain classes of criteria, in particular those that balance the relative size of the relevancy/redundancy terms. Overall we conclude that the JMI criterion (Yang and Moody, 1999; Meyer et al., 2008) provides the best tradeoff in terms of accuracy, stability, and ﬂexibility with small data samples.

<p>Author: Trinh Minh Tri Do, Thierry Artières</p><p>Abstract: Machine learning is most often cast as an optimization problem. Ideally, one expects a convex objective function to rely on efﬁcient convex optimizers with nice guarantees such as no local optima. Yet, non-convexity is very frequent in practice and it may sometimes be inappropriate to look for convexity at any price. Alternatively one can decide not to limit a priori the modeling expressivity to models whose learning may be solved by convex optimization and rely on non-convex optimization algorithms. The main motivation of this work is to provide efﬁcient and scalable algorithms for non-convex optimization. We focus on regularized unconstrained optimization problems which cover a large number of modern machine learning problems such as logistic regression, conditional random ﬁelds, large margin estimation, etc. We propose a novel algorithm for minimizing a regularized objective that is able to handle convex and non-convex, smooth and non-smooth risks. The algorithm is based on the cutting plane technique and on the idea of exploiting the regularization term in the objective function. It may be thought as a limited memory extension of convex regularized bundle methods for dealing with convex and non convex risks. In case the risk is convex the algorithm is proved to converge to a stationary solution with accuracy ε with a rate O(1/λε) where λ is the regularization parameter of the objective function under the assumption of a Lipschitz empirical risk. In case the risk is not convex getting such a proof is more difﬁcult and requires a stronger and more disputable assumption. Yet we provide experimental results on artiﬁcial test problems, and on ﬁve standard and difﬁcult machine learning problems that are cast as convex and non-convex optimization problems that show how our algorithm compares well in practice with state of the art optimization algorithms.

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Mark Dredze, Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Conﬁdence-weighted online learning is a generalization of margin-based learning of linear classiﬁers in which the margin constraint is replaced by a probabilistic constraint based on a distribution over classiﬁer weights that is updated online as examples are observed. The distribution captures a notion of conﬁdence on classiﬁer weights, and in some cases it can also be interpreted as replacing a single learning rate by adaptive per-weight rates. Conﬁdence-weighted learning was motivated by the statistical properties of natural-language classiﬁcation tasks, where most of the informative features are relatively rare. We investigate several versions of conﬁdence-weighted learning that use a Gaussian distribution over weight vectors, updated at each observed example to achieve high probability of correct classiﬁcation for the example. Empirical evaluation on a range of textcategorization tasks show that our algorithms improve over other state-of-the-art online and batch methods, learn faster in the online setting, and lead to better classiﬁer combination for a type of distributed training commonly used in cloud computing. Keywords: online learning, conﬁdence prediction, text categorization</p><p>5 0.95625329 <a title="88-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2012-Positive_Semidefinite_Metric_Learning_Using_Boosting-like_Algorithms.html">92 jmlr-2012-Positive Semidefinite Metric Learning Using Boosting-like Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunhua Shen, Junae Kim, Lei Wang, Anton van den Hengel</p><p>Abstract: The success of many machine learning and pattern recognition methods relies heavily upon the identiﬁcation of an appropriate distance metric on the input data. It is often beneﬁcial to learn such a metric from the input training data, instead of using a default one such as the Euclidean distance. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed B OOST M ETRIC, for learning a quadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the metric remains positive semideﬁnite. Semideﬁnite programming is often used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and is not easy to implement. B OOST M ETRIC is instead based on the observation that any positive semideﬁnite matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. B OOST M ETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semideﬁnite matrices as weak learners within an efﬁcient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting methods are easy to implement, efﬁcient, and can accommodate various types of constraints. We extend traditional boosting algorithms in that its weak learner is a positive semideﬁnite matrix with trace and rank being one rather than a classiﬁer or regressor. Experiments on various data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms compare favorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and running time.

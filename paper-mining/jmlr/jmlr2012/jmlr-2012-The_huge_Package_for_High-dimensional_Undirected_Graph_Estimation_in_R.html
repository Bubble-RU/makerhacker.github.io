This package implements recent results in the literature, including Friedman et al. (2007), Liu et al. (2009, 2012) and Liu et al. (2010). Compared with the existing graph estimation package glasso, the huge package provides extra features: (1) instead of using Fortan, it is written in C, which makes the code more portable and easier to modify; (2) besides ﬁtting Gaussian graphical models, it also provides functions for ﬁtting high dimensional semiparametric Gaussian copula models; (3) more functions like data-dependent model selection, data generation and graph visualization; (4) a minor convergence problem of the graphical lasso algorithm is corrected; (5) the package allows the user to apply both lossless and lossy screening rules to scale up large-scale problems, making a tradeoff between computational and statistical efﬁciency.

Overview Undirected graphs is a natural approach to describe the conditional independence among many variables. Each node of the graph represents a single variable and no edge between two variables implies that they are conditional independent given all other variables. In the past decade, significant progress has been made on designing efﬁcient algorithms to learn undirected graphs from high-dimensional observational data sets. Most of these methods are based on either the penalized maximum-likelihood estimation (Friedman et al., 2007) or penalized regression methods (Meinshausen and B¨ hlmann, 2006). Existing packages include glasso, Covpath and CLIME. In particuu ∗. Also in the Department of Biostatistics. †.

Z HAO , L IU , ROEDER , L AFFERTY AND WASSERMAN lar, the glasso package has been widely adopted by statisticians and computer scientists due to its friendly user-inference and efﬁciency. In this paper1 we describe a newly developed R package named huge (High-dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation) coded in C. The package includes a wide range of functional modules and addresses some drawbacks of the graphical lasso algorithm. To gain more scalability, the package supports two modes of screening, lossless (Witten et al., 2011) and lossy screening. When using lossy screening, the user can select the desired screening level to scale up for high-dimensional problems, but this introduces some estimation bias. 2. Software Design and Implementation The package huge aims to provide a general framework for high-dimensional undirected graph estimation. The package includes Six functional modules (M1-M6) facilitate a ﬂexible pipeline for analysis (Figure 1). M1. Data Generator: The function huge.generator() can simulate multivariate Gaussian data with different undirected graphs, including hub, cluster, band, scale-free, and Erd¨ s-R´ nyi o e random graphs. The sparsity level of the obtained graph and signal-to-noise ratio can also be set up by users. M2. Semiparametric Transformation: The function huge.npn() implements the nonparanormal method (Liu et al., 2009, 2012) for estimating a semiparametric Gaussian copula model.The nonparanormal family extends the Gaussian distribution by marginally transforming the variables. Computationally, the nonparanormal transformation only requires one pass through the data matrix. M3. Graph Screening: The scr argument in the main function huge() controls the use of largescale correlation screening before graph estimation. The function supports the lossless screening (Witten et al., 2011) and the lossy screening. Such screening procedures can greatly reduce the computational cost and achieve equal or even better estimation by reducing the variance at the expense of increased bias.

Graph Estimation: Similar to the glasso package, the method argument in the huge() function supports two estimation methods: (i) the neighborhood pursuit algorithm (Meinshausen and B¨ hlmann, 2006) and (ii) the graphical lasso algorithm (Friedman et al., 2007). We apply u the coordinate descent with active set and covariance update, as well as other tricks suggested in Friedman et al. (2010). We modiﬁed the warm start trick to address the potential divergence problem of the graphical lasso algorithm (Mazumder and Hastie, 2011).

<p>Author: Rahul Mazumder,  Trevor Hastie</p><p>Abstract: We consider the sparse inverse covariance regularization problem or graphical lasso with regularization parameter λ. Suppose the sample covariance graph formed by thresholding the entries of the sample covariance matrix at λ is decomposed into connected components. We show that the vertex-partition induced by the connected components of the thresholded sample covariance graph (at λ) is exactly equal to that induced by the connected components of the estimated concentration graph, obtained by solving the graphical lasso problem for the same λ. This characterizes a very interesting property of a path of graphical lasso solutions. Furthermore, this simple rule, when used as a wrapper around existing algorithms for the graphical lasso, leads to enormous performance gains. For a range of values of λ, our proposal splits a large graphical lasso problem into smaller tractable problems, making it possible to solve an otherwise infeasible large-scale problem. We illustrate the graceful scalability of our proposal via synthetic and real-life microarray examples.

We identify a set of graphs for which an efﬁcient estimation algorithm exists, and this algorithm is based on thresholding of empirical conditional covariances. Under a set of transparent conditions, we establish structural consistency (or sparsistency) for the proposed algorithm, when the number of −2 samples n = Ω(Jmin log p), where p is the number of variables and Jmin is the minimum (absolute) edge potential of the graphical model. The sufﬁcient conditions for sparsistency are based on the notion of walk-summability of the model and the presence of sparse local vertex separators in the underlying graph. We also derive novel non-asymptotic necessary conditions on the number of samples required for sparsistency.

<p>Author: Jian Huang, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The ℓ1 -penalized method, or the Lasso, has emerged as an important tool for the analysis of large data sets. Many important results have been obtained for the Lasso in linear regression which have led to a deeper understanding of high-dimensional statistical problems. In this article, we consider a class of weighted ℓ1 -penalized estimators for convex loss functions of a general form, including the generalized linear models. We study the estimation, prediction, selection and sparsity properties of the weighted ℓ1 -penalized estimator in sparse, high-dimensional settings where the number of predictors p can be much larger than the sample size n. Adaptive Lasso is considered as a special case. A multistage method is developed to approximate concave regularized estimation by applying an adaptive Lasso recursively. We provide prediction and estimation oracle inequalities for single- and multi-stage estimators, a general selection consistency theorem, and an upper bound for the dimension of the Lasso estimator. Important models including the linear regression, logistic regression and log-linear models are used throughout to illustrate the applications of the general results.

<p>Author: Christopher R. Genovese, Jiashun Jin, Larry Wasserman, Zhigang Yao</p><p>Abstract: The lasso is an important method for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems, with efﬁcient algorithms available, a long history of practical success, and a large body of theoretical results supporting and explaining its performance. But even with the best available algorithms, ﬁnding the lasso solutions remains a computationally challenging task in cases where the number of covariates vastly exceeds the number of data points. Marginal regression, where each dependent variable is regressed separately on each covariate, offers a promising alternative in this case because the estimates can be computed roughly two orders faster than the lasso solutions. The question that remains is how the statistical performance of the method compares to that of the lasso in these cases. In this paper, we study the relative statistical performance of the lasso and marginal regression for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems. We consider the problem of learning which coefﬁcients are non-zero. Our main results are as follows: (i) we compare the conditions under which the lasso and marginal regression guarantee exact recovery in the ﬁxed design, noise free case; (ii) we establish conditions under which marginal regression provides exact recovery with high probability in the ﬁxed design, noise free, random coefﬁcients case; and (iii) we derive rates of convergence for both procedures, where performance is measured by the number of coefﬁcients with incorrect sign, and characterize the regions in the parameter space recovery is and is not possible under this metric. In light of the computational advantages of marginal regression in very high dimensional problems, our theoretical and simulations results suggest that the procedure merits further study.

<p>Author: Tuo Zhao, Han Liu, Kathryn Roeder, John Lafferty, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: We describe an R package named huge which provides easy-to-use functions for estimating high dimensional undirected graphs from data. This package implements recent results in the literature, including Friedman et al. (2007), Liu et al. (2009, 2012) and Liu et al. (2010). Compared with the existing graph estimation package glasso, the huge package provides extra features: (1) instead of using Fortan, it is written in C, which makes the code more portable and easier to modify; (2) besides ﬁtting Gaussian graphical models, it also provides functions for ﬁtting high dimensional semiparametric Gaussian copula models; (3) more functions like data-dependent model selection, data generation and graph visualization; (4) a minor convergence problem of the graphical lasso algorithm is corrected; (5) the package allows the user to apply both lossless and lossy screening rules to scale up large-scale problems, making a tradeoff between computational and statistical efﬁciency. Keywords: high-dimensional undirected graph estimation, glasso, huge, semiparametric graph estimation, data-dependent model selection, lossless screening, lossy screening 1. Overview Undirected graphs is a natural approach to describe the conditional independence among many variables. Each node of the graph represents a single variable and no edge between two variables implies that they are conditional independent given all other variables. In the past decade, significant progress has been made on designing efﬁcient algorithms to learn undirected graphs from high-dimensional observational data sets. Most of these methods are based on either the penalized maximum-likelihood estimation (Friedman et al., 2007) or penalized regression methods (Meinshausen and B¨ hlmann, 2006). Existing packages include glasso, Covpath and CLIME. In particuu ∗. Also in the Department of Biostatistics. †. Also in the Department of Machine Learning. c 2012 Zhao, Liu, Roeder, Lafferty and Wasserman. Z HAO , L IU , ROEDER , L AFFERTY AND WASSERMAN lar, the glasso package has been widely adopted by statisticians and computer scientists due to its friendly user-inference and efﬁciency. In this paper1 we describe a newly developed R package named huge (High-dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation) coded in C. The package includes a wide range of functional modules and addresses some drawbacks of the graphical lasso algorithm. To gain more scalability, the package supports two modes of screening, lossless (Witten et al., 2011) and lossy screening. When using lossy screening, the user can select the desired screening level to scale up for high-dimensional problems, but this introduces some estimation bias. 2. Software Design and Implementation The package huge aims to provide a general framework for high-dimensional undirected graph estimation. The package includes Six functional modules (M1-M6) facilitate a ﬂexible pipeline for analysis (Figure 1). M1. Data Generator: The function huge.generator() can simulate multivariate Gaussian data with different undirected graphs, including hub, cluster, band, scale-free, and Erd¨ s-R´ nyi o e random graphs. The sparsity level of the obtained graph and signal-to-noise ratio can also be set up by users. M2. Semiparametric Transformation: The function huge.npn() implements the nonparanormal method (Liu et al., 2009, 2012) for estimating a semiparametric Gaussian copula model.The nonparanormal family extends the Gaussian distribution by marginally transforming the variables. Computationally, the nonparanormal transformation only requires one pass through the data matrix. M3. Graph Screening: The scr argument in the main function huge() controls the use of largescale correlation screening before graph estimation. The function supports the lossless screening (Witten et al., 2011) and the lossy screening. Such screening procedures can greatly reduce the computational cost and achieve equal or even better estimation by reducing the variance at the expense of increased bias. Figure 1: The graph estimation pipeline. M4. Graph Estimation: Similar to the glasso package, the method argument in the huge() function supports two estimation methods: (i) the neighborhood pursuit algorithm (Meinshausen and B¨ hlmann, 2006) and (ii) the graphical lasso algorithm (Friedman et al., 2007). We apply u the coordinate descent with active set and covariance update, as well as other tricks suggested in Friedman et al. (2010). We modiﬁed the warm start trick to address the potential divergence problem of the graphical lasso algorithm (Mazumder and Hastie, 2011). The code is also memory-optimized using the sparse matrix data structure when estimating and storing full regularization paths for large 1. This paper is only a summary of the package huge. For more details please refer to the online vignette. 1060 H IGH - DIMENSIONAL U NDIRECTED G RAPH E STIMATION data sets. we also provide a complementary graph estimation method based on thresholding the sample correlation matrix, which is computationally efﬁcient and widely applied in biomedical research. M5. Model Selection: The function huge.select() provides two regularization parameter selection methods: the stability approach for regularization selection (StARS) (Liu et al., 2010); and rotation information criterion (RIC). We also provide a likelihood-based extended Bayesian information criterion. M6. Graph Visualization: The plotting functions huge.plot() and plot() provide visualizations of the simulated data sets, estimated graphs and paths. The implementation is based on the igraph package. 3. User Interface by Example We illustrate the user interface by analyzing a stock market data which we contribute to the huge package. We acquired closing prices from all stocks in the S&P; 500 for all the days that the market was open between Jan 1, 2003 and Jan 1, 2008. This gave us 1258 samples for the 452 stocks that remained in the S&P; 500 during the entire time period. > > > > > library(huge) data(stockdata) # Load the data x = log(stockdata$data[2:1258,]/stockdata$data[1:1257,]) # Preprocessing x.npn = huge.npn(x, npn.func=</p><p>2 0.88474327 <a title="113-lsi-2" href="./jmlr-2012-Exact_Covariance_Thresholding_into_Connected_Components_for_Large-Scale_Graphical_Lasso.html">40 jmlr-2012-Exact Covariance Thresholding into Connected Components for Large-Scale Graphical Lasso</a></p>
<p>Author: Rahul Mazumder,  Trevor Hastie</p><p>Abstract: We consider the sparse inverse covariance regularization problem or graphical lasso with regularization parameter λ. Suppose the sample covariance graph formed by thresholding the entries of the sample covariance matrix at λ is decomposed into connected components. We show that the vertex-partition induced by the connected components of the thresholded sample covariance graph (at λ) is exactly equal to that induced by the connected components of the estimated concentration graph, obtained by solving the graphical lasso problem for the same λ. This characterizes a very interesting property of a path of graphical lasso solutions. Furthermore, this simple rule, when used as a wrapper around existing algorithms for the graphical lasso, leads to enormous performance gains. For a range of values of λ, our proposal splits a large graphical lasso problem into smaller tractable problems, making it possible to solve an otherwise infeasible large-scale problem. We illustrate the graceful scalability of our proposal via synthetic and real-life microarray examples.

Each node of the graph represents a single variable and no edge between two variables implies that they are conditional independent given all other variables. In the past decade, significant progress has been made on designing efﬁcient algorithms to learn undirected graphs from high-dimensional observational data sets. Most of these methods are based on either the penalized maximum-likelihood estimation (Friedman et al., 2007) or penalized regression methods (Meinshausen and B¨ hlmann, 2006). Existing packages include glasso, Covpath and CLIME. In particuu ∗. Also in the Department of Biostatistics. †.

Z HAO , L IU , ROEDER , L AFFERTY AND WASSERMAN lar, the glasso package has been widely adopted by statisticians and computer scientists due to its friendly user-inference and efﬁciency. In this paper1 we describe a newly developed R package named huge (High-dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation) coded in C. The package includes a wide range of functional modules and addresses some drawbacks of the graphical lasso algorithm. To gain more scalability, the package supports two modes of screening, lossless (Witten et al., 2011) and lossy screening. When using lossy screening, the user can select the desired screening level to scale up for high-dimensional problems, but this introduces some estimation bias. 2. Software Design and Implementation The package huge aims to provide a general framework for high-dimensional undirected graph estimation. The package includes Six functional modules (M1-M6) facilitate a ﬂexible pipeline for analysis (Figure 1). M1. Data Generator: The function huge.generator() can simulate multivariate Gaussian data with different undirected graphs, including hub, cluster, band, scale-free, and Erd¨ s-R´ nyi o e random graphs. The sparsity level of the obtained graph and signal-to-noise ratio can also be set up by users. M2. Semiparametric Transformation: The function huge.npn() implements the nonparanormal method (Liu et al., 2009, 2012) for estimating a semiparametric Gaussian copula model.The nonparanormal family extends the Gaussian distribution by marginally transforming the variables. Computationally, the nonparanormal transformation only requires one pass through the data matrix. M3. Graph Screening: The scr argument in the main function huge() controls the use of largescale correlation screening before graph estimation. The function supports the lossless screening (Witten et al., 2011) and the lossy screening. Such screening procedures can greatly reduce the computational cost and achieve equal or even better estimation by reducing the variance at the expense of increased bias.

Graph Estimation: Similar to the glasso package, the method argument in the huge() function supports two estimation methods: (i) the neighborhood pursuit algorithm (Meinshausen and B¨ hlmann, 2006) and (ii) the graphical lasso algorithm (Friedman et al., 2007). We apply u the coordinate descent with active set and covariance update, as well as other tricks suggested in Friedman et al. (2010). We modiﬁed the warm start trick to address the potential divergence problem of the graphical lasso algorithm (Mazumder and Hastie, 2011). The code is also memory-optimized using the sparse matrix data structure when estimating and storing full regularization paths for large 1. This paper is only a summary of the package huge.

M5. Model Selection: The function huge.select() provides two regularization parameter selection methods: the stability approach for regularization selection (StARS) (Liu et al., 2010); and rotation information criterion (RIC). We also provide a likelihood-based extended Bayesian information criterion. M6. Graph Visualization: The plotting functions huge.plot() and plot() provide visualizations of the simulated data sets, estimated graphs and paths. The implementation is based on the igraph package. 3. User Interface by Example We illustrate the user interface by analyzing a stock market data which we contribute to the huge package. We acquired closing prices from all stocks in the S&P; 500 for all the days that the market was open between Jan 1, 2003 and Jan 1, 2008. This gave us 1258 samples for the 452 stocks that remained in the S&P; 500 during the entire time period. > > > > > library(huge) data(stockdata) # Load the data x = log(stockdata$data[2:1258,]/stockdata$data[1:1257,]) # Preprocessing x.npn = huge.npn(x, npn.func=</p><p>2 0.81066316 <a title="113-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2012-Exploration_in_Relational_Domains_for_Model-based_Reinforcement_Learning.html">41 jmlr-2012-Exploration in Relational Domains for Model-based Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Tobias Lang, Marc Toussaint, Kristian Kersting</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental problem in reinforcement learning is balancing exploration and exploitation. We address this problem in the context of model-based reinforcement learning in large stochastic relational domains by developing relational extensions of the concepts of the E 3 and R- MAX algorithms. Efﬁcient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efﬁciency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efﬁcient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions. Our results in noisy 3D simulated robot manipulation problems and in domains of the international planning competition demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing propositional and factored exploration techniques.

<p>Author: Mario Frank, Andreas P. Streich, David Basin, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic model for clustering Boolean data where an object can be simultaneously assigned to multiple clusters. By explicitly modeling the underlying generative process that combines the individual source emissions, highly structured data are expressed with substantially fewer clusters compared to single-assignment clustering. As a consequence, such a model provides robust parameter estimators even when the number of samples is low. We extend the model with different noise processes and demonstrate that maximum-likelihood estimation with multiple assignments consistently infers source parameters more accurately than single-assignment clustering. Our model is primarily motivated by the task of role mining for role-based access control, where users of a system are assigned one or more roles. In experiments with real-world access-control data, our model exhibits better generalization performance than state-of-the-art approaches.

<p>Author: Timo Aho, Bernard Ženko, Sašo Džeroski, Tapio Elomaa</p><p>Abstract: Methods for learning decision rules are being successfully applied to many problem domains, in particular when understanding and interpretation of the learned model is necessary. In many real life problems, we would like to predict multiple related (nominal or numeric) target attributes simultaneously. While several methods for learning rules that predict multiple targets at once exist, they are all based on the covering algorithm, which does not work well for regression problems. A better solution for regression is the rule ensemble approach that transcribes an ensemble of decision trees into a large collection of rules. An optimization procedure is then used to select the best (and much smaller) subset of these rules and to determine their respective weights. We introduce the F IRE algorithm for solving multi-target regression problems, which employs the rule ensembles approach. We improve the accuracy of the algorithm by adding simple linear functions to the ensemble. We also extensively evaluate the algorithm with and without linear functions. The results show that the accuracy of multi-target regression rule ensembles is high. They are more accurate than, for instance, multi-target regression trees, but not quite as accurate as multi-target random forests. The rule ensembles are signiﬁcantly more concise than random forests, and it is also possible to create compact rule sets that are smaller than a single regression tree but still comparable in accuracy.

<p>Author: George Konidaris, Ilya Scheidwasser, Andrew Barto</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for transfer in reinforcement learning based on the idea that related tasks share some common features, and that transfer can be achieved via those shared features. The framework attempts to capture the notion of tasks that are related but distinct, and provides some insight into when transfer can be usefully applied to a problem sequence and when it cannot. We apply the framework to the knowledge transfer problem, and show that an agent can learn a portable shaping function from experience in a sequence of tasks to signiﬁcantly improve performance in a later related task, even given a very brief training period. We also apply the framework to skill transfer, to show that agents can learn portable skills across a sequence of tasks that signiﬁcantly improve performance on later related tasks, approaching the performance of agents given perfectly learned problem-speciﬁc skills.

<p>Author: Aharon Ben-Tal, Sahely Bhadra, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Arkadi Nemirovski</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we study the problem of designing SVM classiﬁers when the kernel matrix, K, is affected by uncertainty. Speciﬁcally K is modeled as a positive afﬁne combination of given positive semi deﬁnite kernels, with the coefﬁcients ranging in a norm-bounded uncertainty set. We treat the problem using the Robust Optimization methodology. This reduces the uncertain SVM problem into a deterministic conic quadratic problem which can be solved in principle by a polynomial time Interior Point (IP) algorithm. However, for large-scale classiﬁcation problems, IP methods become intractable and one has to resort to ﬁrst-order gradient type methods. The strategy we use here is to reformulate the robust counterpart of the uncertain SVM problem as a saddle point problem and employ a special gradient scheme which works directly on the convex-concave saddle function. The algorithm is a simpliﬁed version of a general scheme due to Juditski and Nemirovski (2011). It achieves an O(1/T 2 ) reduction of the initial error after T iterations. A comprehensive empirical study on both synthetic data and real-world protein structure data sets show that the proposed formulations achieve the desired robustness, and the saddle point based algorithm outperforms the IP method signiﬁcantly.

<p>Author: Fei Yan, Josef Kittler, Krystian Mikolajczyk, Atif Tahir</p><p>Abstract: Sparsity-inducing multiple kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (MK-FDA) has been studied in the literature. Building on recent advances in non-sparse multiple kernel learning (MKL), we propose a non-sparse version of MK-FDA, which imposes a general ℓ p norm regularisation on the kernel weights. We formulate the associated optimisation problem as a semi-inﬁnite program (SIP), and adapt an iterative wrapper algorithm to solve it. We then discuss, in light of latest advances in MKL optimisation techniques, several reformulations and optimisation strategies that can potentially lead to signiﬁcant improvements in the efﬁciency and scalability of MK-FDA. We carry out extensive experiments on six datasets from various application areas, and compare closely the performance of ℓ p MK-FDA, ﬁxed norm MK-FDA, and several variants of SVM-based MKL (MK-SVM). Our results demonstrate that ℓ p MK-FDA improves upon sparse MK-FDA in many practical situations. The results also show that on image categorisation problems, ℓ p MK-FDA tends to outperform its SVM counterpart. Finally, we also discuss the connection between (MK-)FDA and (MK-)SVM, under the uniﬁed framework of regularised kernel machines.

<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Brian Kulis, Jason V. Davis, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: Metric and kernel learning arise in several machine learning applications. However, most existing metric learning algorithms are limited to learning metrics over low-dimensional data, while existing kernel learning algorithms are often limited to the transductive setting and do not generalize to new data points. In this paper, we study the connections between metric learning and kernel learning that arise when studying metric learning as a linear transformation learning problem. In particular, we propose a general optimization framework for learning metrics via linear transformations, and analyze in detail a special case of our framework—that of minimizing the LogDet divergence subject to linear constraints. We then propose a general regularized framework for learning a kernel matrix, and show it to be equivalent to our metric learning framework. Our theoretical connections between metric and kernel learning have two main consequences: 1) the learned kernel matrix parameterizes a linear transformation kernel function and can be applied inductively to new data points, 2) our result yields a constructive method for kernelizing most existing Mahalanobis metric learning formulations. We demonstrate our learning approach by applying it to large-scale real world problems in computer vision, text mining and semi-supervised kernel dimensionality reduction.

<p>Author: Dominik Schnitzer, Arthur Flexer, Markus Schedl, Gerhard Widmer</p><p>Abstract: ‘Hubness’ has recently been identiﬁed as a general problem of high dimensional data spaces, manifesting itself in the emergence of objects, so-called hubs, which tend to be among the k nearest neighbors of a large number of data items. As a consequence many nearest neighbor relations in the distance space are asymmetric, that is, object y is amongst the nearest neighbors of x but not vice versa. The work presented here discusses two classes of methods that try to symmetrize nearest neighbor relations and investigates to what extent they can mitigate the negative effects of hubs. We evaluate local distance scaling and propose a global variant which has the advantage of being easy to approximate for large data sets and of having a probabilistic interpretation. Both local and global approaches are shown to be effective especially for high-dimensional data sets, which are affected by high hubness. Both methods lead to a strong decrease of hubness in these data sets, while at the same time improving properties like classiﬁcation accuracy. We evaluate the methods on a large number of public machine learning data sets and synthetic data. Finally we present a real-world application where we are able to achieve signiﬁcantly higher retrieval quality.

<p>Author: JooSeuk Kim, Clayton D. Scott</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for nonparametric density estimation that exhibits robustness to contamination of the training sample. This method achieves robustness by combining a traditional kernel density estimator (KDE) with ideas from classical M-estimation. We interpret the KDE based on a positive semi-deﬁnite kernel as a sample mean in the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Since the sample mean is sensitive to outliers, we estimate it robustly via M-estimation, yielding a robust kernel density estimator (RKDE). An RKDE can be computed efﬁciently via a kernelized iteratively re-weighted least squares (IRWLS) algorithm. Necessary and sufﬁcient conditions are given for kernelized IRWLS to converge to the global minimizer of the M-estimator objective function. The robustness of the RKDE is demonstrated with a representer theorem, the inﬂuence function, and experimental results for density estimation and anomaly detection.

<p>Author: Helen Cooper, Eng-Jon Ong, Nicolas Pugeault, Richard Bowden</p><p>Abstract: This paper discusses sign language recognition using linguistic sub-units. It presents three types of sub-units for consideration; those learnt from appearance data as well as those inferred from both 2D or 3D tracking data. These sub-units are then combined using a sign level classiﬁer; here, two options are presented. The ﬁrst uses Markov Models to encode the temporal changes between sub-units. The second makes use of Sequential Pattern Boosting to apply discriminative feature selection at the same time as encoding temporal information. This approach is more robust to noise and performs well in signer independent tests, improving results from the 54% achieved by the Markov Chains to 76%.

<p>Author: Sunita Nayak, Kester Duncan, Sudeep Sarkar, Barbara Loeding</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework to automatically learn models of recurring signs from multiple sign language video sequences containing the vocabulary of interest. We extract the parts of the signs that are present in most occurrences of the sign in context and are robust to the variations produced by adjacent signs. Each sentence video is ﬁrst transformed into a multidimensional time series representation, capturing the motion and shape aspects of the sign. Skin color blobs are extracted from frames of color video sequences, and a probabilistic relational distribution is formed for each frame using the contour and edge pixels from the skin blobs. Each sentence is represented as a trajectory in a low dimensional space called the space of relational distributions. Given these time series trajectories, we extract signemes from multiple sentences concurrently using iterated conditional modes (ICM). We show results by learning single signs from a collection of sentences with one common pervading sign, multiple signs from a collection of sentences with more than one common sign, and single signs from a mixed collection of sentences. The extracted signemes demonstrate that our approach is robust to some extent to the variations produced within a sign due to different contexts. We also show results whereby these learned sign models are used for spotting signs in test sequences.

<p>Author: Yui Man Lui</p><p>Abstract: Action videos are multidimensional data and can be naturally represented as data tensors. While tensor computing is widely used in computer vision, the geometry of tensor space is often ignored. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the intrinsic geometry of tensor space which yields a very discriminating structure for action recognition. We characterize data tensors as points on a product manifold and model it statistically using least squares regression. To this aim, we factorize a data tensor relating to each order of the tensor using Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) and then impose each factorized element on a Grassmann manifold. Furthermore, we account for underlying geometry on manifolds and formulate least squares regression as a composite function. This gives a natural extension from Euclidean space to manifolds. Consequently, classiﬁcation is performed using geodesic distance on a product manifold where each factor manifold is Grassmannian. Our method exploits appearance and motion without explicitly modeling the shapes and dynamics. We assess the proposed method using three gesture databases, namely the Cambridge hand-gesture, the UMD Keck body-gesture, and the CHALEARN gesture challenge data sets. Experimental results reveal that not only does the proposed method perform well on the standard benchmark data sets, but also it generalizes well on the one-shot-learning gesture challenge. Furthermore, it is based on a simple statistical model and the intrinsic geometry of tensor space.

<p>Author: Haizhang Zhang, Yuesheng Xu, Qinghui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the construction of a reﬁnement kernel for a given operator-valued reproducing kernel such that the vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the reﬁnement kernel contains that of the given kernel as a subspace. The study is motivated from the need of updating the current operator-valued reproducing kernel in multi-task learning when underﬁtting or overﬁtting occurs. Numerical simulations conﬁrm that the established reﬁnement kernel method is able to meet this need. Various characterizations are provided based on feature maps and vector-valued integral representations of operator-valued reproducing kernels. Concrete examples of reﬁning translation invariant and ﬁnite Hilbert-Schmidt operator-valued reproducing kernels are provided. Other examples include reﬁnement of Hessian of scalar-valued translation-invariant kernels and transformation kernels. Existence and properties of operator-valued reproducing kernels preserved during the reﬁnement process are also investigated.

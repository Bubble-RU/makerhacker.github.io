<h1>5 jmlr-2012-A Local Spectral Method for Graphs: With Applications to Improving Graph Partitions and Exploring Data Graphs Locally</h1>

To do so, we ﬁrst view the second eigenvector as the solution to a constrained optimization problem, and we incorporate the local information as an additional constraint; we then characterize the optimal solution to this new problem and show that it can be interpreted as a generalization of a Personalized PageRank vector; and ﬁnally, as a consequence, we show that the solution can be computed in nearly-linear time. In addition, we show that this locally-biased vector can be used to compute an approximation to the best partition near an input seed set in a manner analogous to the way in which the second eigenvector of the Laplacian can be used to obtain an approximation to the best partition in the entire input graph.

<p>Author: Trinh Minh Tri Do, Thierry Artières</p><p>Abstract: Machine learning is most often cast as an optimization problem. Ideally, one expects a convex objective function to rely on efﬁcient convex optimizers with nice guarantees such as no local optima. Yet, non-convexity is very frequent in practice and it may sometimes be inappropriate to look for convexity at any price. Alternatively one can decide not to limit a priori the modeling expressivity to models whose learning may be solved by convex optimization and rely on non-convex optimization algorithms. The main motivation of this work is to provide efﬁcient and scalable algorithms for non-convex optimization. We focus on regularized unconstrained optimization problems which cover a large number of modern machine learning problems such as logistic regression, conditional random ﬁelds, large margin estimation, etc. We propose a novel algorithm for minimizing a regularized objective that is able to handle convex and non-convex, smooth and non-smooth risks. The algorithm is based on the cutting plane technique and on the idea of exploiting the regularization term in the objective function. It may be thought as a limited memory extension of convex regularized bundle methods for dealing with convex and non convex risks. In case the risk is convex the algorithm is proved to converge to a stationary solution with accuracy ε with a rate O(1/λε) where λ is the regularization parameter of the objective function under the assumption of a Lipschitz empirical risk. In case the risk is not convex getting such a proof is more difﬁcult and requires a stronger and more disputable assumption. Yet we provide experimental results on artiﬁcial test problems, and on ﬁve standard and difﬁcult machine learning problems that are cast as convex and non-convex optimization problems that show how our algorithm compares well in practice with state of the art optimization algorithms.

<p>Author: Tim van Erven, Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: Mixability of a loss characterizes fast rates in the online learning setting of prediction with expert advice. The determination of the mixability constant for binary losses is straightforward but opaque. In the binary case we make this transparent and simpler by characterising mixability in terms of the second derivative of the Bayes risk of proper losses. We then extend this result to multiclass proper losses where there are few existing results. We show that mixability is governed by the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the Bayes risk, relative to the Hessian of the Bayes risk for log loss. We conclude by comparing our result to other work that bounds prediction performance in terms of the geometry of the Bayes risk. Although all calculations are for proper losses, we also show how to carry the results across to improper losses.

<p>Author: Gérard Biau</p><p>Abstract: Random forests are a scheme proposed by Leo Breiman in the 2000’s for building a predictor ensemble with a set of decision trees that grow in randomly selected subspaces of data. Despite growing interest and practical use, there has been little exploration of the statistical properties of random forests, and little is known about the mathematical forces driving the algorithm. In this paper, we offer an in-depth analysis of a random forests model suggested by Breiman (2004), which is very close to the original algorithm. We show in particular that the procedure is consistent and adapts to sparsity, in the sense that its rate of convergence depends only on the number of strong features and not on how many noise variables are present.

<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new perspective on spectral dimensionality reduction which views these methods as Gaussian Markov random ﬁelds (GRFs). Our unifying perspective is based on the maximum entropy principle which is in turn inspired by maximum variance unfolding. The resulting model, which we call maximum entropy unfolding (MEU) is a nonlinear generalization of principal component analysis. We relate the model to Laplacian eigenmaps and isomap. We show that parameter ﬁtting in the locally linear embedding (LLE) is approximate maximum likelihood MEU. We introduce a variant of LLE that performs maximum likelihood exactly: Acyclic LLE (ALLE). We show that MEU and ALLE are competitive with the leading spectral approaches on a robot navigation visualization and a human motion capture data set. Finally the maximum likelihood perspective allows us to introduce a new approach to dimensionality reduction based on L1 regularization of the Gaussian random ﬁeld via the graphical lasso.</p><p>5 0.28205338 <a title="5-lsi-5" href="./jmlr-2012-Mixability_is_Bayes_Risk_Curvature_Relative_to_Log_Loss.html">69 jmlr-2012-Mixability is Bayes Risk Curvature Relative to Log Loss</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael W. Mahoney, Lorenzo Orecchia, Nisheeth K. Vishnoi</p><p>Abstract: The second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix and its associated eigenvector are fundamental features of an undirected graph, and as such they have found widespread use in scientiﬁc computing, machine learning, and data analysis. In many applications, however, graphs that arise have several local regions of interest, and the second eigenvector will typically fail to provide information ﬁne-tuned to each local region. In this paper, we introduce a locally-biased analogue of the second eigenvector, and we demonstrate its usefulness at highlighting local properties of data graphs in a semi-supervised manner. To do so, we ﬁrst view the second eigenvector as the solution to a constrained optimization problem, and we incorporate the local information as an additional constraint; we then characterize the optimal solution to this new problem and show that it can be interpreted as a generalization of a Personalized PageRank vector; and ﬁnally, as a consequence, we show that the solution can be computed in nearly-linear time. In addition, we show that this locally-biased vector can be used to compute an approximation to the best partition near an input seed set in a manner analogous to the way in which the second eigenvector of the Laplacian can be used to obtain an approximation to the best partition in the entire input graph. Such a primitive is useful for identifying and reﬁning clusters locally, as it allows us to focus on a local region of interest in a semi-supervised manner. Finally, we provide a detailed empirical evaluation of our method by showing how it can applied to ﬁnding locally-biased sparse cuts around an input vertex seed set in social and information networks.

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Shusen Wang, Dehua Liu, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel framework for the construction of sparsity-inducing priors. In particular, we deﬁne such priors as a mixture of exponential power distributions with a generalized inverse Gaussian density (EP-GIG). EP-GIG is a variant of generalized hyperbolic distributions, and the special cases include Gaussian scale mixtures and Laplace scale mixtures. Furthermore, Laplace scale mixtures can subserve a Bayesian framework for sparse learning with nonconvex penalization. The densities of EP-GIG can be explicitly expressed. Moreover, the corresponding posterior distribution also follows a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. We exploit these properties to develop EM algorithms for sparse empirical Bayesian learning. We also show that these algorithms bear an interesting resemblance to iteratively reweighted ℓ2 or ℓ1 methods. Finally, we present two extensions for grouped variable selection and logistic regression.

<p>Author: Francesco Orabona, Luo Jie, Barbara Caputo</p><p>Abstract: In recent years there has been a lot of interest in designing principled classiﬁcation algorithms over multiple cues, based on the intuitive notion that using more features should lead to better performance. In the domain of kernel methods, a principled way to use multiple features is the Multi Kernel Learning (MKL) approach. Here we present a MKL optimization algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent that has a guaranteed convergence rate. We directly solve the MKL problem in the primal formulation. By having a p-norm formulation of MKL, we introduce a parameter that controls the level of sparsity of the solution, while leading to an easier optimization problem. We prove theoretically and experimentally that 1) our algorithm has a faster convergence rate as the number of kernels grows; 2) the training complexity is linear in the number of training examples; 3) very few iterations are sufﬁcient to reach good solutions. Experiments on standard benchmark databases support our claims.

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Dehua Liu, Guang Dai, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) naturally embody sparseness due to their use of hinge loss functions. However, SVMs can not directly estimate conditional class probabilities. In this paper we propose and study a family of coherence functions, which are convex and differentiable, as surrogates of the hinge function. The coherence function is derived by using the maximum-entropy principle and is characterized by a temperature parameter. It bridges the hinge function and the logit function in logistic regression. The limit of the coherence function at zero temperature corresponds to the hinge function, and the limit of the minimizer of its expected error is the minimizer of the expected error of the hinge loss. We refer to the use of the coherence function in large-margin classiﬁcation as “C -learning,” and we present efﬁcient coordinate descent algorithms for the training of regularized C -learning models.

<p>Author: Karthik Mohan, Maryam Fazel</p><p>Abstract: The problem of minimizing the rank of a matrix subject to afﬁne constraints has applications in several areas including machine learning, and is known to be NP-hard. A tractable relaxation for this problem is nuclear norm (or trace norm) minimization, which is guaranteed to ﬁnd the minimum rank matrix under suitable assumptions. In this paper, we propose a family of Iterative Reweighted Least Squares algorithms IRLS-p (with 0 ≤ p ≤ 1), as a computationally efﬁcient way to improve over the performance of nuclear norm minimization. The algorithms can be viewed as (locally) minimizing certain smooth approximations to the rank function. When p = 1, we give theoretical guarantees similar to those for nuclear norm minimization, that is, recovery of low-rank matrices under certain assumptions on the operator deﬁning the constraints. For p < 1, IRLSp shows better empirical performance in terms of recovering low-rank matrices than nuclear norm minimization. We provide an efﬁcient implementation for IRLS-p, and also present a related family of algorithms, sIRLS-p. These algorithms exhibit competitive run times and improved recovery when compared to existing algorithms for random instances of the matrix completion problem, as well as on the MovieLens movie recommendation data set.

We study how an adversary can systematically query a classiﬁer to elicit information that allows the attacker to evade detection while incurring a near-minimal cost of modifying their intended malfeasance. We generalize the theory of Lowd and Meek (2005) to the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers that partition their feature space into two sets, one of which is convex. We present query algorithms for this family that construct undetected instances of approximately minimal cost using only polynomially-many queries in the dimension of the space and in the level of approximation. Our results demonstrate that nearoptimal evasion can be accomplished for this family without reverse engineering the classiﬁer’s decision boundary. We also consider general ℓ p costs and show that near-optimal evasion on the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers is generally efﬁcient for both positive and negative convexity for all levels of approximation if p = 1.

<p>Author: Konstantin Voevodski, Maria-Florina Balcan, Heiko Röglin, Shang-Hua Teng, Yu Xia</p><p>Abstract: Given a point set S and an unknown metric d on S, we study the problem of efﬁciently partitioning S into k clusters while querying few distances between the points. In our model we assume that we have access to one versus all queries that given a point s ∈ S return the distances between s and all other points. We show that given a natural assumption about the structure of the instance, we can efﬁciently ﬁnd an accurate clustering using only O(k) distance queries. Our algorithm uses an active selection strategy to choose a small set of points that we call landmarks, and considers only the distances between landmarks and other points to produce a clustering. We use our procedure to cluster proteins by sequence similarity. This setting nicely ﬁts our model because we can use a fast sequence database search program to query a sequence against an entire data set. We conduct an empirical study that shows that even though we query a small fraction of the distances between the points, we produce clusterings that are close to a desired clustering given by manual classiﬁcation.

<p>Author: Kay H. Brodersen, Christoph Mathys, Justin R. Chumbley, Jean Daunizeau, Cheng Soon Ong, Joachim M. Buhmann, Klaas E. Stephan</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁcation algorithms are frequently used on data with a natural hierarchical structure. For instance, classiﬁers are often trained and tested on trial-wise measurements, separately for each subject within a group. One important question is how classiﬁcation outcomes observed in individual subjects can be generalized to the population from which the group was sampled. To address this question, this paper introduces novel statistical models that are guided by three desiderata. First, all models explicitly respect the hierarchical nature of the data, that is, they are mixed-effects models that simultaneously account for within-subjects (ﬁxed-effects) and across-subjects (random-effects) variance components. Second, maximum-likelihood estimation is replaced by full Bayesian inference in order to enable natural regularization of the estimation problem and to afford conclusions in terms of posterior probability statements. Third, inference on classiﬁcation accuracy is complemented by inference on the balanced accuracy, which avoids inﬂated accuracy estimates for imbalanced data sets. We introduce hierarchical models that satisfy these criteria and demonstrate their advantages over conventional methods using MCMC implementations for model inversion and model selection on both synthetic and empirical data. We envisage that our approach will improve the sensitivity and validity of statistical inference in future hierarchical classiﬁcation studies.

<p>Author: Michael U. Gutmann, Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: We consider the task of estimating, from observed data, a probabilistic model that is parameterized by a ﬁnite number of parameters. In particular, we are considering the situation where the model probability density function is unnormalized. That is, the model is only speciﬁed up to the partition function. The partition function normalizes a model so that it integrates to one for any choice of the parameters. However, it is often impossible to obtain it in closed form. Gibbs distributions, Markov and multi-layer networks are examples of models where analytical normalization is often impossible. Maximum likelihood estimation can then not be used without resorting to numerical approximations which are often computationally expensive. We propose here a new objective function for the estimation of both normalized and unnormalized models. The basic idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artiﬁcially generated noise. With this approach, the normalizing partition function can be estimated like any other parameter. We prove that the new estimation method leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters. For large noise sample sizes, the new estimator is furthermore shown to behave like the maximum likelihood estimator. In the estimation of unnormalized models, there is a trade-off between statistical and computational performance. We show that the new method strikes a competitive trade-off in comparison to other estimation methods for unnormalized models. As an application to real data, we estimate novel two-layer models of natural image statistics with spline nonlinearities.

<p>Author: Alessandro Rinaldo, Aarti Singh, Rebecca Nugent, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: High density clusters can be characterized by the connected components of a level set L(λ) = {x : p(x) > λ} of the underlying probability density function p generating the data, at some appropriate level λ ≥ 0. The complete hierarchical clustering can be characterized by a cluster tree T = λ L(λ). In this paper, we study the behavior of a density level set estimate L(λ) and cluster tree estimate T based on a kernel density estimator with kernel bandwidth h. We deﬁne two notions of instability to measure the variability of L(λ) and T as a function of h, and investigate the theoretical properties of these instability measures.

The algorithm is based on a modiﬁcation of Grover’s quantum search algorithm (Grover, 1996). We present algorithms for pattern retrieval, pattern completion, and pattern correction. We show that the quantum associative memory can store an exponential number of memories and retrieve them in sub-exponential time. We prove that this model has advantages over known classical associative memories as well as previously proposed quantum models.

<p>Author: Mario Frank, Andreas P. Streich, David Basin, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic model for clustering Boolean data where an object can be simultaneously assigned to multiple clusters. By explicitly modeling the underlying generative process that combines the individual source emissions, highly structured data are expressed with substantially fewer clusters compared to single-assignment clustering. As a consequence, such a model provides robust parameter estimators even when the number of samples is low. We extend the model with different noise processes and demonstrate that maximum-likelihood estimation with multiple assignments consistently infers source parameters more accurately than single-assignment clustering. Our model is primarily motivated by the task of role mining for role-based access control, where users of a system are assigned one or more roles. In experiments with real-world access-control data, our model exhibits better generalization performance than state-of-the-art approaches.

<p>Author: Ji Liu, Peter Wonka, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the following sparse signal recovery (or feature selection) problem: given a design matrix X ∈ Rn×m (m ≫ n) and a noisy observation vector y ∈ Rn satisfying y = Xβ∗ + ε where ε is the noise vector following a Gaussian distribution N(0, σ2 I), how to recover the signal (or parameter vector) β∗ when the signal is sparse? The Dantzig selector has been proposed for sparse signal recovery with strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage Dantzig selector method, which iteratively reﬁnes the target signal β∗ . We show that if X obeys a certain condition, then with a large probability ˆ the difference between the solution β estimated by the proposed method and the true solution β∗ measured in terms of the ℓ p norm (p ≥ 1) is bounded as ˆ β − β∗ p ≤ C(s − N)1/p log m + ∆ σ, where C is a constant, s is the number of nonzero entries in β∗ , the risk of the oracle estimator ∆ is independent of m and is much smaller than the ﬁrst term, and N is the number of entries of β∗ larger √ than a certain value in the order of O (σ log m). The proposed √ method improves the estimation √ bound of the standard Dantzig selector approximately from Cs1/p log mσ to C(s − N)1/p log mσ where the value N depends on the number of large entries in β∗ . When N = s, the proposed algorithm achieves the oracle solution with a high probability, where the oracle solution is the projection of the observation vector y onto true features. In addition, with a large probability, the proposed method can select the same number of correct features under a milder condition than the Dantzig selector. Finally, we extend this multi-stage procedure to the LASSO case.

<p>Author: Blaine Nelson, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein, Ling Huang, Anthony D. Joseph, Steven J. Lee, Satish Rao, J. D. Tygar</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁers are often used to detect miscreant activities. We study how an adversary can systematically query a classiﬁer to elicit information that allows the attacker to evade detection while incurring a near-minimal cost of modifying their intended malfeasance. We generalize the theory of Lowd and Meek (2005) to the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers that partition their feature space into two sets, one of which is convex. We present query algorithms for this family that construct undetected instances of approximately minimal cost using only polynomially-many queries in the dimension of the space and in the level of approximation. Our results demonstrate that nearoptimal evasion can be accomplished for this family without reverse engineering the classiﬁer’s decision boundary. We also consider general ℓ p costs and show that near-optimal evasion on the family of convex-inducing classiﬁers is generally efﬁcient for both positive and negative convexity for all levels of approximation if p = 1.

<p>Author: Xiaogang Su, Joseph Kang, Juanjuan Fan, Richard A. Levine, Xin Yan</p><p>Abstract: Assessing treatment effects in observational studies is a multifaceted problem that not only involves heterogeneous mechanisms of how the treatment or cause is exposed to subjects, known as propensity, but also differential causal effects across sub-populations. We introduce a concept termed the facilitating score to account for both the confounding and interacting impacts of covariates on the treatment effect. Several approaches for estimating the facilitating score are discussed. In particular, we put forward a machine learning method, called causal inference tree (CIT), to provide a piecewise constant approximation of the facilitating score. With interpretable rules, CIT splits data in such a way that both the propensity and the treatment effect become more homogeneous within each resultant partition. Causal inference at different levels can be made on the basis of CIT. Together with an aggregated grouping procedure, CIT stratiﬁes data into strata where causal effects can be conveniently assessed within each. Besides, a feasible way of predicting individual causal effects (ICE) is made available by aggregating ensemble CIT models. Both the stratiﬁed results and the estimated ICE provide an assessment of heterogeneity of causal effects and can be integrated for estimating the average causal effect (ACE). Mean square consistency of CIT is also established. We evaluate the performance of proposed methods with simulations and illustrate their use with the NSW data in Dehejia and Wahba (1999) where the objective is to assess the impact of c 2012 Xiaogang Su, Joseph Kang, Juanjuan Fan, Richard A.

<p>Author: Rahul Mazumder,  Trevor Hastie</p><p>Abstract: We consider the sparse inverse covariance regularization problem or graphical lasso with regularization parameter λ. Suppose the sample covariance graph formed by thresholding the entries of the sample covariance matrix at λ is decomposed into connected components. We show that the vertex-partition induced by the connected components of the thresholded sample covariance graph (at λ) is exactly equal to that induced by the connected components of the estimated concentration graph, obtained by solving the graphical lasso problem for the same λ. This characterizes a very interesting property of a path of graphical lasso solutions. Furthermore, this simple rule, when used as a wrapper around existing algorithms for the graphical lasso, leads to enormous performance gains. For a range of values of λ, our proposal splits a large graphical lasso problem into smaller tractable problems, making it possible to solve an otherwise infeasible large-scale problem. We illustrate the graceful scalability of our proposal via synthetic and real-life microarray examples.

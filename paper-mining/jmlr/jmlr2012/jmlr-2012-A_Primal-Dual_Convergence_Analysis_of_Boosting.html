<p>Author: Chunhua Shen, Junae Kim, Lei Wang, Anton van den Hengel</p><p>Abstract: The success of many machine learning and pattern recognition methods relies heavily upon the identiﬁcation of an appropriate distance metric on the input data. It is often beneﬁcial to learn such a metric from the input training data, instead of using a default one such as the Euclidean distance. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed B OOST M ETRIC, for learning a quadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the metric remains positive semideﬁnite. Semideﬁnite programming is often used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and is not easy to implement. B OOST M ETRIC is instead based on the observation that any positive semideﬁnite matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. B OOST M ETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semideﬁnite matrices as weak learners within an efﬁcient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting methods are easy to implement, efﬁcient, and can accommodate various types of constraints. We extend traditional boosting algorithms in that its weak learner is a positive semideﬁnite matrix with trace and rank being one rather than a classiﬁer or regressor. Experiments on various data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms compare favorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and running time.

<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: There is growing body of learning problems for which it is natural to organize the parameters into a matrix. As a result, it becomes easy to impose sophisticated prior knowledge by appropriately regularizing the parameters under some matrix norm. This work describes and analyzes a systematic method for constructing such matrix-based regularization techniques. In particular, we focus on how the underlying statistical properties of a given problem can help us decide which regularization function is appropriate. Our methodology is based on a known duality phenomenon: a function is strongly convex with respect to some norm if and only if its conjugate function is strongly smooth with respect to the dual norm. This result has already been found to be a key component in deriving and analyzing several learning algorithms. We demonstrate the potential of this framework by deriving novel generalization and regret bounds for multi-task learning, multi-class learning, and multiple kernel learning.

<p>Author: Ji Liu, Peter Wonka, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the following sparse signal recovery (or feature selection) problem: given a design matrix X ∈ Rn×m (m ≫ n) and a noisy observation vector y ∈ Rn satisfying y = Xβ∗ + ε where ε is the noise vector following a Gaussian distribution N(0, σ2 I), how to recover the signal (or parameter vector) β∗ when the signal is sparse? The Dantzig selector has been proposed for sparse signal recovery with strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage Dantzig selector method, which iteratively reﬁnes the target signal β∗ . We show that if X obeys a certain condition, then with a large probability ˆ the difference between the solution β estimated by the proposed method and the true solution β∗ measured in terms of the ℓ p norm (p ≥ 1) is bounded as ˆ β − β∗ p ≤ C(s − N)1/p log m + ∆ σ, where C is a constant, s is the number of nonzero entries in β∗ , the risk of the oracle estimator ∆ is independent of m and is much smaller than the ﬁrst term, and N is the number of entries of β∗ larger √ than a certain value in the order of O (σ log m). The proposed √ method improves the estimation √ bound of the standard Dantzig selector approximately from Cs1/p log mσ to C(s − N)1/p log mσ where the value N depends on the number of large entries in β∗ . When N = s, the proposed algorithm achieves the oracle solution with a high probability, where the oracle solution is the projection of the observation vector y onto true features. In addition, with a large probability, the proposed method can select the same number of correct features under a milder condition than the Dantzig selector. Finally, we extend this multi-stage procedure to the LASSO case.

<p>Author: Christopher Genovese, Marco Perone-Pacifico, Isabella Verdinelli, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: We ﬁnd the minimax rate of convergence in Hausdorff distance for estimating a manifold M of dimension d embedded in RD given a noisy sample from the manifold. Under certain conditions, we show that the optimal rate of convergence is n−2/(2+d) . Thus, the minimax rate depends only on the dimension of the manifold, not on the dimension of the space in which M is embedded.

<p>Author: Matus Telgarsky</p><p>Abstract: Boosting combines weak learners into a predictor with low empirical risk. Its dual constructs a high entropy distribution upon which weak learners and training labels are uncorrelated. This manuscript studies this primal-dual relationship under a broad family of losses, including the exponential loss of AdaBoost and the logistic loss, revealing: • Weak learnability aids the whole loss family: for any ε > 0, O (ln(1/ε)) iterations sufﬁce to produce a predictor with empirical risk ε-close to the inﬁmum; • The circumstances granting the existence of an empirical risk minimizer may be characterized in terms of the primal and dual problems, yielding a new proof of the known rate O (ln(1/ε)); • Arbitrary instances may be decomposed into the above two, granting rate O (1/ε), with a matching lower bound provided for the logistic loss.

<p>Author: Yiming Ying, Peng Li</p><p>Abstract: The main theme of this paper is to develop a novel eigenvalue optimization framework for learning a Mahalanobis metric. Within this context, we introduce a novel metric learning approach called DML-eig which is shown to be equivalent to a well-known eigenvalue optimization problem called minimizing the maximal eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix (Overton, 1988; Lewis and Overton, 1996). Moreover, we formulate LMNN (Weinberger et al., 2005), one of the state-of-the-art metric learning methods, as a similar eigenvalue optimization problem. This novel framework not only provides new insights into metric learning but also opens new avenues to the design of efﬁcient metric learning algorithms. Indeed, ﬁrst-order algorithms are developed for DML-eig and LMNN which only need the computation of the largest eigenvector of a matrix per iteration. Their convergence characteristics are rigorously established. Various experiments on benchmark data sets show the competitive performance of our new approaches. In addition, we report an encouraging result on a difﬁcult and challenging face veriﬁcation data set called Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW).

<p>Author: Jia Zeng</p><p>Abstract: Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is an important hierarchical Bayesian model for probabilistic topic modeling, which attracts worldwide interests and touches on many important applications in text mining, computer vision and computational biology. This paper introduces a topic modeling toolbox (TMBP) based on the belief propagation (BP) algorithms. TMBP toolbox is implemented by MEX C++/Matlab/Octave for either Windows 7 or Linux. Compared with existing topic modeling packages, the novelty of this toolbox lies in the BP algorithms for learning LDA-based topic models. The current version includes BP algorithms for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), authortopic models (ATM), relational topic models (RTM), and labeled LDA (LaLDA). This toolbox is an ongoing project and more BP-based algorithms for various topic models will be added in the near future. Interested users may also extend BP algorithms for learning more complicated topic models.

<p>Author: Stanislav Minsker</p><p>Abstract: We present a new active learning algorithm based on nonparametric estimators of the regression function. Our investigation provides probabilistic bounds for the rates of convergence of the generalization error achievable by proposed method over a broad class of underlying distributions. We also prove minimax lower bounds which show that the obtained rates are almost tight.

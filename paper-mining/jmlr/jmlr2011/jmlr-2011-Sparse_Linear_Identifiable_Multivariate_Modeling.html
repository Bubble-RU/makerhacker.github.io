<p>Author: Vianney Perchet</p><p>Abstract: We provide consistent random algorithms for sequential decision under partial monitoring, when the decision maker does not observe the outcomes but receives instead random feedback signals. Those algorithms have no internal regret in the sense that, on the set of stages where the decision maker chose his action according to a given law, the average payoff could not have been improved in average by using any other ﬁxed law. They are based on a generalization of calibration, no longer deﬁned in terms of a Vorono¨ ı diagram but instead of a Laguerre diagram (a more general concept). This allows us to bound, for the ﬁrst time in this general framework, the expected average internal, as well as the usual external, regret at stage n by O(n−1/3 ), which is known to be optimal.

Hoyer, Kenneth Bollen</p><p>Abstract: Structural equation models and Bayesian networks have been widely used to analyze causal relations between continuous variables. In such frameworks, linear acyclic models are typically used to model the data-generating process of variables. Recently, it was shown that use of non-Gaussianity identiﬁes the full structure of a linear acyclic model, that is, a causal ordering of variables and their connection strengths, without using any prior knowledge on the network structure, which is not the case with conventional methods. However, existing estimation methods are based on iterative search algorithms and may not converge to a correct solution in a ﬁnite number of steps. In this paper, we propose a new direct method to estimate a causal ordering and connection strengths based on non-Gaussianity. In contrast to the previous methods, our algorithm requires no algorithmic parameters and is guaranteed to converge to the right solution within a small ﬁxed number of steps if the data strictly follows the model, that is, if all the model assumptions are met and the sample size is inﬁnite.

<p>Author: Cassio P. de Campos, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning Bayesian network structures from data based on score functions that are decomposable. It describes properties that strongly reduce the time and memory costs of many known methods without losing global optimality guarantees. These properties are derived for different score criteria such as Minimum Description Length (or Bayesian Information Criterion), Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Dirichlet Criterion. Then a branch-andbound algorithm is presented that integrates structural constraints with data in a way to guarantee global optimality. As an example, structural constraints are used to map the problem of structure learning in Dynamic Bayesian networks into a corresponding augmented Bayesian network. Finally, we show empirically the beneﬁts of using the properties with state-of-the-art methods and with the new algorithm, which is able to handle larger data sets than before.

<p>Author: John Duchi, Elad Hazan, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to ﬁnd needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efﬁcient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.

<p>Author: Yoshinori Tamada, Seiya Imoto, Satoru Miyano</p><p>Abstract: We present a parallel algorithm for the score-based optimal structure search of Bayesian networks. This algorithm is based on a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm having O(n · 2n ) time and space complexity, which is known to be the fastest algorithm for the optimal structure search of networks with n nodes. The bottleneck of the problem is the memory requirement, and therefore, the algorithm is currently applicable for up to a few tens of nodes. While the recently proposed algorithm overcomes this limitation by a space-time trade-off, our proposed algorithm realizes direct parallelization of the original DP algorithm with O(nσ ) time and space overhead calculations, where σ > 0 controls the communication-space trade-off. The overall time and space complexity is O(nσ+1 2n ). This algorithm splits the search space so that the required communication between independent calculations is minimal. Because of this advantage, our algorithm can run on distributed memory supercomputers. Through computational experiments, we conﬁrmed that our algorithm can run in parallel using up to 256 processors with a parallelization efﬁciency of 0.74, compared to the original DP algorithm with a single processor. We also demonstrate optimal structure search for a 32-node network without any constraints, which is the largest network search presented in literature.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discrete-valued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, one is required to give conditional probabilities of the next observation. The realizable case is when the measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of process measures. The non-realizable case is when µ is completely arbitrary, but the prediction performance is measured with respect to a given set C of process measures. We are interested in the relations between these problems and between their solutions, as well as in characterizing the cases when a solution exists and ﬁnding these solutions. We show that if the quality of prediction is measured using the total variation distance, then these problems coincide, while if it is measured using the expected average KL divergence, then they are different. For some of the formalizations we also show that when a solution exists it can be obtained as a Bayes mixture over a countable subset of C . We also obtain several characterization of those sets C for which solutions to the considered problems exist. As an illustration to the general results obtained, we show that a solution to the non-realizable case of the sequence prediction problem exists for the set of all ﬁnite-memory processes, but does not exist for the set of all stationary processes. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the processes measures considered are not required to be i.i.d., mixing, stationary, or to belong to any parametric family.

<p>Author: Chiwoo Park, Jianhua Z. Huang, Yu Ding</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian process regression is a ﬂexible and powerful tool for machine learning, but the high computational complexity hinders its broader applications. In this paper, we propose a new approach for fast computation of Gaussian process regression with a focus on large spatial data sets. The approach decomposes the domain of a regression function into small subdomains and infers a local piece of the regression function for each subdomain. We explicitly address the mismatch problem of the local pieces on the boundaries of neighboring subdomains by imposing continuity constraints. The new approach has comparable or better computation complexity as other competing methods, but it is easier to be parallelized for faster computation. Moreover, the method can be adaptive to non-stationary features because of its local nature and, in particular, its use of different hyperparameters of the covariance function for different local regions. We illustrate application of the method and demonstrate its advantages over existing methods using two synthetic data sets and two real spatial data sets.

<p>Author: Ricardo Henao, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider sparse and identiﬁable linear latent variable (factor) and linear Bayesian network models for parsimonious analysis of multivariate data. We propose a computationally efﬁcient method for joint parameter and model inference, and model comparison. It consists of a fully Bayesian hierarchy for sparse models using slab and spike priors (two-component δ-function and continuous mixtures), non-Gaussian latent factors and a stochastic search over the ordering of the variables. The framework, which we call SLIM (Sparse Linear Identiﬁable Multivariate modeling), is validated and bench-marked on artiﬁcial and real biological data sets. SLIM is closest in spirit to LiNGAM (Shimizu et al., 2006), but differs substantially in inference, Bayesian network structure learning and model comparison. Experimentally, SLIM performs equally well or better than LiNGAM with comparable computational complexity. We attribute this mainly to the stochastic search strategy used, and to parsimony (sparsity and identiﬁability), which is an explicit part of the model. We propose two extensions to the basic i.i.d. linear framework: non-linear dependence on observed variables, called SNIM (Sparse Non-linear Identiﬁable Multivariate modeling) and allowing for correlations between latent variables, called CSLIM (Correlated SLIM), for the temporal and/or spatial data. The source code and scripts are available from http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/slim/.

<p>Author: Myung Jin Choi, Vincent Y. F. Tan, Animashree Anandkumar, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a latent tree graphical model where samples are available only from a subset of variables. We propose two consistent and computationally efﬁcient algorithms for learning minimal latent trees, that is, trees without any redundant hidden nodes. Unlike many existing methods, the observed nodes (or variables) are not constrained to be leaf nodes. Our algorithms can be applied to both discrete and Gaussian random variables and our learned models are such that all the observed and latent variables have the same domain (state space). Our ﬁrst algorithm, recursive grouping, builds the latent tree recursively by identifying sibling groups using so-called information distances. One of the main contributions of this work is our second algorithm, which we refer to as CLGrouping. CLGrouping starts with a pre-processing procedure in which a tree over the observed variables is constructed. This global step groups the observed nodes that are likely to be close to each other in the true latent tree, thereby guiding subsequent recursive grouping (or equivalent procedures such as neighbor-joining) on much smaller subsets of variables. This results in more accurate and efﬁcient learning of latent trees. We also present regularized versions of our algorithms that learn latent tree approximations of arbitrary distributions. We compare the proposed algorithms to other methods by performing extensive numerical experiments on various latent tree graphical models such as hidden Markov models and star graphs. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of our methods on real-world data sets by modeling the dependency structure of monthly stock returns in the S&P; index and of the words in the 20 newsgroups data set.

<p>Author: David M. Blei, Peter I. Frazier</p><p>Abstract: We develop the distance dependent Chinese restaurant process, a ﬂexible class of distributions over partitions that allows for dependencies between the elements. This class can be used to model many kinds of dependencies between data in inﬁnite clustering models, including dependencies arising from time, space, and network connectivity. We examine the properties of the distance dependent CRP, discuss its connections to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models, and derive a Gibbs sampler for both fully observed and latent mixture settings. We study its empirical performance with three text corpora. We show that relaxing the assumption of exchangeability with distance dependent CRPs can provide a better ﬁt to sequential data and network data. We also show that the distance dependent CRP representation of the traditional CRP mixture leads to a faster-mixing Gibbs sampling algorithm than the one based on the original formulation.

<p>Author: Graham W. Taylor, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop a class of nonlinear generative models for high-dimensional time series. We ﬁrst propose a model based on the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that uses an undirected model with binary latent variables and real-valued “visible” variables. The latent and visible variables at each time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last few time-steps. This “conditional” RBM (CRBM) makes on-line inference efﬁcient and allows us to use a simple approximate learning procedure. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various sequences from a model trained on motion capture data and by performing on-line ﬁlling in of data lost during capture. We extend the CRBM in a way that preserves its most important computational properties and introduces multiplicative three-way interactions that allow the effective interaction weight between two variables to be modulated by the dynamic state of a third variable. We introduce a factoring of the implied three-way weight tensor to permit a more compact parameterization. The resulting model can capture diverse styles of motion with a single set of parameters, and the three-way interactions greatly improve its ability to blend motion styles or to transition smoothly among them.

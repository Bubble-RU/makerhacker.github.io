<p>Author: Myung Jin Choi, Vincent Y. F. Tan, Animashree Anandkumar, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a latent tree graphical model where samples are available only from a subset of variables. We propose two consistent and computationally efﬁcient algorithms for learning minimal latent trees, that is, trees without any redundant hidden nodes. Unlike many existing methods, the observed nodes (or variables) are not constrained to be leaf nodes. Our algorithms can be applied to both discrete and Gaussian random variables and our learned models are such that all the observed and latent variables have the same domain (state space). Our ﬁrst algorithm, recursive grouping, builds the latent tree recursively by identifying sibling groups using so-called information distances. One of the main contributions of this work is our second algorithm, which we refer to as CLGrouping. CLGrouping starts with a pre-processing procedure in which a tree over the observed variables is constructed. This global step groups the observed nodes that are likely to be close to each other in the true latent tree, thereby guiding subsequent recursive grouping (or equivalent procedures such as neighbor-joining) on much smaller subsets of variables. This results in more accurate and efﬁcient learning of latent trees. We also present regularized versions of our algorithms that learn latent tree approximations of arbitrary distributions. We compare the proposed algorithms to other methods by performing extensive numerical experiments on various latent tree graphical models such as hidden Markov models and star graphs. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of our methods on real-world data sets by modeling the dependency structure of monthly stock returns in the S&P; index and of the words in the 20 newsgroups data set.

<p>Author: Brian McFee, Gert Lanckriet</p><p>Abstract: In many applications involving multi-media data, the deﬁnition of similarity between items is integral to several key tasks, including nearest-neighbor retrieval, classiﬁcation, and recommendation. Data in such regimes typically exhibits multiple modalities, such as acoustic and visual content of video. Integrating such heterogeneous data to form a holistic similarity space is therefore a key challenge to be overcome in many real-world applications. We present a novel multiple kernel learning technique for integrating heterogeneous data into a single, uniﬁed similarity space. Our algorithm learns an optimal ensemble of kernel transformations which conform to measurements of human perceptual similarity, as expressed by relative comparisons. To cope with the ubiquitous problems of subjectivity and inconsistency in multimedia similarity, we develop graph-based techniques to ﬁlter similarity measurements, resulting in a simpliﬁed and robust training procedure.

<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Ulf Brefeld, Sören Sonnenburg, Alexander Zien</p><p>Abstract: Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy when the right choice of features is unknown. Previous approaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability and scalability. Unfortunately, this ℓ1 -norm MKL is rarely observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures that generalize well, we extend MKL to arbitrary norms. We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efﬁcient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary norms, that is ℓ p -norms with p ≥ 1. This interleaved optimization is much faster than the commonly used wrapper approaches, as demonstrated on several data sets. A theoretical analysis and an experiment on controlled artiﬁcial data shed light on the appropriateness of sparse, non-sparse and ℓ∞ -norm MKL in various scenarios. Importantly, empirical applications of ℓ p -norm MKL to three real-world problems from computational biology show that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that surpass the state-of-the-art.

<p>Author: Jinfeng Zhuang, Ivor W. Tsang, Steven C.H. Hoi</p><p>Abstract: Previous studies of Non-Parametric Kernel Learning (NPKL) usually formulate the learning task as a Semi-Deﬁnite Programming (SDP) problem that is often solved by some general purpose SDP solvers. However, for N data examples, the time complexity of NPKL using a standard interiorpoint SDP solver could be as high as O(N 6.5 ), which prohibits NPKL methods applicable to real applications, even for data sets of moderate size. In this paper, we present a family of efﬁcient NPKL algorithms, termed “SimpleNPKL”, which can learn non-parametric kernels from a large set of pairwise constraints efﬁciently. In particular, we propose two efﬁcient SimpleNPKL algorithms. One is SimpleNPKL algorithm with linear loss, which enjoys a closed-form solution that can be efﬁciently computed by the Lanczos sparse eigen decomposition technique. Another one is SimpleNPKL algorithm with other loss functions (including square hinge loss, hinge loss, square loss) that can be re-formulated as a saddle-point optimization problem, which can be further resolved by a fast iterative algorithm. In contrast to the previous NPKL approaches, our empirical results show that the proposed new technique, maintaining the same accuracy, is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient and scalable. Finally, we also demonstrate that the proposed new technique is also applicable to speed up many kernel learning tasks, including colored maximum variance unfolding, minimum volume embedding, and structure preserving embedding.

<p>Author: Michael Hahsler, Sudheer Chelluboina, Kurt Hornik, Christian Buchta</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the ecosystem of R add-on packages developed around the infrastructure provided by the package arules. The packages provide comprehensive functionality for analyzing interesting patterns including frequent itemsets, association rules, frequent sequences and for building applications like associative classiﬁcation. After discussing the ecosystem’s design we illustrate the ease of mining and visualizing rules with a short example. Keywords: frequent itemsets, association rules, frequent sequences, visualization 1. Overview Mining frequent itemsets and association rules is a popular and well researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. Association rules are used in many applications and have become prominent as an important exploratory method for uncovering cross-selling opportunities in large retail databases. Agrawal et al. (1993) introduced the problem of mining association rules from transaction data as follows: Let I = {i1 , i2 , . . . , in } be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let D = {t1 ,t2 , . . . ,tm } be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I. A rule is deﬁned as an implication of the form X ⇒ Y where / X,Y ⊆ I and X ∩ Y = 0 are called itemsets. On itemsets and rules several quality measures can be deﬁned. The most important measures are support and conﬁdence. The support supp(X) of an itemset X is deﬁned as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the itemset. Itemsets with a support which surpasses a user deﬁned threshold σ are called frequent itemsets. The conﬁdence of a rule is deﬁned as conf(X ⇒ Y ) = supp(X ∪Y )/supp(X). Association rules are rules with supp(X ∪Y ) ≥ σ and conf(X) ≥ δ where σ and δ are user deﬁned thresholds. ©2011 Michael Hahsler, Sudheer Chelluboina, Kurt Hornik and Christian Buchta. H AHSLER , C HELLUBOINA , H ORNIK AND B UCHTA Figure 1: The arules ecosystem. The R package arules (Hahsler et al., 2005, 2010) implements the basic infrastructure for creating and manipulating transaction databases and basic algorithms to efﬁciently ﬁnd and analyze association rules. Over the last ﬁve years several packages were built around the arules infrastructure to create the ecosystem shown in Figure 1. Compared to other tools, the arules ecosystem is fully integrated, implements the latest approaches and has the vast functionality of R for further analysis of found patterns at its disposal. 2. Design and Implementation The core package arules provides an object-oriented framework to represent transaction databases and patterns. To facilitate extensibility, patterns are implemented as an abstract superclass associations and then concrete subclasses implement individual types of patterns. In arules the associations itemsets and rules are provided. Databases and associations both use a sparse matrix representation for efﬁcient storage and basic operations like sorting, subsetting and matching are supported. Different aspects of arules were discussed in previous publications (Hahsler et al., 2005; Hahsler and Hornik, 2007b,a; Hahsler et al., 2008). In this paper we focus on the ecosystem of several R-packages which are built on top of the arules infrastructure. While arules provides Apriori and Eclat (implementations by Borgelt, 2003), two of the most important frequent itemset/association rule mining algorithms, additional algorithms can easily be added as new packages. For example, package arulesNBMiner (Hahsler, 2010) implements an algorithm to ﬁnd NB-frequent itemsets (Hahsler, 2006). A collection of further implementations which could be interfaced by arules in the future and a comparison of state-of-the-art algorithms can be found at the Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Repository.1 arulesSequences (Buchta and Hahsler, 2010) implements mining frequent sequences in transaction databases. It implements additional association classes called sequences and sequencerules and provides the algorithm cSpade (Zaki, 2001) to efﬁciently mine frequent sequences. Another application currently under development is arulesClassify which uses the arules infrastructure to implement rule-based classiﬁers, including Classiﬁcation Based on Association rules (CBA, Liu et al., 1998) and general associative classiﬁcation techniques (Jalali-Heravi and Zaïane, 2010). A known drawback of mining for frequent patterns such as association rules is that typically the algorithm returns a very large set of results where only a small fraction of patterns is of interest to the analysts. Many researchers introduced visualization techniques including scatter plots, matrix 1.

Finally, arules provides a Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) interface to import and export rules via package pmml (Williams et al., 2010). PMML is the leading standard for exchanging statistical and data mining models and is supported by all major solution providers. Although pmml provides interfaces for different packages it is still considered part of the arules ecosystem. The packages in the described ecosystem are available for Linux, OS X and Windows. All packages are distributed via the Comprehensive R Archive Network2 under GPL-2, along with comprehensive manuals, documentation, regression tests and source code. Development versions of most packages are available from R-Forge.3 3. User Interface We illustrate the user interface and the interaction between the packages in the arules ecosystem with a small example using a retail data set called Groceries which contains 9835 transactions with items aggregated to 169 categories. We mine association rules and then present the rules found as well as the top 3 rules according to the interest measure lift (deviation from independence) in two visualizations. > > > > library(</p><p>same-paper 2 0.93906409 <a title="103-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2011-Weisfeiler-Lehman_Graph_Kernels.html">103 jmlr-2011-Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Nino Shervashidze, Pascal Schweitzer, Erik Jan van Leeuwen, Kurt Mehlhorn, Karsten M. Borgwardt</p><p>Abstract: In this article, we propose a family of efﬁcient kernels for large graphs with discrete node labels. Key to our method is a rapid feature extraction scheme based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman test of isomorphism on graphs. It maps the original graph to a sequence of graphs, whose node attributes capture topological and label information. A family of kernels can be deﬁned based on this Weisfeiler-Lehman sequence of graphs, including a highly efﬁcient kernel comparing subtree-like patterns. Its runtime scales only linearly in the number of edges of the graphs and the length of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph sequence. In our experimental evaluation, our kernels outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels on several graph classiﬁcation benchmark data sets in terms of accuracy and runtime. Our kernels open the door to large-scale applications of graph kernels in various disciplines such as computational biology and social network analysis.

<p>Author: Thomas L. Griffiths, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: The Indian buffet process is a stochastic process deﬁning a probability distribution over equivalence classes of sparse binary matrices with a ﬁnite number of rows and an unbounded number of columns. This distribution is suitable for use as a prior in probabilistic models that represent objects using a potentially inﬁnite array of features, or that involve bipartite graphs in which the size of at least one class of nodes is unknown. We give a detailed derivation of this distribution, and illustrate its use as a prior in an inﬁnite latent feature model. We then review recent applications of the Indian buffet process in machine learning, discuss its extensions, and summarize its connections to other stochastic processes.

<p>Author: David M. Blei, Peter I. Frazier</p><p>Abstract: We develop the distance dependent Chinese restaurant process, a ﬂexible class of distributions over partitions that allows for dependencies between the elements. This class can be used to model many kinds of dependencies between data in inﬁnite clustering models, including dependencies arising from time, space, and network connectivity. We examine the properties of the distance dependent CRP, discuss its connections to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models, and derive a Gibbs sampler for both fully observed and latent mixture settings. We study its empirical performance with three text corpora. We show that relaxing the assumption of exchangeability with distance dependent CRPs can provide a better ﬁt to sequential data and network data. We also show that the distance dependent CRP representation of the traditional CRP mixture leads to a faster-mixing Gibbs sampling algorithm than the one based on the original formulation.

<p>Author: Sharon Goldwater, Thomas L. Griffiths, Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Standard statistical models of language fail to capture one of the most striking properties of natural languages: the power-law distribution in the frequencies of word tokens. We present a framework for developing statistical models that can generically produce power laws, breaking generative models into two stages. The ﬁrst stage, the generator, can be any standard probabilistic model, while the second stage, the adaptor, transforms the word frequencies of this model to provide a closer match to natural language. We show that two commonly used Bayesian models, the Dirichlet-multinomial model and the Dirichlet process, can be viewed as special cases of our framework. We discuss two stochastic processes—the Chinese restaurant process and its two-parameter generalization based on the Pitman-Yor process—that can be used as adaptors in our framework to produce power-law distributions over word frequencies. We show that these adaptors justify common estimation procedures based on logarithmic or inverse-power transformations of empirical frequencies. In addition, taking the Pitman-Yor Chinese restaurant process as an adaptor justiﬁes the appearance of type frequencies in formal analyses of natural language and improves the performance of a model for unsupervised learning of morphology.

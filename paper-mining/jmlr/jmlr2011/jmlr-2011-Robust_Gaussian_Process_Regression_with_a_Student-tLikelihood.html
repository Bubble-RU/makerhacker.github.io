<p>Author: Botond Cseke, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of improving the Gaussian approximate posterior marginals computed by expectation propagation and the Laplace method in latent Gaussian models and propose methods that are similar in spirit to the Laplace approximation of Tierney and Kadane (1986). We show that in the case of sparse Gaussian models, the computational complexity of expectation propagation can be made comparable to that of the Laplace method by using a parallel updating scheme. In some cases, expectation propagation gives excellent estimates where the Laplace approximation fails. Inspired by bounds on the correct marginals, we arrive at factorized approximations, which can be applied on top of both expectation propagation and the Laplace method. The factorized approximations can give nearly indistinguishable results from the non-factorized approximations and their computational complexity scales linearly with the number of variables. We experienced that the expectation propagation based marginal approximations we introduce are typically more accurate than the methods of similar complexity proposed by Rue et al. (2009).

<p>Author: Timothee Cour, Ben Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of partially-labeled multiclass classiﬁcation, where instead of a single label per instance, the algorithm is given a candidate set of labels, only one of which is correct. Our setting is motivated by a common scenario in many image and video collections, where only partial access to labels is available. The goal is to learn a classiﬁer that can disambiguate the partiallylabeled training instances, and generalize to unseen data. We deﬁne an intuitive property of the data distribution that sharply characterizes the ability to learn in this setting and show that effective learning is possible even when all the data is only partially labeled. Exploiting this property of the data, we propose a convex learning formulation based on minimization of a loss function appropriate for the partial label setting. We analyze the conditions under which our loss function is asymptotically consistent, as well as its generalization and transductive performance. We apply our framework to identifying faces culled from web news sources and to naming characters in TV series and movies; in particular, we annotated and experimented on a very large video data set and achieve 6% error for character naming on 16 episodes of the TV series Lost.

<p>Author: Vincent Y.F. Tan, Animashree Anandkumar, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning forest-structured discrete graphical models from i.i.d. samples is considered. An algorithm based on pruning of the Chow-Liu tree through adaptive thresholding is proposed. It is shown that this algorithm is both structurally consistent and risk consistent and the error probability of structure learning decays faster than any polynomial in the number of samples under ﬁxed model size. For the high-dimensional scenario where the size of the model d and the number of edges k scale with the number of samples n, sufﬁcient conditions on (n, d, k) are given for the algorithm to satisfy structural and risk consistencies. In addition, the extremal structures for learning are identiﬁed; we prove that the independent (resp., tree) model is the hardest (resp., easiest) to learn using the proposed algorithm in terms of error rates for structure learning.

<p>Author: Özgür Sümer, Umut A. Acar, Alexander T. Ihler, Ramgopal R. Mettu</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms and applications involve repeatedly solving variations of the same inference problem, for example to introduce new evidence to the model or to change conditional dependencies. As the model is updated, the goal of adaptive inference is to take advantage of previously computed quantities to perform inference more rapidly than from scratch. In this paper, we present algorithms for adaptive exact inference on general graphs that can be used to efﬁciently compute marginals and update MAP conﬁgurations under arbitrary changes to the input factor graph and its associated elimination tree. After a linear time preprocessing step, our approach enables updates to the model and the computation of any marginal in time that is logarithmic in the size of the input model. Moreover, in contrast to max-product our approach can also be used to update MAP conﬁgurations in time that is roughly proportional to the number of updated entries, rather than the size of the input model. To evaluate the practical effectiveness of our algorithms, we implement and test them using synthetic data as well as for two real-world computational biology applications. Our experiments show that adaptive inference can achieve substantial speedups over performing complete inference as the model undergoes small changes over time.

<p>Author: Lauren A. Hannah, David M. Blei, Warren B. Powell</p><p>Abstract: We propose Dirichlet Process mixtures of Generalized Linear Models (DP-GLM), a new class of methods for nonparametric regression. Given a data set of input-response pairs, the DP-GLM produces a global model of the joint distribution through a mixture of local generalized linear models. DP-GLMs allow both continuous and categorical inputs, and can model the same class of responses that can be modeled with a generalized linear model. We study the properties of the DP-GLM, and show why it provides better predictions and density estimates than existing Dirichlet process mixture regression models. We give conditions for weak consistency of the joint distribution and pointwise consistency of the regression estimate.

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Guang Dai, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We propose a fully Bayesian methodology for generalized kernel mixed models (GKMMs), which are extensions of generalized linear mixed models in the feature space induced by a reproducing kernel. We place a mixture of a point-mass distribution and Silverman’s g-prior on the regression vector of a generalized kernel model (GKM). This mixture prior allows a fraction of the components of the regression vector to be zero. Thus, it serves for sparse modeling and is useful for Bayesian computation. In particular, we exploit data augmentation methodology to develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in which the reversible jump method is used for model selection and a Bayesian model averaging method is used for posterior prediction. When the feature basis expansion in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space is treated as a stochastic process, this approach can be related to the Karhunen-Lo` ve expansion of a Gaussian process (GP). Thus, our sparse e modeling framework leads to a ﬂexible approximation method for GPs.

<p>Author: Martijn R.K. Mes, Warren B. Powell, Peter I. Frazier</p><p>Abstract: We propose a sequential sampling policy for noisy discrete global optimization and ranking and selection, in which we aim to efﬁciently explore a ﬁnite set of alternatives before selecting an alternative as best when exploration stops. Each alternative may be characterized by a multidimensional vector of categorical and numerical attributes and has independent normal rewards. We use a Bayesian probability model for the unknown reward of each alternative and follow a fully sequential sampling policy called the knowledge-gradient policy. This policy myopically optimizes the expected increment in the value of sampling information in each time period. We propose a hierarchical aggregation technique that uses the common features shared by alternatives to learn about many alternatives from even a single measurement. This approach greatly reduces the measurement effort required, but it requires some prior knowledge on the smoothness of the function in the form of an aggregation function and computational issues limit the number of alternatives that can be easily considered to the thousands. We prove that our policy is consistent, ﬁnding a globally optimal alternative when given enough measurements, and show through simulations that it performs competitively with or signiﬁcantly better than other policies.

<p>Author: Özgür Sümer, Umut A. Acar, Alexander T. Ihler, Ramgopal R. Mettu</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms and applications involve repeatedly solving variations of the same inference problem, for example to introduce new evidence to the model or to change conditional dependencies. As the model is updated, the goal of adaptive inference is to take advantage of previously computed quantities to perform inference more rapidly than from scratch. In this paper, we present algorithms for adaptive exact inference on general graphs that can be used to efﬁciently compute marginals and update MAP conﬁgurations under arbitrary changes to the input factor graph and its associated elimination tree. After a linear time preprocessing step, our approach enables updates to the model and the computation of any marginal in time that is logarithmic in the size of the input model. Moreover, in contrast to max-product our approach can also be used to update MAP conﬁgurations in time that is roughly proportional to the number of updated entries, rather than the size of the input model. To evaluate the practical effectiveness of our algorithms, we implement and test them using synthetic data as well as for two real-world computational biology applications. Our experiments show that adaptive inference can achieve substantial speedups over performing complete inference as the model undergoes small changes over time.

<p>Author: Botond Cseke, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of improving the Gaussian approximate posterior marginals computed by expectation propagation and the Laplace method in latent Gaussian models and propose methods that are similar in spirit to the Laplace approximation of Tierney and Kadane (1986). We show that in the case of sparse Gaussian models, the computational complexity of expectation propagation can be made comparable to that of the Laplace method by using a parallel updating scheme. In some cases, expectation propagation gives excellent estimates where the Laplace approximation fails. Inspired by bounds on the correct marginals, we arrive at factorized approximations, which can be applied on top of both expectation propagation and the Laplace method. The factorized approximations can give nearly indistinguishable results from the non-factorized approximations and their computational complexity scales linearly with the number of variables. We experienced that the expectation propagation based marginal approximations we introduce are typically more accurate than the methods of similar complexity proposed by Rue et al. (2009).

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Guang Dai, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We propose a fully Bayesian methodology for generalized kernel mixed models (GKMMs), which are extensions of generalized linear mixed models in the feature space induced by a reproducing kernel. We place a mixture of a point-mass distribution and Silverman’s g-prior on the regression vector of a generalized kernel model (GKM). This mixture prior allows a fraction of the components of the regression vector to be zero. Thus, it serves for sparse modeling and is useful for Bayesian computation. In particular, we exploit data augmentation methodology to develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in which the reversible jump method is used for model selection and a Bayesian model averaging method is used for posterior prediction. When the feature basis expansion in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space is treated as a stochastic process, this approach can be related to the Karhunen-Lo` ve expansion of a Gaussian process (GP). Thus, our sparse e modeling framework leads to a ﬂexible approximation method for GPs.

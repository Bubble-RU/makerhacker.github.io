<h1>93 jmlr-2011-The arules R-Package Ecosystem: Analyzing Interesting Patterns from Large Transaction Data Sets</h1>

The packages provide comprehensive functionality for analyzing interesting patterns including frequent itemsets, association rules, frequent sequences and for building applications like associative classiﬁcation. After discussing the ecosystem’s design we illustrate the ease of mining and visualizing rules with a short example. Keywords: frequent itemsets, association rules, frequent sequences, visualization 1. Overview Mining frequent itemsets and association rules is a popular and well researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. Association rules are used in many applications and have become prominent as an important exploratory method for uncovering cross-selling opportunities in large retail databases. Agrawal et al. (1993) introduced the problem of mining association rules from transaction data as follows: Let I = {i1 , i2 , . . . , in } be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let D = {t1 ,t2 , . . . ,tm } be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I. A rule is deﬁned as an implication of the form X ⇒ Y where / X,Y ⊆ I and X ∩ Y = 0 are called itemsets. On itemsets and rules several quality measures can be deﬁned. The most important measures are support and conﬁdence. The support supp(X) of an itemset X is deﬁned as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the itemset. Itemsets with a support which surpasses a user deﬁned threshold σ are called frequent itemsets. The conﬁdence of a rule is deﬁned as conf(X ⇒ Y ) = supp(X ∪Y )/supp(X). Association rules are rules with supp(X ∪Y ) ≥ σ and conf(X) ≥ δ where σ and δ are user deﬁned thresholds. ©2011 Michael Hahsler, Sudheer Chelluboina, Kurt Hornik and Christian Buchta.

The R package arules (Hahsler et al., 2005, 2010) implements the basic infrastructure for creating and manipulating transaction databases and basic algorithms to efﬁciently ﬁnd and analyze association rules. Over the last ﬁve years several packages were built around the arules infrastructure to create the ecosystem shown in Figure 1. Compared to other tools, the arules ecosystem is fully integrated, implements the latest approaches and has the vast functionality of R for further analysis of found patterns at its disposal. 2. Design and Implementation The core package arules provides an object-oriented framework to represent transaction databases and patterns. To facilitate extensibility, patterns are implemented as an abstract superclass associations and then concrete subclasses implement individual types of patterns. In arules the associations itemsets and rules are provided. Databases and associations both use a sparse matrix representation for efﬁcient storage and basic operations like sorting, subsetting and matching are supported. Different aspects of arules were discussed in previous publications (Hahsler et al., 2005; Hahsler and Hornik, 2007b,a; Hahsler et al., 2008). In this paper we focus on the ecosystem of several R-packages which are built on top of the arules infrastructure. While arules provides Apriori and Eclat (implementations by Borgelt, 2003), two of the most important frequent itemset/association rule mining algorithms, additional algorithms can easily be added as new packages. For example, package arulesNBMiner (Hahsler, 2010) implements an algorithm to ﬁnd NB-frequent itemsets (Hahsler, 2006). A collection of further implementations which could be interfaced by arules in the future and a comparison of state-of-the-art algorithms can be found at the Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Repository.1 arulesSequences (Buchta and Hahsler, 2010) implements mining frequent sequences in transaction databases. It implements additional association classes called sequences and sequencerules and provides the algorithm cSpade (Zaki, 2001) to efﬁciently mine frequent sequences. Another application currently under development is arulesClassify which uses the arules infrastructure to implement rule-based classiﬁers, including Classiﬁcation Based on Association rules (CBA, Liu et al., 1998) and general associative classiﬁcation techniques (Jalali-Heravi and Zaïane, 2010). A known drawback of mining for frequent patterns such as association rules is that typically the algorithm returns a very large set of results where only a small fraction of patterns is of interest to the analysts.

<p>Author: Ryan N. Lichtenwalter, Nitesh V. Chawla</p><p>Abstract: LPmade is a complete cross-platform software solution for multi-core link prediction and related tasks and analysis. Its ﬁrst principal contribution is a scalable network library supporting highperformance implementations of the most commonly employed unsupervised link prediction methods. Link prediction in longitudinal data requires a sophisticated and disciplined procedure for correct results and fair evaluation, so the second principle contribution of LPmade is a sophisticated GNU make architecture that completely automates link prediction, prediction evaluation, and network analysis. Finally, LPmade streamlines and automates the procedure for creating multivariate supervised link prediction models with a version of WEKA modiﬁed to operate effectively on extremely large data sets. With mere minutes of manual work, one may start with a raw stream of records representing a network and progress through hundreds of steps to generate plots, gigabytes or terabytes of output, and actionable or publishable results.

<p>Author: Antti Ukkonen</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of clustering a set of chains to k clusters. A chain is a totally ordered subset of a ﬁnite set of items. Chains are an intuitive way to express preferences over a set of alternatives, as well as a useful representation of ratings in situations where the item-speciﬁc scores are either difﬁcult to obtain, too noisy due to measurement error, or simply not as relevant as the order that they induce over the items. First we adapt the classical k-means for chains by proposing a suitable distance function and a centroid structure. We also present two different approaches for mapping chains to a vector space. The ﬁrst one is related to the planted partition model, while the second one has an intuitive geometrical interpretation. Finally we discuss a randomization test for assessing the signiﬁcance of a clustering. To this end we present an MCMC algorithm for sampling random sets of chains that share certain properties with the original data. The methods are studied in a series of experiments using real and artiﬁcial data. Results indicate that the methods produce interesting clusterings, and for certain types of inputs improve upon previous work on clustering algorithms for orders.

<p>Author: Michael Hahsler, Sudheer Chelluboina, Kurt Hornik, Christian Buchta</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the ecosystem of R add-on packages developed around the infrastructure provided by the package arules. The packages provide comprehensive functionality for analyzing interesting patterns including frequent itemsets, association rules, frequent sequences and for building applications like associative classiﬁcation. After discussing the ecosystem’s design we illustrate the ease of mining and visualizing rules with a short example. Keywords: frequent itemsets, association rules, frequent sequences, visualization 1. Overview Mining frequent itemsets and association rules is a popular and well researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. Association rules are used in many applications and have become prominent as an important exploratory method for uncovering cross-selling opportunities in large retail databases. Agrawal et al. (1993) introduced the problem of mining association rules from transaction data as follows: Let I = {i1 , i2 , . . . , in } be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let D = {t1 ,t2 , . . . ,tm } be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I. A rule is deﬁned as an implication of the form X ⇒ Y where / X,Y ⊆ I and X ∩ Y = 0 are called itemsets. On itemsets and rules several quality measures can be deﬁned. The most important measures are support and conﬁdence. The support supp(X) of an itemset X is deﬁned as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the itemset. Itemsets with a support which surpasses a user deﬁned threshold σ are called frequent itemsets. The conﬁdence of a rule is deﬁned as conf(X ⇒ Y ) = supp(X ∪Y )/supp(X). Association rules are rules with supp(X ∪Y ) ≥ σ and conf(X) ≥ δ where σ and δ are user deﬁned thresholds. ©2011 Michael Hahsler, Sudheer Chelluboina, Kurt Hornik and Christian Buchta. H AHSLER , C HELLUBOINA , H ORNIK AND B UCHTA Figure 1: The arules ecosystem. The R package arules (Hahsler et al., 2005, 2010) implements the basic infrastructure for creating and manipulating transaction databases and basic algorithms to efﬁciently ﬁnd and analyze association rules. Over the last ﬁve years several packages were built around the arules infrastructure to create the ecosystem shown in Figure 1. Compared to other tools, the arules ecosystem is fully integrated, implements the latest approaches and has the vast functionality of R for further analysis of found patterns at its disposal. 2. Design and Implementation The core package arules provides an object-oriented framework to represent transaction databases and patterns. To facilitate extensibility, patterns are implemented as an abstract superclass associations and then concrete subclasses implement individual types of patterns. In arules the associations itemsets and rules are provided. Databases and associations both use a sparse matrix representation for efﬁcient storage and basic operations like sorting, subsetting and matching are supported. Different aspects of arules were discussed in previous publications (Hahsler et al., 2005; Hahsler and Hornik, 2007b,a; Hahsler et al., 2008). In this paper we focus on the ecosystem of several R-packages which are built on top of the arules infrastructure. While arules provides Apriori and Eclat (implementations by Borgelt, 2003), two of the most important frequent itemset/association rule mining algorithms, additional algorithms can easily be added as new packages. For example, package arulesNBMiner (Hahsler, 2010) implements an algorithm to ﬁnd NB-frequent itemsets (Hahsler, 2006). A collection of further implementations which could be interfaced by arules in the future and a comparison of state-of-the-art algorithms can be found at the Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Repository.1 arulesSequences (Buchta and Hahsler, 2010) implements mining frequent sequences in transaction databases. It implements additional association classes called sequences and sequencerules and provides the algorithm cSpade (Zaki, 2001) to efﬁciently mine frequent sequences. Another application currently under development is arulesClassify which uses the arules infrastructure to implement rule-based classiﬁers, including Classiﬁcation Based on Association rules (CBA, Liu et al., 1998) and general associative classiﬁcation techniques (Jalali-Heravi and Zaïane, 2010). A known drawback of mining for frequent patterns such as association rules is that typically the algorithm returns a very large set of results where only a small fraction of patterns is of interest to the analysts. Many researchers introduced visualization techniques including scatter plots, matrix 1. The Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Repository can be found at http://fimi.ua.ac.be/. 2022 T HE ARULES R-PACKAGE E COSYSTEM Graph for 3 rules Scatter plot for 410 rules 1 size: support (0.001 − 0.0019) color: lift (8.3404 − 11.2353) red/blush wine 10 citrus fruit soda 0.95 confidence liquor 8 bottled beer fruit/vegetable juice 0.9 other vegetables 6 root vegetables 0.85 oil 4 0.8 0.001 0.0015 0.002 0.0025 0.003 whole milk lift yogurt tropical fruit support (a) (b) Figure 2: Visualization of all 410 rules as (a) a scatter plot and (b) shows the top 3 rules according to lift as a graph. visualizations, graphs, mosaic plots and parallel coordinates plots to analyze large sets of association rules (see Bruzzese and Davino, 2008, for a recent overview paper). arulesViz (Hahsler and Chelluboina, 2010) implements most of these methods for arules while also providing improvements using color shading, reordering and interactive features. Finally, arules provides a Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) interface to import and export rules via package pmml (Williams et al., 2010). PMML is the leading standard for exchanging statistical and data mining models and is supported by all major solution providers. Although pmml provides interfaces for different packages it is still considered part of the arules ecosystem. The packages in the described ecosystem are available for Linux, OS X and Windows. All packages are distributed via the Comprehensive R Archive Network2 under GPL-2, along with comprehensive manuals, documentation, regression tests and source code. Development versions of most packages are available from R-Forge.3 3. User Interface We illustrate the user interface and the interaction between the packages in the arules ecosystem with a small example using a retail data set called Groceries which contains 9835 transactions with items aggregated to 169 categories. We mine association rules and then present the rules found as well as the top 3 rules according to the interest measure lift (deviation from independence) in two visualizations. > > > > library(</p><p>2 0.3693268 <a title="93-lsi-2" href="./jmlr-2011-Scikit-learn%3A_Machine_Learning_in_Python.html">83 jmlr-2011-Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python</a></p>

Association rules are rules with supp(X ∪Y ) ≥ σ and conf(X) ≥ δ where σ and δ are user deﬁned thresholds. ©2011 Michael Hahsler, Sudheer Chelluboina, Kurt Hornik and Christian Buchta. H AHSLER , C HELLUBOINA , H ORNIK AND B UCHTA Figure 1: The arules ecosystem. The R package arules (Hahsler et al., 2005, 2010) implements the basic infrastructure for creating and manipulating transaction databases and basic algorithms to efﬁciently ﬁnd and analyze association rules. Over the last ﬁve years several packages were built around the arules infrastructure to create the ecosystem shown in Figure 1. Compared to other tools, the arules ecosystem is fully integrated, implements the latest approaches and has the vast functionality of R for further analysis of found patterns at its disposal. 2. Design and Implementation The core package arules provides an object-oriented framework to represent transaction databases and patterns. To facilitate extensibility, patterns are implemented as an abstract superclass associations and then concrete subclasses implement individual types of patterns. In arules the associations itemsets and rules are provided. Databases and associations both use a sparse matrix representation for efﬁcient storage and basic operations like sorting, subsetting and matching are supported. Different aspects of arules were discussed in previous publications (Hahsler et al., 2005; Hahsler and Hornik, 2007b,a; Hahsler et al., 2008). In this paper we focus on the ecosystem of several R-packages which are built on top of the arules infrastructure. While arules provides Apriori and Eclat (implementations by Borgelt, 2003), two of the most important frequent itemset/association rule mining algorithms, additional algorithms can easily be added as new packages. For example, package arulesNBMiner (Hahsler, 2010) implements an algorithm to ﬁnd NB-frequent itemsets (Hahsler, 2006). A collection of further implementations which could be interfaced by arules in the future and a comparison of state-of-the-art algorithms can be found at the Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Repository.1 arulesSequences (Buchta and Hahsler, 2010) implements mining frequent sequences in transaction databases. It implements additional association classes called sequences and sequencerules and provides the algorithm cSpade (Zaki, 2001) to efﬁciently mine frequent sequences. Another application currently under development is arulesClassify which uses the arules infrastructure to implement rule-based classiﬁers, including Classiﬁcation Based on Association rules (CBA, Liu et al., 1998) and general associative classiﬁcation techniques (Jalali-Heravi and Zaïane, 2010). A known drawback of mining for frequent patterns such as association rules is that typically the algorithm returns a very large set of results where only a small fraction of patterns is of interest to the analysts. Many researchers introduced visualization techniques including scatter plots, matrix 1.

Finally, arules provides a Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) interface to import and export rules via package pmml (Williams et al., 2010). PMML is the leading standard for exchanging statistical and data mining models and is supported by all major solution providers. Although pmml provides interfaces for different packages it is still considered part of the arules ecosystem. The packages in the described ecosystem are available for Linux, OS X and Windows. All packages are distributed via the Comprehensive R Archive Network2 under GPL-2, along with comprehensive manuals, documentation, regression tests and source code. Development versions of most packages are available from R-Forge.3 3. User Interface We illustrate the user interface and the interaction between the packages in the arules ecosystem with a small example using a retail data set called Groceries which contains 9835 transactions with items aggregated to 169 categories. We mine association rules and then present the rules found as well as the top 3 rules according to the interest measure lift (deviation from independence) in two visualizations. > > > > library(</p><p>2 0.54029465 <a title="93-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2011-Logistic_Stick-Breaking_Process.html">61 jmlr-2011-Logistic Stick-Breaking Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Lu Ren, Lan Du, Lawrence Carin, David Dunson</p><p>Abstract: A logistic stick-breaking process (LSBP) is proposed for non-parametric clustering of general spatially- or temporally-dependent data, imposing the belief that proximate data are more likely to be clustered together. The sticks in the LSBP are realized via multiple logistic regression functions, with shrinkage priors employed to favor contiguous and spatially localized segments. The LSBP is also extended for the simultaneous processing of multiple data sets, yielding a hierarchical logistic stick-breaking process (H-LSBP). The model parameters (atoms) within the H-LSBP are shared across the multiple learning tasks. Efﬁcient variational Bayesian inference is derived, and comparisons are made to related techniques in the literature. Experimental analysis is performed for audio waveforms and images, and it is demonstrated that for segmentation applications the LSBP yields generally homogeneous segments with sharp boundaries.

<p>Author: Chiwoo Park, Jianhua Z. Huang, Yu Ding</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian process regression is a ﬂexible and powerful tool for machine learning, but the high computational complexity hinders its broader applications. In this paper, we propose a new approach for fast computation of Gaussian process regression with a focus on large spatial data sets. The approach decomposes the domain of a regression function into small subdomains and infers a local piece of the regression function for each subdomain. We explicitly address the mismatch problem of the local pieces on the boundaries of neighboring subdomains by imposing continuity constraints. The new approach has comparable or better computation complexity as other competing methods, but it is easier to be parallelized for faster computation. Moreover, the method can be adaptive to non-stationary features because of its local nature and, in particular, its use of different hyperparameters of the covariance function for different local regions. We illustrate application of the method and demonstrate its advantages over existing methods using two synthetic data sets and two real spatial data sets.

<p>Author: Alexandra M. Carvalho, Teemu Roos, Arlindo L. Oliveira, Petri Myllymäki</p><p>Abstract: We propose an efﬁcient and parameter-free scoring criterion, the factorized conditional log-likelihood (ˆ fCLL), for learning Bayesian network classiﬁers. The proposed score is an approximation of the conditional log-likelihood criterion. The approximation is devised in order to guarantee decomposability over the network structure, as well as efﬁcient estimation of the optimal parameters, achieving the same time and space complexity as the traditional log-likelihood scoring criterion. The resulting criterion has an information-theoretic interpretation based on interaction information, which exhibits its discriminative nature. To evaluate the performance of the proposed criterion, we present an empirical comparison with state-of-the-art classiﬁers. Results on a large suite of benchmark data sets from the UCI repository show that ˆ fCLL-trained classiﬁers achieve at least as good accuracy as the best compared classiﬁers, using signiﬁcantly less computational resources.

<p>Author: Liwei Wang, Masashi Sugiyama, Zhaoxiang Jing, Cheng Yang, Zhi-Hua Zhou, Jufu Feng</p><p>Abstract: Much attention has been paid to the theoretical explanation of the empirical success of AdaBoost. The most inﬂuential work is the margin theory, which is essentially an upper bound for the generalization error of any voting classiﬁer in terms of the margin distribution over the training data. However, important questions were raised about the margin explanation. Breiman (1999) proved a bound in terms of the minimum margin, which is sharper than the margin distribution bound. He argued that the minimum margin would be better in predicting the generalization error. Grove and Schuurmans (1998) developed an algorithm called LP-AdaBoost which maximizes the minimum margin while keeping all other factors the same as AdaBoost. In experiments however, LP-AdaBoost usually performs worse than AdaBoost, putting the margin explanation into serious doubt. In this paper, we make a reﬁned analysis of the margin theory. We prove a bound in terms of a new margin measure called the Equilibrium margin (Emargin). The Emargin bound is uniformly ©2011 Liwei Wang, Masashi Sugiyama, Zhaoxiang Jing, Cheng Yang, Zhi-Hua Zhou and Jufu Feng. WANG , S UGIYAMA , J ING , YANG , Z HOU AND F ENG sharper than Breiman’s minimum margin bound. Thus our result suggests that the minimum margin may be not crucial for the generalization error. We also show that a large Emargin and a small empirical error at Emargin imply a smaller bound of the generalization error. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate that AdaBoost usually has a larger Emargin and a smaller test error than LP-AdaBoost, which agrees well with our theory.

<p>Author: Myung Jin Choi, Vincent Y. F. Tan, Animashree Anandkumar, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a latent tree graphical model where samples are available only from a subset of variables. We propose two consistent and computationally efﬁcient algorithms for learning minimal latent trees, that is, trees without any redundant hidden nodes. Unlike many existing methods, the observed nodes (or variables) are not constrained to be leaf nodes. Our algorithms can be applied to both discrete and Gaussian random variables and our learned models are such that all the observed and latent variables have the same domain (state space). Our ﬁrst algorithm, recursive grouping, builds the latent tree recursively by identifying sibling groups using so-called information distances. One of the main contributions of this work is our second algorithm, which we refer to as CLGrouping. CLGrouping starts with a pre-processing procedure in which a tree over the observed variables is constructed. This global step groups the observed nodes that are likely to be close to each other in the true latent tree, thereby guiding subsequent recursive grouping (or equivalent procedures such as neighbor-joining) on much smaller subsets of variables. This results in more accurate and efﬁcient learning of latent trees. We also present regularized versions of our algorithms that learn latent tree approximations of arbitrary distributions. We compare the proposed algorithms to other methods by performing extensive numerical experiments on various latent tree graphical models such as hidden Markov models and star graphs. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of our methods on real-world data sets by modeling the dependency structure of monthly stock returns in the S&P; index and of the words in the 20 newsgroups data set.

<p>Author: Elias Zavitsanos, Georgios Paliouras, George A. Vouros</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents hHDP, a hierarchical algorithm for representing a document collection as a hierarchy of latent topics, based on Dirichlet process priors. The hierarchical nature of the algorithm refers to the Bayesian hierarchy that it comprises, as well as to the hierarchy of the latent topics. hHDP relies on nonparametric Bayesian priors and it is able to infer a hierarchy of topics, without making any assumption about the depth of the learned hierarchy and the branching factor at each level. We evaluate the proposed method on real-world data sets in document modeling, as well as in ontology learning, and provide qualitative and quantitative evaluation results, showing that the model is robust, it models accurately the training data set and is able to generalize on held-out data.

<p>Author: Rodolphe Jenatton, Julien Mairal, Guillaume Obozinski, Francis Bach</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding consists in representing signals as sparse linear combinations of atoms selected from a dictionary. We consider an extension of this framework where the atoms are further assumed to be embedded in a tree. This is achieved using a recently introduced tree-structured sparse regularization norm, which has proven useful in several applications. This norm leads to regularized problems that are difﬁcult to optimize, and in this paper, we propose efﬁcient algorithms for solving them. More precisely, we show that the proximal operator associated with this norm is computable exactly via a dual approach that can be viewed as the composition of elementary proximal operators. Our procedure has a complexity linear, or close to linear, in the number of atoms, and allows the use of accelerated gradient techniques to solve the tree-structured sparse approximation problem at the same computational cost as traditional ones using the ℓ1 -norm. Our method is efﬁcient and scales gracefully to millions of variables, which we illustrate in two types of applications: ﬁrst, we consider ﬁxed hierarchical dictionaries of wavelets to denoise natural images. Then, we apply our optimization tools in the context of dictionary learning, where learned dictionary elements naturally self-organize in a prespeciﬁed arborescent structure, leading to better performance in reconstruction of natural image patches. When applied to text documents, our method learns hierarchies of topics, thus providing a competitive alternative to probabilistic topic models.

<p>Author: Krishnakumar Balasubramanian, Pinar Donmez, Guy Lebanon</p><p>Abstract: Many popular linear classiﬁers, such as logistic regression, boosting, or SVM, are trained by optimizing a margin-based risk function. Traditionally, these risk functions are computed based on a labeled data set. We develop a novel technique for estimating such risks using only unlabeled data and the marginal label distribution. We prove that the proposed risk estimator is consistent on high-dimensional data sets and demonstrate it on synthetic and real-world data. In particular, we show how the estimate is used for evaluating classiﬁers in transfer learning, and for training classiﬁers with no labeled data whatsoever.

<p>Author: Philippe Rigollet, Xin Tong</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by problems of anomaly detection, this paper implements the Neyman-Pearson paradigm to deal with asymmetric errors in binary classiﬁcation with a convex loss ϕ. Given a ﬁnite collection of classiﬁers, we combine them and obtain a new classiﬁer that satisﬁes simultaneously the two following properties with high probability: (i) its ϕ-type I error is below a pre-speciﬁed level and (ii), it has ϕ-type II error close to the minimum possible. The proposed classiﬁer is obtained by minimizing an empirical convex objective with an empirical convex constraint. The novelty of the method is that the classiﬁer output by this computationally feasible program is shown to satisfy the original constraint on type I error. New techniques to handle such problems are developed and they have consequences on chance constrained programming. We also evaluate the price to pay in terms of type II error for being conservative on type I error.

This paper considers single-path or partial-path hierarchical classiﬁcation, where only one path is permitted from the root to a leaf node. A large margin method is introduced based on a new concept of generalized margins with respect to hierarchy. For implementation, we consider support vector machines and ψ-learning. Numerical and theoretical analyses suggest that the proposed method achieves the desired objective and compares favorably against strong competitors in the literature, including its ﬂat counterparts. Finally, an application to gene function prediction is discussed.

<p>Author: Rodolphe Jenatton, Julien Mairal, Guillaume Obozinski, Francis Bach</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding consists in representing signals as sparse linear combinations of atoms selected from a dictionary. We consider an extension of this framework where the atoms are further assumed to be embedded in a tree. This is achieved using a recently introduced tree-structured sparse regularization norm, which has proven useful in several applications. This norm leads to regularized problems that are difﬁcult to optimize, and in this paper, we propose efﬁcient algorithms for solving them. More precisely, we show that the proximal operator associated with this norm is computable exactly via a dual approach that can be viewed as the composition of elementary proximal operators. Our procedure has a complexity linear, or close to linear, in the number of atoms, and allows the use of accelerated gradient techniques to solve the tree-structured sparse approximation problem at the same computational cost as traditional ones using the ℓ1 -norm. Our method is efﬁcient and scales gracefully to millions of variables, which we illustrate in two types of applications: ﬁrst, we consider ﬁxed hierarchical dictionaries of wavelets to denoise natural images. Then, we apply our optimization tools in the context of dictionary learning, where learned dictionary elements naturally self-organize in a prespeciﬁed arborescent structure, leading to better performance in reconstruction of natural image patches. When applied to text documents, our method learns hierarchies of topics, thus providing a competitive alternative to probabilistic topic models.

<p>Author: Antti Ukkonen</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of clustering a set of chains to k clusters. A chain is a totally ordered subset of a ﬁnite set of items. Chains are an intuitive way to express preferences over a set of alternatives, as well as a useful representation of ratings in situations where the item-speciﬁc scores are either difﬁcult to obtain, too noisy due to measurement error, or simply not as relevant as the order that they induce over the items. First we adapt the classical k-means for chains by proposing a suitable distance function and a centroid structure. We also present two different approaches for mapping chains to a vector space. The ﬁrst one is related to the planted partition model, while the second one has an intuitive geometrical interpretation. Finally we discuss a randomization test for assessing the signiﬁcance of a clustering. To this end we present an MCMC algorithm for sampling random sets of chains that share certain properties with the original data. The methods are studied in a series of experiments using real and artiﬁcial data. Results indicate that the methods produce interesting clusterings, and for certain types of inputs improve upon previous work on clustering algorithms for orders.

<p>Author: Daniel Vainsencher, Shie Mannor, Alfred M. Bruckstein</p><p>Abstract: A large set of signals can sometimes be described sparsely using a dictionary, that is, every element can be represented as a linear combination of few elements from the dictionary. Algorithms for various signal processing applications, including classiﬁcation, denoising and signal separation, learn a dictionary from a given set of signals to be represented. Can we expect that the error in representing by such a dictionary a previously unseen signal from the same source will be of similar magnitude as those for the given examples? We assume signals are generated from a ﬁxed distribution, and study these questions from a statistical learning theory perspective. We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for two types of constraints on the coefﬁcient selection, as measured by the expected L2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case of l1 regularized coefﬁcient selection we provide a generalnp ln(mλ)/m , where n is the dimension, p is the number of ization bound of the order of O elements in the dictionary, λ is a bound on the l1 norm of the coefﬁcient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most k dictionary elements, we provide a bound of the order O( np ln(mk)/m) under an assumption on the closeness to orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense. Our results also include bounds that converge as 1/m, not previously known for this problem. We provide similar results in a general setting using kernels with weak smoothness requirements.

<p>Author: Aad van der Vaart, Harry van Zanten</p><p>Abstract: We consider the quality of learning a response function by a nonparametric Bayesian approach using a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the response function. We upper bound the quadratic risk of the learning procedure, which in turn is an upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler information between the predictive and true data distribution. The upper bound is expressed in small ball probabilities and concentration measures of the GP prior. We illustrate the computation of the upper bound for the Mat´ rn and squared exponential kernels. For these priors the risk, and hence the e information criterion, tends to zero for all continuous response functions. However, the rate at which this happens depends on the combination of true response function and Gaussian prior, and is expressible in a certain concentration function. In particular, the results show that for good performance, the regularity of the GP prior should match the regularity of the unknown response function.

<h1>56 jmlr-2011-Learning Transformation Models for Ranking and Survival Analysis</h1>

Suykens, Sabine Van Huffel</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the task of learning transformation models for ranking problems, ordinal regression and survival analysis. The present contribution describes a machine learning approach termed MINLIP . The key insight is to relate ranking criteria as the Area Under the Curve to monotone transformation functions.

<p>Author: Zeeshan Syed, John Guttag</p><p>Abstract: In medicine, one often bases decisions upon a comparative analysis of patient data. In this paper, we build upon this observation and describe similarity-based algorithms to risk stratify patients for major adverse cardiac events. We evolve the traditional approach of comparing patient data in two ways. First, we propose similarity-based algorithms that compare patients in terms of their long-term physiological monitoring data. Symbolic mismatch identiﬁes functional units in longterm signals and measures changes in the morphology and frequency of these units across patients. Second, we describe similarity-based algorithms that are unsupervised and do not require comparisons to patients with known outcomes for risk stratiﬁcation. This is achieved by using an anomaly detection framework to identify patients who are unlike other patients in a population and may potentially be at an elevated risk. We demonstrate the potential utility of our approach by showing how symbolic mismatch-based algorithms can be used to classify patients as being at high or low risk of major adverse cardiac events by comparing their long-term electrocardiograms to that of a large population. We describe how symbolic mismatch can be used in three different existing methods: one-class support vector machines, nearest neighbor analysis, and hierarchical clustering. When evaluated on a population of 686 patients with available long-term electrocardiographic data, symbolic mismatch-based comparative approaches were able to identify patients at roughly a two-fold increased risk of major adverse cardiac events in the 90 days following acute coronary syndrome. These results were consistent even after adjusting for other clinical risk variables.

<p>Author: Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: We describe and analyze two stochastic methods for ℓ1 regularized loss minimization problems, such as the Lasso. The ﬁrst method updates the weight of a single feature at each iteration while the second method updates the entire weight vector but only uses a single training example at each iteration. In both methods, the choice of feature or example is uniformly at random. Our theoretical runtime analysis suggests that the stochastic methods should outperform state-of-the-art deterministic approaches, including their deterministic counterparts, when the size of the problem is large. We demonstrate the advantage of stochastic methods by experimenting with synthetic and natural data sets.1 Keywords: L1 regularization, optimization, coordinate descent, mirror descent, sparsity</p><p>4 0.1068265 <a title="56-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2011-Super-Linear_Convergence_of_Dual_Augmented_Lagrangian_Algorithm_for_Sparsity_Regularized_Estimation.html">89 jmlr-2011-Super-Linear Convergence of Dual Augmented Lagrangian Algorithm for Sparsity Regularized Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryota Tomioka, Taiji Suzuki, Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: We analyze the convergence behaviour of a recently proposed algorithm for regularized estimation called Dual Augmented Lagrangian (DAL). Our analysis is based on a new interpretation of DAL as a proximal minimization algorithm. We theoretically show under some conditions that DAL converges super-linearly in a non-asymptotic and global sense. Due to a special modelling of sparse estimation problems in the context of machine learning, the assumptions we make are milder and more natural than those made in conventional analysis of augmented Lagrangian algorithms. In addition, the new interpretation enables us to generalize DAL to wide varieties of sparse estimation problems. We experimentally conﬁrm our analysis in a large scale ℓ1 -regularized logistic regression problem and extensively compare the efﬁciency of DAL algorithm to previously proposed algorithms on both synthetic and benchmark data sets.

<p>Author: Shipeng Yu, Balaji Krishnapuram, Rómer Rosales, R. Bharat Rao</p><p>Abstract: Co-training (or more generally, co-regularization) has been a popular algorithm for semi-supervised learning in data with two feature representations (or views), but the fundamental assumptions underlying this type of models are still unclear. In this paper we propose a Bayesian undirected graphical model for co-training, or more generally for semi-supervised multi-view learning. This makes explicit the previously unstated assumptions of a large class of co-training type algorithms, and also clariﬁes the circumstances under which these assumptions fail. Building upon new insights from this model, we propose an improved method for co-training, which is a novel co-training kernel for Gaussian process classiﬁers. The resulting approach is convex and avoids local-maxima problems, and it can also automatically estimate how much each view should be trusted to accommodate noisy or unreliable views. The Bayesian co-training approach can also elegantly handle data samples with missing views, that is, some of the views are not available for some data points at learning time. This is further extended to an active sensing framework, in which the missing (sample, view) pairs are actively acquired to improve learning performance. The strength of active sensing model is that one actively sensed (sample, view) pair would improve the joint multi-view classiﬁcation on all the samples. Experiments on toy data and several real world data sets illustrate the beneﬁts of this approach.

<p>Author: Vanya Van Belle, Kristiaan Pelckmans, Johan A. K. Suykens, Sabine Van Huffel</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the task of learning transformation models for ranking problems, ordinal regression and survival analysis. The present contribution describes a machine learning approach termed MINLIP . The key insight is to relate ranking criteria as the Area Under the Curve to monotone transformation functions. Consequently, the notion of a Lipschitz smoothness constant is found to be useful for complexity control for learning transformation models, much in a similar vein as the ’margin’ is for Support Vector Machines for classiﬁcation. The use of this model structure in the context of high dimensional data, as well as for estimating non-linear, and additive models based on primal-dual kernel machines, and for sparse models is indicated. Given n observations, the present method solves a quadratic program existing of O (n) constraints and O (n) unknowns, where most existing risk minimization approaches to ranking problems typically result in algorithms with O (n2 ) constraints or unknowns. We specify the MINLIP method for three different cases: the ﬁrst one concerns the preference learning problem. Secondly it is speciﬁed how to adapt the method to ordinal regression with a ﬁnite set of ordered outcomes. Finally, it is shown how the method can be used in the context of survival analysis where one models failure times, typically subject to censoring. The current approach is found to be particularly useful in this context as it can handle, in contrast with the standard statistical model for analyzing survival data, all types of censoring in a straightforward way, and because of the explicit relation with the Proportional Hazard and Accelerated Failure Time models. The advantage of the current method is illustrated on different benchmark data sets, as well as for estimating a model for cancer survival based on different micro-array and clinical data sets.

<p>Author: Kris De Brabanter, Jos De Brabanter, Johan A.K. Suykens, Bart De Moor</p><p>Abstract: It is a well-known problem that obtaining a correct bandwidth and/or smoothing parameter in nonparametric regression is difﬁcult in the presence of correlated errors. There exist a wide variety of methods coping with this problem, but they all critically depend on a tuning procedure which requires accurate information about the correlation structure. We propose a bandwidth selection procedure based on bimodal kernels which successfully removes the correlation without requiring any prior knowledge about its structure and its parameters. Further, we show that the form of the kernel is very important when errors are correlated which is in contrast to the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) case. Finally, some extensions are proposed to use the proposed criterion in support vector machines and least squares support vector machines for regression.

<p>Author: Sébastien Bubeck, Rémi Munos, Gilles Stoltz, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: We consider a generalization of stochastic bandits where the set of arms, X , is allowed to be a generic measurable space and the mean-payoff function is “locally Lipschitz” with respect to a dissimilarity function that is known to the decision maker. Under this condition we construct an arm selection policy, called HOO (hierarchical optimistic optimization), with improved regret bounds compared to previous results for a large class of problems. In particular, our results imply that if X is the unit hypercube in a Euclidean space and the mean-payoff function has a ﬁnite number of global maxima around which the behavior of the function is locally continuous with a known √ smoothness degree, then the expected regret of HOO is bounded up to a logarithmic factor by n, that is, the rate of growth of the regret is independent of the dimension of the space. We also prove the minimax optimality of our algorithm when the dissimilarity is a metric. Our basic strategy has quadratic computational complexity as a function of the number of time steps and does not rely on the doubling trick. We also introduce a modiﬁed strategy, which relies on the doubling trick but runs in linearithmic time. Both results are improvements with respect to previous approaches.

<p>Author: Shipeng Yu, Balaji Krishnapuram, Rómer Rosales, R. Bharat Rao</p><p>Abstract: Co-training (or more generally, co-regularization) has been a popular algorithm for semi-supervised learning in data with two feature representations (or views), but the fundamental assumptions underlying this type of models are still unclear. In this paper we propose a Bayesian undirected graphical model for co-training, or more generally for semi-supervised multi-view learning. This makes explicit the previously unstated assumptions of a large class of co-training type algorithms, and also clariﬁes the circumstances under which these assumptions fail. Building upon new insights from this model, we propose an improved method for co-training, which is a novel co-training kernel for Gaussian process classiﬁers. The resulting approach is convex and avoids local-maxima problems, and it can also automatically estimate how much each view should be trusted to accommodate noisy or unreliable views. The Bayesian co-training approach can also elegantly handle data samples with missing views, that is, some of the views are not available for some data points at learning time. This is further extended to an active sensing framework, in which the missing (sample, view) pairs are actively acquired to improve learning performance. The strength of active sensing model is that one actively sensed (sample, view) pair would improve the joint multi-view classiﬁcation on all the samples. Experiments on toy data and several real world data sets illustrate the beneﬁts of this approach.

<p>Author: Benoît Patra</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by the problem of effectively executing clustering algorithms on very large data sets, we address a model for large scale distributed clustering methods. To this end, we brieﬂy recall some standards on the quantization problem and some results on the almost sure convergence of the competitive learning vector quantization (CLVQ) procedure. A general model for linear distributed asynchronous algorithms well adapted to several parallel computing architectures is also discussed. Our approach brings together this scalable model and the CLVQ algorithm, and we call the resulting technique the distributed asynchronous learning vector quantization algorithm (DALVQ). An indepth analysis of the almost sure convergence of the DALVQ algorithm is performed. A striking result is that we prove that the multiple versions of the quantizers distributed among the processors in the parallel architecture asymptotically reach a consensus almost surely. Furthermore, we also show that these versions converge almost surely towards the same nearly optimal value for the quantization criterion.

<p>Author: Grigorios Tsoumakas, Eleftherios Spyromitros-Xioufis, Jozef Vilcek, Ioannis Vlahavas</p><p>Abstract: M ULAN is a Java library for learning from multi-label data. It offers a variety of classiﬁcation, ranking, thresholding and dimensionality reduction algorithms, as well as algorithms for learning from hierarchically structured labels. In addition, it contains an evaluation framework that calculates a rich variety of performance measures. Keywords: multi-label data, classiﬁcation, ranking, thresholding, dimensionality reduction, hierarchical classiﬁcation, evaluation 1. Multi-Label Learning A multi-label data set consists of training examples that are associated with a subset of a ﬁnite set of labels. Nowadays, multi-label data are becoming ubiquitous. They arise in an increasing number and diversity of applications, such as semantic annotation of images and video, web page categorization, direct marketing, functional genomics and music categorization into genres and emotions. There exist two major multi-label learning tasks (Tsoumakas et al., 2010): multi-label classiﬁcation and label ranking. The former is concerned with learning a model that outputs a bipartition of the set of labels into relevant and irrelevant with respect to a query instance. The latter is concerned with learning a model that outputs a ranking of the labels according to their relevance to a query instance. Some algorithms learn models that serve both tasks. Several algorithms learn models that primarily output a vector of numerical scores, one for each label. This vector is then converted to a ranking after solving ties, or to a bipartition, after thresholding (Ioannou et al., 2010). Multi-label learning methods addressing these tasks can be grouped into two categories (Tsoumakas et al., 2010): problem transformation and algorithm adaptation. The ﬁrst group of methods are algorithm independent. They transform the learning task into one or more singlelabel classiﬁcation tasks, for which a large body of learning algorithms exists. The second group of methods extend speciﬁc learning algorithms in order to handle multi-label data directly. There exist extensions of decision tree learners, nearest neighbor classiﬁers, neural networks, ensemble methods, support vector machines, kernel methods, genetic algorithms and others. Multi-label learning stretches across several other tasks. When labels are structured as a treeshaped hierarchy or a directed acyclic graph, then we have the interesting task of hierarchical multilabel learning. Dimensionality reduction is another important task for multi-label data, as it is for c 2011 Grigorios Tsoumakas, Eleftherios Spyromitros-Xiouﬁs, Jozef Vilcek and Ioannis Vlahavas. T SOUMAKAS , S PYROMITROS -X IOUFIS , V ILCEK AND V LAHAVAS any kind of data. When bags of instances are used to represent a training object, then multi-instance multi-label learning algorithms are required. There also exist semi-supervised learning and active learning algorithms for multi-label data. 2. The M ULAN Library The main goal of M ULAN is to bring the beneﬁts of machine learning open source software (MLOSS) (Sonnenburg et al., 2007) to people working with multi-label data. The availability of MLOSS is especially important in emerging areas like multi-label learning, because it removes the burden of implementing related work and speeds up the scientiﬁc progress. In multi-label learning, an extra burden is implementing appropriate evaluation measures, since these are different compared to traditional supervised learning tasks. Evaluating multi-label algorithms with a variety of measures, is considered important by the community, due to the different types of output (bipartition, ranking) and diverse applications. Towards this goal, M ULAN offers a plethora of state-of-the-art algorithms for multi-label classiﬁcation and label ranking and an evaluation framework that computes a large variety of multi-label evaluation measures through hold-out evaluation and cross-validation. In addition, the library offers a number of thresholding strategies that produce bipartitions from score vectors, simple baseline methods for multi-label dimensionality reduction and support for hierarchical multi-label classiﬁcation, including an implemented algorithm. M ULAN is a library. As such, it offers only programmatic API to the library users. There is no graphical user interface (GUI) available. The possibility to use the library via command line, is also currently not supported. Another drawback of M ULAN is that it runs everything in main memory so there exist limitations with very large data sets. M ULAN is written in Java and is built on top of Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005). This choice was made in order to take advantage of the vast resources of Weka on supervised learning algorithms, since many state-of-the-art multi-label learning algorithms are based on problem transformation. The fact that several machine learning researchers and practitioners are familiar with Weka was another reason for this choice. However, many aspects of the library are independent of Weka and there are interfaces for most of the core classes. M ULAN is an advocate of open science in general. One of the unique features of the library is a recently introduced experiments package, whose goal is to host code that reproduces experimental results reported on published papers on multi-label learning. To the best of our knowledge, most of the general learning platforms, like Weka, don’t support multi-label data. There are currently only a number of implementations of speciﬁc multi-label learning algorithms, but not a general library like M ULAN. 3. Using M ULAN This section presents an example of how to setup an experiment for empirically evaluating two multi-label algorithms on a multi-label data set using cross-validation. We create a new Java class for this experiment, which we call MulanExp1.java. The ﬁrst thing to do is load the multi-label data set that will be used for the empirical evaluation. M ULAN requires two text ﬁles for the speciﬁcation of a data set. The ﬁrst one is in the ARFF format of Weka. The labels should be speciﬁed as nominal attributes with values “0” and “1” indicating 2412 M ULAN : A JAVA L IBRARY FOR M ULTI -L ABEL L EARNING absence and presence of the label respectively. The second ﬁle is in XML format. It speciﬁes the labels and any hierarchical relationships among them. Hierarchies of labels can be expressed in the XML ﬁle by nesting the label tag. In our example, the two ﬁlenames are given to the experiment class through command-line parameters.

The packages provide comprehensive functionality for analyzing interesting patterns including frequent itemsets, association rules, frequent sequences and for building applications like associative classiﬁcation. After discussing the ecosystem’s design we illustrate the ease of mining and visualizing rules with a short example. Keywords: frequent itemsets, association rules, frequent sequences, visualization 1. Overview Mining frequent itemsets and association rules is a popular and well researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. Association rules are used in many applications and have become prominent as an important exploratory method for uncovering cross-selling opportunities in large retail databases. Agrawal et al. (1993) introduced the problem of mining association rules from transaction data as follows: Let I = {i1 , i2 , . . . , in } be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let D = {t1 ,t2 , . . . ,tm } be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I. A rule is deﬁned as an implication of the form X ⇒ Y where / X,Y ⊆ I and X ∩ Y = 0 are called itemsets. On itemsets and rules several quality measures can be deﬁned. The most important measures are support and conﬁdence. The support supp(X) of an itemset X is deﬁned as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the itemset. Itemsets with a support which surpasses a user deﬁned threshold σ are called frequent itemsets. The conﬁdence of a rule is deﬁned as conf(X ⇒ Y ) = supp(X ∪Y )/supp(X). Association rules are rules with supp(X ∪Y ) ≥ σ and conf(X) ≥ δ where σ and δ are user deﬁned thresholds. ©2011 Michael Hahsler, Sudheer Chelluboina, Kurt Hornik and Christian Buchta. H AHSLER , C HELLUBOINA , H ORNIK AND B UCHTA Figure 1: The arules ecosystem. The R package arules (Hahsler et al., 2005, 2010) implements the basic infrastructure for creating and manipulating transaction databases and basic algorithms to efﬁciently ﬁnd and analyze association rules. Over the last ﬁve years several packages were built around the arules infrastructure to create the ecosystem shown in Figure 1. Compared to other tools, the arules ecosystem is fully integrated, implements the latest approaches and has the vast functionality of R for further analysis of found patterns at its disposal. 2. Design and Implementation The core package arules provides an object-oriented framework to represent transaction databases and patterns. To facilitate extensibility, patterns are implemented as an abstract superclass associations and then concrete subclasses implement individual types of patterns. In arules the associations itemsets and rules are provided. Databases and associations both use a sparse matrix representation for efﬁcient storage and basic operations like sorting, subsetting and matching are supported. Different aspects of arules were discussed in previous publications (Hahsler et al., 2005; Hahsler and Hornik, 2007b,a; Hahsler et al., 2008). In this paper we focus on the ecosystem of several R-packages which are built on top of the arules infrastructure. While arules provides Apriori and Eclat (implementations by Borgelt, 2003), two of the most important frequent itemset/association rule mining algorithms, additional algorithms can easily be added as new packages. For example, package arulesNBMiner (Hahsler, 2010) implements an algorithm to ﬁnd NB-frequent itemsets (Hahsler, 2006). A collection of further implementations which could be interfaced by arules in the future and a comparison of state-of-the-art algorithms can be found at the Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Repository.1 arulesSequences (Buchta and Hahsler, 2010) implements mining frequent sequences in transaction databases. It implements additional association classes called sequences and sequencerules and provides the algorithm cSpade (Zaki, 2001) to efﬁciently mine frequent sequences. Another application currently under development is arulesClassify which uses the arules infrastructure to implement rule-based classiﬁers, including Classiﬁcation Based on Association rules (CBA, Liu et al., 1998) and general associative classiﬁcation techniques (Jalali-Heravi and Zaïane, 2010). A known drawback of mining for frequent patterns such as association rules is that typically the algorithm returns a very large set of results where only a small fraction of patterns is of interest to the analysts. Many researchers introduced visualization techniques including scatter plots, matrix 1.

Finally, arules provides a Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) interface to import and export rules via package pmml (Williams et al., 2010). PMML is the leading standard for exchanging statistical and data mining models and is supported by all major solution providers. Although pmml provides interfaces for different packages it is still considered part of the arules ecosystem. The packages in the described ecosystem are available for Linux, OS X and Windows. All packages are distributed via the Comprehensive R Archive Network2 under GPL-2, along with comprehensive manuals, documentation, regression tests and source code. Development versions of most packages are available from R-Forge.3 3. User Interface We illustrate the user interface and the interaction between the packages in the arules ecosystem with a small example using a retail data set called Groceries which contains 9835 transactions with items aggregated to 169 categories. We mine association rules and then present the rules found as well as the top 3 rules according to the interest measure lift (deviation from independence) in two visualizations. > > > > library(</p><p>4 0.032108139 <a title="62-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2011-Learning_a_Robust_Relevance_Model_for_Search_Using_Kernel_Methods.html">57 jmlr-2011-Learning a Robust Relevance Model for Search Using Kernel Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Wu, Jun Xu, Hang Li, Satoshi Oyama</p><p>Abstract: This paper points out that many search relevance models in information retrieval, such as the Vector Space Model, BM25 and Language Models for Information Retrieval, can be viewed as a similarity function between pairs of objects of different types, referred to as an S-function. An S-function is speciﬁcally deﬁned as the dot product between the images of two objects in a Hilbert space mapped from two different input spaces. One advantage of taking this view is that one can take a uniﬁed and principled approach to address the issues with regard to search relevance. The paper then proposes employing a kernel method to learn a robust relevance model as an S-function, which can effectively deal with the term mismatch problem, one of the biggest challenges in search. The kernel method exploits a positive semi-deﬁnite kernel referred to as an S-kernel. The paper shows that when using an S-kernel the model learned by the kernel method is guaranteed to be an S-function. The paper then gives more general principles for constructing S-kernels. A speciﬁc implementation of the kernel method is proposed using the Ranking SVM techniques and click-through data. The proposed approach is employed to learn a relevance model as an extension of BM25, referred to as Robust BM25. Experimental results on web search and enterprise search data show that Robust BM25 signiﬁcantly outperforms baseline methods and can successfully tackle the term mismatch problem.

In arules the associations itemsets and rules are provided. Databases and associations both use a sparse matrix representation for efﬁcient storage and basic operations like sorting, subsetting and matching are supported. Different aspects of arules were discussed in previous publications (Hahsler et al., 2005; Hahsler and Hornik, 2007b,a; Hahsler et al., 2008). In this paper we focus on the ecosystem of several R-packages which are built on top of the arules infrastructure. While arules provides Apriori and Eclat (implementations by Borgelt, 2003), two of the most important frequent itemset/association rule mining algorithms, additional algorithms can easily be added as new packages. For example, package arulesNBMiner (Hahsler, 2010) implements an algorithm to ﬁnd NB-frequent itemsets (Hahsler, 2006). A collection of further implementations which could be interfaced by arules in the future and a comparison of state-of-the-art algorithms can be found at the Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Repository.1 arulesSequences (Buchta and Hahsler, 2010) implements mining frequent sequences in transaction databases. It implements additional association classes called sequences and sequencerules and provides the algorithm cSpade (Zaki, 2001) to efﬁciently mine frequent sequences. Another application currently under development is arulesClassify which uses the arules infrastructure to implement rule-based classiﬁers, including Classiﬁcation Based on Association rules (CBA, Liu et al., 1998) and general associative classiﬁcation techniques (Jalali-Heravi and Zaïane, 2010). A known drawback of mining for frequent patterns such as association rules is that typically the algorithm returns a very large set of results where only a small fraction of patterns is of interest to the analysts. Many researchers introduced visualization techniques including scatter plots, matrix 1. The Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Repository can be found at http://fimi.ua.ac.be/. 2022 T HE ARULES R-PACKAGE E COSYSTEM Graph for 3 rules Scatter plot for 410 rules 1 size: support (0.001 − 0.0019) color: lift (8.3404 − 11.2353) red/blush wine 10 citrus fruit soda 0.95 confidence liquor 8 bottled beer fruit/vegetable juice 0.9 other vegetables 6 root vegetables 0.85 oil 4 0.8 0.001 0.0015 0.002 0.0025 0.003 whole milk lift yogurt tropical fruit support (a) (b) Figure 2: Visualization of all 410 rules as (a) a scatter plot and (b) shows the top 3 rules according to lift as a graph. visualizations, graphs, mosaic plots and parallel coordinates plots to analyze large sets of association rules (see Bruzzese and Davino, 2008, for a recent overview paper). arulesViz (Hahsler and Chelluboina, 2010) implements most of these methods for arules while also providing improvements using color shading, reordering and interactive features. Finally, arules provides a Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) interface to import and export rules via package pmml (Williams et al., 2010). PMML is the leading standard for exchanging statistical and data mining models and is supported by all major solution providers. Although pmml provides interfaces for different packages it is still considered part of the arules ecosystem. The packages in the described ecosystem are available for Linux, OS X and Windows. All packages are distributed via the Comprehensive R Archive Network2 under GPL-2, along with comprehensive manuals, documentation, regression tests and source code. Development versions of most packages are available from R-Forge.3 3. User Interface We illustrate the user interface and the interaction between the packages in the arules ecosystem with a small example using a retail data set called Groceries which contains 9835 transactions with items aggregated to 169 categories. We mine association rules and then present the rules found as well as the top 3 rules according to the interest measure lift (deviation from independence) in two visualizations. > > > > library(</p><p>3 0.26983067 <a title="62-lsi-3" href="./jmlr-2011-Bayesian_Generalized_Kernel_Mixed_Models.html">13 jmlr-2011-Bayesian Generalized Kernel Mixed Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Guang Dai, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We propose a fully Bayesian methodology for generalized kernel mixed models (GKMMs), which are extensions of generalized linear mixed models in the feature space induced by a reproducing kernel. We place a mixture of a point-mass distribution and Silverman’s g-prior on the regression vector of a generalized kernel model (GKM). This mixture prior allows a fraction of the components of the regression vector to be zero. Thus, it serves for sparse modeling and is useful for Bayesian computation. In particular, we exploit data augmentation methodology to develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in which the reversible jump method is used for model selection and a Bayesian model averaging method is used for posterior prediction. When the feature basis expansion in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space is treated as a stochastic process, this approach can be related to the Karhunen-Lo` ve expansion of a Gaussian process (GP). Thus, our sparse e modeling framework leads to a ﬂexible approximation method for GPs.

<p>Author: Shuheng Zhou, Philipp Rütimann, Min Xu, Peter Bühlmann</p><p>Abstract: Undirected graphs are often used to describe high dimensional distributions. Under sparsity conditions, the graph can be estimated using ℓ1 -penalization methods. We propose and study the following method. We combine a multiple regression approach with ideas of thresholding and reﬁtting: ﬁrst we infer a sparse undirected graphical model structure via thresholding of each among many ℓ1 -norm penalized regression functions; we then estimate the covariance matrix and its inverse using the maximum likelihood estimator. We show that under suitable conditions, this approach yields consistent estimation in terms of graphical structure and fast convergence rates with respect to the operator and Frobenius norm for the covariance matrix and its inverse. We also derive an explicit bound for the Kullback Leibler divergence.

<p>Author: Cassio P. de Campos, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning Bayesian network structures from data based on score functions that are decomposable. It describes properties that strongly reduce the time and memory costs of many known methods without losing global optimality guarantees. These properties are derived for different score criteria such as Minimum Description Length (or Bayesian Information Criterion), Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Dirichlet Criterion. Then a branch-andbound algorithm is presented that integrates structural constraints with data in a way to guarantee global optimality. As an example, structural constraints are used to map the problem of structure learning in Dynamic Bayesian networks into a corresponding augmented Bayesian network. Finally, we show empirically the beneﬁts of using the properties with state-of-the-art methods and with the new algorithm, which is able to handle larger data sets than before.

<p>Author: Jérémie Bigot, Rolando J. Biscay, Jean-Michel Loubes, Lillian Muñiz-Alvarez</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Group Lasso estimator of the covariance matrix of a stochastic process corrupted by an additive noise. We propose to estimate the covariance matrix in a highdimensional setting under the assumption that the process has a sparse representation in a large dictionary of basis functions. Using a matrix regression model, we propose a new methodology for high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation based on empirical contrast regularization by a group Lasso penalty. Using such a penalty, the method selects a sparse set of basis functions in the dictionary used to approximate the process, leading to an approximation of the covariance matrix into a low dimensional space. Consistency of the estimator is studied in Frobenius and operator norms and an application to sparse PCA is proposed.

<p>Author: Bharath K. Sriperumbudur, Kenji Fukumizu, Gert R.G. Lanckriet</p><p>Abstract: Over the last few years, two different notions of positive deﬁnite (pd) kernels—universal and characteristic—have been developing in parallel in machine learning: universal kernels are proposed in the context of achieving the Bayes risk by kernel-based classiﬁcation/regression algorithms while characteristic kernels are introduced in the context of distinguishing probability measures by embedding them into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, the relation between these two notions is not well understood. The main contribution of this paper is to clarify the relation between universal and characteristic kernels by presenting a unifying study relating them to RKHS embedding of measures, in addition to clarifying their relation to other common notions of strictly pd, conditionally strictly pd and integrally strictly pd kernels. For radial kernels on Rd , all these notions are shown to be equivalent.

<p>Author: Jonathan Aflalo, Aharon Ben-Tal, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Jagarlapudi Saketha Nath, Sankaran Raman</p><p>Abstract: paper1 This presents novel algorithms and applications for a particular class of mixed-norm regularization based Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) formulations. The formulations assume that the given kernels are grouped and employ l1 norm regularization for promoting sparsity within RKHS norms of each group and ls , s ≥ 2 norm regularization for promoting non-sparse combinations across groups. Various sparsity levels in combining the kernels can be achieved by varying the grouping of kernels—hence we name the formulations as Variable Sparsity Kernel Learning (VSKL) formulations. While previous attempts have a non-convex formulation, here we present a convex formulation which admits efﬁcient Mirror-Descent (MD) based solving techniques. The proposed MD based algorithm optimizes over product of simplices and has a computational complexity of O m2 ntot log nmax /ε2 where m is no. training data points, nmax , ntot are the maximum no. kernels in any group, total no. kernels respectively and ε is the error in approximating the objective. A detailed proof of convergence of the algorithm is also presented. Experimental results show that the VSKL formulations are well-suited for multi-modal learning tasks like object categorization. Results also show that the MD based algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art MKL solvers in terms of computational efﬁciency.

<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Ulf Brefeld, Sören Sonnenburg, Alexander Zien</p><p>Abstract: Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy when the right choice of features is unknown. Previous approaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability and scalability. Unfortunately, this ℓ1 -norm MKL is rarely observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures that generalize well, we extend MKL to arbitrary norms. We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efﬁcient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary norms, that is ℓ p -norms with p ≥ 1. This interleaved optimization is much faster than the commonly used wrapper approaches, as demonstrated on several data sets. A theoretical analysis and an experiment on controlled artiﬁcial data shed light on the appropriateness of sparse, non-sparse and ℓ∞ -norm MKL in various scenarios. Importantly, empirical applications of ℓ p -norm MKL to three real-world problems from computational biology show that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that surpass the state-of-the-art. Data sets, source code to reproduce the experiments, implementations of the algorithms, and further information are available at http://doc.ml.tu-berlin.de/nonsparse_mkl/.

<p>Author: Jinfeng Zhuang, Ivor W. Tsang, Steven C.H. Hoi</p><p>Abstract: Previous studies of Non-Parametric Kernel Learning (NPKL) usually formulate the learning task as a Semi-Deﬁnite Programming (SDP) problem that is often solved by some general purpose SDP solvers. However, for N data examples, the time complexity of NPKL using a standard interiorpoint SDP solver could be as high as O(N 6.5 ), which prohibits NPKL methods applicable to real applications, even for data sets of moderate size. In this paper, we present a family of efﬁcient NPKL algorithms, termed “SimpleNPKL”, which can learn non-parametric kernels from a large set of pairwise constraints efﬁciently. In particular, we propose two efﬁcient SimpleNPKL algorithms. One is SimpleNPKL algorithm with linear loss, which enjoys a closed-form solution that can be efﬁciently computed by the Lanczos sparse eigen decomposition technique. Another one is SimpleNPKL algorithm with other loss functions (including square hinge loss, hinge loss, square loss) that can be re-formulated as a saddle-point optimization problem, which can be further resolved by a fast iterative algorithm. In contrast to the previous NPKL approaches, our empirical results show that the proposed new technique, maintaining the same accuracy, is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient and scalable. Finally, we also demonstrate that the proposed new technique is also applicable to speed up many kernel learning tasks, including colored maximum variance unfolding, minimum volume embedding, and structure preserving embedding.

<p>Author: Nino Shervashidze, Pascal Schweitzer, Erik Jan van Leeuwen, Kurt Mehlhorn, Karsten M. Borgwardt</p><p>Abstract: In this article, we propose a family of efﬁcient kernels for large graphs with discrete node labels. Key to our method is a rapid feature extraction scheme based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman test of isomorphism on graphs. It maps the original graph to a sequence of graphs, whose node attributes capture topological and label information. A family of kernels can be deﬁned based on this Weisfeiler-Lehman sequence of graphs, including a highly efﬁcient kernel comparing subtree-like patterns. Its runtime scales only linearly in the number of edges of the graphs and the length of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph sequence. In our experimental evaluation, our kernels outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels on several graph classiﬁcation benchmark data sets in terms of accuracy and runtime. Our kernels open the door to large-scale applications of graph kernels in various disciplines such as computational biology and social network analysis.

<p>Author: Yoshinori Tamada, Seiya Imoto, Satoru Miyano</p><p>Abstract: We present a parallel algorithm for the score-based optimal structure search of Bayesian networks. This algorithm is based on a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm having O(n · 2n ) time and space complexity, which is known to be the fastest algorithm for the optimal structure search of networks with n nodes. The bottleneck of the problem is the memory requirement, and therefore, the algorithm is currently applicable for up to a few tens of nodes. While the recently proposed algorithm overcomes this limitation by a space-time trade-off, our proposed algorithm realizes direct parallelization of the original DP algorithm with O(nσ ) time and space overhead calculations, where σ > 0 controls the communication-space trade-off. The overall time and space complexity is O(nσ+1 2n ). This algorithm splits the search space so that the required communication between independent calculations is minimal. Because of this advantage, our algorithm can run on distributed memory supercomputers. Through computational experiments, we conﬁrmed that our algorithm can run in parallel using up to 256 processors with a parallelization efﬁciency of 0.74, compared to the original DP algorithm with a single processor. We also demonstrate optimal structure search for a 32-node network without any constraints, which is the largest network search presented in literature.

<p>Author: Brian McFee, Gert Lanckriet</p><p>Abstract: In many applications involving multi-media data, the deﬁnition of similarity between items is integral to several key tasks, including nearest-neighbor retrieval, classiﬁcation, and recommendation. Data in such regimes typically exhibits multiple modalities, such as acoustic and visual content of video. Integrating such heterogeneous data to form a holistic similarity space is therefore a key challenge to be overcome in many real-world applications. We present a novel multiple kernel learning technique for integrating heterogeneous data into a single, uniﬁed similarity space. Our algorithm learns an optimal ensemble of kernel transformations which conform to measurements of human perceptual similarity, as expressed by relative comparisons. To cope with the ubiquitous problems of subjectivity and inconsistency in multimedia similarity, we develop graph-based techniques to ﬁlter similarity measurements, resulting in a simpliﬁed and robust training procedure.

<p>Author: Bharath K. Sriperumbudur, Kenji Fukumizu, Gert R.G. Lanckriet</p><p>Abstract: Over the last few years, two different notions of positive deﬁnite (pd) kernels—universal and characteristic—have been developing in parallel in machine learning: universal kernels are proposed in the context of achieving the Bayes risk by kernel-based classiﬁcation/regression algorithms while characteristic kernels are introduced in the context of distinguishing probability measures by embedding them into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, the relation between these two notions is not well understood. The main contribution of this paper is to clarify the relation between universal and characteristic kernels by presenting a unifying study relating them to RKHS embedding of measures, in addition to clarifying their relation to other common notions of strictly pd, conditionally strictly pd and integrally strictly pd kernels. For radial kernels on Rd , all these notions are shown to be equivalent.

<p>Author: Jinfeng Zhuang, Ivor W. Tsang, Steven C.H. Hoi</p><p>Abstract: Previous studies of Non-Parametric Kernel Learning (NPKL) usually formulate the learning task as a Semi-Deﬁnite Programming (SDP) problem that is often solved by some general purpose SDP solvers. However, for N data examples, the time complexity of NPKL using a standard interiorpoint SDP solver could be as high as O(N 6.5 ), which prohibits NPKL methods applicable to real applications, even for data sets of moderate size. In this paper, we present a family of efﬁcient NPKL algorithms, termed “SimpleNPKL”, which can learn non-parametric kernels from a large set of pairwise constraints efﬁciently. In particular, we propose two efﬁcient SimpleNPKL algorithms. One is SimpleNPKL algorithm with linear loss, which enjoys a closed-form solution that can be efﬁciently computed by the Lanczos sparse eigen decomposition technique. Another one is SimpleNPKL algorithm with other loss functions (including square hinge loss, hinge loss, square loss) that can be re-formulated as a saddle-point optimization problem, which can be further resolved by a fast iterative algorithm. In contrast to the previous NPKL approaches, our empirical results show that the proposed new technique, maintaining the same accuracy, is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient and scalable. Finally, we also demonstrate that the proposed new technique is also applicable to speed up many kernel learning tasks, including colored maximum variance unfolding, minimum volume embedding, and structure preserving embedding.

<p>Author: Grégoire Montavon, Mikio L. Braun, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: When training deep networks it is common knowledge that an efﬁcient and well generalizing representation of the problem is formed. In this paper we aim to elucidate what makes the emerging representation successful. We analyze the layer-wise evolution of the representation in a deep network by building a sequence of deeper and deeper kernels that subsume the mapping performed by more and more layers of the deep network and measuring how these increasingly complex kernels ﬁt the learning problem. We observe that deep networks create increasingly better representations of the learning problem and that the structure of the deep network controls how fast the representation of the task is formed layer after layer.

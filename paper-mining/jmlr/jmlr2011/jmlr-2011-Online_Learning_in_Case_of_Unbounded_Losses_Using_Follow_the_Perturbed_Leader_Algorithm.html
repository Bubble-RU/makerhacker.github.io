<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Ohad Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We investigate three variants of budgeted learning, a setting in which the learner is allowed to access a limited number of attributes from training or test examples. In the “local budget” setting, where a constraint is imposed on the number of available attributes per training example, we design and analyze an efﬁcient algorithm for learning linear predictors that actively samples the attributes of each training instance. Our analysis bounds the number of additional examples sufﬁcient to compensate for the lack of full information on the training set. This result is complemented by a general lower bound for the easier “global budget” setting, where it is only the overall number of accessible training attributes that is being constrained. In the third, “prediction on a budget” setting, when the constraint is on the number of available attributes per test example, we show that there are cases in which there exists a linear predictor with zero error but it is statistically impossible to achieve arbitrary accuracy without full information on test examples. Finally, we run simple experiments on a digit recognition problem that reveal that our algorithm has a good performance against both partial information and full information baselines.

<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: The online multi-armed bandit problem and its generalizations are repeated decision making problems, where the goal is to select one of several possible decisions in every round, and incur a cost associated with the decision, in such a way that the total cost incurred over all iterations is close to the cost of the best ﬁxed decision in hindsight. The difference in these costs is known as the regret of the algorithm. The term bandit refers to the setting where one only obtains the cost of the decision used in a given iteration and no other information. A very general form of this problem is the non-stochastic bandit linear optimization problem, where the set of decisions is a convex set in some√ Euclidean space, and the cost functions are linear. ˜ Only recently an efﬁcient algorithm attaining O( T ) regret was discovered in this setting. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for the bandit linear optimization problem which √ ˜ obtains a tighter regret bound of O( Q), where Q is the total variation in the cost functions. This regret bound, previously conjectured to hold in the full information case, shows that it is possible to incur much less regret in a slowly changing environment even in the bandit setting. Our algorithm is efﬁcient and applies several new ideas to bandit optimization such as reservoir sampling.

<p>Author: Jaedeug Choi, Kee-Eung Kim</p><p>Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the problem of recovering the underlying reward function from the behavior of an expert. Most of the existing IRL algorithms assume that the environment is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), although it is desirable to handle partially observable settings in order to handle more realistic scenarios. In this paper, we present IRL algorithms for partially observable environments that can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We deal with two cases according to the representation of the given expert’s behavior, namely the case in which the expert’s policy is explicitly given, and the case in which the expert’s trajectories are available instead. The IRL in POMDPs poses a greater challenge than in MDPs since it is not only ill-posed due to the nature of IRL, but also computationally intractable due to the hardness in solving POMDPs. To overcome these obstacles, we present algorithms that exploit some of the classical results from the POMDP literature. Experimental results on several benchmark POMDP domains show that our work is useful for partially observable settings.

<p>Author: Tsuyoshi Ueno, Shin-ichi Maeda, Motoaki Kawanabe, Shin Ishii</p><p>Abstract: Since the invention of temporal difference (TD) learning (Sutton, 1988), many new algorithms for model-free policy evaluation have been proposed. Although they have brought much progress in practical applications of reinforcement learning (RL), there still remain fundamental problems concerning statistical properties of the value function estimation. To solve these problems, we introduce a new framework, semiparametric statistical inference, to model-free policy evaluation. This framework generalizes TD learning and its extensions, and allows us to investigate statistical properties of both of batch and online learning procedures for the value function estimation in a uniﬁed way in terms of estimating functions. Furthermore, based on this framework, we derive an optimal estimating function with the minimum asymptotic variance and propose batch and online learning algorithms which achieve the optimality.

<p>Author: Alexandra M. Carvalho, Teemu Roos, Arlindo L. Oliveira, Petri Myllymäki</p><p>Abstract: We propose an efﬁcient and parameter-free scoring criterion, the factorized conditional log-likelihood (ˆ fCLL), for learning Bayesian network classiﬁers. The proposed score is an approximation of the conditional log-likelihood criterion. The approximation is devised in order to guarantee decomposability over the network structure, as well as efﬁcient estimation of the optimal parameters, achieving the same time and space complexity as the traditional log-likelihood scoring criterion. The resulting criterion has an information-theoretic interpretation based on interaction information, which exhibits its discriminative nature. To evaluate the performance of the proposed criterion, we present an empirical comparison with state-of-the-art classiﬁers. Results on a large suite of benchmark data sets from the UCI repository show that ˆ fCLL-trained classiﬁers achieve at least as good accuracy as the best compared classiﬁers, using signiﬁcantly less computational resources.

<p>Author: Daniel Vainsencher, Shie Mannor, Alfred M. Bruckstein</p><p>Abstract: A large set of signals can sometimes be described sparsely using a dictionary, that is, every element can be represented as a linear combination of few elements from the dictionary. Algorithms for various signal processing applications, including classiﬁcation, denoising and signal separation, learn a dictionary from a given set of signals to be represented. Can we expect that the error in representing by such a dictionary a previously unseen signal from the same source will be of similar magnitude as those for the given examples? We assume signals are generated from a ﬁxed distribution, and study these questions from a statistical learning theory perspective. We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for two types of constraints on the coefﬁcient selection, as measured by the expected L2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case of l1 regularized coefﬁcient selection we provide a generalnp ln(mλ)/m , where n is the dimension, p is the number of ization bound of the order of O elements in the dictionary, λ is a bound on the l1 norm of the coefﬁcient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most k dictionary elements, we provide a bound of the order O( np ln(mk)/m) under an assumption on the closeness to orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense. Our results also include bounds that converge as 1/m, not previously known for this problem. We provide similar results in a general setting using kernels with weak smoothness requirements.

<p>Author: Bruno Pelletier, Pierre Pudlo</p><p>Abstract: Following Hartigan (1975), a cluster is deﬁned as a connected component of the t-level set of the underlying density, that is, the set of points for which the density is greater than t. A clustering algorithm which combines a density estimate with spectral clustering techniques is proposed. Our algorithm is composed of two steps. First, a nonparametric density estimate is used to extract the data points for which the estimated density takes a value greater than t. Next, the extracted points are clustered based on the eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian matrix. Under mild assumptions, we prove the almost sure convergence in operator norm of the empirical graph Laplacian operator associated with the algorithm. Furthermore, we give the typical behavior of the representation of the data set into the feature space, which establishes the strong consistency of our proposed algorithm.

<p>Author: Tsuyoshi Ueno, Shin-ichi Maeda, Motoaki Kawanabe, Shin Ishii</p><p>Abstract: Since the invention of temporal difference (TD) learning (Sutton, 1988), many new algorithms for model-free policy evaluation have been proposed. Although they have brought much progress in practical applications of reinforcement learning (RL), there still remain fundamental problems concerning statistical properties of the value function estimation. To solve these problems, we introduce a new framework, semiparametric statistical inference, to model-free policy evaluation. This framework generalizes TD learning and its extensions, and allows us to investigate statistical properties of both of batch and online learning procedures for the value function estimation in a uniﬁed way in terms of estimating functions. Furthermore, based on this framework, we derive an optimal estimating function with the minimum asymptotic variance and propose batch and online learning algorithms which achieve the optimality.

<p>Author: Aad van der Vaart, Harry van Zanten</p><p>Abstract: We consider the quality of learning a response function by a nonparametric Bayesian approach using a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the response function. We upper bound the quadratic risk of the learning procedure, which in turn is an upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler information between the predictive and true data distribution. The upper bound is expressed in small ball probabilities and concentration measures of the GP prior. We illustrate the computation of the upper bound for the Mat´ rn and squared exponential kernels. For these priors the risk, and hence the e information criterion, tends to zero for all continuous response functions. However, the rate at which this happens depends on the combination of true response function and Gaussian prior, and is expressible in a certain concentration function. In particular, the results show that for good performance, the regularity of the GP prior should match the regularity of the unknown response function.

<p>Author: Jérémie Bigot, Rolando J. Biscay, Jean-Michel Loubes, Lillian Muñiz-Alvarez</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Group Lasso estimator of the covariance matrix of a stochastic process corrupted by an additive noise. We propose to estimate the covariance matrix in a highdimensional setting under the assumption that the process has a sparse representation in a large dictionary of basis functions. Using a matrix regression model, we propose a new methodology for high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation based on empirical contrast regularization by a group Lasso penalty. Using such a penalty, the method selects a sparse set of basis functions in the dictionary used to approximate the process, leading to an approximation of the covariance matrix into a low dimensional space. Consistency of the estimator is studied in Frobenius and operator norms and an application to sparse PCA is proposed.

<p>Author: Chiwoo Park, Jianhua Z. Huang, Yu Ding</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian process regression is a ﬂexible and powerful tool for machine learning, but the high computational complexity hinders its broader applications. In this paper, we propose a new approach for fast computation of Gaussian process regression with a focus on large spatial data sets. The approach decomposes the domain of a regression function into small subdomains and infers a local piece of the regression function for each subdomain. We explicitly address the mismatch problem of the local pieces on the boundaries of neighboring subdomains by imposing continuity constraints. The new approach has comparable or better computation complexity as other competing methods, but it is easier to be parallelized for faster computation. Moreover, the method can be adaptive to non-stationary features because of its local nature and, in particular, its use of different hyperparameters of the covariance function for different local regions. We illustrate application of the method and demonstrate its advantages over existing methods using two synthetic data sets and two real spatial data sets.

<p>Author: Brian McFee, Gert Lanckriet</p><p>Abstract: In many applications involving multi-media data, the deﬁnition of similarity between items is integral to several key tasks, including nearest-neighbor retrieval, classiﬁcation, and recommendation. Data in such regimes typically exhibits multiple modalities, such as acoustic and visual content of video. Integrating such heterogeneous data to form a holistic similarity space is therefore a key challenge to be overcome in many real-world applications. We present a novel multiple kernel learning technique for integrating heterogeneous data into a single, uniﬁed similarity space. Our algorithm learns an optimal ensemble of kernel transformations which conform to measurements of human perceptual similarity, as expressed by relative comparisons. To cope with the ubiquitous problems of subjectivity and inconsistency in multimedia similarity, we develop graph-based techniques to ﬁlter similarity measurements, resulting in a simpliﬁed and robust training procedure.

<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Ulf Brefeld, Sören Sonnenburg, Alexander Zien</p><p>Abstract: Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy when the right choice of features is unknown. Previous approaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability and scalability. Unfortunately, this ℓ1 -norm MKL is rarely observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures that generalize well, we extend MKL to arbitrary norms. We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efﬁcient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary norms, that is ℓ p -norms with p ≥ 1. This interleaved optimization is much faster than the commonly used wrapper approaches, as demonstrated on several data sets. A theoretical analysis and an experiment on controlled artiﬁcial data shed light on the appropriateness of sparse, non-sparse and ℓ∞ -norm MKL in various scenarios. Importantly, empirical applications of ℓ p -norm MKL to three real-world problems from computational biology show that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that surpass the state-of-the-art. Data sets, source code to reproduce the experiments, implementations of the algorithms, and further information are available at http://doc.ml.tu-berlin.de/nonsparse_mkl/.

<p>Author: Mehmet Gönen, Ethem Alpaydın</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, several methods have been proposed to combine multiple kernels instead of using a single one. These different kernels may correspond to using different notions of similarity or may be using information coming from multiple sources (different representations or different feature subsets). In trying to organize and highlight the similarities and differences between them, we give a taxonomy of and review several multiple kernel learning algorithms. We perform experiments on real data sets for better illustration and comparison of existing algorithms. We see that though there may not be large differences in terms of accuracy, there is difference between them in complexity as given by the number of stored support vectors, the sparsity of the solution as given by the number of used kernels, and training time complexity. We see that overall, using multiple kernels instead of a single one is useful and believe that combining kernels in a nonlinear or data-dependent way seems more promising than linear combination in fusing information provided by simple linear kernels, whereas linear methods are more reasonable when combining complex Gaussian kernels.

<p>Author: Elias Zavitsanos, Georgios Paliouras, George A. Vouros</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents hHDP, a hierarchical algorithm for representing a document collection as a hierarchy of latent topics, based on Dirichlet process priors. The hierarchical nature of the algorithm refers to the Bayesian hierarchy that it comprises, as well as to the hierarchy of the latent topics. hHDP relies on nonparametric Bayesian priors and it is able to infer a hierarchy of topics, without making any assumption about the depth of the learned hierarchy and the branching factor at each level. We evaluate the proposed method on real-world data sets in document modeling, as well as in ontology learning, and provide qualitative and quantitative evaluation results, showing that the model is robust, it models accurately the training data set and is able to generalize on held-out data.

<p>Author: Şeyda Ertekin, Cynthia Rudin</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate that there are machine learning algorithms that can achieve success for two separate tasks simultaneously, namely the tasks of classiﬁcation and bipartite ranking. This means that advantages gained from solving one task can be carried over to the other task, such as the ability to obtain conditional density estimates, and an order-of-magnitude reduction in computational time for training the algorithm. It also means that some algorithms are robust to the choice of evaluation metric used; they can theoretically perform well when performance is measured either by a misclassiﬁcation error or by a statistic of the ROC curve (such as the area under the curve). Speciﬁcally, we provide such an equivalence relationship between a generalization of Freund et al.’s RankBoost algorithm, called the “P-Norm Push,” and a particular cost-sensitive classiﬁcation algorithm that generalizes AdaBoost, which we call “P-Classiﬁcation.” We discuss and validate the potential beneﬁts of this equivalence relationship, and perform controlled experiments to understand P-Classiﬁcation’s empirical performance. There is no established equivalence relationship for logistic regression and its ranking counterpart, so we introduce a logistic-regression-style algorithm that aims in between classiﬁcation and ranking, and has promising experimental performance with respect to both tasks.

<p>Author: Wei Wu, Jun Xu, Hang Li, Satoshi Oyama</p><p>Abstract: This paper points out that many search relevance models in information retrieval, such as the Vector Space Model, BM25 and Language Models for Information Retrieval, can be viewed as a similarity function between pairs of objects of different types, referred to as an S-function. An S-function is speciﬁcally deﬁned as the dot product between the images of two objects in a Hilbert space mapped from two different input spaces. One advantage of taking this view is that one can take a uniﬁed and principled approach to address the issues with regard to search relevance. The paper then proposes employing a kernel method to learn a robust relevance model as an S-function, which can effectively deal with the term mismatch problem, one of the biggest challenges in search. The kernel method exploits a positive semi-deﬁnite kernel referred to as an S-kernel. The paper shows that when using an S-kernel the model learned by the kernel method is guaranteed to be an S-function. The paper then gives more general principles for constructing S-kernels. A speciﬁc implementation of the kernel method is proposed using the Ranking SVM techniques and click-through data. The proposed approach is employed to learn a relevance model as an extension of BM25, referred to as Robust BM25. Experimental results on web search and enterprise search data show that Robust BM25 signiﬁcantly outperforms baseline methods and can successfully tackle the term mismatch problem.

<p>Author: Lu Ren, Lan Du, Lawrence Carin, David Dunson</p><p>Abstract: A logistic stick-breaking process (LSBP) is proposed for non-parametric clustering of general spatially- or temporally-dependent data, imposing the belief that proximate data are more likely to be clustered together. The sticks in the LSBP are realized via multiple logistic regression functions, with shrinkage priors employed to favor contiguous and spatially localized segments. The LSBP is also extended for the simultaneous processing of multiple data sets, yielding a hierarchical logistic stick-breaking process (H-LSBP). The model parameters (atoms) within the H-LSBP are shared across the multiple learning tasks. Efﬁcient variational Bayesian inference is derived, and comparisons are made to related techniques in the literature. Experimental analysis is performed for audio waveforms and images, and it is demonstrated that for segmentation applications the LSBP yields generally homogeneous segments with sharp boundaries.

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Ohad Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We investigate three variants of budgeted learning, a setting in which the learner is allowed to access a limited number of attributes from training or test examples. In the “local budget” setting, where a constraint is imposed on the number of available attributes per training example, we design and analyze an efﬁcient algorithm for learning linear predictors that actively samples the attributes of each training instance. Our analysis bounds the number of additional examples sufﬁcient to compensate for the lack of full information on the training set. This result is complemented by a general lower bound for the easier “global budget” setting, where it is only the overall number of accessible training attributes that is being constrained. In the third, “prediction on a budget” setting, when the constraint is on the number of available attributes per test example, we show that there are cases in which there exists a linear predictor with zero error but it is statistically impossible to achieve arbitrary accuracy without full information on test examples. Finally, we run simple experiments on a digit recognition problem that reveal that our algorithm has a good performance against both partial information and full information baselines.

<p>Author: Alexandra M. Carvalho, Teemu Roos, Arlindo L. Oliveira, Petri Myllymäki</p><p>Abstract: We propose an efﬁcient and parameter-free scoring criterion, the factorized conditional log-likelihood (ˆ fCLL), for learning Bayesian network classiﬁers. The proposed score is an approximation of the conditional log-likelihood criterion. The approximation is devised in order to guarantee decomposability over the network structure, as well as efﬁcient estimation of the optimal parameters, achieving the same time and space complexity as the traditional log-likelihood scoring criterion. The resulting criterion has an information-theoretic interpretation based on interaction information, which exhibits its discriminative nature. To evaluate the performance of the proposed criterion, we present an empirical comparison with state-of-the-art classiﬁers. Results on a large suite of benchmark data sets from the UCI repository show that ˆ fCLL-trained classiﬁers achieve at least as good accuracy as the best compared classiﬁers, using signiﬁcantly less computational resources.

<p>Author: David M. Blei, Peter I. Frazier</p><p>Abstract: We develop the distance dependent Chinese restaurant process, a ﬂexible class of distributions over partitions that allows for dependencies between the elements. This class can be used to model many kinds of dependencies between data in inﬁnite clustering models, including dependencies arising from time, space, and network connectivity. We examine the properties of the distance dependent CRP, discuss its connections to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models, and derive a Gibbs sampler for both fully observed and latent mixture settings. We study its empirical performance with three text corpora. We show that relaxing the assumption of exchangeability with distance dependent CRPs can provide a better ﬁt to sequential data and network data. We also show that the distance dependent CRP representation of the traditional CRP mixture leads to a faster-mixing Gibbs sampling algorithm than the one based on the original formulation.

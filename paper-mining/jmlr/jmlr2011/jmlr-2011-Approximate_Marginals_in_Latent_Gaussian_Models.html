<p>Author: Pasi Jylänki, Jarno Vanhatalo, Aki Vehtari</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the robust and efﬁcient implementation of Gaussian process regression with a Student-t observation model, which has a non-log-concave likelihood. The challenge with the Student-t model is the analytically intractable inference which is why several approximative methods have been proposed. Expectation propagation (EP) has been found to be a very accurate method in many empirical studies but the convergence of EP is known to be problematic with models containing non-log-concave site functions. In this paper we illustrate the situations where standard EP fails to converge and review different modiﬁcations and alternative algorithms for improving the convergence. We demonstrate that convergence problems may occur during the type-II maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the hyperparameters and show that standard EP may not converge in the MAP values with some difﬁcult data sets. We present a robust implementation which relies primarily on parallel EP updates and uses a moment-matching-based double-loop algorithm with adaptively selected step size in difﬁcult cases. The predictive performance of EP is compared with Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo approximations.

<p>Author: Timothee Cour, Ben Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of partially-labeled multiclass classiﬁcation, where instead of a single label per instance, the algorithm is given a candidate set of labels, only one of which is correct. Our setting is motivated by a common scenario in many image and video collections, where only partial access to labels is available. The goal is to learn a classiﬁer that can disambiguate the partiallylabeled training instances, and generalize to unseen data. We deﬁne an intuitive property of the data distribution that sharply characterizes the ability to learn in this setting and show that effective learning is possible even when all the data is only partially labeled. Exploiting this property of the data, we propose a convex learning formulation based on minimization of a loss function appropriate for the partial label setting. We analyze the conditions under which our loss function is asymptotically consistent, as well as its generalization and transductive performance. We apply our framework to identifying faces culled from web news sources and to naming characters in TV series and movies; in particular, we annotated and experimented on a very large video data set and achieve 6% error for character naming on 16 episodes of the TV series Lost.

<p>Author: Vincent Y.F. Tan, Animashree Anandkumar, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning forest-structured discrete graphical models from i.i.d. samples is considered. An algorithm based on pruning of the Chow-Liu tree through adaptive thresholding is proposed. It is shown that this algorithm is both structurally consistent and risk consistent and the error probability of structure learning decays faster than any polynomial in the number of samples under ﬁxed model size. For the high-dimensional scenario where the size of the model d and the number of edges k scale with the number of samples n, sufﬁcient conditions on (n, d, k) are given for the algorithm to satisfy structural and risk consistencies. In addition, the extremal structures for learning are identiﬁed; we prove that the independent (resp., tree) model is the hardest (resp., easiest) to learn using the proposed algorithm in terms of error rates for structure learning.

<p>Author: Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: We unify f -divergences, Bregman divergences, surrogate regret bounds, proper scoring rules, cost curves, ROC-curves and statistical information. We do this by systematically studying integral and variational representations of these objects and in so doing identify their representation primitives which all are related to cost-sensitive binary classiﬁcation. As well as developing relationships between generative and discriminative views of learning, the new machinery leads to tight and more general surrogate regret bounds and generalised Pinsker inequalities relating f -divergences to variational divergence. The new viewpoint also illuminates existing algorithms: it provides a new derivation of Support Vector Machines in terms of divergences and relates maximum mean discrepancy to Fisher linear discriminants.

<p>Author: Lars Omlor, Martin A. Giese</p><p>Abstract: Blind source separation problems emerge in many applications, where signals can be modeled as superpositions of multiple sources. Many popular applications of blind source separation are based on linear instantaneous mixture models. If speciﬁc invariance properties are known about the sources, for example, translation or rotation invariance, the simple linear model can be extended by inclusion of the corresponding transformations. When the sources are invariant against translations (spatial displacements or time shifts) the resulting model is called an anechoic mixing model. We present a new algorithmic framework for the solution of anechoic problems in arbitrary dimensions. This framework is derived from stochastic time-frequency analysis in general, and the marginal properties of the Wigner-Ville spectrum in particular. The method reduces the general anechoic problem to a set of anechoic problems with non-negativity constraints and a phase retrieval problem. The ﬁrst type of subproblem can be solved by existing algorithms, for example by an appropriate modiﬁcation of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). The second subproblem is solved by established phase retrieval methods. We discuss and compare implementations of this new algorithmic framework for several example problems with synthetic and real-world data, including music streams, natural 2D images, human motion trajectories and two-dimensional shapes.

Mettu</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms and applications involve repeatedly solving variations of the same inference problem, for example to introduce new evidence to the model or to change conditional dependencies. As the model is updated, the goal of adaptive inference is to take advantage of previously computed quantities to perform inference more rapidly than from scratch. In this paper, we present algorithms for adaptive exact inference on general graphs that can be used to efﬁciently compute marginals and update MAP conﬁgurations under arbitrary changes to the input factor graph and its associated elimination tree. After a linear time preprocessing step, our approach enables updates to the model and the computation of any marginal in time that is logarithmic in the size of the input model. Moreover, in contrast to max-product our approach can also be used to update MAP conﬁgurations in time that is roughly proportional to the number of updated entries, rather than the size of the input model. To evaluate the practical effectiveness of our algorithms, we implement and test them using synthetic data as well as for two real-world computational biology applications. Our experiments show that adaptive inference can achieve substantial speedups over performing complete inference as the model undergoes small changes over time.

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Guang Dai, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We propose a fully Bayesian methodology for generalized kernel mixed models (GKMMs), which are extensions of generalized linear mixed models in the feature space induced by a reproducing kernel. We place a mixture of a point-mass distribution and Silverman’s g-prior on the regression vector of a generalized kernel model (GKM). This mixture prior allows a fraction of the components of the regression vector to be zero. Thus, it serves for sparse modeling and is useful for Bayesian computation. In particular, we exploit data augmentation methodology to develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in which the reversible jump method is used for model selection and a Bayesian model averaging method is used for posterior prediction. When the feature basis expansion in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space is treated as a stochastic process, this approach can be related to the Karhunen-Lo` ve expansion of a Gaussian process (GP). Thus, our sparse e modeling framework leads to a ﬂexible approximation method for GPs.

<p>Author: Pasi Jylänki, Jarno Vanhatalo, Aki Vehtari</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the robust and efﬁcient implementation of Gaussian process regression with a Student-t observation model, which has a non-log-concave likelihood. The challenge with the Student-t model is the analytically intractable inference which is why several approximative methods have been proposed. Expectation propagation (EP) has been found to be a very accurate method in many empirical studies but the convergence of EP is known to be problematic with models containing non-log-concave site functions. In this paper we illustrate the situations where standard EP fails to converge and review different modiﬁcations and alternative algorithms for improving the convergence. We demonstrate that convergence problems may occur during the type-II maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the hyperparameters and show that standard EP may not converge in the MAP values with some difﬁcult data sets. We present a robust implementation which relies primarily on parallel EP updates and uses a moment-matching-based double-loop algorithm with adaptively selected step size in difﬁcult cases. The predictive performance of EP is compared with Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo approximations.

<p>Author: Julian J. McAuley, TibĂŠrio S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: Maximum A Posteriori inference in graphical models is often solved via message-passing algorithms, such as the junction-tree algorithm or loopy belief-propagation. The exact solution to this problem is well-known to be exponential in the size of the maximal cliques of the triangulated model, while approximate inference is typically exponential in the size of the modelĂ˘&euro;&trade;s factors. In this paper, we take advantage of the fact that many models have maximal cliques that are larger than their constituent factors, and also of the fact that many factors consist only of latent variables (i.e., they do not depend on an observation). This is a common case in a wide variety of applications that deal with grid-, tree-, and ring-structured models. In such cases, we are able to decrease the exponent of complexity for message-passing by 0.5 for both exact and approximate inference. We demonstrate that message-passing operations in such models are equivalent to some variant of matrix multiplication in the tropical semiring, for which we offer an O(N 2.5 ) expected-case solution.

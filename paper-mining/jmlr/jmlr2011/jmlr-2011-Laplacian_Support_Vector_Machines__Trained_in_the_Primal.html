<p>Author: Ryota Tomioka, Taiji Suzuki, Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: We analyze the convergence behaviour of a recently proposed algorithm for regularized estimation called Dual Augmented Lagrangian (DAL). Our analysis is based on a new interpretation of DAL as a proximal minimization algorithm. We theoretically show under some conditions that DAL converges super-linearly in a non-asymptotic and global sense. Due to a special modelling of sparse estimation problems in the context of machine learning, the assumptions we make are milder and more natural than those made in conventional analysis of augmented Lagrangian algorithms. In addition, the new interpretation enables us to generalize DAL to wide varieties of sparse estimation problems. We experimentally conﬁrm our analysis in a large scale ℓ1 -regularized logistic regression problem and extensively compare the efﬁciency of DAL algorithm to previously proposed algorithms on both synthetic and benchmark data sets.

<p>Author: Botond Cseke, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of improving the Gaussian approximate posterior marginals computed by expectation propagation and the Laplace method in latent Gaussian models and propose methods that are similar in spirit to the Laplace approximation of Tierney and Kadane (1986). We show that in the case of sparse Gaussian models, the computational complexity of expectation propagation can be made comparable to that of the Laplace method by using a parallel updating scheme. In some cases, expectation propagation gives excellent estimates where the Laplace approximation fails. Inspired by bounds on the correct marginals, we arrive at factorized approximations, which can be applied on top of both expectation propagation and the Laplace method. The factorized approximations can give nearly indistinguishable results from the non-factorized approximations and their computational complexity scales linearly with the number of variables. We experienced that the expectation propagation based marginal approximations we introduce are typically more accurate than the methods of similar complexity proposed by Rue et al. (2009).

<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Ulf Brefeld, Sören Sonnenburg, Alexander Zien</p><p>Abstract: Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy when the right choice of features is unknown. Previous approaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability and scalability. Unfortunately, this ℓ1 -norm MKL is rarely observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures that generalize well, we extend MKL to arbitrary norms. We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efﬁcient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary norms, that is ℓ p -norms with p ≥ 1. This interleaved optimization is much faster than the commonly used wrapper approaches, as demonstrated on several data sets. A theoretical analysis and an experiment on controlled artiﬁcial data shed light on the appropriateness of sparse, non-sparse and ℓ∞ -norm MKL in various scenarios. Importantly, empirical applications of ℓ p -norm MKL to three real-world problems from computational biology show that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that surpass the state-of-the-art. Data sets, source code to reproduce the experiments, implementations of the algorithms, and further information are available at http://doc.ml.tu-berlin.de/nonsparse_mkl/.

<p>Author: Krishnakumar Balasubramanian, Pinar Donmez, Guy Lebanon</p><p>Abstract: Many popular linear classiﬁers, such as logistic regression, boosting, or SVM, are trained by optimizing a margin-based risk function. Traditionally, these risk functions are computed based on a labeled data set. We develop a novel technique for estimating such risks using only unlabeled data and the marginal label distribution. We prove that the proposed risk estimator is consistent on high-dimensional data sets and demonstrate it on synthetic and real-world data. In particular, we show how the estimate is used for evaluating classiﬁers in transfer learning, and for training classiﬁers with no labeled data whatsoever.

<p>Author: Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: A multitask learning framework is developed for discriminative classiﬁcation and regression where multiple large-margin linear classiﬁers are estimated for different prediction problems. These classiﬁers operate in a common input space but are coupled as they recover an unknown shared representation. A maximum entropy discrimination (MED) framework is used to derive the multitask algorithm which involves only convex optimization problems that are straightforward to implement. Three multitask scenarios are described. The ﬁrst multitask method produces multiple support vector machines that learn a shared sparse feature selection over the input space. The second multitask method produces multiple support vector machines that learn a shared conic kernel combination. The third multitask method produces a pooled classiﬁer as well as adaptively specialized individual classiﬁers. Furthermore, extensions to regression, graphical model structure estimation and other sparse methods are discussed. The maximum entropy optimization problems are implemented via a sequential quadratic programming method which leverages recent progress in fast SVM solvers. Fast monotonic convergence bounds are provided by bounding the MED sparsifying cost function with a quadratic function and ensuring only a constant factor runtime increase above standard independent SVM solvers. Results are shown on multitask data sets and favor multitask learning over single-task or tabula rasa methods.

<p>Author: Shipeng Yu, Balaji Krishnapuram, Rómer Rosales, R. Bharat Rao</p><p>Abstract: Co-training (or more generally, co-regularization) has been a popular algorithm for semi-supervised learning in data with two feature representations (or views), but the fundamental assumptions underlying this type of models are still unclear. In this paper we propose a Bayesian undirected graphical model for co-training, or more generally for semi-supervised multi-view learning. This makes explicit the previously unstated assumptions of a large class of co-training type algorithms, and also clariﬁes the circumstances under which these assumptions fail. Building upon new insights from this model, we propose an improved method for co-training, which is a novel co-training kernel for Gaussian process classiﬁers. The resulting approach is convex and avoids local-maxima problems, and it can also automatically estimate how much each view should be trusted to accommodate noisy or unreliable views. The Bayesian co-training approach can also elegantly handle data samples with missing views, that is, some of the views are not available for some data points at learning time. This is further extended to an active sensing framework, in which the missing (sample, view) pairs are actively acquired to improve learning performance. The strength of active sensing model is that one actively sensed (sample, view) pair would improve the joint multi-view classiﬁcation on all the samples. Experiments on toy data and several real world data sets illustrate the beneﬁts of this approach.

<p>Author: Amarnag Subramanya, Jeff Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new objective for graph-based semi-supervised learning based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between discrete probability measures that encode class membership probabilities. We show how the proposed objective can be efﬁciently optimized using alternating minimization. We prove that the alternating minimization procedure converges to the correct optimum and derive a simple test for convergence. In addition, we show how this approach can be scaled to solve the semi-supervised learning problem on very large data sets, for example, in one instance we use a data set with over 108 samples. In this context, we propose a graph node ordering algorithm that is also applicable to other graph-based semi-supervised learning approaches. We compare the proposed approach against other standard semi-supervised learning algorithms on the semi-supervised learning benchmark data sets (Chapelle et al., 2007), and other real-world tasks such as text classiﬁcation on Reuters and WebKB, speech phone classiﬁcation on TIMIT and Switchboard, and linguistic dialog-act tagging on Dihana and Switchboard. In each case, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art. Lastly, we show that our objective can be generalized into a form that includes the standard squared-error loss, and we prove a geometric rate of convergence in that case.

<p>Author: Stefano Melacci, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: In the last few years, due to the growing ubiquity of unlabeled data, much effort has been spent by the machine learning community to develop better understanding and improve the quality of classiﬁers exploiting unlabeled data. Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVMs) have shown the state of the art performance in semi-supervised classiﬁcation. In this paper we present two strategies to solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the original dual formulation. In particular, training a LapSVM in the primal can be efﬁciently performed with preconditioned conjugate gradient. We speed up training by using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or, if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classiﬁcation accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. The computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced from O(n3 ) to O(kn2 ), where n is the combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples and k is empirically evaluated to be signiﬁcantly smaller than n. Due to its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for dealing with large data sets. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on real world data showing the beneﬁts of the proposed approach.

<p>Author: Jonathan Aflalo, Aharon Ben-Tal, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Jagarlapudi Saketha Nath, Sankaran Raman</p><p>Abstract: paper1 This presents novel algorithms and applications for a particular class of mixed-norm regularization based Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) formulations. The formulations assume that the given kernels are grouped and employ l1 norm regularization for promoting sparsity within RKHS norms of each group and ls , s ≥ 2 norm regularization for promoting non-sparse combinations across groups. Various sparsity levels in combining the kernels can be achieved by varying the grouping of kernels—hence we name the formulations as Variable Sparsity Kernel Learning (VSKL) formulations. While previous attempts have a non-convex formulation, here we present a convex formulation which admits efﬁcient Mirror-Descent (MD) based solving techniques. The proposed MD based algorithm optimizes over product of simplices and has a computational complexity of O m2 ntot log nmax /ε2 where m is no. training data points, nmax , ntot are the maximum no. kernels in any group, total no. kernels respectively and ε is the error in approximating the objective. A detailed proof of convergence of the algorithm is also presented. Experimental results show that the VSKL formulations are well-suited for multi-modal learning tasks like object categorization. Results also show that the MD based algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art MKL solvers in terms of computational efﬁciency.

<p>Author: John Duchi, Elad Hazan, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to ﬁnd needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efﬁcient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.

<p>Author: Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: A sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of discrete-valued observations is generated according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure) µ. After observing each outcome, one is required to give conditional probabilities of the next observation. The realizable case is when the measure µ belongs to an arbitrary but known class C of process measures. The non-realizable case is when µ is completely arbitrary, but the prediction performance is measured with respect to a given set C of process measures. We are interested in the relations between these problems and between their solutions, as well as in characterizing the cases when a solution exists and ﬁnding these solutions. We show that if the quality of prediction is measured using the total variation distance, then these problems coincide, while if it is measured using the expected average KL divergence, then they are different. For some of the formalizations we also show that when a solution exists it can be obtained as a Bayes mixture over a countable subset of C . We also obtain several characterization of those sets C for which solutions to the considered problems exist. As an illustration to the general results obtained, we show that a solution to the non-realizable case of the sequence prediction problem exists for the set of all ﬁnite-memory processes, but does not exist for the set of all stationary processes. It should be emphasized that the framework is completely general: the processes measures considered are not required to be i.i.d., mixing, stationary, or to belong to any parametric family.

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Ohad Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We investigate three variants of budgeted learning, a setting in which the learner is allowed to access a limited number of attributes from training or test examples. In the “local budget” setting, where a constraint is imposed on the number of available attributes per training example, we design and analyze an efﬁcient algorithm for learning linear predictors that actively samples the attributes of each training instance. Our analysis bounds the number of additional examples sufﬁcient to compensate for the lack of full information on the training set. This result is complemented by a general lower bound for the easier “global budget” setting, where it is only the overall number of accessible training attributes that is being constrained. In the third, “prediction on a budget” setting, when the constraint is on the number of available attributes per test example, we show that there are cases in which there exists a linear predictor with zero error but it is statistically impossible to achieve arbitrary accuracy without full information on test examples. Finally, we run simple experiments on a digit recognition problem that reveal that our algorithm has a good performance against both partial information and full information baselines.

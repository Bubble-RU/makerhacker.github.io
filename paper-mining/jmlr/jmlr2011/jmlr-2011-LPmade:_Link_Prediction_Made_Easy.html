<p>Author: Grigorios Tsoumakas, Eleftherios Spyromitros-Xioufis, Jozef Vilcek, Ioannis Vlahavas</p><p>Abstract: M ULAN is a Java library for learning from multi-label data. It offers a variety of classiﬁcation, ranking, thresholding and dimensionality reduction algorithms, as well as algorithms for learning from hierarchically structured labels. In addition, it contains an evaluation framework that calculates a rich variety of performance measures. Keywords: multi-label data, classiﬁcation, ranking, thresholding, dimensionality reduction, hierarchical classiﬁcation, evaluation 1. Multi-Label Learning A multi-label data set consists of training examples that are associated with a subset of a ﬁnite set of labels. Nowadays, multi-label data are becoming ubiquitous. They arise in an increasing number and diversity of applications, such as semantic annotation of images and video, web page categorization, direct marketing, functional genomics and music categorization into genres and emotions. There exist two major multi-label learning tasks (Tsoumakas et al., 2010): multi-label classiﬁcation and label ranking. The former is concerned with learning a model that outputs a bipartition of the set of labels into relevant and irrelevant with respect to a query instance. The latter is concerned with learning a model that outputs a ranking of the labels according to their relevance to a query instance. Some algorithms learn models that serve both tasks. Several algorithms learn models that primarily output a vector of numerical scores, one for each label. This vector is then converted to a ranking after solving ties, or to a bipartition, after thresholding (Ioannou et al., 2010). Multi-label learning methods addressing these tasks can be grouped into two categories (Tsoumakas et al., 2010): problem transformation and algorithm adaptation. The ﬁrst group of methods are algorithm independent. They transform the learning task into one or more singlelabel classiﬁcation tasks, for which a large body of learning algorithms exists. The second group of methods extend speciﬁc learning algorithms in order to handle multi-label data directly. There exist extensions of decision tree learners, nearest neighbor classiﬁers, neural networks, ensemble methods, support vector machines, kernel methods, genetic algorithms and others. Multi-label learning stretches across several other tasks. When labels are structured as a treeshaped hierarchy or a directed acyclic graph, then we have the interesting task of hierarchical multilabel learning. Dimensionality reduction is another important task for multi-label data, as it is for c 2011 Grigorios Tsoumakas, Eleftherios Spyromitros-Xiouﬁs, Jozef Vilcek and Ioannis Vlahavas. T SOUMAKAS , S PYROMITROS -X IOUFIS , V ILCEK AND V LAHAVAS any kind of data. When bags of instances are used to represent a training object, then multi-instance multi-label learning algorithms are required. There also exist semi-supervised learning and active learning algorithms for multi-label data. 2. The M ULAN Library The main goal of M ULAN is to bring the beneﬁts of machine learning open source software (MLOSS) (Sonnenburg et al., 2007) to people working with multi-label data. The availability of MLOSS is especially important in emerging areas like multi-label learning, because it removes the burden of implementing related work and speeds up the scientiﬁc progress. In multi-label learning, an extra burden is implementing appropriate evaluation measures, since these are different compared to traditional supervised learning tasks. Evaluating multi-label algorithms with a variety of measures, is considered important by the community, due to the different types of output (bipartition, ranking) and diverse applications. Towards this goal, M ULAN offers a plethora of state-of-the-art algorithms for multi-label classiﬁcation and label ranking and an evaluation framework that computes a large variety of multi-label evaluation measures through hold-out evaluation and cross-validation. In addition, the library offers a number of thresholding strategies that produce bipartitions from score vectors, simple baseline methods for multi-label dimensionality reduction and support for hierarchical multi-label classiﬁcation, including an implemented algorithm. M ULAN is a library. As such, it offers only programmatic API to the library users. There is no graphical user interface (GUI) available. The possibility to use the library via command line, is also currently not supported. Another drawback of M ULAN is that it runs everything in main memory so there exist limitations with very large data sets. M ULAN is written in Java and is built on top of Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005). This choice was made in order to take advantage of the vast resources of Weka on supervised learning algorithms, since many state-of-the-art multi-label learning algorithms are based on problem transformation. The fact that several machine learning researchers and practitioners are familiar with Weka was another reason for this choice. However, many aspects of the library are independent of Weka and there are interfaces for most of the core classes. M ULAN is an advocate of open science in general. One of the unique features of the library is a recently introduced experiments package, whose goal is to host code that reproduces experimental results reported on published papers on multi-label learning. To the best of our knowledge, most of the general learning platforms, like Weka, don’t support multi-label data. There are currently only a number of implementations of speciﬁc multi-label learning algorithms, but not a general library like M ULAN. 3. Using M ULAN This section presents an example of how to setup an experiment for empirically evaluating two multi-label algorithms on a multi-label data set using cross-validation. We create a new Java class for this experiment, which we call MulanExp1.java. The ﬁrst thing to do is load the multi-label data set that will be used for the empirical evaluation. M ULAN requires two text ﬁles for the speciﬁcation of a data set. The ﬁrst one is in the ARFF format of Weka. The labels should be speciﬁed as nominal attributes with values “0” and “1” indicating 2412 M ULAN : A JAVA L IBRARY FOR M ULTI -L ABEL L EARNING absence and presence of the label respectively. The second ﬁle is in XML format. It speciﬁes the labels and any hierarchical relationships among them. Hierarchies of labels can be expressed in the XML ﬁle by nesting the label tag.

<p>Author: Grégoire Montavon, Mikio L.

In this paper we aim to elucidate what makes the emerging representation successful. We analyze the layer-wise evolution of the representation in a deep network by building a sequence of deeper and deeper kernels that subsume the mapping performed by more and more layers of the deep network and measuring how these increasingly complex kernels ﬁt the learning problem. We observe that deep networks create increasingly better representations of the learning problem and that the structure of the deep network controls how fast the representation of the task is formed layer after layer.

<p>Author: Yoshinori Tamada, Seiya Imoto, Satoru Miyano</p><p>Abstract: We present a parallel algorithm for the score-based optimal structure search of Bayesian networks. This algorithm is based on a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm having O(n · 2n ) time and space complexity, which is known to be the fastest algorithm for the optimal structure search of networks with n nodes. The bottleneck of the problem is the memory requirement, and therefore, the algorithm is currently applicable for up to a few tens of nodes. While the recently proposed algorithm overcomes this limitation by a space-time trade-off, our proposed algorithm realizes direct parallelization of the original DP algorithm with O(nσ ) time and space overhead calculations, where σ > 0 controls the communication-space trade-off. The overall time and space complexity is O(nσ+1 2n ). This algorithm splits the search space so that the required communication between independent calculations is minimal. Because of this advantage, our algorithm can run on distributed memory supercomputers. Through computational experiments, we conﬁrmed that our algorithm can run in parallel using up to 256 processors with a parallelization efﬁciency of 0.74, compared to the original DP algorithm with a single processor. We also demonstrate optimal structure search for a 32-node network without any constraints, which is the largest network search presented in literature.

<p>Author: Timothee Cour, Ben Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of partially-labeled multiclass classiﬁcation, where instead of a single label per instance, the algorithm is given a candidate set of labels, only one of which is correct. Our setting is motivated by a common scenario in many image and video collections, where only partial access to labels is available. The goal is to learn a classiﬁer that can disambiguate the partiallylabeled training instances, and generalize to unseen data. We deﬁne an intuitive property of the data distribution that sharply characterizes the ability to learn in this setting and show that effective learning is possible even when all the data is only partially labeled. Exploiting this property of the data, we propose a convex learning formulation based on minimization of a loss function appropriate for the partial label setting. We analyze the conditions under which our loss function is asymptotically consistent, as well as its generalization and transductive performance. We apply our framework to identifying faces culled from web news sources and to naming characters in TV series and movies; in particular, we annotated and experimented on a very large video data set and achieve 6% error for character naming on 16 episodes of the TV series Lost.

<p>Author: Ryan N. Lichtenwalter, Nitesh V. Chawla</p><p>Abstract: LPmade is a complete cross-platform software solution for multi-core link prediction and related tasks and analysis. Its ﬁrst principal contribution is a scalable network library supporting highperformance implementations of the most commonly employed unsupervised link prediction methods. Link prediction in longitudinal data requires a sophisticated and disciplined procedure for correct results and fair evaluation, so the second principle contribution of LPmade is a sophisticated GNU make architecture that completely automates link prediction, prediction evaluation, and network analysis. Finally, LPmade streamlines and automates the procedure for creating multivariate supervised link prediction models with a version of WEKA modiﬁed to operate effectively on extremely large data sets. With mere minutes of manual work, one may start with a raw stream of records representing a network and progress through hundreds of steps to generate plots, gigabytes or terabytes of output, and actionable or publishable results.

<p>Author: Lars Omlor, Martin A. Giese</p><p>Abstract: Blind source separation problems emerge in many applications, where signals can be modeled as superpositions of multiple sources. Many popular applications of blind source separation are based on linear instantaneous mixture models. If speciﬁc invariance properties are known about the sources, for example, translation or rotation invariance, the simple linear model can be extended by inclusion of the corresponding transformations. When the sources are invariant against translations (spatial displacements or time shifts) the resulting model is called an anechoic mixing model. We present a new algorithmic framework for the solution of anechoic problems in arbitrary dimensions. This framework is derived from stochastic time-frequency analysis in general, and the marginal properties of the Wigner-Ville spectrum in particular. The method reduces the general anechoic problem to a set of anechoic problems with non-negativity constraints and a phase retrieval problem. The ﬁrst type of subproblem can be solved by existing algorithms, for example by an appropriate modiﬁcation of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). The second subproblem is solved by established phase retrieval methods. We discuss and compare implementations of this new algorithmic framework for several example problems with synthetic and real-world data, including music streams, natural 2D images, human motion trajectories and two-dimensional shapes.

<p>Author: Grigorios Tsoumakas, Eleftherios Spyromitros-Xioufis, Jozef Vilcek, Ioannis Vlahavas</p><p>Abstract: M ULAN is a Java library for learning from multi-label data. It offers a variety of classiﬁcation, ranking, thresholding and dimensionality reduction algorithms, as well as algorithms for learning from hierarchically structured labels. In addition, it contains an evaluation framework that calculates a rich variety of performance measures.

Multi-Label Learning A multi-label data set consists of training examples that are associated with a subset of a ﬁnite set of labels. Nowadays, multi-label data are becoming ubiquitous. They arise in an increasing number and diversity of applications, such as semantic annotation of images and video, web page categorization, direct marketing, functional genomics and music categorization into genres and emotions. There exist two major multi-label learning tasks (Tsoumakas et al., 2010): multi-label classiﬁcation and label ranking. The former is concerned with learning a model that outputs a bipartition of the set of labels into relevant and irrelevant with respect to a query instance. The latter is concerned with learning a model that outputs a ranking of the labels according to their relevance to a query instance. Some algorithms learn models that serve both tasks. Several algorithms learn models that primarily output a vector of numerical scores, one for each label. This vector is then converted to a ranking after solving ties, or to a bipartition, after thresholding (Ioannou et al., 2010). Multi-label learning methods addressing these tasks can be grouped into two categories (Tsoumakas et al., 2010): problem transformation and algorithm adaptation. The ﬁrst group of methods are algorithm independent. They transform the learning task into one or more singlelabel classiﬁcation tasks, for which a large body of learning algorithms exists. The second group of methods extend speciﬁc learning algorithms in order to handle multi-label data directly. There exist extensions of decision tree learners, nearest neighbor classiﬁers, neural networks, ensemble methods, support vector machines, kernel methods, genetic algorithms and others. Multi-label learning stretches across several other tasks. When labels are structured as a treeshaped hierarchy or a directed acyclic graph, then we have the interesting task of hierarchical multilabel learning. Dimensionality reduction is another important task for multi-label data, as it is for c 2011 Grigorios Tsoumakas, Eleftherios Spyromitros-Xiouﬁs, Jozef Vilcek and Ioannis Vlahavas.

When bags of instances are used to represent a training object, then multi-instance multi-label learning algorithms are required. There also exist semi-supervised learning and active learning algorithms for multi-label data. 2. The M ULAN Library The main goal of M ULAN is to bring the beneﬁts of machine learning open source software (MLOSS) (Sonnenburg et al., 2007) to people working with multi-label data. The availability of MLOSS is especially important in emerging areas like multi-label learning, because it removes the burden of implementing related work and speeds up the scientiﬁc progress. In multi-label learning, an extra burden is implementing appropriate evaluation measures, since these are different compared to traditional supervised learning tasks. Evaluating multi-label algorithms with a variety of measures, is considered important by the community, due to the different types of output (bipartition, ranking) and diverse applications. Towards this goal, M ULAN offers a plethora of state-of-the-art algorithms for multi-label classiﬁcation and label ranking and an evaluation framework that computes a large variety of multi-label evaluation measures through hold-out evaluation and cross-validation. In addition, the library offers a number of thresholding strategies that produce bipartitions from score vectors, simple baseline methods for multi-label dimensionality reduction and support for hierarchical multi-label classiﬁcation, including an implemented algorithm. M ULAN is a library. As such, it offers only programmatic API to the library users. There is no graphical user interface (GUI) available. The possibility to use the library via command line, is also currently not supported. Another drawback of M ULAN is that it runs everything in main memory so there exist limitations with very large data sets. M ULAN is written in Java and is built on top of Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005). This choice was made in order to take advantage of the vast resources of Weka on supervised learning algorithms, since many state-of-the-art multi-label learning algorithms are based on problem transformation. The fact that several machine learning researchers and practitioners are familiar with Weka was another reason for this choice. However, many aspects of the library are independent of Weka and there are interfaces for most of the core classes. M ULAN is an advocate of open science in general. One of the unique features of the library is a recently introduced experiments package, whose goal is to host code that reproduces experimental results reported on published papers on multi-label learning. To the best of our knowledge, most of the general learning platforms, like Weka, don’t support multi-label data. There are currently only a number of implementations of speciﬁc multi-label learning algorithms, but not a general library like M ULAN. 3. Using M ULAN This section presents an example of how to setup an experiment for empirically evaluating two multi-label algorithms on a multi-label data set using cross-validation. We create a new Java class for this experiment, which we call MulanExp1.java. The ﬁrst thing to do is load the multi-label data set that will be used for the empirical evaluation. M ULAN requires two text ﬁles for the speciﬁcation of a data set. The ﬁrst one is in the ARFF format of Weka. The labels should be speciﬁed as nominal attributes with values “0” and “1” indicating 2412 M ULAN : A JAVA L IBRARY FOR M ULTI -L ABEL L EARNING absence and presence of the label respectively. The second ﬁle is in XML format. It speciﬁes the labels and any hierarchical relationships among them. Hierarchies of labels can be expressed in the XML ﬁle by nesting the label tag. In our example, the two ﬁlenames are given to the experiment class through command-line parameters.

In this paper we aim to elucidate what makes the emerging representation successful. We analyze the layer-wise evolution of the representation in a deep network by building a sequence of deeper and deeper kernels that subsume the mapping performed by more and more layers of the deep network and measuring how these increasingly complex kernels ﬁt the learning problem. We observe that deep networks create increasingly better representations of the learning problem and that the structure of the deep network controls how fast the representation of the task is formed layer after layer.

<p>Author: Jinfeng Zhuang, Ivor W. Tsang, Steven C.H. Hoi</p><p>Abstract: Previous studies of Non-Parametric Kernel Learning (NPKL) usually formulate the learning task as a Semi-Deﬁnite Programming (SDP) problem that is often solved by some general purpose SDP solvers. However, for N data examples, the time complexity of NPKL using a standard interiorpoint SDP solver could be as high as O(N 6.5 ), which prohibits NPKL methods applicable to real applications, even for data sets of moderate size. In this paper, we present a family of efﬁcient NPKL algorithms, termed “SimpleNPKL”, which can learn non-parametric kernels from a large set of pairwise constraints efﬁciently. In particular, we propose two efﬁcient SimpleNPKL algorithms. One is SimpleNPKL algorithm with linear loss, which enjoys a closed-form solution that can be efﬁciently computed by the Lanczos sparse eigen decomposition technique. Another one is SimpleNPKL algorithm with other loss functions (including square hinge loss, hinge loss, square loss) that can be re-formulated as a saddle-point optimization problem, which can be further resolved by a fast iterative algorithm. In contrast to the previous NPKL approaches, our empirical results show that the proposed new technique, maintaining the same accuracy, is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient and scalable. Finally, we also demonstrate that the proposed new technique is also applicable to speed up many kernel learning tasks, including colored maximum variance unfolding, minimum volume embedding, and structure preserving embedding.

<p>Author: Jennifer Gillenwater, Kuzman Ganchev, João Graça, Fernando Pereira, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: A strong inductive bias is essential in unsupervised grammar induction. In this paper, we explore a particular sparsity bias in dependency grammars that encourages a small number of unique dependency types. We use part-of-speech (POS) tags to group dependencies by parent-child types and investigate sparsity-inducing penalties on the posterior distributions of parent-child POS tag pairs in the posterior regularization (PR) framework of Graça et al. (2007). In experiments with 12 different languages, we achieve signiﬁcant gains in directed attachment accuracy over the standard expectation maximization (EM) baseline, with an average accuracy improvement of 6.5%, outperforming EM by at least 1% for 9 out of 12 languages. Furthermore, the new method outperforms models based on standard Bayesian sparsity-inducing parameter priors with an average improvement of 5% and positive gains of at least 1% for 9 out of 12 languages. On English text in particular, we show that our approach improves performance over other state-of-the-art techniques.</p><p>3 0.11752494 <a title="68-tfidf-3" href="./jmlr-2011-Producing_Power-Law_Distributions_and_Damping_Word_Frequencies_with_Two-Stage_Language_Models.html">78 jmlr-2011-Producing Power-Law Distributions and Damping Word Frequencies with Two-Stage Language Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Sharon Goldwater, Thomas L. Griffiths, Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Standard statistical models of language fail to capture one of the most striking properties of natural languages: the power-law distribution in the frequencies of word tokens. We present a framework for developing statistical models that can generically produce power laws, breaking generative models into two stages. The ﬁrst stage, the generator, can be any standard probabilistic model, while the second stage, the adaptor, transforms the word frequencies of this model to provide a closer match to natural language. We show that two commonly used Bayesian models, the Dirichlet-multinomial model and the Dirichlet process, can be viewed as special cases of our framework. We discuss two stochastic processes—the Chinese restaurant process and its two-parameter generalization based on the Pitman-Yor process—that can be used as adaptors in our framework to produce power-law distributions over word frequencies. We show that these adaptors justify common estimation procedures based on logarithmic or inverse-power transformations of empirical frequencies. In addition, taking the Pitman-Yor Chinese restaurant process as an adaptor justiﬁes the appearance of type frequencies in formal analyses of natural language and improves the performance of a model for unsupervised learning of morphology.

<p>Author: Lucas Theis, Sebastian Gerwinn, Fabian Sinz, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: Statistical models of natural images provide an important tool for researchers in the ﬁelds of machine learning and computational neuroscience. The canonical measure to quantitatively assess and compare the performance of statistical models is given by the likelihood. One class of statistical models which has recently gained increasing popularity and has been applied to a variety of complex data is formed by deep belief networks. Analyses of these models, however, have often been limited to qualitative analyses based on samples due to the computationally intractable nature of their likelihood. Motivated by these circumstances, the present article introduces a consistent estimator for the likelihood of deep belief networks which is computationally tractable and simple to apply in practice. Using this estimator, we quantitatively investigate a deep belief network for natural image patches and compare its performance to the performance of other models for natural image patches. We ﬁnd that the deep belief network is outperformed with respect to the likelihood even by very simple mixture models.

<p>Author: Kamalika Chaudhuri, Claire Monteleoni, Anand D. Sarwate</p><p>Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms are crucial for the increasingly common setting in which personal data, such as medical or ﬁnancial records, are analyzed. We provide general techniques to produce privacy-preserving approximations of classiﬁers learned via (regularized) empirical risk minimization (ERM). These algorithms are private under the ε-differential privacy deﬁnition due to Dwork et al. (2006). First we apply the output perturbation ideas of Dwork et al. (2006), to ERM classiﬁcation. Then we propose a new method, objective perturbation, for privacy-preserving machine learning algorithm design. This method entails perturbing the objective function before optimizing over classiﬁers. If the loss and regularizer satisfy certain convexity and differentiability criteria, we prove theoretical results showing that our algorithms preserve privacy, and provide generalization bounds for linear and nonlinear kernels. We further present a privacypreserving technique for tuning the parameters in general machine learning algorithms, thereby providing end-to-end privacy guarantees for the training process. We apply these results to produce privacy-preserving analogues of regularized logistic regression and support vector machines. We obtain encouraging results from evaluating their performance on real demographic and benchmark data sets. Our results show that both theoretically and empirically, objective perturbation is superior to the previous state-of-the-art, output perturbation, in managing the inherent tradeoff between privacy and learning performance.

<p>Author: Jonathan Aflalo, Aharon Ben-Tal, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Jagarlapudi Saketha Nath, Sankaran Raman</p><p>Abstract: paper1 This presents novel algorithms and applications for a particular class of mixed-norm regularization based Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) formulations. The formulations assume that the given kernels are grouped and employ l1 norm regularization for promoting sparsity within RKHS norms of each group and ls , s ≥ 2 norm regularization for promoting non-sparse combinations across groups. Various sparsity levels in combining the kernels can be achieved by varying the grouping of kernels—hence we name the formulations as Variable Sparsity Kernel Learning (VSKL) formulations. While previous attempts have a non-convex formulation, here we present a convex formulation which admits efﬁcient Mirror-Descent (MD) based solving techniques. The proposed MD based algorithm optimizes over product of simplices and has a computational complexity of O m2 ntot log nmax /ε2 where m is no. training data points, nmax , ntot are the maximum no. kernels in any group, total no. kernels respectively and ε is the error in approximating the objective. A detailed proof of convergence of the algorithm is also presented. Experimental results show that the VSKL formulations are well-suited for multi-modal learning tasks like object categorization. Results also show that the MD based algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art MKL solvers in terms of computational efﬁciency. Keywords: multiple kernel learning, mirror descent, mixed-norm, object categorization, scalability 1. All authors contributed equally.

<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Ulf Brefeld, Sören Sonnenburg, Alexander Zien</p><p>Abstract: Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy when the right choice of features is unknown. Previous approaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability and scalability. Unfortunately, this ℓ1 -norm MKL is rarely observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures that generalize well, we extend MKL to arbitrary norms. We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efﬁcient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary norms, that is ℓ p -norms with p ≥ 1. This interleaved optimization is much faster than the commonly used wrapper approaches, as demonstrated on several data sets. A theoretical analysis and an experiment on controlled artiﬁcial data shed light on the appropriateness of sparse, non-sparse and ℓ∞ -norm MKL in various scenarios. Importantly, empirical applications of ℓ p -norm MKL to three real-world problems from computational biology show that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that surpass the state-of-the-art.

<p>Author: John Duchi, Elad Hazan, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to ﬁnd needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efﬁcient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.

<p>Author: Lauren A. Hannah, David M. Blei, Warren B. Powell</p><p>Abstract: We propose Dirichlet Process mixtures of Generalized Linear Models (DP-GLM), a new class of methods for nonparametric regression. Given a data set of input-response pairs, the DP-GLM produces a global model of the joint distribution through a mixture of local generalized linear models. DP-GLMs allow both continuous and categorical inputs, and can model the same class of responses that can be modeled with a generalized linear model. We study the properties of the DP-GLM, and show why it provides better predictions and density estimates than existing Dirichlet process mixture regression models. We give conditions for weak consistency of the joint distribution and pointwise consistency of the regression estimate.

<p>Author: Paramveer S. Dhillon, Dean Foster, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework MIC (Multiple Inclusion Criterion) for learning sparse models based on the information theoretic Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. MIC provides an elegant way of incorporating arbitrary sparsity patterns in the feature space by using two-part MDL coding schemes. We present MIC based models for the problems of grouped feature selection (MICG ROUP) and multi-task feature selection (MIC-M ULTI). MIC-G ROUP assumes that the features are divided into groups and induces two level sparsity, selecting a subset of the feature groups, and also selecting features within each selected group. MIC-M ULTI applies when there are multiple related tasks that share the same set of potentially predictive features. It also induces two level sparsity, selecting a subset of the features, and then selecting which of the tasks each feature should be added to. Lastly, we propose a model, T RANS F EAT, that can be used to transfer knowledge from a set of previously learned tasks to a new task that is expected to share similar features. All three methods are designed for selecting a small set of predictive features from a large pool of candidate features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with experimental results on data from genomics and from word sense disambiguation problems.1 Keywords: feature selection, minimum description length principle, multi-task learning</p><p>4 0.030632483 <a title="76-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2011-Information_Rates_of_Nonparametric_Gaussian_Process_Methods.html">44 jmlr-2011-Information Rates of Nonparametric Gaussian Process Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Aad van der Vaart, Harry van Zanten</p><p>Abstract: We consider the quality of learning a response function by a nonparametric Bayesian approach using a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the response function. We upper bound the quadratic risk of the learning procedure, which in turn is an upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler information between the predictive and true data distribution. The upper bound is expressed in small ball probabilities and concentration measures of the GP prior. We illustrate the computation of the upper bound for the Mat´ rn and squared exponential kernels. For these priors the risk, and hence the e information criterion, tends to zero for all continuous response functions. However, the rate at which this happens depends on the combination of true response function and Gaussian prior, and is expressible in a certain concentration function. In particular, the results show that for good performance, the regularity of the GP prior should match the regularity of the unknown response function.

<p>Author: Umut Ozertem, Deniz Erdogmus</p><p>Abstract: Principal curves are deﬁned as self-consistent smooth curves passing through the middle of the data, and they have been used in many applications of machine learning as a generalization, dimensionality reduction and a feature extraction tool. We redeﬁne principal curves and surfaces in terms of the gradient and the Hessian of the probability density estimate. This provides a geometric understanding of the principal curves and surfaces, as well as a unifying view for clustering, principal curve ﬁtting and manifold learning by regarding those as principal manifolds of different intrinsic dimensionalities. The theory does not impose any particular density estimation method can be used with any density estimator that gives continuous ﬁrst and second derivatives. Therefore, we ﬁrst present our principal curve/surface deﬁnition without assuming any particular density estimation method. Afterwards, we develop practical algorithms for the commonly used kernel density estimation (KDE) and Gaussian mixture models (GMM). Results of these algorithms are presented in notional data sets as well as real applications with comparisons to other approaches in the principal curve literature. All in all, we present a novel theoretical understanding of principal curves and surfaces, practical algorithms as general purpose machine learning tools, and applications of these algorithms to several practical problems.

We present some modiﬁcation of Kalai and Vempala algorithm of following the perturbed leader where weights depend on past losses of the experts. New notions of a volume and a scaled ﬂuctuation of a game are introduced. We present a probabilistic algorithm protected from unrestrictedly large one-step losses. This algorithm has the optimal performance in the case when the scaled ﬂuctuations of one-step losses of experts of the pool tend to zero.

<p>Author: Dorota Głowacka, John Shawe-Taylor, Alex Clark, Colin de la Higuera, Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Grammar induction refers to the process of learning grammars and languages from data; this ﬁnds a variety of applications in syntactic pattern recognition, the modeling of natural language acquisition, data mining and machine translation. This special topic contains several papers presenting some of recent developments in the area of grammar induction and language learning, as applied to various problems in Natural Language Processing, including supervised and unsupervised parsing and statistical machine translation.

<p>Author: Ashwin Srinivasan, Ganesh Ramakrishnan</p><p>Abstract: Reports of experiments conducted with an Inductive Logic Programming system rarely describe how speciﬁc values of parameters of the system are arrived at when constructing models. Usually, no attempt is made to identify sensitive parameters, and those that are used are often given “factory-supplied” default values, or values obtained from some non-systematic exploratory analysis. The immediate consequence of this is, of course, that it is not clear if better models could have been obtained if some form of parameter selection and optimisation had been performed. Questions follow inevitably on the experiments themselves: speciﬁcally, are all algorithms being treated fairly, and is the exploratory phase sufﬁciently well-deﬁned to allow the experiments to be replicated? In this paper, we investigate the use of parameter selection and optimisation techniques grouped under the study of experimental design. Screening and response surface methods determine, in turn, sensitive parameters and good values for these parameters. Screening is done here by constructing a stepwise regression model relating the utility of an ILP system’s hypothesis to its input parameters, using systematic combinations of values of input parameters (technically speaking, we use a two-level fractional factorial design of the input parameters). The parameters used by the regression model are taken to be the sensitive parameters for the system for that application. We then seek an assignment of values to these sensitive parameters that maximise the utility of the ILP model. This is done using the technique of constructing a local “response surface”. The parameters are then changed following the path of steepest ascent until a locally optimal value is reached. This combined use of parameter selection and response surface-driven optimisation has a long history of application in industrial engineering, and its role in ILP is demonstrated using well-known benchmarks. The results suggest that computational</p><p>3 0.32506427 <a title="76-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2011-Exploitation_of_Machine_Learning_Techniques_in_Modelling_Phrase_Movements_for_Machine_Translation.html">32 jmlr-2011-Exploitation of Machine Learning Techniques in Modelling Phrase Movements for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yizhao Ni, Craig Saunders, Sandor Szedmak, Mahesan Niranjan</p><p>Abstract: We propose a distance phrase reordering model (DPR) for statistical machine translation (SMT), where the aim is to learn the grammatical rules and context dependent changes using a phrase reordering classiﬁcation framework. We consider a variety of machine learning techniques, including state-of-the-art structured prediction methods. Techniques are compared and evaluated on a Chinese-English corpus, a language pair known for the high reordering characteristics which cannot be adequately captured with current models. In the reordering classiﬁcation task, the method signiﬁcantly outperforms the baseline against which it was tested, and further, when integrated as a component of the state-of-the-art machine translation system, MOSES, it achieves improvement in translation results.

<p>Author: Sharon Goldwater, Thomas L. Griffiths, Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Standard statistical models of language fail to capture one of the most striking properties of natural languages: the power-law distribution in the frequencies of word tokens. We present a framework for developing statistical models that can generically produce power laws, breaking generative models into two stages. The ﬁrst stage, the generator, can be any standard probabilistic model, while the second stage, the adaptor, transforms the word frequencies of this model to provide a closer match to natural language. We show that two commonly used Bayesian models, the Dirichlet-multinomial model and the Dirichlet process, can be viewed as special cases of our framework. We discuss two stochastic processes—the Chinese restaurant process and its two-parameter generalization based on the Pitman-Yor process—that can be used as adaptors in our framework to produce power-law distributions over word frequencies. We show that these adaptors justify common estimation procedures based on logarithmic or inverse-power transformations of empirical frequencies. In addition, taking the Pitman-Yor Chinese restaurant process as an adaptor justiﬁes the appearance of type frequencies in formal analyses of natural language and improves the performance of a model for unsupervised learning of morphology.

<p>Author: Ronan Collobert, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou, Michael Karlen, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Pavel Kuksa</p><p>Abstract: We propose a uniﬁed neural network architecture and learning algorithm that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-speciﬁc engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.

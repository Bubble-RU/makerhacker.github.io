<p>Author: Harm van Seijen, Shimon Whiteson, Hado van Hasselt, Marco Wiering</p><p>Abstract: This article presents and evaluates best-match learning, a new approach to reinforcement learning that trades off the sample efﬁciency of model-based methods with the space efﬁciency of modelfree methods. Best-match learning works by approximating the solution to a set of best-match equations, which combine a sparse model with a model-free Q-value function constructed from samples not used by the model. We prove that, unlike regular sparse model-based methods, bestmatch learning is guaranteed to converge to the optimal Q-values in the tabular case. Empirical results demonstrate that best-match learning can substantially outperform regular sparse modelbased methods, as well as several model-free methods that strive to improve the sample efﬁciency of temporal-difference methods. In addition, we demonstrate that best-match learning can be successfully combined with function approximation.

<p>Author: Jaedeug Choi, Kee-Eung Kim</p><p>Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the problem of recovering the underlying reward function from the behavior of an expert. Most of the existing IRL algorithms assume that the environment is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), although it is desirable to handle partially observable settings in order to handle more realistic scenarios. In this paper, we present IRL algorithms for partially observable environments that can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We deal with two cases according to the representation of the given expert’s behavior, namely the case in which the expert’s policy is explicitly given, and the case in which the expert’s trajectories are available instead. The IRL in POMDPs poses a greater challenge than in MDPs since it is not only ill-posed due to the nature of IRL, but also computationally intractable due to the hardness in solving POMDPs. To overcome these obstacles, we present algorithms that exploit some of the classical results from the POMDP literature. Experimental results on several benchmark POMDP domains show that our work is useful for partially observable settings.

<p>Author: Tsuyoshi Ueno, Shin-ichi Maeda, Motoaki Kawanabe, Shin Ishii</p><p>Abstract: Since the invention of temporal difference (TD) learning (Sutton, 1988), many new algorithms for model-free policy evaluation have been proposed. Although they have brought much progress in practical applications of reinforcement learning (RL), there still remain fundamental problems concerning statistical properties of the value function estimation. To solve these problems, we introduce a new framework, semiparametric statistical inference, to model-free policy evaluation. This framework generalizes TD learning and its extensions, and allows us to investigate statistical properties of both of batch and online learning procedures for the value function estimation in a uniﬁed way in terms of estimating functions. Furthermore, based on this framework, we derive an optimal estimating function with the minimum asymptotic variance and propose batch and online learning algorithms which achieve the optimality.

In this paper, we explore a particular sparsity bias in dependency grammars that encourages a small number of unique dependency types. We use part-of-speech (POS) tags to group dependencies by parent-child types and investigate sparsity-inducing penalties on the posterior distributions of parent-child POS tag pairs in the posterior regularization (PR) framework of Graça et al.

In experiments with 12 different languages, we achieve signiﬁcant gains in directed attachment accuracy over the standard expectation maximization (EM) baseline, with an average accuracy improvement of 6.5%, outperforming EM by at least 1% for 9 out of 12 languages. Furthermore, the new method outperforms models based on standard Bayesian sparsity-inducing parameter priors with an average improvement of 5% and positive gains of at least 1% for 9 out of 12 languages.

<p>Author: Peilin Zhao, Steven C.H. Hoi, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: In most kernel based online learning algorithms, when an incoming instance is misclassiﬁed, it will be added into the pool of support vectors and assigned with a weight, which often remains unchanged during the rest of the learning process. This is clearly insufﬁcient since when a new support vector is added, we generally expect the weights of the other existing support vectors to be updated in order to reﬂect the inﬂuence of the added support vector. In this paper, we propose a new online learning method, termed Double Updating Online Learning, or DUOL for short, that explicitly addresses this problem. Instead of only assigning a ﬁxed weight to the misclassiﬁed example received at the current trial, the proposed online learning algorithm also tries to update the weight for one of the existing support vectors. We show that the mistake bound can be improved by the proposed online learning method. We conduct an extensive set of empirical evaluations for both binary and multi-class online learning tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed technique is considerably more effective than the state-of-the-art online learning algorithms.

<p>Author: Stéphane Ross, Joelle Pineau, Brahim Chaib-draa, Pierre Kreitmann</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian learning methods have recently been shown to provide an elegant solution to the explorationexploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning. However most investigations of Bayesian reinforcement learning to date focus on the standard Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The primary focus of this paper is to extend these ideas to the case of partially observable domains, by introducing the Bayes-Adaptive Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes. This new framework can be used to simultaneously (1) learn a model of the POMDP domain through interaction with the environment, (2) track the state of the system under partial observability, and (3) plan (near-)optimal sequences of actions. An important contribution of this paper is to provide theoretical results showing how the model can be ﬁnitely approximated while preserving good learning performance. We present approximate algorithms for belief tracking and planning in this model, as well as empirical results that illustrate how the model estimate and agent’s return improve as a function of experience.

<p>Author: Timothee Cour, Ben Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of partially-labeled multiclass classiﬁcation, where instead of a single label per instance, the algorithm is given a candidate set of labels, only one of which is correct. Our setting is motivated by a common scenario in many image and video collections, where only partial access to labels is available. The goal is to learn a classiﬁer that can disambiguate the partiallylabeled training instances, and generalize to unseen data. We deﬁne an intuitive property of the data distribution that sharply characterizes the ability to learn in this setting and show that effective learning is possible even when all the data is only partially labeled. Exploiting this property of the data, we propose a convex learning formulation based on minimization of a loss function appropriate for the partial label setting. We analyze the conditions under which our loss function is asymptotically consistent, as well as its generalization and transductive performance. We apply our framework to identifying faces culled from web news sources and to naming characters in TV series and movies; in particular, we annotated and experimented on a very large video data set and achieve 6% error for character naming on 16 episodes of the TV series Lost.

<p>Author: Jaedeug Choi, Kee-Eung Kim</p><p>Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the problem of recovering the underlying reward function from the behavior of an expert. Most of the existing IRL algorithms assume that the environment is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), although it is desirable to handle partially observable settings in order to handle more realistic scenarios. In this paper, we present IRL algorithms for partially observable environments that can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We deal with two cases according to the representation of the given expert’s behavior, namely the case in which the expert’s policy is explicitly given, and the case in which the expert’s trajectories are available instead. The IRL in POMDPs poses a greater challenge than in MDPs since it is not only ill-posed due to the nature of IRL, but also computationally intractable due to the hardness in solving POMDPs. To overcome these obstacles, we present algorithms that exploit some of the classical results from the POMDP literature. Experimental results on several benchmark POMDP domains show that our work is useful for partially observable settings.

<p>Author: Harm van Seijen, Shimon Whiteson, Hado van Hasselt, Marco Wiering</p><p>Abstract: This article presents and evaluates best-match learning, a new approach to reinforcement learning that trades off the sample efﬁciency of model-based methods with the space efﬁciency of modelfree methods. Best-match learning works by approximating the solution to a set of best-match equations, which combine a sparse model with a model-free Q-value function constructed from samples not used by the model. We prove that, unlike regular sparse model-based methods, bestmatch learning is guaranteed to converge to the optimal Q-values in the tabular case. Empirical results demonstrate that best-match learning can substantially outperform regular sparse modelbased methods, as well as several model-free methods that strive to improve the sample efﬁciency of temporal-difference methods. In addition, we demonstrate that best-match learning can be successfully combined with function approximation.

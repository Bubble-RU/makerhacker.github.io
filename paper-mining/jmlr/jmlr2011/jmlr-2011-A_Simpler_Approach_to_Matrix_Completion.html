In this paper, we explore a particular sparsity bias in dependency grammars that encourages a small number of unique dependency types.

In experiments with 12 different languages, we achieve signiﬁcant gains in directed attachment accuracy over the standard expectation maximization (EM) baseline, with an average accuracy improvement of 6.5%, outperforming EM by at least 1% for 9 out of 12 languages. Furthermore, the new method outperforms models based on standard Bayesian sparsity-inducing parameter priors with an average improvement of 5% and positive gains of at least 1% for 9 out of 12 languages.

<p>Author: Jim C. Huang, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: We present a class of graphical models for directly representing the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) of many random variables, called cumulative distribution networks (CDNs). Unlike graphs for probability density and mass functions, for CDFs the marginal probabilities for any subset of variables are obtained by computing limits of functions in the model, and conditional probabilities correspond to computing mixed derivatives. We will show that the conditional independence properties in a CDN are distinct from the conditional independence properties of directed, undirected and factor graphs, but include the conditional independence properties of bi-directed graphs. In order to perform inference in such models, we describe the ‘derivative-sum-product’ (DSP) message-passing algorithm in which messages correspond to derivatives of the joint CDF. We will then apply CDNs to the problem of learning to rank players in multiplayer team-based games and suggest several future directions for research.

<p>Author: Gilles Meyer, Silvère Bonnabel, Rodolphe Sepulchre</p><p>Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of learning a regression model parameterized by a ﬁxed-rank positive semideﬁnite matrix. The focus is on the nonlinear nature of the search space and on scalability to high-dimensional problems. The mathematical developments rely on the theory of gradient descent algorithms adapted to the Riemannian geometry that underlies the set of ﬁxedrank positive semideﬁnite matrices. In contrast with previous contributions in the literature, no restrictions are imposed on the range space of the learned matrix. The resulting algorithms maintain a linear complexity in the problem size and enjoy important invariance properties. We apply the proposed algorithms to the problem of learning a distance function parameterized by a positive semideﬁnite matrix. Good performance is observed on classical benchmarks.

<p>Author: Şeyda Ertekin, Cynthia Rudin</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate that there are machine learning algorithms that can achieve success for two separate tasks simultaneously, namely the tasks of classiﬁcation and bipartite ranking. This means that advantages gained from solving one task can be carried over to the other task, such as the ability to obtain conditional density estimates, and an order-of-magnitude reduction in computational time for training the algorithm. It also means that some algorithms are robust to the choice of evaluation metric used; they can theoretically perform well when performance is measured either by a misclassiﬁcation error or by a statistic of the ROC curve (such as the area under the curve). Speciﬁcally, we provide such an equivalence relationship between a generalization of Freund et al.’s RankBoost algorithm, called the “P-Norm Push,” and a particular cost-sensitive classiﬁcation algorithm that generalizes AdaBoost, which we call “P-Classiﬁcation.” We discuss and validate the potential beneﬁts of this equivalence relationship, and perform controlled experiments to understand P-Classiﬁcation’s empirical performance. There is no established equivalence relationship for logistic regression and its ranking counterpart, so we introduce a logistic-regression-style algorithm that aims in between classiﬁcation and ranking, and has promising experimental performance with respect to both tasks.

<p>Author: Jinfeng Zhuang, Ivor W. Tsang, Steven C.H. Hoi</p><p>Abstract: Previous studies of Non-Parametric Kernel Learning (NPKL) usually formulate the learning task as a Semi-Deﬁnite Programming (SDP) problem that is often solved by some general purpose SDP solvers. However, for N data examples, the time complexity of NPKL using a standard interiorpoint SDP solver could be as high as O(N 6.5 ), which prohibits NPKL methods applicable to real applications, even for data sets of moderate size. In this paper, we present a family of efﬁcient NPKL algorithms, termed “SimpleNPKL”, which can learn non-parametric kernels from a large set of pairwise constraints efﬁciently. In particular, we propose two efﬁcient SimpleNPKL algorithms. One is SimpleNPKL algorithm with linear loss, which enjoys a closed-form solution that can be efﬁciently computed by the Lanczos sparse eigen decomposition technique. Another one is SimpleNPKL algorithm with other loss functions (including square hinge loss, hinge loss, square loss) that can be re-formulated as a saddle-point optimization problem, which can be further resolved by a fast iterative algorithm. In contrast to the previous NPKL approaches, our empirical results show that the proposed new technique, maintaining the same accuracy, is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient and scalable. Finally, we also demonstrate that the proposed new technique is also applicable to speed up many kernel learning tasks, including colored maximum variance unfolding, minimum volume embedding, and structure preserving embedding.

<p>Author: Benjamin Recht   </p><p>Abstract: This paper provides the best bounds to date on the number of randomly sampled entries required to reconstruct an unknown low-rank matrix. These results improve on prior work by Cand` s and e Recht (2009), Cand` s and Tao (2009), and Keshavan et al. (2009). The reconstruction is accome plished by minimizing the nuclear norm, or sum of the singular values, of the hidden matrix subject to agreement with the provided entries. If the underlying matrix satisﬁes a certain incoherence condition, then the number of entries required is equal to a quadratic logarithmic factor times the number of parameters in the singular value decomposition. The proof of this assertion is short, self contained, and uses very elementary analysis. The novel techniques herein are based on recent work in quantum information theory.

<p>Author: Tsuyoshi Ueno, Shin-ichi Maeda, Motoaki Kawanabe, Shin Ishii</p><p>Abstract: Since the invention of temporal difference (TD) learning (Sutton, 1988), many new algorithms for model-free policy evaluation have been proposed. Although they have brought much progress in practical applications of reinforcement learning (RL), there still remain fundamental problems concerning statistical properties of the value function estimation. To solve these problems, we introduce a new framework, semiparametric statistical inference, to model-free policy evaluation. This framework generalizes TD learning and its extensions, and allows us to investigate statistical properties of both of batch and online learning procedures for the value function estimation in a uniﬁed way in terms of estimating functions. Furthermore, based on this framework, we derive an optimal estimating function with the minimum asymptotic variance and propose batch and online learning algorithms which achieve the optimality.

<p>Author: Mehmet Gönen, Ethem Alpaydın</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, several methods have been proposed to combine multiple kernels instead of using a single one. These different kernels may correspond to using different notions of similarity or may be using information coming from multiple sources (different representations or different feature subsets). In trying to organize and highlight the similarities and differences between them, we give a taxonomy of and review several multiple kernel learning algorithms. We perform experiments on real data sets for better illustration and comparison of existing algorithms. We see that though there may not be large differences in terms of accuracy, there is difference between them in complexity as given by the number of stored support vectors, the sparsity of the solution as given by the number of used kernels, and training time complexity. We see that overall, using multiple kernels instead of a single one is useful and believe that combining kernels in a nonlinear or data-dependent way seems more promising than linear combination in fusing information provided by simple linear kernels, whereas linear methods are more reasonable when combining complex Gaussian kernels.

<p>Author: Gilles Meyer, Silvère Bonnabel, Rodolphe Sepulchre</p><p>Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of learning a regression model parameterized by a ﬁxed-rank positive semideﬁnite matrix. The focus is on the nonlinear nature of the search space and on scalability to high-dimensional problems. The mathematical developments rely on the theory of gradient descent algorithms adapted to the Riemannian geometry that underlies the set of ﬁxedrank positive semideﬁnite matrices. In contrast with previous contributions in the literature, no restrictions are imposed on the range space of the learned matrix. The resulting algorithms maintain a linear complexity in the problem size and enjoy important invariance properties. We apply the proposed algorithms to the problem of learning a distance function parameterized by a positive semideﬁnite matrix. Good performance is observed on classical benchmarks.

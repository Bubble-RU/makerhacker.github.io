<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Guang Dai, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We propose a fully Bayesian methodology for generalized kernel mixed models (GKMMs), which are extensions of generalized linear mixed models in the feature space induced by a reproducing kernel. We place a mixture of a point-mass distribution and Silverman’s g-prior on the regression vector of a generalized kernel model (GKM). This mixture prior allows a fraction of the components of the regression vector to be zero. Thus, it serves for sparse modeling and is useful for Bayesian computation. In particular, we exploit data augmentation methodology to develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in which the reversible jump method is used for model selection and a Bayesian model averaging method is used for posterior prediction. When the feature basis expansion in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space is treated as a stochastic process, this approach can be related to the Karhunen-Lo` ve expansion of a Gaussian process (GP). Thus, our sparse e modeling framework leads to a ﬂexible approximation method for GPs.

<p>Author: Tsuyoshi Ueno, Shin-ichi Maeda, Motoaki Kawanabe, Shin Ishii</p><p>Abstract: Since the invention of temporal difference (TD) learning (Sutton, 1988), many new algorithms for model-free policy evaluation have been proposed. Although they have brought much progress in practical applications of reinforcement learning (RL), there still remain fundamental problems concerning statistical properties of the value function estimation. To solve these problems, we introduce a new framework, semiparametric statistical inference, to model-free policy evaluation. This framework generalizes TD learning and its extensions, and allows us to investigate statistical properties of both of batch and online learning procedures for the value function estimation in a uniﬁed way in terms of estimating functions. Furthermore, based on this framework, we derive an optimal estimating function with the minimum asymptotic variance and propose batch and online learning algorithms which achieve the optimality.

Mettu</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms and applications involve repeatedly solving variations of the same inference problem, for example to introduce new evidence to the model or to change conditional dependencies. As the model is updated, the goal of adaptive inference is to take advantage of previously computed quantities to perform inference more rapidly than from scratch. In this paper, we present algorithms for adaptive exact inference on general graphs that can be used to efﬁciently compute marginals and update MAP conﬁgurations under arbitrary changes to the input factor graph and its associated elimination tree. After a linear time preprocessing step, our approach enables updates to the model and the computation of any marginal in time that is logarithmic in the size of the input model. Moreover, in contrast to max-product our approach can also be used to update MAP conﬁgurations in time that is roughly proportional to the number of updated entries, rather than the size of the input model. To evaluate the practical effectiveness of our algorithms, we implement and test them using synthetic data as well as for two real-world computational biology applications. Our experiments show that adaptive inference can achieve substantial speedups over performing complete inference as the model undergoes small changes over time.

<p>Author: Harm van Seijen, Shimon Whiteson, Hado van Hasselt, Marco Wiering</p><p>Abstract: This article presents and evaluates best-match learning, a new approach to reinforcement learning that trades off the sample efﬁciency of model-based methods with the space efﬁciency of modelfree methods. Best-match learning works by approximating the solution to a set of best-match equations, which combine a sparse model with a model-free Q-value function constructed from samples not used by the model. We prove that, unlike regular sparse model-based methods, bestmatch learning is guaranteed to converge to the optimal Q-values in the tabular case. Empirical results demonstrate that best-match learning can substantially outperform regular sparse modelbased methods, as well as several model-free methods that strive to improve the sample efﬁciency of temporal-difference methods. In addition, we demonstrate that best-match learning can be successfully combined with function approximation.

<p>Author: Michael Hahsler, Sudheer Chelluboina, Kurt Hornik, Christian Buchta</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes the ecosystem of R add-on packages developed around the infrastructure provided by the package arules. The packages provide comprehensive functionality for analyzing interesting patterns including frequent itemsets, association rules, frequent sequences and for building applications like associative classiﬁcation. After discussing the ecosystem’s design we illustrate the ease of mining and visualizing rules with a short example. Keywords: frequent itemsets, association rules, frequent sequences, visualization 1. Overview Mining frequent itemsets and association rules is a popular and well researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. Association rules are used in many applications and have become prominent as an important exploratory method for uncovering cross-selling opportunities in large retail databases. Agrawal et al. (1993) introduced the problem of mining association rules from transaction data as follows: Let I = {i1 , i2 , . . . , in } be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let D = {t1 ,t2 , . . . ,tm } be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I. A rule is deﬁned as an implication of the form X ⇒ Y where / X,Y ⊆ I and X ∩ Y = 0 are called itemsets. On itemsets and rules several quality measures can be deﬁned. The most important measures are support and conﬁdence. The support supp(X) of an itemset X is deﬁned as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the itemset. Itemsets with a support which surpasses a user deﬁned threshold σ are called frequent itemsets. The conﬁdence of a rule is deﬁned as conf(X ⇒ Y ) = supp(X ∪Y )/supp(X). Association rules are rules with supp(X ∪Y ) ≥ σ and conf(X) ≥ δ where σ and δ are user deﬁned thresholds. ©2011 Michael Hahsler, Sudheer Chelluboina, Kurt Hornik and Christian Buchta. H AHSLER , C HELLUBOINA , H ORNIK AND B UCHTA Figure 1: The arules ecosystem. The R package arules (Hahsler et al., 2005, 2010) implements the basic infrastructure for creating and manipulating transaction databases and basic algorithms to efﬁciently ﬁnd and analyze association rules. Over the last ﬁve years several packages were built around the arules infrastructure to create the ecosystem shown in Figure 1. Compared to other tools, the arules ecosystem is fully integrated, implements the latest approaches and has the vast functionality of R for further analysis of found patterns at its disposal. 2. Design and Implementation The core package arules provides an object-oriented framework to represent transaction databases and patterns. To facilitate extensibility, patterns are implemented as an abstract superclass associations and then concrete subclasses implement individual types of patterns. In arules the associations itemsets and rules are provided. Databases and associations both use a sparse matrix representation for efﬁcient storage and basic operations like sorting, subsetting and matching are supported. Different aspects of arules were discussed in previous publications (Hahsler et al., 2005; Hahsler and Hornik, 2007b,a; Hahsler et al., 2008). In this paper we focus on the ecosystem of several R-packages which are built on top of the arules infrastructure. While arules provides Apriori and Eclat (implementations by Borgelt, 2003), two of the most important frequent itemset/association rule mining algorithms, additional algorithms can easily be added as new packages. For example, package arulesNBMiner (Hahsler, 2010) implements an algorithm to ﬁnd NB-frequent itemsets (Hahsler, 2006). A collection of further implementations which could be interfaced by arules in the future and a comparison of state-of-the-art algorithms can be found at the Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Repository.1 arulesSequences (Buchta and Hahsler, 2010) implements mining frequent sequences in transaction databases. It implements additional association classes called sequences and sequencerules and provides the algorithm cSpade (Zaki, 2001) to efﬁciently mine frequent sequences. Another application currently under development is arulesClassify which uses the arules infrastructure to implement rule-based classiﬁers, including Classiﬁcation Based on Association rules (CBA, Liu et al., 1998) and general associative classiﬁcation techniques (Jalali-Heravi and Zaïane, 2010). A known drawback of mining for frequent patterns such as association rules is that typically the algorithm returns a very large set of results where only a small fraction of patterns is of interest to the analysts. Many researchers introduced visualization techniques including scatter plots, matrix 1.

Finally, arules provides a Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) interface to import and export rules via package pmml (Williams et al., 2010). PMML is the leading standard for exchanging statistical and data mining models and is supported by all major solution providers. Although pmml provides interfaces for different packages it is still considered part of the arules ecosystem. The packages in the described ecosystem are available for Linux, OS X and Windows. All packages are distributed via the Comprehensive R Archive Network2 under GPL-2, along with comprehensive manuals, documentation, regression tests and source code. Development versions of most packages are available from R-Forge.3 3. User Interface We illustrate the user interface and the interaction between the packages in the arules ecosystem with a small example using a retail data set called Groceries which contains 9835 transactions with items aggregated to 169 categories. We mine association rules and then present the rules found as well as the top 3 rules according to the interest measure lift (deviation from independence) in two visualizations. > > > > library(</p><p>5 0.069012128 <a title="65-lsi-5" href="./jmlr-2011-Non-Parametric_Estimation_of_Topic_Hierarchies_from_Texts_with_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes.html">70 jmlr-2011-Non-Parametric Estimation of Topic Hierarchies from Texts with Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Elias Zavitsanos, Georgios Paliouras, George A. Vouros</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents hHDP, a hierarchical algorithm for representing a document collection as a hierarchy of latent topics, based on Dirichlet process priors. The hierarchical nature of the algorithm refers to the Bayesian hierarchy that it comprises, as well as to the hierarchy of the latent topics. hHDP relies on nonparametric Bayesian priors and it is able to infer a hierarchy of topics, without making any assumption about the depth of the learned hierarchy and the branching factor at each level. We evaluate the proposed method on real-world data sets in document modeling, as well as in ontology learning, and provide qualitative and quantitative evaluation results, showing that the model is robust, it models accurately the training data set and is able to generalize on held-out data.

<p>Author: Sandra Zilles, Steffen Lange, Robert Holte, Martin Zinkevich</p><p>Abstract: While most supervised machine learning models assume that training examples are sampled at random or adversarially, this article is concerned with models of learning from a cooperative teacher that selects “helpful” training examples. The number of training examples a learner needs for identifying a concept in a given class C of possible target concepts (sample complexity of C) is lower in models assuming such teachers, that is, “helpful” examples can speed up the learning process. The problem of how a teacher and a learner can cooperate in order to reduce the sample complexity, yet without using “coding tricks”, has been widely addressed. Nevertheless, the resulting teaching and learning protocols do not seem to make the teacher select intuitively “helpful” examples. The two models introduced in this paper are built on what we call subset teaching sets and recursive teaching sets. They extend previous models of teaching by letting both the teacher and the learner exploit knowing that the partner is cooperative. For this purpose, we introduce a new notion of “coding trick”/“collusion”. We show how both resulting sample complexity measures (the subset teaching dimension and the recursive teaching dimension) can be arbitrarily lower than the classic teaching dimension and known variants thereof, without using coding tricks. For instance, monomials can be taught with only two examples independent of the number of variables. The subset teaching dimension turns out to be nonmonotonic with respect to subclasses of concept classes. We discuss why this nonmonotonicity might be inherent in many interesting cooperative teaching and learning scenarios.

<p>Author: Şeyda Ertekin, Cynthia Rudin</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate that there are machine learning algorithms that can achieve success for two separate tasks simultaneously, namely the tasks of classiﬁcation and bipartite ranking. This means that advantages gained from solving one task can be carried over to the other task, such as the ability to obtain conditional density estimates, and an order-of-magnitude reduction in computational time for training the algorithm. It also means that some algorithms are robust to the choice of evaluation metric used; they can theoretically perform well when performance is measured either by a misclassiﬁcation error or by a statistic of the ROC curve (such as the area under the curve). Speciﬁcally, we provide such an equivalence relationship between a generalization of Freund et al.’s RankBoost algorithm, called the “P-Norm Push,” and a particular cost-sensitive classiﬁcation algorithm that generalizes AdaBoost, which we call “P-Classiﬁcation.” We discuss and validate the potential beneﬁts of this equivalence relationship, and perform controlled experiments to understand P-Classiﬁcation’s empirical performance. There is no established equivalence relationship for logistic regression and its ranking counterpart, so we introduce a logistic-regression-style algorithm that aims in between classiﬁcation and ranking, and has promising experimental performance with respect to both tasks.

<p>Author: Shipeng Yu, Balaji Krishnapuram, Rómer Rosales, R. Bharat Rao</p><p>Abstract: Co-training (or more generally, co-regularization) has been a popular algorithm for semi-supervised learning in data with two feature representations (or views), but the fundamental assumptions underlying this type of models are still unclear. In this paper we propose a Bayesian undirected graphical model for co-training, or more generally for semi-supervised multi-view learning. This makes explicit the previously unstated assumptions of a large class of co-training type algorithms, and also clariﬁes the circumstances under which these assumptions fail. Building upon new insights from this model, we propose an improved method for co-training, which is a novel co-training kernel for Gaussian process classiﬁers. The resulting approach is convex and avoids local-maxima problems, and it can also automatically estimate how much each view should be trusted to accommodate noisy or unreliable views. The Bayesian co-training approach can also elegantly handle data samples with missing views, that is, some of the views are not available for some data points at learning time. This is further extended to an active sensing framework, in which the missing (sample, view) pairs are actively acquired to improve learning performance. The strength of active sensing model is that one actively sensed (sample, view) pair would improve the joint multi-view classiﬁcation on all the samples. Experiments on toy data and several real world data sets illustrate the beneﬁts of this approach.

<p>Author: Julian J. McAuley, TibĂŠrio S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: Maximum A Posteriori inference in graphical models is often solved via message-passing algorithms, such as the junction-tree algorithm or loopy belief-propagation. The exact solution to this problem is well-known to be exponential in the size of the maximal cliques of the triangulated model, while approximate inference is typically exponential in the size of the modelĂ˘&euro;&trade;s factors. In this paper, we take advantage of the fact that many models have maximal cliques that are larger than their constituent factors, and also of the fact that many factors consist only of latent variables (i.e., they do not depend on an observation). This is a common case in a wide variety of applications that deal with grid-, tree-, and ring-structured models. In such cases, we are able to decrease the exponent of complexity for message-passing by 0.5 for both exact and approximate inference. We demonstrate that message-passing operations in such models are equivalent to some variant of matrix multiplication in the tropical semiring, for which we offer an O(N 2.5 ) expected-case solution.

<p>Author: Aad van der Vaart, Harry van Zanten</p><p>Abstract: We consider the quality of learning a response function by a nonparametric Bayesian approach using a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the response function. We upper bound the quadratic risk of the learning procedure, which in turn is an upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler information between the predictive and true data distribution. The upper bound is expressed in small ball probabilities and concentration measures of the GP prior. We illustrate the computation of the upper bound for the Mat´ rn and squared exponential kernels. For these priors the risk, and hence the e information criterion, tends to zero for all continuous response functions. However, the rate at which this happens depends on the combination of true response function and Gaussian prior, and is expressible in a certain concentration function. In particular, the results show that for good performance, the regularity of the GP prior should match the regularity of the unknown response function.

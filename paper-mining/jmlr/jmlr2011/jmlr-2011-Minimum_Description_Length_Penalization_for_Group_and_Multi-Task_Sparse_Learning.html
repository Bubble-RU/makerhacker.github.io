<p>Author: Brian McFee, Gert Lanckriet</p><p>Abstract: In many applications involving multi-media data, the deﬁnition of similarity between items is integral to several key tasks, including nearest-neighbor retrieval, classiﬁcation, and recommendation. Data in such regimes typically exhibits multiple modalities, such as acoustic and visual content of video. Integrating such heterogeneous data to form a holistic similarity space is therefore a key challenge to be overcome in many real-world applications. We present a novel multiple kernel learning technique for integrating heterogeneous data into a single, uniﬁed similarity space. Our algorithm learns an optimal ensemble of kernel transformations which conform to measurements of human perceptual similarity, as expressed by relative comparisons. To cope with the ubiquitous problems of subjectivity and inconsistency in multimedia similarity, we develop graph-based techniques to ﬁlter similarity measurements, resulting in a simpliﬁed and robust training procedure.

<p>Author: Junzhou Huang, Tong Zhang, Dimitris Metaxas</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates a learning formulation called structured sparsity, which is a natural extension of the standard sparsity concept in statistical learning and compressive sensing. By allowing arbitrary structures on the feature set, this concept generalizes the group sparsity idea that has become popular in recent years. A general theory is developed for learning with structured sparsity, based on the notion of coding complexity associated with the structure. It is shown that if the coding complexity of the target signal is small, then one can achieve improved performance by using coding complexity regularization methods, which generalize the standard sparse regularization. Moreover, a structured greedy algorithm is proposed to efﬁciently solve the structured sparsity problem. It is shown that the greedy algorithm approximately solves the coding complexity optimization problem under appropriate conditions. Experiments are included to demonstrate the advantage of structured sparsity over standard sparsity on some real applications.

<p>Author: Jérémie Bigot, Rolando J. Biscay, Jean-Michel Loubes, Lillian Muñiz-Alvarez</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Group Lasso estimator of the covariance matrix of a stochastic process corrupted by an additive noise. We propose to estimate the covariance matrix in a highdimensional setting under the assumption that the process has a sparse representation in a large dictionary of basis functions. Using a matrix regression model, we propose a new methodology for high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation based on empirical contrast regularization by a group Lasso penalty. Using such a penalty, the method selects a sparse set of basis functions in the dictionary used to approximate the process, leading to an approximation of the covariance matrix into a low dimensional space. Consistency of the estimator is studied in Frobenius and operator norms and an application to sparse PCA is proposed.

<p>Author: Ronan Collobert, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou, Michael Karlen, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Pavel Kuksa</p><p>Abstract: We propose a uniﬁed neural network architecture and learning algorithm that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-speciﬁc engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.

<p>Author: Ashwin Srinivasan, Ganesh Ramakrishnan</p><p>Abstract: Reports of experiments conducted with an Inductive Logic Programming system rarely describe how speciﬁc values of parameters of the system are arrived at when constructing models. Usually, no attempt is made to identify sensitive parameters, and those that are used are often given “factory-supplied” default values, or values obtained from some non-systematic exploratory analysis. The immediate consequence of this is, of course, that it is not clear if better models could have been obtained if some form of parameter selection and optimisation had been performed. Questions follow inevitably on the experiments themselves: speciﬁcally, are all algorithms being treated fairly, and is the exploratory phase sufﬁciently well-deﬁned to allow the experiments to be replicated? In this paper, we investigate the use of parameter selection and optimisation techniques grouped under the study of experimental design. Screening and response surface methods determine, in turn, sensitive parameters and good values for these parameters. Screening is done here by constructing a stepwise regression model relating the utility of an ILP system’s hypothesis to its input parameters, using systematic combinations of values of input parameters (technically speaking, we use a two-level fractional factorial design of the input parameters). The parameters used by the regression model are taken to be the sensitive parameters for the system for that application. We then seek an assignment of values to these sensitive parameters that maximise the utility of the ILP model. This is done using the technique of constructing a local “response surface”. The parameters are then changed following the path of steepest ascent until a locally optimal value is reached. This combined use of parameter selection and response surface-driven optimisation has a long history of application in industrial engineering, and its role in ILP is demonstrated using well-known benchmarks.

<p>Author: Peilin Zhao, Steven C.H. Hoi, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: In most kernel based online learning algorithms, when an incoming instance is misclassiﬁed, it will be added into the pool of support vectors and assigned with a weight, which often remains unchanged during the rest of the learning process. This is clearly insufﬁcient since when a new support vector is added, we generally expect the weights of the other existing support vectors to be updated in order to reﬂect the inﬂuence of the added support vector. In this paper, we propose a new online learning method, termed Double Updating Online Learning, or DUOL for short, that explicitly addresses this problem. Instead of only assigning a ﬁxed weight to the misclassiﬁed example received at the current trial, the proposed online learning algorithm also tries to update the weight for one of the existing support vectors. We show that the mistake bound can be improved by the proposed online learning method. We conduct an extensive set of empirical evaluations for both binary and multi-class online learning tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed technique is considerably more effective than the state-of-the-art online learning algorithms.

MIC provides an elegant way of incorporating arbitrary sparsity patterns in the feature space by using two-part MDL coding schemes. We present MIC based models for the problems of grouped feature selection (MICG ROUP) and multi-task feature selection (MIC-M ULTI). MIC-G ROUP assumes that the features are divided into groups and induces two level sparsity, selecting a subset of the feature groups, and also selecting features within each selected group. MIC-M ULTI applies when there are multiple related tasks that share the same set of potentially predictive features. It also induces two level sparsity, selecting a subset of the features, and then selecting which of the tasks each feature should be added to. Lastly, we propose a model, T RANS F EAT, that can be used to transfer knowledge from a set of previously learned tasks to a new task that is expected to share similar features. All three methods are designed for selecting a small set of predictive features from a large pool of candidate features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with experimental results on data from genomics and from word sense disambiguation problems.1 Keywords: feature selection, minimum description length principle, multi-task learning</p><p>3 0.89584619 <a title="64-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2011-Convex_and_Network_Flow_Optimization_for_Structured_Sparsity.html">20 jmlr-2011-Convex and Network Flow Optimization for Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Rodolphe Jenatton, Guillaume Obozinski, Francis Bach</p><p>Abstract: We consider a class of learning problems regularized by a structured sparsity-inducing norm deﬁned as the sum of ℓ2 - or ℓ∞ -norms over groups of variables. Whereas much effort has been put in developing fast optimization techniques when the groups are disjoint or embedded in a hierarchy, we address here the case of general overlapping groups. To this end, we present two different strategies: On the one hand, we show that the proximal operator associated with a sum of ℓ∞ norms can be computed exactly in polynomial time by solving a quadratic min-cost ﬂow problem, allowing the use of accelerated proximal gradient methods. On the other hand, we use proximal splitting techniques, and address an equivalent formulation with non-overlapping groups, but in higher dimension and with additional constraints. We propose efﬁcient and scalable algorithms exploiting these two strategies, which are signiﬁcantly faster than alternative approaches. We illustrate these methods with several problems such as CUR matrix factorization, multi-task learning of tree-structured dictionaries, background subtraction in video sequences, image denoising with wavelets, and topographic dictionary learning of natural image patches.

<p>Author: Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: A multitask learning framework is developed for discriminative classiﬁcation and regression where multiple large-margin linear classiﬁers are estimated for different prediction problems. These classiﬁers operate in a common input space but are coupled as they recover an unknown shared representation. A maximum entropy discrimination (MED) framework is used to derive the multitask algorithm which involves only convex optimization problems that are straightforward to implement. Three multitask scenarios are described. The ﬁrst multitask method produces multiple support vector machines that learn a shared sparse feature selection over the input space. The second multitask method produces multiple support vector machines that learn a shared conic kernel combination. The third multitask method produces a pooled classiﬁer as well as adaptively specialized individual classiﬁers. Furthermore, extensions to regression, graphical model structure estimation and other sparse methods are discussed. The maximum entropy optimization problems are implemented via a sequential quadratic programming method which leverages recent progress in fast SVM solvers. Fast monotonic convergence bounds are provided by bounding the MED sparsifying cost function with a quadratic function and ensuring only a constant factor runtime increase above standard independent SVM solvers. Results are shown on multitask data sets and favor multitask learning over single-task or tabula rasa methods.

<p>Author: Junzhou Huang, Tong Zhang, Dimitris Metaxas</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates a learning formulation called structured sparsity, which is a natural extension of the standard sparsity concept in statistical learning and compressive sensing. By allowing arbitrary structures on the feature set, this concept generalizes the group sparsity idea that has become popular in recent years. A general theory is developed for learning with structured sparsity, based on the notion of coding complexity associated with the structure. It is shown that if the coding complexity of the target signal is small, then one can achieve improved performance by using coding complexity regularization methods, which generalize the standard sparse regularization. Moreover, a structured greedy algorithm is proposed to efﬁciently solve the structured sparsity problem. It is shown that the greedy algorithm approximately solves the coding complexity optimization problem under appropriate conditions. Experiments are included to demonstrate the advantage of structured sparsity over standard sparsity on some real applications.

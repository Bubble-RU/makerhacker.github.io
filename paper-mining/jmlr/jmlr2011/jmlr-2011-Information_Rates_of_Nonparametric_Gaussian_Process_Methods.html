<p>Author: Adam D. Bull</p><p>Abstract: In the efﬁcient global optimization problem, we minimize an unknown function f , using as few observations f (x) as possible. It can be considered a continuum-armed-bandit problem, with noiseless data, and simple regret. Expected-improvement algorithms are perhaps the most popular methods for solving the problem; in this paper, we provide theoretical results on their asymptotic behaviour. Implementing these algorithms requires a choice of Gaussian-process prior, which determines an associated space of functions, its reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). When the prior is ﬁxed, expected improvement is known to converge on the minimum of any function in its RKHS. We provide convergence rates for this procedure, optimal for functions of low smoothness, and describe a modiﬁed algorithm attaining optimal rates for smoother functions. In practice, however, priors are typically estimated sequentially from the data. For standard estimators, we show this procedure may never ﬁnd the minimum of f . We then propose alternative estimators, chosen to minimize the constants in the rate of convergence, and show these estimators retain the convergence rates of a ﬁxed prior.

<p>Author: Lauren A. Hannah, David M. Blei, Warren B. Powell</p><p>Abstract: We propose Dirichlet Process mixtures of Generalized Linear Models (DP-GLM), a new class of methods for nonparametric regression. Given a data set of input-response pairs, the DP-GLM produces a global model of the joint distribution through a mixture of local generalized linear models. DP-GLMs allow both continuous and categorical inputs, and can model the same class of responses that can be modeled with a generalized linear model. We study the properties of the DP-GLM, and show why it provides better predictions and density estimates than existing Dirichlet process mixture regression models. We give conditions for weak consistency of the joint distribution and pointwise consistency of the regression estimate.

<p>Author: Vincent Y.F. Tan, Animashree Anandkumar, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning forest-structured discrete graphical models from i.i.d. samples is considered. An algorithm based on pruning of the Chow-Liu tree through adaptive thresholding is proposed. It is shown that this algorithm is both structurally consistent and risk consistent and the error probability of structure learning decays faster than any polynomial in the number of samples under ﬁxed model size. For the high-dimensional scenario where the size of the model d and the number of edges k scale with the number of samples n, sufﬁcient conditions on (n, d, k) are given for the algorithm to satisfy structural and risk consistencies. In addition, the extremal structures for learning are identiﬁed; we prove that the independent (resp., tree) model is the hardest (resp., easiest) to learn using the proposed algorithm in terms of error rates for structure learning.

<p>Author: Bharath K. Sriperumbudur, Kenji Fukumizu, Gert R.G. Lanckriet</p><p>Abstract: Over the last few years, two different notions of positive deﬁnite (pd) kernels—universal and characteristic—have been developing in parallel in machine learning: universal kernels are proposed in the context of achieving the Bayes risk by kernel-based classiﬁcation/regression algorithms while characteristic kernels are introduced in the context of distinguishing probability measures by embedding them into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, the relation between these two notions is not well understood. The main contribution of this paper is to clarify the relation between universal and characteristic kernels by presenting a unifying study relating them to RKHS embedding of measures, in addition to clarifying their relation to other common notions of strictly pd, conditionally strictly pd and integrally strictly pd kernels. For radial kernels on Rd , all these notions are shown to be equivalent.

<p>Author: Bruno Pelletier, Pierre Pudlo</p><p>Abstract: Following Hartigan (1975), a cluster is deﬁned as a connected component of the t-level set of the underlying density, that is, the set of points for which the density is greater than t. A clustering algorithm which combines a density estimate with spectral clustering techniques is proposed. Our algorithm is composed of two steps. First, a nonparametric density estimate is used to extract the data points for which the estimated density takes a value greater than t. Next, the extracted points are clustered based on the eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian matrix. Under mild assumptions, we prove the almost sure convergence in operator norm of the empirical graph Laplacian operator associated with the algorithm. Furthermore, we give the typical behavior of the representation of the data set into the feature space, which establishes the strong consistency of our proposed algorithm.

<p>Author: Huixin Wang, Xiaotong Shen, Wei Pan</p><p>Abstract: In hierarchical classiﬁcation, class labels are structured, that is each label value corresponds to one non-root node in a tree, where the inter-class relationship for classiﬁcation is speciﬁed by directed paths of the tree. In such a situation, the focus has been on how to leverage the interclass relationship to enhance the performance of ﬂat classiﬁcation, which ignores such dependency. This is critical when the number of classes becomes large relative to the sample size. This paper considers single-path or partial-path hierarchical classiﬁcation, where only one path is permitted from the root to a leaf node. A large margin method is introduced based on a new concept of generalized margins with respect to hierarchy. For implementation, we consider support vector machines and ψ-learning. Numerical and theoretical analyses suggest that the proposed method achieves the desired objective and compares favorably against strong competitors in the literature, including its ﬂat counterparts. Finally, an application to gene function prediction is discussed.

<p>Author: Liwei Wang, Masashi Sugiyama, Zhaoxiang Jing, Cheng Yang, Zhi-Hua Zhou, Jufu Feng</p><p>Abstract: Much attention has been paid to the theoretical explanation of the empirical success of AdaBoost. The most inﬂuential work is the margin theory, which is essentially an upper bound for the generalization error of any voting classiﬁer in terms of the margin distribution over the training data. However, important questions were raised about the margin explanation. Breiman (1999) proved a bound in terms of the minimum margin, which is sharper than the margin distribution bound. He argued that the minimum margin would be better in predicting the generalization error. Grove and Schuurmans (1998) developed an algorithm called LP-AdaBoost which maximizes the minimum margin while keeping all other factors the same as AdaBoost. In experiments however, LP-AdaBoost usually performs worse than AdaBoost, putting the margin explanation into serious doubt. In this paper, we make a reﬁned analysis of the margin theory. We prove a bound in terms of a new margin measure called the Equilibrium margin (Emargin). The Emargin bound is uniformly ©2011 Liwei Wang, Masashi Sugiyama, Zhaoxiang Jing, Cheng Yang, Zhi-Hua Zhou and Jufu Feng.

We also show that a large Emargin and a small empirical error at Emargin imply a smaller bound of the generalization error. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate that AdaBoost usually has a larger Emargin and a smaller test error than LP-AdaBoost, which agrees well with our theory.

<p>Author: Bruno Pelletier, Pierre Pudlo</p><p>Abstract: Following Hartigan (1975), a cluster is deﬁned as a connected component of the t-level set of the underlying density, that is, the set of points for which the density is greater than t. A clustering algorithm which combines a density estimate with spectral clustering techniques is proposed. Our algorithm is composed of two steps. First, a nonparametric density estimate is used to extract the data points for which the estimated density takes a value greater than t. Next, the extracted points are clustered based on the eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian matrix. Under mild assumptions, we prove the almost sure convergence in operator norm of the empirical graph Laplacian operator associated with the algorithm. Furthermore, we give the typical behavior of the representation of the data set into the feature space, which establishes the strong consistency of our proposed algorithm.

<p>Author: Daniel Vainsencher, Shie Mannor, Alfred M. Bruckstein</p><p>Abstract: A large set of signals can sometimes be described sparsely using a dictionary, that is, every element can be represented as a linear combination of few elements from the dictionary. Algorithms for various signal processing applications, including classiﬁcation, denoising and signal separation, learn a dictionary from a given set of signals to be represented. Can we expect that the error in representing by such a dictionary a previously unseen signal from the same source will be of similar magnitude as those for the given examples? We assume signals are generated from a ﬁxed distribution, and study these questions from a statistical learning theory perspective. We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for two types of constraints on the coefﬁcient selection, as measured by the expected L2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case of l1 regularized coefﬁcient selection we provide a generalnp ln(mλ)/m , where n is the dimension, p is the number of ization bound of the order of O elements in the dictionary, λ is a bound on the l1 norm of the coefﬁcient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most k dictionary elements, we provide a bound of the order O( np ln(mk)/m) under an assumption on the closeness to orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense. Our results also include bounds that converge as 1/m, not previously known for this problem. We provide similar results in a general setting using kernels with weak smoothness requirements.

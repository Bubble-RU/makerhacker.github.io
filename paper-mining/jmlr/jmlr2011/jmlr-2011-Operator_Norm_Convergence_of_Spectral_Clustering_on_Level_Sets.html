<p>Author: Liwei Wang</p><p>Abstract: We study pool-based active learning in the presence of noise, that is, the agnostic setting. It is known that the effectiveness of agnostic active learning depends on the learning problem and the hypothesis space. Although there are many cases on which active learning is very useful, it is also easy to construct examples that no active learning algorithm can have an advantage. Previous works have shown that the label complexity of active learning relies on the disagreement coefﬁcient which often characterizes the intrinsic difﬁculty of the learning problem. In this paper, we study the disagreement coefﬁcient of classiﬁcation problems for which the classiﬁcation boundary is smooth and the data distribution has a density that can be bounded by a smooth function. We prove upper and lower bounds for the disagreement coefﬁcients of both ﬁnitely and inﬁnitely smooth problems. Combining with existing results, it shows that active learning is superior to passive supervised learning for smooth problems.

<p>Author: Antti Ukkonen</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of clustering a set of chains to k clusters. A chain is a totally ordered subset of a ﬁnite set of items. Chains are an intuitive way to express preferences over a set of alternatives, as well as a useful representation of ratings in situations where the item-speciﬁc scores are either difﬁcult to obtain, too noisy due to measurement error, or simply not as relevant as the order that they induce over the items. First we adapt the classical k-means for chains by proposing a suitable distance function and a centroid structure. We also present two different approaches for mapping chains to a vector space. The ﬁrst one is related to the planted partition model, while the second one has an intuitive geometrical interpretation. Finally we discuss a randomization test for assessing the signiﬁcance of a clustering. To this end we present an MCMC algorithm for sampling random sets of chains that share certain properties with the original data. The methods are studied in a series of experiments using real and artiﬁcial data. Results indicate that the methods produce interesting clusterings, and for certain types of inputs improve upon previous work on clustering algorithms for orders.

<p>Author: Adam D. Bull</p><p>Abstract: In the efﬁcient global optimization problem, we minimize an unknown function f , using as few observations f (x) as possible. It can be considered a continuum-armed-bandit problem, with noiseless data, and simple regret. Expected-improvement algorithms are perhaps the most popular methods for solving the problem; in this paper, we provide theoretical results on their asymptotic behaviour. Implementing these algorithms requires a choice of Gaussian-process prior, which determines an associated space of functions, its reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). When the prior is ﬁxed, expected improvement is known to converge on the minimum of any function in its RKHS. We provide convergence rates for this procedure, optimal for functions of low smoothness, and describe a modiﬁed algorithm attaining optimal rates for smoother functions. In practice, however, priors are typically estimated sequentially from the data. For standard estimators, we show this procedure may never ﬁnd the minimum of f . We then propose alternative estimators, chosen to minimize the constants in the rate of convergence, and show these estimators retain the convergence rates of a ﬁxed prior.

<p>Author: Aad van der Vaart, Harry van Zanten</p><p>Abstract: We consider the quality of learning a response function by a nonparametric Bayesian approach using a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the response function. We upper bound the quadratic risk of the learning procedure, which in turn is an upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler information between the predictive and true data distribution. The upper bound is expressed in small ball probabilities and concentration measures of the GP prior. We illustrate the computation of the upper bound for the Mat´ rn and squared exponential kernels. For these priors the risk, and hence the e information criterion, tends to zero for all continuous response functions. However, the rate at which this happens depends on the combination of true response function and Gaussian prior, and is expressible in a certain concentration function. In particular, the results show that for good performance, the regularity of the GP prior should match the regularity of the unknown response function.

<p>Author: Vladimir V. V'yugin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper the sequential prediction problem with expert advice is considered for the case where losses of experts suffered at each step cannot be bounded in advance. We present some modiﬁcation of Kalai and Vempala algorithm of following the perturbed leader where weights depend on past losses of the experts. New notions of a volume and a scaled ﬂuctuation of a game are introduced. We present a probabilistic algorithm protected from unrestrictedly large one-step losses. This algorithm has the optimal performance in the case when the scaled ﬂuctuations of one-step losses of experts of the pool tend to zero.

<p>Author: Bruno Pelletier, Pierre Pudlo</p><p>Abstract: Following Hartigan (1975), a cluster is deﬁned as a connected component of the t-level set of the underlying density, that is, the set of points for which the density is greater than t. A clustering algorithm which combines a density estimate with spectral clustering techniques is proposed. Our algorithm is composed of two steps. First, a nonparametric density estimate is used to extract the data points for which the estimated density takes a value greater than t. Next, the extracted points are clustered based on the eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian matrix. Under mild assumptions, we prove the almost sure convergence in operator norm of the empirical graph Laplacian operator associated with the algorithm. Furthermore, we give the typical behavior of the representation of the data set into the feature space, which establishes the strong consistency of our proposed algorithm.

<p>Author: Daniel Vainsencher, Shie Mannor, Alfred M. Bruckstein</p><p>Abstract: A large set of signals can sometimes be described sparsely using a dictionary, that is, every element can be represented as a linear combination of few elements from the dictionary. Algorithms for various signal processing applications, including classiﬁcation, denoising and signal separation, learn a dictionary from a given set of signals to be represented. Can we expect that the error in representing by such a dictionary a previously unseen signal from the same source will be of similar magnitude as those for the given examples? We assume signals are generated from a ﬁxed distribution, and study these questions from a statistical learning theory perspective. We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for two types of constraints on the coefﬁcient selection, as measured by the expected L2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case of l1 regularized coefﬁcient selection we provide a generalnp ln(mλ)/m , where n is the dimension, p is the number of ization bound of the order of O elements in the dictionary, λ is a bound on the l1 norm of the coefﬁcient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most k dictionary elements, we provide a bound of the order O( np ln(mk)/m) under an assumption on the closeness to orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense. Our results also include bounds that converge as 1/m, not previously known for this problem. We provide similar results in a general setting using kernels with weak smoothness requirements.

<p>Author: Aad van der Vaart, Harry van Zanten</p><p>Abstract: We consider the quality of learning a response function by a nonparametric Bayesian approach using a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the response function. We upper bound the quadratic risk of the learning procedure, which in turn is an upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler information between the predictive and true data distribution. The upper bound is expressed in small ball probabilities and concentration measures of the GP prior. We illustrate the computation of the upper bound for the Mat´ rn and squared exponential kernels. For these priors the risk, and hence the e information criterion, tends to zero for all continuous response functions. However, the rate at which this happens depends on the combination of true response function and Gaussian prior, and is expressible in a certain concentration function. In particular, the results show that for good performance, the regularity of the GP prior should match the regularity of the unknown response function.

<p>Author: Liwei Wang, Masashi Sugiyama, Zhaoxiang Jing, Cheng Yang, Zhi-Hua Zhou, Jufu Feng</p><p>Abstract: Much attention has been paid to the theoretical explanation of the empirical success of AdaBoost. The most inﬂuential work is the margin theory, which is essentially an upper bound for the generalization error of any voting classiﬁer in terms of the margin distribution over the training data. However, important questions were raised about the margin explanation. Breiman (1999) proved a bound in terms of the minimum margin, which is sharper than the margin distribution bound. He argued that the minimum margin would be better in predicting the generalization error. Grove and Schuurmans (1998) developed an algorithm called LP-AdaBoost which maximizes the minimum margin while keeping all other factors the same as AdaBoost. In experiments however, LP-AdaBoost usually performs worse than AdaBoost, putting the margin explanation into serious doubt. In this paper, we make a reﬁned analysis of the margin theory. We prove a bound in terms of a new margin measure called the Equilibrium margin (Emargin). The Emargin bound is uniformly ©2011 Liwei Wang, Masashi Sugiyama, Zhaoxiang Jing, Cheng Yang, Zhi-Hua Zhou and Jufu Feng. WANG , S UGIYAMA , J ING , YANG , Z HOU AND F ENG sharper than Breiman’s minimum margin bound. Thus our result suggests that the minimum margin may be not crucial for the generalization error. We also show that a large Emargin and a small empirical error at Emargin imply a smaller bound of the generalization error. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate that AdaBoost usually has a larger Emargin and a smaller test error than LP-AdaBoost, which agrees well with our theory.

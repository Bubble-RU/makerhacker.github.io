<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Ohad Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We investigate three variants of budgeted learning, a setting in which the learner is allowed to access a limited number of attributes from training or test examples. In the “local budget” setting, where a constraint is imposed on the number of available attributes per training example, we design and analyze an efﬁcient algorithm for learning linear predictors that actively samples the attributes of each training instance. Our analysis bounds the number of additional examples sufﬁcient to compensate for the lack of full information on the training set. This result is complemented by a general lower bound for the easier “global budget” setting, where it is only the overall number of accessible training attributes that is being constrained. In the third, “prediction on a budget” setting, when the constraint is on the number of available attributes per test example, we show that there are cases in which there exists a linear predictor with zero error but it is statistically impossible to achieve arbitrary accuracy without full information on test examples. Finally, we run simple experiments on a digit recognition problem that reveal that our algorithm has a good performance against both partial information and full information baselines.

<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: The online multi-armed bandit problem and its generalizations are repeated decision making problems, where the goal is to select one of several possible decisions in every round, and incur a cost associated with the decision, in such a way that the total cost incurred over all iterations is close to the cost of the best ﬁxed decision in hindsight. The difference in these costs is known as the regret of the algorithm. The term bandit refers to the setting where one only obtains the cost of the decision used in a given iteration and no other information. A very general form of this problem is the non-stochastic bandit linear optimization problem, where the set of decisions is a convex set in some√ Euclidean space, and the cost functions are linear. ˜ Only recently an efﬁcient algorithm attaining O( T ) regret was discovered in this setting. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for the bandit linear optimization problem which √ ˜ obtains a tighter regret bound of O( Q), where Q is the total variation in the cost functions. This regret bound, previously conjectured to hold in the full information case, shows that it is possible to incur much less regret in a slowly changing environment even in the bandit setting. Our algorithm is efﬁcient and applies several new ideas to bandit optimization such as reservoir sampling.

<p>Author: Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: We unify f -divergences, Bregman divergences, surrogate regret bounds, proper scoring rules, cost curves, ROC-curves and statistical information. We do this by systematically studying integral and variational representations of these objects and in so doing identify their representation primitives which all are related to cost-sensitive binary classiﬁcation. As well as developing relationships between generative and discriminative views of learning, the new machinery leads to tight and more general surrogate regret bounds and generalised Pinsker inequalities relating f -divergences to variational divergence. The new viewpoint also illuminates existing algorithms: it provides a new derivation of Support Vector Machines in terms of divergences and relates maximum mean discrepancy to Fisher linear discriminants.

<p>Author: M. Pawan Kumar, Olga Veksler, Philip H.S. Torr</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of obtaining an approximate maximum a posteriori estimate of a discrete random ﬁeld characterized by pairwise potentials that form a truncated convex model. For this problem, we propose two st-MINCUT based move making algorithms that we call Range Swap and Range Expansion. Our algorithms can be thought of as extensions of αβ-Swap and α-Expansion respectively that fully exploit the form of the pairwise potentials. Speciﬁcally, instead of dealing with one or two labels at each iteration, our methods explore a large search space by considering a range of labels (that is, an interval of consecutive labels). Furthermore, we show that Range Expansion provides the same multiplicative bounds as the standard linear programming (LP) relaxation in polynomial time. Compared to previous approaches based on the LP relaxation, for example interior-point algorithms or tree-reweighted message passing (TRW), our methods are faster as they use only the efﬁcient st-MINCUT algorithm in their design. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approaches on both synthetic and standard real data problems.

<p>Author: Huixin Wang, Xiaotong Shen, Wei Pan</p><p>Abstract: In hierarchical classiﬁcation, class labels are structured, that is each label value corresponds to one non-root node in a tree, where the inter-class relationship for classiﬁcation is speciﬁed by directed paths of the tree. In such a situation, the focus has been on how to leverage the interclass relationship to enhance the performance of ﬂat classiﬁcation, which ignores such dependency. This is critical when the number of classes becomes large relative to the sample size. This paper considers single-path or partial-path hierarchical classiﬁcation, where only one path is permitted from the root to a leaf node. A large margin method is introduced based on a new concept of generalized margins with respect to hierarchy. For implementation, we consider support vector machines and ψ-learning. Numerical and theoretical analyses suggest that the proposed method achieves the desired objective and compares favorably against strong competitors in the literature, including its ﬂat counterparts. Finally, an application to gene function prediction is discussed.

<p>Author: Vladimir V. V'yugin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper the sequential prediction problem with expert advice is considered for the case where losses of experts suffered at each step cannot be bounded in advance. We present some modiﬁcation of Kalai and Vempala algorithm of following the perturbed leader where weights depend on past losses of the experts. New notions of a volume and a scaled ﬂuctuation of a game are introduced. We present a probabilistic algorithm protected from unrestrictedly large one-step losses. This algorithm has the optimal performance in the case when the scaled ﬂuctuations of one-step losses of experts of the pool tend to zero.

<p>Author: Mauricio A. Álvarez, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: Recently there has been an increasing interest in regression methods that deal with multiple outputs. This has been motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From a Gaussian processes perspective, the problem reduces to specifying an appropriate covariance function that, whilst being positive semi-deﬁnite, captures the dependencies between all the data points and across all the outputs. One approach to account for non-trivial correlations between outputs employs convolution processes. Under a latent function interpretation of the convolution transform we establish dependencies between output variables. The main drawbacks of this approach are the associated computational and storage demands. In this paper we address these issues. We present different efﬁcient approximations for dependent output Gaussian processes constructed through the convolution formalism. We exploit the conditional independencies present naturally in the model. This leads to a form of the covariance similar in spirit to the so called PITC and FITC approximations for a single output. We show experimental results with synthetic and real data, in particular, we show results in school exams score prediction, pollution prediction and gene expression data.

<p>Author: Ronan Collobert, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou, Michael Karlen, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Pavel Kuksa</p><p>Abstract: We propose a uniﬁed neural network architecture and learning algorithm that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-speciﬁc engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.

<p>Author: Kamalika Chaudhuri, Claire Monteleoni, Anand D. Sarwate</p><p>Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms are crucial for the increasingly common setting in which personal data, such as medical or ﬁnancial records, are analyzed. We provide general techniques to produce privacy-preserving approximations of classiﬁers learned via (regularized) empirical risk minimization (ERM). These algorithms are private under the ε-differential privacy deﬁnition due to Dwork et al. (2006). First we apply the output perturbation ideas of Dwork et al. (2006), to ERM classiﬁcation. Then we propose a new method, objective perturbation, for privacy-preserving machine learning algorithm design. This method entails perturbing the objective function before optimizing over classiﬁers. If the loss and regularizer satisfy certain convexity and differentiability criteria, we prove theoretical results showing that our algorithms preserve privacy, and provide generalization bounds for linear and nonlinear kernels. We further present a privacypreserving technique for tuning the parameters in general machine learning algorithms, thereby providing end-to-end privacy guarantees for the training process. We apply these results to produce privacy-preserving analogues of regularized logistic regression and support vector machines. We obtain encouraging results from evaluating their performance on real demographic and benchmark data sets. Our results show that both theoretically and empirically, objective perturbation is superior to the previous state-of-the-art, output perturbation, in managing the inherent tradeoff between privacy and learning performance.

<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Ohad Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We investigate three variants of budgeted learning, a setting in which the learner is allowed to access a limited number of attributes from training or test examples. In the “local budget” setting, where a constraint is imposed on the number of available attributes per training example, we design and analyze an efﬁcient algorithm for learning linear predictors that actively samples the attributes of each training instance. Our analysis bounds the number of additional examples sufﬁcient to compensate for the lack of full information on the training set. This result is complemented by a general lower bound for the easier “global budget” setting, where it is only the overall number of accessible training attributes that is being constrained. In the third, “prediction on a budget” setting, when the constraint is on the number of available attributes per test example, we show that there are cases in which there exists a linear predictor with zero error but it is statistically impossible to achieve arbitrary accuracy without full information on test examples. Finally, we run simple experiments on a digit recognition problem that reveal that our algorithm has a good performance against both partial information and full information baselines.

<p>Author: Marek Petrik, Shlomo Zilberstein</p><p>Abstract: Value function approximation methods have been successfully used in many applications, but the prevailing techniques often lack useful a priori error bounds. We propose a new approximate bilinear programming formulation of value function approximation, which employs global optimization. The formulation provides strong a priori guarantees on both robust and expected policy loss by minimizing speciﬁc norms of the Bellman residual. Solving a bilinear program optimally is NP-hard, but this worst-case complexity is unavoidable because the Bellman-residual minimization itself is NP-hard. We describe and analyze the formulation as well as a simple approximate algorithm for solving bilinear programs. The analysis shows that this algorithm offers a convergent generalization of approximate policy iteration. We also brieﬂy analyze the behavior of bilinear programming algorithms under incomplete samples. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can consistently minimize the Bellman residual on simple benchmark problems.

<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Ulf Brefeld, Sören Sonnenburg, Alexander Zien</p><p>Abstract: Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy when the right choice of features is unknown. Previous approaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability and scalability. Unfortunately, this ℓ1 -norm MKL is rarely observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures that generalize well, we extend MKL to arbitrary norms. We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efﬁcient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary norms, that is ℓ p -norms with p ≥ 1. This interleaved optimization is much faster than the commonly used wrapper approaches, as demonstrated on several data sets. A theoretical analysis and an experiment on controlled artiﬁcial data shed light on the appropriateness of sparse, non-sparse and ℓ∞ -norm MKL in various scenarios. Importantly, empirical applications of ℓ p -norm MKL to three real-world problems from computational biology show that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that surpass the state-of-the-art.

<p>Author: Liwei Wang, Masashi Sugiyama, Zhaoxiang Jing, Cheng Yang, Zhi-Hua Zhou, Jufu Feng</p><p>Abstract: Much attention has been paid to the theoretical explanation of the empirical success of AdaBoost. The most inﬂuential work is the margin theory, which is essentially an upper bound for the generalization error of any voting classiﬁer in terms of the margin distribution over the training data. However, important questions were raised about the margin explanation. Breiman (1999) proved a bound in terms of the minimum margin, which is sharper than the margin distribution bound. He argued that the minimum margin would be better in predicting the generalization error. Grove and Schuurmans (1998) developed an algorithm called LP-AdaBoost which maximizes the minimum margin while keeping all other factors the same as AdaBoost. In experiments however, LP-AdaBoost usually performs worse than AdaBoost, putting the margin explanation into serious doubt. In this paper, we make a reﬁned analysis of the margin theory. We prove a bound in terms of a new margin measure called the Equilibrium margin (Emargin). The Emargin bound is uniformly ©2011 Liwei Wang, Masashi Sugiyama, Zhaoxiang Jing, Cheng Yang, Zhi-Hua Zhou and Jufu Feng. WANG , S UGIYAMA , J ING , YANG , Z HOU AND F ENG sharper than Breiman’s minimum margin bound. Thus our result suggests that the minimum margin may be not crucial for the generalization error. We also show that a large Emargin and a small empirical error at Emargin imply a smaller bound of the generalization error. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate that AdaBoost usually has a larger Emargin and a smaller test error than LP-AdaBoost, which agrees well with our theory.

<p>Author: Vincent Y.F. Tan, Animashree Anandkumar, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning forest-structured discrete graphical models from i.i.d. samples is considered. An algorithm based on pruning of the Chow-Liu tree through adaptive thresholding is proposed. It is shown that this algorithm is both structurally consistent and risk consistent and the error probability of structure learning decays faster than any polynomial in the number of samples under ﬁxed model size. For the high-dimensional scenario where the size of the model d and the number of edges k scale with the number of samples n, sufﬁcient conditions on (n, d, k) are given for the algorithm to satisfy structural and risk consistencies. In addition, the extremal structures for learning are identiﬁed; we prove that the independent (resp., tree) model is the hardest (resp., easiest) to learn using the proposed algorithm in terms of error rates for structure learning.

<p>Author: Aad van der Vaart, Harry van Zanten</p><p>Abstract: We consider the quality of learning a response function by a nonparametric Bayesian approach using a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the response function. We upper bound the quadratic risk of the learning procedure, which in turn is an upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler information between the predictive and true data distribution. The upper bound is expressed in small ball probabilities and concentration measures of the GP prior. We illustrate the computation of the upper bound for the Mat´ rn and squared exponential kernels. For these priors the risk, and hence the e information criterion, tends to zero for all continuous response functions. However, the rate at which this happens depends on the combination of true response function and Gaussian prior, and is expressible in a certain concentration function. In particular, the results show that for good performance, the regularity of the GP prior should match the regularity of the unknown response function.

<p>Author: Wei Wu, Jun Xu, Hang Li, Satoshi Oyama</p><p>Abstract: This paper points out that many search relevance models in information retrieval, such as the Vector Space Model, BM25 and Language Models for Information Retrieval, can be viewed as a similarity function between pairs of objects of different types, referred to as an S-function. An S-function is speciﬁcally deﬁned as the dot product between the images of two objects in a Hilbert space mapped from two different input spaces. One advantage of taking this view is that one can take a uniﬁed and principled approach to address the issues with regard to search relevance. The paper then proposes employing a kernel method to learn a robust relevance model as an S-function, which can effectively deal with the term mismatch problem, one of the biggest challenges in search. The kernel method exploits a positive semi-deﬁnite kernel referred to as an S-kernel. The paper shows that when using an S-kernel the model learned by the kernel method is guaranteed to be an S-function. The paper then gives more general principles for constructing S-kernels. A speciﬁc implementation of the kernel method is proposed using the Ranking SVM techniques and click-through data. The proposed approach is employed to learn a relevance model as an extension of BM25, referred to as Robust BM25. Experimental results on web search and enterprise search data show that Robust BM25 signiﬁcantly outperforms baseline methods and can successfully tackle the term mismatch problem.

<p>Author: Benjamin Recht   </p><p>Abstract: This paper provides the best bounds to date on the number of randomly sampled entries required to reconstruct an unknown low-rank matrix. These results improve on prior work by Cand` s and e Recht (2009), Cand` s and Tao (2009), and Keshavan et al. (2009). The reconstruction is accome plished by minimizing the nuclear norm, or sum of the singular values, of the hidden matrix subject to agreement with the provided entries. If the underlying matrix satisﬁes a certain incoherence condition, then the number of entries required is equal to a quadratic logarithmic factor times the number of parameters in the singular value decomposition. The proof of this assertion is short, self contained, and uses very elementary analysis. The novel techniques herein are based on recent work in quantum information theory.

<p>Author: Sandra Zilles, Steffen Lange, Robert Holte, Martin Zinkevich</p><p>Abstract: While most supervised machine learning models assume that training examples are sampled at random or adversarially, this article is concerned with models of learning from a cooperative teacher that selects “helpful” training examples. The number of training examples a learner needs for identifying a concept in a given class C of possible target concepts (sample complexity of C) is lower in models assuming such teachers, that is, “helpful” examples can speed up the learning process. The problem of how a teacher and a learner can cooperate in order to reduce the sample complexity, yet without using “coding tricks”, has been widely addressed. Nevertheless, the resulting teaching and learning protocols do not seem to make the teacher select intuitively “helpful” examples. The two models introduced in this paper are built on what we call subset teaching sets and recursive teaching sets. They extend previous models of teaching by letting both the teacher and the learner exploit knowing that the partner is cooperative. For this purpose, we introduce a new notion of “coding trick”/“collusion”. We show how both resulting sample complexity measures (the subset teaching dimension and the recursive teaching dimension) can be arbitrarily lower than the classic teaching dimension and known variants thereof, without using coding tricks. For instance, monomials can be taught with only two examples independent of the number of variables. The subset teaching dimension turns out to be nonmonotonic with respect to subclasses of concept classes. We discuss why this nonmonotonicity might be inherent in many interesting cooperative teaching and learning scenarios.

<p>Author: Şeyda Ertekin, Cynthia Rudin</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate that there are machine learning algorithms that can achieve success for two separate tasks simultaneously, namely the tasks of classiﬁcation and bipartite ranking. This means that advantages gained from solving one task can be carried over to the other task, such as the ability to obtain conditional density estimates, and an order-of-magnitude reduction in computational time for training the algorithm. It also means that some algorithms are robust to the choice of evaluation metric used; they can theoretically perform well when performance is measured either by a misclassiﬁcation error or by a statistic of the ROC curve (such as the area under the curve). Speciﬁcally, we provide such an equivalence relationship between a generalization of Freund et al.’s RankBoost algorithm, called the “P-Norm Push,” and a particular cost-sensitive classiﬁcation algorithm that generalizes AdaBoost, which we call “P-Classiﬁcation.” We discuss and validate the potential beneﬁts of this equivalence relationship, and perform controlled experiments to understand P-Classiﬁcation’s empirical performance. There is no established equivalence relationship for logistic regression and its ranking counterpart, so we introduce a logistic-regression-style algorithm that aims in between classiﬁcation and ranking, and has promising experimental performance with respect to both tasks.

<p>Author: Daniel Vainsencher, Shie Mannor, Alfred M. Bruckstein</p><p>Abstract: A large set of signals can sometimes be described sparsely using a dictionary, that is, every element can be represented as a linear combination of few elements from the dictionary. Algorithms for various signal processing applications, including classiﬁcation, denoising and signal separation, learn a dictionary from a given set of signals to be represented. Can we expect that the error in representing by such a dictionary a previously unseen signal from the same source will be of similar magnitude as those for the given examples? We assume signals are generated from a ﬁxed distribution, and study these questions from a statistical learning theory perspective. We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for two types of constraints on the coefﬁcient selection, as measured by the expected L2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case of l1 regularized coefﬁcient selection we provide a generalnp ln(mλ)/m , where n is the dimension, p is the number of ization bound of the order of O elements in the dictionary, λ is a bound on the l1 norm of the coefﬁcient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most k dictionary elements, we provide a bound of the order O( np ln(mk)/m) under an assumption on the closeness to orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense. Our results also include bounds that converge as 1/m, not previously known for this problem. We provide similar results in a general setting using kernels with weak smoothness requirements.

<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Ulf Brefeld, Sören Sonnenburg, Alexander Zien</p><p>Abstract: Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy when the right choice of features is unknown. Previous approaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability and scalability. Unfortunately, this ℓ1 -norm MKL is rarely observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures that generalize well, we extend MKL to arbitrary norms. We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efﬁcient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary norms, that is ℓ p -norms with p ≥ 1. This interleaved optimization is much faster than the commonly used wrapper approaches, as demonstrated on several data sets. A theoretical analysis and an experiment on controlled artiﬁcial data shed light on the appropriateness of sparse, non-sparse and ℓ∞ -norm MKL in various scenarios. Importantly, empirical applications of ℓ p -norm MKL to three real-world problems from computational biology show that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that surpass the state-of-the-art.

<p>Author: Benoît Patra</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by the problem of effectively executing clustering algorithms on very large data sets, we address a model for large scale distributed clustering methods. To this end, we brieﬂy recall some standards on the quantization problem and some results on the almost sure convergence of the competitive learning vector quantization (CLVQ) procedure. A general model for linear distributed asynchronous algorithms well adapted to several parallel computing architectures is also discussed. Our approach brings together this scalable model and the CLVQ algorithm, and we call the resulting technique the distributed asynchronous learning vector quantization algorithm (DALVQ). An indepth analysis of the almost sure convergence of the DALVQ algorithm is performed. A striking result is that we prove that the multiple versions of the quantizers distributed among the processors in the parallel architecture asymptotically reach a consensus almost surely. Furthermore, we also show that these versions converge almost surely towards the same nearly optimal value for the quantization criterion.

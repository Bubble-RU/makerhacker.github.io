<p>Author: M. Pawan Kumar, Olga Veksler, Philip H.S. Torr</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of obtaining an approximate maximum a posteriori estimate of a discrete random ﬁeld characterized by pairwise potentials that form a truncated convex model. For this problem, we propose two st-MINCUT based move making algorithms that we call Range Swap and Range Expansion. Our algorithms can be thought of as extensions of αβ-Swap and α-Expansion respectively that fully exploit the form of the pairwise potentials. Speciﬁcally, instead of dealing with one or two labels at each iteration, our methods explore a large search space by considering a range of labels (that is, an interval of consecutive labels). Furthermore, we show that Range Expansion provides the same multiplicative bounds as the standard linear programming (LP) relaxation in polynomial time. Compared to previous approaches based on the LP relaxation, for example interior-point algorithms or tree-reweighted message passing (TRW), our methods are faster as they use only the efﬁcient st-MINCUT algorithm in their design. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approaches on both synthetic and standard real data problems.

<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: The online multi-armed bandit problem and its generalizations are repeated decision making problems, where the goal is to select one of several possible decisions in every round, and incur a cost associated with the decision, in such a way that the total cost incurred over all iterations is close to the cost of the best ﬁxed decision in hindsight. The difference in these costs is known as the regret of the algorithm. The term bandit refers to the setting where one only obtains the cost of the decision used in a given iteration and no other information. A very general form of this problem is the non-stochastic bandit linear optimization problem, where the set of decisions is a convex set in some√ Euclidean space, and the cost functions are linear. ˜ Only recently an efﬁcient algorithm attaining O( T ) regret was discovered in this setting. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for the bandit linear optimization problem which √ ˜ obtains a tighter regret bound of O( Q), where Q is the total variation in the cost functions. This regret bound, previously conjectured to hold in the full information case, shows that it is possible to incur much less regret in a slowly changing environment even in the bandit setting. Our algorithm is efﬁcient and applies several new ideas to bandit optimization such as reservoir sampling.

<p>Author: Jim C. Huang, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: We present a class of graphical models for directly representing the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) of many random variables, called cumulative distribution networks (CDNs). Unlike graphs for probability density and mass functions, for CDFs the marginal probabilities for any subset of variables are obtained by computing limits of functions in the model, and conditional probabilities correspond to computing mixed derivatives. We will show that the conditional independence properties in a CDN are distinct from the conditional independence properties of directed, undirected and factor graphs, but include the conditional independence properties of bi-directed graphs. In order to perform inference in such models, we describe the ‘derivative-sum-product’ (DSP) message-passing algorithm in which messages correspond to derivatives of the joint CDF. We will then apply CDNs to the problem of learning to rank players in multiplayer team-based games and suggest several future directions for research.

<p>Author: John Duchi, Elad Hazan, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to ﬁnd needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efﬁcient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.

Instead of only assigning a ﬁxed weight to the misclassiﬁed example received at the current trial, the proposed online learning algorithm also tries to update the weight for one of the existing support vectors. We show that the mistake bound can be improved by the proposed online learning method. We conduct an extensive set of empirical evaluations for both binary and multi-class online learning tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed technique is considerably more effective than the state-of-the-art online learning algorithms.

<p>Author: Paramveer S. Dhillon, Dean Foster, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework MIC (Multiple Inclusion Criterion) for learning sparse models based on the information theoretic Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. MIC provides an elegant way of incorporating arbitrary sparsity patterns in the feature space by using two-part MDL coding schemes. We present MIC based models for the problems of grouped feature selection (MICG ROUP) and multi-task feature selection (MIC-M ULTI). MIC-G ROUP assumes that the features are divided into groups and induces two level sparsity, selecting a subset of the feature groups, and also selecting features within each selected group. MIC-M ULTI applies when there are multiple related tasks that share the same set of potentially predictive features. It also induces two level sparsity, selecting a subset of the features, and then selecting which of the tasks each feature should be added to. Lastly, we propose a model, T RANS F EAT, that can be used to transfer knowledge from a set of previously learned tasks to a new task that is expected to share similar features. All three methods are designed for selecting a small set of predictive features from a large pool of candidate features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with experimental results on data from genomics and from word sense disambiguation problems.1 Keywords: feature selection, minimum description length principle, multi-task learning</p><p>3 0.86336422 <a title="28-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2011-Convex_and_Network_Flow_Optimization_for_Structured_Sparsity.html">20 jmlr-2011-Convex and Network Flow Optimization for Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Rodolphe Jenatton, Guillaume Obozinski, Francis Bach</p><p>Abstract: We consider a class of learning problems regularized by a structured sparsity-inducing norm deﬁned as the sum of ℓ2 - or ℓ∞ -norms over groups of variables. Whereas much effort has been put in developing fast optimization techniques when the groups are disjoint or embedded in a hierarchy, we address here the case of general overlapping groups. To this end, we present two different strategies: On the one hand, we show that the proximal operator associated with a sum of ℓ∞ norms can be computed exactly in polynomial time by solving a quadratic min-cost ﬂow problem, allowing the use of accelerated proximal gradient methods. On the other hand, we use proximal splitting techniques, and address an equivalent formulation with non-overlapping groups, but in higher dimension and with additional constraints. We propose efﬁcient and scalable algorithms exploiting these two strategies, which are signiﬁcantly faster than alternative approaches. We illustrate these methods with several problems such as CUR matrix factorization, multi-task learning of tree-structured dictionaries, background subtraction in video sequences, image denoising with wavelets, and topographic dictionary learning of natural image patches.

<p>Author: Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: A multitask learning framework is developed for discriminative classiﬁcation and regression where multiple large-margin linear classiﬁers are estimated for different prediction problems. These classiﬁers operate in a common input space but are coupled as they recover an unknown shared representation. A maximum entropy discrimination (MED) framework is used to derive the multitask algorithm which involves only convex optimization problems that are straightforward to implement. Three multitask scenarios are described. The ﬁrst multitask method produces multiple support vector machines that learn a shared sparse feature selection over the input space. The second multitask method produces multiple support vector machines that learn a shared conic kernel combination. The third multitask method produces a pooled classiﬁer as well as adaptively specialized individual classiﬁers. Furthermore, extensions to regression, graphical model structure estimation and other sparse methods are discussed. The maximum entropy optimization problems are implemented via a sequential quadratic programming method which leverages recent progress in fast SVM solvers. Fast monotonic convergence bounds are provided by bounding the MED sparsifying cost function with a quadratic function and ensuring only a constant factor runtime increase above standard independent SVM solvers. Results are shown on multitask data sets and favor multitask learning over single-task or tabula rasa methods.

<p>Author: Junzhou Huang, Tong Zhang, Dimitris Metaxas</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates a learning formulation called structured sparsity, which is a natural extension of the standard sparsity concept in statistical learning and compressive sensing. By allowing arbitrary structures on the feature set, this concept generalizes the group sparsity idea that has become popular in recent years. A general theory is developed for learning with structured sparsity, based on the notion of coding complexity associated with the structure. It is shown that if the coding complexity of the target signal is small, then one can achieve improved performance by using coding complexity regularization methods, which generalize the standard sparse regularization. Moreover, a structured greedy algorithm is proposed to efﬁciently solve the structured sparsity problem. It is shown that the greedy algorithm approximately solves the coding complexity optimization problem under appropriate conditions. Experiments are included to demonstrate the advantage of structured sparsity over standard sparsity on some real applications.

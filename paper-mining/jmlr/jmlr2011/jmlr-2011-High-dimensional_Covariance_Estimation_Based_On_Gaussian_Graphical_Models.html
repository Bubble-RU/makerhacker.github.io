<p>Author: Jérémie Bigot, Rolando J. Biscay, Jean-Michel Loubes, Lillian Muñiz-Alvarez</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Group Lasso estimator of the covariance matrix of a stochastic process corrupted by an additive noise. We propose to estimate the covariance matrix in a highdimensional setting under the assumption that the process has a sparse representation in a large dictionary of basis functions. Using a matrix regression model, we propose a new methodology for high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation based on empirical contrast regularization by a group Lasso penalty. Using such a penalty, the method selects a sparse set of basis functions in the dictionary used to approximate the process, leading to an approximation of the covariance matrix into a low dimensional space. Consistency of the estimator is studied in Frobenius and operator norms and an application to sparse PCA is proposed.

<p>Author: Han Liu, Min Xu, Haijie Gu, Anupam Gupta, John Lafferty, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: We study graph estimation and density estimation in high dimensions, using a family of density estimators based on forest structured undirected graphical models. For density estimation, we do not assume the true distribution corresponds to a forest; rather, we form kernel density estimates of the bivariate and univariate marginals, and apply Kruskal’s algorithm to estimate the optimal forest on held out data. We prove an oracle inequality on the excess risk of the resulting estimator relative to the risk of the best forest. For graph estimation, we consider the problem of estimating forests with restricted tree sizes. We prove that ﬁnding a maximum weight spanning forest with restricted tree size is NP-hard, and develop an approximation algorithm for this problem. Viewing the tree size as a complexity parameter, we then select a forest using data splitting, and prove bounds on excess risk and structure selection consistency of the procedure. Experiments with simulated data and microarray data indicate that the methods are a practical alternative to Gaussian graphical models.

<p>Author: Krishnakumar Balasubramanian, Pinar Donmez, Guy Lebanon</p><p>Abstract: Many popular linear classiﬁers, such as logistic regression, boosting, or SVM, are trained by optimizing a margin-based risk function. Traditionally, these risk functions are computed based on a labeled data set. We develop a novel technique for estimating such risks using only unlabeled data and the marginal label distribution. We prove that the proposed risk estimator is consistent on high-dimensional data sets and demonstrate it on synthetic and real-world data. In particular, we show how the estimate is used for evaluating classiﬁers in transfer learning, and for training classiﬁers with no labeled data whatsoever.

As an example, structural constraints are used to map the problem of structure learning in Dynamic Bayesian networks into a corresponding augmented Bayesian network. Finally, we show empirically the beneﬁts of using the properties with state-of-the-art methods and with the new algorithm, which is able to handle larger data sets than before.

<p>Author: Jérémie Bigot, Rolando J. Biscay, Jean-Michel Loubes, Lillian Muñiz-Alvarez</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Group Lasso estimator of the covariance matrix of a stochastic process corrupted by an additive noise. We propose to estimate the covariance matrix in a highdimensional setting under the assumption that the process has a sparse representation in a large dictionary of basis functions. Using a matrix regression model, we propose a new methodology for high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation based on empirical contrast regularization by a group Lasso penalty. Using such a penalty, the method selects a sparse set of basis functions in the dictionary used to approximate the process, leading to an approximation of the covariance matrix into a low dimensional space. Consistency of the estimator is studied in Frobenius and operator norms and an application to sparse PCA is proposed.

<p>Author: Piotr Zwiernik</p><p>Abstract: The standard Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is derived under regularity conditions which are not always satisÄ?Ĺš ed in the case of graphical models with hidden variables. In this paper we derive the BIC for the binary graphical tree models where all the inner nodes of a tree represent binary hidden variables. This provides an extension of a similar formula given by Rusakov and Geiger for naive Bayes models. The main tool used in this paper is the connection between the growth behavior of marginal likelihood integrals and the real log-canonical threshold.

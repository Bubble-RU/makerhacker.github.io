<p>Author: Özgür Sümer, Umut A. Acar, Alexander T. Ihler, Ramgopal R. Mettu</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms and applications involve repeatedly solving variations of the same inference problem, for example to introduce new evidence to the model or to change conditional dependencies. As the model is updated, the goal of adaptive inference is to take advantage of previously computed quantities to perform inference more rapidly than from scratch. In this paper, we present algorithms for adaptive exact inference on general graphs that can be used to efﬁciently compute marginals and update MAP conﬁgurations under arbitrary changes to the input factor graph and its associated elimination tree. After a linear time preprocessing step, our approach enables updates to the model and the computation of any marginal in time that is logarithmic in the size of the input model. Moreover, in contrast to max-product our approach can also be used to update MAP conﬁgurations in time that is roughly proportional to the number of updated entries, rather than the size of the input model. To evaluate the practical effectiveness of our algorithms, we implement and test them using synthetic data as well as for two real-world computational biology applications. Our experiments show that adaptive inference can achieve substantial speedups over performing complete inference as the model undergoes small changes over time.

<p>Author: Antti Ukkonen</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of clustering a set of chains to k clusters. A chain is a totally ordered subset of a ﬁnite set of items. Chains are an intuitive way to express preferences over a set of alternatives, as well as a useful representation of ratings in situations where the item-speciﬁc scores are either difﬁcult to obtain, too noisy due to measurement error, or simply not as relevant as the order that they induce over the items. First we adapt the classical k-means for chains by proposing a suitable distance function and a centroid structure. We also present two different approaches for mapping chains to a vector space. The ﬁrst one is related to the planted partition model, while the second one has an intuitive geometrical interpretation. Finally we discuss a randomization test for assessing the signiﬁcance of a clustering. To this end we present an MCMC algorithm for sampling random sets of chains that share certain properties with the original data. The methods are studied in a series of experiments using real and artiﬁcial data. Results indicate that the methods produce interesting clusterings, and for certain types of inputs improve upon previous work on clustering algorithms for orders.

<p>Author: Vianney Perchet</p><p>Abstract: We provide consistent random algorithms for sequential decision under partial monitoring, when the decision maker does not observe the outcomes but receives instead random feedback signals. Those algorithms have no internal regret in the sense that, on the set of stages where the decision maker chose his action according to a given law, the average payoff could not have been improved in average by using any other ﬁxed law. They are based on a generalization of calibration, no longer deﬁned in terms of a Vorono¨ ı diagram but instead of a Laguerre diagram (a more general concept). This allows us to bound, for the ﬁrst time in this general framework, the expected average internal, as well as the usual external, regret at stage n by O(n−1/3 ), which is known to be optimal.

<p>Author: Bruno Pelletier, Pierre Pudlo</p><p>Abstract: Following Hartigan (1975), a cluster is deﬁned as a connected component of the t-level set of the underlying density, that is, the set of points for which the density is greater than t. A clustering algorithm which combines a density estimate with spectral clustering techniques is proposed. Our algorithm is composed of two steps. First, a nonparametric density estimate is used to extract the data points for which the estimated density takes a value greater than t. Next, the extracted points are clustered based on the eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian matrix. Under mild assumptions, we prove the almost sure convergence in operator norm of the empirical graph Laplacian operator associated with the algorithm. Furthermore, we give the typical behavior of the representation of the data set into the feature space, which establishes the strong consistency of our proposed algorithm.

All four multi-class support vector machines (M-SVMs) proposed so far in the literature appear as instances of this model. MSVMpack provides for them the ﬁrst uniﬁed implementation and offers a convenient basis to develop other instances. This is also the ﬁrst parallel implementation for M-SVMs. The package consists in a set of command-line tools with a callable library.

<p>Author: David M. Blei, Peter I. Frazier</p><p>Abstract: We develop the distance dependent Chinese restaurant process, a ﬂexible class of distributions over partitions that allows for dependencies between the elements. This class can be used to model many kinds of dependencies between data in inﬁnite clustering models, including dependencies arising from time, space, and network connectivity. We examine the properties of the distance dependent CRP, discuss its connections to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models, and derive a Gibbs sampler for both fully observed and latent mixture settings. We study its empirical performance with three text corpora. We show that relaxing the assumption of exchangeability with distance dependent CRPs can provide a better ﬁt to sequential data and network data.

<p>Author: Myung Jin Choi, Vincent Y. F. Tan, Animashree Anandkumar, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a latent tree graphical model where samples are available only from a subset of variables. We propose two consistent and computationally efﬁcient algorithms for learning minimal latent trees, that is, trees without any redundant hidden nodes. Unlike many existing methods, the observed nodes (or variables) are not constrained to be leaf nodes. Our algorithms can be applied to both discrete and Gaussian random variables and our learned models are such that all the observed and latent variables have the same domain (state space). Our ﬁrst algorithm, recursive grouping, builds the latent tree recursively by identifying sibling groups using so-called information distances. One of the main contributions of this work is our second algorithm, which we refer to as CLGrouping. CLGrouping starts with a pre-processing procedure in which a tree over the observed variables is constructed. This global step groups the observed nodes that are likely to be close to each other in the true latent tree, thereby guiding subsequent recursive grouping (or equivalent procedures such as neighbor-joining) on much smaller subsets of variables. This results in more accurate and efﬁcient learning of latent trees. We also present regularized versions of our algorithms that learn latent tree approximations of arbitrary distributions. We compare the proposed algorithms to other methods by performing extensive numerical experiments on various latent tree graphical models such as hidden Markov models and star graphs. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of our methods on real-world data sets by modeling the dependency structure of monthly stock returns in the S&P; index and of the words in the 20 newsgroups data set.

<p>Author: Sharon Goldwater, Thomas L. Griffiths, Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Standard statistical models of language fail to capture one of the most striking properties of natural languages: the power-law distribution in the frequencies of word tokens. We present a framework for developing statistical models that can generically produce power laws, breaking generative models into two stages. The ﬁrst stage, the generator, can be any standard probabilistic model, while the second stage, the adaptor, transforms the word frequencies of this model to provide a closer match to natural language. We show that two commonly used Bayesian models, the Dirichlet-multinomial model and the Dirichlet process, can be viewed as special cases of our framework. We discuss two stochastic processes—the Chinese restaurant process and its two-parameter generalization based on the Pitman-Yor process—that can be used as adaptors in our framework to produce power-law distributions over word frequencies. We show that these adaptors justify common estimation procedures based on logarithmic or inverse-power transformations of empirical frequencies. In addition, taking the Pitman-Yor Chinese restaurant process as an adaptor justiﬁes the appearance of type frequencies in formal analyses of natural language and improves the performance of a model for unsupervised learning of morphology.

<p>Author: Lauren A. Hannah, David M. Blei, Warren B. Powell</p><p>Abstract: We propose Dirichlet Process mixtures of Generalized Linear Models (DP-GLM), a new class of methods for nonparametric regression. Given a data set of input-response pairs, the DP-GLM produces a global model of the joint distribution through a mixture of local generalized linear models. DP-GLMs allow both continuous and categorical inputs, and can model the same class of responses that can be modeled with a generalized linear model. We study the properties of the DP-GLM, and show why it provides better predictions and density estimates than existing Dirichlet process mixture regression models. We give conditions for weak consistency of the joint distribution and pointwise consistency of the regression estimate.

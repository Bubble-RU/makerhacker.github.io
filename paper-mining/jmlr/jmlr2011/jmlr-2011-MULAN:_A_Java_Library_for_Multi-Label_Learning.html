It offers a variety of classiﬁcation, ranking, thresholding and dimensionality reduction algorithms, as well as algorithms for learning from hierarchically structured labels. In addition, it contains an evaluation framework that calculates a rich variety of performance measures. Keywords: multi-label data, classiﬁcation, ranking, thresholding, dimensionality reduction, hierarchical classiﬁcation, evaluation 1. Multi-Label Learning A multi-label data set consists of training examples that are associated with a subset of a ﬁnite set of labels. Nowadays, multi-label data are becoming ubiquitous. They arise in an increasing number and diversity of applications, such as semantic annotation of images and video, web page categorization, direct marketing, functional genomics and music categorization into genres and emotions. There exist two major multi-label learning tasks (Tsoumakas et al., 2010): multi-label classiﬁcation and label ranking. The former is concerned with learning a model that outputs a bipartition of the set of labels into relevant and irrelevant with respect to a query instance. The latter is concerned with learning a model that outputs a ranking of the labels according to their relevance to a query instance. Some algorithms learn models that serve both tasks. Several algorithms learn models that primarily output a vector of numerical scores, one for each label. This vector is then converted to a ranking after solving ties, or to a bipartition, after thresholding (Ioannou et al., 2010). Multi-label learning methods addressing these tasks can be grouped into two categories (Tsoumakas et al., 2010): problem transformation and algorithm adaptation. The ﬁrst group of methods are algorithm independent. They transform the learning task into one or more singlelabel classiﬁcation tasks, for which a large body of learning algorithms exists. The second group of methods extend speciﬁc learning algorithms in order to handle multi-label data directly. There exist extensions of decision tree learners, nearest neighbor classiﬁers, neural networks, ensemble methods, support vector machines, kernel methods, genetic algorithms and others. Multi-label learning stretches across several other tasks. When labels are structured as a treeshaped hierarchy or a directed acyclic graph, then we have the interesting task of hierarchical multilabel learning. Dimensionality reduction is another important task for multi-label data, as it is for c 2011 Grigorios Tsoumakas, Eleftherios Spyromitros-Xiouﬁs, Jozef Vilcek and Ioannis Vlahavas. T SOUMAKAS , S PYROMITROS -X IOUFIS , V ILCEK AND V LAHAVAS any kind of data. When bags of instances are used to represent a training object, then multi-instance multi-label learning algorithms are required. There also exist semi-supervised learning and active learning algorithms for multi-label data. 2. The M ULAN Library The main goal of M ULAN is to bring the beneﬁts of machine learning open source software (MLOSS) (Sonnenburg et al., 2007) to people working with multi-label data. The availability of MLOSS is especially important in emerging areas like multi-label learning, because it removes the burden of implementing related work and speeds up the scientiﬁc progress. In multi-label learning, an extra burden is implementing appropriate evaluation measures, since these are different compared to traditional supervised learning tasks. Evaluating multi-label algorithms with a variety of measures, is considered important by the community, due to the different types of output (bipartition, ranking) and diverse applications. Towards this goal, M ULAN offers a plethora of state-of-the-art algorithms for multi-label classiﬁcation and label ranking and an evaluation framework that computes a large variety of multi-label evaluation measures through hold-out evaluation and cross-validation. In addition, the library offers a number of thresholding strategies that produce bipartitions from score vectors, simple baseline methods for multi-label dimensionality reduction and support for hierarchical multi-label classiﬁcation, including an implemented algorithm. M ULAN is a library. As such, it offers only programmatic API to the library users. There is no graphical user interface (GUI) available. The possibility to use the library via command line, is also currently not supported. Another drawback of M ULAN is that it runs everything in main memory so there exist limitations with very large data sets. M ULAN is written in Java and is built on top of Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005). This choice was made in order to take advantage of the vast resources of Weka on supervised learning algorithms, since many state-of-the-art multi-label learning algorithms are based on problem transformation. The fact that several machine learning researchers and practitioners are familiar with Weka was another reason for this choice. However, many aspects of the library are independent of Weka and there are interfaces for most of the core classes. M ULAN is an advocate of open science in general. One of the unique features of the library is a recently introduced experiments package, whose goal is to host code that reproduces experimental results reported on published papers on multi-label learning. To the best of our knowledge, most of the general learning platforms, like Weka, don’t support multi-label data. There are currently only a number of implementations of speciﬁc multi-label learning algorithms, but not a general library like M ULAN. 3. Using M ULAN This section presents an example of how to setup an experiment for empirically evaluating two multi-label algorithms on a multi-label data set using cross-validation. We create a new Java class for this experiment, which we call MulanExp1.java. The ﬁrst thing to do is load the multi-label data set that will be used for the empirical evaluation. M ULAN requires two text ﬁles for the speciﬁcation of a data set. The ﬁrst one is in the ARFF format of Weka. The labels should be speciﬁed as nominal attributes with values “0” and “1” indicating 2412 M ULAN : A JAVA L IBRARY FOR M ULTI -L ABEL L EARNING absence and presence of the label respectively.

Its ﬁrst principal contribution is a scalable network library supporting highperformance implementations of the most commonly employed unsupervised link prediction methods. Link prediction in longitudinal data requires a sophisticated and disciplined procedure for correct results and fair evaluation, so the second principle contribution of LPmade is a sophisticated GNU make architecture that completely automates link prediction, prediction evaluation, and network analysis. Finally, LPmade streamlines and automates the procedure for creating multivariate supervised link prediction models with a version of WEKA modiﬁed to operate effectively on extremely large data sets. With mere minutes of manual work, one may start with a raw stream of records representing a network and progress through hundreds of steps to generate plots, gigabytes or terabytes of output, and actionable or publishable results.

Multi-Label Learning A multi-label data set consists of training examples that are associated with a subset of a ﬁnite set of labels. Nowadays, multi-label data are becoming ubiquitous. They arise in an increasing number and diversity of applications, such as semantic annotation of images and video, web page categorization, direct marketing, functional genomics and music categorization into genres and emotions. There exist two major multi-label learning tasks (Tsoumakas et al., 2010): multi-label classiﬁcation and label ranking.

This vector is then converted to a ranking after solving ties, or to a bipartition, after thresholding (Ioannou et al., 2010). Multi-label learning methods addressing these tasks can be grouped into two categories (Tsoumakas et al., 2010): problem transformation and algorithm adaptation.

<p>Author: Ryan N. Lichtenwalter, Nitesh V. Chawla</p><p>Abstract: LPmade is a complete cross-platform software solution for multi-core link prediction and related tasks and analysis. Its ﬁrst principal contribution is a scalable network library supporting highperformance implementations of the most commonly employed unsupervised link prediction methods. Link prediction in longitudinal data requires a sophisticated and disciplined procedure for correct results and fair evaluation, so the second principle contribution of LPmade is a sophisticated GNU make architecture that completely automates link prediction, prediction evaluation, and network analysis. Finally, LPmade streamlines and automates the procedure for creating multivariate supervised link prediction models with a version of WEKA modiﬁed to operate effectively on extremely large data sets. With mere minutes of manual work, one may start with a raw stream of records representing a network and progress through hundreds of steps to generate plots, gigabytes or terabytes of output, and actionable or publishable results.

<p>Author: Timothee Cour, Ben Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of partially-labeled multiclass classiﬁcation, where instead of a single label per instance, the algorithm is given a candidate set of labels, only one of which is correct. Our setting is motivated by a common scenario in many image and video collections, where only partial access to labels is available. The goal is to learn a classiﬁer that can disambiguate the partiallylabeled training instances, and generalize to unseen data. We deﬁne an intuitive property of the data distribution that sharply characterizes the ability to learn in this setting and show that effective learning is possible even when all the data is only partially labeled. Exploiting this property of the data, we propose a convex learning formulation based on minimization of a loss function appropriate for the partial label setting. We analyze the conditions under which our loss function is asymptotically consistent, as well as its generalization and transductive performance. We apply our framework to identifying faces culled from web news sources and to naming characters in TV series and movies; in particular, we annotated and experimented on a very large video data set and achieve 6% error for character naming on 16 episodes of the TV series Lost.

<p>Author: Şeyda Ertekin, Cynthia Rudin</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate that there are machine learning algorithms that can achieve success for two separate tasks simultaneously, namely the tasks of classiﬁcation and bipartite ranking. This means that advantages gained from solving one task can be carried over to the other task, such as the ability to obtain conditional density estimates, and an order-of-magnitude reduction in computational time for training the algorithm. It also means that some algorithms are robust to the choice of evaluation metric used; they can theoretically perform well when performance is measured either by a misclassiﬁcation error or by a statistic of the ROC curve (such as the area under the curve). Speciﬁcally, we provide such an equivalence relationship between a generalization of Freund et al.’s RankBoost algorithm, called the “P-Norm Push,” and a particular cost-sensitive classiﬁcation algorithm that generalizes AdaBoost, which we call “P-Classiﬁcation.” We discuss and validate the potential beneﬁts of this equivalence relationship, and perform controlled experiments to understand P-Classiﬁcation’s empirical performance. There is no established equivalence relationship for logistic regression and its ranking counterpart, so we introduce a logistic-regression-style algorithm that aims in between classiﬁcation and ranking, and has promising experimental performance with respect to both tasks.

<p>Author: Liwei Wang, Masashi Sugiyama, Zhaoxiang Jing, Cheng Yang, Zhi-Hua Zhou, Jufu Feng</p><p>Abstract: Much attention has been paid to the theoretical explanation of the empirical success of AdaBoost. The most inﬂuential work is the margin theory, which is essentially an upper bound for the generalization error of any voting classiﬁer in terms of the margin distribution over the training data. However, important questions were raised about the margin explanation. Breiman (1999) proved a bound in terms of the minimum margin, which is sharper than the margin distribution bound. He argued that the minimum margin would be better in predicting the generalization error. Grove and Schuurmans (1998) developed an algorithm called LP-AdaBoost which maximizes the minimum margin while keeping all other factors the same as AdaBoost. In experiments however, LP-AdaBoost usually performs worse than AdaBoost, putting the margin explanation into serious doubt. In this paper, we make a reﬁned analysis of the margin theory. We prove a bound in terms of a new margin measure called the Equilibrium margin (Emargin). The Emargin bound is uniformly ©2011 Liwei Wang, Masashi Sugiyama, Zhaoxiang Jing, Cheng Yang, Zhi-Hua Zhou and Jufu Feng. WANG , S UGIYAMA , J ING , YANG , Z HOU AND F ENG sharper than Breiman’s minimum margin bound. Thus our result suggests that the minimum margin may be not crucial for the generalization error. We also show that a large Emargin and a small empirical error at Emargin imply a smaller bound of the generalization error. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate that AdaBoost usually has a larger Emargin and a smaller test error than LP-AdaBoost, which agrees well with our theory.

<p>Author: Alexandra M. Carvalho, Teemu Roos, Arlindo L. Oliveira, Petri Myllymäki</p><p>Abstract: We propose an efﬁcient and parameter-free scoring criterion, the factorized conditional log-likelihood (ˆ fCLL), for learning Bayesian network classiﬁers. The proposed score is an approximation of the conditional log-likelihood criterion. The approximation is devised in order to guarantee decomposability over the network structure, as well as efﬁcient estimation of the optimal parameters, achieving the same time and space complexity as the traditional log-likelihood scoring criterion. The resulting criterion has an information-theoretic interpretation based on interaction information, which exhibits its discriminative nature. To evaluate the performance of the proposed criterion, we present an empirical comparison with state-of-the-art classiﬁers. Results on a large suite of benchmark data sets from the UCI repository show that ˆ fCLL-trained classiﬁers achieve at least as good accuracy as the best compared classiﬁers, using signiﬁcantly less computational resources.

<p>Author: Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: We unify f -divergences, Bregman divergences, surrogate regret bounds, proper scoring rules, cost curves, ROC-curves and statistical information. We do this by systematically studying integral and variational representations of these objects and in so doing identify their representation primitives which all are related to cost-sensitive binary classiﬁcation. As well as developing relationships between generative and discriminative views of learning, the new machinery leads to tight and more general surrogate regret bounds and generalised Pinsker inequalities relating f -divergences to variational divergence. The new viewpoint also illuminates existing algorithms: it provides a new derivation of Support Vector Machines in terms of divergences and relates maximum mean discrepancy to Fisher linear discriminants.

<p>Author: Vincent Y.F. Tan, Animashree Anandkumar, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning forest-structured discrete graphical models from i.i.d. samples is considered. An algorithm based on pruning of the Chow-Liu tree through adaptive thresholding is proposed. It is shown that this algorithm is both structurally consistent and risk consistent and the error probability of structure learning decays faster than any polynomial in the number of samples under ﬁxed model size. For the high-dimensional scenario where the size of the model d and the number of edges k scale with the number of samples n, sufﬁcient conditions on (n, d, k) are given for the algorithm to satisfy structural and risk consistencies. In addition, the extremal structures for learning are identiﬁed; we prove that the independent (resp., tree) model is the hardest (resp., easiest) to learn using the proposed algorithm in terms of error rates for structure learning.

<p>Author: Krishnakumar Balasubramanian, Pinar Donmez, Guy Lebanon</p><p>Abstract: Many popular linear classiﬁers, such as logistic regression, boosting, or SVM, are trained by optimizing a margin-based risk function. Traditionally, these risk functions are computed based on a labeled data set. We develop a novel technique for estimating such risks using only unlabeled data and the marginal label distribution. We prove that the proposed risk estimator is consistent on high-dimensional data sets and demonstrate it on synthetic and real-world data. In particular, we show how the estimate is used for evaluating classiﬁers in transfer learning, and for training classiﬁers with no labeled data whatsoever.

<p>Author: Brian McFee, Gert Lanckriet</p><p>Abstract: In many applications involving multi-media data, the deﬁnition of similarity between items is integral to several key tasks, including nearest-neighbor retrieval, classiﬁcation, and recommendation. Data in such regimes typically exhibits multiple modalities, such as acoustic and visual content of video. Integrating such heterogeneous data to form a holistic similarity space is therefore a key challenge to be overcome in many real-world applications. We present a novel multiple kernel learning technique for integrating heterogeneous data into a single, uniﬁed similarity space. Our algorithm learns an optimal ensemble of kernel transformations which conform to measurements of human perceptual similarity, as expressed by relative comparisons. To cope with the ubiquitous problems of subjectivity and inconsistency in multimedia similarity, we develop graph-based techniques to ﬁlter similarity measurements, resulting in a simpliﬁed and robust training procedure.

<p>Author: Özgür Sümer, Umut A. Acar, Alexander T. Ihler, Ramgopal R. Mettu</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms and applications involve repeatedly solving variations of the same inference problem, for example to introduce new evidence to the model or to change conditional dependencies. As the model is updated, the goal of adaptive inference is to take advantage of previously computed quantities to perform inference more rapidly than from scratch. In this paper, we present algorithms for adaptive exact inference on general graphs that can be used to efﬁciently compute marginals and update MAP conﬁgurations under arbitrary changes to the input factor graph and its associated elimination tree. After a linear time preprocessing step, our approach enables updates to the model and the computation of any marginal in time that is logarithmic in the size of the input model. Moreover, in contrast to max-product our approach can also be used to update MAP conﬁgurations in time that is roughly proportional to the number of updated entries, rather than the size of the input model. To evaluate the practical effectiveness of our algorithms, we implement and test them using synthetic data as well as for two real-world computational biology applications. Our experiments show that adaptive inference can achieve substantial speedups over performing complete inference as the model undergoes small changes over time.

<p>Author: Lu Ren, Lan Du, Lawrence Carin, David Dunson</p><p>Abstract: A logistic stick-breaking process (LSBP) is proposed for non-parametric clustering of general spatially- or temporally-dependent data, imposing the belief that proximate data are more likely to be clustered together. The sticks in the LSBP are realized via multiple logistic regression functions, with shrinkage priors employed to favor contiguous and spatially localized segments. The LSBP is also extended for the simultaneous processing of multiple data sets, yielding a hierarchical logistic stick-breaking process (H-LSBP). The model parameters (atoms) within the H-LSBP are shared across the multiple learning tasks. Efﬁcient variational Bayesian inference is derived, and comparisons are made to related techniques in the literature. Experimental analysis is performed for audio waveforms and images, and it is demonstrated that for segmentation applications the LSBP yields generally homogeneous segments with sharp boundaries.

<p>Author: Mark D. Reid, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: We unify f -divergences, Bregman divergences, surrogate regret bounds, proper scoring rules, cost curves, ROC-curves and statistical information. We do this by systematically studying integral and variational representations of these objects and in so doing identify their representation primitives which all are related to cost-sensitive binary classiﬁcation. As well as developing relationships between generative and discriminative views of learning, the new machinery leads to tight and more general surrogate regret bounds and generalised Pinsker inequalities relating f -divergences to variational divergence. The new viewpoint also illuminates existing algorithms: it provides a new derivation of Support Vector Machines in terms of divergences and relates maximum mean discrepancy to Fisher linear discriminants.

<p>Author: Lucas Theis, Sebastian Gerwinn, Fabian Sinz, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: Statistical models of natural images provide an important tool for researchers in the ﬁelds of machine learning and computational neuroscience. The canonical measure to quantitatively assess and compare the performance of statistical models is given by the likelihood. One class of statistical models which has recently gained increasing popularity and has been applied to a variety of complex data is formed by deep belief networks. Analyses of these models, however, have often been limited to qualitative analyses based on samples due to the computationally intractable nature of their likelihood. Motivated by these circumstances, the present article introduces a consistent estimator for the likelihood of deep belief networks which is computationally tractable and simple to apply in practice. Using this estimator, we quantitatively investigate a deep belief network for natural image patches and compare its performance to the performance of other models for natural image patches. We ﬁnd that the deep belief network is outperformed with respect to the likelihood even by very simple mixture models.

In addition, we show how this approach can be scaled to solve the semi-supervised learning problem on very large data sets, for example, in one instance we use a data set with over 108 samples. In this context, we propose a graph node ordering algorithm that is also applicable to other graph-based semi-supervised learning approaches. We compare the proposed approach against other standard semi-supervised learning algorithms on the semi-supervised learning benchmark data sets (Chapelle et al., 2007), and other real-world tasks such as text classiﬁcation on Reuters and WebKB, speech phone classiﬁcation on TIMIT and Switchboard, and linguistic dialog-act tagging on Dihana and Switchboard. In each case, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art. Lastly, we show that our objective can be generalized into a form that includes the standard squared-error loss, and we prove a geometric rate of convergence in that case.

<p>Author: Jonathan Aflalo, Aharon Ben-Tal, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Jagarlapudi Saketha Nath, Sankaran Raman</p><p>Abstract: paper1 This presents novel algorithms and applications for a particular class of mixed-norm regularization based Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) formulations. The formulations assume that the given kernels are grouped and employ l1 norm regularization for promoting sparsity within RKHS norms of each group and ls , s ≥ 2 norm regularization for promoting non-sparse combinations across groups. Various sparsity levels in combining the kernels can be achieved by varying the grouping of kernels—hence we name the formulations as Variable Sparsity Kernel Learning (VSKL) formulations. While previous attempts have a non-convex formulation, here we present a convex formulation which admits efﬁcient Mirror-Descent (MD) based solving techniques. The proposed MD based algorithm optimizes over product of simplices and has a computational complexity of O m2 ntot log nmax /ε2 where m is no. training data points, nmax , ntot are the maximum no. kernels in any group, total no. kernels respectively and ε is the error in approximating the objective. A detailed proof of convergence of the algorithm is also presented. Experimental results show that the VSKL formulations are well-suited for multi-modal learning tasks like object categorization. Results also show that the MD based algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art MKL solvers in terms of computational efﬁciency. Keywords: multiple kernel learning, mirror descent, mixed-norm, object categorization, scalability 1. All authors contributed equally.

<p>Author: Graham W. Taylor, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop a class of nonlinear generative models for high-dimensional time series. We ﬁrst propose a model based on the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that uses an undirected model with binary latent variables and real-valued “visible” variables. The latent and visible variables at each time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last few time-steps. This “conditional” RBM (CRBM) makes on-line inference efﬁcient and allows us to use a simple approximate learning procedure. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various sequences from a model trained on motion capture data and by performing on-line ﬁlling in of data lost during capture. We extend the CRBM in a way that preserves its most important computational properties and introduces multiplicative three-way interactions that allow the effective interaction weight between two variables to be modulated by the dynamic state of a third variable. We introduce a factoring of the implied three-way weight tensor to permit a more compact parameterization. The resulting model can capture diverse styles of motion with a single set of parameters, and the three-way interactions greatly improve its ability to blend motion styles or to transition smoothly among them.

<p>Author: Grégoire Montavon, Mikio L. Braun, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: When training deep networks it is common knowledge that an efﬁcient and well generalizing representation of the problem is formed. In this paper we aim to elucidate what makes the emerging representation successful. We analyze the layer-wise evolution of the representation in a deep network by building a sequence of deeper and deeper kernels that subsume the mapping performed by more and more layers of the deep network and measuring how these increasingly complex kernels ﬁt the learning problem. We observe that deep networks create increasingly better representations of the learning problem and that the structure of the deep network controls how fast the representation of the task is formed layer after layer.

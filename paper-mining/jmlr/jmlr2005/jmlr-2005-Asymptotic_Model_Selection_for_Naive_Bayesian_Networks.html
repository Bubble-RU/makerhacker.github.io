</p><p>2 This claim stands in contrast to linear and curved exponential families, where the BIC score has been proven to provide a correct asymptotic approximation for the marginal likelihood. [sent-10, score-0.364]
</p><p>3 The quantity represented by S(N,YD , M) ≡ ln I[N,YD , M] is called the BIC score of model M. [sent-27, score-0.445]
</p><p>4 It was shown that S(N,YD , M) = N · ln P(YD |ωML ) −  d ln N + R, 2  (2)  where ln P(YD |ωML ) is the log-likelihood of YD given the maximum likelihood parameters of the model and d is the model dimension, i. [sent-31, score-1.109]
</p><p>5 Moreover, no uniform score formula exists for such models; our adjusted BIC score changes depending on the different types of singularities of the sufﬁcient statistics, namely, the coefﬁcient of the ln N term (Eq. [sent-61, score-0.622]

</p><p>10 The resolution of singularities in algebraic geometry transforms the integral J(λ) into a direct product of integrals of a single variable. [sent-151, score-0.363]

[sent-340, score-3.586]
</p><p>18 In contrast to the standard BIC score, which is uniform for all points YD , the asymptotic approximation given by our adjusted BIC score depends on the value of Y = YD through the coefﬁcient of ln N. [sent-350, score-0.617]
</p><p>19 Another attempt is to claim that the coefﬁcient of − ln N is half the number of parameters in the naive Bayesian model minus the number of redundant parameters in the model that generates YD . [sent-356, score-0.605]
</p><p>20 The next theorem speciﬁes the asymptotic behavior of marginal likelihood integrals for degenerate naive Bayesian models, namely, when some of the links are missing. [sent-361, score-0.585]

</p><p>22 Furthermore, for m = n − 2 (d) If k = 2 (type 1 singularity) ln I[N,YD ] = N ln P(Y |ωML ) −  n+1 ln N + O(1). [sent-393, score-0.978]
</p><p>23 (e) If k = 0 or k = 1 (type 2 singularity) ln I[N,YD ] = N ln P(Y |ωML ) −  n+1 ln N + 2 ln ln N + O(1), 2  and for m = n − 1 or m = n, (f)  n ln I[N,YD ] = N ln P(Y |ωML ) − ln N + O(1), 2  regardless of k as N → ∞. [sent-395, score-2.608]
</p><p>24 An adversary may argue that evaluating the marginal likelihood on singular points is not needed because one could exclude from the model all singular points which only have measure zero. [sent-396, score-0.342]
</p><p>25 Second, the sets of extremum points of the exponent (maximum log-likelihood points) are found, and then the new integral is computed in the neighborhoods of extremum points. [sent-434, score-0.465]

</p><p>27 Then we subtract products of the ﬁrst n coordinates with one of the new coordinates to remove the second terms, namely, zi jk = νi jk − νi ν j νk − zi j νk − zik ν j − z jk νi , and so forth. [sent-499, score-0.84]
</p><p>28 We end up with the transformation T32 : Λ → Λ deﬁned by zi = νi , zi j = νi j − νi ν j , zi jk = νi jk − νi ν j νk − zi j νk − zik ν j − z jk νi , etc. [sent-500, score-1.03]

</p><p>30 The ﬁrst lemma states that under Assumptions A1 and A3, the integral I[N,YD ] can be asymptotically evaluated in the (x, u, s) coordinates for a limiting statistics Y , while dismissing the contribution of the density function µ. [sent-536, score-0.391]
</p><p>31 Then, fY = P(Y |ωML ) and ˜ ln I[N,YD ] = N fY + ln I[N,Y ] + O(1)  (30)  for all N > 1. [sent-541, score-0.652]

</p><p>33 Lemmas 6 and 7 jointly state that the asymptotic forms of ln J[N,Y ] and ln I[N,YD ] are identical up to an additive term N fY and a constant provided that Y is the limiting statistics of YD (Assumption A3). [sent-556, score-0.814]
</p><p>34 The zero set U0 can be written as the union of n + 2 sets ¯ ¯ U0 = U0− ∪ U0+ ∪  n [  ¯ U0 j ,  (34)  j=1  where −γi 1−γi 2 , 2  U0− = (x = γ, u, s = −1) | ui ∈ U0+ = (x = γ, u, s = 1) | ui ∈  γi −1 γi 2 , 2  , i = 1, . [sent-585, score-0.398]
</p><p>35 Consequently, one could perhaps guess from the classical Laplace approximation analysis that because the zero subsets U0− , U0+ have dimension n, the coefﬁcient of the ln N term would be at least −(2n + 1 − n)/2 = −(n + 1)/2. [sent-603, score-0.357]
</p><p>36 27), we obtain φ(x, u, s) = ∑I [zI (x + x, u + u, s + s) − zI ]2 = ∑i [zi − zi ]2 + ∑i j,i= j [zi j − zi j ]2 + ∑i jk,i= j=k [zi jk − zi jk ]2 + . [sent-626, score-0.699]
</p><p>37 For example, third terms are of form (zi jk − zi jk )2 = 4(s + s)2 (1 − (s + s)2 )2 u2 u2 u2 ≤ 5ε2 u2 u2 for all s, ui , u j , uk < ε for ε small enough. [sent-632, score-0.624]
</p><p>38 Consequently, due to Lemmas 6 and 7, ln I[N,YD ] = N · P(Y |ωML ) − n+1 2 ln N + O(1), as claimed by Theorem 4c. [sent-650, score-0.652]
</p><p>39 Discussion This paper presents an asymptotic approximation of the marginal likelihood of data given a naive Bayesian model with binary variables (Theorem 4). [sent-652, score-0.448]
</p><p>40 This Theorem proves that the classical BIC score that penalizes the log-likelihood of a model by d ln N is incorrect for Bayesian networks with 2 hidden variables and suggests an adjusted BIC score. [sent-653, score-0.572]
</p><p>41 Nevertheless, this Theorem is an essential advance towards developing asymptotic Bayesian methods for model selection among naive Bayesian models in particular, and for Bayesian networks with hidden variables in general. [sent-661, score-0.387]
</p><p>42 Develop a closed form asymptotic formula for marginal likelihood integrals for all types of statistics Y given an arbitrary latent Bayesian model. [sent-664, score-0.376]
</p><p>43 Develop an algorithm that, given a Bayesian network with hidden variables and a data set with statistics YD , determines the possible singularity types of the limit statistics Y and applies the appropriate asymptotic formula developed in step 2. [sent-669, score-0.378]
</p><p>44 15, 16), one can see that a naive Bayesian network with all links present is somewhat under-evaluated using the classical BIC score for singular statistics Y because the penalty term reduces from (2n + 1)/2 in the classical score to (2n − 1)/2 (or (n + 1)/2) in the adjusted score. [sent-673, score-0.55]
</p><p>45 This results in complex surfaces of maximum likelihood points in the model parameter space and, consequently, a non-standard behavior of marginal likelihood integrals which we have started to explore in this paper. [sent-685, score-0.347]

</p><p>50 , 2n and Y ∈ ϒ0 \S, then asymptotic approximation of ln I[N,YD ] (Eq. [sent-792, score-0.461]

</p><p>52 That is because the integrand function eN ∑x Yx ln θx (w) = ∏x θx (w)NYx satisﬁes 0 ≤ θx (w)NYx ≤ 1 for all N, YD , i and w = (a, b,t) ∈ Ω and because µ(a, b,t) is a probability density function on Ω, thus integral I[N,YD ] ˜ is ﬁnite (and less than 1). [sent-797, score-0.527]
</p><p>53 Since the value of e−N f (x,u,s) outside the small neighborhoods of the minimums f is exponentially small, so the asymptotic behavior of ˜ ˜ I[N,Y ] on U is actually described by integration of I[N,Y ] in the small neighborhoods of minimums ˜ of f (Lemma 7). [sent-800, score-0.58]
</p><p>54 Since I[N,Y ] converges and Claims B1, B3 and B4 of Lemma 9 hold, it follows ˜ that in sufﬁciently small neighborhoods of the two internal minimum points of f , the integral I[N,Y ] can be computed by Lemma 1 (Laplace Approximation). [sent-801, score-0.383]

<p>Author: Evgeny Drukh, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We show several high-probability concentration bounds for learning unigram language models. One interesting quantity is the probability of all words appearing exactly k times in a sample of size m. A standard estimator for this quantity is the Good-Turing estimator. The existing analysis on k its error shows a high-probability bound of approximately O √m . We improve its dependency on k to O √ 4 √k m k + m . We also analyze the empirical frequencies estimator, showing that with high probability its error is bounded by approximately O 2 −5 which has an error of approximately O m 1 k + √ k m . We derive a combined estimator, , for any k. A standard measure for the quality of a learning algorithm is its expected per-word log-loss. The leave-one-out method can be used for estimating the log-loss of the unigram model. We show 1 that its error has a high-probability bound of approximately O √m , for any underlying distribution. We also bound the log-loss a priori, as a function of various parameters of the distribution. Keywords: Good-Turing estimators, logarithmic loss, leave-one-out estimation, Chernoff bounds 1. Introduction and Overview Natural language processing (NLP) has developed rapidly over the last decades. It has a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, optical character recognition, text categorization and many more. The theoretical analysis has also advanced signiﬁcantly, though many fundamental questions remain unanswered. One clear challenge, both practical and theoretical, concerns deriving stochastic models for natural languages. Consider a simple language model, where the distribution of each word in the text is assumed to be independent. Even for such a simplistic model, fundamental questions relating sample size to the learning accuracy are already challenging. This is mainly due to the fact that the sample size is almost always insufﬁcient, regardless of how large it is. To demonstrate this phenomena, consider the following example. We would like to estimate the distribution of ﬁrst names in the university. For that, we are given the names list of a graduate seminar: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dan, Eve, Frank, two Georges, and two Henries. How can we use this sample to estimate the distribution of students’ ﬁrst names? An empirical frequency estimator would c 2005 Evgeny Drukh and Yishay Mansour. D RUKH AND M ANSOUR assign Alice the probability of 0.1, since there is one Alice in the list of 10 names, while George, appearing twice, would get estimation of 0.2. Unfortunately, unseen names, such as Michael, will get an estimation of 0. Clearly, in this simple example the empirical frequencies are unlikely to estimate well the desired distribution. In general, the empirical frequencies estimate well the probabilities of popular names, but are rather inaccurate for rare names. Is there a sample size, which assures us that all the names (or most of them) will appear enough times to allow accurate probabilities estimation? The distribution of ﬁrst names can be conjectured to follow the Zipf’s law. In such distributions, there will be a signiﬁcant fraction of rare items, as well as a considerable number of non-appearing items, in any sample of reasonable size. The same holds for the language unigram models, which try to estimate the distribution of single words. As it has been observed empirically on many occasions (Chen, 1996; Curran and Osborne, 2002), there are always many rare words and a considerable number of unseen words, regardless of the sample size. Given this observation, a fundamental issue is to estimate the distribution the best way possible. 1.1 Good-Turing Estimators An important quantity, given a sample, is the probability mass of unseen words (also called “the missing mass”). Several methods exist for smoothing the probability and assigning probability mass to unseen items. The almost standard method for estimating the missing probability mass is the Good-Turing estimator. It estimates the missing mass as the total number of unique items, divided by the sample size. In the names example above, the Good-Turing missing mass estimator is equal 0.6, meaning that the list of the class names does not reﬂect the true distribution, to put it mildly. The Good-Turing estimator can be extended for higher orders, that is, estimating the probability of all names appearing exactly k times. Such estimators can also be used for estimating the probability of individual words. The Good-Turing estimators dates back to World War II, and were published ﬁrst in 1953 (Good, 1953, 2000). It has been extensively used in language modeling applications since then (Katz, 1987; Church and Gale, 1991; Chen, 1996; Chen and Goodman, 1998). However, their theoretical convergence rate in various models has been studied only in the recent years (McAllester and Schapire, 2000, 2001; Kutin, 2002; McAllester and Ortiz, 2003; Orlitsky et al., 2003). For estimation of the probability of all words appearing exactly k times in a sample of size m, McAllester and Schapire k (2000) derive a high probability bound on Good-Turing estimator error of approximately O √m . One of our main results improves the dependency on k of this bound to approximately O √ 4 √k + k m m √ k 1 k+ m , We also show that the empirical frequencies estimator has an error of approximately O for large values of k. Based on the two estimators, we derive a combined estimator with an error of √ 4 2 k approximately O m− 5 , for any k. We also derive a weak lower bound of Ω √m for an error of any estimator based on an independent sample. Our results give theoretical justiﬁcation for using the Good-Turing estimator for small values of k, and the empirical frequencies estimator for large values of k. Though in most applications the Good-Turing estimator is used for very small values of k, for example k ≤ 5, as by Katz (1987) or Chen (1996), we show that it is fairly accurate in a much wider range. 1232 . C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS 1.2 Logarithmic Loss The Good-Turing estimators are used to approximate the probability mass of all the words with a certain frequency. For many applications, estimating this probability mass is not the main optimization criteria. Instead, a certain distance measure between the true and the estimated distributions needs to be minimized. The most popular distance measure used in NLP applications is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. For a true distribution P = {px }, and an estimated distribution Q = {qx }, both over some px set X, this measure is deﬁned as ∑x px ln qx . An equivalent measure, up to the entropy of P, is the 1 logarithmic loss (log-loss), which equals ∑x px ln qx . Many NLP applications use the value of log-loss to evaluate the quality of the estimated distribution. However, the log-loss cannot be directly calculated, since it depends on the underlying distribution, which is unknown. Therefore, estimating log-loss using the sample is important, although the sample cannot be independently used for both estimating the distribution and testing it. The hold-out estimation splits the sample into two parts: training and testing. The training part is used for learning the distribution, whereas the testing sample is used for evaluating the average per-word log-loss. The main disadvantage of this method is the fact that it uses only part of the available information for learning, whereas in practice one would like to use all the sample. A widely used general estimation method is called leave-one-out. Basically, it performs averaging all the possible estimations, where a single item is chosen for testing, and the rest are used for training. This procedure has an advantage of using the entire sample, and in addition it is rather simple and usually can be easily implemented. The existing theoretical analysis of the leave-oneout method (Holden, 1996; Kearns and Ron, 1999) shows general high probability concentration bounds for the generalization error. However, these techniques are not applicable in our setting. 1 We show that the leave-one-out estimation error for the log-loss is approximately O √m , for any underlying distribution and a general family of learning algorithms. It gives a theoretical justiﬁcation for effective use of leave-one-out estimation for the log-loss. We also analyze the concentration of the log-loss itself, not based of an empirical measure. We address the characteristics of the underlying distribution affecting the log-loss. We ﬁnd such a characteristic, deﬁning a tight bound for the log-loss value. 1.3 Model and Semantics We denote the set of all words as V , and N = |V |. Let P be a distribution over V , where pw is the probability of a word w ∈ V . Given a sample S of size m, drawn i.i.d. using P, we denote the number of appearances of a word w in S as cS , or simply cw , when a sample S is clear from the context.1 We w deﬁne Sk = {w ∈ V : cS = k}, and nk = |Sk |. w For a claim Φ regarding a sample S, we write ∀δ S Φ[S] for P(Φ[S]) ≥ 1 − δ. For some error c ˜ bound function f (·), which holds with probability 1 − δ, we write O( f (·)) for O f (·) ln m , δ where c > 0 is some constant. 1.4 Paper Organization Section 2 shows several standard concentration inequalities, together with their technical applications regarding the maximum-likelihood approximation. Section 3 shows the error bounds for the 1. Unless mentioned otherwise, all further sample-dependent deﬁnitions depend on the sample S. 1233 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR k-hitting mass estimation. Section 4 bounds the error for the leave-one-out estimation of the logarithmic loss. Section 5 shows the bounds for the a priori logarithmic loss. Appendix A includes the technical proofs. 2. Concentration Inequalities In this section we state several standard Chernoff-style concentration inequalities. We also show some of their corollaries regarding the maximum-likelihood approximation of pw by pw = cw . ˆ m Lemma 1 (Hoeffding, 1963) Let Y = Y1 , . . . ,Yn be a set of n independent random variables, such that Yi ∈ [bi , bi + di ]. Then, for any ε > 0, P ∑ Yi − E ∑ Yi i >ε i ≤ 2 exp − 2ε2 ∑i di2 . The next lemma is a variant of an extension of Hoeffding’s inequality, by McDiarmid (1989). Lemma 2 Let Y = Y1 , . . . ,Yn be a set of n independent random variables, and f (Y ) such that any change of Yi value changes f (Y ) by at most di , that is sup ∀ j=i,Y j =Y j (| f (Y ) − f (Y )|) ≤ di . Let d = maxi di . Then, ∀δY : | f (Y ) − E[ f (Y )]| ≤ d n ln 2 δ . 2 Lemma 3 (Angluin and Valiant, 1979) Let Y = Y1 , . . . ,Yn be a set of n independent random variables, where Yi ∈ [0, B]. Let µ = E [∑i Yi ]. Then, for any ε > 0, P ∑ Yi < µ − ε ≤ exp − ε2 , 2µB ∑ Yi > µ + ε ≤ exp − ε2 . (2µ + ε)B i P i Deﬁnition 4 (Dubhashi and Ranjan, 1998) A set of random variables Y1 , . . . ,Yn is called “negatively associated”, if it satisﬁes for any two disjoint subsets I and J of {1, . . . , n}, and any two non-decreasing, or any two non-increasing, functions f from R|I| to R and g from R|J| to R: E[ f (Yi : i ∈ I)g(Y j : j ∈ J)] ≤ E[ f (Yi : i ∈ I)]E[g(Y j : j ∈ J)]. The next lemma is based on the negative association analysis. It follows directly from Theorem 14 and Proposition 7 of Dubhashi and Ranjan (1998). 1234 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS Lemma 5 For any set of N non-decreasing, or N non-increasing functions { fw : w ∈ V }, any Chernoff-style bound on ∑w∈V fw (cw ), pretending that cw are independent, is valid. In particular, Lemmas 1 and 2 apply for {Y1 , ...,Yn } = { fw (cw ) : w ∈ V }. The next lemma shows an explicit upper bound on the binomial distribution probability.2 Lemma 6 Let X ∼ Bin(n, p) be a sum of n i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with p ∈ (0, 1). Let 1 µ = E[X] = np. For x ∈ (0, n], there exists some function Tx = exp 12x + O x12 , such that ∀k ∈ Tn 1 {0, . . . , n}, we have P(X = k) ≤ √ Tµ Tn−µ . For integral values of µ, the equality is achieved 2πµ(1−p) at k = µ. (Note that for x ≥ 1, we have Tx = Θ(1).) The next lemma deals with the number of successes in independent trials. Lemma 7 (Hoeffding, 1956) Let Y1 , . . . ,Yn ∈ {0, 1} be a sequence of independent trials, with pi = 1 E[Yi ]. Let X = ∑i Yi be the number of successes, and p = n ∑i pi be the average trial success probability. For any integers b and c such that 0 ≤ b ≤ np ≤ c ≤ n, we have c ∑ k=b n k p (1 − p)n−k ≤ P (b ≤ X ≤ c) ≤ 1. k Using the above lemma, the next lemma shows a general concentration bound for a sum of arbitrary real-valued functions of a multinomial distribution components. We show that with a small penalty, any Chernoff-style bound pretending the components being independent is valid.3 We recall that cS , or equivalently cw , is the number of appearances of the word w in a sample S of w size m. Lemma 8 Let {cw ∼ Bin(m, pw ) : w ∈ V } be independent binomial random variables. Let { fw (x) : w ∈ V } be a set of real valued functions. Let F = ∑w fw (cw ) and F = ∑w fw (cw ). For any ε > 0, √ P (|F − E [F]| > ε) ≤ 3 m P F − E F >ε . The following lemmas provide concentration bounds for maximum-likelihood estimation of pw by pw = cw . The ﬁrst lemma shows that words with “high” probability have a “high” count in the ˆ m sample. Lemma 9 Let δ > 0, and λ ≥ 3. We have ∀δ S: ∀w ∈ V, s.t. mpw ≥ 3 ln 2m , δ |mpw − cw | ≤ ∀w ∈ V, s.t. mpw > λ ln 2m , δ cw > 1− 3mpw ln 3 λ 2m ; δ mpw . 2. Its proof is based on Stirling approximation directly, though local limit theorems could be used. This form of bound is needed for the proof of Theorem 30. 3. The negative association analysis (Lemma 5) shows that a sum of monotone functions of multinomial distribution components must obey Chernoff-style bounds pretending that the components are independent. In some sense, our result extends this notion, since it does not require the functions to be monotone. 1235 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR The second lemma shows that words with “low” probability have a “low” count in the sample. Lemma 10 Let δ ∈ (0, 1), and m > 1. Then, ∀δ S: ∀w ∈ V such that mpw ≤ 3 ln m , we have cw ≤ δ 6 ln m . δ The following lemma derives the bound as a function of the count in the sample (and not as a function of the unknown probability). Lemma 11 Let δ > 0. Then, ∀δ S: cw > 18 ln 4m , δ ∀w ∈ V, s.t. |mpw − cw | ≤ 6cw ln 4m . δ The following is a general concentration bound. Lemma 12 For any δ > 0, and any word w ∈ V , we have ∀δ S, cw − pw < m 3 ln 2 δ . m The following lemma bounds the probability of words that do not appear in the sample. Lemma 13 Let δ > 0. Then, ∀δ S: ∀w ∈ S, / mpw < ln m . δ 3. K-Hitting Mass Estimation In this section our goal is to estimate the probability of the set of words appearing exactly k times in the sample, which we call “the k-hitting mass”. We analyze the Good-Turing estimator, the empirical frequencies estimator, and a combined estimator. ˆ Deﬁnition 14 We deﬁne the k-hitting mass Mk , its empirical frequencies estimator Mk , and its 4 Good-Turing estimator Gk as Mk = ∑ w∈Sk pw ˆ Mk = k nk m Gk = k+1 nk+1 . m−k The outline of this section is as follows. Deﬁnition 16 slightly redeﬁnes the k-hitting mass and its estimators. Lemma 17 shows that this redeﬁnition has a negligible inﬂuence. Then, we analyze the estimation errors using the concentration inequalities from Section 2. Lemmas 20 and 21 bound the expectation of the Good-Turing estimator error, following McAllester and Schapire (2000). Lemma 23 bounds the deviation of the error, using the negative association analysis. A tighter bound, based on Lemma 8, is achieved at Theorem 25. Theorem 26 analyzes the error of the empirical frequencies estimator. Theorem 29 refers to the combined estimator. Finally, Theorem 30 shows a weak lower bound for the k-hitting mass estimation. 4. The Good-Turing estimator is usually deﬁned as ( k+1 )nk+1 . The two deﬁnitions are almost identical for small values m k of k, as their quotient equals 1 − m . Following McAllester and Schapire (2000), our deﬁnition makes the calculations slightly simpler. 1236 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS Deﬁnition 15 For any w ∈ V and i ∈ {0, · · · , m}, we deﬁne Xw,i as a random variable equal 1 if cw = i, and 0 otherwise. The following deﬁnition concentrates on words whose frequencies are close to their probabilities. Deﬁnition 16 Let α > 0 and k > 3α2 . We deﬁne Ik,α = pw ∈ Ik,α }. We deﬁne: Mk,α = ∑ pw = w∈Sk ∩Vk,α ∑ √ √ k−α k k+1+α k+1 m , m , and Vk,α = {w ∈ V : pw Xw,k , w∈Vk,α Gk,α = k+1 k+1 |Sk+1 ∩Vk,α | = ∑ Xw,k+1 , m−k m − k w∈Vk,α ˆ Mk,α = k k |Sk ∩Vk,α | = ∑ Xw,k . m m w∈Vk,α By Lemma 11, for large values of k the redeﬁnition coincides with the original deﬁnition with high probability: Lemma 17 For δ > 0, let α = ˆ ˆ and Mk = Mk,α . 6 ln 4m . For k > 18 ln 4m , we have ∀δ S: Mk = Mk,α , Gk = Gk,α , δ δ Proof By Lemma 11, we have ∀δ S, ∀w : cw > 18 ln 4m , δ |mpw − cw | ≤ 6cw ln √ 4m = α cw . δ This means that any word w with cw = k has √ √ √ k−α k k+α k k+1+α k+1 ≤ pw ≤ < . m m m √ ˆ Therefore w ∈ Vk,α , completing the proof for Mk and Mk . Since α < k, any word w with cw = k + 1 has √ √ √ k−α k k+1−α k+1 k+1+α k+1 < ≤ pw ≤ , m m m which yields w ∈ Vk,α , completing the proof for Gk . Since the minimal probability of a word in Vk,α is Ω Lemma 18 Let α > 0 and k > 3α2 . Then, |Vk,α | = O 1237 m k k m . , we derive: D RUKH AND M ANSOUR Proof We have α < √ √k . 3 Any word w ∈ Vk,α has pw ≥ |Vk,α | < √ k−α k m > k m 1 1 − √3 . Therefore, m m 1 , =O 1 k 1− √ k 3 which completes the proof. Using Lemma 6, we derive: Lemma 19 Let α > 0 and 3α2 < k ≤ m . Let w ∈ Vk,α . Then, E[Xw,k ] = P(cw = k) = O 2 1 √ k . Proof Since cw ∼ Bin(m, pw ) is a binomial random variable, we use Lemma 6: E[Xw,k ] = P(cw = k) ≤ Tm 1 . 2πmpw (1 − pw ) Tmpw Tm(1−pw ) For w ∈ Vk,α , we have mpw = Ω(k), which implies 3α2 < k ≤ m 2, Tm Tmpw Tm(1−pw ) we have 1 2πmpw (1 − pw ) ≤ = O(1). Since pw ∈ Ik,α and 1 √ 2π k − α k √ k+1+α k+1 m 1− 1 < 1 2πk 1 − √3 1 1 − k+1 1 + √3 m 1 < 1 2πk 1 − √3 1− 1 2 1 +m 1 1 + √3 1 = O √ , k which completes the proof. 3.1 Good-Turing Estimator The following lemma, directly based on the deﬁnition of the binomial distribution, was shown in Theorem 1 of McAllester and Schapire (2000). Lemma 20 For any k < m, and w ∈ V , we have pw P(cw = k) = k+1 P(cw = k + 1)(1 − pw ). m−k The following lemma bounds the expectations of the redeﬁned k-hitting mass, its Good-Turing estimator, and their difference. 1238 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS Lemma 21 Let α > 0 and 3α2 < k < |E[Gk,α ] − E[Mk,α ]| = O √ k m m 2.

Since {bwYw,k } and {bw Zw,k } are monotone with respect to {cw }, Lemma 5 applies for them. This means that the concentration of their sum is at least as tight as if they were independent.

Leave-One-Out Estimation of Log-Loss Many NLP applications use log-loss as the learning performance criteria. Since the log-loss depends on the underlying probability P, its value cannot be explicitly calculated, and must be approximated. The main result of this section, Theorem 32, is an upper bound on the leave-one-out estimation of the log-loss, assuming a general family of learning algorithms. Given a sample S = {s1 , . . . , sm }, the goal of a learning algorithm is to approximate the true probability P by some probability Q. We denote the probability assigned by the learning algorithm to a word w by qw . Deﬁnition 31 We assume that any two words with equal sample frequency are assigned equal probabilities in Q, and therefore denote qw by q(cw ). Let the log-loss of a distribution Q be L = 1 1 ∑ pw ln qw = ∑ Mk ln q(k) . w∈V k≥0 Let the leave-one-out estimation, qw , be the probability assigned to w, when one of its instances is removed. We assume that any two words with equal sample frequency are assigned equal leaveone-out probability estimation, and therefore denote qw by q (cw ). We deﬁne the leave-one-out estimation of the log-loss as averaging the loss of each sample word, when it is extracted from the sample and pretended to be the test sample: 1243 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR ∑ Lleave−one = w∈V cw knk 1 1 =∑ ln ln . m qw k>0 m q (k) 1 1 Let Lw = L(cw ) = ln q(cw ) , and Lw = L (cw ) = ln q (cw ) . Let the maximal loss be Lmax = max max L(k), L (k + 1) . k In this section we discuss a family of learning algorithms, that receive the sample as an input. Assuming an accuracy parameter δ, we require the following properties to hold: 1. Starting from a certain number of appearances, the estimation is close to the sample frequency. Speciﬁcally, for some α, β ∈ [0, 1], ∀k ≥ ln 4m , δ q(k) = k−α . m−β (10) 2.

Equation (10) is satisﬁed by α = β = 1. Equation (11) is satisﬁed for k ≥ 2 by L(k) − L (k + 1) = 1 = O m . Equation (12) is satisﬁed for k ≤ 1: ln m−1 m−2 N − n0 − 1 m − 2 N − n0 − 2 m − 1 n0 + n1 + 1 m − 2 |L (2) − L(1)| = ln n0 + n1 m − 1 |L (1) − L(0)| = ln 1 1 1 =O + , N − n0 m n1 1 1 1 =O + . =O n0 + n1 m n1 =O The following is the main theorem of this section. It bounds the deviation between the between the true loss and the leave one out estimate. This bound shows that for a general family of learning algorithms, leave-one-out technique can be effectively used to estimate the logarithmic loss, given the sample only. The estimation error bound decreases roughly in proportion to the square root of the sample size, regardless of the underlying distribution. 1244 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS Theorem 32 For a learning algorithm satisfying Equations (10), (11), and (12), and δ > 0, we have: δ ∀ S, |L − Lleave−one | = O Lmax (ln m )4 ln δ m ln m δ δ . The proof of Theorem 32 bounds the estimation error separately for the high-probability and low-probability words. We use Lemma 20 (McAllester and Schapire, 2000) to bound the estimation error for low-probability words. The expected estimation error for the high-probability words is bounded elementarily using the deﬁnition of the binomial distribution (Lemma 33). Finally, we use McDiarmid’s inequality (Lemma 2) to bound its deviation. The next lemma shows that the expectation of the leave-one-out method is a good approximation for the per-word expectation of the logarithmic loss. Lemma 33 Let 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, and y ≥ 1. Let Bn ∼ Bin(n, p) be a binomial random variable. Let fy (x) = ln(max(x, y)). Then, 0 ≤ E p fy (Bn − α) − 3p Bn fy (Bn − α − 1) ≤ . n n Proof For a real valued function F (here F(x) = fy (x − α)), we have: E Bn F(Bn − 1) n n = ∑ x=0 n = p∑ x=1 n x x p (1 − p)n−x F(x − 1) x n n − 1 x−1 p (1 − p)(n−1)−(x−1) F(x − 1) x−1 = pE[F(Bn−1 )] , where we used n x x n = E p fy (Bn − α) − n−1 x−1 . Since Bn ∼ Bn−1 + B1 , we have: Bn fy (Bn − α − 1) n = p(E[ fy (Bn−1 + B1 − α)] − E[ fy (Bn−1 − α)]) max(Bn−1 + B1 − α, y) max(Bn−1 − α, y) max(Bn−1 − α + B1 , y + B1 ) ≤ pE ln max(Bn−1 − α, y) B1 = pE ln(1 + ) max(Bn−1 − α, y) B1 ≤ pE . max(Bn−1 − α, y) = pE ln Since B1 and Bn−1 are independent, we get 1245 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR pE B1 1 = pE[B1 ]E max(Bn−1 − α, y) max(Bn−1 − α, y) 1 = p2 E max(Bn−1 − α, y) n−1 = p2 ∑ n−1 x 1 p (1 − p)n−1−x x max(x − α, y) = p2 ∑ x+1 1 n−1 x p (1 − p)n−1−x x + 1 max(x − α, y) x x=0 n−1 x=0 ≤ ≤ n−1 p x+1 n max px+1 (1 − p)n−(x+1) ∑ n x max(x − α, y) x=0 x + 1 3p 3p (1 − (1 − p)n ) < .

Finally, pE ln max(Bn−1 −α+B1 ,y) ≥ 0, which implies the lower bound of the lemma. max(Bn−1 −α,y) The following lemma bounds n2 as a function of n1 . Lemma 34 Let δ > 0.

Suppose that a word u is replaced by a word v. This results in decrease H for cu , and increase for cv . Recalling that yw = Ω(mpw ), the change of Erru , as well as the change H , is bounded by O ln m , as follows: of Errv m m−β The change of pu ln max(cu −α,yu ) would be 0 if cu − α ≤ yu .

D RUKH AND M ANSOUR The proof follows by combining Equations (16), (19), and (27). 5. Log-Loss A Priori Section 4 bounds the error of the leave-one-out estimation of the log-loss. It shows that the log-loss can be effectively estimated, for a general family of learning algorithms. Another question to be considered is the log-loss distribution itself, without the empirical estimation. That is, how large (or low) is it expected to be, and which parameters of the distribution affect it. We denote the learning error (equivalent to the log-loss) as the KL-divergence between the true and the estimated distribution. We refer to a general family of learning algorithms, and show lower and upper bounds for the learning error. The upper bound (Theorem 39) can be divided to three parts. The ﬁrst part is the missing mass. The other two build a trade-off between a threshold (lower thresholds leads to a lower bound), and the number of words with probability exceeding this threshold (fewer words lead to a lower bound). It seems that this number of words is a necessary lower bound, as we show at Theorem 35. 1 Theorem 35 Let the distribution be uniform: ∀w ∈ V : pw = N , with N m. Also, suppose that the learning algorithm just uses maximum-likelihood approximation, meaning qw = cw . Then, a typical m learning error would be Ω( N ). m The proof of Theorem 35 bases on the Pinsker inequality (Lemma 36). It ﬁrst shows a lower bound for L1 norm between the true and the expected distributions, and then transforms it to the form of the learning error. Lemma 36 (Pinsker Inequality) Given any two distributions P and Q, we have 1 KL(P||Q) ≥ (L1 (P, Q))2 . 2 Theorem 35 Proof We ﬁrst show that L1 (P, Q) concentrates near Ω N m . Then, we use Pinsker inequality to show lower bound5 of KL(P||Q). First we ﬁnd a lower bound for E[|pw − qw |]. Since cw is a binomial random variable, σ2 [cw ] = m mpw (1 − pw ) = Ω N , and with some constant probability, |cw − mpw | > σ[cw ]. Therefore, we have E[|qw − pw |] = ≥ E 1 E[|cw − mpw |] m 1 1 σ[cw ]P(|cw − mpw | > σ[cw ]) = Ω m m ∑ |pw − qw | w∈V = Ω N√ 1 mN =Ω 1 =Ω √ mN m N N m . 5. This proof does not optimize the constants. Asymptotic analysis of logarithmic transform of binomial variables by Flajolet (1999) can be used to achieve explicit values for KL(P||Q). 1250 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS 2 A single change in the sample changes L1 (P, Q) by at most m . Using McDiarmid inequality 1 (Lemma 2) on L1 (P, Q) as a function of sample words, we have ∀ 2 S: L1 (P, Q) ≥ E[L1 (P, Q)] − |L1 (P, Q) − E[L1 (P, Q)]| √ N m N −O =Ω . = Ω m m m Using Pinsker inequality (Lemma 36), we have 1 2 ∀ S, pw 1 ∑ pw ln qw ≥ 2 w∈V 2 ∑ |pw − qw | =Ω w∈V N , m which completes the proof. Deﬁnition 37 Let α ∈ (0, 1) and τ ≥ 1. We deﬁne an (absolute discounting) algorithm Aα,τ , which α “removes” m probability mass from words appearing at most τ times, and uniformly spreads it among the unseen words. We denote by n1...τ = ∑τ ni the number of words with count between 1 i=1 and τ. The learned probability Q is deﬁned by :  αn1...τ cw = 0  mn0 cw −α qw = 1 ≤ cw ≤ τ m  cw τ < cw . m The α parameter can be set to some constant, or to make the missing mass match the Good1...τ Turing missing mass estimator, that is αnm = n1 . m Deﬁnition 38 Given a distribution P, and x ∈ [0, 1], let Fx = ∑w∈V :pw ≤x pw , and Nx = |{w ∈ V : pw > x}|. Clearly, for any distribution P, Fx is a monotone function of x, varying from 0 to 1, and Nx is a monotone function of x, varying from N to 0. Note that Nx is bounded by 1 . x The next theorem shows an upper bound for the learning error. √ Theorem 39 For any δ > 0 and λ > 3, such that τ < (λ − 3λ) ln 8m , the learning error of Aα,τ is δ bounded ∀δ S by pw 0 ≤ ∑ pw ln qw w∈V ≤ M0 ln + n0 ln 4m δ αn1...τ α F 8m + 1 − α λ lnm δ 1251  λ ln 8m δ  + 1−α  3 ln 8 δ + M0  m 3 ln 8 3λ ln 8m δ δ + √ N λ ln 8m . √ δ m 2( λ − 3)2 m m D RUKH AND M ANSOUR The proof of Theorem 39 bases directly on Lemmas 40, 41, and 43. We can rewrite this bound roughly as Nλ λ ˜ ≤ O M0 + √ + m m m pw qw ∑ pw ln w∈V . This bound implies the characteristics of the distribution inﬂuencing the log-loss. It shows that a “good” distribution can involve many low-probability words, given that the missing mass is low. However, the learning error would increase if the dictionary included many mid-range3 probability words. For example, if a typical word’s probability were m− 4 , the bound would become 1 ˜ O M0 + m− 4 . Lemma 40 For any δ > 0, the learning error for non-appearing words can be bounded with high probability by ∑ ∀δ S, pw ln w∈S / pw qw ≤ M0 ln n0 ln m δ αn1...τ . Proof By Lemma 13, we have ∀δ S, the real probability of any non-appearing word does not exceed ln m δ m .

Also, the distribution of {cw } given that m = m is identical to the distribution of {cw }, therefore the distribution of F given that m = m is identical to the distribution of F. We have P(|F − E[F ]| > ε) = ∑ P(m i = i)P(|F − E[F ]| > ε|m = i) ≥ P(m = m)P(|F − E[F ]| > ε|m = m) = P(m = m)P(|F − E[F]| > ε) 1 √ P(|F − E[F]| > ε), ≥ 3 m which completes the proof.

The ﬁrst claim follows δ using Lemma 44 together with union bound over all these words (with accuracy m for each word). Using the ﬁrst claim, we derive the second. We show a lower bound for 3pw ln 2m δ > pw − pw m cw ≥ pw − m 3 = λ 1− 3 λ cw m, using ln 2m δ m 1 < λ pw : pw . The ﬁnal inequality follows from simple algebra. Lemma 10 Proof Let b = 3 ln( m ). Note that δ ∈ [0, 1] and m > 1 yield b > 2. First, suppose that δ b there are up to m words with pw ≤ m . For each such word, we apply Lemma 3 on cw , with ε = b. We have: P cw > 6 ln m b2 ≤ P (cw > mpw + ε) ≤ exp − δ 2mpw + b ≤ δ . m Since we assume that there are up to m such words, the total mistake probability is δ. Now we assume the general case, that is, without any assumption on the number of words. Our goal is to reduce the problem to the former conditions, that is, to create a set of size m of words with b probability smaller than m . We ﬁrst create m empty sets v1 , . . . , vm . Let the probability of each set vi , pvi , be the sum of the probabilities of all the words it includes. Let the actual count of vi , cvi , be the sum of the sample counts of all the words w it includes. We divide all the words w between these sets in a bin-packing-approximation manner. We sort the words w in decreasing probability order. Then, we do the following loop: insert the next word w to the set vi with the currently smallest pvi . b We claim that pvi ≤ m for each vi at the end of the loop. If this inequality does not hold, then b some word w made this “overﬂow” ﬁrst. Obviously, pw must be smaller than 2m , otherwise it would b be one of the ﬁrst 2m < m words ordered, and would enter an empty set. If pw < 2m and it made b b an “overﬂow”, then the probability of each set at the moment w was entered must exceed 2m , since w must have entered the lightest set available. This means that the total probability of all words b entered by that moment was greater than m 2m > 1. Applying the case of m words to the sets v1 , . . . , vm , we have ∀δ S: for every vi , cvi ≤ 2b. Also, if the count of each set vi does not exceed 2b, so does the count of each word w ∈ vi . That is, P ∃w : pw ≤ b b , cw > 2b ≤ P ∃vi : pvi ≤ , cvi > 2b ≤ δ, m m which completes the proof. 1257 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR δ Lemma 11 Proof By Lemma 9 with some λ > 3 (which will be set later), we have ∀ 2 S: 3 ln 4m δ , m λ ln 4m δ ∀w : pw > , m ∀w : pw ≥ By Equation (35), for any word w such that √ λ + 3λ ln 4m .

We provide bounds on the generalization error of this learning algorithm in terms of the number of errors and the size of the classiﬁer it ﬁnds on the training data. We also compare its performance on some natural data sets with the set covering machine and the support vector machine. Furthermore, we show that the proposed bounds on the generalization error provide effective guides for model selection.

<p>Author: Joseph F. Murray, Gordon F. Hughes, Kenneth Kreutz-Delgado</p><p>Abstract: We compare machine learning methods applied to a difﬁcult real-world problem: predicting computer hard-drive failure using attributes monitored internally by individual drives. The problem is one of detecting rare events in a time series of noisy and nonparametrically-distributed data. We develop a new algorithm based on the multiple-instance learning framework and the naive Bayesian classiﬁer (mi-NB) which is speciﬁcally designed for the low false-alarm case, and is shown to have promising performance. Other methods compared are support vector machines (SVMs), unsupervised clustering, and non-parametric statistical tests (rank-sum and reverse arrangements). The failure-prediction performance of the SVM, rank-sum and mi-NB algorithm is considerably better than the threshold method currently implemented in drives, while maintaining low false alarm rates. Our results suggest that nonparametric statistical tests should be considered for learning problems involving detecting rare events in time series data. An appendix details the calculation of rank-sum signiﬁcance probabilities in the case of discrete, tied observations, and we give new recommendations about when the exact calculation should be used instead of the commonly-used normal approximation. These normal approximations may be particularly inaccurate for rare event problems like hard drive failures.

<p>Author: Weng-Keen Wong, Andrew Moore, Gregory Cooper, Michael Wagner</p><p>Abstract: Traditional biosurveillance algorithms detect disease outbreaks by looking for peaks in a univariate time series of health-care data. Current health-care surveillance data, however, are no longer simply univariate data streams. Instead, a wealth of spatial, temporal, demographic and symptomatic information is available. We present an early disease outbreak detection algorithm called What’s Strange About Recent Events (WSARE), which uses a multivariate approach to improve its timeliness of detection. WSARE employs a rule-based technique that compares recent health-care data against data from a baseline distribution and ﬁnds subgroups of the recent data whose proportions have changed the most from the baseline data. In addition, health-care data also pose difﬁculties for surveillance algorithms because of inherent temporal trends such as seasonal effects and day of week variations. WSARE approaches this problem using a Bayesian network to produce a baseline distribution that accounts for these temporal trends. The algorithm itself incorporates a wide range of ideas, including association rules, Bayesian networks, hypothesis testing and permutation tests to produce a detection algorithm that is careful to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the alarms that it raises.

<p>Author: Eran Segal, Dana Pe'er, Aviv Regev, Daphne Koller, Nir Friedman</p><p>Abstract: Methods for learning Bayesian networks can discover dependency structure between observed variables. Although these methods are useful in many applications, they run into computational and statistical problems in domains that involve a large number of variables. In this paper,1 we consider a solution that is applicable when many variables have similar behavior. We introduce a new class of models, module networks, that explicitly partition the variables into modules, so that the variables in each module share the same parents in the network and the same conditional probability distribution. We deﬁne the semantics of module networks, and describe an algorithm that learns the modules’ composition and their dependency structure from data. Evaluation on real data in the domains of gene expression and the stock market shows that module networks generalize better than Bayesian networks, and that the learned module network structure reveals regularities that are obscured in learned Bayesian networks. 1.

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Amir Globerson, Naftali Tishby, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: The problem of extracting the relevant aspects of data was previously addressed through the information bottleneck (IB) method, through (soft) clustering one variable while preserving information about another - relevance - variable. The current work extends these ideas to obtain continuous representations that preserve relevant information, rather than discrete clusters, for the special case of multivariate Gaussian variables. While the general continuous IB problem is difﬁcult to solve, we provide an analytic solution for the optimal representation and tradeoff between compression and relevance for the this important case. The obtained optimal representation is a noisy linear projection to eigenvectors of the normalized regression matrix Σx|y Σ−1 , which is also the basis obtained x in canonical correlation analysis. However, in Gaussian IB, the compression tradeoff parameter uniquely determines the dimension, as well as the scale of each eigenvector, through a cascade of structural phase transitions. This introduces a novel interpretation where solutions of different ranks lie on a continuum parametrized by the compression level. Our analysis also provides a complete analytic expression of the preserved information as a function of the compression (the “information-curve”), in terms of the eigenvalue spectrum of the data. As in the discrete case, the information curve is concave and smooth, though it is made of different analytic segments for each optimal dimension. Finally, we show how the algorithmic theory developed in the IB framework provides an iterative algorithm for obtaining the optimal Gaussian projections.

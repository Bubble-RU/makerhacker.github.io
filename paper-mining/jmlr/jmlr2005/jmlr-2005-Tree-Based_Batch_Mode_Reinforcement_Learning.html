<p>Author: Guy Shani, David Heckerman, Ronen I. Brafman</p><p>Abstract: Typical recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation process and treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential optimization problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a more appropriate model for recommender systems. MDPs introduce two beneﬁts: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation and the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an MDP-based recommender system must employ a strong initial model, must be solvable quickly, and should not consume too much memory. In this paper, we describe our particular MDP model, its initialization using a predictive model, the solution and update algorithm, and its actual performance on a commercial site. We also describe the particular predictive model we used which outperforms previous models. Our system is one of a small number of commercially deployed recommender systems. As far as we know, it is the ﬁrst to report experimental analysis conducted on a real commercial site. These results validate the commercial value of recommender systems, and in particular, of our MDP-based approach.

<p>Author: Gavin Brown, Jeremy L. Wyatt, Peter Tiňo</p><p>Abstract: Ensembles are a widely used and effective technique in machine learning—their success is commonly attributed to the degree of disagreement, or ‘diversity’, within the ensemble. For ensembles where the individual estimators output crisp class labels, this ‘diversity’ is not well understood and remains an open research issue. For ensembles of regression estimators, the diversity can be exactly formulated in terms of the covariance between individual estimator outputs, and the optimum level is expressed in terms of a bias-variance-covariance trade-off. Despite this, most approaches to learning ensembles use heuristics to encourage the right degree of diversity. In this work we show how to explicitly control diversity through the error function. The ﬁrst contribution of this paper is to show that by taking the combination mechanism for the ensemble into account we can derive an error function for each individual that balances ensemble diversity with individual accuracy. We show the relationship between this error function and an existing algorithm called negative correlation learning, which uses a heuristic penalty term added to the mean squared error function. It is demonstrated that these methods control the bias-variance-covariance trade-off systematically, and can be utilised with any estimator capable of minimising a quadratic error function, for example MLPs, or RBF networks. As a second contribution, we derive a strict upper bound on the coefﬁcient of the penalty term, which holds for any estimator that can be cast in a generalised linear regression framework, with mild assumptions on the basis functions. Finally we present the results of an empirical study, showing signiﬁcant improvements over simple ensemble learning, and ﬁnding that this technique is competitive with a variety of methods, including boosting, bagging, mixtures of experts, and Gaussian processes, on a number of tasks.

<p>Author: Susan A. Murphy</p><p>Abstract: Planning problems that involve learning a policy from a single training set of ﬁnite horizon trajectories arise in both social science and medical ﬁelds. We consider Q-learning with function approximation for this setting and derive an upper bound on the generalization error. This upper bound is in terms of quantities minimized by a Q-learning algorithm, the complexity of the approximation space and an approximation term due to the mismatch between Q-learning and the goal of learning a policy that maximizes the value function.

<p>Author: Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: One often wants to estimate statistical models where the probability density function is known only up to a multiplicative normalization constant. Typically, one then has to resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, or approximations of the normalization constant. Here, we propose that such models can be estimated by minimizing the expected squared distance between the gradient of the log-density given by the model and the gradient of the log-density of the observed data. While the estimation of the gradient of log-density function is, in principle, a very diﬃcult non-parametric problem, we prove a surprising result that gives a simple formula for this objective function. The density function of the observed data does not appear in this formula, which simpliﬁes to a sample average of a sum of some derivatives of the log-density given by the model. The validity of the method is demonstrated on multivariate Gaussian and independent component analysis models, and by estimating an overcomplete ﬁlter set for natural image data.

<p>Author: Alexander T. Ihler, John W. Fisher III, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) is an increasingly popular method of performing approximate inference on arbitrary graphical models. At times, even further approximations are required, whether due to quantization of the messages or model parameters, from other simpliﬁed message or model representations, or from stochastic approximation methods. The introduction of such errors into the BP message computations has the potential to affect the solution obtained adversely. We analyze the effect resulting from message approximation under two particular measures of error, and show bounds on the accumulation of errors in the system. This analysis leads to convergence conditions for traditional BP message passing, and both strict bounds and estimates of the resulting error in systems of approximate BP message passing.

The Q-function approximation may be obtained from the limit of a sequence of (batch mode) supervised learning problems. Within this framework we describe the use of several classical tree-based supervised learning methods (CART, Kd-tree, tree bagging) and two newly proposed ensemble algorithms, namely extremely and totally randomized trees. We study their performances on several examples and ﬁnd that the ensemble methods based on regression trees perform well in extracting relevant information about the optimal control policy from sets of four-tuples. In particular, the totally randomized trees give good results while ensuring the convergence of the sequence, whereas by relaxing the convergence constraint even better accuracy results are provided by the extremely randomized trees.

<p>Author: Susan A. Murphy</p><p>Abstract: Planning problems that involve learning a policy from a single training set of ﬁnite horizon trajectories arise in both social science and medical ﬁelds. We consider Q-learning with function approximation for this setting and derive an upper bound on the generalization error. This upper bound is in terms of quantities minimized by a Q-learning algorithm, the complexity of the approximation space and an approximation term due to the mismatch between Q-learning and the goal of learning a policy that maximizes the value function.

<p>Author: David Wingate, Kevin D. Seppi</p><p>Abstract: The performance of value and policy iteration can be dramatically improved by eliminating redundant or useless backups, and by backing up states in the right order. We study several methods designed to accelerate these iterative solvers, including prioritization, partitioning, and variable reordering. We generate a family of algorithms by combining several of the methods discussed, and present extensive empirical evidence demonstrating that performance can improve by several orders of magnitude for many problems, while preserving accuracy and convergence guarantees.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe new loss functions for regression problems along with an accompanying algorithmic framework which utilizes these functions. These loss functions are derived by symmetrization of margin-based losses commonly used in boosting algorithms, namely, the logistic loss and the exponential loss. The resulting symmetric logistic loss can be viewed as a smooth approximation to the ε-insensitive hinge loss used in support vector regression. We describe and analyze two parametric families of batch learning algorithms for minimizing these symmetric losses. The ﬁrst family employs an iterative log-additive update which can be viewed as a regression counterpart to recent boosting algorithms. The second family utilizes an iterative additive update step. We also describe and analyze online gradient descent (GD) and exponentiated gradient (EG) algorithms for the symmetric logistic loss. A byproduct of our work is a new simple form of regularization for boosting-based classiﬁcation and regression algorithms. Our regression framework also has implications on classiﬁcation algorithms, namely, a new additive update boosting algorithm for classiﬁcation. We demonstrate the merits of our algorithms in a series of experiments.</p><p>5 0.22476718 <a title="68-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Large_Margin_Methods_for_Structured_and_Interdependent_Output_Variables.html">42 jmlr-2005-Large Margin Methods for Structured and Interdependent Output Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Tsochantaridis, Thorsten Joachims, Thomas Hofmann, Yasemin Altun</p><p>Abstract: Learning general functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output spaces is one of the key challenges in computational intelligence. While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing ﬂexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classiﬁcation algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classiﬁcation problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.</p><p>6 0.22468555 <a title="68-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Efficient_Computation_of_Gapped_Substring_Kernels_on_Large_Alphabets.html">28 jmlr-2005-Efficient Computation of Gapped Substring Kernels on Large Alphabets</a></p>

<p>Author: Dmitry Rusakov, Dan Geiger</p><p>Abstract: We develop a closed form asymptotic formula to compute the marginal likelihood of data given a naive Bayesian network model with two hidden states and binary features. This formula deviates from the standard BIC score. Our work provides a concrete example that the BIC score is generally incorrect for statistical models that belong to stratiﬁed exponential families. This claim stands in contrast to linear and curved exponential families, where the BIC score has been proven to provide a correct asymptotic approximation for the marginal likelihood.

<p>Author: John Winn, Christopher M. Bishop</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian inference is now widely established as one of the principal foundations for machine learning. In practice, exact inference is rarely possible, and so a variety of approximation techniques have been developed, one of the most widely used being a deterministic framework called variational inference. In this paper we introduce Variational Message Passing (VMP), a general purpose algorithm for applying variational inference to Bayesian Networks. Like belief propagation, VMP proceeds by sending messages between nodes in the network and updating posterior beliefs using local operations at each node. Each such update increases a lower bound on the log evidence (unless already at a local maximum). In contrast to belief propagation, VMP can be applied to a very general class of conjugate-exponential models because it uses a factorised variational approximation. Furthermore, by introducing additional variational parameters, VMP can be applied to models containing non-conjugate distributions. The VMP framework also allows the lower bound to be evaluated, and this can be used both for model comparison and for detection of convergence. Variational message passing has been implemented in the form of a general purpose inference engine called VIBES (‘Variational Inference for BayEsian networkS’) which allows models to be speciﬁed graphically and then solved variationally without recourse to coding.

This tutorial is meant to be a comprehensive compilation of results which are both theoretically rigorous and quantitatively useful. There are two important implications of the results presented here. The ﬁrst is that common practices for reporting results in classiﬁcation should change to use the test set bound. The second is that train set bounds can sometimes be used to directly motivate learning algorithms.

<p>Author: Cheng Soon Ong, Alexander J. Smola, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of choosing a kernel suitable for estimation with a support vector machine, hence further automating machine learning. This goal is achieved by deﬁning a reproducing kernel Hilbert space on the space of kernels itself. Such a formulation leads to a statistical estimation problem similar to the problem of minimizing a regularized risk functional. We state the equivalent representer theorem for the choice of kernels and present a semideﬁnite programming formulation of the resulting optimization problem. Several recipes for constructing hyperkernels are provided, as well as the details of common machine learning problems. Experimental results for classiﬁcation, regression and novelty detection on UCI data show the feasibility of our approach.

We compare these two Gaussian process approaches with a previous ordinal regression method based on support vector machines on some benchmark and real-world data sets, including applications of ordinal regression to collaborative ﬁltering and gene expression analysis. Experimental results on these data sets verify the usefulness of our approach. Keywords: Gaussian processes, ordinal regression, approximate Bayesian inference, collaborative ﬁltering, gene expression analysis, feature selection</p><p>5 0.34277222 <a title="50-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Learning_the_Kernel_Function_via_Regularization.html">48 jmlr-2005-Learning the Kernel Function via Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of ﬁnding an optimal kernel from a prescribed convex set of kernels K for learning a real-valued function by regularization. We establish for a wide variety of regularization functionals that this leads to a convex optimization problem and, for square loss regularization, we characterize the solution of this problem. We show that, although K may be an uncountable set, the optimal kernel is always obtained as a convex combination of at most m + 2 basic kernels, where m is the number of data examples. In particular, our results apply to learning the optimal radial kernel or the optimal dot product kernel.</p><p>6 0.33632708 <a title="50-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Multiclass_Classification_with_Multi-Prototype_Support_Vector_Machines.html">58 jmlr-2005-Multiclass Classification with Multi-Prototype Support Vector Machines</a></p>

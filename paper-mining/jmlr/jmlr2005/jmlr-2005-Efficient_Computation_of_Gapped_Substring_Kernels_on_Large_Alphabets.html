<p>Author: Lior Wolf, Amnon Shashua</p><p>Abstract: The problem of selecting a subset of relevant features in a potentially overwhelming quantity of data is classic and found in many branches of science. Examples in computer vision, text processing and more recently bio-informatics are abundant. In text classiﬁcation tasks, for example, it is not uncommon to have 104 to 107 features of the size of the vocabulary containing word frequency counts, with the expectation that only a small fraction of them are relevant. Typical examples include the automatic sorting of URLs into a web directory and the detection of spam email. In this work we present a deﬁnition of “relevancy” based on spectral properties of the Laplacian of the features’ measurement matrix. The feature selection process is then based on a continuous ranking of the features deﬁned by a least-squares optimization process. A remarkable property of the feature relevance function is that sparse solutions for the ranking values naturally emerge as a result of a “biased non-negativity” of a key matrix in the process. As a result, a simple leastsquares optimization process converges onto a sparse solution, i.e., a selection of a subset of features which form a local maximum over the relevance function. The feature selection algorithm can be embedded in both unsupervised and supervised inference problems and empirical evidence show that the feature selections typically achieve high accuracy even when only a small fraction of the features are relevant.</p><p>3 0.056049824 <a title="28-tfidf-3" href="./jmlr-2005-A_Framework_for_Learning_Predictive_Structures_from_Multiple_Tasks_and_Unlabeled_Data.html">4 jmlr-2005-A Framework for Learning Predictive Structures from Multiple Tasks and Unlabeled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Rie Kubota Ando, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: One of the most important issues in machine learning is whether one can improve the performance of a supervised learning algorithm by including unlabeled data. Methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data are generally referred to as semi-supervised learning. Although a number of such methods are proposed, at the current stage, we still don’t have a complete understanding of their eﬀectiveness. This paper investigates a closely related problem, which leads to a novel approach to semi-supervised learning. Speciﬁcally we consider learning predictive structures on hypothesis spaces (that is, what kind of classiﬁers have good predictive power) from multiple learning tasks. We present a general framework in which the structural learning problem can be formulated and analyzed theoretically, and relate it to learning with unlabeled data. Under this framework, algorithms for structural learning will be proposed, and computational issues will be investigated. Experiments will be given to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the semi-supervised learning setting.</p><p>4 0.046713293 <a title="28-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2005-Large_Margin_Methods_for_Structured_and_Interdependent_Output_Variables.html">42 jmlr-2005-Large Margin Methods for Structured and Interdependent Output Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Tsochantaridis, Thorsten Joachims, Thomas Hofmann, Yasemin Altun</p><p>Abstract: Learning general functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output spaces is one of the key challenges in computational intelligence. While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing ﬂexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classiﬁcation algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classiﬁcation problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.</p><p>5 0.045573685 <a title="28-tfidf-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Learning_Multiple_Tasks_with_Kernel_Methods.html">45 jmlr-2005-Learning Multiple Tasks with Kernel Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Theodoros Evgeniou, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning many related tasks simultaneously using kernel methods and regularization. The standard single-task kernel methods, such as support vector machines and regularization networks, are extended to the case of multi-task learning. Our analysis shows that the problem of estimating many task functions with regularization can be cast as a single task learning problem if a family of multi-task kernel functions we deﬁne is used. These kernels model relations among the tasks and are derived from a novel form of regularizers. Speciﬁc kernels that can be used for multi-task learning are provided and experimentally tested on two real data sets. In agreement with past empirical work on multi-task learning, the experiments show that learning multiple related tasks simultaneously using the proposed approach can signiﬁcantly outperform standard single-task learning particularly when there are many related tasks but few data per task.

<p>Author: Marco Cuturi, Kenji Fukumizu, Jean-Philippe Vert</p><p>Abstract: We present a family of positive deﬁnite kernels on measures, characterized by the fact that the value of the kernel between two measures is a function of their sum. These kernels can be used to derive kernels on structured objects, such as images and texts, by representing these objects as sets of components, such as pixels or words, or more generally as measures on the space of components. Several kernels studied in this work make use of common quantities deﬁned on measures such as entropy or generalized variance to detect similarities. Given an a priori kernel on the space of components itself, the approach is further extended by restating the previous results in a more efﬁcient and ﬂexible framework using the “kernel trick”. Finally, a constructive approach to such positive deﬁnite kernels through an integral representation theorem is proved, before presenting experimental results on a benchmark experiment of handwritten digits classiﬁcation to illustrate the validity of the approach.

We provide bounds on the generalization error of this learning algorithm in terms of the number of errors and the size of the classiﬁer it ﬁnds on the training data. We also compare its performance on some natural data sets with the set covering machine and the support vector machine. Furthermore, we show that the proposed bounds on the generalization error provide effective guides for model selection.

The new algorithm is empirically evaluated against a full dynamic programming approach and a trie-based algorithm both on synthetic and newswire article data. Based on the experiments, the full dynamic programming approach is the fastest on short strings, and on long strings if the alphabet is small. On large alphabets, the new sparse dynamic programming algorithm is the most efﬁcient. On medium-sized alphabets the trie-based approach is best if the maximum number of allowed gaps is strongly restricted.

<p>Author: David Wingate, Kevin D. Seppi</p><p>Abstract: The performance of value and policy iteration can be dramatically improved by eliminating redundant or useless backups, and by backing up states in the right order. We study several methods designed to accelerate these iterative solvers, including prioritization, partitioning, and variable reordering. We generate a family of algorithms by combining several of the methods discussed, and present extensive empirical evidence demonstrating that performance can improve by several orders of magnitude for many problems, while preserving accuracy and convergence guarantees.

<p>Author: Damien  Ernst, Pierre  Geurts, Louis  Wehenkel</p><p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning aims to determine an optimal control policy from interaction with a system or from observations gathered from a system. In batch mode, it can be achieved by approximating the so-called Q-function based on a set of four-tuples (xt , ut , rt , xt+1 ) where xt denotes the system state at time t, ut the control action taken, rt the instantaneous reward obtained and xt+1 the successor state of the system, and by determining the control policy from this Q-function. The Q-function approximation may be obtained from the limit of a sequence of (batch mode) supervised learning problems. Within this framework we describe the use of several classical tree-based supervised learning methods (CART, Kd-tree, tree bagging) and two newly proposed ensemble algorithms, namely extremely and totally randomized trees. We study their performances on several examples and ﬁnd that the ensemble methods based on regression trees perform well in extracting relevant information about the optimal control policy from sets of four-tuples. In particular, the totally randomized trees give good results while ensuring the convergence of the sequence, whereas by relaxing the convergence constraint even better accuracy results are provided by the extremely randomized trees.

<p>Author: Rong-En Fan, Pai-Hsuen Chen, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: Working set selection is an important step in decomposition methods for training support vector machines (SVMs). This paper develops a new technique for working set selection in SMO-type decomposition methods. It uses second order information to achieve fast convergence. Theoretical properties such as linear convergence are established. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is faster than existing selection methods using ﬁrst order information.

<p>Author: Gunnar Rätsch, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: AdaBoost produces a linear combination of base hypotheses and predicts with the sign of this linear combination. The linear combination may be viewed as a hyperplane in feature space where the base hypotheses form the features. It has been observed that the generalization error of the algorithm continues to improve even after all examples are on the correct side of the current hyperplane. The improvement is attributed to the experimental observation that the distances (margins) of the examples to the separating hyperplane are increasing even after all examples are on the correct side. We introduce a new version of AdaBoost, called AdaBoost∗ , that explicitly maximizes the ν minimum margin of the examples up to a given precision. The algorithm incorporates a current estimate of the achievable margin into its calculation of the linear coefﬁcients of the base hypotheses. The bound on the number of iterations needed by the new algorithms is the same as the number needed by a known version of AdaBoost that must have an explicit estimate of the achievable margin as a parameter. We also illustrate experimentally that our algorithm requires considerably fewer iterations than other algorithms that aim to maximize the margin.</p><p>6 0.22160842 <a title="28-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Large_Margin_Methods_for_Structured_and_Interdependent_Output_Variables.html">42 jmlr-2005-Large Margin Methods for Structured and Interdependent Output Variables</a></p>

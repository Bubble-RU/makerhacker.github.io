The common approach for learning model parameters in such domains is the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. This algorithm, however, can easily get trapped in suboptimal local maxima. Learning the model structure is even more challenging.

<p>Author: Eran Segal, Dana Pe'er, Aviv Regev, Daphne Koller, Nir Friedman</p><p>Abstract: Methods for learning Bayesian networks can discover dependency structure between observed variables. Although these methods are useful in many applications, they run into computational and statistical problems in domains that involve a large number of variables. In this paper,1 we consider a solution that is applicable when many variables have similar behavior. We introduce a new class of models, module networks, that explicitly partition the variables into modules, so that the variables in each module share the same parents in the network and the same conditional probability distribution. We deﬁne the semantics of module networks, and describe an algorithm that learns the modules’ composition and their dependency structure from data. Evaluation on real data in the domains of gene expression and the stock market shows that module networks generalize better than Bayesian networks, and that the learned module network structure reveals regularities that are obscured in learned Bayesian networks. 1.

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Amir Globerson, Naftali Tishby, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: The problem of extracting the relevant aspects of data was previously addressed through the information bottleneck (IB) method, through (soft) clustering one variable while preserving information about another - relevance - variable. The current work extends these ideas to obtain continuous representations that preserve relevant information, rather than discrete clusters, for the special case of multivariate Gaussian variables. While the general continuous IB problem is difﬁcult to solve, we provide an analytic solution for the optimal representation and tradeoff between compression and relevance for the this important case. The obtained optimal representation is a noisy linear projection to eigenvectors of the normalized regression matrix Σx|y Σ−1 , which is also the basis obtained x in canonical correlation analysis. However, in Gaussian IB, the compression tradeoff parameter uniquely determines the dimension, as well as the scale of each eigenvector, through a cascade of structural phase transitions. This introduces a novel interpretation where solutions of different ranks lie on a continuum parametrized by the compression level. Our analysis also provides a complete analytic expression of the preserved information as a function of the compression (the “information-curve”), in terms of the eigenvalue spectrum of the data. As in the discrete case, the information curve is concave and smooth, though it is made of different analytic segments for each optimal dimension. Finally, we show how the algorithmic theory developed in the IB framework provides an iterative algorithm for obtaining the optimal Gaussian projections.

<p>Author: John Winn, Christopher M. Bishop</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian inference is now widely established as one of the principal foundations for machine learning. In practice, exact inference is rarely possible, and so a variety of approximation techniques have been developed, one of the most widely used being a deterministic framework called variational inference. In this paper we introduce Variational Message Passing (VMP), a general purpose algorithm for applying variational inference to Bayesian Networks. Like belief propagation, VMP proceeds by sending messages between nodes in the network and updating posterior beliefs using local operations at each node. Each such update increases a lower bound on the log evidence (unless already at a local maximum). In contrast to belief propagation, VMP can be applied to a very general class of conjugate-exponential models because it uses a factorised variational approximation. Furthermore, by introducing additional variational parameters, VMP can be applied to models containing non-conjugate distributions. The VMP framework also allows the lower bound to be evaluated, and this can be used both for model comparison and for detection of convergence. Variational message passing has been implemented in the form of a general purpose inference engine called VIBES (‘Variational Inference for BayEsian networkS’) which allows models to be speciﬁed graphically and then solved variationally without recourse to coding.

<p>Author: Atsuyoshi Nakamura, Michael Schmitt, Niels Schmitt, Hans Ulrich Simon</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian networks have become one of the major models used for statistical inference. We study the question whether the decisions computed by a Bayesian network can be represented within a low-dimensional inner product space. We focus on two-label classiﬁcation tasks over the Boolean domain. As main results we establish upper and lower bounds on the dimension of the inner product space for Bayesian networks with an explicitly given (full or reduced) parameter collection. In particular, these bounds are tight up to a factor of 2. For some nontrivial cases of Bayesian networks we even determine the exact values of this dimension. We further consider logistic autoregressive Bayesian networks and show that every sufﬁciently expressive inner product space must have dimension at least Ω(n2 ), where n is the number of network nodes. We also derive the bound 2Ω(n) for an artiﬁcial variant of this network, thereby demonstrating the limits of our approach and raising an interesting open question. As a major technical contribution, this work reveals combinatorial and algebraic structures within Bayesian networks such that known methods for the derivation of lower bounds on the dimension of inner product spaces can be brought into play.

<p>Author: Marianthi Markatou, Hong Tian, Shameek Biswas, George Hripcsak</p><p>Abstract: This paper brings together methods from two different disciplines: statistics and machine learning. We address the problem of estimating the variance of cross-validation (CV) estimators of the generalization error. In particular, we approach the problem of variance estimation of the CV estimators of generalization error as a problem in approximating the moments of a statistic. The approximation illustrates the role of training and test sets in the performance of the algorithm. It provides a unifying approach to evaluation of various methods used in obtaining training and test sets and it takes into account the variability due to different training and test sets. For the simple problem of predicting the sample mean and in the case of smooth loss functions, we show that the variance of the CV estimator of the generalization error is a function of the moments of the random T T variables Y = Card(S j S j ) and Y ∗ = Card(Sc Sc ), where S j , S j are two training sets, and Sc , j j j c are the corresponding test sets. We prove that the distribution of Y and Y* is hypergeometric Sj and we compare our estimator with the one proposed by Nadeau and Bengio (2003). We extend these results in the regression case and the case of absolute error loss, and indicate how the methods can be extended to the classiﬁcation case. We illustrate the results through simulation.

<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Nir Friedman</p><p>Abstract: A central challenge in learning probabilistic graphical models is dealing with domains that involve hidden variables. The common approach for learning model parameters in such domains is the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. This algorithm, however, can easily get trapped in suboptimal local maxima. Learning the model structure is even more challenging. The structural EM algorithm can adapt the structure in the presence of hidden variables, but usually performs poorly without prior knowledge about the cardinality and location of the hidden variables. In this work, we present a general approach for learning Bayesian networks with hidden variables that overcomes these problems. The approach builds on the information bottleneck framework of Tishby et al. (1999). We start by proving formal correspondence between the information bottleneck objective and the standard parametric EM functional. We then use this correspondence to construct a learning algorithm that combines an information-theoretic smoothing term with a continuation procedure. Intuitively, the algorithm bypasses local maxima and achieves superior solutions by following a continuous path from a solution of, an easy and smooth, target function, to a solution of the desired likelihood function. As we show, our algorithmic framework allows learning of the parameters as well as the structure of a network. In addition, it also allows us to introduce new hidden variables during model selection and learn their cardinality. We demonstrate the performance of our procedure on several challenging real-life data sets.

<p>Author: Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: A generalized discriminant analysis based on a new optimization criterion is presented. The criterion extends the optimization criteria of the classical Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) when the scatter matrices are singular. An efﬁcient algorithm for the new optimization problem is presented. The solutions to the proposed criterion form a family of algorithms for generalized LDA, which can be characterized in a closed form. We study two speciﬁc algorithms, namely Uncorrelated LDA (ULDA) and Orthogonal LDA (OLDA). ULDA was previously proposed for feature extraction and dimension reduction, whereas OLDA is a novel algorithm proposed in this paper. The features in the reduced space of ULDA are uncorrelated, while the discriminant vectors of OLDA are orthogonal to each other. We have conducted a comparative study on a variety of real-world data sets to evaluate ULDA and OLDA in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy.

<p>Author: Eran Segal, Dana Pe'er, Aviv Regev, Daphne Koller, Nir Friedman</p><p>Abstract: Methods for learning Bayesian networks can discover dependency structure between observed variables. Although these methods are useful in many applications, they run into computational and statistical problems in domains that involve a large number of variables. In this paper,1 we consider a solution that is applicable when many variables have similar behavior. We introduce a new class of models, module networks, that explicitly partition the variables into modules, so that the variables in each module share the same parents in the network and the same conditional probability distribution. We deﬁne the semantics of module networks, and describe an algorithm that learns the modules’ composition and their dependency structure from data. Evaluation on real data in the domains of gene expression and the stock market shows that module networks generalize better than Bayesian networks, and that the learned module network structure reveals regularities that are obscured in learned Bayesian networks. 1.

<p>Author: Alexander T. Ihler, John W. Fisher III, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) is an increasingly popular method of performing approximate inference on arbitrary graphical models. At times, even further approximations are required, whether due to quantization of the messages or model parameters, from other simpliﬁed message or model representations, or from stochastic approximation methods. The introduction of such errors into the BP message computations has the potential to affect the solution obtained adversely. We analyze the effect resulting from message approximation under two particular measures of error, and show bounds on the accumulation of errors in the system. This analysis leads to convergence conditions for traditional BP message passing, and both strict bounds and estimates of the resulting error in systems of approximate BP message passing.

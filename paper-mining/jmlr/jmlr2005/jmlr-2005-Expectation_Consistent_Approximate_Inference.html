</p><p>5 In order to treat systems with a large number of variables, it is therefore necessary to use approximate polynomial complexity inference methods. [sent-18, score-0.143]
</p><p>6 Probably the most prominent and widely developed approximation technique is the socalled variational (or variational Bayes) approximation (see, e. [sent-19, score-0.274]
</p><p>7 In this approach, the true intractable probability distribution is approximated by another one which is optimally chosen within a given, tractable family minimizing the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence as the measure of dissimilarity between distributions. [sent-24, score-0.171]
</p><p>8 We will use the name variational bound for this speciﬁc method because the approximation results in an upper bound to the free energy (an entropic quantity related to the KL divergence). [sent-25, score-0.622]
</p><p>9 The alternative approximation methods discussed in this paper can also be derived from the variation of an approximate free energy which is not necessarily c 2005 Manfred Opper and Ole Winther. [sent-26, score-0.555]
</p><p>10 However, their application in the variational bound approximation is limited to distributions of continuous variables which have the entire real space as their natural domain. [sent-30, score-0.137]
</p><p>11 Recently, a lot of eﬀort has been devoted to the development of approximation techniques which give an improved performance compared to the variational bound approximation. [sent-34, score-0.137]
</p><p>12 EP is based on a dynamical picture where factors—their product forming a global tractable approximate distribution—are iteratively optimized. [sent-36, score-0.119]
</p><p>13 However, while tree-type approximations often work well for sparsely connected graphs they become inadequate for inference problems in a dense graph regardless of the type of variables. [sent-45, score-0.145]
</p><p>14 In this paper we present an alternative view of local-consistency approximations of the EP–type which we call expectation consistent (EC) approximations. [sent-46, score-0.109]
</p><p>15 Our method is a generalization of the adaptive TAP approach (ADATAP) (Opper and Winther, 2001a,b) developed for inference on densely connected graphical models. [sent-48, score-0.131]
</p><p>16 , 2002), we believe that it is more natural and more powerful to base the o derivation on a framework of optimizing a free energy approximation. [sent-54, score-0.485]
</p><p>17 Our paper is organized as follows: Section 2 motivates approximate inference and explains the notation. [sent-56, score-0.143]
</p><p>18 The expectation consistent (EC) approximation to the free energy is derived in Section 3. [sent-57, score-0.584]
</p><p>19 Examples for EC free energies are given in Section 4. [sent-58, score-0.3]
</p><p>20 In a typical scenario, f (x) is expressed as a product of two functions f (x) = fq (x)fr (x) (2) with fq,r (x) ≥ 0, where fq is “simple” enough to allow for tractable computations. [sent-71, score-0.372]
</p><p>21 The goal is to approximate the “complicated” part fr (x) by replacing it with a “simpler” function, say of some exponential form   K  exp λT g(x) ≡ exp   j=1  λj gj (x) . [sent-72, score-0.383]
</p><p>22 2 In such a case, one may alternatively retain fr but replace fq by an approximation of the form eq. [sent-80, score-0.447]
</p><p>23 One would then end up with two types of approximations q(x) = r(x) =  1 fq (x) exp λT g(x) q Zq (λq ) 1 fr (x) exp λT g(x) r Zr (λr )  (4) (5)  for the same density, where Zq (λq ) = dx fq (x) exp λT g(x) . [sent-82, score-0.742]
</p><p>24 We will not assume that q either choice q and r is a reasonably good approximation for the global joint density p(x) as we do in the variational bound approximation. [sent-83, score-0.173]
</p><p>25 Take, as an example, the density p(x) = f (x)/Z = fq (x)fr (x)/Z—with respect to the Lebesgue measure in RN —with fq (x) =  ψi (xi )  (6)  i    fr (x) = exp   xi Jij xj + i  0. [sent-86, score-0.761]

</p><p>27 A greedy single-loop variant of the sequential double-loop algorithm, where the outer loop update is performed after every inner loop update, converged more often without being much slower than the EP-style algorithm. [sent-107, score-0.196]
</p><p>28 Conclusion and Outlook We have introduced a novel method for approximate inference which tries to overcome limitations of previous approximations in dealing with the correlations of random variables. [sent-113, score-0.184]
</p><p>29 We expect that our method becomes most powerful when certain tractable substructures of variables with strong dependencies can be identiﬁed in a model. [sent-117, score-0.121]

</p><p>31 Consider inference on the square grid as a problem where one can introduce tractable substructures without getting a very large increase in complexity. [sent-125, score-0.225]
</p><p>32 This is useful in cases, where an initial three term approximation − ln Z EC = − ln Zq − ln Zr + ln Zs still contains non-tractable component free energies. [sent-261, score-0.887]
</p><p>33 For practical applicability of approximate inference techniques improvements in the numerical implementation of the free energy minimization are crucial. [sent-264, score-0.628]
</p><p>34 In the simulations in this paper we used both single and double loop algorithms. [sent-265, score-0.139]
</p><p>35 In the guaranteed convergent double loop approaches the free energy minimization is formulated in terms of a sequence of convex optimization problems. [sent-271, score-0.655]
</p><p>36 One may calculate corrections to the EC free energy and marginals by a perturbative analysis using cumulant expansions of the approximating distributions. [sent-276, score-0.556]
</p><p>37 Another possible improvement could come from physics of disordered system where methods have be devised to analyze nonergodic free energy landscapes (M´zard et al. [sent-280, score-0.515]
</p><p>38 This will allow to make improved e estimates of the free energy and marginals for example binary variables with large coupling strengths. [sent-282, score-0.556]
</p><p>39 Dual Formulation In this appendix we present an alternative route to EC free energy approximation using a two stage variational formulation. [sent-294, score-0.622]
</p><p>40 The result is the so-called Gibbs free energy which is the Lagragian dual of the Helmholtz free energy eq. [sent-295, score-0.97]
</p><p>41 We introduce the Gibbs free energy (GFE) approach, (see, e. [sent-299, score-0.485]
</p><p>42 We deﬁne the µ Gibbs free energy G(µ ) as µ G(µ ) = min {KL(q, p) | g(x) q  q  = µ } − ln Z . [sent-304, score-0.648]
</p><p>43 (39)  The term ln Z has been subtracted to make the resulting expression independent of the intractable partition function Z. [sent-305, score-0.254]
</p><p>44 µ min G(µ ) = − ln Z  (40)  µ  g(x)  µ = argmin G(µ ) . [sent-307, score-0.163]
</p><p>45 (41)  µ  A variational bound approximation is recovered by restricting the minimization in eq. [sent-308, score-0.137]
</p><p>46 (43) ∂λ In the following, it should be clear from the context when λ is a free variable or is to be determined from eq. [sent-319, score-0.204]
</p><p>47 (42) into the deﬁnition of the Gibbs free energy eq. [sent-322, score-0.485]
</p><p>48 (39), we get the simpler expression: µ µ µµ G(µ ) = − ln Z(λ(µ )) + λT (µ )µ = max − ln Z(λ) + λT µ λ µ showing that G(µ ) is the Lagrangian dual of ln Z(λ). [sent-323, score-0.489]
</p><p>49 Using the notation p(x|t) = f (x,t) (which should not be confused with a conditional probability), we calcuZt µ late the derivative of G(µ , t) using (43) and (44) as for ﬁxed µ : µ dG(µ , t) dt where Z(λ, t) =  = −  ∂ ln Z(λ, t) ∂ ln Z(λ, t) + µ− ∂t ∂λ  dx f (x, t) exp λT g(x) .

</p><p>51 2 An Interpolation Representation of Free Energies If the density p factors into a tractable fq and an intractable part fr , according to eq. [sent-329, score-0.623]
</p><p>52 (2), we can construct a representation of the Gibbs free energy which also separates into two corresponding parts. [sent-330, score-0.485]
</p><p>53 This is done by treating fr (x) as a perturbation which is smoothly turned on using a parameter 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. [sent-331, score-0.27]
</p><p>54 We deﬁne fr (x, t) to be a smooth interpolation between the trivial fr (x, t = 0) = 1 and the “full” intractable fr (x, t = 1) = fr (x). [sent-332, score-1.222]
</p><p>55 The most common choice is to set fr (x, t) = [fr (x)]t , but a more complicated construction can be necessary, when fr contains δ-distributions, see appendix E. [sent-333, score-0.54]
</p><p>56 For later convenience, we have given a subscript to G and ln Z to indicate which approximating distribution µ is being used. [sent-336, score-0.163]
</p><p>57 We can now use the following simple identity for the free energy G(µ , t) 1  µ µ G(µ , 1) − G(µ , 0) =  dt 0  µ dG(µ , t) dt  (49)  µ µ to relate the Gibbs free energy of the intractable model G(µ ) = G(µ , t = 1) and tractable µ, t = 0). [sent-337, score-1.317]
</p><p>58 (20), we get model G(µ µ dG(µ , t) ∂ ln Z(λ, t) =− =− dt ∂t  d ln fr (x, t) dt  . [sent-339, score-0.772]
</p><p>59 (50)  q(x|t)  While this representation can be used to re-derive a variational bound approximation (see Appendix F), we will next re-derive a dual representation of the EC free energy by making an approximation similar in spirit to the one used in Section 3. [sent-340, score-0.653]
</p><p>60 It is deﬁned by r(x|t) =  1 fr (x, t) exp λT g(x) , Zr (λ, t)  (51)  where, as before the parameters λ are chosen in such a way as to guarantee consistency for the expectations of g, i. [sent-344, score-0.307]
</p><p>61 g(x) r(x|t) = µ and Zr (λ, t) =  dx fr (x, t) exp λT g(x) . [sent-346, score-0.335]
</p><p>62 2196  (52)  Expectation Consistent Approximate Inference  Obviously, r(x|t) deﬁnes another Gibbs free energy which in its dual representation eq. [sent-347, score-0.485]
</p><p>63 (44) is given by µ Gr (µ , t) = max − ln Zr (λ, t) + λT µ . [sent-348, score-0.163]
</p><p>64 (49), we make the approximation 1  d ln fr (x, t) dt  dt 0  1 q(x|t)  ≈  dt 0  d ln fr (x, t) dt  . [sent-350, score-1.249]
</p><p>65 (47) and (51) contain the same exponential factor fr (x, t) exp λT g(x) allows us to carry out the integral over the interaction strength t on the right hand side of eq. [sent-352, score-0.307]
</p><p>66 (54) in closed form without specifying the interpolating term fr (x, t) explicitly. [sent-353, score-0.27]

</p><p>69 (19) Using the duality expression for the free energies eq. [sent-361, score-0.3]
</p><p>70 (44), the free energy approximation can be written as µ µ µ µ GEC (µ ) = Gq (µ ) + Gr (µ ) − Gs (µ ) =  (57) T  max min − ln Zq (λq ) − ln Zr (λr ) + ln Zs (λs ) + µ (λq + λr − λs ) λq ,λr λs  ,  µ µ µ µ µ µ where we have deﬁned Gq (µ ) = Gq (µ , 0), Gr (µ ) = Gr (µ , 1) and Gs (µ ) = Gr (µ , 0). [sent-362, score-1.005]
</p><p>71 To obtain the corresponding approximation for the Helmholtz free energy − ln Z, we should minimize this expression with respect to µ. [sent-363, score-0.679]
</p><p>72 However, this natural split allows us to develop a double loop algorithm similar to Yuille (2002); Heskes et al. [sent-372, score-0.139]
</p><p>73 (2003), which is guaranteed to converge to at least one of the stationary points, provided that the EC free energy is bounded from below. [sent-373, score-0.485]
</p><p>74 Hence, this double loop procedure is equivalent to the one deﬁned in Section 5, demonstrating that the sequence F (λs (t)) yields nondecreasing upper bounds to the minimal EC Gibbs free energy. [sent-378, score-0.343]
</p><p>75 Tree-Connected Graphs For the EC tree approximation we will need to make inference on tree-connected graphs. [sent-380, score-0.241]
</p><p>76 Assuming that Λ deﬁnes a tree one can express the free energy in terms of single- and two-node free energies (Yedidia et al. [sent-383, score-0.891]

</p><p>78 The two-node  partition function Zij is given by Zij (λ(ij) ) =  2  2  dxi dxj ψi (xi )ψj (xj )eγi xi +γj xj −Λij xi xj −Λii xi /2−Λjj xj /2 . [sent-385, score-0.378]
</p><p>79 By solving the max condition we can write the Lagrange parameters in terms of the mean values mi = xi and covariances χij = xi xj − mi mj . [sent-389, score-0.353]
</p><p>80 This will be useful when we derive algorithms for optimizing the free energy in section 5 where we need to solve for λ in terms of µ . [sent-390, score-0.485]
</p><p>81 Finally, we will also need to make inference about the mean values and covariances on the tree for the binary variables. [sent-392, score-0.21]
</p><p>82 The mean values and correlations are given by   mi = tanh θi +  xi xj  =  e−Λij  j,(ij)∈G  r(ij)→i   cosh(θi\j + θj\i ) − eΛij cosh(θi\j − θj\i ) . [sent-397, score-0.293]

</p><p>93 Re-deriving the Variational Bound Approximation The choice fr (x, t) = t ln fr (x) for the interpolation can be used for a perturbation expansion µ of the free energy G(µ , t) in powers of t, where at the end one sets t = 1. [sent-435, score-1.239]

<p>Author: John Winn, Christopher M. Bishop</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian inference is now widely established as one of the principal foundations for machine learning. In practice, exact inference is rarely possible, and so a variety of approximation techniques have been developed, one of the most widely used being a deterministic framework called variational inference. In this paper we introduce Variational Message Passing (VMP), a general purpose algorithm for applying variational inference to Bayesian Networks. Like belief propagation, VMP proceeds by sending messages between nodes in the network and updating posterior beliefs using local operations at each node. Each such update increases a lower bound on the log evidence (unless already at a local maximum). In contrast to belief propagation, VMP can be applied to a very general class of conjugate-exponential models because it uses a factorised variational approximation. Furthermore, by introducing additional variational parameters, VMP can be applied to models containing non-conjugate distributions. The VMP framework also allows the lower bound to be evaluated, and this can be used both for model comparison and for detection of convergence. Variational message passing has been implemented in the form of a general purpose inference engine called VIBES (‘Variational Inference for BayEsian networkS’) which allows models to be speciﬁed graphically and then solved variationally without recourse to coding.

<p>Author: Fabio Aiolli, Alessandro Sperduti</p><p>Abstract: Winner-take-all multiclass classiﬁers are built on the top of a set of prototypes each representing one of the available classes. A pattern is then classiﬁed with the label associated to the most ‘similar’ prototype. Recent proposal of SVM extensions to multiclass can be considered instances of the same strategy with one prototype per class. The multi-prototype SVM proposed in this paper extends multiclass SVM to multiple prototypes per class. It allows to combine several vectors in a principled way to obtain large margin decision functions. For this problem, we give a compact constrained quadratic formulation and we propose a greedy optimization algorithm able to ﬁnd locally optimal solutions for the non convex objective function. This algorithm proceeds by reducing the overall problem into a series of simpler convex problems. For the solution of these reduced problems an efﬁcient optimization algorithm is proposed. A number of pattern selection strategies are then discussed to speed-up the optimization process. In addition, given the combinatorial nature of the overall problem, stochastic search strategies are suggested to escape from local minima which are not globally optimal. Finally, we report experiments on a number of datasets. The performance obtained using few simple linear prototypes is comparable to that obtained by state-of-the-art kernel-based methods but with a signiﬁcant reduction (of one or two orders) in response time.

<p>Author: Onno Zoeter, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning two regimes (we have a normal and a prefault regime in mind) based on a train set of non-Markovian observation sequences. Key to the model is that we assume that once the system switches from the normal to the prefault regime it cannot restore and will eventually result in a fault. We refer to the particular setting as semi-supervised since we assume the only information given to the learner is whether a particular sequence ended with a stop (implying that the sequence was generated by the normal regime) or with a fault (implying that there was a switch from the normal to the fault regime). In the latter case the particular time point at which a switch occurred is not known. The underlying model used is a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS). The constraints in the regime transition probabilities result in an exact inference procedure that scales quadratically with the length of a sequence. Maximum aposteriori (MAP) parameter estimates can be found using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with this inference algorithm in the E-step. For long sequences this will not be practically feasible and an approximate inference and an approximate EM procedure is called for.

<p>Author: Evgeny Drukh, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We show several high-probability concentration bounds for learning unigram language models. One interesting quantity is the probability of all words appearing exactly k times in a sample of size m. A standard estimator for this quantity is the Good-Turing estimator. The existing analysis on k its error shows a high-probability bound of approximately O √m . We improve its dependency on k to O √ 4 √k m k + m . We also analyze the empirical frequencies estimator, showing that with high probability its error is bounded by approximately O 2 −5 which has an error of approximately O m 1 k + √ k m . We derive a combined estimator, , for any k. A standard measure for the quality of a learning algorithm is its expected per-word log-loss. The leave-one-out method can be used for estimating the log-loss of the unigram model. We show 1 that its error has a high-probability bound of approximately O √m , for any underlying distribution. We also bound the log-loss a priori, as a function of various parameters of the distribution. Keywords: Good-Turing estimators, logarithmic loss, leave-one-out estimation, Chernoff bounds 1. Introduction and Overview Natural language processing (NLP) has developed rapidly over the last decades. It has a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, optical character recognition, text categorization and many more. The theoretical analysis has also advanced signiﬁcantly, though many fundamental questions remain unanswered. One clear challenge, both practical and theoretical, concerns deriving stochastic models for natural languages. Consider a simple language model, where the distribution of each word in the text is assumed to be independent. Even for such a simplistic model, fundamental questions relating sample size to the learning accuracy are already challenging. This is mainly due to the fact that the sample size is almost always insufﬁcient, regardless of how large it is. To demonstrate this phenomena, consider the following example. We would like to estimate the distribution of ﬁrst names in the university. For that, we are given the names list of a graduate seminar: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dan, Eve, Frank, two Georges, and two Henries. How can we use this sample to estimate the distribution of students’ ﬁrst names? An empirical frequency estimator would c 2005 Evgeny Drukh and Yishay Mansour. D RUKH AND M ANSOUR assign Alice the probability of 0.1, since there is one Alice in the list of 10 names, while George, appearing twice, would get estimation of 0.2. Unfortunately, unseen names, such as Michael, will get an estimation of 0. Clearly, in this simple example the empirical frequencies are unlikely to estimate well the desired distribution. In general, the empirical frequencies estimate well the probabilities of popular names, but are rather inaccurate for rare names. Is there a sample size, which assures us that all the names (or most of them) will appear enough times to allow accurate probabilities estimation? The distribution of ﬁrst names can be conjectured to follow the Zipf’s law. In such distributions, there will be a signiﬁcant fraction of rare items, as well as a considerable number of non-appearing items, in any sample of reasonable size. The same holds for the language unigram models, which try to estimate the distribution of single words. As it has been observed empirically on many occasions (Chen, 1996; Curran and Osborne, 2002), there are always many rare words and a considerable number of unseen words, regardless of the sample size. Given this observation, a fundamental issue is to estimate the distribution the best way possible. 1.1 Good-Turing Estimators An important quantity, given a sample, is the probability mass of unseen words (also called “the missing mass”). Several methods exist for smoothing the probability and assigning probability mass to unseen items. The almost standard method for estimating the missing probability mass is the Good-Turing estimator. It estimates the missing mass as the total number of unique items, divided by the sample size. In the names example above, the Good-Turing missing mass estimator is equal 0.6, meaning that the list of the class names does not reﬂect the true distribution, to put it mildly. The Good-Turing estimator can be extended for higher orders, that is, estimating the probability of all names appearing exactly k times. Such estimators can also be used for estimating the probability of individual words. The Good-Turing estimators dates back to World War II, and were published ﬁrst in 1953 (Good, 1953, 2000). It has been extensively used in language modeling applications since then (Katz, 1987; Church and Gale, 1991; Chen, 1996; Chen and Goodman, 1998). However, their theoretical convergence rate in various models has been studied only in the recent years (McAllester and Schapire, 2000, 2001; Kutin, 2002; McAllester and Ortiz, 2003; Orlitsky et al., 2003). For estimation of the probability of all words appearing exactly k times in a sample of size m, McAllester and Schapire k (2000) derive a high probability bound on Good-Turing estimator error of approximately O √m . One of our main results improves the dependency on k of this bound to approximately O √ 4 √k + k m m √ k 1 k+ m , We also show that the empirical frequencies estimator has an error of approximately O for large values of k. Based on the two estimators, we derive a combined estimator with an error of √ 4 2 k approximately O m− 5 , for any k. We also derive a weak lower bound of Ω √m for an error of any estimator based on an independent sample. Our results give theoretical justiﬁcation for using the Good-Turing estimator for small values of k, and the empirical frequencies estimator for large values of k. Though in most applications the Good-Turing estimator is used for very small values of k, for example k ≤ 5, as by Katz (1987) or Chen (1996), we show that it is fairly accurate in a much wider range. 1232 . C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS 1.2 Logarithmic Loss The Good-Turing estimators are used to approximate the probability mass of all the words with a certain frequency. For many applications, estimating this probability mass is not the main optimization criteria. Instead, a certain distance measure between the true and the estimated distributions needs to be minimized. The most popular distance measure used in NLP applications is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. For a true distribution P = {px }, and an estimated distribution Q = {qx }, both over some px set X, this measure is deﬁned as ∑x px ln qx . An equivalent measure, up to the entropy of P, is the 1 logarithmic loss (log-loss), which equals ∑x px ln qx . Many NLP applications use the value of log-loss to evaluate the quality of the estimated distribution. However, the log-loss cannot be directly calculated, since it depends on the underlying distribution, which is unknown. Therefore, estimating log-loss using the sample is important, although the sample cannot be independently used for both estimating the distribution and testing it. The hold-out estimation splits the sample into two parts: training and testing. The training part is used for learning the distribution, whereas the testing sample is used for evaluating the average per-word log-loss. The main disadvantage of this method is the fact that it uses only part of the available information for learning, whereas in practice one would like to use all the sample. A widely used general estimation method is called leave-one-out. Basically, it performs averaging all the possible estimations, where a single item is chosen for testing, and the rest are used for training. This procedure has an advantage of using the entire sample, and in addition it is rather simple and usually can be easily implemented. The existing theoretical analysis of the leave-oneout method (Holden, 1996; Kearns and Ron, 1999) shows general high probability concentration bounds for the generalization error. However, these techniques are not applicable in our setting. 1 We show that the leave-one-out estimation error for the log-loss is approximately O √m , for any underlying distribution and a general family of learning algorithms. It gives a theoretical justiﬁcation for effective use of leave-one-out estimation for the log-loss. We also analyze the concentration of the log-loss itself, not based of an empirical measure. We address the characteristics of the underlying distribution affecting the log-loss. We ﬁnd such a characteristic, deﬁning a tight bound for the log-loss value. 1.3 Model and Semantics We denote the set of all words as V , and N = |V |. Let P be a distribution over V , where pw is the probability of a word w ∈ V . Given a sample S of size m, drawn i.i.d. using P, we denote the number of appearances of a word w in S as cS , or simply cw , when a sample S is clear from the context.1 We w deﬁne Sk = {w ∈ V : cS = k}, and nk = |Sk |. w For a claim Φ regarding a sample S, we write ∀δ S Φ[S] for P(Φ[S]) ≥ 1 − δ. For some error c ˜ bound function f (·), which holds with probability 1 − δ, we write O( f (·)) for O f (·) ln m , δ where c > 0 is some constant. 1.4 Paper Organization Section 2 shows several standard concentration inequalities, together with their technical applications regarding the maximum-likelihood approximation. Section 3 shows the error bounds for the 1. Unless mentioned otherwise, all further sample-dependent deﬁnitions depend on the sample S. 1233 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR k-hitting mass estimation. Section 4 bounds the error for the leave-one-out estimation of the logarithmic loss. Section 5 shows the bounds for the a priori logarithmic loss. Appendix A includes the technical proofs. 2. Concentration Inequalities In this section we state several standard Chernoff-style concentration inequalities. We also show some of their corollaries regarding the maximum-likelihood approximation of pw by pw = cw . ˆ m Lemma 1 (Hoeffding, 1963) Let Y = Y1 , . . . ,Yn be a set of n independent random variables, such that Yi ∈ [bi , bi + di ]. Then, for any ε > 0, P ∑ Yi − E ∑ Yi i >ε i ≤ 2 exp − 2ε2 ∑i di2 . The next lemma is a variant of an extension of Hoeffding’s inequality, by McDiarmid (1989). Lemma 2 Let Y = Y1 , . . . ,Yn be a set of n independent random variables, and f (Y ) such that any change of Yi value changes f (Y ) by at most di , that is sup ∀ j=i,Y j =Y j (| f (Y ) − f (Y )|) ≤ di . Let d = maxi di . Then, ∀δY : | f (Y ) − E[ f (Y )]| ≤ d n ln 2 δ . 2 Lemma 3 (Angluin and Valiant, 1979) Let Y = Y1 , . . . ,Yn be a set of n independent random variables, where Yi ∈ [0, B]. Let µ = E [∑i Yi ]. Then, for any ε > 0, P ∑ Yi < µ − ε ≤ exp − ε2 , 2µB ∑ Yi > µ + ε ≤ exp − ε2 . (2µ + ε)B i P i Deﬁnition 4 (Dubhashi and Ranjan, 1998) A set of random variables Y1 , . . . ,Yn is called “negatively associated”, if it satisﬁes for any two disjoint subsets I and J of {1, . . . , n}, and any two non-decreasing, or any two non-increasing, functions f from R|I| to R and g from R|J| to R: E[ f (Yi : i ∈ I)g(Y j : j ∈ J)] ≤ E[ f (Yi : i ∈ I)]E[g(Y j : j ∈ J)]. The next lemma is based on the negative association analysis. It follows directly from Theorem 14 and Proposition 7 of Dubhashi and Ranjan (1998). 1234 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS Lemma 5 For any set of N non-decreasing, or N non-increasing functions { fw : w ∈ V }, any Chernoff-style bound on ∑w∈V fw (cw ), pretending that cw are independent, is valid. In particular, Lemmas 1 and 2 apply for {Y1 , ...,Yn } = { fw (cw ) : w ∈ V }. The next lemma shows an explicit upper bound on the binomial distribution probability.2 Lemma 6 Let X ∼ Bin(n, p) be a sum of n i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with p ∈ (0, 1). Let 1 µ = E[X] = np. For x ∈ (0, n], there exists some function Tx = exp 12x + O x12 , such that ∀k ∈ Tn 1 {0, . . . , n}, we have P(X = k) ≤ √ Tµ Tn−µ . For integral values of µ, the equality is achieved 2πµ(1−p) at k = µ. (Note that for x ≥ 1, we have Tx = Θ(1).) The next lemma deals with the number of successes in independent trials. Lemma 7 (Hoeffding, 1956) Let Y1 , . . . ,Yn ∈ {0, 1} be a sequence of independent trials, with pi = 1 E[Yi ]. Let X = ∑i Yi be the number of successes, and p = n ∑i pi be the average trial success probability. For any integers b and c such that 0 ≤ b ≤ np ≤ c ≤ n, we have c ∑ k=b n k p (1 − p)n−k ≤ P (b ≤ X ≤ c) ≤ 1. k Using the above lemma, the next lemma shows a general concentration bound for a sum of arbitrary real-valued functions of a multinomial distribution components. We show that with a small penalty, any Chernoff-style bound pretending the components being independent is valid.3 We recall that cS , or equivalently cw , is the number of appearances of the word w in a sample S of w size m. Lemma 8 Let {cw ∼ Bin(m, pw ) : w ∈ V } be independent binomial random variables. Let { fw (x) : w ∈ V } be a set of real valued functions. Let F = ∑w fw (cw ) and F = ∑w fw (cw ). For any ε > 0, √ P (|F − E [F]| > ε) ≤ 3 m P F − E F >ε . The following lemmas provide concentration bounds for maximum-likelihood estimation of pw by pw = cw . The ﬁrst lemma shows that words with “high” probability have a “high” count in the ˆ m sample. Lemma 9 Let δ > 0, and λ ≥ 3. We have ∀δ S: ∀w ∈ V, s.t. mpw ≥ 3 ln 2m , δ |mpw − cw | ≤ ∀w ∈ V, s.t. mpw > λ ln 2m , δ cw > 1− 3mpw ln 3 λ 2m ; δ mpw . 2. Its proof is based on Stirling approximation directly, though local limit theorems could be used. This form of bound is needed for the proof of Theorem 30. 3. The negative association analysis (Lemma 5) shows that a sum of monotone functions of multinomial distribution components must obey Chernoff-style bounds pretending that the components are independent. In some sense, our result extends this notion, since it does not require the functions to be monotone. 1235 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR The second lemma shows that words with “low” probability have a “low” count in the sample. Lemma 10 Let δ ∈ (0, 1), and m > 1. Then, ∀δ S: ∀w ∈ V such that mpw ≤ 3 ln m , we have cw ≤ δ 6 ln m . δ The following lemma derives the bound as a function of the count in the sample (and not as a function of the unknown probability). Lemma 11 Let δ > 0. Then, ∀δ S: cw > 18 ln 4m , δ ∀w ∈ V, s.t. |mpw − cw | ≤ 6cw ln 4m . δ The following is a general concentration bound. Lemma 12 For any δ > 0, and any word w ∈ V , we have ∀δ S, cw − pw < m 3 ln 2 δ . m The following lemma bounds the probability of words that do not appear in the sample. Lemma 13 Let δ > 0. Then, ∀δ S: ∀w ∈ S, / mpw < ln m . δ 3. K-Hitting Mass Estimation In this section our goal is to estimate the probability of the set of words appearing exactly k times in the sample, which we call “the k-hitting mass”. We analyze the Good-Turing estimator, the empirical frequencies estimator, and a combined estimator. ˆ Deﬁnition 14 We deﬁne the k-hitting mass Mk , its empirical frequencies estimator Mk , and its 4 Good-Turing estimator Gk as Mk = ∑ w∈Sk pw ˆ Mk = k nk m Gk = k+1 nk+1 . m−k The outline of this section is as follows. Deﬁnition 16 slightly redeﬁnes the k-hitting mass and its estimators. Lemma 17 shows that this redeﬁnition has a negligible inﬂuence. Then, we analyze the estimation errors using the concentration inequalities from Section 2. Lemmas 20 and 21 bound the expectation of the Good-Turing estimator error, following McAllester and Schapire (2000). Lemma 23 bounds the deviation of the error, using the negative association analysis. A tighter bound, based on Lemma 8, is achieved at Theorem 25. Theorem 26 analyzes the error of the empirical frequencies estimator. Theorem 29 refers to the combined estimator. Finally, Theorem 30 shows a weak lower bound for the k-hitting mass estimation. 4. The Good-Turing estimator is usually deﬁned as ( k+1 )nk+1 . The two deﬁnitions are almost identical for small values m k of k, as their quotient equals 1 − m . Following McAllester and Schapire (2000), our deﬁnition makes the calculations slightly simpler. 1236 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS Deﬁnition 15 For any w ∈ V and i ∈ {0, · · · , m}, we deﬁne Xw,i as a random variable equal 1 if cw = i, and 0 otherwise. The following deﬁnition concentrates on words whose frequencies are close to their probabilities. Deﬁnition 16 Let α > 0 and k > 3α2 . We deﬁne Ik,α = pw ∈ Ik,α }. We deﬁne: Mk,α = ∑ pw = w∈Sk ∩Vk,α ∑ √ √ k−α k k+1+α k+1 m , m , and Vk,α = {w ∈ V : pw Xw,k , w∈Vk,α Gk,α = k+1 k+1 |Sk+1 ∩Vk,α | = ∑ Xw,k+1 , m−k m − k w∈Vk,α ˆ Mk,α = k k |Sk ∩Vk,α | = ∑ Xw,k . m m w∈Vk,α By Lemma 11, for large values of k the redeﬁnition coincides with the original deﬁnition with high probability: Lemma 17 For δ > 0, let α = ˆ ˆ and Mk = Mk,α . 6 ln 4m . For k > 18 ln 4m , we have ∀δ S: Mk = Mk,α , Gk = Gk,α , δ δ Proof By Lemma 11, we have ∀δ S, ∀w : cw > 18 ln 4m , δ |mpw − cw | ≤ 6cw ln √ 4m = α cw . δ This means that any word w with cw = k has √ √ √ k−α k k+α k k+1+α k+1 ≤ pw ≤ < . m m m √ ˆ Therefore w ∈ Vk,α , completing the proof for Mk and Mk . Since α < k, any word w with cw = k + 1 has √ √ √ k−α k k+1−α k+1 k+1+α k+1 < ≤ pw ≤ , m m m which yields w ∈ Vk,α , completing the proof for Gk . Since the minimal probability of a word in Vk,α is Ω Lemma 18 Let α > 0 and k > 3α2 . Then, |Vk,α | = O 1237 m k k m . , we derive: D RUKH AND M ANSOUR Proof We have α < √ √k . 3 Any word w ∈ Vk,α has pw ≥ |Vk,α | < √ k−α k m > k m 1 1 − √3 . Therefore, m m 1 , =O 1 k 1− √ k 3 which completes the proof. Using Lemma 6, we derive: Lemma 19 Let α > 0 and 3α2 < k ≤ m . Let w ∈ Vk,α . Then, E[Xw,k ] = P(cw = k) = O 2 1 √ k . Proof Since cw ∼ Bin(m, pw ) is a binomial random variable, we use Lemma 6: E[Xw,k ] = P(cw = k) ≤ Tm 1 . 2πmpw (1 − pw ) Tmpw Tm(1−pw ) For w ∈ Vk,α , we have mpw = Ω(k), which implies 3α2 < k ≤ m 2, Tm Tmpw Tm(1−pw ) we have 1 2πmpw (1 − pw ) ≤ = O(1). Since pw ∈ Ik,α and 1 √ 2π k − α k √ k+1+α k+1 m 1− 1 < 1 2πk 1 − √3 1 1 − k+1 1 + √3 m 1 < 1 2πk 1 − √3 1− 1 2 1 +m 1 1 + √3 1 = O √ , k which completes the proof. 3.1 Good-Turing Estimator The following lemma, directly based on the deﬁnition of the binomial distribution, was shown in Theorem 1 of McAllester and Schapire (2000). Lemma 20 For any k < m, and w ∈ V , we have pw P(cw = k) = k+1 P(cw = k + 1)(1 − pw ). m−k The following lemma bounds the expectations of the redeﬁned k-hitting mass, its Good-Turing estimator, and their difference. 1238 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS Lemma 21 Let α > 0 and 3α2 < k < |E[Gk,α ] − E[Mk,α ]| = O √ k m m 2.

Since {bwYw,k } and {bw Zw,k } are monotone with respect to {cw }, Lemma 5 applies for them. This means that the concentration of their sum is at least as tight as if they were independent.

Leave-One-Out Estimation of Log-Loss Many NLP applications use log-loss as the learning performance criteria. Since the log-loss depends on the underlying probability P, its value cannot be explicitly calculated, and must be approximated. The main result of this section, Theorem 32, is an upper bound on the leave-one-out estimation of the log-loss, assuming a general family of learning algorithms. Given a sample S = {s1 , . . . , sm }, the goal of a learning algorithm is to approximate the true probability P by some probability Q. We denote the probability assigned by the learning algorithm to a word w by qw . Deﬁnition 31 We assume that any two words with equal sample frequency are assigned equal probabilities in Q, and therefore denote qw by q(cw ). Let the log-loss of a distribution Q be L = 1 1 ∑ pw ln qw = ∑ Mk ln q(k) . w∈V k≥0 Let the leave-one-out estimation, qw , be the probability assigned to w, when one of its instances is removed. We assume that any two words with equal sample frequency are assigned equal leaveone-out probability estimation, and therefore denote qw by q (cw ). We deﬁne the leave-one-out estimation of the log-loss as averaging the loss of each sample word, when it is extracted from the sample and pretended to be the test sample: 1243 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR ∑ Lleave−one = w∈V cw knk 1 1 =∑ ln ln . m qw k>0 m q (k) 1 1 Let Lw = L(cw ) = ln q(cw ) , and Lw = L (cw ) = ln q (cw ) .

Assuming an accuracy parameter δ, we require the following properties to hold: 1. Starting from a certain number of appearances, the estimation is close to the sample frequency.

It bounds the deviation between the between the true loss and the leave one out estimate. This bound shows that for a general family of learning algorithms, leave-one-out technique can be effectively used to estimate the logarithmic loss, given the sample only. The estimation error bound decreases roughly in proportion to the square root of the sample size, regardless of the underlying distribution. 1244 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS Theorem 32 For a learning algorithm satisfying Equations (10), (11), and (12), and δ > 0, we have: δ ∀ S, |L − Lleave−one | = O Lmax (ln m )4 ln δ m ln m δ δ . The proof of Theorem 32 bounds the estimation error separately for the high-probability and low-probability words. We use Lemma 20 (McAllester and Schapire, 2000) to bound the estimation error for low-probability words. The expected estimation error for the high-probability words is bounded elementarily using the deﬁnition of the binomial distribution (Lemma 33). Finally, we use McDiarmid’s inequality (Lemma 2) to bound its deviation. The next lemma shows that the expectation of the leave-one-out method is a good approximation for the per-word expectation of the logarithmic loss. Lemma 33 Let 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, and y ≥ 1. Let Bn ∼ Bin(n, p) be a binomial random variable. Let fy (x) = ln(max(x, y)). Then, 0 ≤ E p fy (Bn − α) − 3p Bn fy (Bn − α − 1) ≤ . n n Proof For a real valued function F (here F(x) = fy (x − α)), we have: E Bn F(Bn − 1) n n = ∑ x=0 n = p∑ x=1 n x x p (1 − p)n−x F(x − 1) x n n − 1 x−1 p (1 − p)(n−1)−(x−1) F(x − 1) x−1 = pE[F(Bn−1 )] , where we used n x x n = E p fy (Bn − α) − n−1 x−1 . Since Bn ∼ Bn−1 + B1 , we have: Bn fy (Bn − α − 1) n = p(E[ fy (Bn−1 + B1 − α)] − E[ fy (Bn−1 − α)]) max(Bn−1 + B1 − α, y) max(Bn−1 − α, y) max(Bn−1 − α + B1 , y + B1 ) ≤ pE ln max(Bn−1 − α, y) B1 = pE ln(1 + ) max(Bn−1 − α, y) B1 ≤ pE . max(Bn−1 − α, y) = pE ln Since B1 and Bn−1 are independent, we get 1245 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR pE B1 1 = pE[B1 ]E max(Bn−1 − α, y) max(Bn−1 − α, y) 1 = p2 E max(Bn−1 − α, y) n−1 = p2 ∑ n−1 x 1 p (1 − p)n−1−x x max(x − α, y) = p2 ∑ x+1 1 n−1 x p (1 − p)n−1−x x + 1 max(x − α, y) x x=0 n−1 x=0 ≤ ≤ n−1 p x+1 n max px+1 (1 − p)n−(x+1) ∑ n x max(x − α, y) x=0 x + 1 3p 3p (1 − (1 − p)n ) < . (13) n n Equation (13) follows by the following observation: x + 1 ≤ 3(x − α) for x ≥ 2, and x + 1 ≤ 2y for x ≤ 1. Finally, pE ln max(Bn−1 −α+B1 ,y) ≥ 0, which implies the lower bound of the lemma. max(Bn−1 −α,y) The following lemma bounds n2 as a function of n1 . Lemma 34 Let δ > 0.

Suppose that a word u is replaced by a word v. This results in decrease H for cu , and increase for cv . Recalling that yw = Ω(mpw ), the change of Erru , as well as the change H , is bounded by O ln m , as follows: of Errv m m−β The change of pu ln max(cu −α,yu ) would be 0 if cu − α ≤ yu .

D RUKH AND M ANSOUR The proof follows by combining Equations (16), (19), and (27). 5. Log-Loss A Priori Section 4 bounds the error of the leave-one-out estimation of the log-loss. It shows that the log-loss can be effectively estimated, for a general family of learning algorithms. Another question to be considered is the log-loss distribution itself, without the empirical estimation. That is, how large (or low) is it expected to be, and which parameters of the distribution affect it. We denote the learning error (equivalent to the log-loss) as the KL-divergence between the true and the estimated distribution. We refer to a general family of learning algorithms, and show lower and upper bounds for the learning error. The upper bound (Theorem 39) can be divided to three parts. The ﬁrst part is the missing mass. The other two build a trade-off between a threshold (lower thresholds leads to a lower bound), and the number of words with probability exceeding this threshold (fewer words lead to a lower bound). It seems that this number of words is a necessary lower bound, as we show at Theorem 35. 1 Theorem 35 Let the distribution be uniform: ∀w ∈ V : pw = N , with N m. Also, suppose that the learning algorithm just uses maximum-likelihood approximation, meaning qw = cw . Then, a typical m learning error would be Ω( N ). m The proof of Theorem 35 bases on the Pinsker inequality (Lemma 36). It ﬁrst shows a lower bound for L1 norm between the true and the expected distributions, and then transforms it to the form of the learning error. Lemma 36 (Pinsker Inequality) Given any two distributions P and Q, we have 1 KL(P||Q) ≥ (L1 (P, Q))2 . 2 Theorem 35 Proof We ﬁrst show that L1 (P, Q) concentrates near Ω N m . Then, we use Pinsker inequality to show lower bound5 of KL(P||Q). First we ﬁnd a lower bound for E[|pw − qw |]. Since cw is a binomial random variable, σ2 [cw ] = m mpw (1 − pw ) = Ω N , and with some constant probability, |cw − mpw | > σ[cw ]. Therefore, we have E[|qw − pw |] = ≥ E 1 E[|cw − mpw |] m 1 1 σ[cw ]P(|cw − mpw | > σ[cw ]) = Ω m m ∑ |pw − qw | w∈V = Ω N√ 1 mN =Ω 1 =Ω √ mN m N N m . 5. This proof does not optimize the constants. Asymptotic analysis of logarithmic transform of binomial variables by Flajolet (1999) can be used to achieve explicit values for KL(P||Q). 1250 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS 2 A single change in the sample changes L1 (P, Q) by at most m . Using McDiarmid inequality 1 (Lemma 2) on L1 (P, Q) as a function of sample words, we have ∀ 2 S: L1 (P, Q) ≥ E[L1 (P, Q)] − |L1 (P, Q) − E[L1 (P, Q)]| √ N m N −O =Ω . = Ω m m m Using Pinsker inequality (Lemma 36), we have 1 2 ∀ S, pw 1 ∑ pw ln qw ≥ 2 w∈V 2 ∑ |pw − qw | =Ω w∈V N , m which completes the proof. Deﬁnition 37 Let α ∈ (0, 1) and τ ≥ 1. We deﬁne an (absolute discounting) algorithm Aα,τ , which α “removes” m probability mass from words appearing at most τ times, and uniformly spreads it among the unseen words. We denote by n1...τ = ∑τ ni the number of words with count between 1 i=1 and τ. The learned probability Q is deﬁned by :  αn1...τ cw = 0  mn0 cw −α qw = 1 ≤ cw ≤ τ m  cw τ < cw . m The α parameter can be set to some constant, or to make the missing mass match the Good1...τ Turing missing mass estimator, that is αnm = n1 . m Deﬁnition 38 Given a distribution P, and x ∈ [0, 1], let Fx = ∑w∈V :pw ≤x pw , and Nx = |{w ∈ V : pw > x}|. Clearly, for any distribution P, Fx is a monotone function of x, varying from 0 to 1, and Nx is a monotone function of x, varying from N to 0. Note that Nx is bounded by 1 . x The next theorem shows an upper bound for the learning error. √ Theorem 39 For any δ > 0 and λ > 3, such that τ < (λ − 3λ) ln 8m , the learning error of Aα,τ is δ bounded ∀δ S by pw 0 ≤ ∑ pw ln qw w∈V ≤ M0 ln + n0 ln 4m δ αn1...τ α F 8m + 1 − α λ lnm δ 1251  λ ln 8m δ  + 1−α  3 ln 8 δ + M0  m 3 ln 8 3λ ln 8m δ δ + √ N λ ln 8m . √ δ m 2( λ − 3)2 m m D RUKH AND M ANSOUR The proof of Theorem 39 bases directly on Lemmas 40, 41, and 43. We can rewrite this bound roughly as Nλ λ ˜ ≤ O M0 + √ + m m m pw qw ∑ pw ln w∈V . This bound implies the characteristics of the distribution inﬂuencing the log-loss. It shows that a “good” distribution can involve many low-probability words, given that the missing mass is low. However, the learning error would increase if the dictionary included many mid-range3 probability words. For example, if a typical word’s probability were m− 4 , the bound would become 1 ˜ O M0 + m− 4 . Lemma 40 For any δ > 0, the learning error for non-appearing words can be bounded with high probability by ∑ ∀δ S, pw ln w∈S / pw qw ≤ M0 ln n0 ln m δ αn1...τ .

Also, the distribution of {cw } given that m = m is identical to the distribution of {cw }, therefore the distribution of F given that m = m is identical to the distribution of F. We have P(|F − E[F ]| > ε) = ∑ P(m i = i)P(|F − E[F ]| > ε|m = i) ≥ P(m = m)P(|F − E[F ]| > ε|m = m) = P(m = m)P(|F − E[F]| > ε) 1 √ P(|F − E[F]| > ε), ≥ 3 m which completes the proof.

The ﬁrst claim follows δ using Lemma 44 together with union bound over all these words (with accuracy m for each word). Using the ﬁrst claim, we derive the second. We show a lower bound for 3pw ln 2m δ > pw − pw m cw ≥ pw − m 3 = λ 1− 3 λ cw m, using ln 2m δ m 1 < λ pw : pw . The ﬁnal inequality follows from simple algebra. Lemma 10 Proof Let b = 3 ln( m ). Note that δ ∈ [0, 1] and m > 1 yield b > 2. First, suppose that δ b there are up to m words with pw ≤ m . For each such word, we apply Lemma 3 on cw , with ε = b. We have: P cw > 6 ln m b2 ≤ P (cw > mpw + ε) ≤ exp − δ 2mpw + b ≤ δ . m Since we assume that there are up to m such words, the total mistake probability is δ. Now we assume the general case, that is, without any assumption on the number of words. Our goal is to reduce the problem to the former conditions, that is, to create a set of size m of words with b probability smaller than m . We ﬁrst create m empty sets v1 , . . . , vm . Let the probability of each set vi , pvi , be the sum of the probabilities of all the words it includes. Let the actual count of vi , cvi , be the sum of the sample counts of all the words w it includes. We divide all the words w between these sets in a bin-packing-approximation manner. We sort the words w in decreasing probability order. Then, we do the following loop: insert the next word w to the set vi with the currently smallest pvi . b We claim that pvi ≤ m for each vi at the end of the loop. If this inequality does not hold, then b some word w made this “overﬂow” ﬁrst. Obviously, pw must be smaller than 2m , otherwise it would b be one of the ﬁrst 2m < m words ordered, and would enter an empty set. If pw < 2m and it made b b an “overﬂow”, then the probability of each set at the moment w was entered must exceed 2m , since w must have entered the lightest set available. This means that the total probability of all words b entered by that moment was greater than m 2m > 1. Applying the case of m words to the sets v1 , . . . , vm , we have ∀δ S: for every vi , cvi ≤ 2b. Also, if the count of each set vi does not exceed 2b, so does the count of each word w ∈ vi .

Let n2 = |U ∩ S2 | and n1 = |U ∩ S1 |. Let b = ln m . δ δ First, we show that E[n2 ] = O(bE[n1 ]).

<p>Author: Jaakko Särelä, Harri Valpola</p><p>Abstract: A new algorithmic framework called denoising source separation (DSS) is introduced. The main beneﬁt of this framework is that it allows for the easy development of new source separation algorithms which can be optimised for speciﬁc problems. In this framework, source separation algorithms are constructed around denoising procedures. The resulting algorithms can range from almost blind to highly specialised source separation algorithms. Both simple linear and more complex nonlinear or adaptive denoising schemes are considered. Some existing independent component analysis algorithms are reinterpreted within the DSS framework and new, robust blind source separation algorithms are suggested. The framework is derived as a one-unit equivalent to an EM algorithm for source separation. However, in the DSS framework it is easy to utilise various kinds of denoising procedures which need not be based on generative models. In the experimental section, various DSS schemes are applied extensively to artiﬁcial data, to real magnetoencephalograms and to simulated CDMA mobile network signals. Finally, various extensions to the proposed DSS algorithms are considered. These include nonlinear observation mappings, hierarchical models and over-complete, nonorthogonal feature spaces. With these extensions, DSS appears to have relevance to many existing models of neural information processing.

<p>Author: Luís B. Almeida</p><p>Abstract: When acquiring an image of a paper document, the image printed on the back page sometimes shows through. The mixture of the front- and back-page images thus obtained is markedly nonlinear, and thus constitutes a good real-life test case for nonlinear blind source separation. This paper addresses a difﬁcult version of this problem, corresponding to the use of “onion skin” paper, which results in a relatively strong nonlinearity of the mixture, which becomes close to singular in the lighter regions of the images. The separation is achieved through the MISEP technique, which is an extension of the well known INFOMAX method. The separation results are assessed with objective quality measures. They show an improvement over the results obtained with linear separation, but have room for further improvement.

<p>Author: Onno Zoeter, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning two regimes (we have a normal and a prefault regime in mind) based on a train set of non-Markovian observation sequences. Key to the model is that we assume that once the system switches from the normal to the prefault regime it cannot restore and will eventually result in a fault. We refer to the particular setting as semi-supervised since we assume the only information given to the learner is whether a particular sequence ended with a stop (implying that the sequence was generated by the normal regime) or with a fault (implying that there was a switch from the normal to the fault regime). In the latter case the particular time point at which a switch occurred is not known. The underlying model used is a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS). The constraints in the regime transition probabilities result in an exact inference procedure that scales quadratically with the length of a sequence. Maximum aposteriori (MAP) parameter estimates can be found using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with this inference algorithm in the E-step. For long sequences this will not be practically feasible and an approximate inference and an approximate EM procedure is called for. We describe a Ä?Ĺš&sbquo;exible class of approximations corresponding to different choices of clusters in a Kikuchi free energy with weak consistency constraints.

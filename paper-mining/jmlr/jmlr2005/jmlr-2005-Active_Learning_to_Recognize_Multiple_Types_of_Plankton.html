<p>Author: Rie Kubota Ando, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: One of the most important issues in machine learning is whether one can improve the performance of a supervised learning algorithm by including unlabeled data. Methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data are generally referred to as semi-supervised learning. Although a number of such methods are proposed, at the current stage, we still don’t have a complete understanding of their eﬀectiveness. This paper investigates a closely related problem, which leads to a novel approach to semi-supervised learning. Speciﬁcally we consider learning predictive structures on hypothesis spaces (that is, what kind of classiﬁers have good predictive power) from multiple learning tasks. We present a general framework in which the structural learning problem can be formulated and analyzed theoretically, and relate it to learning with unlabeled data. Under this framework, algorithms for structural learning will be proposed, and computational issues will be investigated. Experiments will be given to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the semi-supervised learning setting.</p><p>3 0.067365289 <a title="9-tfidf-3" href="./jmlr-2005-Separating_a_Real-Life_Nonlinear_Image_Mixture.html">65 jmlr-2005-Separating a Real-Life Nonlinear Image Mixture</a></p>
<p>Author: Luís B. Almeida</p><p>Abstract: When acquiring an image of a paper document, the image printed on the back page sometimes shows through. The mixture of the front- and back-page images thus obtained is markedly nonlinear, and thus constitutes a good real-life test case for nonlinear blind source separation. This paper addresses a difﬁcult version of this problem, corresponding to the use of “onion skin” paper, which results in a relatively strong nonlinearity of the mixture, which becomes close to singular in the lighter regions of the images. The separation is achieved through the MISEP technique, which is an extension of the well known INFOMAX method. The separation results are assessed with objective quality measures. They show an improvement over the results obtained with linear separation, but have room for further improvement.

The computing cost then becomes the limiting factor. Any efﬁcient learning algorithm should at least take a brief look at each example. But should all examples be given equal attention? This contribution proposes an empirical answer. We ﬁrst present an online SVM algorithm based on this premise. LASVM yields competitive misclassiﬁcation rates after a single pass over the training examples, outspeeding state-of-the-art SVM solvers.

<p>Author: Ivor W. Tsang, James T. Kwok, Pak-Ming Cheung</p><p>Abstract: O(m3 ) Standard SVM training has time and O(m2 ) space complexities, where m is the training set size. It is thus computationally infeasible on very large data sets. By observing that practical SVM implementations only approximate the optimal solution by an iterative strategy, we scale up kernel methods by exploiting such “approximateness” in this paper. We ﬁrst show that many kernel methods can be equivalently formulated as minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problems in computational geometry. Then, by adopting an efﬁcient approximate MEB algorithm, we obtain provably approximately optimal solutions with the idea of core sets. Our proposed Core Vector Machine (CVM) algorithm can be used with nonlinear kernels and has a time complexity that is linear in m and a space complexity that is independent of m. Experiments on large toy and realworld data sets demonstrate that the CVM is as accurate as existing SVM implementations, but is much faster and can handle much larger data sets than existing scale-up methods. For example, CVM with the Gaussian kernel produces superior results on the KDDCUP-99 intrusion detection data, which has about ﬁve million training patterns, in only 1.4 seconds on a 3.2GHz Pentium–4 PC.

Experimental results indicate that our approach often requires signiﬁcantly less labeled images to reach a given accuracy than the approach of labeling the least certain test example and random sampling. It can also be applied in batch mode resulting in an accuracy comparable to labeling one image at a time and retraining.

<p>Author: John Lafferty, Guy Lebanon</p><p>Abstract: A family of kernels for statistical learning is introduced that exploits the geometric structure of statistical models. The kernels are based on the heat equation on the Riemannian manifold deﬁned by the Fisher information metric associated with a statistical family, and generalize the Gaussian kernel of Euclidean space. As an important special case, kernels based on the geometry of multinomial families are derived, leading to kernel-based learning algorithms that apply naturally to discrete data. Bounds on covering numbers and Rademacher averages for the kernels are proved using bounds on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds. Experimental results are presented for document classiﬁcation, for which the use of multinomial geometry is natural and well motivated, and improvements are obtained over the standard use of Gaussian or linear kernels, which have been the standard for text classiﬁcation.

<p>Author: Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of ﬁnding an optimal kernel from a prescribed convex set of kernels K for learning a real-valued function by regularization. We establish for a wide variety of regularization functionals that this leads to a convex optimization problem and, for square loss regularization, we characterize the solution of this problem. We show that, although K may be an uncountable set, the optimal kernel is always obtained as a convex combination of at most m + 2 basic kernels, where m is the number of data examples. In particular, our results apply to learning the optimal radial kernel or the optimal dot product kernel.</p><p>5 0.61764288 <a title="9-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Fast_Kernel_Classifiers_with_Online_and_Active_Learning.html">33 jmlr-2005-Fast Kernel Classifiers with Online and Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Antoine Bordes, Seyda Ertekin, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou</p><p>Abstract: Very high dimensional learning systems become theoretically possible when training examples are abundant. The computing cost then becomes the limiting factor. Any efﬁcient learning algorithm should at least take a brief look at each example. But should all examples be given equal attention? This contribution proposes an empirical answer. We ﬁrst present an online SVM algorithm based on this premise. LASVM yields competitive misclassiﬁcation rates after a single pass over the training examples, outspeeding state-of-the-art SVM solvers. Then we show how active example selection can yield faster training, higher accuracies, and simpler models, using only a fraction of the training example labels.</p><p>6 0.55740803 <a title="9-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Core_Vector_Machines%3A_Fast_SVM_Training_on_Very_Large_Data_Sets.html">24 jmlr-2005-Core Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets</a></p>

<p>Author: Rie Kubota Ando, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: One of the most important issues in machine learning is whether one can improve the performance of a supervised learning algorithm by including unlabeled data. Methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data are generally referred to as semi-supervised learning. Although a number of such methods are proposed, at the current stage, we still don’t have a complete understanding of their eﬀectiveness. This paper investigates a closely related problem, which leads to a novel approach to semi-supervised learning. Speciﬁcally we consider learning predictive structures on hypothesis spaces (that is, what kind of classiﬁers have good predictive power) from multiple learning tasks. We present a general framework in which the structural learning problem can be formulated and analyzed theoretically, and relate it to learning with unlabeled data. Under this framework, algorithms for structural learning will be proposed, and computational issues will be investigated. Experiments will be given to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the semi-supervised learning setting.</p><p>3 0.028961323 <a title="8-tfidf-3" href="./jmlr-2005-Large_Margin_Methods_for_Structured_and_Interdependent_Output_Variables.html">42 jmlr-2005-Large Margin Methods for Structured and Interdependent Output Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Tsochantaridis, Thorsten Joachims, Thomas Hofmann, Yasemin Altun</p><p>Abstract: Learning general functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output spaces is one of the key challenges in computational intelligence. While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing ﬂexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classiﬁcation algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classiﬁcation problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.</p><p>4 0.028425494 <a title="8-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2005-Variational_Message_Passing.html">71 jmlr-2005-Variational Message Passing</a></p>
<p>Author: John Winn, Christopher M. Bishop</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian inference is now widely established as one of the principal foundations for machine learning. In practice, exact inference is rarely possible, and so a variety of approximation techniques have been developed, one of the most widely used being a deterministic framework called variational inference. In this paper we introduce Variational Message Passing (VMP), a general purpose algorithm for applying variational inference to Bayesian Networks. Like belief propagation, VMP proceeds by sending messages between nodes in the network and updating posterior beliefs using local operations at each node. Each such update increases a lower bound on the log evidence (unless already at a local maximum). In contrast to belief propagation, VMP can be applied to a very general class of conjugate-exponential models because it uses a factorised variational approximation. Furthermore, by introducing additional variational parameters, VMP can be applied to models containing non-conjugate distributions. The VMP framework also allows the lower bound to be evaluated, and this can be used both for model comparison and for detection of convergence. Variational message passing has been implemented in the form of a general purpose inference engine called VIBES (‘Variational Inference for BayEsian networkS’) which allows models to be speciﬁed graphically and then solved variationally without recourse to coding.

<p>Author: Juho Rousu, John Shawe-Taylor</p><p>Abstract: We present a sparse dynamic programming algorithm that, given two strings s and t, a gap penalty λ, and an integer p, computes the value of the gap-weighted length-p subsequences kernel. The algorithm works in time O(p|M| log |t|), where M = {(i, j)|si = t j } is the set of matches of characters in the two sequences. The algorithm is easily adapted to handle bounded length subsequences and different gap-penalty schemes, including penalizing by the total length of gaps and the number of gaps as well as incorporating character-speciﬁc match/gap penalties. The new algorithm is empirically evaluated against a full dynamic programming approach and a trie-based algorithm both on synthetic and newswire article data. Based on the experiments, the full dynamic programming approach is the fastest on short strings, and on long strings if the alphabet is small. On large alphabets, the new sparse dynamic programming algorithm is the most efﬁcient. On medium-sized alphabets the trie-based approach is best if the maximum number of allowed gaps is strongly restricted.

<p>Author: Tong Luo, Kurt Kramer, Dmitry B. Goldgof, Lawrence O. Hall, Scott Samson, Andrew Remsen, Thomas Hopkins</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an active learning method which reduces the labeling effort of domain experts in multi-class classiﬁcation problems. Active learning is applied in conjunction with support vector machines to recognize underwater zooplankton from higher-resolution, new generation SIPPER II images. Most previous work on active learning with support vector machines only deals with two class problems. In this paper, we propose an active learning approach “breaking ties” for multiclass support vector machines using the one-vs-one approach with a probability approximation. Experimental results indicate that our approach often requires signiﬁcantly less labeled images to reach a given accuracy than the approach of labeling the least certain test example and random sampling. It can also be applied in batch mode resulting in an accuracy comparable to labeling one image at a time and retraining.

<p>Author: Hal Daumé III, Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for tackling the supervised clustering problem, the generic problem encountered in tasks such as reference matching, coreference resolution, identity uncertainty and record linkage. Our clustering model is based on the Dirichlet process prior, which enables us to deﬁne distributions over the countably inﬁnite sets that naturally arise in this problem. We add supervision to our model by positing the existence of a set of unobserved random variables (we call these “reference types”) that are generic across all clusters. Inference in our framework, which requires integrating over inﬁnitely many parameters, is solved using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors. We present a simple—but general—parameterization of our model based on a Gaussian assumption. We evaluate this model on one artiﬁcial task and three real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Our results show that our model is able to outperform other models across a variety of tasks and performance metrics.

The computing cost then becomes the limiting factor. Any efﬁcient learning algorithm should at least take a brief look at each example. But should all examples be given equal attention? This contribution proposes an empirical answer. We ﬁrst present an online SVM algorithm based on this premise. LASVM yields competitive misclassiﬁcation rates after a single pass over the training examples, outspeeding state-of-the-art SVM solvers. Then we show how active example selection can yield faster training, higher accuracies, and simpler models, using only a fraction of the training example labels.</p><p>3 0.22813782 <a title="8-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2005-Diffusion_Kernels_on_Statistical_Manifolds.html">26 jmlr-2005-Diffusion Kernels on Statistical Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: John Lafferty, Guy Lebanon</p><p>Abstract: A family of kernels for statistical learning is introduced that exploits the geometric structure of statistical models. The kernels are based on the heat equation on the Riemannian manifold deﬁned by the Fisher information metric associated with a statistical family, and generalize the Gaussian kernel of Euclidean space. As an important special case, kernels based on the geometry of multinomial families are derived, leading to kernel-based learning algorithms that apply naturally to discrete data. Bounds on covering numbers and Rademacher averages for the kernels are proved using bounds on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds. Experimental results are presented for document classiﬁcation, for which the use of multinomial geometry is natural and well motivated, and improvements are obtained over the standard use of Gaussian or linear kernels, which have been the standard for text classiﬁcation.

<p>Author: Gunnar Rätsch, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: AdaBoost produces a linear combination of base hypotheses and predicts with the sign of this linear combination. The linear combination may be viewed as a hyperplane in feature space where the base hypotheses form the features. It has been observed that the generalization error of the algorithm continues to improve even after all examples are on the correct side of the current hyperplane. The improvement is attributed to the experimental observation that the distances (margins) of the examples to the separating hyperplane are increasing even after all examples are on the correct side. We introduce a new version of AdaBoost, called AdaBoost∗ , that explicitly maximizes the ν minimum margin of the examples up to a given precision. The algorithm incorporates a current estimate of the achievable margin into its calculation of the linear coefﬁcients of the base hypotheses. The bound on the number of iterations needed by the new algorithms is the same as the number needed by a known version of AdaBoost that must have an explicit estimate of the achievable margin as a parameter. We also illustrate experimentally that our algorithm requires considerably fewer iterations than other algorithms that aim to maximize the margin.</p><p>5 0.22516465 <a title="8-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Learning_a_Mahalanobis_Metric_from_Equivalence_Constraints.html">46 jmlr-2005-Learning a Mahalanobis Metric from Equivalence Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Aharon Bar-Hillel, Tomer Hertz, Noam Shental, Daphna Weinshall</p><p>Abstract: Many learning algorithms use a metric deﬁned over the input space as a principal tool, and their performance critically depends on the quality of this metric. We address the problem of learning metrics using side-information in the form of equivalence constraints. Unlike labels, we demonstrate that this type of side-information can sometimes be automatically obtained without the need of human intervention. We show how such side-information can be used to modify the representation of the data, leading to improved clustering and classiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, we present the Relevant Component Analysis (RCA) algorithm, which is a simple and efﬁcient algorithm for learning a Mahalanobis metric. We show that RCA is the solution of an interesting optimization problem, founded on an information theoretic basis. If dimensionality reduction is allowed within RCA, we show that it is optimally accomplished by a version of Fisher’s linear discriminant that uses constraints. Moreover, under certain Gaussian assumptions, RCA can be viewed as a Maximum Likelihood estimation of the within class covariance matrix. We conclude with extensive empirical evaluations of RCA, showing its advantage over alternative methods.

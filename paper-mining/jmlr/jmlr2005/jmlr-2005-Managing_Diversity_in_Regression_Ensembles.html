<p>Author: Lior Wolf, Amnon Shashua</p><p>Abstract: The problem of selecting a subset of relevant features in a potentially overwhelming quantity of data is classic and found in many branches of science. Examples in computer vision, text processing and more recently bio-informatics are abundant. In text classiﬁcation tasks, for example, it is not uncommon to have 104 to 107 features of the size of the vocabulary containing word frequency counts, with the expectation that only a small fraction of them are relevant. Typical examples include the automatic sorting of URLs into a web directory and the detection of spam email. In this work we present a deﬁnition of “relevancy” based on spectral properties of the Laplacian of the features’ measurement matrix. The feature selection process is then based on a continuous ranking of the features deﬁned by a least-squares optimization process. A remarkable property of the feature relevance function is that sparse solutions for the ranking values naturally emerge as a result of a “biased non-negativity” of a key matrix in the process. As a result, a simple leastsquares optimization process converges onto a sparse solution, i.e., a selection of a subset of features which form a local maximum over the relevance function. The feature selection algorithm can be embedded in both unsupervised and supervised inference problems and empirical evidence show that the feature selections typically achieve high accuracy even when only a small fraction of the features are relevant.</p><p>4 0.081272647 <a title="54-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2005-Tree-Based_Batch_Mode_Reinforcement_Learning.html">68 jmlr-2005-Tree-Based Batch Mode Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Damien  Ernst, Pierre  Geurts, Louis  Wehenkel</p><p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning aims to determine an optimal control policy from interaction with a system or from observations gathered from a system. In batch mode, it can be achieved by approximating the so-called Q-function based on a set of four-tuples (xt , ut , rt , xt+1 ) where xt denotes the system state at time t, ut the control action taken, rt the instantaneous reward obtained and xt+1 the successor state of the system, and by determining the control policy from this Q-function. The Q-function approximation may be obtained from the limit of a sequence of (batch mode) supervised learning problems. Within this framework we describe the use of several classical tree-based supervised learning methods (CART, Kd-tree, tree bagging) and two newly proposed ensemble algorithms, namely extremely and totally randomized trees. We study their performances on several examples and ﬁnd that the ensemble methods based on regression trees perform well in extracting relevant information about the optimal control policy from sets of four-tuples. In particular, the totally randomized trees give good results while ensuring the convergence of the sequence, whereas by relaxing the convergence constraint even better accuracy results are provided by the extremely randomized trees.

<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Nir Friedman</p><p>Abstract: A central challenge in learning probabilistic graphical models is dealing with domains that involve hidden variables. The common approach for learning model parameters in such domains is the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. This algorithm, however, can easily get trapped in suboptimal local maxima. Learning the model structure is even more challenging. The structural EM algorithm can adapt the structure in the presence of hidden variables, but usually performs poorly without prior knowledge about the cardinality and location of the hidden variables. In this work, we present a general approach for learning Bayesian networks with hidden variables that overcomes these problems. The approach builds on the information bottleneck framework of Tishby et al. (1999). We start by proving formal correspondence between the information bottleneck objective and the standard parametric EM functional. We then use this correspondence to construct a learning algorithm that combines an information-theoretic smoothing term with a continuation procedure. Intuitively, the algorithm bypasses local maxima and achieves superior solutions by following a continuous path from a solution of, an easy and smooth, target function, to a solution of the desired likelihood function. As we show, our algorithmic framework allows learning of the parameters as well as the structure of a network. In addition, it also allows us to introduce new hidden variables during model selection and learn their cardinality. We demonstrate the performance of our procedure on several challenging real-life data sets.

<p>Author: Gavin Brown, Jeremy L. Wyatt, Peter Tiňo</p><p>Abstract: Ensembles are a widely used and effective technique in machine learning—their success is commonly attributed to the degree of disagreement, or ‘diversity’, within the ensemble. For ensembles where the individual estimators output crisp class labels, this ‘diversity’ is not well understood and remains an open research issue. For ensembles of regression estimators, the diversity can be exactly formulated in terms of the covariance between individual estimator outputs, and the optimum level is expressed in terms of a bias-variance-covariance trade-off. Despite this, most approaches to learning ensembles use heuristics to encourage the right degree of diversity. In this work we show how to explicitly control diversity through the error function. The ﬁrst contribution of this paper is to show that by taking the combination mechanism for the ensemble into account we can derive an error function for each individual that balances ensemble diversity with individual accuracy. We show the relationship between this error function and an existing algorithm called negative correlation learning, which uses a heuristic penalty term added to the mean squared error function. It is demonstrated that these methods control the bias-variance-covariance trade-off systematically, and can be utilised with any estimator capable of minimising a quadratic error function, for example MLPs, or RBF networks. As a second contribution, we derive a strict upper bound on the coefﬁcient of the penalty term, which holds for any estimator that can be cast in a generalised linear regression framework, with mild assumptions on the basis functions. Finally we present the results of an empirical study, showing signiﬁcant improvements over simple ensemble learning, and ﬁnding that this technique is competitive with a variety of methods, including boosting, bagging, mixtures of experts, and Gaussian processes, on a number of tasks.

<p>Author: Wei Chu, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic kernel approach to ordinal regression based on Gaussian processes. A threshold model that generalizes the probit function is used as the likelihood function for ordinal variables. Two inference techniques, based on the Laplace approximation and the expectation propagation algorithm respectively, are derived for hyperparameter learning and model selection. We compare these two Gaussian process approaches with a previous ordinal regression method based on support vector machines on some benchmark and real-world data sets, including applications of ordinal regression to collaborative ﬁltering and gene expression analysis. Experimental results on these data sets verify the usefulness of our approach.

<p>Author: Ioannis Tsochantaridis, Thorsten Joachims, Thomas Hofmann, Yasemin Altun</p><p>Abstract: Learning general functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output spaces is one of the key challenges in computational intelligence. While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing ﬂexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classiﬁcation algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classiﬁcation problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.</p><p>4 0.3227703 <a title="54-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2005-Loopy_Belief_Propagation%3A_Convergence_and_Effects_of_Message_Errors.html">52 jmlr-2005-Loopy Belief Propagation: Convergence and Effects of Message Errors</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander T. Ihler, John W. Fisher III, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) is an increasingly popular method of performing approximate inference on arbitrary graphical models. At times, even further approximations are required, whether due to quantization of the messages or model parameters, from other simpliﬁed message or model representations, or from stochastic approximation methods. The introduction of such errors into the BP message computations has the potential to affect the solution obtained adversely. We analyze the effect resulting from message approximation under two particular measures of error, and show bounds on the accumulation of errors in the system. This analysis leads to convergence conditions for traditional BP message passing, and both strict bounds and estimates of the resulting error in systems of approximate BP message passing.

<p>Author: John Winn, Christopher M. Bishop</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian inference is now widely established as one of the principal foundations for machine learning. In practice, exact inference is rarely possible, and so a variety of approximation techniques have been developed, one of the most widely used being a deterministic framework called variational inference. In this paper we introduce Variational Message Passing (VMP), a general purpose algorithm for applying variational inference to Bayesian Networks. Like belief propagation, VMP proceeds by sending messages between nodes in the network and updating posterior beliefs using local operations at each node. Each such update increases a lower bound on the log evidence (unless already at a local maximum). In contrast to belief propagation, VMP can be applied to a very general class of conjugate-exponential models because it uses a factorised variational approximation. Furthermore, by introducing additional variational parameters, VMP can be applied to models containing non-conjugate distributions. The VMP framework also allows the lower bound to be evaluated, and this can be used both for model comparison and for detection of convergence. Variational message passing has been implemented in the form of a general purpose inference engine called VIBES (‘Variational Inference for BayEsian networkS’) which allows models to be speciﬁed graphically and then solved variationally without recourse to coding.

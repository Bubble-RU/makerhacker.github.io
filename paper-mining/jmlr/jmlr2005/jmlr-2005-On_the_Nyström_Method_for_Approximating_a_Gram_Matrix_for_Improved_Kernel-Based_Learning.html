Mahoney</p><p>Abstract: A problem for many kernel-based methods is that the amount of computation required to ﬁnd the solution scales as O(n3 ), where n is the number of training examples. We develop and analyze an algorithm to compute an easily-interpretable low-rank approximation to an n × n Gram matrix G such that computations of interest may be performed more rapidly. The approximation is of ˜ the form Gk = CWk+CT , where C is a matrix consisting of a small number c of columns of G and Wk is the best rank-k approximation to W , the matrix formed by the intersection between those c columns of G and the corresponding c rows of G. An important aspect of the algorithm is the probability distribution used to randomly sample the columns; we will use a judiciously-chosen and data-dependent nonuniform probability distribution. Let · 2 and · F denote the spectral norm and the Frobenius norm, respectively, of a matrix, and let Gk be the best rank-k approximation to G. We prove that by choosing O(k/ε4 ) columns G −CWk+CT ξ ≤ G − Gk ξ +ε n ∑ G2 , ii i=1 both in expectation and with high probability, for both ξ = 2, F, and for all k : 0 ≤ k ≤ rank(W ). This approximation can be computed using O(n) additional space and time, after making two passes over the data from external storage.

</p><p>7 Although in many cases the features are chosen such that the Gram matrix is sparse, in which case sparse matrix computation methods may be used, in other applications the Gram matrix is dense, but is well approximated by a low-rank matrix. [sent-54, score-0.246]
</p><p>8 In this case, calculations of interest (such as the matrix inversion needed in GP prediction, the quadratic programming problem for SVMs, and the computation of the eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix) will still generally take space which is O(n2 ) and time which is O(n3 ).

</p><p>11 The columns are chosen in c independent random trials (and thus with replacement) according to a judiciously-chosen and data-dependent nonuniform probability distribution. [sent-68, score-0.119]
</p><p>12 The nonuniform probability distribution will be carefully chosen and will be important for the provable bounds we obtain. [sent-69, score-0.106]
</p><p>13 Finally, it extends random sampling methodology of the authors to a new application domain and it extends the ability of those methods from simply extracting linear structure of the data to extracting linear structure while respecting nonlinear structures such as the SPSD property.

</p><p>17 The three matrices U, V , and Σ constitute the singular value decomposition (SVD) of A. [sent-112, score-0.135]
</p><p>18 An n × n matrix A is a symmetric positive semideﬁnite (SPSD) matrix if A is symmetric and xT Ax ≥ 0 for all nonzero vectors x. [sent-114, score-0.164]
</p><p>19 From the perturbation theory of matrices it is known that the size of the difference between two matrices can be used to bound the difference between the singular value spectrum of the two matrices (Stewart and Sun, 1990; Bhatia, 1997). [sent-116, score-0.164]
</p><p>20 When this algorithm is given as input a matrix, A ∈ Rm×n , a probability distribution {pi }n , and a number c ≤ n, it returns as output i=1 a matrix C ∈ Rm×c (such that CCT ≈ AAT ) whose columns are c randomly-chosen and suitablyrescaled columns of A. [sent-130, score-0.246]
</p><p>21 An important aspect of this algorithm is the probability distribution {pi }n i=1 used to choose columns of A. [sent-131, score-0.082]
</p><p>22 Although one could always use a uniform distribution to choose the columns to form the matrix C, superior results are obtained if the probabilities are chosen judiciously. [sent-132, score-0.194]
</p><p>23 Sampling probabilities of the form (8), that depend on the lengths squared of the columns of A, are the optimal sampling probabilities for approximating AAT by CCT , in a sense made precise in Drineas, Kannan, and Mahoney (2004a). [sent-133, score-0.194]
</p><p>24 Note also that although we studied random sampling with replacement for ease of analysis, it is not known how to compute efﬁciently optimal nonuniform sampling probabilities when the sampling is performed without replacement. [sent-135, score-0.252]
</p><p>25 It is an algorithm which, when given a matrix A ∈ Rm×n , uses O(m + n) additional space and time to compute an approximation to the top k singular values and the corresponding left singular vectors of A. [sent-144, score-0.271]
</p><p>26 This theorem holds for any set of sampling probabilities, but the best bounds are obtained when probabilities of the form (8) are used, in which case Theorem 2 may be combined with Theorem 1. [sent-147, score-0.098]

</p><p>29 Then, deﬁne the n × n Gram matrix G as G = X T X. [sent-157, score-0.082]
</p><p>30 Thus, G is a SPSD matrix and Gi j = (X (i) , X ( j) ) is the dot product between the data vectors X (i) and X ( j) . [sent-158, score-0.103]
</p><p>31 In this section, two algorithms are presented that compute such an approximation to a Gram matrix G. [sent-162, score-0.099]
</p><p>32 It is an algorithm that takes as input an n × n Gram matrix G and returns as output an approximate decomposition of ˜ the form G = CW +CT , where C and W are as in Williams and Seeger (2001), and where W + is the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of W . [sent-175, score-0.105]
</p><p>33 The c columns are chosen uniformly at random and with replacement. [sent-176, score-0.082]
</p><p>34 • Let C be the n × c matrix containing the sampled columns. [sent-191, score-0.1]
</p><p>35 The M AIN A PPROXIMATION algorithm takes as input an n × n Gram matrix G, a probability distribution {pi }n , a number c ≤ n of columns to choose, and a rank parameter i=1 ˜ k ≤ c. [sent-199, score-0.203]
</p><p>36 To implement this algorithm, two passes over the Gram matrix G from external storage and O(n), i. [sent-201, score-0.082]

</p><p>38 Note that if the sampling probabilities of the form pi = G2 / ∑n G2 are used, as in Theorem 3 below, then one may store the m × n data matrix X in i=1 ii ii external storage, in which case only those elements of G that are used in the approximation need to be computed. [sent-207, score-0.282]
</p><p>39 In the simplest application of this algorithm, one could choose k = c, in which case Wk = W , and ˜ the decomposition is of the form G = CW +CT , where W + is the exact Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of the matrix W . [sent-208, score-0.105]
</p><p>40 , it may amplify noise present in the low singular values. [sent-211, score-0.086]
</p><p>41 Note that, as a function of increasing k, the Frobenius norm bound (11) of Theorem 2 is not necessarily optimal for 2160  ¨ O N THE N YSTR OM M ETHOD FOR A PPROXIMATING A G RAM M ATRIX  : n × n Gram matrix G, {pi }n such that ∑n pi = 1, c ≤ n, and k ≤ c. [sent-212, score-0.164]

</p><p>43 Also, although the bounds of Theorem 3 for the spectral norm for k ≤ rank(W ) are in general worse than those for k = rank(W ), the former are of interest since our algorithms hold for any input Gram matrix and we make no assumptions about a model for the noise in the data. [sent-224, score-0.141]
</p><p>44 The sampling matrix formalism of Drineas, Kannan, and Mahoney (2004a) is used in the proofs of Theorem 3 in Section 4. [sent-225, score-0.134]
</p><p>45 Let us deﬁne the sampling matrix S ∈ Rn×c to be the zero-one matrix where Si j = 1 if the i-th column of A is chosen in the j-th independent random trial and Si j = 0 otherwise. [sent-227, score-0.234]
</p><p>46 Similarly, deﬁne the rescaling matrix D ∈ Rc×c to √ be the diagonal matrix with Dtt = 1/ cpit . [sent-228, score-0.214]
</p><p>47 Then the n × c matrix C = GSD √ consists of the chosen columns of G, each of which has been rescaled by 1/ cpit , where it is the label of the column chosen in the t-th independent trial. [sent-229, score-0.245]

</p><p>52 In the uniform sampling case, pi = 1/n, the diagonal elements of the rescaling matrix D are all n/c, and these all cancel out of the expression. [sent-240, score-0.228]

</p><p>55 nonuniform sampling case, C is a rescaled version of the columns of G and W is a rescaled version of the intersection of those columns with the corresponding rows. [sent-250, score-0.362]
</p><p>56 Alternatively, one can view C as consisting of the actual columns of G, without rescaling, and W as consisting of the intersection of those columns with the corresponding rows, again without rescaling, in the following manner. [sent-251, score-0.233]
</p><p>57 ˜ Theorem 3 Suppose G is an n×n SPSD matrix, let k ≤ c be a rank parameter, and let Gk = CWk+CT be constructed from the M AIN A PPROXIMATION algorithm of Algorithm 2 by sampling c columns of G with probabilities {pi }n such that i=1 n  pi = G2 / ∑ G2 . [sent-257, score-0.268]
</p><p>58 Second, the sampling probabilities used in Thoerem 3 may be written 2 as pi = X (i) / X 2 , which only depend on dot products from the data matrix X. [sent-264, score-0.25]
</p><p>59 Intuitively, this difﬁculty arises since it is difﬁcult to identify structure in a matrix to ensure the SPSD property, unless, e. [sent-271, score-0.082]

</p><p>61 3 Proof of Theorem 3 Since G = X T X it follows that both the left and the right singular vectors of G are equal to the right singular vectors of X and that the singular values of G are the squares of the singular values of X. [sent-277, score-0.344]

</p><p>65 Instead of exactly computing the left singular vectors ˆ U of X, we can approximate them by Uk , computed from a column sample of X, and use this to ˜ compute an approximation G to G. [sent-286, score-0.121]
</p><p>66 Thus, W = V Σ2V and Wk = V Σ2V T , ˆ where Σk is the diagonal matrix with the top k singular values of CX on the diagonal and the remainˆˆ ˆ ˆˆˆ der set to 0. [sent-290, score-0.168]

</p><p>74 Although it is by no means necessary that the set of o Nystr¨ m points is coincident with the set of quadrature points, they are often chosen to be so since o in that case if the kernel K(·, ·) is symmetric then the matrix k(·, ·) in (38) is symmetric. [sent-343, score-0.118]

</p><p>82 2 Relationship to the Randomized Singular Value Decompositions Recall that the L INEART IME SVD of Drineas, Kannan, and Mahoney (2004b) computes exactly the low-dimensional singular vectors of C. [sent-372, score-0.086]
</p><p>83 1 since although sampling is used to construct the matrix C a second level of sampling is never performed to construct A11 . [sent-376, score-0.186]
</p><p>84 On the other hand, the C ONSTANT T IME SVD algorithm of Drineas, Kannan, and Mahoney (2004b) (and thus the algorithm of Frieze, Kannan, and Vempala, 1998) is similar except that it approximates the low-dimensional singular vectors of C. [sent-377, score-0.086]
</p><p>85 These eigenvectors are then 11 ¯ ˜ Nystr¨ m-extended via (42) to vectors U (denoted by H in Drineas, Kannan, and Mahoney (2004b)) o that approximate the left singular vectors of A. [sent-379, score-0.108]
</p><p>86 Second, and relatedly, in this algorithm there are two levels of sampling, and only the ﬁrst depends directly on the elements of the matrix A; the second depends on the lengths of the rows of C. [sent-387, score-0.123]
</p><p>87 Thus, in general, the matrix A11 does not consist of the same rows as columns, even if A is a SPSD matrix. [sent-388, score-0.123]
</p><p>88 A CUR decomposition is a low-rank matrix decomposition of the form A ≈ CUR, where C is a matrix consisting of a small number of columns of A, R is a matrix consisting of a small number of rows of A, and U is an appropriately-deﬁned low-dimensional matrix. [sent-394, score-0.459]
</p><p>89 The matrices C and R are constructed with carefully-chosen and data-dependent nonuniform probability distributions, and from C and R a matrix U ∈ Rc×r is constructed such that under appropriate assumptions: A −CUR  ξ  ≤ A − Ak  ξ +ε  A  F,  (50)  with high probability, for both ξ = 2, F. [sent-397, score-0.145]
</p><p>90 Although these algorithms apply to any matrix, and thus to a SPSD matrix, the computed approximation CUR (with the provable error bounds of the form (50)) is neither symmetric nor positive semideﬁnite in the latter case. [sent-398, score-0.086]
</p><p>91 The analysis of the M AIN A PPROXIMATION algorithm shows that if G is a SPSD matrix then we can choose R = CT and U = A+ and obtain a SPSD approximation of the 11 ˜ form G ≈ Gk = CWk+CT with provable error bounds of the form (1). [sent-400, score-0.168]
</p><p>92 In addition, to understand the o CUR algorithm in terms of matrix completion, consider an m × n matrix A with c columns and r rows chosen in some manner which is partitioned as in (40). [sent-404, score-0.287]
</p><p>93 Let U ∈ Rc×r be an appropriately deﬁned matrix as in Drineas, Kannan, and Mahoney (2004c), and let us decompose the original matrix A of (40) as A ≈ CUR: CUR = =  A11 A21  U  A11 A12  A11UA11 A11UA12 A21UA11 A21UA12  (51) . [sent-405, score-0.181]
</p><p>94 Thus, the quality of the approximation of the full matrix can not be quantiﬁed simply by the norm of the Schur complement A22 − A21 A+ A12 ξ , and in Drineas, Kannan, and Mahoney (2004c) we 11 2171  D RINEAS AND M AHONEY  bound A −CUR ξ directly. [sent-408, score-0.116]
</p><p>95 , by how well a basis the chosen columns of C are for the remaining columns of A. [sent-411, score-0.164]
</p><p>96 Conclusion We have presented and analyzed an algorithm that provides an approximate decomposition of an ˜ n × n Gram matrix G which is of the form G ≈ Gk = CWk+CT and which has provable error bounds of the form (1). [sent-413, score-0.174]
</p><p>97 2 First, it would be desirable to choose the probabilities in Theorem 3 to be pi = G(i) / G 2 and F to establish bounds of the form (1) in which the scale of the additional error was G F = X T X F rather than ∑n G2 = X 2 . [sent-416, score-0.111]
</p><p>98 This would likely be a corollary of a CUR decomposition for a general m × n matrix A with error bounds of the form (50) in which U = Wk+ , where W is now the matrix consisting of the intersection of the chosen columns and (in general different) rows. [sent-418, score-0.332]

<p>Author: Petros Drineas, Michael W. Mahoney</p><p>Abstract: A problem for many kernel-based methods is that the amount of computation required to ﬁnd the solution scales as O(n3 ), where n is the number of training examples. We develop and analyze an algorithm to compute an easily-interpretable low-rank approximation to an n × n Gram matrix G such that computations of interest may be performed more rapidly. The approximation is of ˜ the form Gk = CWk+CT , where C is a matrix consisting of a small number c of columns of G and Wk is the best rank-k approximation to W , the matrix formed by the intersection between those c columns of G and the corresponding c rows of G. An important aspect of the algorithm is the probability distribution used to randomly sample the columns; we will use a judiciously-chosen and data-dependent nonuniform probability distribution. Let · 2 and · F denote the spectral norm and the Frobenius norm, respectively, of a matrix, and let Gk be the best rank-k approximation to G. We prove that by choosing O(k/ε4 ) columns G −CWk+CT ξ ≤ G − Gk ξ +ε n ∑ G2 , ii i=1 both in expectation and with high probability, for both ξ = 2, F, and for all k : 0 ≤ k ≤ rank(W ). This approximation can be computed using O(n) additional space and time, after making two passes over the data from external storage. The relationships between this algorithm, other related matrix decompositions, and the Nystr¨ m method from integral equation theory are discussed.1 o Keywords: kernel methods, randomized algorithms, Gram matrix, Nystr¨ m method o</p><p>2 0.040618151 <a title="60-tfidf-2" href="./jmlr-2005-Dimension_Reduction_in_Text_Classification_with_Support_Vector_Machines.html">27 jmlr-2005-Dimension Reduction in Text Classification with Support Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Hyunsoo Kim, Peg Howland, Haesun Park</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) have been recognized as one of the most successful classiﬁcation methods for many applications including text classiﬁcation. Even though the learning ability and computational complexity of training in support vector machines may be independent of the dimension of the feature space, reducing computational complexity is an essential issue to efﬁciently handle a large number of terms in practical applications of text classiﬁcation. In this paper, we adopt novel dimension reduction methods to reduce the dimension of the document vectors dramatically. We also introduce decision functions for the centroid-based classiﬁcation algorithm and support vector classiﬁers to handle the classiﬁcation problem where a document may belong to multiple classes. Our substantial experimental results show that with several dimension reduction methods that are designed particularly for clustered data, higher efﬁciency for both training and testing can be achieved without sacriﬁcing prediction accuracy of text classiﬁcation even when the dimension of the input space is signiﬁcantly reduced.

<p>Author: Lior Wolf, Amnon Shashua</p><p>Abstract: The problem of selecting a subset of relevant features in a potentially overwhelming quantity of data is classic and found in many branches of science. Examples in computer vision, text processing and more recently bio-informatics are abundant. In text classiﬁcation tasks, for example, it is not uncommon to have 104 to 107 features of the size of the vocabulary containing word frequency counts, with the expectation that only a small fraction of them are relevant. Typical examples include the automatic sorting of URLs into a web directory and the detection of spam email. In this work we present a deﬁnition of “relevancy” based on spectral properties of the Laplacian of the features’ measurement matrix. The feature selection process is then based on a continuous ranking of the features deﬁned by a least-squares optimization process. A remarkable property of the feature relevance function is that sparse solutions for the ranking values naturally emerge as a result of a “biased non-negativity” of a key matrix in the process. As a result, a simple leastsquares optimization process converges onto a sparse solution, i.e., a selection of a subset of features which form a local maximum over the relevance function. The feature selection algorithm can be embedded in both unsupervised and supervised inference problems and empirical evidence show that the feature selections typically achieve high accuracy even when only a small fraction of the features are relevant.</p><p>4 0.039505728 <a title="60-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2005-Concentration_Bounds_for_Unigram_Language_Models.html">22 jmlr-2005-Concentration Bounds for Unigram Language Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Evgeny Drukh, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We show several high-probability concentration bounds for learning unigram language models. One interesting quantity is the probability of all words appearing exactly k times in a sample of size m. A standard estimator for this quantity is the Good-Turing estimator. The existing analysis on k its error shows a high-probability bound of approximately O √m . We improve its dependency on k to O √ 4 √k m k + m . We also analyze the empirical frequencies estimator, showing that with high probability its error is bounded by approximately O 2 −5 which has an error of approximately O m 1 k + √ k m . We derive a combined estimator, , for any k. A standard measure for the quality of a learning algorithm is its expected per-word log-loss. The leave-one-out method can be used for estimating the log-loss of the unigram model. We show 1 that its error has a high-probability bound of approximately O √m , for any underlying distribution. We also bound the log-loss a priori, as a function of various parameters of the distribution. Keywords: Good-Turing estimators, logarithmic loss, leave-one-out estimation, Chernoff bounds 1. Introduction and Overview Natural language processing (NLP) has developed rapidly over the last decades. It has a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, optical character recognition, text categorization and many more. The theoretical analysis has also advanced signiﬁcantly, though many fundamental questions remain unanswered. One clear challenge, both practical and theoretical, concerns deriving stochastic models for natural languages. Consider a simple language model, where the distribution of each word in the text is assumed to be independent. Even for such a simplistic model, fundamental questions relating sample size to the learning accuracy are already challenging. This is mainly due to the fact that the sample size is almost always insufﬁcient, regardless of how large it is. To demonstrate this phenomena, consider the following example. We would like to estimate the distribution of ﬁrst names in the university. For that, we are given the names list of a graduate seminar: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dan, Eve, Frank, two Georges, and two Henries. How can we use this sample to estimate the distribution of students’ ﬁrst names? An empirical frequency estimator would c 2005 Evgeny Drukh and Yishay Mansour. D RUKH AND M ANSOUR assign Alice the probability of 0.1, since there is one Alice in the list of 10 names, while George, appearing twice, would get estimation of 0.2. Unfortunately, unseen names, such as Michael, will get an estimation of 0. Clearly, in this simple example the empirical frequencies are unlikely to estimate well the desired distribution. In general, the empirical frequencies estimate well the probabilities of popular names, but are rather inaccurate for rare names. Is there a sample size, which assures us that all the names (or most of them) will appear enough times to allow accurate probabilities estimation? The distribution of ﬁrst names can be conjectured to follow the Zipf’s law. In such distributions, there will be a signiﬁcant fraction of rare items, as well as a considerable number of non-appearing items, in any sample of reasonable size. The same holds for the language unigram models, which try to estimate the distribution of single words. As it has been observed empirically on many occasions (Chen, 1996; Curran and Osborne, 2002), there are always many rare words and a considerable number of unseen words, regardless of the sample size. Given this observation, a fundamental issue is to estimate the distribution the best way possible. 1.1 Good-Turing Estimators An important quantity, given a sample, is the probability mass of unseen words (also called “the missing mass”). Several methods exist for smoothing the probability and assigning probability mass to unseen items. The almost standard method for estimating the missing probability mass is the Good-Turing estimator. It estimates the missing mass as the total number of unique items, divided by the sample size. In the names example above, the Good-Turing missing mass estimator is equal 0.6, meaning that the list of the class names does not reﬂect the true distribution, to put it mildly. The Good-Turing estimator can be extended for higher orders, that is, estimating the probability of all names appearing exactly k times. Such estimators can also be used for estimating the probability of individual words. The Good-Turing estimators dates back to World War II, and were published ﬁrst in 1953 (Good, 1953, 2000). It has been extensively used in language modeling applications since then (Katz, 1987; Church and Gale, 1991; Chen, 1996; Chen and Goodman, 1998). However, their theoretical convergence rate in various models has been studied only in the recent years (McAllester and Schapire, 2000, 2001; Kutin, 2002; McAllester and Ortiz, 2003; Orlitsky et al., 2003). For estimation of the probability of all words appearing exactly k times in a sample of size m, McAllester and Schapire k (2000) derive a high probability bound on Good-Turing estimator error of approximately O √m . One of our main results improves the dependency on k of this bound to approximately O √ 4 √k + k m m √ k 1 k+ m , We also show that the empirical frequencies estimator has an error of approximately O for large values of k. Based on the two estimators, we derive a combined estimator with an error of √ 4 2 k approximately O m− 5 , for any k. We also derive a weak lower bound of Ω √m for an error of any estimator based on an independent sample. Our results give theoretical justiﬁcation for using the Good-Turing estimator for small values of k, and the empirical frequencies estimator for large values of k. Though in most applications the Good-Turing estimator is used for very small values of k, for example k ≤ 5, as by Katz (1987) or Chen (1996), we show that it is fairly accurate in a much wider range. 1232 . C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS 1.2 Logarithmic Loss The Good-Turing estimators are used to approximate the probability mass of all the words with a certain frequency. For many applications, estimating this probability mass is not the main optimization criteria. Instead, a certain distance measure between the true and the estimated distributions needs to be minimized. The most popular distance measure used in NLP applications is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. For a true distribution P = {px }, and an estimated distribution Q = {qx }, both over some px set X, this measure is deﬁned as ∑x px ln qx . An equivalent measure, up to the entropy of P, is the 1 logarithmic loss (log-loss), which equals ∑x px ln qx . Many NLP applications use the value of log-loss to evaluate the quality of the estimated distribution. However, the log-loss cannot be directly calculated, since it depends on the underlying distribution, which is unknown. Therefore, estimating log-loss using the sample is important, although the sample cannot be independently used for both estimating the distribution and testing it. The hold-out estimation splits the sample into two parts: training and testing. The training part is used for learning the distribution, whereas the testing sample is used for evaluating the average per-word log-loss. The main disadvantage of this method is the fact that it uses only part of the available information for learning, whereas in practice one would like to use all the sample. A widely used general estimation method is called leave-one-out. Basically, it performs averaging all the possible estimations, where a single item is chosen for testing, and the rest are used for training. This procedure has an advantage of using the entire sample, and in addition it is rather simple and usually can be easily implemented. The existing theoretical analysis of the leave-oneout method (Holden, 1996; Kearns and Ron, 1999) shows general high probability concentration bounds for the generalization error. However, these techniques are not applicable in our setting. 1 We show that the leave-one-out estimation error for the log-loss is approximately O √m , for any underlying distribution and a general family of learning algorithms. It gives a theoretical justiﬁcation for effective use of leave-one-out estimation for the log-loss. We also analyze the concentration of the log-loss itself, not based of an empirical measure. We address the characteristics of the underlying distribution affecting the log-loss. We ﬁnd such a characteristic, deﬁning a tight bound for the log-loss value. 1.3 Model and Semantics We denote the set of all words as V , and N = |V |. Let P be a distribution over V , where pw is the probability of a word w ∈ V . Given a sample S of size m, drawn i.i.d. using P, we denote the number of appearances of a word w in S as cS , or simply cw , when a sample S is clear from the context.1 We w deﬁne Sk = {w ∈ V : cS = k}, and nk = |Sk |. w For a claim Φ regarding a sample S, we write ∀δ S Φ[S] for P(Φ[S]) ≥ 1 − δ. For some error c ˜ bound function f (·), which holds with probability 1 − δ, we write O( f (·)) for O f (·) ln m , δ where c > 0 is some constant. 1.4 Paper Organization Section 2 shows several standard concentration inequalities, together with their technical applications regarding the maximum-likelihood approximation. Section 3 shows the error bounds for the 1. Unless mentioned otherwise, all further sample-dependent deﬁnitions depend on the sample S. 1233 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR k-hitting mass estimation. Section 4 bounds the error for the leave-one-out estimation of the logarithmic loss. Section 5 shows the bounds for the a priori logarithmic loss. Appendix A includes the technical proofs. 2. Concentration Inequalities In this section we state several standard Chernoff-style concentration inequalities. We also show some of their corollaries regarding the maximum-likelihood approximation of pw by pw = cw . ˆ m Lemma 1 (Hoeffding, 1963) Let Y = Y1 , . . . ,Yn be a set of n independent random variables, such that Yi ∈ [bi , bi + di ]. Then, for any ε > 0, P ∑ Yi − E ∑ Yi i >ε i ≤ 2 exp − 2ε2 ∑i di2 . The next lemma is a variant of an extension of Hoeffding’s inequality, by McDiarmid (1989). Lemma 2 Let Y = Y1 , . . . ,Yn be a set of n independent random variables, and f (Y ) such that any change of Yi value changes f (Y ) by at most di , that is sup ∀ j=i,Y j =Y j (| f (Y ) − f (Y )|) ≤ di . Let d = maxi di . Then, ∀δY : | f (Y ) − E[ f (Y )]| ≤ d n ln 2 δ . 2 Lemma 3 (Angluin and Valiant, 1979) Let Y = Y1 , . . . ,Yn be a set of n independent random variables, where Yi ∈ [0, B]. Let µ = E [∑i Yi ]. Then, for any ε > 0, P ∑ Yi < µ − ε ≤ exp − ε2 , 2µB ∑ Yi > µ + ε ≤ exp − ε2 . (2µ + ε)B i P i Deﬁnition 4 (Dubhashi and Ranjan, 1998) A set of random variables Y1 , . . . ,Yn is called “negatively associated”, if it satisﬁes for any two disjoint subsets I and J of {1, . . . , n}, and any two non-decreasing, or any two non-increasing, functions f from R|I| to R and g from R|J| to R: E[ f (Yi : i ∈ I)g(Y j : j ∈ J)] ≤ E[ f (Yi : i ∈ I)]E[g(Y j : j ∈ J)]. The next lemma is based on the negative association analysis. It follows directly from Theorem 14 and Proposition 7 of Dubhashi and Ranjan (1998). 1234 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS Lemma 5 For any set of N non-decreasing, or N non-increasing functions { fw : w ∈ V }, any Chernoff-style bound on ∑w∈V fw (cw ), pretending that cw are independent, is valid. In particular, Lemmas 1 and 2 apply for {Y1 , ...,Yn } = { fw (cw ) : w ∈ V }. The next lemma shows an explicit upper bound on the binomial distribution probability.2 Lemma 6 Let X ∼ Bin(n, p) be a sum of n i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with p ∈ (0, 1). Let 1 µ = E[X] = np. For x ∈ (0, n], there exists some function Tx = exp 12x + O x12 , such that ∀k ∈ Tn 1 {0, . . . , n}, we have P(X = k) ≤ √ Tµ Tn−µ . For integral values of µ, the equality is achieved 2πµ(1−p) at k = µ. (Note that for x ≥ 1, we have Tx = Θ(1).) The next lemma deals with the number of successes in independent trials. Lemma 7 (Hoeffding, 1956) Let Y1 , . . . ,Yn ∈ {0, 1} be a sequence of independent trials, with pi = 1 E[Yi ]. Let X = ∑i Yi be the number of successes, and p = n ∑i pi be the average trial success probability. For any integers b and c such that 0 ≤ b ≤ np ≤ c ≤ n, we have c ∑ k=b n k p (1 − p)n−k ≤ P (b ≤ X ≤ c) ≤ 1. k Using the above lemma, the next lemma shows a general concentration bound for a sum of arbitrary real-valued functions of a multinomial distribution components. We show that with a small penalty, any Chernoff-style bound pretending the components being independent is valid.3 We recall that cS , or equivalently cw , is the number of appearances of the word w in a sample S of w size m. Lemma 8 Let {cw ∼ Bin(m, pw ) : w ∈ V } be independent binomial random variables. Let { fw (x) : w ∈ V } be a set of real valued functions. Let F = ∑w fw (cw ) and F = ∑w fw (cw ). For any ε > 0, √ P (|F − E [F]| > ε) ≤ 3 m P F − E F >ε . The following lemmas provide concentration bounds for maximum-likelihood estimation of pw by pw = cw . The ﬁrst lemma shows that words with “high” probability have a “high” count in the ˆ m sample. Lemma 9 Let δ > 0, and λ ≥ 3. We have ∀δ S: ∀w ∈ V, s.t. mpw ≥ 3 ln 2m , δ |mpw − cw | ≤ ∀w ∈ V, s.t. mpw > λ ln 2m , δ cw > 1− 3mpw ln 3 λ 2m ; δ mpw . 2. Its proof is based on Stirling approximation directly, though local limit theorems could be used. This form of bound is needed for the proof of Theorem 30. 3. The negative association analysis (Lemma 5) shows that a sum of monotone functions of multinomial distribution components must obey Chernoff-style bounds pretending that the components are independent. In some sense, our result extends this notion, since it does not require the functions to be monotone. 1235 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR The second lemma shows that words with “low” probability have a “low” count in the sample. Lemma 10 Let δ ∈ (0, 1), and m > 1. Then, ∀δ S: ∀w ∈ V such that mpw ≤ 3 ln m , we have cw ≤ δ 6 ln m . δ The following lemma derives the bound as a function of the count in the sample (and not as a function of the unknown probability). Lemma 11 Let δ > 0. Then, ∀δ S: cw > 18 ln 4m , δ ∀w ∈ V, s.t. |mpw − cw | ≤ 6cw ln 4m . δ The following is a general concentration bound. Lemma 12 For any δ > 0, and any word w ∈ V , we have ∀δ S, cw − pw < m 3 ln 2 δ . m The following lemma bounds the probability of words that do not appear in the sample. Lemma 13 Let δ > 0. Then, ∀δ S: ∀w ∈ S, / mpw < ln m . δ 3. K-Hitting Mass Estimation In this section our goal is to estimate the probability of the set of words appearing exactly k times in the sample, which we call “the k-hitting mass”. We analyze the Good-Turing estimator, the empirical frequencies estimator, and a combined estimator. ˆ Deﬁnition 14 We deﬁne the k-hitting mass Mk , its empirical frequencies estimator Mk , and its 4 Good-Turing estimator Gk as Mk = ∑ w∈Sk pw ˆ Mk = k nk m Gk = k+1 nk+1 . m−k The outline of this section is as follows. Deﬁnition 16 slightly redeﬁnes the k-hitting mass and its estimators. Lemma 17 shows that this redeﬁnition has a negligible inﬂuence. Then, we analyze the estimation errors using the concentration inequalities from Section 2. Lemmas 20 and 21 bound the expectation of the Good-Turing estimator error, following McAllester and Schapire (2000). Lemma 23 bounds the deviation of the error, using the negative association analysis. A tighter bound, based on Lemma 8, is achieved at Theorem 25. Theorem 26 analyzes the error of the empirical frequencies estimator. Theorem 29 refers to the combined estimator. Finally, Theorem 30 shows a weak lower bound for the k-hitting mass estimation. 4. The Good-Turing estimator is usually deﬁned as ( k+1 )nk+1 . The two deﬁnitions are almost identical for small values m k of k, as their quotient equals 1 − m . Following McAllester and Schapire (2000), our deﬁnition makes the calculations slightly simpler. 1236 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS Deﬁnition 15 For any w ∈ V and i ∈ {0, · · · , m}, we deﬁne Xw,i as a random variable equal 1 if cw = i, and 0 otherwise. The following deﬁnition concentrates on words whose frequencies are close to their probabilities. Deﬁnition 16 Let α > 0 and k > 3α2 . We deﬁne Ik,α = pw ∈ Ik,α }. We deﬁne: Mk,α = ∑ pw = w∈Sk ∩Vk,α ∑ √ √ k−α k k+1+α k+1 m , m , and Vk,α = {w ∈ V : pw Xw,k , w∈Vk,α Gk,α = k+1 k+1 |Sk+1 ∩Vk,α | = ∑ Xw,k+1 , m−k m − k w∈Vk,α ˆ Mk,α = k k |Sk ∩Vk,α | = ∑ Xw,k . m m w∈Vk,α By Lemma 11, for large values of k the redeﬁnition coincides with the original deﬁnition with high probability: Lemma 17 For δ > 0, let α = ˆ ˆ and Mk = Mk,α . 6 ln 4m . For k > 18 ln 4m , we have ∀δ S: Mk = Mk,α , Gk = Gk,α , δ δ Proof By Lemma 11, we have ∀δ S, ∀w : cw > 18 ln 4m , δ |mpw − cw | ≤ 6cw ln √ 4m = α cw . δ This means that any word w with cw = k has √ √ √ k−α k k+α k k+1+α k+1 ≤ pw ≤ < . m m m √ ˆ Therefore w ∈ Vk,α , completing the proof for Mk and Mk . Since α < k, any word w with cw = k + 1 has √ √ √ k−α k k+1−α k+1 k+1+α k+1 < ≤ pw ≤ , m m m which yields w ∈ Vk,α , completing the proof for Gk . Since the minimal probability of a word in Vk,α is Ω Lemma 18 Let α > 0 and k > 3α2 . Then, |Vk,α | = O 1237 m k k m . , we derive: D RUKH AND M ANSOUR Proof We have α < √ √k . 3 Any word w ∈ Vk,α has pw ≥ |Vk,α | < √ k−α k m > k m 1 1 − √3 . Therefore, m m 1 , =O 1 k 1− √ k 3 which completes the proof. Using Lemma 6, we derive: Lemma 19 Let α > 0 and 3α2 < k ≤ m . Let w ∈ Vk,α . Then, E[Xw,k ] = P(cw = k) = O 2 1 √ k . Proof Since cw ∼ Bin(m, pw ) is a binomial random variable, we use Lemma 6: E[Xw,k ] = P(cw = k) ≤ Tm 1 . 2πmpw (1 − pw ) Tmpw Tm(1−pw ) For w ∈ Vk,α , we have mpw = Ω(k), which implies 3α2 < k ≤ m 2, Tm Tmpw Tm(1−pw ) we have 1 2πmpw (1 − pw ) ≤ = O(1). Since pw ∈ Ik,α and 1 √ 2π k − α k √ k+1+α k+1 m 1− 1 < 1 2πk 1 − √3 1 1 − k+1 1 + √3 m 1 < 1 2πk 1 − √3 1− 1 2 1 +m 1 1 + √3 1 = O √ , k which completes the proof. 3.1 Good-Turing Estimator The following lemma, directly based on the deﬁnition of the binomial distribution, was shown in Theorem 1 of McAllester and Schapire (2000).

Leave-One-Out Estimation of Log-Loss Many NLP applications use log-loss as the learning performance criteria. Since the log-loss depends on the underlying probability P, its value cannot be explicitly calculated, and must be approximated. The main result of this section, Theorem 32, is an upper bound on the leave-one-out estimation of the log-loss, assuming a general family of learning algorithms. Given a sample S = {s1 , . . . , sm }, the goal of a learning algorithm is to approximate the true probability P by some probability Q. We denote the probability assigned by the learning algorithm to a word w by qw . Deﬁnition 31 We assume that any two words with equal sample frequency are assigned equal probabilities in Q, and therefore denote qw by q(cw ). Let the log-loss of a distribution Q be L = 1 1 ∑ pw ln qw = ∑ Mk ln q(k) . w∈V k≥0 Let the leave-one-out estimation, qw , be the probability assigned to w, when one of its instances is removed. We assume that any two words with equal sample frequency are assigned equal leaveone-out probability estimation, and therefore denote qw by q (cw ). We deﬁne the leave-one-out estimation of the log-loss as averaging the loss of each sample word, when it is extracted from the sample and pretended to be the test sample: 1243 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR ∑ Lleave−one = w∈V cw knk 1 1 =∑ ln ln . m qw k>0 m q (k) 1 1 Let Lw = L(cw ) = ln q(cw ) , and Lw = L (cw ) = ln q (cw ) . Let the maximal loss be Lmax = max max L(k), L (k + 1) . k In this section we discuss a family of learning algorithms, that receive the sample as an input. Assuming an accuracy parameter δ, we require the following properties to hold: 1. Starting from a certain number of appearances, the estimation is close to the sample frequency. Speciﬁcally, for some α, β ∈ [0, 1], ∀k ≥ ln 4m , δ q(k) = k−α . m−β (10) 2. The algorithm is stable when a single word is extracted from the sample: ∀m, 1 , m 1 L (k + 1) − L(k) = O S . n1 2 ≤ k ≤ 10 ln 4m , δ L (k + 1) − L(k) = O ∀m, ∀S s.t. nS > 0, k ∈ {0, 1}, 1 (11) (12) An example of such an algorithm is the following leave-one-out algorithm (we assume that the vocabulary is large enough so that n0 + n1 > 0): qw = N−n0 −1 (n0 +n1 )(m−1) cw −1 m−1 cw ≤ 1 cw ≥ 2. Equation (10) is satisﬁed by α = β = 1. Equation (11) is satisﬁed for k ≥ 2 by L(k) − L (k + 1) = 1 = O m . Equation (12) is satisﬁed for k ≤ 1: ln m−1 m−2 N − n0 − 1 m − 2 N − n0 − 2 m − 1 n0 + n1 + 1 m − 2 |L (2) − L(1)| = ln n0 + n1 m − 1 |L (1) − L(0)| = ln 1 1 1 =O + , N − n0 m n1 1 1 1 =O + . =O n0 + n1 m n1 =O The following is the main theorem of this section. It bounds the deviation between the between the true loss and the leave one out estimate. This bound shows that for a general family of learning algorithms, leave-one-out technique can be effectively used to estimate the logarithmic loss, given the sample only. The estimation error bound decreases roughly in proportion to the square root of the sample size, regardless of the underlying distribution. 1244 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS Theorem 32 For a learning algorithm satisfying Equations (10), (11), and (12), and δ > 0, we have: δ ∀ S, |L − Lleave−one | = O Lmax (ln m )4 ln δ m ln m δ δ . The proof of Theorem 32 bounds the estimation error separately for the high-probability and low-probability words. We use Lemma 20 (McAllester and Schapire, 2000) to bound the estimation error for low-probability words. The expected estimation error for the high-probability words is bounded elementarily using the deﬁnition of the binomial distribution (Lemma 33). Finally, we use McDiarmid’s inequality (Lemma 2) to bound its deviation. The next lemma shows that the expectation of the leave-one-out method is a good approximation for the per-word expectation of the logarithmic loss. Lemma 33 Let 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, and y ≥ 1. Let Bn ∼ Bin(n, p) be a binomial random variable. Let fy (x) = ln(max(x, y)). Then, 0 ≤ E p fy (Bn − α) − 3p Bn fy (Bn − α − 1) ≤ . n n Proof For a real valued function F (here F(x) = fy (x − α)), we have: E Bn F(Bn − 1) n n = ∑ x=0 n = p∑ x=1 n x x p (1 − p)n−x F(x − 1) x n n − 1 x−1 p (1 − p)(n−1)−(x−1) F(x − 1) x−1 = pE[F(Bn−1 )] , where we used n x x n = E p fy (Bn − α) − n−1 x−1 . Since Bn ∼ Bn−1 + B1 , we have: Bn fy (Bn − α − 1) n = p(E[ fy (Bn−1 + B1 − α)] − E[ fy (Bn−1 − α)]) max(Bn−1 + B1 − α, y) max(Bn−1 − α, y) max(Bn−1 − α + B1 , y + B1 ) ≤ pE ln max(Bn−1 − α, y) B1 = pE ln(1 + ) max(Bn−1 − α, y) B1 ≤ pE . max(Bn−1 − α, y) = pE ln Since B1 and Bn−1 are independent, we get 1245 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR pE B1 1 = pE[B1 ]E max(Bn−1 − α, y) max(Bn−1 − α, y) 1 = p2 E max(Bn−1 − α, y) n−1 = p2 ∑ n−1 x 1 p (1 − p)n−1−x x max(x − α, y) = p2 ∑ x+1 1 n−1 x p (1 − p)n−1−x x + 1 max(x − α, y) x x=0 n−1 x=0 ≤ ≤ n−1 p x+1 n max px+1 (1 − p)n−(x+1) ∑ n x max(x − α, y) x=0 x + 1 3p 3p (1 − (1 − p)n ) < .

It shows that the log-loss can be effectively estimated, for a general family of learning algorithms. Another question to be considered is the log-loss distribution itself, without the empirical estimation. That is, how large (or low) is it expected to be, and which parameters of the distribution affect it. We denote the learning error (equivalent to the log-loss) as the KL-divergence between the true and the estimated distribution. We refer to a general family of learning algorithms, and show lower and upper bounds for the learning error. The upper bound (Theorem 39) can be divided to three parts. The ﬁrst part is the missing mass. The other two build a trade-off between a threshold (lower thresholds leads to a lower bound), and the number of words with probability exceeding this threshold (fewer words lead to a lower bound). It seems that this number of words is a necessary lower bound, as we show at Theorem 35. 1 Theorem 35 Let the distribution be uniform: ∀w ∈ V : pw = N , with N m. Also, suppose that the learning algorithm just uses maximum-likelihood approximation, meaning qw = cw . Then, a typical m learning error would be Ω( N ). m The proof of Theorem 35 bases on the Pinsker inequality (Lemma 36). It ﬁrst shows a lower bound for L1 norm between the true and the expected distributions, and then transforms it to the form of the learning error. Lemma 36 (Pinsker Inequality) Given any two distributions P and Q, we have 1 KL(P||Q) ≥ (L1 (P, Q))2 . 2 Theorem 35 Proof We ﬁrst show that L1 (P, Q) concentrates near Ω N m . Then, we use Pinsker inequality to show lower bound5 of KL(P||Q). First we ﬁnd a lower bound for E[|pw − qw |]. Since cw is a binomial random variable, σ2 [cw ] = m mpw (1 − pw ) = Ω N , and with some constant probability, |cw − mpw | > σ[cw ]. Therefore, we have E[|qw − pw |] = ≥ E 1 E[|cw − mpw |] m 1 1 σ[cw ]P(|cw − mpw | > σ[cw ]) = Ω m m ∑ |pw − qw | w∈V = Ω N√ 1 mN =Ω 1 =Ω √ mN m N N m . 5. This proof does not optimize the constants. Asymptotic analysis of logarithmic transform of binomial variables by Flajolet (1999) can be used to achieve explicit values for KL(P||Q). 1250 C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS 2 A single change in the sample changes L1 (P, Q) by at most m . Using McDiarmid inequality 1 (Lemma 2) on L1 (P, Q) as a function of sample words, we have ∀ 2 S: L1 (P, Q) ≥ E[L1 (P, Q)] − |L1 (P, Q) − E[L1 (P, Q)]| √ N m N −O =Ω . = Ω m m m Using Pinsker inequality (Lemma 36), we have 1 2 ∀ S, pw 1 ∑ pw ln qw ≥ 2 w∈V 2 ∑ |pw − qw | =Ω w∈V N , m which completes the proof. Deﬁnition 37 Let α ∈ (0, 1) and τ ≥ 1. We deﬁne an (absolute discounting) algorithm Aα,τ , which α “removes” m probability mass from words appearing at most τ times, and uniformly spreads it among the unseen words. We denote by n1...τ = ∑τ ni the number of words with count between 1 i=1 and τ.

We can rewrite this bound roughly as Nλ λ ˜ ≤ O M0 + √ + m m m pw qw ∑ pw ln w∈V . This bound implies the characteristics of the distribution inﬂuencing the log-loss. It shows that a “good” distribution can involve many low-probability words, given that the missing mass is low. However, the learning error would increase if the dictionary included many mid-range3 probability words. For example, if a typical word’s probability were m− 4 , the bound would become 1 ˜ O M0 + m− 4 . Lemma 40 For any δ > 0, the learning error for non-appearing words can be bounded with high probability by ∑ ∀δ S, pw ln w∈S / pw qw ≤ M0 ln n0 ln m δ αn1...τ .

Lemma 8 Proof Let m = ∑w∈V cw . Using Lemma 7 for m with b = c = E[m ] = m, the prob1 ability P(m = m) achieves its minimum when ∀w ∈ V, pw = N . Under this assumption, we have 1 m ∼ Bin(mN, N ).

Tm TmN−m 3 m Therefore, for any distribution {pw : w ∈ V }, we have 1 P(m = m) ≥ √ . 3 m Obviously, E[F ] = ∑w E[ fw (cw )] = E[F]. Also, the distribution of {cw } given that m = m is identical to the distribution of {cw }, therefore the distribution of F given that m = m is identical to the distribution of F. We have P(|F − E[F ]| > ε) = ∑ P(m i = i)P(|F − E[F ]| > ε|m = i) ≥ P(m = m)P(|F − E[F ]| > ε|m = m) = P(m = m)P(|F − E[F]| > ε) 1 √ P(|F − E[F]| > ε), ≥ 3 m which completes the proof.

Note that for 3 ln 2 ≤ δ δ  3pw ln 2 δ = P (|mpw − cw | ≥ ε) m ≤ 2 exp − ε2 2E[cw ] + ε ≤ 2 exp − 3mpw ln 2 δ 3mpw which completes the proof. 1256 = δ, C ONCENTRATION B OUNDS FOR U NIGRAM L ANGUAGE M ODELS 3 ln 2m Lemma 9 Proof There are at most m words with probability pw ≥ m δ . The ﬁrst claim follows δ using Lemma 44 together with union bound over all these words (with accuracy m for each word). Using the ﬁrst claim, we derive the second. We show a lower bound for 3pw ln 2m δ > pw − pw m cw ≥ pw − m 3 = λ 1− 3 λ cw m, using ln 2m δ m 1 < λ pw : pw . The ﬁnal inequality follows from simple algebra. Lemma 10 Proof Let b = 3 ln( m ). Note that δ ∈ [0, 1] and m > 1 yield b > 2. First, suppose that δ b there are up to m words with pw ≤ m . For each such word, we apply Lemma 3 on cw , with ε = b. We have: P cw > 6 ln m b2 ≤ P (cw > mpw + ε) ≤ exp − δ 2mpw + b ≤ δ . m Since we assume that there are up to m such words, the total mistake probability is δ. Now we assume the general case, that is, without any assumption on the number of words. Our goal is to reduce the problem to the former conditions, that is, to create a set of size m of words with b probability smaller than m . We ﬁrst create m empty sets v1 , . . . , vm . Let the probability of each set vi , pvi , be the sum of the probabilities of all the words it includes. Let the actual count of vi , cvi , be the sum of the sample counts of all the words w it includes. We divide all the words w between these sets in a bin-packing-approximation manner. We sort the words w in decreasing probability order. Then, we do the following loop: insert the next word w to the set vi with the currently smallest pvi . b We claim that pvi ≤ m for each vi at the end of the loop. If this inequality does not hold, then b some word w made this “overﬂow” ﬁrst. Obviously, pw must be smaller than 2m , otherwise it would b be one of the ﬁrst 2m < m words ordered, and would enter an empty set. If pw < 2m and it made b b an “overﬂow”, then the probability of each set at the moment w was entered must exceed 2m , since w must have entered the lightest set available. This means that the total probability of all words b entered by that moment was greater than m 2m > 1. Applying the case of m words to the sets v1 , . . . , vm , we have ∀δ S: for every vi , cvi ≤ 2b. Also, if the count of each set vi does not exceed 2b, so does the count of each word w ∈ vi . That is, P ∃w : pw ≤ b b , cw > 2b ≤ P ∃vi : pvi ≤ , cvi > 2b ≤ δ, m m which completes the proof. 1257 D RUKH AND M ANSOUR δ Lemma 11 Proof By Lemma 9 with some λ > 3 (which will be set later), we have ∀ 2 S: 3 ln 4m δ , m λ ln 4m δ ∀w : pw > , m ∀w : pw ≥ By Equation (35), for any word w such that √ λ + 3λ ln 4m .

This means that for δ δ √ 4m 4m any w such that cw > λ + 3λ ln δ , we have mpw > λ ln δ . By Equation (36), this means δ ∀ 2 S, ∀w s.t. pw ≤ mpw ≤ 1− 3 ln 4m δ m , cw ≤ 6 ln 1 √ 3 cw , and by Equation (35): λ |mpw − cw | ≤ 4m 3mpw ln ≤ δ 3cw ln 4m δ 1− 3 λ = √ 3cw λ ln 4m √ √δ . λ− 3 Substituting λ = 12 results in ∀δ S : ∀w s.t. cw > 18 ln 4m , δ |mpw − cw | ≤ 6cw ln 4m , δ which completes the proof.

<p>Author: Joaquin Quiñonero-Candela, Carl Edward Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We provide a new unifying view, including all existing proper probabilistic sparse approximations for Gaussian process regression. Our approach relies on expressing the effective prior which the methods are using. This allows new insights to be gained, and highlights the relationship between existing methods. It also allows for a clear theoretically justiﬁed ranking of the closeness of the known approximations to the corresponding full GPs. Finally we point directly to designs of new better sparse approximations, combining the best of the existing strategies, within attractive computational constraints. Keywords: Gaussian process, probabilistic regression, sparse approximation, Bayesian committee machine Regression models based on Gaussian processes (GPs) are simple to implement, ﬂexible, fully probabilistic models, and thus a powerful tool in many areas of application. Their main limitation is that memory requirements and computational demands grow as the square and cube respectively, of the number of training cases n, effectively limiting a direct implementation to problems with at most a few thousand cases. To overcome the computational limitations numerous authors have recently suggested a wealth of sparse approximations. Common to all these approximation schemes is that only a subset of the latent variables are treated exactly, and the remaining variables are given some approximate, but computationally cheaper treatment. However, the published algorithms have widely different motivations, emphasis and exposition, so it is difﬁcult to get an overview (see Rasmussen and Williams, 2006, chapter 8) of how they relate to each other, and which can be expected to give rise to the best algorithms. In this paper we provide a unifying view of sparse approximations for GP regression. Our approach is simple, but powerful: for each algorithm we analyze the posterior, and compute the effective prior which it is using. Thus, we reinterpret the algorithms as “exact inference with an approximated prior”, rather than the existing (ubiquitous) interpretation “approximate inference with the exact prior”. This approach has the advantage of directly expressing the approximations in terms of prior assumptions about the function, which makes the consequences of the approximations much easier to understand. While our view of the approximations is not the only one possible, it has the advantage of putting all existing probabilistic sparse approximations under one umbrella, thus enabling direct comparison and revealing the relation between them. In Section 1 we brieﬂy introduce GP models for regression. In Section 2 we present our unifying framework and write out the key equations in preparation for the unifying analysis of sparse c 2005 Joaquin Qui˜ onero-Candela and Carl Edward Rasmussen. n ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN algorithms in Sections 4-7.

The choice of these variables is itself a challenging problem, and is discussed in Section 9. We comment on a few special approximations outside our general scheme in Section 10 and conclusions are drawn at the end. 1. Gaussian Processes for Regression Probabilistic regression is usually formulated as follows: given a training set D = {(xi , yi ), i = 1, . . . , n} of n pairs of (vectorial) inputs xi and noisy (real, scalar) outputs yi , compute the predictive distribution of the function values f∗ (or noisy y∗ ) at test locations x∗ . In the simplest case (which we deal with here) we assume that the noise is additive, independent and Gaussian, such that the relationship between the (latent) function f (x) and the observed noisy targets y are given by yi = f (xi ) + εi , where εi ∼ N (0, σ2 ) , noise (1) where σ2 is the variance of the noise. noise Deﬁnition 1 A Gaussian process (GP) is a collection of random variables, any ﬁnite number of which have consistent1 joint Gaussian distributions. Gaussian process (GP) regression is a Bayesian approach which assumes a GP prior2 over functions, i.e. assumes a priori that function values behave according to p(f|x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = N (0, K) , (2) where f = [ f1 , f2 , . . . , fn ] is a vector of latent function values, fi = f (xi ) and K is a covariance matrix, whose entries are given by the covariance function, Ki j = k(xi , x j ). Note that the GP treats the latent function values fi as random variables, indexed by the corresponding input. In the following, for simplicity we will always neglect the explicit conditioning on the inputs; the GP model and all expressions are always conditional on the corresponding inputs. The GP model is concerned only with the conditional of the outputs given the inputs; we do not model anything about the inputs themselves. Remark 2 Note, that to adhere to a strict Bayesian formalism, the GP covariance function,3 which deﬁnes the prior, should not depend on the data (although it can depend on additional parameters). As we will see in later sections, some approximations are strictly equivalent to GPs, while others are not. That is, the implied prior may still be multivariate Gaussian, but the covariance function may be different for training and test cases. Deﬁnition 3 A Gaussian process is called degenerate iff the covariance function has a ﬁnite number of non-zero eigenvalues. 1. By consistency is meant simply that the random variables obey the usual rules of marginalization, etc. 2. For notational simplicity we exclusively use zero-mean priors. 3. The covariance function itself shouldn’t depend on the data, though its value at a speciﬁc pair of inputs of course will. 1940 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION Degenerate GPs (such as e.g. with polynomial covariance function) correspond to ﬁnite linear (-in-the-parameters) models, whereas non-degenerate GPs (such as e.g. with squared exponential or RBF covariance function) do not. The prior for a ﬁnite m dimensional linear model only considers a universe of at most m linearly independent functions; this may often be too restrictive when n m. Note however, that non-degeneracy on its own doesn’t guarantee the existence of the “right kind” of ﬂexibility for a given particular modelling task. For a more detailed background on GP models, see for example that of Rasmussen and Williams (2006). Inference in the GP model is simple: we put a joint GP prior on training and test latent values, f and f∗ 4 , and combine it with the likelihood5 p(y|f) using Bayes rule, to obtain the joint posterior p(f, f∗ )p(y|f) . p(y) p(f, f∗ |y) = (3) The ﬁnal step needed to produce the desired posterior predictive distribution is to marginalize out the unwanted training set latent variables: p(f∗ |y) = Z 1 p(y) p(f, f∗ |y)df = Z p(y|f) p(f, f∗ ) df , (4) or in words: the predictive distribution is the marginal of the renormalized joint prior times the likelihood. The joint GP prior and the independent likelihood are both Gaussian p(f, f∗ ) = N 0, Kf,f K∗,f Kf,∗ K∗,∗ , and p(y|f) = N (f, σ2 I) , noise (5) where K is subscript by the variables between which the covariance is computed (and we use the asterisk ∗ as shorthand for f∗ ) and I is the identity matrix. Since both factors in the integral are Gaussian, the integral can be evaluated in closed form to give the Gaussian predictive distribution p(f∗ |y) = N K∗,f (Kf,f + σ2 I)−1 y, K∗,∗ − K∗,f (Kf,f + σ2 I)−1 Kf,∗ , noise noise (6) see the relevant Gaussian identity in appendix A. The problem with the above expression is that it requires inversion of a matrix of size n × n which requires O (n3 ) operations, where n is the number of training cases. Thus, the simple exact implementation can handle problems with at most a few thousand training cases. 2. A New Unifying View We now seek to modify the joint prior p(f∗ , f) from (5) in ways which will reduce the computational requirements from (6). Let us ﬁrst rewrite that prior by introducing an additional set of m latent variables u = [u1 , . . . , um ] , which we call the inducing variables. These latent variables are values of the Gaussian process (as also f and f∗ ), corresponding to a set of input locations Xu , which we call the inducing inputs. Whereas the additional latent variables u are always marginalized out in the predictive distribution, the choice of inducing inputs does leave an imprint on the ﬁnal solution. 4. We will mostly consider a vector of test cases f∗ (rather than a single f∗ ). 5. You may have been expecting the likelihood written as p(y|f∗ , f) but since the likelihood is conditionally independent of everything else given f, this makes no difference. 1941 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN The inducing variables will turn out to be generalizations of variables which other authors have referred to variously as “support points”, “active set” or “pseudo-inputs”. Particular sparse algorithms choose the inducing variables in various different ways; some algorithms chose the inducing inputs to be a subset of the training set, others not, as we will discuss in Section 9. For now consider any arbitrary inducing variables. Due to the consistency of Gaussian processes, we know that we can recover p(f∗ , f) by simply integrating (marginalizing) out u from the joint GP prior p(f∗ , f, u) p(f∗ , f) = Z p(f∗ , f, u) du = Z p(f∗ , f|u) p(u) du, where p(u) = N (0, Ku,u ) . (7) This is an exact expression. Now, we introduce the fundamental approximation which gives rise to almost all sparse approximations. We approximate the joint prior by assuming that f∗ and f are conditionally independent given u, see Figure 1, such that p(f∗ , f) q(f∗ , f) = Z q(f∗ |u) q(f|u) p(u) du . (8) The name inducing variable is motivated by the fact that f and f∗ can only communicate though u, and u therefore induces the dependencies between training and test cases. As we shall detail in the following sections, the different computationally efﬁcient algorithms proposed in the literature correspond to different additional assumptions about the two approximate inducing conditionals q(f|u), q(f∗ |u) of the integral in (8). It will be useful for future reference to specify here the exact expressions for the two conditionals training conditional: test conditional: −1 p(f|u) = N (Kf,u Ku,u u, Kf,f − Qf,f ) , −1 p(f∗ |u) = N (K∗,u Ku,u u, K∗,∗ − Q∗,∗ ) , (9a) (9b) −1 where we have introduced the shorthand notation6 Qa,b Ka,u Ku,u Ku,b . We can readily identify the expressions in (9) as special (noise free) cases of the standard predictive equation (6) with u playing the role of (noise free) observations. Note that the (positive semi-deﬁnite) covariance matrices in (9) have the form K − Q with the following interpretation: the prior covariance K minus a (non-negative deﬁnite) matrix Q quantifying how much information u provides about the variables in question (f or f∗ ). We emphasize that all the sparse methods discussed in the paper correspond simply to different approximations to the conditionals in (9), and throughout we use the exact likelihood and inducing prior p(y|f) = N (f, σ2 I) , and p(u) = N (0, Ku,u ) . (10) noise 3. The Subset of Data (SoD) Approximation Before we get started with the more sophisticated approximations, we mention as a baseline method the simplest possible sparse approximation (which doesn’t fall inside our general scheme): use only a subset of the data (SoD). The computational complexity is reduced to O (m3 ), where m < n. We would not generally expect SoD to be a competitive method, since it would seem impossible (even with fairly redundant data and a good choice of the subset) to get a realistic picture of the 6. Note, that Qa,b depends on u although this is not explicit in the notation. 1942 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION u u    e ¡   ¡ e  e    ¡  e   ¡  e   ¡   e ¡   r r r r r fn f1 f2 f∗    e ¡   ¡ e  e    ¡  e   ¡  e   ¡   e ¡   r r r r r fn f1 f2 f∗ Figure 1: Graphical model of the relation between the inducing variables u, the training latent functions values f = [ f1 , . . . , fn ] and the test function value f∗ . The thick horizontal line represents a set of fully connected nodes. The observations y1 , . . . , yn , y∗ (not shown) would dangle individually from the corresponding latent values, by way of the exact (factored) likelihood (5). Left graph: the fully connected graph corresponds to the case where no approximation is made to the full joint Gaussian process distribution between these variables. The inducing variables u are superﬂuous in this case, since all latent function values can communicate with all others. Right graph: assumption of conditional independence between training and test function values given u. This gives rise to the separation between training and test conditionals from (8). Notice that having cut the communication path between training and test latent function values, information from f can only be transmitted to f∗ via the inducing variables u. uncertainties, when only a part of the training data is even considered. We include it here mostly as a baseline against which to compare better sparse approximations. In Figure 5 top, left we see how the SoD method produces wide predictive distributions, when training on a randomly selected subset of 10 cases. A fair comparison to other methods would take into account that the computational complexity is independent of n as opposed to other more advanced methods. These extra computational resources could be spent in a number of ways, e.g. larger m, or an active (rather than random) selection of the m points. In this paper we will concentrate on understanding the theoretical foundations of the various approximations rather than investigating the necessary heuristics needed to turn the approximation schemes into actually practical algorithms. 4. The Subset of Regressors (SoR) Approximation The Subset of Regressors (SoR) algorithm was given by Silverman (1985), and mentioned again by Wahba et al. (1999). It was then adapted by Smola and Bartlett (2001) to propose a sparse greedy approximation to Gaussian process regression. SoR models are ﬁnite linear-in-the-parameters models with a particular prior on the weights. For any input x∗ , the corresponding function value f∗ is given by: f∗ = K∗,u wu , with −1 p(wu ) = N (0, Ku,u ) , (11) where there is one weight associated to each inducing input in Xu . Note that the covariance matrix for the prior on the weights is the inverse of that on u, such that we recover the exact GP prior on u, 1943 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN which is Gaussian with zero mean and covariance u = Ku,u wu ⇒ uu = Ku,u wu wu Ku,u = Ku,u . (12) −1 Using the effective prior on u and the fact that wu = Ku,u u we can redeﬁne the SoR model in an equivalent, more intuitive way: −1 f∗ = K∗,u Ku,u u , with u ∼ N (0, Ku,u ) . (13) We are now ready to integrate the SoR model in our unifying framework. Given that there is a deterministic relation between any f∗ and u, the approximate conditional distributions in the integral in eq. (8) are given by: −1 qSoR (f|u) = N (Kf,u Ku,u u, 0) , and −1 qSoR (f∗ |u) = N (K∗,u Ku,u u, 0) , (14) with zero conditional covariance, compare to (9). The effective prior implied by the SoR approximation is easily obtained from (8), giving qSoR (f, f∗ ) = N 0, Qf,f Qf,∗ Q∗,f Q∗,∗ , (15) −1 where we recall Qa,b Ka,u Ku,u Ku,b . A more descriptive name for this method, would be the Deterministic Inducing Conditional (DIC) approximation. We see that this approximate prior is degenerate. There are only m degrees of freedom in the model, which implies that only m linearly independent functions can be drawn from the prior. The m + 1-th one is a linear combination of the previous. For example, in a very low noise regime, the posterior could be severely constrained by only m training cases. The degeneracy of the prior causes unreasonable predictive distributions. Indeed, the approximate prior over functions is so restrictive, that given enough data only a very limited family of functions will be plausible under the posterior, leading to overconﬁdent predictive variances. This is a general problem of ﬁnite linear models with small numbers of weights (for more details see Rasmussen and Qui˜ onero-Candela, 2005). Figure 5, top, right panel, illustrates the unreasonable n predictive uncertainties of the SoR approximation on a toy dataset.7 The predictive distribution is obtained by using the SoR approximate prior (15) instead of the true prior in (4). For each algorithm we give two forms of the predictive distribution, one which is easy to interpret, and the other which is economical to compute with: qSoR (f∗ |y) = N Q∗,f (Qf,f + σ2 I)−1 y, Q∗,∗ − Q∗,f (Qf,f + σ2 I)−1 Qf,∗ , noise noise = N σ K∗,u Σ Ku,f y, K∗,u ΣKu,∗ , −2 (16a) (16b) where we have deﬁned Σ = (σ−2 Ku,f Kf,u + Ku,u )−1 . Equation (16a) is readily recognized as the regular prediction equation (6), except that the covariance K has everywhere been replaced by Q, which was already suggested by (15). This corresponds to replacing the covariance function k with −1 kSoR (xi , x j ) = k(xi , u)Ku,u k(u, x j ). The new covariance function has rank (at most) m. Thus we have the following 7. Wary of this fact, Smola and Bartlett (2001) propose using the predictive variances of the SoD, or a more accurate computationally costly alternative (more details are given by Qui˜ onero-Candela, 2004, Chapter 3). n 1944 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION Remark 4 The SoR approximation is equivalent to exact inference in the degenerate Gaussian −1 process with covariance function kSoR (xi , x j ) = k(xi , u)Ku,u k(u, x j ). The equivalent (16b) is computationally cheaper, and with (11) in mind, Σ is the covariance of the posterior on the weights wu . Note that as opposed to the subset of data method, all training cases are taken into account. The computational complexity is O (nm2 ) initially, and O (m) and O (m2 ) per test case for the predictive mean and variance respectively. 5. The Deterministic Training Conditional (DTC) Approximation Taking up ideas already contained in the work of Csat´ and Opper (2002), Seeger et al. (2003) o recently proposed another sparse approximation to Gaussian process regression, which does not suffer from the nonsensical predictive uncertainties of the SoR approximation, but that interestingly leads to exactly the same predictive mean. Seeger et al. (2003), who called the method Projected Latent Variables (PLV), presented the method as relying on a likelihood approximation, based on −1 the projection f = Kf,u Ku,u u: p(y|f) −1 q(y|u) = N (Kf,u Ku,u u, σ2 I) . noise (17) The method has also been called the Projected Process Approximation (PPA) by Rasmussen and Williams (2006, Chapter 8). One way of obtaining an equivalent model is to retain the usual likelihood, but to impose a deterministic training conditional and the exact test conditional from eq. (9b) −1 qDTC (f|u) = N (Kf,u Ku,u u, 0), and qDTC (f∗ |u) = p(f∗ |u) . (18) This reformulation has the advantage of allowing us to stick to our view of exact inference (with exact likelihood) with approximate priors. Indeed, under this model the conditional distribution of f given u is identical to that of the SoR, given in the left of (14). A systematic name for this approximation is the Deterministic Training Conditional (DTC). The fundamental difference with SoR is that DTC uses the exact test conditional (9b) instead of the deterministic relation between f∗ and u of SoR. The joint prior implied by DTC is given by: qDTC (f, f∗ ) = N 0, Qf,f Qf,∗ Q∗,f K∗,∗ , (19) which is surprisingly similar to the effective prior implied by the SoR approximation (15). The fundamental difference is that under the DTC approximation f∗ has a prior variance of its own, given by K∗,∗ . This prior variance reverses the behaviour of the predictive uncertainties, and turns them into sensible ones, see Figure 5 for an illustration. The predictive distribution is now given by: qDTC (f∗ |y) = N (Q∗,f (Qf,f + σ2 I)−1 y, K∗,∗ − Q∗,f (Qf,f + σ2 I)−1 Qf,∗ noise noise = N σ K∗,u Σ Ku,f y, K∗,∗ − Q∗,∗ + K∗,u ΣK∗,u , −2 (20a) (20b) where again we have deﬁned Σ = (σ−2 Ku,f Kf,u + Ku,u )−1 as in (16). The predictive mean for the DTC is identical to that of the SoR approximation (16), but the predictive variance replaces the Q∗,∗ from SoR with K∗,∗ (which is larger, since K∗,∗ − Q∗,∗ is positive deﬁnite). This added term is the predictive variance of the posterior of f∗ conditioned on u. It grows to the prior variance K∗,∗ as x∗ moves far from the inducing inputs in Xu . 1945 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN u    e ¡   ¡ e  e    ¡  e   ¡  e   ¡   e ¡   r r r f1 f2 fn f∗ Figure 2: Graphical model for the FITC approximation. Compared to those in Figure 1, all edges between latent function values have been removed: the latent function values are conditionally fully independent given the inducing variables u. Although strictly speaking the SoR and DTC approximations could also be represented by this graph, note that both further assume a deterministic relation between f and u. Remark 5 The only difference between the predictive distribution of DTC and SoR is the variance. The predictive variance of DTC is never smaller than that of SoR. Note, that since the covariances for training cases and test cases are computed differently, see (19), it follows that Remark 6 The DTC approximation does not correspond exactly to a Gaussian process, as the covariance between latent values depends on whether they are considered training or test cases, violating consistency, see Deﬁnition 1. The computational complexity has the same order as for SoR. 6. The Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) Approximation Recently Snelson and Ghahramani (2006) proposed another likelihood approximation to speed up Gaussian process regression, which they called Sparse Gaussian Processes using Pseudo-inputs (SGPP). While the DTC is based on the likelihood approximation given by (17), the SGPP proposes a more sophisticated likelihood approximation with a richer covariance p(y|f) −1 q(y|u) = N (Kf,u Ku,u u, diag[Kf,f − Qf,f ] + σ2 I) , noise (21) where diag[A] is a diagonal matrix whose elements match the diagonal of A. As we did in (18) for the DTC, we provide an alternative equivalent formulation called Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) based on the inducing conditionals: n qFITC (f|u) = ∏ p( fi |u) = N i=1 −1 Kf,u Ku,u u, diag[Kf,f −Qf,f ] , and qFITC ( f∗ |u) = p( f∗ |u) . (22) We see that as opposed to SoR and DTC, FITC does not impose a deterministic relation between f and u. Instead of ignoring the variance, FITC proposes an approximation to the training conditional distribution of f given u as a further independence assumption. In addition, the exact test conditional from (9b) is used in (22), although for reasons which will become clear towards the end of this 1946 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION section, we initially consider only a single test case, f∗ . The corresponding graphical model is given in Figure 2. The effective prior implied by the FITC is given by qFITC (f, f∗ ) = N 0, Qf,f − diag[Qf,f − Kf,f ] Qf,∗ Q∗,f K∗,∗ . (23) Note, that the sole difference between the DTC and FITC is that in the top left corner of the implied prior covariance, FITC replaces the approximate covariances of DTC by the exact ones on the diagonal. The predictive distribution is qFITC ( f∗ |y) = N Q∗,f (Qf,f + Λ)−1 y, K∗,∗ − Q∗,f (Qf,f + Λ)−1 Qf,∗ (24a) = N K∗,u ΣKu,f Λ−1 y, K∗,∗ − Q∗,∗ + K∗,u ΣKu,∗ , (24b) where we have deﬁned Σ = (Ku,u + Ku,f Λ−1 Kf,u )−1 and Λ = diag[Kf,f − Qf,f + σ2 I ]. The compunoise tational complexity is identical to that of SoR and DTC. So far we have only considered a single test case. There are two options for joint predictions, either 1) use the exact full test conditional from (9b), or 2) extend the additional factorizing assumption to the test conditional. Although Snelson and Ghahramani (2006) don’t explicitly discuss joint predictions, it would seem that they probably intend the second option. Whereas the additional independence assumption for the test cases is not really necessary for computational reasons, it does affect the nature of the approximation. Under option 1) the training and test covariance are computed differently, and thus this does not correspond to our strict deﬁnition of a GP model, but Remark 7 Iff the assumption of full independence is extended to the test conditional, the FITC approximation is equivalent to exact inference in a non-degenerate Gaussian process with covariance function kFIC (xi , x j ) = kSoR (xi , x j ) + δi, j [k(xi , x j ) − kSoR (xi , x j )], where δi, j is Kronecker’s delta. A logical name for the method where the conditionals (training and test) are always forced to be fully independent would be the Fully Independent Conditional (FIC) approximation. The effective prior implied by FIC is: qFIC (f, f∗ ) = N 0, Qf,f − diag[Qf,f − Kf,f ] Qf,∗ Q∗,f Q∗,∗ − diag[Q∗,∗ − K∗,∗ ] . (25) 7. The Partially Independent Training Conditional (PITC) Approximation In the previous section we saw how to improve the DTC approximation by approximating the training conditional with an independent distribution, i.e. one with a diagonal covariance matrix. In this section we will further improve the approximation (while remaining computationally attractive) by extending the training conditional to have a block diagonal covariance: −1 qPITC (f|u) = N Kf,u Ku,u u, blockdiag[Kf,f − Qf,f ] , and qPITC (f∗ |u) = p(f∗ |u) . (26) where blockdiag[A] is a block diagonal matrix (where the blocking structure is not explicitly stated). We represent graphically the PITC approximation in Figure 3. Developing this analogously to the FITC approximation from the previous section, we get the joint prior qPITC (f, f∗ ) = N 0, Qf,f − blockdiag[Qf,f − Kf,f ] Qf,∗ Q∗,f K∗,∗ 1947 , (27) ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN u    e ¡   ¡ e  e    ¡  e   ¡  e   ¡   e ¡   r r r fI fI fI f∗ 1 2 k Figure 3: Graphical representation of the PITC approximation. The set of latent function values fIi indexed by the the set of indices Ii is fully connected. The PITC differs from FITC (see graph in Fig. 2) in that conditional independence is now between the k groups of training latent function values. This corresponds to the block diagonal approximation to the true training conditional given in (26). and the predictive distribution is identical to (24), except for the alternative deﬁnition of Λ = blockdiag[Kf,f − Qf,f + σ2 I ]. An identical expression was obtained by Schwaighofer and Tresp noise (2003, Sect. 3), developing from the original Bayesian committee machine (BCM) by Tresp (2000). The relationship to the FITC was pointed out by Lehel Csat´ . The BCM was originally proposed as o a transductive learner (i.e. where the test inputs have to be known before training), and the inducing inputs Xu were chosen to be the test inputs. We discuss transduction in detail in the next section. It is important to realize that the BCM proposes two orthogonal ideas: ﬁrst, the block diagonal structure of the partially independent training conditional, and second setting the inducing inputs to be the test inputs. These two ideas can be used independently and in Section 8 we propose using the ﬁrst without the second. The computational complexity of the PITC approximation depends on the blocking structure imposed in (26). A reasonable choice, also recommended by Tresp (2000) may be to choose k = n/m blocks, each of size m × m. The computational complexity remains O (nm2 ). Since in the PITC model the covariance is computed differently for training and test cases Remark 8 The PITC approximation does not correspond exactly to a Gaussian process. This is because computing covariances requires knowing whether points are from the training- or test-set, (27). One can obtain a Gaussian process from the PITC by extending the partial conditional independence assumption to the test conditional, as we did in Remark 7 for the FITC. 8. Transduction and Augmentation The idea of transduction is that one should restrict the goal of learning to prediction on a prespeciﬁed set of test cases, rather than trying to learn an entire function (induction) and then evaluate it at the test inputs. There may be no universally agreed upon deﬁnition of transduction. In this paper we use Deﬁnition 9 Transduction occurs only if the predictive distribution depends on other test inputs. This operational deﬁnition excludes models for which there exist an equivalent inductive counterpart. According to this deﬁnition, it is irrelevant when the bulk of the computation takes place. 1948 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION u f∗   e  ¡     ¡ e   e ¡     ¡     e e   ¡       e ¡   r r r fI fI fI 1 2 k Figure 4: Two views on Augmentation. One view is to see that the test latent function value f∗ is now part of the inducing variables u and therefore has access to the training latent function values. An equivalent view is to consider that we have dropped the assumption of conditional independence between f∗ and the training latent function values. Even if f∗ has now direct access to each of the training fi , these still need to go through u to talk to each other if they fall in conditionally independent blocks. We have in this ﬁgure decided to recycle the graph for PITC from Figure 3 to show that all approximations we have presented can be augmented, irrespective of what the approximation for the training conditional is. There are several different possible motivations for transduction: 1) transduction is somehow easier than induction (Vapnik, 1995), 2) the test inputs may reveal important information, which should be used during training. This motivation drives models in semi-supervised learning (studied mostly in the context of classiﬁcation) and 3) for approximate algorithms one may be able to limit the discrepancies of the approximation at the test points. For exact GP models it seems that the ﬁrst reason doesn’t really apply. If you make predictions at the test points that are consistent with a GP, then it is trivial inside the GP framework to extend these to any other input points, and in effect we have done induction. The second reason seems more interesting. However, in a standard GP setting, it is a consequence of the consistency property, see Remark 2, that predictions at one test input are independent of the location of any other test inputs. Therefore transduction can not be married with exact GPs: Remark 10 Transduction can not occur in exact Gaussian process models. Whereas this holds for the usual setting of GPs, it could be different in non-standard situations where e.g. the covariance function depends on the empirical input densities. Transduction can occur in the sparse approximation to GPs, by making the choice of inducing variables depend on the test inputs. The BCM from the previous section, where Xu = X∗ (where X∗ are the test inputs) is an example of this. Since the inducing variables are connected to all other nodes (see Figure 3) we would expect the approximation to be good at u = f∗ , which is what we care about for predictions, relating to reason 3) above. While this reasoning is sound, it is not necessarily a sufﬁcient consideration for getting a good model. The model has to be able to simultaneously explain the training targets as well and if the choice of u makes this difﬁcult, the posterior at the points of interest may be distorted. Thus, the choice of u should be governed by the ability to model the conditional of the latents given the inputs, and not solely by the density of the (test) inputs. The main drawback of transduction is that by its nature it doesn’t provide a predictive model in the way inductive models do. In the usual GP model one can do the bulk of the computation 1949 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN involved in the predictive distributions (e.g. matrix inversion) before seeing the test cases, enabling fast computation of test predictions. It is interesting that whereas other methods spend much effort trying to optimize the inducing variables, the BCM simply uses the test set. The quality of the BCM approximation depends then on the particular location of the test inputs, upon which one usually does not have any control. We now see that there may be a better method, eliminating the drawback of transduction, namely use the PITC approximation, but choose the u’s carefully (see Section 9), don’t just use the test set. 8.1 Augmentation An idea closely related to transduction, but not covered by our deﬁnition, is augmentation, which in contrast to transduction is done individually for each test case. Since in the previous sections, we haven’t assumed anything about u, we can simply augment the set of inducing variables by f∗ (i.e. have one additional inducing variable equal to the current test latent), and see what happens in the predictive distributions for the different methods. Let’s ﬁrst investigate the consequences for the test conditional from (9b). Note, the interpretation of the covariance matrix K∗,∗ − Q∗,∗ was “the prior covariance minus the information which u provides about f∗ ”. It is clear that the augmented u (with f∗ ) provides all possible information about f∗ , and consequently Q∗,∗ = K∗,∗ . An equivalent view on augmentation is that the assumption of conditional independence between f∗ and f is dropped. This is seen trivially by adding edges between f∗ and the fi in the graphical model, Figure 4. Augmentation was originally proposed by Rasmussen (2002), and applied in detail to the SoR with RBF covariance by Qui˜ onero-Candela (2004). Because the SoR is a ﬁnite linear model, and n the basis functions are local (Gaussian bumps), the predictive distributions can be very misleading. For example, when making predictions far away from the center of any basis function, all basis functions have insigniﬁcant magnitudes, and the prediction (averaged over the posterior) will be close to zero, with very small error-bars; this is the opposite of the desired behaviour, where we would expect the error-bars to grow as we move away from the training cases. Here augmentation makes a particularly big difference turning the nonsensical predictive distribution into a reasonable one, by ensuring that there is always a basis function centered on the test case. Compare the nonaugmented to the augmented SoR in Figure 5. An analogous Gaussian process based ﬁnite linear model that has recently been healed by augmentation is the relevance vector machine (Rasmussen and Qui˜ onero-Candela, 2005). n Although augmentation was initially proposed for a narrow set of circumstances, it is easily applied to any of the approximations discussed. Of course, augmentation doesn’t make any sense for an exact, non-degenerate Gaussian process model (a GP with a covariance function that has a feature-space which is inﬁnite dimensional, i.e. with basis functions everywhere). Remark 11 A full non-degenerate Gaussian process cannot be augmented, since the corresponding f∗ would already be connected to all other variables in the graphical model. But augmentation does make sense for sparse approximations to GPs. The more general process view on augmentation has several advantages over the basis function view. It is not completely clear from the basis function view, which basis function should be used for augmentation. For example, Rasmussen and Qui˜ onero-Candela (2005) successfully apply augn mentation using basis functions that have a zero contribution at the test location! In the process view 1950 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION however, it seems clear that one would chose the additional inducing variable to be f∗ , to minimize the effects of the approximations. Let us compute the effective prior for the augmented SoR. Given that f∗ is in the inducing set, the test conditional is not an approximation and we can rewrite the integral leading to the effective prior: Z qASoR (f∗ , f) = qSoR (f| f∗ , u) p( f∗ , u) du . (28) It is interesting to notice that this is also the effective prior that would result from augmenting the DTC approximation, since qSoR (f| f∗ , u) = qDTC (f| f∗ , u). Remark 12 Augmented SoR (ASoR) is equivalent to augmented DTC (ADTC). Augmented DTC only differs from DTC in the additional presence of f∗ among the inducing variables in the training conditional. We can only expect augmented DTC to be a more accurate approximation than DTC, since adding an additional inducing variable can only help capture information from y. Therefore Remark 13 DTC is a less accurate (but cheaper) approximation than augmented SoR. We saw previously in Section 5 that the DTC approximation does not suffer from the nonsensical predictive variances of the SoR. The equivalence between the augmented SoR and augmented DTC is another way of seeing how augmentation reverses the misbehaviour of SoR. The predictive distribution of the augmented SoR is obtained by adding f∗ to u in (20). Prediction with an augmented sparse model comes at a higher computational cost, since now f∗ directly interacts with all of f and not just with u. For each new test case, updating the augmented Σ in the predictive equation (for example (20b) for DTC) implies computing the vector matrix product K∗,f Kf,u with complexity O (nm). This is clearly higher than the O (m) for the mean, and O (m2 ) for the predictive distribution of all the non-augmented methods we have discussed. Augmentation seems to be only really necessary for methods that make a severe approximation to the test conditional, like the SoR. For methods that make little or no approximation to the test conditional, it is difﬁcult to predict the degree to which augmentation would help. However, one can see by giving f∗ access to all of the training latent function values in f, one would expect augmentation to give less under-conﬁdent predictive distributions near the training data. Figure 5 clearly shows that augmented DTC (equivalent to augmented SoR) has a superior predictive distribution (both mean and variance) than standard DTC. Note however that in the ﬁgure we have purposely chosen a too short lengthscale to enhance visualization. Quantitatively, this superiority was experimentally assessed by Qui˜ onero-Candela (2004, Table 3.1). Augmentation hasn’t been n compared to the more advanced approximations FITC and PITC, and the ﬁgure would change in the more realistic scenario where the inducing inputs and hyperparameters are learnt (Snelson and Ghahramani, 2006). Transductive methods like the BCM can be seen as joint augmentation, and one could potentially use it for any of the methods presented. It seems that the good performance of the BCM could essentially stem from augmentation, the presence of the other test inputs in the inducing set being probably of little beneﬁt. Joint augmentation might bring some computational advantage, but won’t change the scaling: note that augmenting m times at a cost of O (nm) apiece implies the same O (nm2 ) total cost as the jointly augmented BCM. 1951 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN SoD SoR 1.5 1.5 1 1 0.5 0.5 0 0 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −1 −1.5 −15 −10 −5 0 5 10 15 −1.5 −15 −10 −5 DTC 0 5 10 15 5 10 15 5 10 15 ASoR/ADTC 1.5 1.5 1 1 0.5 0.5 0 0 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −1 −1.5 −15 −10 −5 0 5 10 15 −1.5 −15 −10 −5 FITC 0 PITC 1.5 1.5 1 1 0.5 0.5 0 0 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −1 −1.5 −15 −10 −5 0 5 10 15 −1.5 −15 −10 −5 0 Figure 5: Toy example with identical covariance function and hyperparameters.

Augmented DTC (ADTC) is equivalent to augmented SoR (ASoR), see Remark 12. 1952 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION 9. On the Choice of the Inducing Variables We have until now assumed that the inducing inputs Xu were given. Traditionally, sparse models have very often been built upon a carefully chosen subset of the training inputs. This concept is probably best exempliﬁed in the popular support vector machine (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). In sparse Gaussian processes it has also been suggested to select the inducing inputs Xu from among the training inputs. Since this involves a prohibitive combinatorial optimization, greedy optimization approaches have been suggested using various selection criteria like online learning (Csat´ and o Opper, 2002), greedy posterior maximization (Smola and Bartlett, 2001), maximum information gain (Seeger et al., 2003), matching pursuit (Keerthi and Chu, 2006), and probably more. As discussed in the previous section, selecting the inducing inputs from among the test inputs has also been considered in transductive settings. Recently, Snelson and Ghahramani (2006) have proposed to relax the constraint that the inducing variables must be a subset of training/test cases, turning the discrete selection problem into one of continuous optimization. One may hope that ﬁnding a good solution is easier in the continuous than the discrete case, although ﬁnding the global optimum is intractable in both cases. And perhaps the less restrictive choice can lead to better performance in very sparse models. Which optimality criterion should be used to set the inducing inputs? Departing from a fully Bayesian treatment which would involve deﬁning priors on Xu , one could maximize the marginal likelihood (also called the evidence) with respect to Xu , an approach also followed by Snelson and Ghahramani (2006). Each of the approximate methods proposed involves a different effective prior, and hence its own particular effective marginal likelihood conditioned on the inducing inputs q(y|Xu ) = ZZ p(y|f) q(f|u) p(u|Xu )du df = Z p(y|f) q(f|Xu )df , (29) which of course is independent of the test conditional. We have in the above equation explicitly conditioned on the inducing inputs Xu . Using Gaussian identities, the effective marginal likelihood is very easily obtained by adding a ridge σ2 I (from the likelihood) to the covariance of effective noise prior on f. Using the appropriate deﬁnitions of Λ, the log marginal likelihood becomes 1 log q(y|Xu ) = − 2 log |Qf,f + Λ| − 1 y (Qf,f + Λ)−1 y − n log(2π) , 2 2 (30) where ΛSoR = ΛDTC = σ2 I, ΛFITC = diag[Kf,f − Qf,f ] + σ2 I, and ΛPITC = blockdiag[Kf,f − noise noise Qf,f ] + σ2 I. The computational cost of the marginal likelihood is O (nm2 ) for all methods, that of noise its gradient with respect to one element of Xu is O (nm). This of course implies that the complexity of computing the gradient wrt. to the whole of Xu is O (dnm2 ), where d is the dimension of the input space. It has been proposed to maximize the effective posterior instead of the effective marginal likelihood (Smola and Bartlett, 2001). However this is potentially dangerous and can lead to overﬁtting. Maximizing the whole evidence instead is sound and comes at an identical computational cost (for a deeper analysis see Qui˜ onero-Candela, 2004, Sect. 3.3.5 and Fig. 3.2). n The marginal likelihood has traditionally been used to learn the hyperparameters of GPs in the non fully Bayesian treatment (see for example Williams and Rasmussen, 1996). For the sparse approximations presented here, once you are learning Xu it is straightforward to allow for learning hyperparameters (of the covariance function) during the same optimization, and there is no need to interleave optimization of u with learning of the hyperparameters as it has been proposed for example by Seeger et al. (2003). 1953 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN 10. Other Methods In this section we brieﬂy mention two approximations which don’t ﬁt in our unifying scheme, since one doesn’t correspond to a proper probabilistic model, and the other one uses a particular construction for the covariance function, rather than allowing any general covariance function. 10.1 The Nystr¨ m Approximation o The Nystr¨ m Approximation for speeding up GP regression was originally proposed by Williams o and Seeger (2001), and then questioned by Williams et al. (2002). Like SoR and DTC, the Nystr¨ m o Approximation for GP regression approximates the prior covariance of f by Qf,f . However, unlike these methods, the Nystr¨ m Approximation is not based on a generative probabilistic model. The o prior covariance between f∗ and f is taken to be exact, which is inconsistent with the prior covariance on f: Qf,f Kf,∗ . (31) q(f, f∗ ) = N 0, K∗,f K∗,∗ As a result we cannot derive this method from our unifying framework, nor represent it with a graphical model. Worse, the resulting prior covariance matrix is not even guaranteed to be positive deﬁnite, allowing the predictive variances to be negative. Notice that replacing Kf,∗ by Qf,∗ in (31) is enough to make the prior covariance positive deﬁnite, and one obtains the DTC approximation. Remark 14 The Nystr¨ m Approximation does not correspond to a well-formed probabilistic model. o Ignoring any quibbles about positive deﬁniteness, the predictive distribution of the Nystr¨ m Apo proximation is given by: p( f∗ |y) = N Kf,∗ [Qf,f + σ2 I]−1 y, K∗,∗ − Kf,∗ [Qf,f + σ2 I]−1 Kf,∗ , noise noise (32) but the predictive variance is not guaranteed to be positive. The computational cost is O (nm2 ). 10.2 The Relevance Vector Machine The relevance vector machine, introduced by Tipping (2001), is a ﬁnite linear model with an independent Gaussian prior imposed on the weights. For any input x∗ , the corresponding function output is given by: f∗ = φ∗ w , with p(w|A) = N (0, A) , (33) where φ∗ = [φ1 (x), . . . , φm (x)] is the (row) vector of responses of the m basis functions, and A = diag(α1 , . . . , αm ) is the diagonal matrix of joint prior precisions (inverse variances) of the weights. The αi are learnt by maximizing the RVM evidence (obtained by also assuming Gaussian additive iid. noise, see (1)), and for the typical case of rich enough sets of basis functions many of the precisions go to inﬁnity effectively pruning out the corresponding weights (for a very interesting analysis see Wipf et al., 2004). The RVM is thus a sparse method and the surviving basis functions are called relevance vectors. Note that since the RVM is a ﬁnite linear model with Gaussian priors on the weights, it can be seen as a Gaussian process: Remark 15 The RVM is equivalent to a degenerate Gaussian process with covariance function kRVM (xi , x j ) = φi A−1 φ j = ∑m α−1 φk (xi ) φk (x j ), k=1 k 1954 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION q(f∗ |u) q(f|u) GP exact exact SoR determ. determ.

All these methods are detailed in the previous sections. The initial cost and that of the mean and variance per test case are respectively n2 , n and n2 for the exact GP, and nm2 , m and m2 for all other methods. The “GP?” column indicates whether the approximation is equivalent to a GP. For FITC see Remark 7. as was also pointed out by Tipping (2001, eq. (59)). Whereas all sparse approximations we have presented until now are totally independent of the choice of covariance function, for the RVM this choice is restricted to covariance functions that can be expressed as ﬁnite expansions in terms of some basis functions. Being degenerate GPs in exactly the same way as the SoR (presented in Section 4), the RVM does also suffer from unreasonable predictive variances. Rasmussen and Qui˜ onero-Candela (2005) show that the predictive distributions of RVMs can also be healed by n augmentation, see Section 8. Once the αi have been learnt, denoting by m the number of surviving relevance vectors, the complexity of computing the predictive distribution of the RVM is O (m) for mean and O (m2 ) for the variance. RVMs are often used with radial basis functions centered on the training inputs. One potentially interesting extension to the RVM would be to learn the locations of the centers of the basis functions, in the same way as proposed by Snelson and Ghahramani (2006) for the FITC approximation, see Section 6. This is a curious reminiscence of learning the centers in RBF Networks. 11. Conclusions We have provided a unifying framework for sparse approximations to Gaussian processes for regression. Our approach consists of two steps, ﬁrst 1) we recast the approximation in terms of approximations to the prior, and second 2) we introduce inducing variables u and the idea of conditional independence given u. We recover all existing sparse methods by making further simpliﬁcations of the covariances of the training and test conditionals, see Table 1 for a summary. Previous methods were presented based on different approximation paradigms (e.g. likelihood approximations, projection methods, matrix approximations, minimization of Kullback-Leibler divergence, etc), making direct comparison difﬁcult. Under our unifying view we deconstruct methods, making it clear which building blocks they are based upon. For example, the SGPP by Snelson 1955 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN and Ghahramani (2006) contains two ideas, 1) a likelihood approximation and 2) the idea of varying the inducing inputs continuously; these two ideas could easily be used independently, and incorporated in other methods. Similarly, the BCM by Tresp (2000) contains two independent ideas 1) a block diagonal assumption, and 2) the (transductive) idea of choosing the test inputs as the inducing variables. Finally we note that although all three ideas of 1) transductively setting u = f∗ , 2) augmentation and 3) continuous optimization of Xu have been proposed in very speciﬁc settings, in fact they are completely general ideas, which can be applied to any of the approximation schemes considered. We have ranked the approximation according to how close they are to the corresponding full GP. However, the performance in practical situations may not always follow this theoretical ranking since the approximations might exhibit properties (not present in the full GP) which may be particularly suitable for speciﬁc datasets. This may make the interpretation of empirical comparisons challenging. A further complication arises when adding the necessary heuristics for turning the theoretical constructs into practical algorithms. We have not described full algorithms in this paper, but are currently working on a detailed empirical study (in preparation, see also Rasmussen and Williams, 2006, chapter 8). We note that the order of the computational complexity is identical for all the methods considered, O (nm2 ). This highlights that there is no computational excuse for using gross approximations, such as assuming deterministic relationships, in particular one should probably think twice before using SoR or even DTC. Although augmentation has attractive predictive properties, it is computationally expensive. It remains unclear whether augmentation could be beneﬁcial on a ﬁxed computational budget. We have only considered the simpler case of regression in this paper, but sparseness is also commonly sought in classiﬁcation settings. It should not be difﬁcult to cast probabilistic approximation methods such as Expectation Propagation (EP) or the Laplace method (for a comparison, see Kuss and Rasmussen, 2005) into our unifying framework. Our analysis suggests that a new interesting approximation would come from combining the best possible approximation (PITC) with the most powerful selection method for the inducing inputs. This would correspond to a non-transductive version of the BCM. We would evade the necessity of knowing the test set before doing the bulk of the computation, and we could hope to supersede the superior performance reported by Snelson and Ghahramani (2006) for very sparse approximations.

Gaussian and Matrix Identities In this appendix we provide identities used to manipulate matrices and Gaussian distributions throughout the paper. Let x and y be jointly Gaussian x y µx µy ∼ N , A C C B , (34) then the marginal and the conditional are given by x ∼ N (µx , A) , and x|y ∼ N µx +C B−1 (y − µy ), A −C B−1C (35) Also, the product of a Gaussian in x with a Gaussian in a linear projection P x is again a Gaussian, although unnormalized N (x|a, A) N (P x|b, B) = zc N (x|c,C) , (36) where C = A−1 + P B−1 P −1 c = C A−1 a + P B−1 b . , The normalizing constant zc is gaussian in the means a and b of the two Gaussians: m 1 1 zc = (2 π)− 2 |B + P A P |− 2 exp − 2 (b − P a) B+PAP −1 (b − P a) . (37) The matrix inversion lemma, also known as the Woodbury, Sherman & Morrison formula states that: (Z +UWV )−1 = Z −1 − Z −1U(W −1 +V Z −1U)−1V Z −1 , (38) assuming the relevant inverses all exist. Here Z is n × n, W is m × m and U and V are both of size n × m; consequently if Z −1 is known, and a low rank (ie. m < n) perturbation are made to Z as in left hand side of eq. (38), considerable speedup can be achieved. References Corinna Cortes and Vladimir Vapnik. Support-vector network. Machine Learning, 20(3):273–297, 1995. Lehel Csat´ and Manfred Opper.

<p>Author: Petros Drineas, Michael W. Mahoney</p><p>Abstract: A problem for many kernel-based methods is that the amount of computation required to ﬁnd the solution scales as O(n3 ), where n is the number of training examples. We develop and analyze an algorithm to compute an easily-interpretable low-rank approximation to an n × n Gram matrix G such that computations of interest may be performed more rapidly. The approximation is of ˜ the form Gk = CWk+CT , where C is a matrix consisting of a small number c of columns of G and Wk is the best rank-k approximation to W , the matrix formed by the intersection between those c columns of G and the corresponding c rows of G. An important aspect of the algorithm is the probability distribution used to randomly sample the columns; we will use a judiciously-chosen and data-dependent nonuniform probability distribution. Let · 2 and · F denote the spectral norm and the Frobenius norm, respectively, of a matrix, and let Gk be the best rank-k approximation to G. We prove that by choosing O(k/ε4 ) columns G −CWk+CT ξ ≤ G − Gk ξ +ε n ∑ G2 , ii i=1 both in expectation and with high probability, for both ξ = 2, F, and for all k : 0 ≤ k ≤ rank(W ). This approximation can be computed using O(n) additional space and time, after making two passes over the data from external storage. The relationships between this algorithm, other related matrix decompositions, and the Nystr¨ m method from integral equation theory are discussed.1 o Keywords: kernel methods, randomized algorithms, Gram matrix, Nystr¨ m method o</p><p>2 0.16815427 <a title="60-lsi-2" href="./jmlr-2005-Feature_Selection_for_Unsupervised_and_Supervised_Inference%3A_The_Emergence_of_Sparsity_in_a_Weight-Based_Approach.html">34 jmlr-2005-Feature Selection for Unsupervised and Supervised Inference: The Emergence of Sparsity in a Weight-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Lior Wolf, Amnon Shashua</p><p>Abstract: The problem of selecting a subset of relevant features in a potentially overwhelming quantity of data is classic and found in many branches of science. Examples in computer vision, text processing and more recently bio-informatics are abundant. In text classiﬁcation tasks, for example, it is not uncommon to have 104 to 107 features of the size of the vocabulary containing word frequency counts, with the expectation that only a small fraction of them are relevant. Typical examples include the automatic sorting of URLs into a web directory and the detection of spam email. In this work we present a deﬁnition of “relevancy” based on spectral properties of the Laplacian of the features’ measurement matrix. The feature selection process is then based on a continuous ranking of the features deﬁned by a least-squares optimization process. A remarkable property of the feature relevance function is that sparse solutions for the ranking values naturally emerge as a result of a “biased non-negativity” of a key matrix in the process. As a result, a simple leastsquares optimization process converges onto a sparse solution, i.e., a selection of a subset of features which form a local maximum over the relevance function. The feature selection algorithm can be embedded in both unsupervised and supervised inference problems and empirical evidence show that the feature selections typically achieve high accuracy even when only a small fraction of the features are relevant.</p><p>3 0.15915848 <a title="60-lsi-3" href="./jmlr-2005-A_Unifying_View_of_Sparse_Approximate_Gaussian_Process_Regression.html">7 jmlr-2005-A Unifying View of Sparse Approximate Gaussian Process Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Joaquin Quiñonero-Candela, Carl Edward Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We provide a new unifying view, including all existing proper probabilistic sparse approximations for Gaussian process regression. Our approach relies on expressing the effective prior which the methods are using. This allows new insights to be gained, and highlights the relationship between existing methods. It also allows for a clear theoretically justiﬁed ranking of the closeness of the known approximations to the corresponding full GPs. Finally we point directly to designs of new better sparse approximations, combining the best of the existing strategies, within attractive computational constraints. Keywords: Gaussian process, probabilistic regression, sparse approximation, Bayesian committee machine Regression models based on Gaussian processes (GPs) are simple to implement, ﬂexible, fully probabilistic models, and thus a powerful tool in many areas of application. Their main limitation is that memory requirements and computational demands grow as the square and cube respectively, of the number of training cases n, effectively limiting a direct implementation to problems with at most a few thousand cases. To overcome the computational limitations numerous authors have recently suggested a wealth of sparse approximations. Common to all these approximation schemes is that only a subset of the latent variables are treated exactly, and the remaining variables are given some approximate, but computationally cheaper treatment. However, the published algorithms have widely different motivations, emphasis and exposition, so it is difﬁcult to get an overview (see Rasmussen and Williams, 2006, chapter 8) of how they relate to each other, and which can be expected to give rise to the best algorithms. In this paper we provide a unifying view of sparse approximations for GP regression. Our approach is simple, but powerful: for each algorithm we analyze the posterior, and compute the effective prior which it is using. Thus, we reinterpret the algorithms as “exact inference with an approximated prior”, rather than the existing (ubiquitous) interpretation “approximate inference with the exact prior”. This approach has the advantage of directly expressing the approximations in terms of prior assumptions about the function, which makes the consequences of the approximations much easier to understand. While our view of the approximations is not the only one possible, it has the advantage of putting all existing probabilistic sparse approximations under one umbrella, thus enabling direct comparison and revealing the relation between them. In Section 1 we brieﬂy introduce GP models for regression. In Section 2 we present our unifying framework and write out the key equations in preparation for the unifying analysis of sparse c 2005 Joaquin Qui˜ onero-Candela and Carl Edward Rasmussen. n ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN algorithms in Sections 4-7. The relation of transduction and augmentation to our sparse framework is covered in Section 8. All our approximations are written in terms of a new set of inducing variables. The choice of these variables is itself a challenging problem, and is discussed in Section 9. We comment on a few special approximations outside our general scheme in Section 10 and conclusions are drawn at the end. 1. Gaussian Processes for Regression Probabilistic regression is usually formulated as follows: given a training set D = {(xi , yi ), i = 1, . . . , n} of n pairs of (vectorial) inputs xi and noisy (real, scalar) outputs yi , compute the predictive distribution of the function values f∗ (or noisy y∗ ) at test locations x∗ . In the simplest case (which we deal with here) we assume that the noise is additive, independent and Gaussian, such that the relationship between the (latent) function f (x) and the observed noisy targets y are given by yi = f (xi ) + εi , where εi ∼ N (0, σ2 ) , noise (1) where σ2 is the variance of the noise. noise Deﬁnition 1 A Gaussian process (GP) is a collection of random variables, any ﬁnite number of which have consistent1 joint Gaussian distributions. Gaussian process (GP) regression is a Bayesian approach which assumes a GP prior2 over functions, i.e. assumes a priori that function values behave according to p(f|x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = N (0, K) , (2) where f = [ f1 , f2 , . . . , fn ] is a vector of latent function values, fi = f (xi ) and K is a covariance matrix, whose entries are given by the covariance function, Ki j = k(xi , x j ). Note that the GP treats the latent function values fi as random variables, indexed by the corresponding input. In the following, for simplicity we will always neglect the explicit conditioning on the inputs; the GP model and all expressions are always conditional on the corresponding inputs. The GP model is concerned only with the conditional of the outputs given the inputs; we do not model anything about the inputs themselves. Remark 2 Note, that to adhere to a strict Bayesian formalism, the GP covariance function,3 which deﬁnes the prior, should not depend on the data (although it can depend on additional parameters). As we will see in later sections, some approximations are strictly equivalent to GPs, while others are not. That is, the implied prior may still be multivariate Gaussian, but the covariance function may be different for training and test cases. Deﬁnition 3 A Gaussian process is called degenerate iff the covariance function has a ﬁnite number of non-zero eigenvalues. 1. By consistency is meant simply that the random variables obey the usual rules of marginalization, etc. 2. For notational simplicity we exclusively use zero-mean priors. 3. The covariance function itself shouldn’t depend on the data, though its value at a speciﬁc pair of inputs of course will. 1940 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION Degenerate GPs (such as e.g. with polynomial covariance function) correspond to ﬁnite linear (-in-the-parameters) models, whereas non-degenerate GPs (such as e.g. with squared exponential or RBF covariance function) do not. The prior for a ﬁnite m dimensional linear model only considers a universe of at most m linearly independent functions; this may often be too restrictive when n m. Note however, that non-degeneracy on its own doesn’t guarantee the existence of the “right kind” of ﬂexibility for a given particular modelling task. For a more detailed background on GP models, see for example that of Rasmussen and Williams (2006). Inference in the GP model is simple: we put a joint GP prior on training and test latent values, f and f∗ 4 , and combine it with the likelihood5 p(y|f) using Bayes rule, to obtain the joint posterior p(f, f∗ )p(y|f) . p(y) p(f, f∗ |y) = (3) The ﬁnal step needed to produce the desired posterior predictive distribution is to marginalize out the unwanted training set latent variables: p(f∗ |y) = Z 1 p(y) p(f, f∗ |y)df = Z p(y|f) p(f, f∗ ) df , (4) or in words: the predictive distribution is the marginal of the renormalized joint prior times the likelihood. The joint GP prior and the independent likelihood are both Gaussian p(f, f∗ ) = N 0, Kf,f K∗,f Kf,∗ K∗,∗ , and p(y|f) = N (f, σ2 I) , noise (5) where K is subscript by the variables between which the covariance is computed (and we use the asterisk ∗ as shorthand for f∗ ) and I is the identity matrix. Since both factors in the integral are Gaussian, the integral can be evaluated in closed form to give the Gaussian predictive distribution p(f∗ |y) = N K∗,f (Kf,f + σ2 I)−1 y, K∗,∗ − K∗,f (Kf,f + σ2 I)−1 Kf,∗ , noise noise (6) see the relevant Gaussian identity in appendix A. The problem with the above expression is that it requires inversion of a matrix of size n × n which requires O (n3 ) operations, where n is the number of training cases. Thus, the simple exact implementation can handle problems with at most a few thousand training cases. 2. A New Unifying View We now seek to modify the joint prior p(f∗ , f) from (5) in ways which will reduce the computational requirements from (6). Let us ﬁrst rewrite that prior by introducing an additional set of m latent variables u = [u1 , . . . , um ] , which we call the inducing variables. These latent variables are values of the Gaussian process (as also f and f∗ ), corresponding to a set of input locations Xu , which we call the inducing inputs. Whereas the additional latent variables u are always marginalized out in the predictive distribution, the choice of inducing inputs does leave an imprint on the ﬁnal solution. 4. We will mostly consider a vector of test cases f∗ (rather than a single f∗ ). 5. You may have been expecting the likelihood written as p(y|f∗ , f) but since the likelihood is conditionally independent of everything else given f, this makes no difference. 1941 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN The inducing variables will turn out to be generalizations of variables which other authors have referred to variously as “support points”, “active set” or “pseudo-inputs”. Particular sparse algorithms choose the inducing variables in various different ways; some algorithms chose the inducing inputs to be a subset of the training set, others not, as we will discuss in Section 9. For now consider any arbitrary inducing variables. Due to the consistency of Gaussian processes, we know that we can recover p(f∗ , f) by simply integrating (marginalizing) out u from the joint GP prior p(f∗ , f, u) p(f∗ , f) = Z p(f∗ , f, u) du = Z p(f∗ , f|u) p(u) du, where p(u) = N (0, Ku,u ) . (7) This is an exact expression. Now, we introduce the fundamental approximation which gives rise to almost all sparse approximations. We approximate the joint prior by assuming that f∗ and f are conditionally independent given u, see Figure 1, such that p(f∗ , f) q(f∗ , f) = Z q(f∗ |u) q(f|u) p(u) du . (8) The name inducing variable is motivated by the fact that f and f∗ can only communicate though u, and u therefore induces the dependencies between training and test cases. As we shall detail in the following sections, the different computationally efﬁcient algorithms proposed in the literature correspond to different additional assumptions about the two approximate inducing conditionals q(f|u), q(f∗ |u) of the integral in (8). It will be useful for future reference to specify here the exact expressions for the two conditionals training conditional: test conditional: −1 p(f|u) = N (Kf,u Ku,u u, Kf,f − Qf,f ) , −1 p(f∗ |u) = N (K∗,u Ku,u u, K∗,∗ − Q∗,∗ ) , (9a) (9b) −1 where we have introduced the shorthand notation6 Qa,b Ka,u Ku,u Ku,b . We can readily identify the expressions in (9) as special (noise free) cases of the standard predictive equation (6) with u playing the role of (noise free) observations. Note that the (positive semi-deﬁnite) covariance matrices in (9) have the form K − Q with the following interpretation: the prior covariance K minus a (non-negative deﬁnite) matrix Q quantifying how much information u provides about the variables in question (f or f∗ ). We emphasize that all the sparse methods discussed in the paper correspond simply to different approximations to the conditionals in (9), and throughout we use the exact likelihood and inducing prior p(y|f) = N (f, σ2 I) , and p(u) = N (0, Ku,u ) . (10) noise 3. The Subset of Data (SoD) Approximation Before we get started with the more sophisticated approximations, we mention as a baseline method the simplest possible sparse approximation (which doesn’t fall inside our general scheme): use only a subset of the data (SoD). The computational complexity is reduced to O (m3 ), where m < n. We would not generally expect SoD to be a competitive method, since it would seem impossible (even with fairly redundant data and a good choice of the subset) to get a realistic picture of the 6. Note, that Qa,b depends on u although this is not explicit in the notation. 1942 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION u u    e ¡   ¡ e  e    ¡  e   ¡  e   ¡   e ¡   r r r r r fn f1 f2 f∗    e ¡   ¡ e  e    ¡  e   ¡  e   ¡   e ¡   r r r r r fn f1 f2 f∗ Figure 1: Graphical model of the relation between the inducing variables u, the training latent functions values f = [ f1 , . . . , fn ] and the test function value f∗ . The thick horizontal line represents a set of fully connected nodes. The observations y1 , . . . , yn , y∗ (not shown) would dangle individually from the corresponding latent values, by way of the exact (factored) likelihood (5). Left graph: the fully connected graph corresponds to the case where no approximation is made to the full joint Gaussian process distribution between these variables. The inducing variables u are superﬂuous in this case, since all latent function values can communicate with all others. Right graph: assumption of conditional independence between training and test function values given u. This gives rise to the separation between training and test conditionals from (8). Notice that having cut the communication path between training and test latent function values, information from f can only be transmitted to f∗ via the inducing variables u. uncertainties, when only a part of the training data is even considered. We include it here mostly as a baseline against which to compare better sparse approximations. In Figure 5 top, left we see how the SoD method produces wide predictive distributions, when training on a randomly selected subset of 10 cases. A fair comparison to other methods would take into account that the computational complexity is independent of n as opposed to other more advanced methods. These extra computational resources could be spent in a number of ways, e.g. larger m, or an active (rather than random) selection of the m points. In this paper we will concentrate on understanding the theoretical foundations of the various approximations rather than investigating the necessary heuristics needed to turn the approximation schemes into actually practical algorithms. 4. The Subset of Regressors (SoR) Approximation The Subset of Regressors (SoR) algorithm was given by Silverman (1985), and mentioned again by Wahba et al. (1999). It was then adapted by Smola and Bartlett (2001) to propose a sparse greedy approximation to Gaussian process regression. SoR models are ﬁnite linear-in-the-parameters models with a particular prior on the weights. For any input x∗ , the corresponding function value f∗ is given by: f∗ = K∗,u wu , with −1 p(wu ) = N (0, Ku,u ) , (11) where there is one weight associated to each inducing input in Xu . Note that the covariance matrix for the prior on the weights is the inverse of that on u, such that we recover the exact GP prior on u, 1943 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN which is Gaussian with zero mean and covariance u = Ku,u wu ⇒ uu = Ku,u wu wu Ku,u = Ku,u . (12) −1 Using the effective prior on u and the fact that wu = Ku,u u we can redeﬁne the SoR model in an equivalent, more intuitive way: −1 f∗ = K∗,u Ku,u u , with u ∼ N (0, Ku,u ) . (13) We are now ready to integrate the SoR model in our unifying framework. Given that there is a deterministic relation between any f∗ and u, the approximate conditional distributions in the integral in eq. (8) are given by: −1 qSoR (f|u) = N (Kf,u Ku,u u, 0) , and −1 qSoR (f∗ |u) = N (K∗,u Ku,u u, 0) , (14) with zero conditional covariance, compare to (9). The effective prior implied by the SoR approximation is easily obtained from (8), giving qSoR (f, f∗ ) = N 0, Qf,f Qf,∗ Q∗,f Q∗,∗ , (15) −1 where we recall Qa,b Ka,u Ku,u Ku,b . A more descriptive name for this method, would be the Deterministic Inducing Conditional (DIC) approximation. We see that this approximate prior is degenerate. There are only m degrees of freedom in the model, which implies that only m linearly independent functions can be drawn from the prior. The m + 1-th one is a linear combination of the previous. For example, in a very low noise regime, the posterior could be severely constrained by only m training cases. The degeneracy of the prior causes unreasonable predictive distributions. Indeed, the approximate prior over functions is so restrictive, that given enough data only a very limited family of functions will be plausible under the posterior, leading to overconﬁdent predictive variances. This is a general problem of ﬁnite linear models with small numbers of weights (for more details see Rasmussen and Qui˜ onero-Candela, 2005). Figure 5, top, right panel, illustrates the unreasonable n predictive uncertainties of the SoR approximation on a toy dataset.7 The predictive distribution is obtained by using the SoR approximate prior (15) instead of the true prior in (4). For each algorithm we give two forms of the predictive distribution, one which is easy to interpret, and the other which is economical to compute with: qSoR (f∗ |y) = N Q∗,f (Qf,f + σ2 I)−1 y, Q∗,∗ − Q∗,f (Qf,f + σ2 I)−1 Qf,∗ , noise noise = N σ K∗,u Σ Ku,f y, K∗,u ΣKu,∗ , −2 (16a) (16b) where we have deﬁned Σ = (σ−2 Ku,f Kf,u + Ku,u )−1 . Equation (16a) is readily recognized as the regular prediction equation (6), except that the covariance K has everywhere been replaced by Q, which was already suggested by (15). This corresponds to replacing the covariance function k with −1 kSoR (xi , x j ) = k(xi , u)Ku,u k(u, x j ). The new covariance function has rank (at most) m. Thus we have the following 7. Wary of this fact, Smola and Bartlett (2001) propose using the predictive variances of the SoD, or a more accurate computationally costly alternative (more details are given by Qui˜ onero-Candela, 2004, Chapter 3). n 1944 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION Remark 4 The SoR approximation is equivalent to exact inference in the degenerate Gaussian −1 process with covariance function kSoR (xi , x j ) = k(xi , u)Ku,u k(u, x j ). The equivalent (16b) is computationally cheaper, and with (11) in mind, Σ is the covariance of the posterior on the weights wu . Note that as opposed to the subset of data method, all training cases are taken into account. The computational complexity is O (nm2 ) initially, and O (m) and O (m2 ) per test case for the predictive mean and variance respectively. 5. The Deterministic Training Conditional (DTC) Approximation Taking up ideas already contained in the work of Csat´ and Opper (2002), Seeger et al. (2003) o recently proposed another sparse approximation to Gaussian process regression, which does not suffer from the nonsensical predictive uncertainties of the SoR approximation, but that interestingly leads to exactly the same predictive mean. Seeger et al. (2003), who called the method Projected Latent Variables (PLV), presented the method as relying on a likelihood approximation, based on −1 the projection f = Kf,u Ku,u u: p(y|f) −1 q(y|u) = N (Kf,u Ku,u u, σ2 I) . noise (17) The method has also been called the Projected Process Approximation (PPA) by Rasmussen and Williams (2006, Chapter 8). One way of obtaining an equivalent model is to retain the usual likelihood, but to impose a deterministic training conditional and the exact test conditional from eq. (9b) −1 qDTC (f|u) = N (Kf,u Ku,u u, 0), and qDTC (f∗ |u) = p(f∗ |u) . (18) This reformulation has the advantage of allowing us to stick to our view of exact inference (with exact likelihood) with approximate priors. Indeed, under this model the conditional distribution of f given u is identical to that of the SoR, given in the left of (14). A systematic name for this approximation is the Deterministic Training Conditional (DTC). The fundamental difference with SoR is that DTC uses the exact test conditional (9b) instead of the deterministic relation between f∗ and u of SoR. The joint prior implied by DTC is given by: qDTC (f, f∗ ) = N 0, Qf,f Qf,∗ Q∗,f K∗,∗ , (19) which is surprisingly similar to the effective prior implied by the SoR approximation (15). The fundamental difference is that under the DTC approximation f∗ has a prior variance of its own, given by K∗,∗ . This prior variance reverses the behaviour of the predictive uncertainties, and turns them into sensible ones, see Figure 5 for an illustration. The predictive distribution is now given by: qDTC (f∗ |y) = N (Q∗,f (Qf,f + σ2 I)−1 y, K∗,∗ − Q∗,f (Qf,f + σ2 I)−1 Qf,∗ noise noise = N σ K∗,u Σ Ku,f y, K∗,∗ − Q∗,∗ + K∗,u ΣK∗,u , −2 (20a) (20b) where again we have deﬁned Σ = (σ−2 Ku,f Kf,u + Ku,u )−1 as in (16). The predictive mean for the DTC is identical to that of the SoR approximation (16), but the predictive variance replaces the Q∗,∗ from SoR with K∗,∗ (which is larger, since K∗,∗ − Q∗,∗ is positive deﬁnite). This added term is the predictive variance of the posterior of f∗ conditioned on u. It grows to the prior variance K∗,∗ as x∗ moves far from the inducing inputs in Xu . 1945 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN u    e ¡   ¡ e  e    ¡  e   ¡  e   ¡   e ¡   r r r f1 f2 fn f∗ Figure 2: Graphical model for the FITC approximation. Compared to those in Figure 1, all edges between latent function values have been removed: the latent function values are conditionally fully independent given the inducing variables u. Although strictly speaking the SoR and DTC approximations could also be represented by this graph, note that both further assume a deterministic relation between f and u. Remark 5 The only difference between the predictive distribution of DTC and SoR is the variance. The predictive variance of DTC is never smaller than that of SoR. Note, that since the covariances for training cases and test cases are computed differently, see (19), it follows that Remark 6 The DTC approximation does not correspond exactly to a Gaussian process, as the covariance between latent values depends on whether they are considered training or test cases, violating consistency, see Deﬁnition 1. The computational complexity has the same order as for SoR. 6. The Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) Approximation Recently Snelson and Ghahramani (2006) proposed another likelihood approximation to speed up Gaussian process regression, which they called Sparse Gaussian Processes using Pseudo-inputs (SGPP). While the DTC is based on the likelihood approximation given by (17), the SGPP proposes a more sophisticated likelihood approximation with a richer covariance p(y|f) −1 q(y|u) = N (Kf,u Ku,u u, diag[Kf,f − Qf,f ] + σ2 I) , noise (21) where diag[A] is a diagonal matrix whose elements match the diagonal of A. As we did in (18) for the DTC, we provide an alternative equivalent formulation called Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) based on the inducing conditionals: n qFITC (f|u) = ∏ p( fi |u) = N i=1 −1 Kf,u Ku,u u, diag[Kf,f −Qf,f ] , and qFITC ( f∗ |u) = p( f∗ |u) . (22) We see that as opposed to SoR and DTC, FITC does not impose a deterministic relation between f and u. Instead of ignoring the variance, FITC proposes an approximation to the training conditional distribution of f given u as a further independence assumption. In addition, the exact test conditional from (9b) is used in (22), although for reasons which will become clear towards the end of this 1946 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION section, we initially consider only a single test case, f∗ . The corresponding graphical model is given in Figure 2. The effective prior implied by the FITC is given by qFITC (f, f∗ ) = N 0, Qf,f − diag[Qf,f − Kf,f ] Qf,∗ Q∗,f K∗,∗ . (23) Note, that the sole difference between the DTC and FITC is that in the top left corner of the implied prior covariance, FITC replaces the approximate covariances of DTC by the exact ones on the diagonal. The predictive distribution is qFITC ( f∗ |y) = N Q∗,f (Qf,f + Λ)−1 y, K∗,∗ − Q∗,f (Qf,f + Λ)−1 Qf,∗ (24a) = N K∗,u ΣKu,f Λ−1 y, K∗,∗ − Q∗,∗ + K∗,u ΣKu,∗ , (24b) where we have deﬁned Σ = (Ku,u + Ku,f Λ−1 Kf,u )−1 and Λ = diag[Kf,f − Qf,f + σ2 I ]. The compunoise tational complexity is identical to that of SoR and DTC. So far we have only considered a single test case. There are two options for joint predictions, either 1) use the exact full test conditional from (9b), or 2) extend the additional factorizing assumption to the test conditional. Although Snelson and Ghahramani (2006) don’t explicitly discuss joint predictions, it would seem that they probably intend the second option. Whereas the additional independence assumption for the test cases is not really necessary for computational reasons, it does affect the nature of the approximation. Under option 1) the training and test covariance are computed differently, and thus this does not correspond to our strict deﬁnition of a GP model, but Remark 7 Iff the assumption of full independence is extended to the test conditional, the FITC approximation is equivalent to exact inference in a non-degenerate Gaussian process with covariance function kFIC (xi , x j ) = kSoR (xi , x j ) + δi, j [k(xi , x j ) − kSoR (xi , x j )], where δi, j is Kronecker’s delta. A logical name for the method where the conditionals (training and test) are always forced to be fully independent would be the Fully Independent Conditional (FIC) approximation. The effective prior implied by FIC is: qFIC (f, f∗ ) = N 0, Qf,f − diag[Qf,f − Kf,f ] Qf,∗ Q∗,f Q∗,∗ − diag[Q∗,∗ − K∗,∗ ] . (25) 7. The Partially Independent Training Conditional (PITC) Approximation In the previous section we saw how to improve the DTC approximation by approximating the training conditional with an independent distribution, i.e. one with a diagonal covariance matrix. In this section we will further improve the approximation (while remaining computationally attractive) by extending the training conditional to have a block diagonal covariance: −1 qPITC (f|u) = N Kf,u Ku,u u, blockdiag[Kf,f − Qf,f ] , and qPITC (f∗ |u) = p(f∗ |u) . (26) where blockdiag[A] is a block diagonal matrix (where the blocking structure is not explicitly stated). We represent graphically the PITC approximation in Figure 3. Developing this analogously to the FITC approximation from the previous section, we get the joint prior qPITC (f, f∗ ) = N 0, Qf,f − blockdiag[Qf,f − Kf,f ] Qf,∗ Q∗,f K∗,∗ 1947 , (27) ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN u    e ¡   ¡ e  e    ¡  e   ¡  e   ¡   e ¡   r r r fI fI fI f∗ 1 2 k Figure 3: Graphical representation of the PITC approximation. The set of latent function values fIi indexed by the the set of indices Ii is fully connected. The PITC differs from FITC (see graph in Fig. 2) in that conditional independence is now between the k groups of training latent function values. This corresponds to the block diagonal approximation to the true training conditional given in (26). and the predictive distribution is identical to (24), except for the alternative deﬁnition of Λ = blockdiag[Kf,f − Qf,f + σ2 I ]. An identical expression was obtained by Schwaighofer and Tresp noise (2003, Sect. 3), developing from the original Bayesian committee machine (BCM) by Tresp (2000). The relationship to the FITC was pointed out by Lehel Csat´ . The BCM was originally proposed as o a transductive learner (i.e. where the test inputs have to be known before training), and the inducing inputs Xu were chosen to be the test inputs. We discuss transduction in detail in the next section. It is important to realize that the BCM proposes two orthogonal ideas: ﬁrst, the block diagonal structure of the partially independent training conditional, and second setting the inducing inputs to be the test inputs. These two ideas can be used independently and in Section 8 we propose using the ﬁrst without the second. The computational complexity of the PITC approximation depends on the blocking structure imposed in (26). A reasonable choice, also recommended by Tresp (2000) may be to choose k = n/m blocks, each of size m × m. The computational complexity remains O (nm2 ). Since in the PITC model the covariance is computed differently for training and test cases Remark 8 The PITC approximation does not correspond exactly to a Gaussian process. This is because computing covariances requires knowing whether points are from the training- or test-set, (27). One can obtain a Gaussian process from the PITC by extending the partial conditional independence assumption to the test conditional, as we did in Remark 7 for the FITC. 8. Transduction and Augmentation The idea of transduction is that one should restrict the goal of learning to prediction on a prespeciﬁed set of test cases, rather than trying to learn an entire function (induction) and then evaluate it at the test inputs. There may be no universally agreed upon deﬁnition of transduction. In this paper we use Deﬁnition 9 Transduction occurs only if the predictive distribution depends on other test inputs. This operational deﬁnition excludes models for which there exist an equivalent inductive counterpart. According to this deﬁnition, it is irrelevant when the bulk of the computation takes place. 1948 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION u f∗   e  ¡     ¡ e   e ¡     ¡     e e   ¡       e ¡   r r r fI fI fI 1 2 k Figure 4: Two views on Augmentation. One view is to see that the test latent function value f∗ is now part of the inducing variables u and therefore has access to the training latent function values. An equivalent view is to consider that we have dropped the assumption of conditional independence between f∗ and the training latent function values. Even if f∗ has now direct access to each of the training fi , these still need to go through u to talk to each other if they fall in conditionally independent blocks. We have in this ﬁgure decided to recycle the graph for PITC from Figure 3 to show that all approximations we have presented can be augmented, irrespective of what the approximation for the training conditional is. There are several different possible motivations for transduction: 1) transduction is somehow easier than induction (Vapnik, 1995), 2) the test inputs may reveal important information, which should be used during training. This motivation drives models in semi-supervised learning (studied mostly in the context of classiﬁcation) and 3) for approximate algorithms one may be able to limit the discrepancies of the approximation at the test points. For exact GP models it seems that the ﬁrst reason doesn’t really apply. If you make predictions at the test points that are consistent with a GP, then it is trivial inside the GP framework to extend these to any other input points, and in effect we have done induction. The second reason seems more interesting. However, in a standard GP setting, it is a consequence of the consistency property, see Remark 2, that predictions at one test input are independent of the location of any other test inputs. Therefore transduction can not be married with exact GPs: Remark 10 Transduction can not occur in exact Gaussian process models. Whereas this holds for the usual setting of GPs, it could be different in non-standard situations where e.g. the covariance function depends on the empirical input densities. Transduction can occur in the sparse approximation to GPs, by making the choice of inducing variables depend on the test inputs. The BCM from the previous section, where Xu = X∗ (where X∗ are the test inputs) is an example of this. Since the inducing variables are connected to all other nodes (see Figure 3) we would expect the approximation to be good at u = f∗ , which is what we care about for predictions, relating to reason 3) above. While this reasoning is sound, it is not necessarily a sufﬁcient consideration for getting a good model. The model has to be able to simultaneously explain the training targets as well and if the choice of u makes this difﬁcult, the posterior at the points of interest may be distorted. Thus, the choice of u should be governed by the ability to model the conditional of the latents given the inputs, and not solely by the density of the (test) inputs. The main drawback of transduction is that by its nature it doesn’t provide a predictive model in the way inductive models do. In the usual GP model one can do the bulk of the computation 1949 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN involved in the predictive distributions (e.g. matrix inversion) before seeing the test cases, enabling fast computation of test predictions. It is interesting that whereas other methods spend much effort trying to optimize the inducing variables, the BCM simply uses the test set. The quality of the BCM approximation depends then on the particular location of the test inputs, upon which one usually does not have any control. We now see that there may be a better method, eliminating the drawback of transduction, namely use the PITC approximation, but choose the u’s carefully (see Section 9), don’t just use the test set. 8.1 Augmentation An idea closely related to transduction, but not covered by our deﬁnition, is augmentation, which in contrast to transduction is done individually for each test case. Since in the previous sections, we haven’t assumed anything about u, we can simply augment the set of inducing variables by f∗ (i.e. have one additional inducing variable equal to the current test latent), and see what happens in the predictive distributions for the different methods. Let’s ﬁrst investigate the consequences for the test conditional from (9b). Note, the interpretation of the covariance matrix K∗,∗ − Q∗,∗ was “the prior covariance minus the information which u provides about f∗ ”. It is clear that the augmented u (with f∗ ) provides all possible information about f∗ , and consequently Q∗,∗ = K∗,∗ . An equivalent view on augmentation is that the assumption of conditional independence between f∗ and f is dropped. This is seen trivially by adding edges between f∗ and the fi in the graphical model, Figure 4. Augmentation was originally proposed by Rasmussen (2002), and applied in detail to the SoR with RBF covariance by Qui˜ onero-Candela (2004). Because the SoR is a ﬁnite linear model, and n the basis functions are local (Gaussian bumps), the predictive distributions can be very misleading. For example, when making predictions far away from the center of any basis function, all basis functions have insigniﬁcant magnitudes, and the prediction (averaged over the posterior) will be close to zero, with very small error-bars; this is the opposite of the desired behaviour, where we would expect the error-bars to grow as we move away from the training cases. Here augmentation makes a particularly big difference turning the nonsensical predictive distribution into a reasonable one, by ensuring that there is always a basis function centered on the test case. Compare the nonaugmented to the augmented SoR in Figure 5. An analogous Gaussian process based ﬁnite linear model that has recently been healed by augmentation is the relevance vector machine (Rasmussen and Qui˜ onero-Candela, 2005). n Although augmentation was initially proposed for a narrow set of circumstances, it is easily applied to any of the approximations discussed. Of course, augmentation doesn’t make any sense for an exact, non-degenerate Gaussian process model (a GP with a covariance function that has a feature-space which is inﬁnite dimensional, i.e. with basis functions everywhere). Remark 11 A full non-degenerate Gaussian process cannot be augmented, since the corresponding f∗ would already be connected to all other variables in the graphical model. But augmentation does make sense for sparse approximations to GPs. The more general process view on augmentation has several advantages over the basis function view. It is not completely clear from the basis function view, which basis function should be used for augmentation. For example, Rasmussen and Qui˜ onero-Candela (2005) successfully apply augn mentation using basis functions that have a zero contribution at the test location! In the process view 1950 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION however, it seems clear that one would chose the additional inducing variable to be f∗ , to minimize the effects of the approximations. Let us compute the effective prior for the augmented SoR. Given that f∗ is in the inducing set, the test conditional is not an approximation and we can rewrite the integral leading to the effective prior: Z qASoR (f∗ , f) = qSoR (f| f∗ , u) p( f∗ , u) du . (28) It is interesting to notice that this is also the effective prior that would result from augmenting the DTC approximation, since qSoR (f| f∗ , u) = qDTC (f| f∗ , u). Remark 12 Augmented SoR (ASoR) is equivalent to augmented DTC (ADTC). Augmented DTC only differs from DTC in the additional presence of f∗ among the inducing variables in the training conditional. We can only expect augmented DTC to be a more accurate approximation than DTC, since adding an additional inducing variable can only help capture information from y. Therefore Remark 13 DTC is a less accurate (but cheaper) approximation than augmented SoR. We saw previously in Section 5 that the DTC approximation does not suffer from the nonsensical predictive variances of the SoR. The equivalence between the augmented SoR and augmented DTC is another way of seeing how augmentation reverses the misbehaviour of SoR. The predictive distribution of the augmented SoR is obtained by adding f∗ to u in (20). Prediction with an augmented sparse model comes at a higher computational cost, since now f∗ directly interacts with all of f and not just with u. For each new test case, updating the augmented Σ in the predictive equation (for example (20b) for DTC) implies computing the vector matrix product K∗,f Kf,u with complexity O (nm). This is clearly higher than the O (m) for the mean, and O (m2 ) for the predictive distribution of all the non-augmented methods we have discussed. Augmentation seems to be only really necessary for methods that make a severe approximation to the test conditional, like the SoR. For methods that make little or no approximation to the test conditional, it is difﬁcult to predict the degree to which augmentation would help. However, one can see by giving f∗ access to all of the training latent function values in f, one would expect augmentation to give less under-conﬁdent predictive distributions near the training data. Figure 5 clearly shows that augmented DTC (equivalent to augmented SoR) has a superior predictive distribution (both mean and variance) than standard DTC. Note however that in the ﬁgure we have purposely chosen a too short lengthscale to enhance visualization. Quantitatively, this superiority was experimentally assessed by Qui˜ onero-Candela (2004, Table 3.1). Augmentation hasn’t been n compared to the more advanced approximations FITC and PITC, and the ﬁgure would change in the more realistic scenario where the inducing inputs and hyperparameters are learnt (Snelson and Ghahramani, 2006). Transductive methods like the BCM can be seen as joint augmentation, and one could potentially use it for any of the methods presented. It seems that the good performance of the BCM could essentially stem from augmentation, the presence of the other test inputs in the inducing set being probably of little beneﬁt. Joint augmentation might bring some computational advantage, but won’t change the scaling: note that augmenting m times at a cost of O (nm) apiece implies the same O (nm2 ) total cost as the jointly augmented BCM. 1951 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN SoD SoR 1.5 1.5 1 1 0.5 0.5 0 0 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −1 −1.5 −15 −10 −5 0 5 10 15 −1.5 −15 −10 −5 DTC 0 5 10 15 5 10 15 5 10 15 ASoR/ADTC 1.5 1.5 1 1 0.5 0.5 0 0 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −1 −1.5 −15 −10 −5 0 5 10 15 −1.5 −15 −10 −5 FITC 0 PITC 1.5 1.5 1 1 0.5 0.5 0 0 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −1 −1.5 −15 −10 −5 0 5 10 15 −1.5 −15 −10 −5 0 Figure 5: Toy example with identical covariance function and hyperparameters.

Augmented DTC (ADTC) is equivalent to augmented SoR (ASoR), see Remark 12. 1952 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION 9. On the Choice of the Inducing Variables We have until now assumed that the inducing inputs Xu were given. Traditionally, sparse models have very often been built upon a carefully chosen subset of the training inputs. This concept is probably best exempliﬁed in the popular support vector machine (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). In sparse Gaussian processes it has also been suggested to select the inducing inputs Xu from among the training inputs. Since this involves a prohibitive combinatorial optimization, greedy optimization approaches have been suggested using various selection criteria like online learning (Csat´ and o Opper, 2002), greedy posterior maximization (Smola and Bartlett, 2001), maximum information gain (Seeger et al., 2003), matching pursuit (Keerthi and Chu, 2006), and probably more. As discussed in the previous section, selecting the inducing inputs from among the test inputs has also been considered in transductive settings. Recently, Snelson and Ghahramani (2006) have proposed to relax the constraint that the inducing variables must be a subset of training/test cases, turning the discrete selection problem into one of continuous optimization. One may hope that ﬁnding a good solution is easier in the continuous than the discrete case, although ﬁnding the global optimum is intractable in both cases. And perhaps the less restrictive choice can lead to better performance in very sparse models. Which optimality criterion should be used to set the inducing inputs? Departing from a fully Bayesian treatment which would involve deﬁning priors on Xu , one could maximize the marginal likelihood (also called the evidence) with respect to Xu , an approach also followed by Snelson and Ghahramani (2006). Each of the approximate methods proposed involves a different effective prior, and hence its own particular effective marginal likelihood conditioned on the inducing inputs q(y|Xu ) = ZZ p(y|f) q(f|u) p(u|Xu )du df = Z p(y|f) q(f|Xu )df , (29) which of course is independent of the test conditional. We have in the above equation explicitly conditioned on the inducing inputs Xu . Using Gaussian identities, the effective marginal likelihood is very easily obtained by adding a ridge σ2 I (from the likelihood) to the covariance of effective noise prior on f. Using the appropriate deﬁnitions of Λ, the log marginal likelihood becomes 1 log q(y|Xu ) = − 2 log |Qf,f + Λ| − 1 y (Qf,f + Λ)−1 y − n log(2π) , 2 2 (30) where ΛSoR = ΛDTC = σ2 I, ΛFITC = diag[Kf,f − Qf,f ] + σ2 I, and ΛPITC = blockdiag[Kf,f − noise noise Qf,f ] + σ2 I. The computational cost of the marginal likelihood is O (nm2 ) for all methods, that of noise its gradient with respect to one element of Xu is O (nm). This of course implies that the complexity of computing the gradient wrt. to the whole of Xu is O (dnm2 ), where d is the dimension of the input space. It has been proposed to maximize the effective posterior instead of the effective marginal likelihood (Smola and Bartlett, 2001). However this is potentially dangerous and can lead to overﬁtting. Maximizing the whole evidence instead is sound and comes at an identical computational cost (for a deeper analysis see Qui˜ onero-Candela, 2004, Sect. 3.3.5 and Fig. 3.2). n The marginal likelihood has traditionally been used to learn the hyperparameters of GPs in the non fully Bayesian treatment (see for example Williams and Rasmussen, 1996). For the sparse approximations presented here, once you are learning Xu it is straightforward to allow for learning hyperparameters (of the covariance function) during the same optimization, and there is no need to interleave optimization of u with learning of the hyperparameters as it has been proposed for example by Seeger et al. (2003). 1953 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN 10. Other Methods In this section we brieﬂy mention two approximations which don’t ﬁt in our unifying scheme, since one doesn’t correspond to a proper probabilistic model, and the other one uses a particular construction for the covariance function, rather than allowing any general covariance function. 10.1 The Nystr¨ m Approximation o The Nystr¨ m Approximation for speeding up GP regression was originally proposed by Williams o and Seeger (2001), and then questioned by Williams et al. (2002). Like SoR and DTC, the Nystr¨ m o Approximation for GP regression approximates the prior covariance of f by Qf,f . However, unlike these methods, the Nystr¨ m Approximation is not based on a generative probabilistic model. The o prior covariance between f∗ and f is taken to be exact, which is inconsistent with the prior covariance on f: Qf,f Kf,∗ . (31) q(f, f∗ ) = N 0, K∗,f K∗,∗ As a result we cannot derive this method from our unifying framework, nor represent it with a graphical model. Worse, the resulting prior covariance matrix is not even guaranteed to be positive deﬁnite, allowing the predictive variances to be negative. Notice that replacing Kf,∗ by Qf,∗ in (31) is enough to make the prior covariance positive deﬁnite, and one obtains the DTC approximation. Remark 14 The Nystr¨ m Approximation does not correspond to a well-formed probabilistic model. o Ignoring any quibbles about positive deﬁniteness, the predictive distribution of the Nystr¨ m Apo proximation is given by: p( f∗ |y) = N Kf,∗ [Qf,f + σ2 I]−1 y, K∗,∗ − Kf,∗ [Qf,f + σ2 I]−1 Kf,∗ , noise noise (32) but the predictive variance is not guaranteed to be positive. The computational cost is O (nm2 ). 10.2 The Relevance Vector Machine The relevance vector machine, introduced by Tipping (2001), is a ﬁnite linear model with an independent Gaussian prior imposed on the weights. For any input x∗ , the corresponding function output is given by: f∗ = φ∗ w , with p(w|A) = N (0, A) , (33) where φ∗ = [φ1 (x), . . . , φm (x)] is the (row) vector of responses of the m basis functions, and A = diag(α1 , . . . , αm ) is the diagonal matrix of joint prior precisions (inverse variances) of the weights. The αi are learnt by maximizing the RVM evidence (obtained by also assuming Gaussian additive iid. noise, see (1)), and for the typical case of rich enough sets of basis functions many of the precisions go to inﬁnity effectively pruning out the corresponding weights (for a very interesting analysis see Wipf et al., 2004). The RVM is thus a sparse method and the surviving basis functions are called relevance vectors. Note that since the RVM is a ﬁnite linear model with Gaussian priors on the weights, it can be seen as a Gaussian process: Remark 15 The RVM is equivalent to a degenerate Gaussian process with covariance function kRVM (xi , x j ) = φi A−1 φ j = ∑m α−1 φk (xi ) φk (x j ), k=1 k 1954 S PARSE A PPROXIMATE G AUSSIAN P ROCESS R EGRESSION q(f∗ |u) q(f|u) GP exact exact SoR determ. determ.

All these methods are detailed in the previous sections. The initial cost and that of the mean and variance per test case are respectively n2 , n and n2 for the exact GP, and nm2 , m and m2 for all other methods. The “GP?” column indicates whether the approximation is equivalent to a GP. For FITC see Remark 7. as was also pointed out by Tipping (2001, eq. (59)). Whereas all sparse approximations we have presented until now are totally independent of the choice of covariance function, for the RVM this choice is restricted to covariance functions that can be expressed as ﬁnite expansions in terms of some basis functions. Being degenerate GPs in exactly the same way as the SoR (presented in Section 4), the RVM does also suffer from unreasonable predictive variances. Rasmussen and Qui˜ onero-Candela (2005) show that the predictive distributions of RVMs can also be healed by n augmentation, see Section 8. Once the αi have been learnt, denoting by m the number of surviving relevance vectors, the complexity of computing the predictive distribution of the RVM is O (m) for mean and O (m2 ) for the variance. RVMs are often used with radial basis functions centered on the training inputs. One potentially interesting extension to the RVM would be to learn the locations of the centers of the basis functions, in the same way as proposed by Snelson and Ghahramani (2006) for the FITC approximation, see Section 6. This is a curious reminiscence of learning the centers in RBF Networks. 11. Conclusions We have provided a unifying framework for sparse approximations to Gaussian processes for regression. Our approach consists of two steps, ﬁrst 1) we recast the approximation in terms of approximations to the prior, and second 2) we introduce inducing variables u and the idea of conditional independence given u. We recover all existing sparse methods by making further simpliﬁcations of the covariances of the training and test conditionals, see Table 1 for a summary. Previous methods were presented based on different approximation paradigms (e.g. likelihood approximations, projection methods, matrix approximations, minimization of Kullback-Leibler divergence, etc), making direct comparison difﬁcult. Under our unifying view we deconstruct methods, making it clear which building blocks they are based upon. For example, the SGPP by Snelson 1955 ˜ Q UI NONERO -C ANDELA AND R ASMUSSEN and Ghahramani (2006) contains two ideas, 1) a likelihood approximation and 2) the idea of varying the inducing inputs continuously; these two ideas could easily be used independently, and incorporated in other methods. Similarly, the BCM by Tresp (2000) contains two independent ideas 1) a block diagonal assumption, and 2) the (transductive) idea of choosing the test inputs as the inducing variables. Finally we note that although all three ideas of 1) transductively setting u = f∗ , 2) augmentation and 3) continuous optimization of Xu have been proposed in very speciﬁc settings, in fact they are completely general ideas, which can be applied to any of the approximation schemes considered. We have ranked the approximation according to how close they are to the corresponding full GP. However, the performance in practical situations may not always follow this theoretical ranking since the approximations might exhibit properties (not present in the full GP) which may be particularly suitable for speciﬁc datasets. This may make the interpretation of empirical comparisons challenging. A further complication arises when adding the necessary heuristics for turning the theoretical constructs into practical algorithms. We have not described full algorithms in this paper, but are currently working on a detailed empirical study (in preparation, see also Rasmussen and Williams, 2006, chapter 8). We note that the order of the computational complexity is identical for all the methods considered, O (nm2 ). This highlights that there is no computational excuse for using gross approximations, such as assuming deterministic relationships, in particular one should probably think twice before using SoR or even DTC. Although augmentation has attractive predictive properties, it is computationally expensive. It remains unclear whether augmentation could be beneﬁcial on a ﬁxed computational budget. We have only considered the simpler case of regression in this paper, but sparseness is also commonly sought in classiﬁcation settings. It should not be difﬁcult to cast probabilistic approximation methods such as Expectation Propagation (EP) or the Laplace method (for a comparison, see Kuss and Rasmussen, 2005) into our unifying framework. Our analysis suggests that a new interesting approximation would come from combining the best possible approximation (PITC) with the most powerful selection method for the inducing inputs. This would correspond to a non-transductive version of the BCM. We would evade the necessity of knowing the test set before doing the bulk of the computation, and we could hope to supersede the superior performance reported by Snelson and Ghahramani (2006) for very sparse approximations.

<p>Author: Hyunsoo Kim, Peg Howland, Haesun Park</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) have been recognized as one of the most successful classiﬁcation methods for many applications including text classiﬁcation. Even though the learning ability and computational complexity of training in support vector machines may be independent of the dimension of the feature space, reducing computational complexity is an essential issue to efﬁciently handle a large number of terms in practical applications of text classiﬁcation. In this paper, we adopt novel dimension reduction methods to reduce the dimension of the document vectors dramatically. We also introduce decision functions for the centroid-based classiﬁcation algorithm and support vector classiﬁers to handle the classiﬁcation problem where a document may belong to multiple classes. Our substantial experimental results show that with several dimension reduction methods that are designed particularly for clustered data, higher efﬁciency for both training and testing can be achieved without sacriﬁcing prediction accuracy of text classiﬁcation even when the dimension of the input space is signiﬁcantly reduced.

<p>Author: Koji Tsuda, Gunnar Rätsch, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix. The central issue is to design parameter updates that preserve positive deﬁniteness. Our updates are motivated with the von Neumann divergence. Rather than treating the most general case, we focus on two key applications that exemplify our methods: on-line learning with a simple square loss, and ﬁnding a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix subject to linear constraints. The updates generalize the exponentiated gradient (EG) update and AdaBoost, respectively: the parameter is now a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix of trace one instead of a probability vector (which in this context is a diagonal positive definite matrix with trace one). The generalized updates use matrix logarithms and exponentials to preserve positive deﬁniteness. Most importantly, we show how the derivation and the analyses of the original EG update and AdaBoost generalize to the non-diagonal case. We apply the resulting matrix exponentiated gradient (MEG) update and DeﬁniteBoost to the problem of learning a kernel matrix from distance measurements.</p><p>6 0.11127225 <a title="60-lsi-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Concentration_Bounds_for_Unigram_Language_Models.html">22 jmlr-2005-Concentration Bounds for Unigram Language Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Leila Mohammadi, Sara van de Geer</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study a two-category classiﬁcation problem. We indicate the categories by labels Y = 1 and Y = −1. We observe a covariate, or feature, X ∈ X ⊂ Rd . Consider a collection {ha } of classiﬁers indexed by a ﬁnite-dimensional parameter a, and the classiﬁer ha∗ that minimizes the prediction error over this class. The parameter a∗ is estimated by the empirical risk minimizer an over the class, where the empirical risk is calculated on a training sample of size n. We apply ˆ the Kim Pollard Theorem to show that under certain differentiability assumptions, an converges to ˆ a∗ with rate n−1/3 , and also present the asymptotic distribution of the renormalized estimator. For example, let V0 denote the set of x on which, given X = x, the label Y = 1 is more likely (than the label Y = −1). If X is one-dimensional, the set V0 is the union of disjoint intervals. The problem is then to estimate the thresholds of the intervals. We obtain the asymptotic distribution of the empirical risk minimizer when the classiﬁers have K thresholds, where K is ﬁxed. We furthermore consider an extension to higher-dimensional X, assuming basically that V0 has a smooth boundary in some given parametric class. We also discuss various rates of convergence when the differentiability conditions are possibly violated. Here, we again restrict ourselves to one-dimensional X. We show that the rate is n−1 in certain cases, and then also obtain the asymptotic distribution for the empirical prediction error.

<p>Author: Savina Andonova Jaeger</p><p>Abstract: A uniﬁed approach is taken for deriving new generalization data dependent bounds for several classes of algorithms explored in the existing literature by different approaches. This uniﬁed approach is based on an extension of Vapnik’s inequality for VC classes of sets to random classes of sets - that is, classes depending on the random data, invariant under permutation of the data and possessing the increasing property. Generalization bounds are derived for convex combinations of functions from random classes with certain properties. Algorithms, such as SVMs (support vector machines), boosting with decision stumps, radial basis function networks, some hierarchies of kernel machines or convex combinations of indicator functions over sets with ﬁnite VC dimension, generate classiﬁer functions that fall into the above category. We also explore the individual complexities of the classiﬁers, such as sparsity of weights and weighted variance over clusters from the convex combination introduced by Koltchinskii and Panchenko (2004), and show sparsity-type and cluster-variance-type generalization bounds for random classes.

<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Nir Friedman</p><p>Abstract: A central challenge in learning probabilistic graphical models is dealing with domains that involve hidden variables. The common approach for learning model parameters in such domains is the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. This algorithm, however, can easily get trapped in suboptimal local maxima. Learning the model structure is even more challenging. The structural EM algorithm can adapt the structure in the presence of hidden variables, but usually performs poorly without prior knowledge about the cardinality and location of the hidden variables. In this work, we present a general approach for learning Bayesian networks with hidden variables that overcomes these problems. The approach builds on the information bottleneck framework of Tishby et al. (1999). We start by proving formal correspondence between the information bottleneck objective and the standard parametric EM functional. We then use this correspondence to construct a learning algorithm that combines an information-theoretic smoothing term with a continuation procedure. Intuitively, the algorithm bypasses local maxima and achieves superior solutions by following a continuous path from a solution of, an easy and smooth, target function, to a solution of the desired likelihood function. As we show, our algorithmic framework allows learning of the parameters as well as the structure of a network. In addition, it also allows us to introduce new hidden variables during model selection and learn their cardinality. We demonstrate the performance of our procedure on several challenging real-life data sets.

<p>Author: Petros Drineas, Michael W. Mahoney</p><p>Abstract: A problem for many kernel-based methods is that the amount of computation required to ﬁnd the solution scales as O(n3 ), where n is the number of training examples. We develop and analyze an algorithm to compute an easily-interpretable low-rank approximation to an n × n Gram matrix G such that computations of interest may be performed more rapidly. The approximation is of ˜ the form Gk = CWk+CT , where C is a matrix consisting of a small number c of columns of G and Wk is the best rank-k approximation to W , the matrix formed by the intersection between those c columns of G and the corresponding c rows of G. An important aspect of the algorithm is the probability distribution used to randomly sample the columns; we will use a judiciously-chosen and data-dependent nonuniform probability distribution. Let · 2 and · F denote the spectral norm and the Frobenius norm, respectively, of a matrix, and let Gk be the best rank-k approximation to G. We prove that by choosing O(k/ε4 ) columns G −CWk+CT ξ ≤ G − Gk ξ +ε n ∑ G2 , ii i=1 both in expectation and with high probability, for both ξ = 2, F, and for all k : 0 ≤ k ≤ rank(W ). This approximation can be computed using O(n) additional space and time, after making two passes over the data from external storage. The relationships between this algorithm, other related matrix decompositions, and the Nystr¨ m method from integral equation theory are discussed.1 o Keywords: kernel methods, randomized algorithms, Gram matrix, Nystr¨ m method o</p><p>5 0.82694763 <a title="60-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Generalization_Bounds_for_the_Area_Under_the_ROC_Curve.html">38 jmlr-2005-Generalization Bounds for the Area Under the ROC Curve</a></p>
<p>Author: Shivani Agarwal, Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Sariel Har-Peled, Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We study generalization properties of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), a quantity that has been advocated as an evaluation criterion for the bipartite ranking problem. The AUC is a different term than the error rate used for evaluation in classiﬁcation problems; consequently, existing generalization bounds for the classiﬁcation error rate cannot be used to draw conclusions about the AUC. In this paper, we deﬁne the expected accuracy of a ranking function (analogous to the expected error rate of a classiﬁcation function), and derive distribution-free probabilistic bounds on the deviation of the empirical AUC of a ranking function (observed on a ﬁnite data sequence) from its expected accuracy. We derive both a large deviation bound, which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on a test sequence, and a uniform convergence bound, which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a learned ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on a training sequence. Our uniform convergence bound is expressed in terms of a new set of combinatorial parameters that we term the bipartite rank-shatter coefﬁcients; these play the same role in our result as do the standard VC-dimension related shatter coefﬁcients (also known as the growth function) in uniform convergence results for the classiﬁcation error rate. A comparison of our result with a recent uniform convergence result derived by Freund et al. (2003) for a quantity closely related to the AUC shows that the bound provided by our result can be considerably tighter.

<p>Author: Ingo Steinwart, Don Hush, Clint Scovel</p><p>Abstract: One way to describe anomalies is by saying that anomalies are not concentrated. This leads to the problem of ﬁnding level sets for the data generating density. We interpret this learning problem as a binary classiﬁcation problem and compare the corresponding classiﬁcation risk with the standard performance measure for the density level problem. In particular it turns out that the empirical classiﬁcation risk can serve as an empirical performance measure for the anomaly detection problem. This allows us to compare different anomaly detection algorithms empirically, i.e. with the help of a test set. Furthermore, by the above interpretation we can give a strong justiﬁcation for the well-known heuristic of artiﬁcially sampling “labeled” samples, provided that the sampling plan is well chosen. In particular this enables us to propose a support vector machine (SVM) for anomaly detection for which we can easily establish universal consistency. Finally, we report some experiments which compare our SVM to other commonly used methods including the standard one-class SVM.

<p>Author: S. Sathiya Keerthi, Dennis DeCoste</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops a fast method for solving linear SVMs with L2 loss function that is suited for large scale data mining tasks such as text classiﬁcation. This is done by modifying the ﬁnite Newton method of Mangasarian in several ways. Experiments indicate that the method is much faster than decomposition methods such as SVMlight , SMO and BSVM (e.g., 4-100 fold), especially when the number of examples is large.

<p>Author: Fabio Aiolli, Alessandro Sperduti</p><p>Abstract: Winner-take-all multiclass classiﬁers are built on the top of a set of prototypes each representing one of the available classes. A pattern is then classiﬁed with the label associated to the most ‘similar’ prototype. Recent proposal of SVM extensions to multiclass can be considered instances of the same strategy with one prototype per class. The multi-prototype SVM proposed in this paper extends multiclass SVM to multiple prototypes per class. It allows to combine several vectors in a principled way to obtain large margin decision functions. For this problem, we give a compact constrained quadratic formulation and we propose a greedy optimization algorithm able to ﬁnd locally optimal solutions for the non convex objective function. This algorithm proceeds by reducing the overall problem into a series of simpler convex problems. For the solution of these reduced problems an efﬁcient optimization algorithm is proposed. A number of pattern selection strategies are then discussed to speed-up the optimization process. In addition, given the combinatorial nature of the overall problem, stochastic search strategies are suggested to escape from local minima which are not globally optimal. Finally, we report experiments on a number of datasets. The performance obtained using few simple linear prototypes is comparable to that obtained by state-of-the-art kernel-based methods but with a signiﬁcant reduction (of one or two orders) in response time.

<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for approximations to intractable probabilistic models which is based on a free energy formulation. The approximation can be understood as replacing an average over the original intractable distribution with a tractable one. It requires two tractable probability distributions which are made consistent on a set of moments and encode diﬀerent features of the original intractable distribution. In this way we are able to use Gaussian approximations for models with discrete or bounded variables which allow us to include non-trivial correlations. These are neglected in many other methods. We test the framework on toy benchmark problems for binary variables on fully connected graphs and 2D grids and compare with other methods, such as loopy belief propagation. Good performance is already achieved by using single nodes as tractable substructures. Signiﬁcant improvements are obtained when a spanning tree is used instead.</p><p>5 0.096537516 <a title="73-lsi-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Estimation_of_Non-Normalized_Statistical_Models_by_Score_Matching.html">31 jmlr-2005-Estimation of Non-Normalized Statistical Models by Score Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: One often wants to estimate statistical models where the probability density function is known only up to a multiplicative normalization constant. Typically, one then has to resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, or approximations of the normalization constant. Here, we propose that such models can be estimated by minimizing the expected squared distance between the gradient of the log-density given by the model and the gradient of the log-density of the observed data. While the estimation of the gradient of log-density function is, in principle, a very diﬃcult non-parametric problem, we prove a surprising result that gives a simple formula for this objective function. The density function of the observed data does not appear in this formula, which simpliﬁes to a sample average of a sum of some derivatives of the log-density given by the model. The validity of the method is demonstrated on multivariate Gaussian and independent component analysis models, and by estimating an overcomplete ﬁlter set for natural image data.

<p>Author: Ernesto De Vito, Lorenzo Rosasco, Andrea Caponnetto, Umberto De Giovannini, Francesca Odone</p><p>Abstract: Many works related learning from examples to regularization techniques for inverse problems, emphasizing the strong algorithmic and conceptual analogy of certain learning algorithms with regularization algorithms. In particular it is well known that regularization schemes such as Tikhonov regularization can be effectively used in the context of learning and are closely related to algorithms such as support vector machines. Nevertheless the connection with inverse problem was considered only for the discrete (ﬁnite sample) problem and the probabilistic aspects of learning from examples were not taken into account. In this paper we provide a natural extension of such analysis to the continuous (population) case and study the interplay between the discrete and continuous problems. From a theoretical point of view, this allows to draw a clear connection between the consistency approach in learning theory and the stability convergence property in ill-posed inverse problems. The main mathematical result of the paper is a new probabilistic bound for the regularized least-squares algorithm. By means of standard results on the approximation term, the consistency of the algorithm easily follows.

<p>Author: Shivani Agarwal, Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Sariel Har-Peled, Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We study generalization properties of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), a quantity that has been advocated as an evaluation criterion for the bipartite ranking problem. The AUC is a different term than the error rate used for evaluation in classiﬁcation problems; consequently, existing generalization bounds for the classiﬁcation error rate cannot be used to draw conclusions about the AUC. In this paper, we deﬁne the expected accuracy of a ranking function (analogous to the expected error rate of a classiﬁcation function), and derive distribution-free probabilistic bounds on the deviation of the empirical AUC of a ranking function (observed on a ﬁnite data sequence) from its expected accuracy. We derive both a large deviation bound, which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on a test sequence, and a uniform convergence bound, which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a learned ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on a training sequence. Our uniform convergence bound is expressed in terms of a new set of combinatorial parameters that we term the bipartite rank-shatter coefﬁcients; these play the same role in our result as do the standard VC-dimension related shatter coefﬁcients (also known as the growth function) in uniform convergence results for the classiﬁcation error rate. A comparison of our result with a recent uniform convergence result derived by Freund et al. (2003) for a quantity closely related to the AUC shows that the bound provided by our result can be considerably tighter.

<p>Author: Antoine Bordes, Seyda Ertekin, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou</p><p>Abstract: Very high dimensional learning systems become theoretically possible when training examples are abundant. The computing cost then becomes the limiting factor. Any efﬁcient learning algorithm should at least take a brief look at each example. But should all examples be given equal attention? This contribution proposes an empirical answer. We ﬁrst present an online SVM algorithm based on this premise. LASVM yields competitive misclassiﬁcation rates after a single pass over the training examples, outspeeding state-of-the-art SVM solvers. Then we show how active example selection can yield faster training, higher accuracies, and simpler models, using only a fraction of the training example labels.</p><p>5 0.17124215 <a title="73-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2005-A_Modified_Finite_Newton_Method_for_Fast_Solution_of_Large_Scale_Linear_SVMs.html">6 jmlr-2005-A Modified Finite Newton Method for Fast Solution of Large Scale Linear SVMs</a></p>
<p>Author: S. Sathiya Keerthi, Dennis DeCoste</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops a fast method for solving linear SVMs with L2 loss function that is suited for large scale data mining tasks such as text classiﬁcation. This is done by modifying the ﬁnite Newton method of Mangasarian in several ways. Experiments indicate that the method is much faster than decomposition methods such as SVMlight , SMO and BSVM (e.g., 4-100 fold), especially when the number of examples is large. The paper also suggests ways of extending the method to other loss functions such as the modiﬁed Huber’s loss function and the L1 loss function, and also for solving ordinal regression. Keywords: linear SVMs, classiﬁcation, conjugate gradient</p><p>6 0.16232605 <a title="73-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Core_Vector_Machines%3A_Fast_SVM_Training_on_Very_Large_Data_Sets.html">24 jmlr-2005-Core Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets</a></p>

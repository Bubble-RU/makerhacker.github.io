<p>Author: Damien  Ernst, Pierre  Geurts, Louis  Wehenkel</p><p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning aims to determine an optimal control policy from interaction with a system or from observations gathered from a system. In batch mode, it can be achieved by approximating the so-called Q-function based on a set of four-tuples (xt , ut , rt , xt+1 ) where xt denotes the system state at time t, ut the control action taken, rt the instantaneous reward obtained and xt+1 the successor state of the system, and by determining the control policy from this Q-function. The Q-function approximation may be obtained from the limit of a sequence of (batch mode) supervised learning problems. Within this framework we describe the use of several classical tree-based supervised learning methods (CART, Kd-tree, tree bagging) and two newly proposed ensemble algorithms, namely extremely and totally randomized trees. We study their performances on several examples and ﬁnd that the ensemble methods based on regression trees perform well in extracting relevant information about the optimal control policy from sets of four-tuples. In particular, the totally randomized trees give good results while ensuring the convergence of the sequence, whereas by relaxing the convergence constraint even better accuracy results are provided by the extremely randomized trees.

<p>Author: Guy Shani, David Heckerman, Ronen I. Brafman</p><p>Abstract: Typical recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation process and treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential optimization problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a more appropriate model for recommender systems. MDPs introduce two beneﬁts: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation and the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an MDP-based recommender system must employ a strong initial model, must be solvable quickly, and should not consume too much memory. In this paper, we describe our particular MDP model, its initialization using a predictive model, the solution and update algorithm, and its actual performance on a commercial site. We also describe the particular predictive model we used which outperforms previous models. Our system is one of a small number of commercially deployed recommender systems. As far as we know, it is the ﬁrst to report experimental analysis conducted on a real commercial site. These results validate the commercial value of recommender systems, and in particular, of our MDP-based approach.

<p>Author: Peter Binev, Albert Cohen, Wolfgang Dahmen, Ronald DeVore, Vladimir Temlyakov</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the construction and analysis of a universal estimator for the regression problem in supervised learning. Universal means that the estimator does not depend on any a priori assumptions about the regression function to be estimated. The universal estimator studied in this paper consists of a least-square ﬁtting procedure using piecewise constant functions on a partition which depends adaptively on the data. The partition is generated by a splitting procedure which differs from those used in CART algorithms. It is proven that this estimator performs at the optimal convergence rate for a wide class of priors on the regression function. Namely, as will be made precise in the text, if the regression function is in any one of a certain class of approximation spaces (or smoothness spaces of order not exceeding one – a limitation resulting because the estimator uses piecewise constants) measured relative to the marginal measure, then the estimator converges to the regression function (in the least squares sense) with an optimal rate of convergence in terms of the number of samples. The estimator is also numerically feasible and can be implemented on-line.

<p>Author: Hal Daumé III, Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for tackling the supervised clustering problem, the generic problem encountered in tasks such as reference matching, coreference resolution, identity uncertainty and record linkage. Our clustering model is based on the Dirichlet process prior, which enables us to deﬁne distributions over the countably inﬁnite sets that naturally arise in this problem. We add supervision to our model by positing the existence of a set of unobserved random variables (we call these “reference types”) that are generic across all clusters. Inference in our framework, which requires integrating over inﬁnitely many parameters, is solved using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors. We present a simple—but general—parameterization of our model based on a Gaussian assumption. We evaluate this model on one artiﬁcial task and three real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Our results show that our model is able to outperform other models across a variety of tasks and performance metrics.

<p>Author: Juho Rousu, John Shawe-Taylor</p><p>Abstract: We present a sparse dynamic programming algorithm that, given two strings s and t, a gap penalty λ, and an integer p, computes the value of the gap-weighted length-p subsequences kernel. The algorithm works in time O(p|M| log |t|), where M = {(i, j)|si = t j } is the set of matches of characters in the two sequences. The algorithm is easily adapted to handle bounded length subsequences and different gap-penalty schemes, including penalizing by the total length of gaps and the number of gaps as well as incorporating character-speciﬁc match/gap penalties. The new algorithm is empirically evaluated against a full dynamic programming approach and a trie-based algorithm both on synthetic and newswire article data. Based on the experiments, the full dynamic programming approach is the fastest on short strings, and on long strings if the alphabet is small. On large alphabets, the new sparse dynamic programming algorithm is the most efﬁcient. On medium-sized alphabets the trie-based approach is best if the maximum number of allowed gaps is strongly restricted.

<p>Author: David Wingate, Kevin D. Seppi</p><p>Abstract: The performance of value and policy iteration can be dramatically improved by eliminating redundant or useless backups, and by backing up states in the right order. We study several methods designed to accelerate these iterative solvers, including prioritization, partitioning, and variable reordering. We generate a family of algorithms by combining several of the methods discussed, and present extensive empirical evidence demonstrating that performance can improve by several orders of magnitude for many problems, while preserving accuracy and convergence guarantees.

<p>Author: Damien  Ernst, Pierre  Geurts, Louis  Wehenkel</p><p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning aims to determine an optimal control policy from interaction with a system or from observations gathered from a system. In batch mode, it can be achieved by approximating the so-called Q-function based on a set of four-tuples (xt , ut , rt , xt+1 ) where xt denotes the system state at time t, ut the control action taken, rt the instantaneous reward obtained and xt+1 the successor state of the system, and by determining the control policy from this Q-function. The Q-function approximation may be obtained from the limit of a sequence of (batch mode) supervised learning problems. Within this framework we describe the use of several classical tree-based supervised learning methods (CART, Kd-tree, tree bagging) and two newly proposed ensemble algorithms, namely extremely and totally randomized trees. We study their performances on several examples and ﬁnd that the ensemble methods based on regression trees perform well in extracting relevant information about the optimal control policy from sets of four-tuples. In particular, the totally randomized trees give good results while ensuring the convergence of the sequence, whereas by relaxing the convergence constraint even better accuracy results are provided by the extremely randomized trees.

<p>Author: Gunnar Rätsch, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: AdaBoost produces a linear combination of base hypotheses and predicts with the sign of this linear combination. The linear combination may be viewed as a hyperplane in feature space where the base hypotheses form the features. It has been observed that the generalization error of the algorithm continues to improve even after all examples are on the correct side of the current hyperplane. The improvement is attributed to the experimental observation that the distances (margins) of the examples to the separating hyperplane are increasing even after all examples are on the correct side. We introduce a new version of AdaBoost, called AdaBoost∗ , that explicitly maximizes the ν minimum margin of the examples up to a given precision. The algorithm incorporates a current estimate of the achievable margin into its calculation of the linear coefﬁcients of the base hypotheses. The bound on the number of iterations needed by the new algorithms is the same as the number needed by a known version of AdaBoost that must have an explicit estimate of the achievable margin as a parameter. We also illustrate experimentally that our algorithm requires considerably fewer iterations than other algorithms that aim to maximize the margin.</p><p>5 0.29072714 <a title="61-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Working_Set_Selection_Using_Second_Order_Information_for_Training_Support_Vector_Machines.html">73 jmlr-2005-Working Set Selection Using Second Order Information for Training Support Vector Machines</a></p>

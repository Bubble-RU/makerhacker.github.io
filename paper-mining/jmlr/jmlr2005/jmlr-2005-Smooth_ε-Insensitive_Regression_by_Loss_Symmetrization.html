<p>Author: Koji Tsuda, Gunnar Rätsch, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix. The central issue is to design parameter updates that preserve positive deﬁniteness. Our updates are motivated with the von Neumann divergence. Rather than treating the most general case, we focus on two key applications that exemplify our methods: on-line learning with a simple square loss, and ﬁnding a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix subject to linear constraints. The updates generalize the exponentiated gradient (EG) update and AdaBoost, respectively: the parameter is now a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix of trace one instead of a probability vector (which in this context is a diagonal positive definite matrix with trace one). The generalized updates use matrix logarithms and exponentials to preserve positive deﬁniteness. Most importantly, we show how the derivation and the analyses of the original EG update and AdaBoost generalize to the non-diagonal case. We apply the resulting matrix exponentiated gradient (MEG) update and DeﬁniteBoost to the problem of learning a kernel matrix from distance measurements.</p><p>3 0.087534577 <a title="66-tfidf-3" href="./jmlr-2005-Large_Margin_Methods_for_Structured_and_Interdependent_Output_Variables.html">42 jmlr-2005-Large Margin Methods for Structured and Interdependent Output Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Tsochantaridis, Thorsten Joachims, Thomas Hofmann, Yasemin Altun</p><p>Abstract: Learning general functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output spaces is one of the key challenges in computational intelligence. While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing ﬂexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classiﬁcation algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classiﬁcation problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.</p><p>4 0.076394334 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2005-Adaptive_Online_Prediction_by_Following_the_Perturbed_Leader.html">10 jmlr-2005-Adaptive Online Prediction by Following the Perturbed Leader</a></p>
<p>Author: Marcus Hutter, Jan Poland</p><p>Abstract: When applying aggregating strategies to Prediction with Expert Advice (PEA), the learning rate √ must be adaptively tuned. The natural choice of complexity/current loss renders the analysis of Weighted Majority (WM) derivatives quite complicated. In particular, for arbitrary weights there have been no results proven so far. The analysis of the alternative Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL) algorithm from Kalai and Vempala (2003) based on Hannan’s algorithm is easier. We derive loss bounds for adaptive learning rate and both ﬁnite expert classes with uniform weights and countable expert classes with arbitrary weights.

<p>Author: Günther Eibl, Karl-Peter Pfeiffer</p><p>Abstract: AdaBoost.M2 is a boosting algorithm designed for multiclass problems with weak base classiﬁers. The algorithm is designed to minimize a very loose bound on the training error. We propose two alternative boosting algorithms which also minimize bounds on performance measures. These performance measures are not as strongly connected to the expected error as the training error, but the derived bounds are tighter than the bound on the training error of AdaBoost.M2. In experiments the methods have roughly the same performance in minimizing the training and test error rates. The new algorithms have the advantage that the base classiﬁer should minimize the conﬁdence-rated error, whereas for AdaBoost.M2 the base classiﬁer should minimize the pseudo-loss. This makes them more easily applicable to already existing base classiﬁers. The new algorithms also tend to converge faster than AdaBoost.M2.

Our regression framework also has implications on classiﬁcation algorithms, namely, a new additive update boosting algorithm for classiﬁcation. We demonstrate the merits of our algorithms in a series of experiments.</p><p>2 0.33141616 <a title="66-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2005-Large_Margin_Methods_for_Structured_and_Interdependent_Output_Variables.html">42 jmlr-2005-Large Margin Methods for Structured and Interdependent Output Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Tsochantaridis, Thorsten Joachims, Thomas Hofmann, Yasemin Altun</p><p>Abstract: Learning general functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output spaces is one of the key challenges in computational intelligence. While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing ﬂexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classiﬁcation algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classiﬁcation problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.</p><p>3 0.33116943 <a title="66-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2005-An_MDP-Based_Recommender_System.html">12 jmlr-2005-An MDP-Based Recommender System</a></p>
<p>Author: Guy Shani, David Heckerman, Ronen I. Brafman</p><p>Abstract: Typical recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation process and treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential optimization problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a more appropriate model for recommender systems. MDPs introduce two beneﬁts: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation and the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an MDP-based recommender system must employ a strong initial model, must be solvable quickly, and should not consume too much memory. In this paper, we describe our particular MDP model, its initialization using a predictive model, the solution and update algorithm, and its actual performance on a commercial site. We also describe the particular predictive model we used which outperforms previous models. Our system is one of a small number of commercially deployed recommender systems. As far as we know, it is the ﬁrst to report experimental analysis conducted on a real commercial site. These results validate the commercial value of recommender systems, and in particular, of our MDP-based approach.

<p>Author: Dmitry Rusakov, Dan Geiger</p><p>Abstract: We develop a closed form asymptotic formula to compute the marginal likelihood of data given a naive Bayesian network model with two hidden states and binary features. This formula deviates from the standard BIC score. Our work provides a concrete example that the BIC score is generally incorrect for statistical models that belong to stratiﬁed exponential families. This claim stands in contrast to linear and curved exponential families, where the BIC score has been proven to provide a correct asymptotic approximation for the marginal likelihood.

<p>Author: Aharon Bar-Hillel, Tomer Hertz, Noam Shental, Daphna Weinshall</p><p>Abstract: Many learning algorithms use a metric deﬁned over the input space as a principal tool, and their performance critically depends on the quality of this metric. We address the problem of learning metrics using side-information in the form of equivalence constraints. Unlike labels, we demonstrate that this type of side-information can sometimes be automatically obtained without the need of human intervention. We show how such side-information can be used to modify the representation of the data, leading to improved clustering and classiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, we present the Relevant Component Analysis (RCA) algorithm, which is a simple and efﬁcient algorithm for learning a Mahalanobis metric. We show that RCA is the solution of an interesting optimization problem, founded on an information theoretic basis. If dimensionality reduction is allowed within RCA, we show that it is optimally accomplished by a version of Fisher’s linear discriminant that uses constraints. Moreover, under certain Gaussian assumptions, RCA can be viewed as a Maximum Likelihood estimation of the within class covariance matrix. We conclude with extensive empirical evaluations of RCA, showing its advantage over alternative methods. Keywords: clustering, metric learning, dimensionality reduction, equivalence constraints, side information.</p><p>6 0.32360554 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Information_Bottleneck_for_Gaussian_Variables.html">39 jmlr-2005-Information Bottleneck for Gaussian Variables</a></p>

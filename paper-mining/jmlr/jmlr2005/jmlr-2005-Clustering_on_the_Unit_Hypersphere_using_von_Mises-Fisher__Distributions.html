<h1>19 jmlr-2005-Clustering on the Unit Hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher  Distributions</h1>

Dhillon, Joydeep Ghosh, Suvrit Sra</p><p>Abstract: Several large scale data mining applications, such as text categorization and gene expression analysis, involve high-dimensional data that is also inherently directional in nature. Often such data is L2 normalized so that it lies on the surface of a unit hypersphere. Popular models such as (mixtures of) multi-variate Gaussians are inadequate for characterizing such data. This paper proposes a generative mixture-model approach to clustering directional data based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, which arises naturally for data distributed on the unit hypersphere. In particular, we derive and analyze two variants of the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework for estimating the mean and concentration parameters of this mixture. Numerical estimation of the concentration parameters is non-trivial in high dimensions since it involves functional inversion of ratios of Bessel functions. We also formulate two clustering algorithms corresponding to the variants of EM that we derive. Our approach provides a theoretical basis for the use of cosine similarity that has been widely employed by the information retrieval community, and obtains the spherical kmeans algorithm (kmeans with cosine similarity) as a special case of both variants. Empirical results on clustering of high-dimensional text and gene-expression data based on a mixture of vMF distributions show that the ability to estimate the concentration parameter for each vMF component, which is not present in existing approaches, yields superior results, especially for difﬁcult clustering tasks in high-dimensional spaces.

<p>Author: Hal Daumé III, Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for tackling the supervised clustering problem, the generic problem encountered in tasks such as reference matching, coreference resolution, identity uncertainty and record linkage. Our clustering model is based on the Dirichlet process prior, which enables us to deﬁne distributions over the countably inﬁnite sets that naturally arise in this problem. We add supervision to our model by positing the existence of a set of unobserved random variables (we call these “reference types”) that are generic across all clusters. Inference in our framework, which requires integrating over inﬁnitely many parameters, is solved using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors. We present a simple—but general—parameterization of our model based on a Gaussian assumption. We evaluate this model on one artiﬁcial task and three real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Our results show that our model is able to outperform other models across a variety of tasks and performance metrics.

<p>Author: Arindam Banerjee, Srujana Merugu, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Joydeep Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: A wide variety of distortion functions, such as squared Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, Itakura-Saito distance and relative entropy, have been used for clustering. In this paper, we propose and analyze parametric hard and soft clustering algorithms based on a large class of distortion functions known as Bregman divergences. The proposed algorithms unify centroid-based parametric clustering approaches, such as classical kmeans, the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm and information-theoretic clustering, which arise by special choices of the Bregman divergence. The algorithms maintain the simplicity and scalability of the classical kmeans algorithm, while generalizing the method to a large class of clustering loss functions. This is achieved by ﬁrst posing the hard clustering problem in terms of minimizing the loss in Bregman information, a quantity motivated by rate distortion theory, and then deriving an iterative algorithm that monotonically decreases this loss. In addition, we show that there is a bijection between regular exponential families and a large class of Bregman divergences, that we call regular Bregman divergences. This result enables the development of an alternative interpretation of an efﬁcient EM scheme for learning mixtures of exponential family distributions, and leads to a simple soft clustering algorithm for regular Bregman divergences. Finally, we discuss the connection between rate distortion theory and Bregman clustering and present an information theoretic analysis of Bregman clustering algorithms in terms of a trade-off between compression and loss in Bregman information.

<p>Author: Hyunsoo Kim, Peg Howland, Haesun Park</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) have been recognized as one of the most successful classiﬁcation methods for many applications including text classiﬁcation. Even though the learning ability and computational complexity of training in support vector machines may be independent of the dimension of the feature space, reducing computational complexity is an essential issue to efﬁciently handle a large number of terms in practical applications of text classiﬁcation. In this paper, we adopt novel dimension reduction methods to reduce the dimension of the document vectors dramatically. We also introduce decision functions for the centroid-based classiﬁcation algorithm and support vector classiﬁers to handle the classiﬁcation problem where a document may belong to multiple classes. Our substantial experimental results show that with several dimension reduction methods that are designed particularly for clustered data, higher efﬁciency for both training and testing can be achieved without sacriﬁcing prediction accuracy of text classiﬁcation even when the dimension of the input space is signiﬁcantly reduced.

<p>Author: Lior Wolf, Amnon Shashua</p><p>Abstract: The problem of selecting a subset of relevant features in a potentially overwhelming quantity of data is classic and found in many branches of science. Examples in computer vision, text processing and more recently bio-informatics are abundant. In text classiﬁcation tasks, for example, it is not uncommon to have 104 to 107 features of the size of the vocabulary containing word frequency counts, with the expectation that only a small fraction of them are relevant. Typical examples include the automatic sorting of URLs into a web directory and the detection of spam email. In this work we present a deﬁnition of “relevancy” based on spectral properties of the Laplacian of the features’ measurement matrix. The feature selection process is then based on a continuous ranking of the features deﬁned by a least-squares optimization process. A remarkable property of the feature relevance function is that sparse solutions for the ranking values naturally emerge as a result of a “biased non-negativity” of a key matrix in the process. As a result, a simple leastsquares optimization process converges onto a sparse solution, i.e., a selection of a subset of features which form a local maximum over the relevance function. The feature selection algorithm can be embedded in both unsupervised and supervised inference problems and empirical evidence show that the feature selections typically achieve high accuracy even when only a small fraction of the features are relevant.</p><p>6 0.095103011 <a title="19-tfidf-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Local_Propagation_in_Conditional_Gaussian_Bayesian_Networks.html">51 jmlr-2005-Local Propagation in Conditional Gaussian Bayesian Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Arindam Banerjee, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Joydeep Ghosh, Suvrit Sra</p><p>Abstract: Several large scale data mining applications, such as text categorization and gene expression analysis, involve high-dimensional data that is also inherently directional in nature. Often such data is L2 normalized so that it lies on the surface of a unit hypersphere. Popular models such as (mixtures of) multi-variate Gaussians are inadequate for characterizing such data. This paper proposes a generative mixture-model approach to clustering directional data based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, which arises naturally for data distributed on the unit hypersphere. In particular, we derive and analyze two variants of the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework for estimating the mean and concentration parameters of this mixture. Numerical estimation of the concentration parameters is non-trivial in high dimensions since it involves functional inversion of ratios of Bessel functions. We also formulate two clustering algorithms corresponding to the variants of EM that we derive. Our approach provides a theoretical basis for the use of cosine similarity that has been widely employed by the information retrieval community, and obtains the spherical kmeans algorithm (kmeans with cosine similarity) as a special case of both variants. Empirical results on clustering of high-dimensional text and gene-expression data based on a mixture of vMF distributions show that the ability to estimate the concentration parameter for each vMF component, which is not present in existing approaches, yields superior results, especially for difﬁcult clustering tasks in high-dimensional spaces.

<p>Author: Arindam Banerjee, Srujana Merugu, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Joydeep Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: A wide variety of distortion functions, such as squared Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, Itakura-Saito distance and relative entropy, have been used for clustering. In this paper, we propose and analyze parametric hard and soft clustering algorithms based on a large class of distortion functions known as Bregman divergences. The proposed algorithms unify centroid-based parametric clustering approaches, such as classical kmeans, the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm and information-theoretic clustering, which arise by special choices of the Bregman divergence. The algorithms maintain the simplicity and scalability of the classical kmeans algorithm, while generalizing the method to a large class of clustering loss functions. This is achieved by ﬁrst posing the hard clustering problem in terms of minimizing the loss in Bregman information, a quantity motivated by rate distortion theory, and then deriving an iterative algorithm that monotonically decreases this loss. In addition, we show that there is a bijection between regular exponential families and a large class of Bregman divergences, that we call regular Bregman divergences. This result enables the development of an alternative interpretation of an efﬁcient EM scheme for learning mixtures of exponential family distributions, and leads to a simple soft clustering algorithm for regular Bregman divergences. Finally, we discuss the connection between rate distortion theory and Bregman clustering and present an information theoretic analysis of Bregman clustering algorithms in terms of a trade-off between compression and loss in Bregman information.

<p>Author: Hal Daumé III, Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for tackling the supervised clustering problem, the generic problem encountered in tasks such as reference matching, coreference resolution, identity uncertainty and record linkage. Our clustering model is based on the Dirichlet process prior, which enables us to deﬁne distributions over the countably inﬁnite sets that naturally arise in this problem. We add supervision to our model by positing the existence of a set of unobserved random variables (we call these “reference types”) that are generic across all clusters. Inference in our framework, which requires integrating over inﬁnitely many parameters, is solved using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors. We present a simple—but general—parameterization of our model based on a Gaussian assumption. We evaluate this model on one artiﬁcial task and three real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Our results show that our model is able to outperform other models across a variety of tasks and performance metrics.

<p>Author: Hyunsoo Kim, Peg Howland, Haesun Park</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) have been recognized as one of the most successful classiﬁcation methods for many applications including text classiﬁcation. Even though the learning ability and computational complexity of training in support vector machines may be independent of the dimension of the feature space, reducing computational complexity is an essential issue to efﬁciently handle a large number of terms in practical applications of text classiﬁcation. In this paper, we adopt novel dimension reduction methods to reduce the dimension of the document vectors dramatically. We also introduce decision functions for the centroid-based classiﬁcation algorithm and support vector classiﬁers to handle the classiﬁcation problem where a document may belong to multiple classes. Our substantial experimental results show that with several dimension reduction methods that are designed particularly for clustered data, higher efﬁciency for both training and testing can be achieved without sacriﬁcing prediction accuracy of text classiﬁcation even when the dimension of the input space is signiﬁcantly reduced.

<p>Author: Ioannis Tsochantaridis, Thorsten Joachims, Thomas Hofmann, Yasemin Altun</p><p>Abstract: Learning general functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output spaces is one of the key challenges in computational intelligence. While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing ﬂexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classiﬁcation algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classiﬁcation problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.</p><p>6 0.38564929 <a title="19-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Efficient_Margin_Maximizing_with_Boosting.html">29 jmlr-2005-Efficient Margin Maximizing with Boosting</a></p>

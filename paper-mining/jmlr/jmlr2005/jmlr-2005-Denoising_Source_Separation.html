<p>Author: Motoaki Kawanabe, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: A blind separation problem where the sources are not independent, but have variance dependencies is discussed. For this scenario Hyv¨ rinen and Hurri (2004) proposed an algorithm which requires a no assumption on distributions of sources and no parametric model of dependencies between components. In this paper, we extend the semiparametric approach of Amari and Cardoso (1997) to variance dependencies and study estimating functions for blind separation of such dependent sources. In particular, we show that many ICA algorithms are applicable to the variance-dependent model as well under mild conditions, although they should in principle not. Our results indicate that separation can be done based only on normalized sources which are adjusted to have stationary variances and is not affected by the dependent activity levels. We also study the asymptotic distribution of the quasi maximum likelihood method and the stability of the natural gradient learning in detail. Simulation results of artiﬁcial and realistic examples match well with our theoretical ﬁndings.

<p>Author: Luís B. Almeida</p><p>Abstract: When acquiring an image of a paper document, the image printed on the back page sometimes shows through. The mixture of the front- and back-page images thus obtained is markedly nonlinear, and thus constitutes a good real-life test case for nonlinear blind source separation. This paper addresses a difﬁcult version of this problem, corresponding to the use of “onion skin” paper, which results in a relatively strong nonlinearity of the mixture, which becomes close to singular in the lighter regions of the images. The separation is achieved through the MISEP technique, which is an extension of the well known INFOMAX method. The separation results are assessed with objective quality measures. They show an improvement over the results obtained with linear separation, but have room for further improvement.

<p>Author: Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: One often wants to estimate statistical models where the probability density function is known only up to a multiplicative normalization constant. Typically, one then has to resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, or approximations of the normalization constant. Here, we propose that such models can be estimated by minimizing the expected squared distance between the gradient of the log-density given by the model and the gradient of the log-density of the observed data. While the estimation of the gradient of log-density function is, in principle, a very diﬃcult non-parametric problem, we prove a surprising result that gives a simple formula for this objective function. The density function of the observed data does not appear in this formula, which simpliﬁes to a sample average of a sum of some derivatives of the log-density given by the model. The validity of the method is demonstrated on multivariate Gaussian and independent component analysis models, and by estimating an overcomplete ﬁlter set for natural image data.

<p>Author: Arthur Gretton, Ralf Herbrich, Alexander Smola, Olivier Bousquet, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We introduce two new functionals, the constrained covariance and the kernel mutual information, to measure the degree of independence of random variables. These quantities are both based on the covariance between functions of the random variables in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). We prove that when the RKHSs are universal, both functionals are zero if and only if the random variables are pairwise independent. We also show that the kernel mutual information is an upper bound near independence on the Parzen window estimate of the mutual information. Analogous results apply for two correlation-based dependence functionals introduced earlier: we show the kernel canonical correlation and the kernel generalised variance to be independence measures for universal kernels, and prove the latter to be an upper bound on the mutual information near independence. The performance of the kernel dependence functionals in measuring independence is veriﬁed in the context of independent component analysis.

<p>Author: Ingo Steinwart, Don Hush, Clint Scovel</p><p>Abstract: One way to describe anomalies is by saying that anomalies are not concentrated. This leads to the problem of ﬁnding level sets for the data generating density. We interpret this learning problem as a binary classiﬁcation problem and compare the corresponding classiﬁcation risk with the standard performance measure for the density level problem. In particular it turns out that the empirical classiﬁcation risk can serve as an empirical performance measure for the anomaly detection problem. This allows us to compare different anomaly detection algorithms empirically, i.e. with the help of a test set. Furthermore, by the above interpretation we can give a strong justiﬁcation for the well-known heuristic of artiﬁcially sampling “labeled” samples, provided that the sampling plan is well chosen. In particular this enables us to propose a support vector machine (SVM) for anomaly detection for which we can easily establish universal consistency. Finally, we report some experiments which compare our SVM to other commonly used methods including the standard one-class SVM.

<p>Author: Peter Binev, Albert Cohen, Wolfgang Dahmen, Ronald DeVore, Vladimir Temlyakov</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the construction and analysis of a universal estimator for the regression problem in supervised learning. Universal means that the estimator does not depend on any a priori assumptions about the regression function to be estimated. The universal estimator studied in this paper consists of a least-square ﬁtting procedure using piecewise constant functions on a partition which depends adaptively on the data. The partition is generated by a splitting procedure which differs from those used in CART algorithms. It is proven that this estimator performs at the optimal convergence rate for a wide class of priors on the regression function. Namely, as will be made precise in the text, if the regression function is in any one of a certain class of approximation spaces (or smoothness spaces of order not exceeding one – a limitation resulting because the estimator uses piecewise constants) measured relative to the marginal measure, then the estimator converges to the regression function (in the least squares sense) with an optimal rate of convergence in terms of the number of samples. The estimator is also numerically feasible and can be implemented on-line.

<p>Author: Marc Boullé</p><p>Abstract: In supervised machine learning, the partitioning of the values (also called grouping) of a categorical attribute aims at constructing a new synthetic attribute which keeps the information of the initial attribute and reduces the number of its values. In this paper, we propose a new grouping method MODL1 founded on a Bayesian approach. The method relies on a model space of grouping models and on a prior distribution defined on this model space. This results in an evaluation criterion of grouping, which is minimal for the most probable grouping given the data, i.e. the Bayes optimal grouping. We propose new super-linear optimization heuristics that yields near-optimal groupings. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that the MODL grouping method builds high quality groupings in terms of predictive quality, robustness and small number of groups.

<p>Author: Jaakko Särelä, Harri Valpola</p><p>Abstract: A new algorithmic framework called denoising source separation (DSS) is introduced. The main beneﬁt of this framework is that it allows for the easy development of new source separation algorithms which can be optimised for speciﬁc problems. In this framework, source separation algorithms are constructed around denoising procedures. The resulting algorithms can range from almost blind to highly specialised source separation algorithms. Both simple linear and more complex nonlinear or adaptive denoising schemes are considered. Some existing independent component analysis algorithms are reinterpreted within the DSS framework and new, robust blind source separation algorithms are suggested. The framework is derived as a one-unit equivalent to an EM algorithm for source separation. However, in the DSS framework it is easy to utilise various kinds of denoising procedures which need not be based on generative models. In the experimental section, various DSS schemes are applied extensively to artiﬁcial data, to real magnetoencephalograms and to simulated CDMA mobile network signals. Finally, various extensions to the proposed DSS algorithms are considered. These include nonlinear observation mappings, hierarchical models and over-complete, nonorthogonal feature spaces. With these extensions, DSS appears to have relevance to many existing models of neural information processing.

<p>Author: Motoaki Kawanabe, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: A blind separation problem where the sources are not independent, but have variance dependencies is discussed. For this scenario Hyv¨ rinen and Hurri (2004) proposed an algorithm which requires a no assumption on distributions of sources and no parametric model of dependencies between components. In this paper, we extend the semiparametric approach of Amari and Cardoso (1997) to variance dependencies and study estimating functions for blind separation of such dependent sources. In particular, we show that many ICA algorithms are applicable to the variance-dependent model as well under mild conditions, although they should in principle not. Our results indicate that separation can be done based only on normalized sources which are adjusted to have stationary variances and is not affected by the dependent activity levels. We also study the asymptotic distribution of the quasi maximum likelihood method and the stability of the natural gradient learning in detail. Simulation results of artiﬁcial and realistic examples match well with our theoretical ﬁndings.

<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for approximations to intractable probabilistic models which is based on a free energy formulation. The approximation can be understood as replacing an average over the original intractable distribution with a tractable one. It requires two tractable probability distributions which are made consistent on a set of moments and encode diﬀerent features of the original intractable distribution. In this way we are able to use Gaussian approximations for models with discrete or bounded variables which allow us to include non-trivial correlations. These are neglected in many other methods. We test the framework on toy benchmark problems for binary variables on fully connected graphs and 2D grids and compare with other methods, such as loopy belief propagation. Good performance is already achieved by using single nodes as tractable substructures. Signiﬁcant improvements are obtained when a spanning tree is used instead.</p><p>5 0.29549968 <a title="25-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Separating_a_Real-Life_Nonlinear_Image_Mixture.html">65 jmlr-2005-Separating a Real-Life Nonlinear Image Mixture</a></p>
<p>Author: Luís B. Almeida</p><p>Abstract: When acquiring an image of a paper document, the image printed on the back page sometimes shows through. The mixture of the front- and back-page images thus obtained is markedly nonlinear, and thus constitutes a good real-life test case for nonlinear blind source separation. This paper addresses a difﬁcult version of this problem, corresponding to the use of “onion skin” paper, which results in a relatively strong nonlinearity of the mixture, which becomes close to singular in the lighter regions of the images. The separation is achieved through the MISEP technique, which is an extension of the well known INFOMAX method. The separation results are assessed with objective quality measures. They show an improvement over the results obtained with linear separation, but have room for further improvement.

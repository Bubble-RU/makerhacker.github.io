<p>Author: Günther Eibl, Karl-Peter Pfeiffer</p><p>Abstract: AdaBoost.M2 is a boosting algorithm designed for multiclass problems with weak base classiﬁers. The algorithm is designed to minimize a very loose bound on the training error. We propose two alternative boosting algorithms which also minimize bounds on performance measures. These performance measures are not as strongly connected to the expected error as the training error, but the derived bounds are tighter than the bound on the training error of AdaBoost.M2. In experiments the methods have roughly the same performance in minimizing the training and test error rates. The new algorithms have the advantage that the base classiﬁer should minimize the conﬁdence-rated error, whereas for AdaBoost.M2 the base classiﬁer should minimize the pseudo-loss. This makes them more easily applicable to already existing base classiﬁers. The new algorithms also tend to converge faster than AdaBoost.M2.

<p>Author: Koji Tsuda, Gunnar Rätsch, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix. The central issue is to design parameter updates that preserve positive deﬁniteness. Our updates are motivated with the von Neumann divergence. Rather than treating the most general case, we focus on two key applications that exemplify our methods: on-line learning with a simple square loss, and ﬁnding a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix subject to linear constraints. The updates generalize the exponentiated gradient (EG) update and AdaBoost, respectively: the parameter is now a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix of trace one instead of a probability vector (which in this context is a diagonal positive definite matrix with trace one). The generalized updates use matrix logarithms and exponentials to preserve positive deﬁniteness. Most importantly, we show how the derivation and the analyses of the original EG update and AdaBoost generalize to the non-diagonal case.

<p>Author: Savina Andonova Jaeger</p><p>Abstract: A uniﬁed approach is taken for deriving new generalization data dependent bounds for several classes of algorithms explored in the existing literature by different approaches. This uniﬁed approach is based on an extension of Vapnik’s inequality for VC classes of sets to random classes of sets - that is, classes depending on the random data, invariant under permutation of the data and possessing the increasing property. Generalization bounds are derived for convex combinations of functions from random classes with certain properties. Algorithms, such as SVMs (support vector machines), boosting with decision stumps, radial basis function networks, some hierarchies of kernel machines or convex combinations of indicator functions over sets with ﬁnite VC dimension, generate classiﬁer functions that fall into the above category. We also explore the individual complexities of the classiﬁers, such as sparsity of weights and weighted variance over clusters from the convex combination introduced by Koltchinskii and Panchenko (2004), and show sparsity-type and cluster-variance-type generalization bounds for random classes.

<p>Author: Roni Khardon, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has introduced Boolean kernels with which one can learn linear threshold functions over a feature space containing all conjunctions of length up to k (for any 1 ≤ k ≤ n) over the original n Boolean features in the input space. This motivates the question of whether maximum margin algorithms such as Support Vector Machines can learn Disjunctive Normal Form expressions in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model by using this kernel. We study this question, as well as a variant in which structural risk minimization (SRM) is performed where the class hierarchy is taken over the length of conjunctions. We show that maximum margin algorithms using the Boolean kernels do not PAC learn t(n)term DNF for any t(n) = ω(1), even when used with such a SRM scheme. We also consider PAC learning under the uniform distribution and show that if the kernel uses conjunctions of length √ ˜ ω( n) then the maximum margin hypothesis will fail on the uniform distribution as well. Our results concretely illustrate that margin based algorithms may overﬁt when learning simple target functions with natural kernels.

<p>Author: Ivor W. Tsang, James T. Kwok, Pak-Ming Cheung</p><p>Abstract: O(m3 ) Standard SVM training has time and O(m2 ) space complexities, where m is the training set size. It is thus computationally infeasible on very large data sets. By observing that practical SVM implementations only approximate the optimal solution by an iterative strategy, we scale up kernel methods by exploiting such “approximateness” in this paper. We ﬁrst show that many kernel methods can be equivalently formulated as minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problems in computational geometry. Then, by adopting an efﬁcient approximate MEB algorithm, we obtain provably approximately optimal solutions with the idea of core sets. Our proposed Core Vector Machine (CVM) algorithm can be used with nonlinear kernels and has a time complexity that is linear in m and a space complexity that is independent of m. Experiments on large toy and realworld data sets demonstrate that the CVM is as accurate as existing SVM implementations, but is much faster and can handle much larger data sets than existing scale-up methods. For example, CVM with the Gaussian kernel produces superior results on the KDDCUP-99 intrusion detection data, which has about ﬁve million training patterns, in only 1.4 seconds on a 3.2GHz Pentium–4 PC.

<p>Author: Gunnar Rätsch, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: AdaBoost produces a linear combination of base hypotheses and predicts with the sign of this linear combination. The linear combination may be viewed as a hyperplane in feature space where the base hypotheses form the features. It has been observed that the generalization error of the algorithm continues to improve even after all examples are on the correct side of the current hyperplane. The improvement is attributed to the experimental observation that the distances (margins) of the examples to the separating hyperplane are increasing even after all examples are on the correct side. We introduce a new version of AdaBoost, called AdaBoost∗ , that explicitly maximizes the ν minimum margin of the examples up to a given precision. The algorithm incorporates a current estimate of the achievable margin into its calculation of the linear coefﬁcients of the base hypotheses. The bound on the number of iterations needed by the new algorithms is the same as the number needed by a known version of AdaBoost that must have an explicit estimate of the achievable margin as a parameter. We also illustrate experimentally that our algorithm requires considerably fewer iterations than other algorithms that aim to maximize the margin.</p><p>3 0.35003439 <a title="29-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2005-Matrix_Exponentiated_Gradient_Updates_for_On-line_Learning_and_Bregman_Projection.html">55 jmlr-2005-Matrix Exponentiated Gradient Updates for On-line Learning and Bregman Projection</a></p>
<p>Author: Koji Tsuda, Gunnar Rätsch, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix. The central issue is to design parameter updates that preserve positive deﬁniteness. Our updates are motivated with the von Neumann divergence. Rather than treating the most general case, we focus on two key applications that exemplify our methods: on-line learning with a simple square loss, and ﬁnding a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix subject to linear constraints. The updates generalize the exponentiated gradient (EG) update and AdaBoost, respectively: the parameter is now a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix of trace one instead of a probability vector (which in this context is a diagonal positive definite matrix with trace one). The generalized updates use matrix logarithms and exponentials to preserve positive deﬁniteness. Most importantly, we show how the derivation and the analyses of the original EG update and AdaBoost generalize to the non-diagonal case. We apply the resulting matrix exponentiated gradient (MEG) update and DeﬁniteBoost to the problem of learning a kernel matrix from distance measurements.</p><p>4 0.348079 <a title="29-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2005-An_MDP-Based_Recommender_System.html">12 jmlr-2005-An MDP-Based Recommender System</a></p>
<p>Author: Guy Shani, David Heckerman, Ronen I. Brafman</p><p>Abstract: Typical recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation process and treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential optimization problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a more appropriate model for recommender systems. MDPs introduce two beneﬁts: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation and the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an MDP-based recommender system must employ a strong initial model, must be solvable quickly, and should not consume too much memory. In this paper, we describe our particular MDP model, its initialization using a predictive model, the solution and update algorithm, and its actual performance on a commercial site. We also describe the particular predictive model we used which outperforms previous models. Our system is one of a small number of commercially deployed recommender systems. As far as we know, it is the ﬁrst to report experimental analysis conducted on a real commercial site. These results validate the commercial value of recommender systems, and in particular, of our MDP-based approach.

<p>Author: Antoine Bordes, Seyda Ertekin, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou</p><p>Abstract: Very high dimensional learning systems become theoretically possible when training examples are abundant. The computing cost then becomes the limiting factor. Any efﬁcient learning algorithm should at least take a brief look at each example. But should all examples be given equal attention? This contribution proposes an empirical answer. We ﬁrst present an online SVM algorithm based on this premise. LASVM yields competitive misclassiﬁcation rates after a single pass over the training examples, outspeeding state-of-the-art SVM solvers. Then we show how active example selection can yield faster training, higher accuracies, and simpler models, using only a fraction of the training example labels.</p><p>6 0.34277031 <a title="29-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2005-On_the_Nystr%C3%B6m_Method_for_Approximating_a_Gram_Matrix_for_Improved_Kernel-Based_Learning.html">60 jmlr-2005-On the Nyström Method for Approximating a Gram Matrix for Improved Kernel-Based Learning</a></p>

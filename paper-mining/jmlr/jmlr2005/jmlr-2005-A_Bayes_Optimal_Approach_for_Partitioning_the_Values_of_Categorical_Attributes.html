<p>Author: Simone Fiori</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this contribution is to present a tutorial on learning algorithms for a single neural layer whose connection matrix belongs to the orthogonal group. The algorithms exploit geodesics appropriately connected as piece-wise approximate integrals of the exact differential learning equation. The considered learning equations essentially arise from the Riemannian-gradient-based optimization theory with deterministic and diffusion-type gradient. The paper aims speciﬁcally at reviewing the relevant mathematics (and at presenting it in as much transparent way as possible in order to make it accessible to readers that do not possess a background in differential geometry), at bringing together modern optimization methods on manifolds and at comparing the different algorithms on a common machine learning problem. As a numerical case-study, we consider an application to non-negative independent component analysis, although it should be recognized that Riemannian gradient methods give rise to general-purpose algorithms, by no means limited to ICA-related applications.

<p>Author: Joseph F. Murray, Gordon F. Hughes, Kenneth Kreutz-Delgado</p><p>Abstract: We compare machine learning methods applied to a difﬁcult real-world problem: predicting computer hard-drive failure using attributes monitored internally by individual drives. The problem is one of detecting rare events in a time series of noisy and nonparametrically-distributed data. We develop a new algorithm based on the multiple-instance learning framework and the naive Bayesian classiﬁer (mi-NB) which is speciﬁcally designed for the low false-alarm case, and is shown to have promising performance. Other methods compared are support vector machines (SVMs), unsupervised clustering, and non-parametric statistical tests (rank-sum and reverse arrangements). The failure-prediction performance of the SVM, rank-sum and mi-NB algorithm is considerably better than the threshold method currently implemented in drives, while maintaining low false alarm rates. Our results suggest that nonparametric statistical tests should be considered for learning problems involving detecting rare events in time series data. An appendix details the calculation of rank-sum signiﬁcance probabilities in the case of discrete, tied observations, and we give new recommendations about when the exact calculation should be used instead of the commonly-used normal approximation. These normal approximations may be particularly inaccurate for rare event problems like hard drive failures.

<p>Author: Dmitry Rusakov, Dan Geiger</p><p>Abstract: We develop a closed form asymptotic formula to compute the marginal likelihood of data given a naive Bayesian network model with two hidden states and binary features. This formula deviates from the standard BIC score. Our work provides a concrete example that the BIC score is generally incorrect for statistical models that belong to stratiﬁed exponential families. This claim stands in contrast to linear and curved exponential families, where the BIC score has been proven to provide a correct asymptotic approximation for the marginal likelihood.

<p>Author: Rie Kubota Ando, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: One of the most important issues in machine learning is whether one can improve the performance of a supervised learning algorithm by including unlabeled data. Methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data are generally referred to as semi-supervised learning. Although a number of such methods are proposed, at the current stage, we still don’t have a complete understanding of their eﬀectiveness. This paper investigates a closely related problem, which leads to a novel approach to semi-supervised learning. Speciﬁcally we consider learning predictive structures on hypothesis spaces (that is, what kind of classiﬁers have good predictive power) from multiple learning tasks. We present a general framework in which the structural learning problem can be formulated and analyzed theoretically, and relate it to learning with unlabeled data. Under this framework, algorithms for structural learning will be proposed, and computational issues will be investigated. Experiments will be given to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the semi-supervised learning setting.</p><p>6 0.04125081 <a title="1-tfidf-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Combining_Information_Extraction_Systems_Using_Voting_and_Stacked_Generalization.html">21 jmlr-2005-Combining Information Extraction Systems Using Voting and Stacked Generalization</a></p>

We study several methods designed to accelerate these iterative solvers, including prioritization, partitioning, and variable reordering.

<p>Author: Jaakko Särelä, Harri Valpola</p><p>Abstract: A new algorithmic framework called denoising source separation (DSS) is introduced. The main beneﬁt of this framework is that it allows for the easy development of new source separation algorithms which can be optimised for speciﬁc problems. In this framework, source separation algorithms are constructed around denoising procedures. The resulting algorithms can range from almost blind to highly specialised source separation algorithms. Both simple linear and more complex nonlinear or adaptive denoising schemes are considered. Some existing independent component analysis algorithms are reinterpreted within the DSS framework and new, robust blind source separation algorithms are suggested. The framework is derived as a one-unit equivalent to an EM algorithm for source separation. However, in the DSS framework it is easy to utilise various kinds of denoising procedures which need not be based on generative models. In the experimental section, various DSS schemes are applied extensively to artiﬁcial data, to real magnetoencephalograms and to simulated CDMA mobile network signals. Finally, various extensions to the proposed DSS algorithms are considered. These include nonlinear observation mappings, hierarchical models and over-complete, nonorthogonal feature spaces. With these extensions, DSS appears to have relevance to many existing models of neural information processing.

<p>Author: Ioannis Tsochantaridis, Thorsten Joachims, Thomas Hofmann, Yasemin Altun</p><p>Abstract: Learning general functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output spaces is one of the key challenges in computational intelligence. While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing ﬂexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classiﬁcation algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classiﬁcation problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.</p><p>4 0.25490841 <a title="1-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2005-Asymptotic_Model_Selection_for_Naive_Bayesian_Networks.html">15 jmlr-2005-Asymptotic Model Selection for Naive Bayesian Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Dmitry Rusakov, Dan Geiger</p><p>Abstract: We develop a closed form asymptotic formula to compute the marginal likelihood of data given a naive Bayesian network model with two hidden states and binary features. This formula deviates from the standard BIC score. Our work provides a concrete example that the BIC score is generally incorrect for statistical models that belong to stratiﬁed exponential families. This claim stands in contrast to linear and curved exponential families, where the BIC score has been proven to provide a correct asymptotic approximation for the marginal likelihood.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe new loss functions for regression problems along with an accompanying algorithmic framework which utilizes these functions. These loss functions are derived by symmetrization of margin-based losses commonly used in boosting algorithms, namely, the logistic loss and the exponential loss. The resulting symmetric logistic loss can be viewed as a smooth approximation to the ε-insensitive hinge loss used in support vector regression. We describe and analyze two parametric families of batch learning algorithms for minimizing these symmetric losses. The ﬁrst family employs an iterative log-additive update which can be viewed as a regression counterpart to recent boosting algorithms. The second family utilizes an iterative additive update step. We also describe and analyze online gradient descent (GD) and exponentiated gradient (EG) algorithms for the symmetric logistic loss. A byproduct of our work is a new simple form of regularization for boosting-based classiﬁcation and regression algorithms. Our regression framework also has implications on classiﬁcation algorithms, namely, a new additive update boosting algorithm for classiﬁcation. We demonstrate the merits of our algorithms in a series of experiments.</p><p>6 0.25027791 <a title="1-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Maximum_Margin_Algorithms_with_Boolean_Kernels.html">56 jmlr-2005-Maximum Margin Algorithms with Boolean Kernels</a></p>

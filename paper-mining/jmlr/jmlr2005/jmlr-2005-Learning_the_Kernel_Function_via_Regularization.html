<p>Author: Ernesto De Vito, Lorenzo Rosasco, Andrea Caponnetto, Umberto De Giovannini, Francesca Odone</p><p>Abstract: Many works related learning from examples to regularization techniques for inverse problems, emphasizing the strong algorithmic and conceptual analogy of certain learning algorithms with regularization algorithms. In particular it is well known that regularization schemes such as Tikhonov regularization can be effectively used in the context of learning and are closely related to algorithms such as support vector machines. Nevertheless the connection with inverse problem was considered only for the discrete (ﬁnite sample) problem and the probabilistic aspects of learning from examples were not taken into account. In this paper we provide a natural extension of such analysis to the continuous (population) case and study the interplay between the discrete and continuous problems. From a theoretical point of view, this allows to draw a clear connection between the consistency approach in learning theory and the stability convergence property in ill-posed inverse problems. The main mathematical result of the paper is a new probabilistic bound for the regularized least-squares algorithm. By means of standard results on the approximation term, the consistency of the algorithm easily follows.

<p>Author: Simone Fiori</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this contribution is to present a tutorial on learning algorithms for a single neural layer whose connection matrix belongs to the orthogonal group. The algorithms exploit geodesics appropriately connected as piece-wise approximate integrals of the exact differential learning equation. The considered learning equations essentially arise from the Riemannian-gradient-based optimization theory with deterministic and diffusion-type gradient. The paper aims speciﬁcally at reviewing the relevant mathematics (and at presenting it in as much transparent way as possible in order to make it accessible to readers that do not possess a background in differential geometry), at bringing together modern optimization methods on manifolds and at comparing the different algorithms on a common machine learning problem. As a numerical case-study, we consider an application to non-negative independent component analysis, although it should be recognized that Riemannian gradient methods give rise to general-purpose algorithms, by no means limited to ICA-related applications.

<p>Author: Theodoros Evgeniou, Charles A. Micchelli, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning many related tasks simultaneously using kernel methods and regularization. The standard single-task kernel methods, such as support vector machines and regularization networks, are extended to the case of multi-task learning. Our analysis shows that the problem of estimating many task functions with regularization can be cast as a single task learning problem if a family of multi-task kernel functions we deﬁne is used. These kernels model relations among the tasks and are derived from a novel form of regularizers. Speciﬁc kernels that can be used for multi-task learning are provided and experimentally tested on two real data sets. In agreement with past empirical work on multi-task learning, the experiments show that learning multiple related tasks simultaneously using the proposed approach can signiﬁcantly outperform standard single-task learning particularly when there are many related tasks but few data per task.

<p>Author: Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: A generalized discriminant analysis based on a new optimization criterion is presented. The criterion extends the optimization criteria of the classical Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) when the scatter matrices are singular. An efﬁcient algorithm for the new optimization problem is presented. The solutions to the proposed criterion form a family of algorithms for generalized LDA, which can be characterized in a closed form. We study two speciﬁc algorithms, namely Uncorrelated LDA (ULDA) and Orthogonal LDA (OLDA). ULDA was previously proposed for feature extraction and dimension reduction, whereas OLDA is a novel algorithm proposed in this paper. The features in the reduced space of ULDA are uncorrelated, while the discriminant vectors of OLDA are orthogonal to each other. We have conducted a comparative study on a variety of real-world data sets to evaluate ULDA and OLDA in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy.

<p>Author: Cheng Soon Ong, Alexander J. Smola, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of choosing a kernel suitable for estimation with a support vector machine, hence further automating machine learning. This goal is achieved by deﬁning a reproducing kernel Hilbert space on the space of kernels itself. Such a formulation leads to a statistical estimation problem similar to the problem of minimizing a regularized risk functional. We state the equivalent representer theorem for the choice of kernels and present a semideﬁnite programming formulation of the resulting optimization problem. Several recipes for constructing hyperkernels are provided, as well as the details of common machine learning problems. Experimental results for classiﬁcation, regression and novelty detection on UCI data show the feasibility of our approach.

Speciﬁc kernels that can be used for multi-task learning are provided and experimentally tested on two real data sets. In agreement with past empirical work on multi-task learning, the experiments show that learning multiple related tasks simultaneously using the proposed approach can signiﬁcantly outperform standard single-task learning particularly when there are many related tasks but few data per task.

<p>Author: Tong Luo, Kurt Kramer, Dmitry B. Goldgof, Lawrence O. Hall, Scott Samson, Andrew Remsen, Thomas Hopkins</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an active learning method which reduces the labeling effort of domain experts in multi-class classiﬁcation problems. Active learning is applied in conjunction with support vector machines to recognize underwater zooplankton from higher-resolution, new generation SIPPER II images. Most previous work on active learning with support vector machines only deals with two class problems. In this paper, we propose an active learning approach “breaking ties” for multiclass support vector machines using the one-vs-one approach with a probability approximation. Experimental results indicate that our approach often requires signiﬁcantly less labeled images to reach a given accuracy than the approach of labeling the least certain test example and random sampling. It can also be applied in batch mode resulting in an accuracy comparable to labeling one image at a time and retraining.

<p>Author: John Lafferty, Guy Lebanon</p><p>Abstract: A family of kernels for statistical learning is introduced that exploits the geometric structure of statistical models. The kernels are based on the heat equation on the Riemannian manifold deﬁned by the Fisher information metric associated with a statistical family, and generalize the Gaussian kernel of Euclidean space. As an important special case, kernels based on the geometry of multinomial families are derived, leading to kernel-based learning algorithms that apply naturally to discrete data. Bounds on covering numbers and Rademacher averages for the kernels are proved using bounds on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds. Experimental results are presented for document classiﬁcation, for which the use of multinomial geometry is natural and well motivated, and improvements are obtained over the standard use of Gaussian or linear kernels, which have been the standard for text classiﬁcation.

<p>Author: Antoine Bordes, Seyda Ertekin, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou</p><p>Abstract: Very high dimensional learning systems become theoretically possible when training examples are abundant. The computing cost then becomes the limiting factor. Any efﬁcient learning algorithm should at least take a brief look at each example. But should all examples be given equal attention? This contribution proposes an empirical answer. We ﬁrst present an online SVM algorithm based on this premise. LASVM yields competitive misclassiﬁcation rates after a single pass over the training examples, outspeeding state-of-the-art SVM solvers. Then we show how active example selection can yield faster training, higher accuracies, and simpler models, using only a fraction of the training example labels.</p><p>6 0.35512605 <a title="48-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Learning_from_Examples_as_an_Inverse_Problem.html">47 jmlr-2005-Learning from Examples as an Inverse Problem</a></p>

<p>Author: Arindam Banerjee, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Joydeep Ghosh, Suvrit Sra</p><p>Abstract: Several large scale data mining applications, such as text categorization and gene expression analysis, involve high-dimensional data that is also inherently directional in nature. Often such data is L2 normalized so that it lies on the surface of a unit hypersphere. Popular models such as (mixtures of) multi-variate Gaussians are inadequate for characterizing such data. This paper proposes a generative mixture-model approach to clustering directional data based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, which arises naturally for data distributed on the unit hypersphere. In particular, we derive and analyze two variants of the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework for estimating the mean and concentration parameters of this mixture. Numerical estimation of the concentration parameters is non-trivial in high dimensions since it involves functional inversion of ratios of Bessel functions. We also formulate two clustering algorithms corresponding to the variants of EM that we derive. Our approach provides a theoretical basis for the use of cosine similarity that has been widely employed by the information retrieval community, and obtains the spherical kmeans algorithm (kmeans with cosine similarity) as a special case of both variants. Empirical results on clustering of high-dimensional text and gene-expression data based on a mixture of vMF distributions show that the ability to estimate the concentration parameter for each vMF component, which is not present in existing approaches, yields superior results, especially for difﬁcult clustering tasks in high-dimensional spaces.

<p>Author: Lior Wolf, Amnon Shashua</p><p>Abstract: The problem of selecting a subset of relevant features in a potentially overwhelming quantity of data is classic and found in many branches of science. Examples in computer vision, text processing and more recently bio-informatics are abundant. In text classiﬁcation tasks, for example, it is not uncommon to have 104 to 107 features of the size of the vocabulary containing word frequency counts, with the expectation that only a small fraction of them are relevant. Typical examples include the automatic sorting of URLs into a web directory and the detection of spam email. In this work we present a deﬁnition of “relevancy” based on spectral properties of the Laplacian of the features’ measurement matrix. The feature selection process is then based on a continuous ranking of the features deﬁned by a least-squares optimization process. A remarkable property of the feature relevance function is that sparse solutions for the ranking values naturally emerge as a result of a “biased non-negativity” of a key matrix in the process. As a result, a simple leastsquares optimization process converges onto a sparse solution, i.e., a selection of a subset of features which form a local maximum over the relevance function. The feature selection algorithm can be embedded in both unsupervised and supervised inference problems and empirical evidence show that the feature selections typically achieve high accuracy even when only a small fraction of the features are relevant.</p><p>4 0.10994313 <a title="2-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2005-Local_Propagation_in_Conditional_Gaussian_Bayesian_Networks.html">51 jmlr-2005-Local Propagation in Conditional Gaussian Bayesian Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Eran Segal, Dana Pe'er, Aviv Regev, Daphne Koller, Nir Friedman</p><p>Abstract: Methods for learning Bayesian networks can discover dependency structure between observed variables. Although these methods are useful in many applications, they run into computational and statistical problems in domains that involve a large number of variables. In this paper,1 we consider a solution that is applicable when many variables have similar behavior. We introduce a new class of models, module networks, that explicitly partition the variables into modules, so that the variables in each module share the same parents in the network and the same conditional probability distribution. We deﬁne the semantics of module networks, and describe an algorithm that learns the modules’ composition and their dependency structure from data. Evaluation on real data in the domains of gene expression and the stock market shows that module networks generalize better than Bayesian networks, and that the learned module network structure reveals regularities that are obscured in learned Bayesian networks. 1.

<p>Author: Hyunsoo Kim, Peg Howland, Haesun Park</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) have been recognized as one of the most successful classiﬁcation methods for many applications including text classiﬁcation. Even though the learning ability and computational complexity of training in support vector machines may be independent of the dimension of the feature space, reducing computational complexity is an essential issue to efﬁciently handle a large number of terms in practical applications of text classiﬁcation. In this paper, we adopt novel dimension reduction methods to reduce the dimension of the document vectors dramatically. We also introduce decision functions for the centroid-based classiﬁcation algorithm and support vector classiﬁers to handle the classiﬁcation problem where a document may belong to multiple classes. Our substantial experimental results show that with several dimension reduction methods that are designed particularly for clustered data, higher efﬁciency for both training and testing can be achieved without sacriﬁcing prediction accuracy of text classiﬁcation even when the dimension of the input space is signiﬁcantly reduced.

<p>Author: John Langford</p><p>Abstract: We discuss basic prediction theory and its impact on classiﬁcation success evaluation, implications for learning algorithm design, and uses in learning algorithm execution. This tutorial is meant to be a comprehensive compilation of results which are both theoretically rigorous and quantitatively useful. There are two important implications of the results presented here. The ﬁrst is that common practices for reporting results in classiﬁcation should change to use the test set bound. The second is that train set bounds can sometimes be used to directly motivate learning algorithms.

<p>Author: Hal Daumé III, Daniel Marcu</p><p>Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for tackling the supervised clustering problem, the generic problem encountered in tasks such as reference matching, coreference resolution, identity uncertainty and record linkage. Our clustering model is based on the Dirichlet process prior, which enables us to deﬁne distributions over the countably inﬁnite sets that naturally arise in this problem. We add supervision to our model by positing the existence of a set of unobserved random variables (we call these “reference types”) that are generic across all clusters. Inference in our framework, which requires integrating over inﬁnitely many parameters, is solved using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors. We present a simple—but general—parameterization of our model based on a Gaussian assumption. We evaluate this model on one artiﬁcial task and three real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Our results show that our model is able to outperform other models across a variety of tasks and performance metrics.

<p>Author: Hyunsoo Kim, Peg Howland, Haesun Park</p><p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) have been recognized as one of the most successful classiﬁcation methods for many applications including text classiﬁcation. Even though the learning ability and computational complexity of training in support vector machines may be independent of the dimension of the feature space, reducing computational complexity is an essential issue to efﬁciently handle a large number of terms in practical applications of text classiﬁcation. In this paper, we adopt novel dimension reduction methods to reduce the dimension of the document vectors dramatically. We also introduce decision functions for the centroid-based classiﬁcation algorithm and support vector classiﬁers to handle the classiﬁcation problem where a document may belong to multiple classes. Our substantial experimental results show that with several dimension reduction methods that are designed particularly for clustered data, higher efﬁciency for both training and testing can be achieved without sacriﬁcing prediction accuracy of text classiﬁcation even when the dimension of the input space is signiﬁcantly reduced.

<p>Author: Arindam Banerjee, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Joydeep Ghosh, Suvrit Sra</p><p>Abstract: Several large scale data mining applications, such as text categorization and gene expression analysis, involve high-dimensional data that is also inherently directional in nature. Often such data is L2 normalized so that it lies on the surface of a unit hypersphere. Popular models such as (mixtures of) multi-variate Gaussians are inadequate for characterizing such data. This paper proposes a generative mixture-model approach to clustering directional data based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, which arises naturally for data distributed on the unit hypersphere. In particular, we derive and analyze two variants of the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework for estimating the mean and concentration parameters of this mixture. Numerical estimation of the concentration parameters is non-trivial in high dimensions since it involves functional inversion of ratios of Bessel functions. We also formulate two clustering algorithms corresponding to the variants of EM that we derive. Our approach provides a theoretical basis for the use of cosine similarity that has been widely employed by the information retrieval community, and obtains the spherical kmeans algorithm (kmeans with cosine similarity) as a special case of both variants. Empirical results on clustering of high-dimensional text and gene-expression data based on a mixture of vMF distributions show that the ability to estimate the concentration parameter for each vMF component, which is not present in existing approaches, yields superior results, especially for difﬁcult clustering tasks in high-dimensional spaces.

<p>Author: Shivani Agarwal, Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Sariel Har-Peled, Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We study generalization properties of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), a quantity that has been advocated as an evaluation criterion for the bipartite ranking problem. The AUC is a different term than the error rate used for evaluation in classiﬁcation problems; consequently, existing generalization bounds for the classiﬁcation error rate cannot be used to draw conclusions about the AUC. In this paper, we deﬁne the expected accuracy of a ranking function (analogous to the expected error rate of a classiﬁcation function), and derive distribution-free probabilistic bounds on the deviation of the empirical AUC of a ranking function (observed on a ﬁnite data sequence) from its expected accuracy. We derive both a large deviation bound, which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on a test sequence, and a uniform convergence bound, which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a learned ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on a training sequence. Our uniform convergence bound is expressed in terms of a new set of combinatorial parameters that we term the bipartite rank-shatter coefﬁcients; these play the same role in our result as do the standard VC-dimension related shatter coefﬁcients (also known as the growth function) in uniform convergence results for the classiﬁcation error rate. A comparison of our result with a recent uniform convergence result derived by Freund et al. (2003) for a quantity closely related to the AUC shows that the bound provided by our result can be considerably tighter.

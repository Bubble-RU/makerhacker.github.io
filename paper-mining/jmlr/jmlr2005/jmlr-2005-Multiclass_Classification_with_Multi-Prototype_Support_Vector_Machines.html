<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for approximations to intractable probabilistic models which is based on a free energy formulation. The approximation can be understood as replacing an average over the original intractable distribution with a tractable one. It requires two tractable probability distributions which are made consistent on a set of moments and encode diﬀerent features of the original intractable distribution. In this way we are able to use Gaussian approximations for models with discrete or bounded variables which allow us to include non-trivial correlations. These are neglected in many other methods. We test the framework on toy benchmark problems for binary variables on fully connected graphs and 2D grids and compare with other methods, such as loopy belief propagation. Good performance is already achieved by using single nodes as tractable substructures. Signiﬁcant improvements are obtained when a spanning tree is used instead.</p><p>3 0.091434114 <a title="58-tfidf-3" href="./jmlr-2005-Large_Margin_Methods_for_Structured_and_Interdependent_Output_Variables.html">42 jmlr-2005-Large Margin Methods for Structured and Interdependent Output Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Tsochantaridis, Thorsten Joachims, Thomas Hofmann, Yasemin Altun</p><p>Abstract: Learning general functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output spaces is one of the key challenges in computational intelligence. While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing ﬂexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classiﬁcation algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classiﬁcation problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.</p><p>4 0.054190364 <a title="58-tfidf-4" href="./jmlr-2005-Core_Vector_Machines%3A_Fast_SVM_Training_on_Very_Large_Data_Sets.html">24 jmlr-2005-Core Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivor W. Tsang, James T. Kwok, Pak-Ming Cheung</p><p>Abstract: O(m3 ) Standard SVM training has time and O(m2 ) space complexities, where m is the training set size. It is thus computationally infeasible on very large data sets. By observing that practical SVM implementations only approximate the optimal solution by an iterative strategy, we scale up kernel methods by exploiting such “approximateness” in this paper. We ﬁrst show that many kernel methods can be equivalently formulated as minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problems in computational geometry. Then, by adopting an efﬁcient approximate MEB algorithm, we obtain provably approximately optimal solutions with the idea of core sets. Our proposed Core Vector Machine (CVM) algorithm can be used with nonlinear kernels and has a time complexity that is linear in m and a space complexity that is independent of m. Experiments on large toy and realworld data sets demonstrate that the CVM is as accurate as existing SVM implementations, but is much faster and can handle much larger data sets than existing scale-up methods. For example, CVM with the Gaussian kernel produces superior results on the KDDCUP-99 intrusion detection data, which has about ﬁve million training patterns, in only 1.4 seconds on a 3.2GHz Pentium–4 PC.

<p>Author: Wei Chu, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic kernel approach to ordinal regression based on Gaussian processes. A threshold model that generalizes the probit function is used as the likelihood function for ordinal variables. Two inference techniques, based on the Laplace approximation and the expectation propagation algorithm respectively, are derived for hyperparameter learning and model selection. We compare these two Gaussian process approaches with a previous ordinal regression method based on support vector machines on some benchmark and real-world data sets, including applications of ordinal regression to collaborative ﬁltering and gene expression analysis. Experimental results on these data sets verify the usefulness of our approach.

<p>Author: Antoine Bordes, Seyda Ertekin, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou</p><p>Abstract: Very high dimensional learning systems become theoretically possible when training examples are abundant. The computing cost then becomes the limiting factor. Any efﬁcient learning algorithm should at least take a brief look at each example. But should all examples be given equal attention? This contribution proposes an empirical answer. We ﬁrst present an online SVM algorithm based on this premise. LASVM yields competitive misclassiﬁcation rates after a single pass over the training examples, outspeeding state-of-the-art SVM solvers. Then we show how active example selection can yield faster training, higher accuracies, and simpler models, using only a fraction of the training example labels.</p><p>5 0.19711265 <a title="58-lsi-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Core_Vector_Machines%3A_Fast_SVM_Training_on_Very_Large_Data_Sets.html">24 jmlr-2005-Core Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets</a></p>

These performance measures are not as strongly connected to the expected error as the training error, but the derived bounds are tighter than the bound on the training error of AdaBoost.M2. In experiments the methods have roughly the same performance in minimizing the training and test error rates. The new algorithms have the advantage that the base classiﬁer should minimize the conﬁdence-rated error, whereas for AdaBoost.M2 the base classiﬁer should minimize the pseudo-loss. This makes them more easily applicable to already existing base classiﬁers. The new algorithms also tend to converge faster than AdaBoost.M2.

<p>Author: Fabio Aiolli, Alessandro Sperduti</p><p>Abstract: Winner-take-all multiclass classiﬁers are built on the top of a set of prototypes each representing one of the available classes. A pattern is then classiﬁed with the label associated to the most ‘similar’ prototype. Recent proposal of SVM extensions to multiclass can be considered instances of the same strategy with one prototype per class. The multi-prototype SVM proposed in this paper extends multiclass SVM to multiple prototypes per class. It allows to combine several vectors in a principled way to obtain large margin decision functions. For this problem, we give a compact constrained quadratic formulation and we propose a greedy optimization algorithm able to ﬁnd locally optimal solutions for the non convex objective function. This algorithm proceeds by reducing the overall problem into a series of simpler convex problems. For the solution of these reduced problems an efﬁcient optimization algorithm is proposed. A number of pattern selection strategies are then discussed to speed-up the optimization process. In addition, given the combinatorial nature of the overall problem, stochastic search strategies are suggested to escape from local minima which are not globally optimal. Finally, we report experiments on a number of datasets. The performance obtained using few simple linear prototypes is comparable to that obtained by state-of-the-art kernel-based methods but with a signiﬁcant reduction (of one or two orders) in response time.

<p>Author: Gunnar Rätsch, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: AdaBoost produces a linear combination of base hypotheses and predicts with the sign of this linear combination. The linear combination may be viewed as a hyperplane in feature space where the base hypotheses form the features. It has been observed that the generalization error of the algorithm continues to improve even after all examples are on the correct side of the current hyperplane. The improvement is attributed to the experimental observation that the distances (margins) of the examples to the separating hyperplane are increasing even after all examples are on the correct side. We introduce a new version of AdaBoost, called AdaBoost∗ , that explicitly maximizes the ν minimum margin of the examples up to a given precision. The algorithm incorporates a current estimate of the achievable margin into its calculation of the linear coefﬁcients of the base hypotheses. The bound on the number of iterations needed by the new algorithms is the same as the number needed by a known version of AdaBoost that must have an explicit estimate of the achievable margin as a parameter. We also illustrate experimentally that our algorithm requires considerably fewer iterations than other algorithms that aim to maximize the margin.</p><p>4 0.31232437 <a title="58-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2005-Large_Margin_Methods_for_Structured_and_Interdependent_Output_Variables.html">42 jmlr-2005-Large Margin Methods for Structured and Interdependent Output Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis Tsochantaridis, Thorsten Joachims, Thomas Hofmann, Yasemin Altun</p><p>Abstract: Learning general functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output spaces is one of the key challenges in computational intelligence. While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing ﬂexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classiﬁcation algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classiﬁcation problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.</p><p>5 0.31089041 <a title="58-lda-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Inner_Product_Spaces_for_Bayesian_Networks.html">40 jmlr-2005-Inner Product Spaces for Bayesian Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Atsuyoshi Nakamura, Michael Schmitt, Niels Schmitt, Hans Ulrich Simon</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian networks have become one of the major models used for statistical inference. We study the question whether the decisions computed by a Bayesian network can be represented within a low-dimensional inner product space. We focus on two-label classiﬁcation tasks over the Boolean domain. As main results we establish upper and lower bounds on the dimension of the inner product space for Bayesian networks with an explicitly given (full or reduced) parameter collection. In particular, these bounds are tight up to a factor of 2. For some nontrivial cases of Bayesian networks we even determine the exact values of this dimension. We further consider logistic autoregressive Bayesian networks and show that every sufﬁciently expressive inner product space must have dimension at least Ω(n2 ), where n is the number of network nodes. We also derive the bound 2Ω(n) for an artiﬁcial variant of this network, thereby demonstrating the limits of our approach and raising an interesting open question. As a major technical contribution, this work reveals combinatorial and algebraic structures within Bayesian networks such that known methods for the derivation of lower bounds on the dimension of inner product spaces can be brought into play.

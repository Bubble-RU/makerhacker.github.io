<p>Author: Fabio Aiolli, Alessandro Sperduti</p><p>Abstract: Winner-take-all multiclass classiﬁers are built on the top of a set of prototypes each representing one of the available classes. A pattern is then classiﬁed with the label associated to the most ‘similar’ prototype. Recent proposal of SVM extensions to multiclass can be considered instances of the same strategy with one prototype per class. The multi-prototype SVM proposed in this paper extends multiclass SVM to multiple prototypes per class. It allows to combine several vectors in a principled way to obtain large margin decision functions. For this problem, we give a compact constrained quadratic formulation and we propose a greedy optimization algorithm able to ﬁnd locally optimal solutions for the non convex objective function. This algorithm proceeds by reducing the overall problem into a series of simpler convex problems. For the solution of these reduced problems an efﬁcient optimization algorithm is proposed. A number of pattern selection strategies are then discussed to speed-up the optimization process. In addition, given the combinatorial nature of the overall problem, stochastic search strategies are suggested to escape from local minima which are not globally optimal. Finally, we report experiments on a number of datasets. The performance obtained using few simple linear prototypes is comparable to that obtained by state-of-the-art kernel-based methods but with a signiﬁcant reduction (of one or two orders) in response time.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe new loss functions for regression problems along with an accompanying algorithmic framework which utilizes these functions. These loss functions are derived by symmetrization of margin-based losses commonly used in boosting algorithms, namely, the logistic loss and the exponential loss. The resulting symmetric logistic loss can be viewed as a smooth approximation to the ε-insensitive hinge loss used in support vector regression. We describe and analyze two parametric families of batch learning algorithms for minimizing these symmetric losses. The ﬁrst family employs an iterative log-additive update which can be viewed as a regression counterpart to recent boosting algorithms. The second family utilizes an iterative additive update step. We also describe and analyze online gradient descent (GD) and exponentiated gradient (EG) algorithms for the symmetric logistic loss. A byproduct of our work is a new simple form of regularization for boosting-based classiﬁcation and regression algorithms. Our regression framework also has implications on classiﬁcation algorithms, namely, a new additive update boosting algorithm for classiﬁcation. We demonstrate the merits of our algorithms in a series of experiments.</p><p>5 0.071031168 <a title="42-tfidf-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Gaussian_Processes_for_Ordinal_Regression.html">36 jmlr-2005-Gaussian Processes for Ordinal Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Chu, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic kernel approach to ordinal regression based on Gaussian processes. A threshold model that generalizes the probit function is used as the likelihood function for ordinal variables. Two inference techniques, based on the Laplace approximation and the expectation propagation algorithm respectively, are derived for hyperparameter learning and model selection. We compare these two Gaussian process approaches with a previous ordinal regression method based on support vector machines on some benchmark and real-world data sets, including applications of ordinal regression to collaborative ﬁltering and gene expression analysis. Experimental results on these data sets verify the usefulness of our approach.

<p>Author: Roni Khardon, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has introduced Boolean kernels with which one can learn linear threshold functions over a feature space containing all conjunctions of length up to k (for any 1 ≤ k ≤ n) over the original n Boolean features in the input space. This motivates the question of whether maximum margin algorithms such as Support Vector Machines can learn Disjunctive Normal Form expressions in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model by using this kernel. We study this question, as well as a variant in which structural risk minimization (SRM) is performed where the class hierarchy is taken over the length of conjunctions. We show that maximum margin algorithms using the Boolean kernels do not PAC learn t(n)term DNF for any t(n) = ω(1), even when used with such a SRM scheme. We also consider PAC learning under the uniform distribution and show that if the kernel uses conjunctions of length √ ˜ ω( n) then the maximum margin hypothesis will fail on the uniform distribution as well. Our results concretely illustrate that margin based algorithms may overﬁt when learning simple target functions with natural kernels.

In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.</p><p>2 0.33138633 <a title="42-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2005-Fast_Kernel_Classifiers_with_Online_and_Active_Learning.html">33 jmlr-2005-Fast Kernel Classifiers with Online and Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Antoine Bordes, Seyda Ertekin, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou</p><p>Abstract: Very high dimensional learning systems become theoretically possible when training examples are abundant. The computing cost then becomes the limiting factor. Any efﬁcient learning algorithm should at least take a brief look at each example. But should all examples be given equal attention? This contribution proposes an empirical answer. We ﬁrst present an online SVM algorithm based on this premise. LASVM yields competitive misclassiﬁcation rates after a single pass over the training examples, outspeeding state-of-the-art SVM solvers. Then we show how active example selection can yield faster training, higher accuracies, and simpler models, using only a fraction of the training example labels.</p><p>3 0.3267239 <a title="42-lda-3" href="./jmlr-2005-Smooth_%CE%B5-Insensitive_Regression_by_Loss_Symmetrization.html">66 jmlr-2005-Smooth ε-Insensitive Regression by Loss Symmetrization</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe new loss functions for regression problems along with an accompanying algorithmic framework which utilizes these functions. These loss functions are derived by symmetrization of margin-based losses commonly used in boosting algorithms, namely, the logistic loss and the exponential loss. The resulting symmetric logistic loss can be viewed as a smooth approximation to the ε-insensitive hinge loss used in support vector regression. We describe and analyze two parametric families of batch learning algorithms for minimizing these symmetric losses. The ﬁrst family employs an iterative log-additive update which can be viewed as a regression counterpart to recent boosting algorithms. The second family utilizes an iterative additive update step. We also describe and analyze online gradient descent (GD) and exponentiated gradient (EG) algorithms for the symmetric logistic loss. A byproduct of our work is a new simple form of regularization for boosting-based classiﬁcation and regression algorithms. Our regression framework also has implications on classiﬁcation algorithms, namely, a new additive update boosting algorithm for classiﬁcation. We demonstrate the merits of our algorithms in a series of experiments.</p><p>4 0.32448921 <a title="42-lda-4" href="./jmlr-2005-Clustering_with_Bregman_Divergences.html">20 jmlr-2005-Clustering with Bregman Divergences</a></p>
<p>Author: Arindam Banerjee, Srujana Merugu, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Joydeep Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: A wide variety of distortion functions, such as squared Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, Itakura-Saito distance and relative entropy, have been used for clustering. In this paper, we propose and analyze parametric hard and soft clustering algorithms based on a large class of distortion functions known as Bregman divergences. The proposed algorithms unify centroid-based parametric clustering approaches, such as classical kmeans, the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm and information-theoretic clustering, which arise by special choices of the Bregman divergence. The algorithms maintain the simplicity and scalability of the classical kmeans algorithm, while generalizing the method to a large class of clustering loss functions. This is achieved by ﬁrst posing the hard clustering problem in terms of minimizing the loss in Bregman information, a quantity motivated by rate distortion theory, and then deriving an iterative algorithm that monotonically decreases this loss. In addition, we show that there is a bijection between regular exponential families and a large class of Bregman divergences, that we call regular Bregman divergences. This result enables the development of an alternative interpretation of an efﬁcient EM scheme for learning mixtures of exponential family distributions, and leads to a simple soft clustering algorithm for regular Bregman divergences. Finally, we discuss the connection between rate distortion theory and Bregman clustering and present an information theoretic analysis of Bregman clustering algorithms in terms of a trade-off between compression and loss in Bregman information.

<p>Author: Aharon Bar-Hillel, Tomer Hertz, Noam Shental, Daphna Weinshall</p><p>Abstract: Many learning algorithms use a metric deﬁned over the input space as a principal tool, and their performance critically depends on the quality of this metric. We address the problem of learning metrics using side-information in the form of equivalence constraints. Unlike labels, we demonstrate that this type of side-information can sometimes be automatically obtained without the need of human intervention. We show how such side-information can be used to modify the representation of the data, leading to improved clustering and classiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, we present the Relevant Component Analysis (RCA) algorithm, which is a simple and efﬁcient algorithm for learning a Mahalanobis metric. We show that RCA is the solution of an interesting optimization problem, founded on an information theoretic basis. If dimensionality reduction is allowed within RCA, we show that it is optimally accomplished by a version of Fisher’s linear discriminant that uses constraints. Moreover, under certain Gaussian assumptions, RCA can be viewed as a Maximum Likelihood estimation of the within class covariance matrix. We conclude with extensive empirical evaluations of RCA, showing its advantage over alternative methods. Keywords: clustering, metric learning, dimensionality reduction, equivalence constraints, side information.</p><p>6 0.32156792 <a title="42-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Loopy_Belief_Propagation%3A_Convergence_and_Effects_of_Message_Errors.html">52 jmlr-2005-Loopy Belief Propagation: Convergence and Effects of Message Errors</a></p>

<p>Author: Savina Andonova Jaeger</p><p>Abstract: A uniﬁed approach is taken for deriving new generalization data dependent bounds for several classes of algorithms explored in the existing literature by different approaches. This uniﬁed approach is based on an extension of Vapnik’s inequality for VC classes of sets to random classes of sets - that is, classes depending on the random data, invariant under permutation of the data and possessing the increasing property. Generalization bounds are derived for convex combinations of functions from random classes with certain properties. Algorithms, such as SVMs (support vector machines), boosting with decision stumps, radial basis function networks, some hierarchies of kernel machines or convex combinations of indicator functions over sets with ﬁnite VC dimension, generate classiﬁer functions that fall into the above category. We also explore the individual complexities of the classiﬁers, such as sparsity of weights and weighted variance over clusters from the convex combination introduced by Koltchinskii and Panchenko (2004), and show sparsity-type and cluster-variance-type generalization bounds for random classes.

<p>Author: Manfred Opper, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for approximations to intractable probabilistic models which is based on a free energy formulation. The approximation can be understood as replacing an average over the original intractable distribution with a tractable one. It requires two tractable probability distributions which are made consistent on a set of moments and encode diﬀerent features of the original intractable distribution. In this way we are able to use Gaussian approximations for models with discrete or bounded variables which allow us to include non-trivial correlations. These are neglected in many other methods. We test the framework on toy benchmark problems for binary variables on fully connected graphs and 2D grids and compare with other methods, such as loopy belief propagation. Good performance is already achieved by using single nodes as tractable substructures. Signiﬁcant improvements are obtained when a spanning tree is used instead.</p><p>5 0.039514575 <a title="16-tfidf-5" href="./jmlr-2005-Assessing_Approximate_Inference_for_Binary_Gaussian_Process_Classification.html">14 jmlr-2005-Assessing Approximate Inference for Binary Gaussian Process Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Malte Kuss, Carl Edward Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian process priors can be used to deﬁne ﬂexible, probabilistic classiﬁcation models. Unfortunately exact Bayesian inference is analytically intractable and various approximation techniques have been proposed. In this work we review and compare Laplace’s method and Expectation Propagation for approximate Bayesian inference in the binary Gaussian process classiﬁcation model. We present a comprehensive comparison of the approximations, their predictive performance and marginal likelihood estimates to results obtained by MCMC sampling. We explain theoretically and corroborate empirically the advantages of Expectation Propagation compared to Laplace’s method.

<p>Author: Ingo Steinwart, Don Hush, Clint Scovel</p><p>Abstract: One way to describe anomalies is by saying that anomalies are not concentrated. This leads to the problem of ﬁnding level sets for the data generating density. We interpret this learning problem as a binary classiﬁcation problem and compare the corresponding classiﬁcation risk with the standard performance measure for the density level problem. In particular it turns out that the empirical classiﬁcation risk can serve as an empirical performance measure for the anomaly detection problem. This allows us to compare different anomaly detection algorithms empirically, i.e. with the help of a test set. Furthermore, by the above interpretation we can give a strong justiﬁcation for the well-known heuristic of artiﬁcially sampling “labeled” samples, provided that the sampling plan is well chosen. In particular this enables us to propose a support vector machine (SVM) for anomaly detection for which we can easily establish universal consistency. Finally, we report some experiments which compare our SVM to other commonly used methods including the standard one-class SVM.

<p>Author: Judy Goldsmith, Robert H. Sloan</p><p>Abstract: A revision algorithm is a learning algorithm that identiﬁes the target concept, starting from an initial concept. Such an algorithm is considered efﬁcient if its complexity (in terms of the measured resource) is polynomial in the syntactic distance between the initial and the target concept, but only polylogarithmic in the number of variables in the universe. We give efﬁcient revision algorithms in the model of learning with equivalence and membership queries. The algorithms work in a general revision model where both deletion and addition revision operators are allowed. In this model one of the main open problems is the efﬁcient revision of Horn formulas. Two revision algorithms are presented for special cases of this problem: for depth-1 acyclic Horn formulas, and for deﬁnite Horn formulas with unique heads.

Consider a collection {ha } of classiﬁers indexed by a ﬁnite-dimensional parameter a, and the classiﬁer ha∗ that minimizes the prediction error over this class. The parameter a∗ is estimated by the empirical risk minimizer an over the class, where the empirical risk is calculated on a training sample of size n. We apply ˆ the Kim Pollard Theorem to show that under certain differentiability assumptions, an converges to ˆ a∗ with rate n−1/3 , and also present the asymptotic distribution of the renormalized estimator. For example, let V0 denote the set of x on which, given X = x, the label Y = 1 is more likely (than the label Y = −1). If X is one-dimensional, the set V0 is the union of disjoint intervals. The problem is then to estimate the thresholds of the intervals. We obtain the asymptotic distribution of the empirical risk minimizer when the classiﬁers have K thresholds, where K is ﬁxed. We furthermore consider an extension to higher-dimensional X, assuming basically that V0 has a smooth boundary in some given parametric class. We also discuss various rates of convergence when the differentiability conditions are possibly violated. Here, we again restrict ourselves to one-dimensional X. We show that the rate is n−1 in certain cases, and then also obtain the asymptotic distribution for the empirical prediction error.

<p>Author: Savina Andonova Jaeger</p><p>Abstract: A uniﬁed approach is taken for deriving new generalization data dependent bounds for several classes of algorithms explored in the existing literature by different approaches. This uniﬁed approach is based on an extension of Vapnik’s inequality for VC classes of sets to random classes of sets - that is, classes depending on the random data, invariant under permutation of the data and possessing the increasing property. Generalization bounds are derived for convex combinations of functions from random classes with certain properties. Algorithms, such as SVMs (support vector machines), boosting with decision stumps, radial basis function networks, some hierarchies of kernel machines or convex combinations of indicator functions over sets with ﬁnite VC dimension, generate classiﬁer functions that fall into the above category. We also explore the individual complexities of the classiﬁers, such as sparsity of weights and weighted variance over clusters from the convex combination introduced by Koltchinskii and Panchenko (2004), and show sparsity-type and cluster-variance-type generalization bounds for random classes.

<p>Author: Andreas Maurer</p><p>Abstract: A mechnism of transfer learning is analysed, where samples drawn from different learning tasks of an environment are used to improve the learners performance on a new task. We give a general method to prove generalisation error bounds for such meta-algorithms. The method can be applied to the bias learning model of J. Baxter and to derive novel generalisation bounds for metaalgorithms searching spaces of uniformly stable algorithms. We also present an application to regularized least squares regression.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe new loss functions for regression problems along with an accompanying algorithmic framework which utilizes these functions. These loss functions are derived by symmetrization of margin-based losses commonly used in boosting algorithms, namely, the logistic loss and the exponential loss. The resulting symmetric logistic loss can be viewed as a smooth approximation to the ε-insensitive hinge loss used in support vector regression. We describe and analyze two parametric families of batch learning algorithms for minimizing these symmetric losses. The ﬁrst family employs an iterative log-additive update which can be viewed as a regression counterpart to recent boosting algorithms. The second family utilizes an iterative additive update step. We also describe and analyze online gradient descent (GD) and exponentiated gradient (EG) algorithms for the symmetric logistic loss. A byproduct of our work is a new simple form of regularization for boosting-based classiﬁcation and regression algorithms. Our regression framework also has implications on classiﬁcation algorithms, namely, a new additive update boosting algorithm for classiﬁcation. We demonstrate the merits of our algorithms in a series of experiments.</p><p>6 0.25892895 <a title="16-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2005-Asymptotic_Model_Selection_for_Naive_Bayesian_Networks.html">15 jmlr-2005-Asymptotic Model Selection for Naive Bayesian Networks</a></p>

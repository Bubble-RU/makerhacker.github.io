We show that this characterization is essentially equivalent to the original characterization proposed in Ye (2005). The computational advantage of the original characterization over the new one is discussed, which justiﬁes its practical use. Keywords: linear discriminant analysis, dimension reduction, linear transformation 1. Generalized Fisher Criterion For a given data set consisting of n data points {ai }n in IRd , a linear transformation G ∈ IRd× i=1 ( < d) maps each ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ n in the d-dimensional space to a vector ai in the -dimensional ˜ space as follows: G : ai ∈ IRd → ai = GT ai ∈ IR . ˜ Assume that there are k classes in the data set. The within-class scatter matrix S w , the betweenclass scatter matrix Sb , and the total scatter matrix St involved in linear discriminant analysis are deﬁned as follows (Fukunaga, 1990): k Sw = ∑ (Ai − ci eT )(Ai − ci eT )T , i=1 k Sb = ∑ ni (ci − c)(ci − c)T , i=1 k St = ∑ (Ai − ceT )(Ai − ceT )T , i=1 where Ai denotes the data matrix of the i-th class, ci = Ai e/ni is the centroid of the i-th class, ni is the sample size of the i-th class, c = Ae/n is the global centroid, and e is the vector of all ones with an appropriate length. It is easy to verify that St = Sb + Sw . In Ye (2005), the optimal transformation G is computed by maximizing a generalized Fisher criterion as follows: + G = arg max trace GT St G GT Sb G , (1) m× G∈IR c 2008 Jieping Ye. YE where M + denotes the pseudo-inverse (Golub and Van Loan, 1996) of M and it is introduced to overcome the singularity problem when dealing with high-dimensional low-sample-size data. 1.1 Equivalent Transformation Two linear transformations G1 and G2 can be considered equivalent if there is a vector v such that GT (ai − v) = GT (ai − v), for i = 1, · · · , n. Indeed, in this case, the difference between the projections 1 2 by G1 and G2 is a mere shift. Deﬁnition 1.1 For a given data set {a1 , · · · , an }, two transformations G1 and G2 are equivalent, if there is a vector v such that GT (ai − v) = GT (ai − v), for i = 1, · · · , n. 1 2 2. Characterization of Solutions to the Generalized Fisher Criterion Let St = UΣU T be the orthogonal eigendecomposition of St (note that St is symmetric and positive semi-deﬁnite), where U ∈ IRd×d is orthogonal and Σ ∈ IRd×d is diagonal with nonnegative diagonal entries sorted in nonincreasing order. Denote Σr as the r-th principal submatrix of Σ, where r = rank(St ). Partition U into two components as U = [U1 ,U2 ], where U1 ∈ IRd×r and U2 ∈ IRd×(d−r) . Note that r ≤ n, and for high-dimensional low-sample-size data, U1 is much smaller than U2 . In Loog (2007), a complete family of solutions S to the maximization problem in Eq. (1) is given as (We correct the error in Loog (2007) by using U instead of U T .) S= U ΛZ Y ∈ IRd× Z ∈ IR × is nonsingular , Y ∈ IR(n−r)× , where Λ ∈ IRr× maximizes the following objective function: F0 (X) = trace −1 X T Σr X T X T (U1 SbU1 )X . ˜ In Ye (2005), a family of solutions S is given as ˜ S= U ΛZ 0 ∈ IRd× Z ∈ IR × is nonsingular . The only difference between these two characterizations of solutions is the matrix Y in S , which is ˜ replaced by the zero matrix in S . We show in the next section the equivalence relationship between these two characterizations. 3. Equivalent Solution Characterizations ˜ Consider the following two transformations G1 and G2 from S and S respectively: G1 = U ΛZ Y ∈ S, G2 = U 518 ΛZ 0 ˜ ∈ S. O N THE C OMPLETE C HARACTERIZATION OF S OLUTIONS TO A G ENERALIZED F ISHER C RITERION Recall that U = [U1 ,U2 ], where the columns of U2 span the null space of St . Hence, n T T T 0 = U2 St U2 = ∑ U2 (ai − c) · (U2 (ai − c))T , i=1 T and U2 (ai − c) = 0, for i = 1, · · · , n, where c is the global centroid. It follows that T T T GT (ai − c) = Z T ΛT U1 (ai − c) +Y T U2 (ai − c) = Z T ΛT U1 (ai − c) = GT (ai − c), 1 2 for i = 1, · · · , n. That is, G1 and G2 are equivalent transformations. Hence, the two solution charac˜ terizations S and S are essentially equivalent. Remark 3.1 The analysis above shows that the additional information contained in S is the null ˜ space, U2 , of St , which leads to an equivalent transformation. In S , the null space U2 is removed, which can be further justiﬁed as follows. Since St = Sb + Sw , we have T T T 0 = U2 St U2 = U2 SbU2 +U2 SwU2 . T It follows that U2 SbU2 = 0, as both Sb and Sw are positive semi-deﬁnite. Thus, the null space U2 does not contain any discriminant information. This explains why the null space of St is removed in most discriminant analysis based algorithms proposed in the past. 4. Efﬁciency Comparison In S , the full matrix U is involved, whose computation may be expensive, especially for high˜ dimensional data. In contrast, only the ﬁrst component U1 ∈ IRd×r of U is involved in S , which can be computed efﬁciently for high-dimensional low-sample-size problem by directly working on the Gram matrix instead of the covariance matrix. ˜ In summary, we show that S and S are equivalent characterizations of the solutions to the generalized Fisher criterion in Eq. (1). However, the latter one is preferred in practice due to its relative efﬁciency for high-dimensional low-sample-size data. References K. Fukunaga.

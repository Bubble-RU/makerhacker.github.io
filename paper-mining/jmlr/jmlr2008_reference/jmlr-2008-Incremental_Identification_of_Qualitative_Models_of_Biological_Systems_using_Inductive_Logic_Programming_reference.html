<h1>44 jmlr-2008-Incremental Identification of Qualitative Models of Biological Systems using Inductive Logic Programming</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2008-44-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume9/srinivasan08a/srinivasan08a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ashwin Srinivasan, Ross D. King</p><p>Abstract: The use of computational models is increasingly expected to play an important role in predicting the behaviour of biological systems. Models are being sought at different scales of biological organisation namely: sub-cellular, cellular, tissue, organ, organism and ecosystem; with a view of identifying how different components are connected together, how they are controlled and how they behave when functioning as a system. Except for very simple biological processes, system identiﬁcation from ﬁrst principles can be extremely difﬁcult. This has brought into focus automated techniques for constructing models using data of system behaviour. Such techniques face three principal issues: (1) The model representation language must be rich enough to capture system behaviour; (2) The system identiﬁcation technique must be powerful enough to identify substantially complex models; and (3) There may not be sufﬁcient data to obtain both the model’s structure and precise estimates of all of its parameters. In this paper, we address these issues in the following ways: (1) Models are represented in an expressive subset of ﬁrst-order logic. Speciﬁcally, they are expressed as logic programs; (2) System identiﬁcation is done using techniques developed in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). This allows the identiﬁcation of ﬁrst-order logic models from data. Speciﬁcally, we employ an incremental approach in which increasingly complex models are constructed from simpler ones using snapshots of system behaviour; and (3) We restrict ourselves to “qualitative” models. These are non-parametric: thus, usually less data are required than for identifying parametric quantitative models. A further advantage is that the data need not be precise numerical observations (instead, they are abstractions like positive, negative, zero, increasing, decreasing and so on). We describe incremental construction of qualitative models using a simple physical system and demonstrate its application to identiﬁcatio</p><br/>

V'yugin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper the sequential prediction problem with expert advice is considered for the case where losses of experts suffered at each step cannot be bounded in advance. We present some modiﬁcation of Kalai and Vempala algorithm of following the perturbed leader where weights depend on past losses of the experts. New notions of a volume and a scaled ﬂuctuation of a game are introduced. We present a probabilistic algorithm protected from unrestrictedly large one-step losses. This algorithm has the optimal performance in the case when the scaled ﬂuctuations of one-step losses of experts of the pool tend to zero. Keywords: prediction with expert advice, follow the perturbed leader, unbounded losses, adaptive learning rate, expected bounds, Hannan consistency, online sequential prediction</p><br/>

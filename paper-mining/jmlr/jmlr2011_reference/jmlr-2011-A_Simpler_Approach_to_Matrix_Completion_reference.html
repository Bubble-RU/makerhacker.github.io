These results improve on prior work by Cand` s and e Recht (2009), Cand` s and Tao (2009), and Keshavan et al. (2009). The reconstruction is accome plished by minimizing the nuclear norm, or sum of the singular values, of the hidden matrix subject to agreement with the provided entries. If the underlying matrix satisﬁes a certain incoherence condition, then the number of entries required is equal to a quadratic logarithmic factor times the number of parameters in the singular value decomposition. The proof of this assertion is short, self contained, and uses very elementary analysis. The novel techniques herein are based on recent work in quantum information theory. Keywords: matrix completion, low-rank matrices, convex optimization, nuclear norm minimization, random matrices, operator Chernoff bound, compressed sensing</p><br/>

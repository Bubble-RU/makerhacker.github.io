The packages provide comprehensive functionality for analyzing interesting patterns including frequent itemsets, association rules, frequent sequences and for building applications like associative classiﬁcation. After discussing the ecosystem’s design we illustrate the ease of mining and visualizing rules with a short example. Keywords: frequent itemsets, association rules, frequent sequences, visualization 1. Overview Mining frequent itemsets and association rules is a popular and well researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. Association rules are used in many applications and have become prominent as an important exploratory method for uncovering cross-selling opportunities in large retail databases. Agrawal et al. (1993) introduced the problem of mining association rules from transaction data as follows: Let I = {i1 , i2 , . . . , in } be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let D = {t1 ,t2 , . . . ,tm } be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I. A rule is deﬁned as an implication of the form X ⇒ Y where / X,Y ⊆ I and X ∩ Y = 0 are called itemsets. On itemsets and rules several quality measures can be deﬁned. The most important measures are support and conﬁdence. The support supp(X) of an itemset X is deﬁned as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the itemset. Itemsets with a support which surpasses a user deﬁned threshold σ are called frequent itemsets. The conﬁdence of a rule is deﬁned as conf(X ⇒ Y ) = supp(X ∪Y )/supp(X). Association rules are rules with supp(X ∪Y ) ≥ σ and conf(X) ≥ δ where σ and δ are user deﬁned thresholds. ©2011 Michael Hahsler, Sudheer Chelluboina, Kurt Hornik and Christian Buchta. H AHSLER , C HELLUBOINA , H ORNIK AND B UCHTA Figure 1: The arules ecosystem. The R package arules (Hahsler et al., 2005, 2010) implements the basic infrastructure for creating and manipulating transaction databases and basic algorithms to efﬁciently ﬁnd and analyze association rules. Over the last ﬁve years several packages were built around the arules infrastructure to create the ecosystem shown in Figure 1. Compared to other tools, the arules ecosystem is fully integrated, implements the latest approaches and has the vast functionality of R for further analysis of found patterns at its disposal. 2. Design and Implementation The core package arules provides an object-oriented framework to represent transaction databases and patterns. To facilitate extensibility, patterns are implemented as an abstract superclass associations and then concrete subclasses implement individual types of patterns. In arules the associations itemsets and rules are provided. Databases and associations both use a sparse matrix representation for efﬁcient storage and basic operations like sorting, subsetting and matching are supported. Different aspects of arules were discussed in previous publications (Hahsler et al., 2005; Hahsler and Hornik, 2007b,a; Hahsler et al., 2008). In this paper we focus on the ecosystem of several R-packages which are built on top of the arules infrastructure. While arules provides Apriori and Eclat (implementations by Borgelt, 2003), two of the most important frequent itemset/association rule mining algorithms, additional algorithms can easily be added as new packages. For example, package arulesNBMiner (Hahsler, 2010) implements an algorithm to ﬁnd NB-frequent itemsets (Hahsler, 2006). A collection of further implementations which could be interfaced by arules in the future and a comparison of state-of-the-art algorithms can be found at the Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Repository.1 arulesSequences (Buchta and Hahsler, 2010) implements mining frequent sequences in transaction databases. It implements additional association classes called sequences and sequencerules and provides the algorithm cSpade (Zaki, 2001) to efﬁciently mine frequent sequences. Another application currently under development is arulesClassify which uses the arules infrastructure to implement rule-based classiﬁers, including Classiﬁcation Based on Association rules (CBA, Liu et al., 1998) and general associative classiﬁcation techniques (Jalali-Heravi and Zaïane, 2010). A known drawback of mining for frequent patterns such as association rules is that typically the algorithm returns a very large set of results where only a small fraction of patterns is of interest to the analysts. Many researchers introduced visualization techniques including scatter plots, matrix 1.

Finally, arules provides a Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) interface to import and export rules via package pmml (Williams et al., 2010). PMML is the leading standard for exchanging statistical and data mining models and is supported by all major solution providers. Although pmml provides interfaces for different packages it is still considered part of the arules ecosystem. The packages in the described ecosystem are available for Linux, OS X and Windows. All packages are distributed via the Comprehensive R Archive Network2 under GPL-2, along with comprehensive manuals, documentation, regression tests and source code. Development versions of most packages are available from R-Forge.3 3. User Interface We illustrate the user interface and the interaction between the packages in the arules ecosystem with a small example using a retail data set called Groceries which contains 9835 transactions with items aggregated to 169 categories. We mine association rules and then present the rules found as well as the top 3 rules according to the interest measure lift (deviation from independence) in two visualizations. > > > > library(</p><br/>

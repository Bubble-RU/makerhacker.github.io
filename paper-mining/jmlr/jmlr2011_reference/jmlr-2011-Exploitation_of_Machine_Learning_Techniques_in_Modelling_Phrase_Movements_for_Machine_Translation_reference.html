<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2011-32-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume12/ni11a/ni11a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Yizhao Ni, Craig Saunders, Sandor Szedmak, Mahesan Niranjan</p><p>Abstract: We propose a distance phrase reordering model (DPR) for statistical machine translation (SMT), where the aim is to learn the grammatical rules and context dependent changes using a phrase reordering classiﬁcation framework. We consider a variety of machine learning techniques, including state-of-the-art structured prediction methods. Techniques are compared and evaluated on a Chinese-English corpus, a language pair known for the high reordering characteristics which cannot be adequately captured with current models. In the reordering classiﬁcation task, the method signiﬁcantly outperforms the baseline against which it was tested, and further, when integrated as a component of the state-of-the-art machine translation system, MOSES, it achieves improvement in translation results. Keywords: statistical machine translation (SMT), phrase reordering, lexicalized reordering (LR), maximum entropy (ME), support vector machine (SVM), maximum margin regression (MMR) , max-margin structure learning (MMS)</p><br/>

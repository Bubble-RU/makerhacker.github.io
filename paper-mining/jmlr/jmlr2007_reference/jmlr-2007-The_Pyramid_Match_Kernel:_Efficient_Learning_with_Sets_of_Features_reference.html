<h1>84 jmlr-2007-The Pyramid Match Kernel: Efficient Learning with Sets of Features</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2007-84-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume8/grauman07a/grauman07a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Kristen Grauman, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: In numerous domains it is useful to represent a single example by the set of the local features or parts that comprise it. However, this representation poses a challenge to many conventional machine learning techniques, since sets may vary in cardinality and elements lack a meaningful ordering. Kernel methods can learn complex functions, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences—generally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function called the pyramid match that measures partial match similarity in time linear in the number of features. The pyramid match maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in order to ﬁnd implicit correspondences based on the ﬁnest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair ﬁrst appears. We show the pyramid match yields a Mercer kernel, and we prove bounds on its error relative to the optimal partial matching cost. We demonstrate our algorithm on both classiﬁcation and regression tasks, including object recognition, 3-D human pose inference, and time of publication estimation for documents, and we show that the proposed method is accurate and signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than current approaches. Keywords: kernel, sets of features, histogram intersection, multi-resolution histogram pyramid, approximate matching, object recognition</p><br/>

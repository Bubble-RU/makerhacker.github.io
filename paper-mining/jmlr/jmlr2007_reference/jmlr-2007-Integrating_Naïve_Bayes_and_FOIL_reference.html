<br/><p>Source: <a title="jmlr-2007-43-pdf" href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume8/landwehr07a/landwehr07a.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Niels Landwehr, Kristian Kersting, Luc De Raedt</p><p>Abstract: A novel relational learning approach that tightly integrates the na¨ve Bayes learning scheme with ı the inductive logic programming rule-learner FOIL is presented. In contrast to previous combinations that have employed na¨ve Bayes only for post-processing the rule sets, the presented approach ı employs the na¨ve Bayes criterion to guide its search directly. The proposed technique is impleı mented in the N FOIL and T FOIL systems, which employ standard na¨ve Bayes and tree augmented ı na¨ve Bayes models respectively. We show that these integrated approaches to probabilistic model ı and rule learning outperform post-processing approaches. They also yield signiﬁcantly more accurate models than simple rule learning and are competitive with more sophisticated ILP systems. Keywords: rule learning, na¨ve Bayes, statistical relational learning, inductive logic programming ı</p><br/>

<p>Author: Zakria Hussain, François Laviolette, Mario Marchand, John Shawe-Taylor, Spencer Charles Brubaker, Matthew D. Mullin</p><p>Abstract: Marchand and Shawe-Taylor (2002) have proposed a loss bound for the set covering machine that has the property to depend on the observed fraction of positive examples and on what the classiﬁer achieves on the positive training examples. We show that this loss bound is incorrect. We then propose a loss bound, valid for any sample-compression learning algorithm (including the set covering machine), that depends on the observed fraction of positive examples and on what the classiﬁer achieves on them. We also compare numerically the loss bound proposed in this paper with the incorrect bound, the original SCM bound and a recently proposed loss bound of Marchand and Sokolova (2005) (which does not depend on the observed fraction of positive examples) and show that the latter loss bounds can be substantially larger than the new bound in the presence of imbalanced misclassiﬁcations.

<p>Author: Marc Boullé</p><p>Abstract: The naive Bayes classiﬁer has proved to be very effective on many real data applications. Its performance usually beneﬁts from an accurate estimation of univariate conditional probabilities and from variable selection. However, although variable selection is a desirable feature, it is prone to overﬁtting. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian regularization technique to select the most probable subset of variables compliant with the naive Bayes assumption. We also study the limits of Bayesian model averaging in the case of the naive Bayes assumption and introduce a new weighting scheme based on the ability of the models to conditionally compress the class labels. The weighting scheme on the models reduces to a weighting scheme on the variables, and ﬁnally results in a naive Bayes classiﬁer with “soft variable selection”. Extensive experiments show that the compressionbased averaged classiﬁer outperforms the Bayesian model averaging scheme.

<p>Author: Roland Nilsson, José M. Peña, Johan Björkegren, Jesper Tegnér</p><p>Abstract: We analyze two different feature selection problems: ﬁnding a minimal feature set optimal for classiﬁcation (MINIMAL - OPTIMAL) vs. ﬁnding all features relevant to the target variable (ALL RELEVANT ). The latter problem is motivated by recent applications within bioinformatics, particularly gene expression analysis. For both problems, we identify classes of data distributions for which there exist consistent, polynomial-time algorithms. We also prove that ALL - RELEVANT is much harder than MINIMAL - OPTIMAL and propose two consistent, polynomial-time algorithms. We argue that the distribution classes considered are reasonable in many practical cases, so that our results simplify feature selection in a wide range of machine learning tasks.

<p>Author: Gavin C. Cawley, Nicola L. C. Talbot</p><p>Abstract: While the model parameters of a kernel machine are typically given by the solution of a convex optimisation problem, with a single global optimum, the selection of good values for the regularisation and kernel parameters is much less straightforward. Fortunately the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure can be performed or a least approximated very efﬁciently in closed form for a wide variety of kernel learning methods, providing a convenient means for model selection. Leave-one-out cross-validation based estimates of performance, however, generally exhibit a relatively high variance and are therefore prone to over-ﬁtting. In this paper, we investigate the novel use of Bayesian regularisation at the second level of inference, adding a regularisation term to the model selection criterion corresponding to a prior over the hyper-parameter values, where the additional regularisation parameters are integrated out analytically. Results obtained on a suite of thirteen real-world and synthetic benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the beneﬁt of this approach.

<p>Author: Nicolás García-Pedrajas, César García-Osorio, Colin Fyfe</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel approach for ensemble construction based on the use of nonlinear projections to achieve both accuracy and diversity of individual classiﬁers. The proposed approach combines the philosophy of boosting, putting more effort on difﬁcult instances, with the basis of the random subspace method. Our main contribution is that instead of using a random subspace, we construct a projection taking into account the instances which have posed most difﬁculties to previous classiﬁers. In this way, consecutive nonlinear projections are created by a neural network trained using only incorrectly classiﬁed instances. The feature subspace induced by the hidden layer of this network is used as the input space to a new classiﬁer. The method is compared with bagging and boosting techniques, showing an improved performance on a large set of 44 problems from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. An additional study showed that the proposed approach is less sensitive to noise in the data than boosting methods.

<p>Author: Sébastien Gadat, Laurent Younes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new model addressing feature selection from a large dictionary of variables that can be computed from a signal or an image. Features are extracted according to an efﬁciency criterion, on the basis of speciﬁed classiﬁcation or recognition tasks. This is done by estimating a probability distribution P on the complete dictionary, which distributes its mass over the more efﬁcient, or informative, components. We implement a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, using the probability as a state variable and optimizing a multi-task goodness of ﬁt criterion for classiﬁers based on variable randomly chosen according to P. We then generate classiﬁers from the optimal distribution of weights learned on the training set. The method is ﬁrst tested on several pattern recognition problems including face detection, handwritten digit recognition, spam classiﬁcation and micro-array analysis. We then compare our approach with other step-wise algorithms like random forests or recursive feature elimination.

<p>Author: Yiming Ying, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances provide a rich family of Mercer kernels for learning algorithms. We show that the union of the unit balls of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces generated by Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli (uGC) class. This result conﬁrms a conjecture concerning learnability of Gaussian kernels and veriﬁes the uniform convergence of many learning algorithms involving Gaussians with changing variances. Rademacher averages and empirical covering numbers are used to estimate sample errors of multi-kernel regularization schemes associated with general loss functions. It is then shown that the regularization error associated with the least square loss and the Gaussian kernels can be greatly improved when ﬂexible variances are allowed. Finally, for regularization schemes generated by Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances we present explicit learning rates for regression with least square loss and classiﬁcation with hinge loss.

<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Mikhail Traskin</p><p>Abstract: The risk, or probability of error, of the classiﬁer produced by the AdaBoost algorithm is investigated. In particular, we consider the stopping strategy to be used in AdaBoost to achieve universal consistency. We show that provided AdaBoost is stopped after n1−ε iterations—for sample size n and ε ∈ (0, 1)—the sequence of risks of the classiﬁers it produces approaches the Bayes risk.

<p>Author: Iain Melvin, Eugene Ie, Jason Weston, William Stafford Noble, Christina Leslie</p><p>Abstract: Predicting a protein’s structural class from its amino acid sequence is a fundamental problem in computational biology. Recent machine learning work in this domain has focused on developing new input space representations for protein sequences, that is, string kernels, some of which give state-of-the-art performance for the binary prediction task of discriminating between one class and all the others. However, the underlying protein classiﬁcation problem is in fact a huge multiclass problem, with over 1000 protein folds and even more structural subcategories organized into a hierarchy. To handle this challenging many-class problem while taking advantage of progress on the binary problem, we introduce an adaptive code approach in the output space of one-vsthe-rest prediction scores. Speciﬁcally, we use a ranking perceptron algorithm to learn a weighting of binary classiﬁers that improves multi-class prediction with respect to a ﬁxed set of output codes. We use a cross-validation set-up to generate output vectors for training, and we deﬁne codes that capture information about the protein structural hierarchy. Our code weighting approach signiﬁcantly improves on the standard one-vs-all method for two difﬁcult multi-class protein classiﬁcation problems: remote homology detection and fold recognition. Our algorithm also outperforms a previous code learning approach due to Crammer and Singer, trained here using a perceptron, when the dimension of the code vectors is high and the number of classes is large. Finally, we compare against PSI-BLAST, one of the most widely used methods in protein sequence analysis, and ﬁnd that our method strongly outperforms it on every structure clas∗.

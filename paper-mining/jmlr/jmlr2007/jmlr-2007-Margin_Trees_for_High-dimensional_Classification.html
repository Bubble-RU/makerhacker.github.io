<p>Author: Saher Esmeir, Shaul Markovitch</p><p>Abstract: The majority of existing algorithms for learning decision trees are greedy—a tree is induced topdown, making locally optimal decisions at each node. In most cases, however, the constructed tree is not globally optimal. Even the few non-greedy learners cannot learn good trees when the concept is difﬁcult. Furthermore, they require a ﬁxed amount of time and are not able to generate a better tree if additional time is available. We introduce a framework for anytime induction of decision trees that overcomes these problems by trading computation speed for better tree quality. Our proposed family of algorithms employs a novel strategy for evaluating candidate splits. A biased sampling of the space of consistent trees rooted at an attribute is used to estimate the size of the minimal tree under that attribute, and an attribute with the smallest expected tree is selected. We present two types of anytime induction algorithms: a contract algorithm that determines the sample size on the basis of a pre-given allocation of time, and an interruptible algorithm that starts with a greedy tree and continuously improves subtrees by additional sampling. Experimental results indicate that, for several hard concepts, our proposed approach exhibits good anytime behavior and yields signiﬁcantly better decision trees when more time is available.

<p>Author: Jia Li, Surajit Ray, Bruce G. Lindsay</p><p>Abstract: A new clustering approach based on mode identiﬁcation is developed by applying new optimization techniques to a nonparametric density estimator. A cluster is formed by those sample points that ascend to the same local maximum (mode) of the density function. The path from a point to its associated mode is efﬁciently solved by an EM-style algorithm, namely, the Modal EM (MEM). This method is then extended for hierarchical clustering by recursively locating modes of kernel density estimators with increasing bandwidths. Without model ﬁtting, the mode-based clustering yields a density description for every cluster, a major advantage of mixture-model-based clustering. Moreover, it ensures that every cluster corresponds to a bump of the density. The issue of diagnosing clustering results is also investigated. Speciﬁcally, a pairwise separability measure for clusters is deﬁned using the ridgeline between the density bumps of two clusters. The ridgeline is solved for by the Ridgeline EM (REM) algorithm, an extension of MEM. Based upon this new measure, a cluster merging procedure is created to enforce strong separation. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate that the mode-based clustering approach tends to combine the strengths of linkage and mixture-model-based clustering. In addition, the approach is robust in high dimensions and when clusters deviate substantially from Gaussian distributions. Both of these cases pose difﬁculty for parametric mixture modeling. A C package on the new algorithms is developed for public access at http://www.stat.psu.edu/∼jiali/hmac.

<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Iftach Nachman, Nir Friedman</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian networks in general, and continuous variable networks in particular, have become increasingly popular in recent years, largely due to advances in methods that facilitate automatic learning from data. Yet, despite these advances, the key task of learning the structure of such models remains a computationally intensive procedure, which limits most applications to parameter learning. This problem is even more acute when learning networks in the presence of missing values or hidden variables, a scenario that is part of many real-life problems. In this work we present a general method for speeding structure search for continuous variable networks with common parametric distributions. We efﬁciently evaluate the approximate merit of candidate structure modiﬁcations and apply time consuming (exact) computations only to the most promising ones, thereby achieving signiﬁcant improvement in the running time of the search algorithm. Our method also naturally and efﬁciently facilitates the addition of useful new hidden variables into the network structure, a task that is typically considered both conceptually difﬁcult and computationally prohibitive. We demonstrate our method on synthetic and real-life data sets, both for learning structure on fully and partially observable data, and for introducing new hidden variables during structure search.

<p>Author: David Mease, Abraham J. Wyner, Andreas Buja</p><p>Abstract: The standard by which binary classiﬁers are usually judged, misclassiﬁcation error, assumes equal costs of misclassifying the two classes or, equivalently, classifying at the 1/2 quantile of the conditional class probability function P[y = 1|x]. Boosted classiﬁcation trees are known to perform quite well for such problems. In this article we consider the use of standard, off-the-shelf boosting for two more general problems: 1) classiﬁcation with unequal costs or, equivalently, classiﬁcation at quantiles other than 1/2, and 2) estimation of the conditional class probability function P[y = 1|x]. We ﬁrst examine whether the latter problem, estimation of P[y = 1|x], can be solved with LogitBoost, and with AdaBoost when combined with a natural link function. The answer is negative: both approaches are often ineffective because they overﬁt P[y = 1|x] even though they perform well as classiﬁers. A major negative point of the present article is the disconnect between class probability estimation and classiﬁcation. Next we consider the practice of over/under-sampling of the two classes. We present an algorithm that uses AdaBoost in conjunction with Over/Under-Sampling and Jittering of the data (“JOUS-Boost”). This algorithm is simple, yet successful, and it preserves the advantage of relative protection against overﬁtting, but for arbitrary misclassiﬁcation costs and, equivalently, arbitrary quantile boundaries. We then use collections of classiﬁers obtained from a grid of quantiles to form estimators of class probabilities. The estimates of the class probabilities compare favorably to those obtained by a variety of methods across both simulated and real data sets.

<p>Author: Sofus A. Macskassy, Foster Provost</p><p>Abstract: paper1 This is about classifying entities that are interlinked with entities for which the class is known. After surveying prior work, we present NetKit, a modular toolkit for classiﬁcation in networked data, and a case-study of its application to networked data used in prior machine learning research. NetKit is based on a node-centric framework in which classiﬁers comprise a local classiﬁer, a relational classiﬁer, and a collective inference procedure. Various existing node-centric relational learning algorithms can be instantiated with appropriate choices for these components, and new combinations of components realize new algorithms. The case study focuses on univariate network classiﬁcation, for which the only information used is the structure of class linkage in the network (i.e., only links and some class labels). To our knowledge, no work previously has evaluated systematically the power of class-linkage alone for classiﬁcation in machine learning benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate that very simple network-classiﬁcation models perform quite well—well enough that they should be used regularly as baseline classiﬁers for studies of learning with networked data. The simplest method (which performs remarkably well) highlights the close correspondence between several existing methods introduced for different purposes—that is, Gaussian-ﬁeld classiﬁers, Hopﬁeld networks, and relational-neighbor classiﬁers. The case study also shows that there are two sets of techniques that are preferable in different situations, namely when few versus many labels are known initially. We also demonstrate that link selection plays an important role similar to traditional feature selection.

<p>Author: Robert Tibshirani, Trevor Hastie</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for the classiﬁcation of more than two classes, from high-dimensional features. Our approach is to build a binary decision tree in a top-down manner, using the optimal margin classiﬁer at each split. We implement an exact greedy algorithm for this task, and compare its performance to less greedy procedures based on clustering of the matrix of pairwise margins. We compare the performance of the “margin tree” to the closely related “all-pairs” (one versus one) support vector machine, and nearest centroids on a number of cancer microarray data sets. We also develop a simple method for feature selection. We ﬁnd that the margin tree has accuracy that is competitive with other methods and offers additional interpretability in its putative grouping of the classes.

<p>Author: Chao-Chun Liu, Dao-Qing Dai, Hong Yan</p><p>Abstract: Face recognition is a challenging problem due to variations in pose, illumination, and expression. Techniques that can provide effective feature representation with enhanced discriminability are crucial. Wavelets have played an important role in image processing for its ability to capture localized spatial-frequency information of images. In this paper, we propose a novel local discriminant coordinates method based on wavelet packet for face recognition to compensate for these variations. Traditional wavelet-based methods for face recognition select or operate on the most discriminant subband, and neglect the scattered characteristic of discriminant features. The proposed method selects the most discriminant coordinates uniformly from all spatial frequency subbands to overcome the deﬁciency of traditional wavelet-based methods. To measure the discriminability of coordinates, a new dilation invariant entropy and a maximum a posterior logistic model are put forward. Moreover, a new triangle square ratio criterion is used to improve classiﬁcation using the Euclidean distance and the cosine criterion. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust for face recognition under variations in illumination, pose and expression.

<p>Author: Miroslav Dudík, Steven J. Phillips, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: We present a uniﬁed and complete account of maximum entropy density estimation subject to constraints represented by convex potential functions or, alternatively, by convex regularization. We provide fully general performance guarantees and an algorithm with a complete convergence proof. As special cases, we easily derive performance guarantees for many known regularization types, including 1 , 2 , 2 , and 1 + 2 style regularization. We propose an algorithm solving a large and 2 2 general subclass of generalized maximum entropy problems, including all discussed in the paper, and prove its convergence. Our approach generalizes and uniﬁes techniques based on information geometry and Bregman divergences as well as those based more directly on compactness. Our work is motivated by a novel application of maximum entropy to species distribution modeling, an important problem in conservation biology and ecology. In a set of experiments on real-world data, we demonstrate the utility of maximum entropy in this setting. We explore effects of different feature types, sample sizes, and regularization levels on the performance of maxent, and discuss interpretability of the resulting models.

<p>Author: Wei Pan, Xiaotong Shen</p><p>Abstract: Variable selection in clustering analysis is both challenging and important. In the context of modelbased clustering analysis with a common diagonal covariance matrix, which is especially suitable for “high dimension, low sample size” settings, we propose a penalized likelihood approach with an L1 penalty function, automatically realizing variable selection via thresholding and delivering a sparse solution. We derive an EM algorithm to ﬁt our proposed model, and propose a modiﬁed BIC as a model selection criterion to choose the number of components and the penalization parameter. A simulation study and an application to gene function prediction with gene expression proﬁles demonstrate the utility of our method.

<p>Author: Saher Esmeir, Shaul Markovitch</p><p>Abstract: The majority of existing algorithms for learning decision trees are greedy—a tree is induced topdown, making locally optimal decisions at each node. In most cases, however, the constructed tree is not globally optimal. Even the few non-greedy learners cannot learn good trees when the concept is difﬁcult. Furthermore, they require a ﬁxed amount of time and are not able to generate a better tree if additional time is available. We introduce a framework for anytime induction of decision trees that overcomes these problems by trading computation speed for better tree quality. Our proposed family of algorithms employs a novel strategy for evaluating candidate splits. A biased sampling of the space of consistent trees rooted at an attribute is used to estimate the size of the minimal tree under that attribute, and an attribute with the smallest expected tree is selected. We present two types of anytime induction algorithms: a contract algorithm that determines the sample size on the basis of a pre-given allocation of time, and an interruptible algorithm that starts with a greedy tree and continuously improves subtrees by additional sampling. Experimental results indicate that, for several hard concepts, our proposed approach exhibits good anytime behavior and yields signiﬁcantly better decision trees when more time is available.

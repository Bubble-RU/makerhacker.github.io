<p>Author: Jia Li, Surajit Ray, Bruce G. Lindsay</p><p>Abstract: A new clustering approach based on mode identiﬁcation is developed by applying new optimization techniques to a nonparametric density estimator. A cluster is formed by those sample points that ascend to the same local maximum (mode) of the density function. The path from a point to its associated mode is efﬁciently solved by an EM-style algorithm, namely, the Modal EM (MEM). This method is then extended for hierarchical clustering by recursively locating modes of kernel density estimators with increasing bandwidths. Without model ﬁtting, the mode-based clustering yields a density description for every cluster, a major advantage of mixture-model-based clustering. Moreover, it ensures that every cluster corresponds to a bump of the density. The issue of diagnosing clustering results is also investigated. Speciﬁcally, a pairwise separability measure for clusters is deﬁned using the ridgeline between the density bumps of two clusters. The ridgeline is solved for by the Ridgeline EM (REM) algorithm, an extension of MEM. Based upon this new measure, a cluster merging procedure is created to enforce strong separation. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate that the mode-based clustering approach tends to combine the strengths of linkage and mixture-model-based clustering. In addition, the approach is robust in high dimensions and when clusters deviate substantially from Gaussian distributions. Both of these cases pose difﬁculty for parametric mixture modeling. A C package on the new algorithms is developed for public access at http://www.stat.psu.edu/∼jiali/hmac.

<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Iftach Nachman, Nir Friedman</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian networks in general, and continuous variable networks in particular, have become increasingly popular in recent years, largely due to advances in methods that facilitate automatic learning from data. Yet, despite these advances, the key task of learning the structure of such models remains a computationally intensive procedure, which limits most applications to parameter learning. This problem is even more acute when learning networks in the presence of missing values or hidden variables, a scenario that is part of many real-life problems. In this work we present a general method for speeding structure search for continuous variable networks with common parametric distributions. We efﬁciently evaluate the approximate merit of candidate structure modiﬁcations and apply time consuming (exact) computations only to the most promising ones, thereby achieving signiﬁcant improvement in the running time of the search algorithm. Our method also naturally and efﬁciently facilitates the addition of useful new hidden variables into the network structure, a task that is typically considered both conceptually difﬁcult and computationally prohibitive. We demonstrate our method on synthetic and real-life data sets, both for learning structure on fully and partially observable data, and for introducing new hidden variables during structure search.

<p>Author: Wei Pan, Xiaotong Shen</p><p>Abstract: Variable selection in clustering analysis is both challenging and important. In the context of modelbased clustering analysis with a common diagonal covariance matrix, which is especially suitable for “high dimension, low sample size” settings, we propose a penalized likelihood approach with an L1 penalty function, automatically realizing variable selection via thresholding and delivering a sparse solution. We derive an EM algorithm to ﬁt our proposed model, and propose a modiﬁed BIC as a model selection criterion to choose the number of components and the penalization parameter. A simulation study and an application to gene function prediction with gene expression proﬁles demonstrate the utility of our method.

<p>Author: Ping Li, Trevor J. Hastie, Kenneth W. Church</p><p>Abstract: For1 dimension reduction in the l1 norm, the method of Cauchy random projections multiplies the original data matrix A ∈ Rn×D with a random matrix R ∈ RD×k (k D) whose entries are i.i.d. samples of the standard Cauchy C(0, 1). Because of the impossibility result, one can not hope to recover the pairwise l1 distances in A from B = A × R ∈ Rn×k , using linear estimators without incurring large errors. However, nonlinear estimators are still useful for certain applications in data stream computations, information retrieval, learning, and data mining. We study three types of nonlinear estimators: the sample median estimators, the geometric mean estimators, and the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE). We derive tail bounds for the geometric mean estimators and establish that k = O log n sufﬁces with the constants explicitly ε2 given. Asymptotically (as k → ∞), both the sample median and the geometric mean estimators are about 80% efﬁcient compared to the MLE. We analyze the moments of the MLE and propose approximating its distribution of by an inverse Gaussian.

<p>Author: Joris M. Mooij, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to improve approximate inference methods by correcting for the inﬂuence of loops in the graphical model. The method is a generalization and alternative implementation of a recent idea from Montanari and Rizzo (2005). It is applicable to arbitrary factor graphs, provided that the size of the Markov blankets is not too large. It consists of two steps: (i) an approximate inference method, for example, belief propagation, is used to approximate cavity distributions for each variable (i.e., probability distributions on the Markov blanket of a variable for a modiﬁed graphical model in which the factors involving that variable have been removed); (ii) all cavity distributions are improved by a message-passing algorithm that cancels out approximation errors by imposing certain consistency constraints. This loop correction (LC) method usually gives signiﬁcantly better results than the original, uncorrected, approximate inference algorithm that is used to estimate the effect of loops. Indeed, we often observe that the loop-corrected error is approximately the square of the error of the uncorrected approximate inference method. In this article, we compare different variants of the loop correction method with other approximate inference methods on a variety of graphical models, including “real world” networks, and conclude that the LC method generally obtains the most accurate results.

<p>Author: Philippe Rigollet</p><p>Abstract: We consider semi-supervised classiﬁcation when part of the available data is unlabeled. These unlabeled data can be useful for the classiﬁcation problem when we make an assumption relating the behavior of the regression function to that of the marginal distribution. Seeger (2000) proposed the well-known cluster assumption as a reasonable one. We propose a mathematical formulation of this assumption and a method based on density level sets estimation that takes advantage of it to achieve fast rates of convergence both in the number of unlabeled examples and the number of labeled examples.

<p>Author: Vicenç Gómez, Joris M. Mooij, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: Recently, Chertkov and Chernyak (2006b) derived an exact expression for the partition sum (normalization constant) corresponding to a graphical model, which is an expansion around the belief propagation (BP) solution. By adding correction terms to the BP free energy, one for each “generalized loop” in the factor graph, the exact partition sum is obtained. However, the usually enormous number of generalized loops generally prohibits summation over all correction terms. In this article we introduce truncated loop series BP (TLSBP), a particular way of truncating the loop series of Chertkov & Chernyak by considering generalized loops as compositions of simple loops. We analyze the performance of TLSBP in different scenarios, including the Ising model on square grids and regular random graphs, and on PROMEDAS, a large probabilistic medical diagnostic system. We show that TLSBP often improves upon the accuracy of the BP solution, at the expense of increased computation time. We also show that the performance of TLSBP strongly depends on the degree of interaction between the variables. For weak interactions, truncating the series leads to signiﬁcant improvements, whereas for strong interactions it can be ineffective, even if a high number of terms is considered.

<p>Author: Jean-Yves Audibert, Olivier Bousquet</p><p>Abstract: There exist many different generalization error bounds in statistical learning theory. Each of these bounds contains an improvement over the others for certain situations or algorithms. Our goal is, ﬁrst, to underline the links between these bounds, and second, to combine the different improvements into a single bound. In particular we combine the PAC-Bayes approach introduced by McAllester (1998), which is interesting for randomized predictions, with the optimal union bound provided by the generic chaining technique developed by Fernique and Talagrand (see Talagrand, 1996), in a way that also takes into account the variance of the combined functions. We also show how this connects to Rademacher based bounds.

<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Mikhail Traskin</p><p>Abstract: The risk, or probability of error, of the classiﬁer produced by the AdaBoost algorithm is investigated. In particular, we consider the stopping strategy to be used in AdaBoost to achieve universal consistency. We show that provided AdaBoost is stopped after n1−ε iterations—for sample size n and ε ∈ (0, 1)—the sequence of risks of the classiﬁers it produces approaches the Bayes risk.

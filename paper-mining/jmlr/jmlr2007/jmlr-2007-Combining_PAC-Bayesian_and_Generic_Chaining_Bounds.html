<p>Author: Sébastien Gadat, Laurent Younes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new model addressing feature selection from a large dictionary of variables that can be computed from a signal or an image. Features are extracted according to an efﬁciency criterion, on the basis of speciﬁed classiﬁcation or recognition tasks. This is done by estimating a probability distribution P on the complete dictionary, which distributes its mass over the more efﬁcient, or informative, components. We implement a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, using the probability as a state variable and optimizing a multi-task goodness of ﬁt criterion for classiﬁers based on variable randomly chosen according to P. We then generate classiﬁers from the optimal distribution of weights learned on the training set. The method is ﬁrst tested on several pattern recognition problems including face detection, handwritten digit recognition, spam classiﬁcation and micro-array analysis. We then compare our approach with other step-wise algorithms like random forests or recursive feature elimination.

<p>Author: Zakria Hussain, François Laviolette, Mario Marchand, John Shawe-Taylor, Spencer Charles Brubaker, Matthew D. Mullin</p><p>Abstract: Marchand and Shawe-Taylor (2002) have proposed a loss bound for the set covering machine that has the property to depend on the observed fraction of positive examples and on what the classiﬁer achieves on the positive training examples. We show that this loss bound is incorrect. We then propose a loss bound, valid for any sample-compression learning algorithm (including the set covering machine), that depends on the observed fraction of positive examples and on what the classiﬁer achieves on them. We also compare numerically the loss bound proposed in this paper with the incorrect bound, the original SCM bound and a recently proposed loss bound of Marchand and Sokolova (2005) (which does not depend on the observed fraction of positive examples) and show that the latter loss bounds can be substantially larger than the new bound in the presence of imbalanced misclassiﬁcations.

<p>Author: Avrim Blum, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: External regret compares the performance of an online algorithm, selecting among N actions, to the performance of the best of those actions in hindsight. Internal regret compares the loss of an online algorithm to the loss of a modiﬁed online algorithm, which consistently replaces one action by another. In this paper we give a simple generic reduction that, given an algorithm for the external regret problem, converts it to an efﬁcient online algorithm for the internal regret problem. We provide methods that work both in the full information model, in which the loss of every action is observed at each time step, and the partial information (bandit) model, where at each time step only the loss of the selected action is observed. The importance of internal regret in game theory is due to the fact that in a general game, if each player has sublinear internal regret, then the empirical frequencies converge to a correlated equilibrium. For external regret we also derive a quantitative regret bound for a very general setting of regret, which includes an arbitrary set of modiﬁcation rules (that possibly modify the online algorithm) and an arbitrary set of time selection functions (each giving different weight to each time step). The regret for a given time selection and modiﬁcation rule is the difference between the cost of the online algorithm and the cost of the modiﬁed online algorithm, where the costs are weighted by the time selection function. This can be viewed as a generalization of the previously-studied sleeping experts setting.

<p>Author: Yiming Ying, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances provide a rich family of Mercer kernels for learning algorithms. We show that the union of the unit balls of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces generated by Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli (uGC) class. This result conﬁrms a conjecture concerning learnability of Gaussian kernels and veriﬁes the uniform convergence of many learning algorithms involving Gaussians with changing variances. Rademacher averages and empirical covering numbers are used to estimate sample errors of multi-kernel regularization schemes associated with general loss functions. It is then shown that the regularization error associated with the least square loss and the Gaussian kernels can be greatly improved when ﬂexible variances are allowed. Finally, for regularization schemes generated by Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances we present explicit learning rates for regression with least square loss and classiﬁcation with hinge loss.

<p>Author: Ambuj Tewari, Peter L. Bartlett</p><p>Abstract: Binary classiﬁcation is a well studied special case of the classiﬁcation problem. Statistical properties of binary classiﬁers, such as consistency, have been investigated in a variety of settings. Binary classiﬁcation methods can be generalized in many ways to handle multiple classes. It turns out that one can lose consistency in generalizing a binary classiﬁcation method to deal with multiple classes. We study a rich family of multiclass methods and provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for their consistency. We illustrate our approach by applying it to some multiclass methods proposed in the literature.

<p>Author: Jean-Yves Audibert, Olivier Bousquet</p><p>Abstract: There exist many different generalization error bounds in statistical learning theory. Each of these bounds contains an improvement over the others for certain situations or algorithms. Our goal is, ﬁrst, to underline the links between these bounds, and second, to combine the different improvements into a single bound. In particular we combine the PAC-Bayes approach introduced by McAllester (1998), which is interesting for randomized predictions, with the optimal union bound provided by the generic chaining technique developed by Fernique and Talagrand (see Talagrand, 1996), in a way that also takes into account the variance of the combined functions. We also show how this connects to Rademacher based bounds.

<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Mikhail Traskin</p><p>Abstract: The risk, or probability of error, of the classiﬁer produced by the AdaBoost algorithm is investigated. In particular, we consider the stopping strategy to be used in AdaBoost to achieve universal consistency. We show that provided AdaBoost is stopped after n1−ε iterations—for sample size n and ε ∈ (0, 1)—the sequence of risks of the classiﬁers it produces approaches the Bayes risk.

<p>Author: Yiming Ying, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances provide a rich family of Mercer kernels for learning algorithms. We show that the union of the unit balls of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces generated by Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli (uGC) class. This result conﬁrms a conjecture concerning learnability of Gaussian kernels and veriﬁes the uniform convergence of many learning algorithms involving Gaussians with changing variances. Rademacher averages and empirical covering numbers are used to estimate sample errors of multi-kernel regularization schemes associated with general loss functions. It is then shown that the regularization error associated with the least square loss and the Gaussian kernels can be greatly improved when ﬂexible variances are allowed. Finally, for regularization schemes generated by Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances we present explicit learning rates for regression with least square loss and classiﬁcation with hinge loss.

<p>Author: Philippe Rigollet</p><p>Abstract: We consider semi-supervised classiﬁcation when part of the available data is unlabeled. These unlabeled data can be useful for the classiﬁcation problem when we make an assumption relating the behavior of the regression function to that of the marginal distribution. Seeger (2000) proposed the well-known cluster assumption as a reasonable one. We propose a mathematical formulation of this assumption and a method based on density level sets estimation that takes advantage of it to achieve fast rates of convergence both in the number of unlabeled examples and the number of labeled examples.

<p>Author: François Laviolette, Mario Marchand</p><p>Abstract: We propose a PAC-Bayes theorem for the sample-compression setting where each classiﬁer is described by a compression subset of the training data and a message string of additional information. This setting, which is the appropriate one to describe many learning algorithms, strictly generalizes the usual data-independent setting where classiﬁers are represented only by data-independent message strings (or parameters taken from a continuous set). The proposed PAC-Bayes theorem for the sample-compression setting reduces to the PAC-Bayes theorem of Seeger (2002) and Langford (2005) when the compression subset of each classiﬁer vanishes. For posteriors having all their weights on a single sample-compressed classiﬁer, the general risk bound reduces to a bound similar to the tight sample-compression bound proposed in Laviolette et al. (2005). Finally, we extend our results to the case where each sample-compressed classiﬁer of a data-dependent ensemble may abstain of predicting a class label.

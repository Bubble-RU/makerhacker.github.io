<p>Author: Jia Li, Surajit Ray, Bruce G. Lindsay</p><p>Abstract: A new clustering approach based on mode identiﬁcation is developed by applying new optimization techniques to a nonparametric density estimator. A cluster is formed by those sample points that ascend to the same local maximum (mode) of the density function. The path from a point to its associated mode is efﬁciently solved by an EM-style algorithm, namely, the Modal EM (MEM). This method is then extended for hierarchical clustering by recursively locating modes of kernel density estimators with increasing bandwidths. Without model ﬁtting, the mode-based clustering yields a density description for every cluster, a major advantage of mixture-model-based clustering. Moreover, it ensures that every cluster corresponds to a bump of the density. The issue of diagnosing clustering results is also investigated. Speciﬁcally, a pairwise separability measure for clusters is deﬁned using the ridgeline between the density bumps of two clusters. The ridgeline is solved for by the Ridgeline EM (REM) algorithm, an extension of MEM. Based upon this new measure, a cluster merging procedure is created to enforce strong separation. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate that the mode-based clustering approach tends to combine the strengths of linkage and mixture-model-based clustering. In addition, the approach is robust in high dimensions and when clusters deviate substantially from Gaussian distributions. Both of these cases pose difﬁculty for parametric mixture modeling. A C package on the new algorithms is developed for public access at http://www.stat.psu.edu/∼jiali/hmac.

<p>Author: Wei Pan, Xiaotong Shen</p><p>Abstract: Variable selection in clustering analysis is both challenging and important. In the context of modelbased clustering analysis with a common diagonal covariance matrix, which is especially suitable for “high dimension, low sample size” settings, we propose a penalized likelihood approach with an L1 penalty function, automatically realizing variable selection via thresholding and delivering a sparse solution. We derive an EM algorithm to ﬁt our proposed model, and propose a modiﬁed BIC as a model selection criterion to choose the number of components and the penalization parameter. A simulation study and an application to gene function prediction with gene expression proﬁles demonstrate the utility of our method.

<p>Author: Marco Loog</p><p>Abstract: Recently, Ye (2005) suggested yet another optimization criterion for discriminant analysis and proposed a characterization of the family of solutions to this objective. The characterization, however, merely describes a part of the full solution set, that is, it is not complete and therefore not at all a characterization. This correspondence ﬁrst gives the correct characterization and afterwards compares it to Ye’s. Keywords: linear discriminant analysis, Fisher criterion, small sample, characterization 1. Classical and New Criteria Given N feature vectors of dimensionality n, a linear reduction of dimensionality, based on classical Fisher LDA, determines an n × d transformation matrix L that, for a given d < K, K the number of classes, maximizes the so-called Fisher criterion: F(A) = tr((A t SW A)−1 (At SB A)) or, equivalently, F0 (A) = tr((At ST A)−1 (At SB A)). Here, SB := ∑K pi (mi − m)(mi − m)t , SW := ∑K pi Si , and i=1 i=1 ST = SB + SW . The matrices SB , SW , and ST are the so-called between-class, pooled within-class, and total covariance matrices. In addition, mi is the mean vector of class i, pi is the prior of class i, and the overall mean m equals ∑k pi mi . Finally, Si is the covariance matrix of class i. i=1 A solution to these optimization problems can be obtained by means of a generalized eigenvalue decomposition, which Fukunaga (1990) relates to a simultaneous diagonalization of the two matrices involved (see also Campbell and Atchley, 1981). More common is it to apply a standard −1 eigenvalue decomposition to S−1 SB (or SW SB ), resulting in an equivalent set of eigenvectors. The d T columns of the optimal solution L are simply taken to equal the d eigenvectors corresponding to the d largest eigenvalues. It is known that this solution is not unique and the full class can be obtained by multiplying L to the right with nonsingular d × d matrices (see Fukunaga, 1990). Clearly, if the total covariance ST is singular, neither the generalized nor the standard eigenvalue decomposition can be readily employed. Directly or indirectly, the problem is that the matrix inverse S−1 does not exist, which is the typical situation when dealing with small samples. In an attempt to T overcome this problem, Ye (2005) introduced a different criterion that is deﬁned as F1 (A) = tr((At ST A)+ (At SB A)) , ∗. Also at Nordic Bioscience Imaging, Hovegade 207, DK-2730 Herlev, Denmark. c 2007 Marco Loog. (1) L OOG where + denotes taking the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of a matrix. Like for F0 , an optimal transform L is one that maximizes the objective F1 . Again, this solution is not unique. 2. Correct Characterization For the full characterization of the set of solutions to Equation (1), initially the problem is looked at from a geometrical point of view (cf., Campbell and Atchley, 1981). It is assumed that the number of samples N is smaller than or equal to the feature dimensionality n. In the undersampled case, it is clear that all data variation occurs in an N − 1-dimensional subspace of the original space. To start with, a PCA of the data is carried out and the ﬁrst N − 1 principal components are rotated to the ﬁrst N − 1 axes of the n-dimensional space by means of a rotation matrix R. This matrix consists of all (normalized) eigenvectors of ST taken as its columns. After this rotation, new total and between-class covariance matrices, ST = Rt ST R and SB = Rt SB R, are obtained. These 0 0 matrices can be partitioned as follows: ST = Σ0T 0 and SB = ΣB 0 , where ΣT and ΣB are N − 1 × 0 N − 1 covariance matrices and ΣT is nonsingular and diagonal by construction. The between-class variation is obviously restricted to the N − 1-dimensional subspace in which the total data variation takes place, therefore a same partitioning of SB is possible. However, the covariance submatrix ΣB is not necessarily diagonal, neither does it have to be nonsingular. Basically, the PCA-based rotation R converts the initial problem into a more convenient one, splitting up the original space in an N − 1-dimensional one in which “everything interesting” takes place and a remaining n − N + 1dimensional subspace in which “nothing happens at all”. Now consider F1 in this transformed space and take a general n × d transformation matrix A, which is partitioned in a way similar to the covariance matrices, that is, X . Y A= (2) Here, X is an N − 1 × d-matrix and Y is of size n − N + 1 × d. Taking this deﬁnition, the following holds (cf., Ye, 2005): t + t F1 (A) = tr((A ST A) (A SB A)) = tr =tr X t ΣT X 0 0 0 + X Y X t ΣB X 0 0 0 t ΣT 0 = tr 0 0 X Y + (Xt ΣT X)−1 0 0 0 X Y t ΣB 0 0 0 X Y X t ΣB X 0 0 0 = tr((Xt ΣT X)−1 (Xt ΣB X)) = F0 (X) . From this it is immediate that a matrix A maximizes F1 if and only if the submatrix X maximizes the original Fisher criterion in the lower-dimensional subspace. Moreover, if L is such a matrix maximizing F1 in the PCA-transformed space, it is easy to check that R−1 L = Rt L provides a solution to the original, general problem that has not been preprocessed by means of a PCA (see also Fukunaga, 1990). A characterization of the complete family of solutions can now be given. Let Λ ∈ RN−1×d be an optimal solution of F0 (X) = tr((Xt ΣT X)−1 (Xt ΣB X)). As already noted in Section 1, the full set of solutions is given by F = {ΛZ ∈ RN−1×d | Z ∈ GLd (R)}, where GLd (R) denotes the general linear group of d × d invertible matrices. The previous paragraph essentially demonstrates that if X ∈ F , A in Equation (2) maximizes F1 . The matrix Y can be chosen ad 2122 C OMPLETE C HARACTERIZATION OF A FAMILY OF S OLUTIONS libitum. Now, the latter provides the solution in the PCA-transformed space and to solve the general problem we need to take the rotation back to the original space into account. All in all, this leads to the following complete family of solutions L , maximizing F1 in the original space: L = Rt ΛZ ∈ Rn×d Z ∈ GLd (R), Y ∈ Rn−N+1×d Y , (3) where Λ = argmaxX tr((Xt ΣT X)−1 (Xt ΣB X)) and Rt takes care of the rotation back. 3. Original Characterization Though not noted by Ye (2005), his attempt to characterize the full set of solutions of Equation (1) is based on a simultaneous diagonalization of the three covariance matrices S B , SW , and ST that is similar to the ideas described by Campbell and Atchley (1981) and Fukunaga (1990). Moreover, Golub and Van Loan (Theorem 8.7.1. 1996) can be readily applied to demonstrate that such simultaneous diagonalization is possible in the small sample setting. After the diagonalization step, partitioned between-class, pooled within-class, and total covariance matrices are considered. This partitioning is similar to the one employed in the previous section, which does not enforce matrices to be diagonal however. In the subsequent optimization step, the classical Fisher criterion is maximized basically in the appropriate subspace, comparable to the approach described above, but in a mildly more involved and concealed way. For this, matrices of the form Rt X are considered, consider Equations (2) and Y (3). However, Y is simply the null matrix and the family of solutions L provided is limited to L = Rt ΛZ ∈ Rn×d Z ∈ GLd (R) . 0 Obviously, this is far from a complete characterization, especially when N − 1 n which is, for instance, typically the case for the data sets considered by Ye (2005). Generally, the utility of a dimensionality reduction criterion, without additional constrains, depends on the efﬁciency over the full set of solutions. As Ye (2005) only considers two very speciﬁc instances from the large class of possibilities, it is unclear to what extent the new criterion really provides an efﬁcient way of performing a reduction of dimensionality.

We show that several well known and more recent center-based clustering algorithms, which have been derived either heuristically, or/and have emerged from intuitive analogies in physics, statistical techniques and information theoretic perspectives can be recovered as special cases of the proposed analysis and we streamline their relationships.

<p>Author: Santosh Srivastava, Maya R. Gupta, Béla A. Frigyik</p><p>Abstract: Quadratic discriminant analysis is a common tool for classiﬁcation, but estimation of the Gaussian parameters can be ill-posed. This paper contains theoretical and algorithmic contributions to Bayesian estimation for quadratic discriminant analysis. A distribution-based Bayesian classiﬁer is derived using information geometry. Using a calculus of variations approach to deﬁne a functional Bregman divergence for distributions, it is shown that the Bayesian distribution-based classiﬁer that minimizes the expected Bregman divergence of each class conditional distribution also minimizes the expected misclassiﬁcation cost. A series approximation is used to relate regularized discriminant analysis to Bayesian discriminant analysis. A new Bayesian quadratic discriminant analysis classiﬁer is proposed where the prior is deﬁned using a coarse estimate of the covariance based on the training data; this classiﬁer is termed BDA7. Results on benchmark data sets and simulations show that BDA7 performance is competitive with, and in some cases signiﬁcantly better than, regularized quadratic discriminant analysis and the cross-validated Bayesian quadratic discriminant analysis classiﬁer Quadratic Bayes.

<p>Author: Jia Li, Surajit Ray, Bruce G. Lindsay</p><p>Abstract: A new clustering approach based on mode identiﬁcation is developed by applying new optimization techniques to a nonparametric density estimator. A cluster is formed by those sample points that ascend to the same local maximum (mode) of the density function. The path from a point to its associated mode is efﬁciently solved by an EM-style algorithm, namely, the Modal EM (MEM). This method is then extended for hierarchical clustering by recursively locating modes of kernel density estimators with increasing bandwidths. Without model ﬁtting, the mode-based clustering yields a density description for every cluster, a major advantage of mixture-model-based clustering. Moreover, it ensures that every cluster corresponds to a bump of the density. The issue of diagnosing clustering results is also investigated. Speciﬁcally, a pairwise separability measure for clusters is deﬁned using the ridgeline between the density bumps of two clusters. The ridgeline is solved for by the Ridgeline EM (REM) algorithm, an extension of MEM. Based upon this new measure, a cluster merging procedure is created to enforce strong separation. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate that the mode-based clustering approach tends to combine the strengths of linkage and mixture-model-based clustering. In addition, the approach is robust in high dimensions and when clusters deviate substantially from Gaussian distributions. Both of these cases pose difﬁculty for parametric mixture modeling. A C package on the new algorithms is developed for public access at http://www.stat.psu.edu/∼jiali/hmac.

<p>Author: Marco Loog</p><p>Abstract: Recently, Ye (2005) suggested yet another optimization criterion for discriminant analysis and proposed a characterization of the family of solutions to this objective. The characterization, however, merely describes a part of the full solution set, that is, it is not complete and therefore not at all a characterization. This correspondence ﬁrst gives the correct characterization and afterwards compares it to Ye’s. Keywords: linear discriminant analysis, Fisher criterion, small sample, characterization 1. Classical and New Criteria Given N feature vectors of dimensionality n, a linear reduction of dimensionality, based on classical Fisher LDA, determines an n × d transformation matrix L that, for a given d < K, K the number of classes, maximizes the so-called Fisher criterion: F(A) = tr((A t SW A)−1 (At SB A)) or, equivalently, F0 (A) = tr((At ST A)−1 (At SB A)). Here, SB := ∑K pi (mi − m)(mi − m)t , SW := ∑K pi Si , and i=1 i=1 ST = SB + SW . The matrices SB , SW , and ST are the so-called between-class, pooled within-class, and total covariance matrices. In addition, mi is the mean vector of class i, pi is the prior of class i, and the overall mean m equals ∑k pi mi . Finally, Si is the covariance matrix of class i. i=1 A solution to these optimization problems can be obtained by means of a generalized eigenvalue decomposition, which Fukunaga (1990) relates to a simultaneous diagonalization of the two matrices involved (see also Campbell and Atchley, 1981). More common is it to apply a standard −1 eigenvalue decomposition to S−1 SB (or SW SB ), resulting in an equivalent set of eigenvectors. The d T columns of the optimal solution L are simply taken to equal the d eigenvectors corresponding to the d largest eigenvalues. It is known that this solution is not unique and the full class can be obtained by multiplying L to the right with nonsingular d × d matrices (see Fukunaga, 1990). Clearly, if the total covariance ST is singular, neither the generalized nor the standard eigenvalue decomposition can be readily employed. Directly or indirectly, the problem is that the matrix inverse S−1 does not exist, which is the typical situation when dealing with small samples. In an attempt to T overcome this problem, Ye (2005) introduced a different criterion that is deﬁned as F1 (A) = tr((At ST A)+ (At SB A)) , ∗. Also at Nordic Bioscience Imaging, Hovegade 207, DK-2730 Herlev, Denmark. c 2007 Marco Loog. (1) L OOG where + denotes taking the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of a matrix. Like for F0 , an optimal transform L is one that maximizes the objective F1 . Again, this solution is not unique. 2. Correct Characterization For the full characterization of the set of solutions to Equation (1), initially the problem is looked at from a geometrical point of view (cf., Campbell and Atchley, 1981). It is assumed that the number of samples N is smaller than or equal to the feature dimensionality n. In the undersampled case, it is clear that all data variation occurs in an N − 1-dimensional subspace of the original space. To start with, a PCA of the data is carried out and the ﬁrst N − 1 principal components are rotated to the ﬁrst N − 1 axes of the n-dimensional space by means of a rotation matrix R. This matrix consists of all (normalized) eigenvectors of ST taken as its columns. After this rotation, new total and between-class covariance matrices, ST = Rt ST R and SB = Rt SB R, are obtained. These 0 0 matrices can be partitioned as follows: ST = Σ0T 0 and SB = ΣB 0 , where ΣT and ΣB are N − 1 × 0 N − 1 covariance matrices and ΣT is nonsingular and diagonal by construction. The between-class variation is obviously restricted to the N − 1-dimensional subspace in which the total data variation takes place, therefore a same partitioning of SB is possible. However, the covariance submatrix ΣB is not necessarily diagonal, neither does it have to be nonsingular. Basically, the PCA-based rotation R converts the initial problem into a more convenient one, splitting up the original space in an N − 1-dimensional one in which “everything interesting” takes place and a remaining n − N + 1dimensional subspace in which “nothing happens at all”. Now consider F1 in this transformed space and take a general n × d transformation matrix A, which is partitioned in a way similar to the covariance matrices, that is, X . Y A= (2) Here, X is an N − 1 × d-matrix and Y is of size n − N + 1 × d. Taking this deﬁnition, the following holds (cf., Ye, 2005): t + t F1 (A) = tr((A ST A) (A SB A)) = tr =tr X t ΣT X 0 0 0 + X Y X t ΣB X 0 0 0 t ΣT 0 = tr 0 0 X Y + (Xt ΣT X)−1 0 0 0 X Y t ΣB 0 0 0 X Y X t ΣB X 0 0 0 = tr((Xt ΣT X)−1 (Xt ΣB X)) = F0 (X) . From this it is immediate that a matrix A maximizes F1 if and only if the submatrix X maximizes the original Fisher criterion in the lower-dimensional subspace. Moreover, if L is such a matrix maximizing F1 in the PCA-transformed space, it is easy to check that R−1 L = Rt L provides a solution to the original, general problem that has not been preprocessed by means of a PCA (see also Fukunaga, 1990). A characterization of the complete family of solutions can now be given. Let Λ ∈ RN−1×d be an optimal solution of F0 (X) = tr((Xt ΣT X)−1 (Xt ΣB X)). As already noted in Section 1, the full set of solutions is given by F = {ΛZ ∈ RN−1×d | Z ∈ GLd (R)}, where GLd (R) denotes the general linear group of d × d invertible matrices. The previous paragraph essentially demonstrates that if X ∈ F , A in Equation (2) maximizes F1 . The matrix Y can be chosen ad 2122 C OMPLETE C HARACTERIZATION OF A FAMILY OF S OLUTIONS libitum. Now, the latter provides the solution in the PCA-transformed space and to solve the general problem we need to take the rotation back to the original space into account. All in all, this leads to the following complete family of solutions L , maximizing F1 in the original space: L = Rt ΛZ ∈ Rn×d Z ∈ GLd (R), Y ∈ Rn−N+1×d Y , (3) where Λ = argmaxX tr((Xt ΣT X)−1 (Xt ΣB X)) and Rt takes care of the rotation back. 3. Original Characterization Though not noted by Ye (2005), his attempt to characterize the full set of solutions of Equation (1) is based on a simultaneous diagonalization of the three covariance matrices S B , SW , and ST that is similar to the ideas described by Campbell and Atchley (1981) and Fukunaga (1990). Moreover, Golub and Van Loan (Theorem 8.7.1. 1996) can be readily applied to demonstrate that such simultaneous diagonalization is possible in the small sample setting. After the diagonalization step, partitioned between-class, pooled within-class, and total covariance matrices are considered. This partitioning is similar to the one employed in the previous section, which does not enforce matrices to be diagonal however. In the subsequent optimization step, the classical Fisher criterion is maximized basically in the appropriate subspace, comparable to the approach described above, but in a mildly more involved and concealed way. For this, matrices of the form Rt X are considered, consider Equations (2) and Y (3). However, Y is simply the null matrix and the family of solutions L provided is limited to L = Rt ΛZ ∈ Rn×d Z ∈ GLd (R) . 0 Obviously, this is far from a complete characterization, especially when N − 1 n which is, for instance, typically the case for the data sets considered by Ye (2005). Generally, the utility of a dimensionality reduction criterion, without additional constrains, depends on the efﬁciency over the full set of solutions. As Ye (2005) only considers two very speciﬁc instances from the large class of possibilities, it is unclear to what extent the new criterion really provides an efﬁcient way of performing a reduction of dimensionality.

<p>Author: Arindam Banerjee, Inderjit Dhillon, Joydeep Ghosh, Srujana Merugu, Dharmendra S. Modha</p><p>Abstract: Co-clustering, or simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a two-dimensional data matrix, is rapidly becoming a powerful data analysis technique. Co-clustering has enjoyed wide success in varied application domains such as text clustering, gene-microarray analysis, natural language processing and image, speech and video analysis. In this paper, we introduce a partitional co-clustering formulation that is driven by the search for a good matrix approximation—every co-clustering is associated with an approximation of the original data matrix and the quality of co-clustering is determined by the approximation error. We allow the approximation error to be measured using a large class of loss functions called Bregman divergences that include squared Euclidean distance and KL-divergence as special cases. In addition, we permit multiple structurally different co-clustering schemes that preserve various linear statistics of the original data matrix. To accomplish the above tasks, we introduce a new minimum Bregman information (MBI) principle that simultaneously generalizes the maximum entropy and standard least squares principles, and leads to a matrix approximation that is optimal among all generalized additive models in a certain natural parameter space. Analysis based on this principle yields an elegant meta algorithm, special cases of which include most previously known alternate minimization based clustering algorithms such as kmeans and co-clustering algorithms such as information theoretic (Dhillon et al., 2003b) and minimum sum-squared residue co-clustering (Cho et al., 2004). To demonstrate the generality and ﬂexibility of our co-clustering framework, we provide examples and empirical evidence on a varic 2007 Arindam Banerjee, Inderjit S.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Philip M. Long, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning multiple tasks in parallel within the online learning framework. On each online round, the algorithm receives an instance for each of the parallel tasks and responds by predicting the label of each instance. We consider the case where the predictions made on each round all contribute toward a common goal. The relationship between the various tasks is deﬁned by a global loss function, which evaluates the overall quality of the multiple predictions made on each round. Speciﬁcally, each individual prediction is associated with its own loss value, and then these multiple loss values are combined into a single number using the global loss function. We focus on the case where the global loss function belongs to the family of absolute norms, and present several online learning algorithms for the induced problem. We prove worst-case relative loss bounds for all of our algorithms, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a largescale multiclass-multilabel text categorization problem.

This representation uses local smoothing to embed documents as smooth curves in the multinomial simplex thereby preserving valuable sequential information. In contrast to bag of words or n-grams, the new representation is able to robustly capture medium and long range sequential trends in the document.

<p>Author: Amir Globerson, Gal Chechik, Fernando Pereira, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Embedding algorithms search for a low dimensional continuous representation of data, but most algorithms only handle objects of a single type for which pairwise distances are speciﬁed. This paper describes a method for embedding objects of different types, such as images and text, into a single common Euclidean space, based on their co-occurrence statistics. The joint distributions are modeled as exponentials of Euclidean distances in the low-dimensional embedding space, which links the problem to convex optimization over positive semideﬁnite matrices. The local structure of the embedding corresponds to the statistical correlations via random walks in the Euclidean space.

We consider the problem of deﬁning the distance between two data sets by comparing summary statistics computed from the data sets.

We show that this distance can be computed in cubic time and that it has several intuitive properties. We also show that this distance is the unique Mahalanobis distance satisfying certain assumptions. We also demonstrate that if we are dealing with binary data sets, then the distance can be represented naturally by certain parity functions, and that it can be evaluated in linear time.

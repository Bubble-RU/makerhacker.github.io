<p>Author: Vicenç Gómez, Joris M. Mooij, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: Recently, Chertkov and Chernyak (2006b) derived an exact expression for the partition sum (normalization constant) corresponding to a graphical model, which is an expansion around the belief propagation (BP) solution. By adding correction terms to the BP free energy, one for each “generalized loop” in the factor graph, the exact partition sum is obtained. However, the usually enormous number of generalized loops generally prohibits summation over all correction terms. In this article we introduce truncated loop series BP (TLSBP), a particular way of truncating the loop series of Chertkov & Chernyak by considering generalized loops as compositions of simple loops. We analyze the performance of TLSBP in different scenarios, including the Ising model on square grids and regular random graphs, and on PROMEDAS, a large probabilistic medical diagnostic system. We show that TLSBP often improves upon the accuracy of the BP solution, at the expense of increased computation time. We also show that the performance of TLSBP strongly depends on the degree of interaction between the variables. For weak interactions, truncating the series leads to signiﬁcant improvements, whereas for strong interactions it can be ineffective, even if a high number of terms is considered.

<p>Author: Joris M. Mooij, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to improve approximate inference methods by correcting for the inﬂuence of loops in the graphical model. The method is a generalization and alternative implementation of a recent idea from Montanari and Rizzo (2005). It is applicable to arbitrary factor graphs, provided that the size of the Markov blankets is not too large. It consists of two steps: (i) an approximate inference method, for example, belief propagation, is used to approximate cavity distributions for each variable (i.e., probability distributions on the Markov blanket of a variable for a modiﬁed graphical model in which the factors involving that variable have been removed); (ii) all cavity distributions are improved by a message-passing algorithm that cancels out approximation errors by imposing certain consistency constraints. This loop correction (LC) method usually gives signiﬁcantly better results than the original, uncorrected, approximate inference algorithm that is used to estimate the effect of loops. Indeed, we often observe that the loop-corrected error is approximately the square of the error of the uncorrected approximate inference method. In this article, we compare different variants of the loop correction method with other approximate inference methods on a variety of graphical models, including “real world” networks, and conclude that the LC method generally obtains the most accurate results.

<p>Author: Nikolas List, Hans Ulrich Simon</p><p>Abstract: We present a general decomposition algorithm that is uniformly applicable to every (suitably normalized) instance of Convex Quadratic Optimization and efﬁciently approaches an optimal solution. The number of iterations required to be within ε of optimality grows linearly with 1/ε and quadratically with the number m of variables. The working set selection can be performed in polynomial time. If we restrict our considerations to instances of Convex Quadratic Optimization with at most k0 equality constraints for some ﬁxed constant k0 plus some so-called box-constraints (conditions that hold for most variants of SVM-optimization), the working set is found in linear time. Our analysis builds on a generalization of the concept of rate certifying pairs that was introduced by Hush and Scovel. In order to extend their results to arbitrary instances of Convex Quadratic Optimization, we introduce the general notion of a rate certifying q-set. We improve on the results by Hush and Scovel (2003) in several ways. First our result holds for Convex Quadratic Optimization whereas the results by Hush and Scovel are specialized to SVM-optimization. Second, we achieve a higher rate of convergence even for the special case of SVM-optimization (despite the generality of our approach). Third, our analysis is technically simpler. We prove furthermore that the strategy for working set selection which is based on rate certifying sets coincides with a strategy which is based on a so-called “sparse witness of sub-optimality”. Viewed from this perspective, our main result improves on convergence results by List and Simon (2004) and Simon (2004) by providing convergence rates (and by holding under more general conditions).

<p>Author: Shantanu Chakrabartty, Gert Cauwenberghs</p><p>Abstract: Many classiﬁcation tasks require estimation of output class probabilities for use as conﬁdence scores or for inference integrated with other models. Probability estimates derived from large margin classiﬁers such as support vector machines (SVMs) are often unreliable. We extend SVM large margin classiﬁcation to GiniSVM maximum entropy multi-class probability regression. GiniSVM combines a quadratic (Gini-Simpson) entropy based agnostic model with a kernel based similarity model. A form of Huber loss in the GiniSVM primal formulation elucidates a connection to robust estimation, further corroborated by the impulsive noise ﬁltering property of the reverse water-ﬁlling procedure to arrive at normalized classiﬁcation margins. The GiniSVM normalized classiﬁcation margins directly provide estimates of class conditional probabilities, approximating kernel logistic regression (KLR) but at reduced computational cost. As with other SVMs, GiniSVM produces a sparse kernel expansion and is trained by solving a quadratic program under linear constraints. GiniSVM training is efﬁciently implemented by sequential minimum optimization or by growth transformation on probability functions. Results on synthetic and benchmark data, including speaker veriﬁcation and face detection data, show improved classiﬁcation performance and increased tolerance to imprecision over soft-margin SVM and KLR.

<p>Author: Michael Biehl, Anarta Ghosh, Barbara Hammer</p><p>Abstract: Learning vector quantization (LVQ) schemes constitute intuitive, powerful classiﬁcation heuristics with numerous successful applications but, so far, limited theoretical background. We study LVQ rigorously within a simplifying model situation: two competing prototypes are trained from a sequence of examples drawn from a mixture of Gaussians. Concepts from statistical physics and the theory of on-line learning allow for an exact description of the training dynamics in highdimensional feature space. The analysis yields typical learning curves, convergence properties, and achievable generalization abilities. This is also possible for heuristic training schemes which do not relate to a cost function. We compare the performance of several algorithms, including Kohonen’s LVQ1 and LVQ+/-, a limiting case of LVQ2.1. The former shows close to optimal performance, while LVQ+/- displays divergent behavior. We investigate how early stopping can overcome this difﬁculty. Furthermore, we study a crisp version of robust soft LVQ, which was recently derived from a statistical formulation. Surprisingly, it exhibits relatively poor generalization. Performance improves if a window for the selection of data is introduced; the resulting algorithm corresponds to cost function based LVQ2. The dependence of these results on the model parameters, for example, prior class probabilities, is investigated systematically, simulations conﬁrm our analytical ﬁndings.

<p>Author: Moshe Koppel, Jonathan Schler, Elisheva Bonchek-Dokow</p><p>Abstract: In the authorship verification problem, we are given examples of the writing of a single author and are asked to determine if given long texts were or were not written by this author. We present a new learning-based method for adducing the “depth of difference” between two example sets and offer evidence that this method solves the authorship verification problem with very high accuracy. The underlying idea is to test the rate of degradation of the accuracy of learned models as the best features are iteratively dropped from the learning process.

<p>Author: Marlon Núñez, Raúl Fidalgo, Rafael Morales</p><p>Abstract: In the process of concept learning, target concepts may have portions with short-term changes, other portions may support long-term changes, and yet others may not change at all. For this reason several local windows need to be handled. We suggest facing this problem, which naturally exists in the ﬁeld of concept learning, by allocating windows which can adapt their size to portions of the target concept. We propose an incremental decision tree that is updated with incoming examples. Each leaf of the decision tree holds a time window and a local performance measure as the main parameter to be controlled. When the performance of a leaf decreases, the size of its local window is reduced. This learning algorithm, called OnlineTree2, automatically adjusts its internal parameters in order to face the current dynamics of the data stream. Results show that it is comparable to other batch algorithms when facing problems with no concept change, and it is better than evaluated methods in its ability to deal with concept drift when dealing with problems in which: concept change occurs at different speeds, noise may be present and, examples may arrive from different areas of the problem domain (virtual drift).

<p>Author: Gaëlle Loosli, Stéphane Canu</p><p>Abstract: In a recently published paper in JMLR, Tsang et al. (2005) present an algorithm for SVM called Core Vector Machines (CVM) and illustrate its performances through comparisons with other SVM solvers. After reading the CVM paper we were surprised by some of the reported results. In order to clarify the matter, we decided to reproduce some of the experiments. It turns out that to some extent, our results contradict those reported. Reasons of these different behaviors are given through the analysis of the stopping criterion.

<p>Author: Ryan M. Rifkin, Ross A. Lippert</p><p>Abstract: Regularization is an approach to function learning that balances ﬁt and smoothness. In practice, we search for a function f with a ﬁnite representation f = ∑i ci φi (·). In most treatments, the ci are the primary objects of study. We consider value regularization, constructing optimization problems in which the predicted values at the training points are the primary variables, and therefore the central objects of study. Although this is a simple change, it has profound consequences. From convex conjugacy and the theory of Fenchel duality, we derive separate optimality conditions for the regularization and loss portions of the learning problem; this technique yields clean and short derivations of standard algorithms. This framework is ideally suited to studying many other phenomena at the intersection of learning theory and optimization. We obtain a value-based variant of the representer theorem, which underscores the transductive nature of regularization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We unify and extend previous results on learning kernel functions, with very simple proofs. We analyze the use of unregularized bias terms in optimization problems, and low-rank approximations to kernel matrices, obtaining new results in these areas. In summary, the combination of value regularization and Fenchel duality are valuable tools for studying the optimization problems in machine learning.

<p>Author: J. Zico Kolter, Marcus A. Maloof</p><p>Abstract: We present an ensemble method for concept drift that dynamically creates and removes weighted experts in response to changes in performance. The method, dynamic weighted majority (DWM), uses four mechanisms to cope with concept drift: It trains online learners of the ensemble, it weights those learners based on their performance, it removes them, also based on their performance, and it adds new experts based on the global performance of the ensemble. After an extensive evaluation— consisting of ﬁve experiments, eight learners, and thirty data sets that varied in type of target concept, size, presence of noise, and the like—we concluded that DWM outperformed other learners that only incrementally learn concept descriptions, that maintain and use previously encountered examples, and that employ an unweighted, ﬁxed-size ensemble of experts.

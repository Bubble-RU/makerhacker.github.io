<p>Author: Ambuj Tewari, Peter L. Bartlett</p><p>Abstract: Binary classiﬁcation is a well studied special case of the classiﬁcation problem. Statistical properties of binary classiﬁers, such as consistency, have been investigated in a variety of settings. Binary classiﬁcation methods can be generalized in many ways to handle multiple classes. It turns out that one can lose consistency in generalizing a binary classiﬁcation method to deal with multiple classes.

<p>Author: Miroslav Dudík, Steven J. Phillips, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: We present a uniﬁed and complete account of maximum entropy density estimation subject to constraints represented by convex potential functions or, alternatively, by convex regularization. We provide fully general performance guarantees and an algorithm with a complete convergence proof. As special cases, we easily derive performance guarantees for many known regularization types, including 1 , 2 , 2 , and 1 + 2 style regularization. We propose an algorithm solving a large and 2 2 general subclass of generalized maximum entropy problems, including all discussed in the paper, and prove its convergence. Our approach generalizes and uniﬁes techniques based on information geometry and Bregman divergences as well as those based more directly on compactness. Our work is motivated by a novel application of maximum entropy to species distribution modeling, an important problem in conservation biology and ecology. In a set of experiments on real-world data, we demonstrate the utility of maximum entropy in this setting. We explore effects of different feature types, sample sizes, and regularization levels on the performance of maxent, and discuss interpretability of the resulting models.

<p>Author: Rie Johnson, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of Laplacian normalization in graph-based semi-supervised learning. To this end, we consider multi-class transductive learning on graphs with Laplacian regularization. Generalization bounds are derived using geometric properties of the graph. Speciﬁcally, by introducing a deﬁnition of graph cut from learning theory, we obtain generalization bounds that depend on the Laplacian regularizer. We then use this analysis to better understand the role of graph Laplacian matrix normalization. Under assumptions that the cut is small, we derive near-optimal normalization factors by approximately minimizing the generalization bounds. The analysis reveals the limitations of the standard degree-based normalization method in that the resulting normalization factors can vary signiﬁcantly within each connected component with the same class label, which may cause inferior generalization performance. Our theory also suggests a remedy that does not suffer from this problem. Experiments conﬁrm the superiority of the normalization scheme motivated by learning theory on artiﬁcial and real-world data sets.

<p>Author: Nikolas List, Hans Ulrich Simon</p><p>Abstract: We present a general decomposition algorithm that is uniformly applicable to every (suitably normalized) instance of Convex Quadratic Optimization and efﬁciently approaches an optimal solution. The number of iterations required to be within ε of optimality grows linearly with 1/ε and quadratically with the number m of variables. The working set selection can be performed in polynomial time. If we restrict our considerations to instances of Convex Quadratic Optimization with at most k0 equality constraints for some ﬁxed constant k0 plus some so-called box-constraints (conditions that hold for most variants of SVM-optimization), the working set is found in linear time. Our analysis builds on a generalization of the concept of rate certifying pairs that was introduced by Hush and Scovel. In order to extend their results to arbitrary instances of Convex Quadratic Optimization, we introduce the general notion of a rate certifying q-set. We improve on the results by Hush and Scovel (2003) in several ways. First our result holds for Convex Quadratic Optimization whereas the results by Hush and Scovel are specialized to SVM-optimization. Second, we achieve a higher rate of convergence even for the special case of SVM-optimization (despite the generality of our approach). Third, our analysis is technically simpler. We prove furthermore that the strategy for working set selection which is based on rate certifying sets coincides with a strategy which is based on a so-called “sparse witness of sub-optimality”. Viewed from this perspective, our main result improves on convergence results by List and Simon (2004) and Simon (2004) by providing convergence rates (and by holding under more general conditions).

<p>Author: Ryan M. Rifkin, Ross A. Lippert</p><p>Abstract: Regularization is an approach to function learning that balances ﬁt and smoothness. In practice, we search for a function f with a ﬁnite representation f = ∑i ci φi (·). In most treatments, the ci are the primary objects of study. We consider value regularization, constructing optimization problems in which the predicted values at the training points are the primary variables, and therefore the central objects of study. Although this is a simple change, it has profound consequences. From convex conjugacy and the theory of Fenchel duality, we derive separate optimality conditions for the regularization and loss portions of the learning problem; this technique yields clean and short derivations of standard algorithms. This framework is ideally suited to studying many other phenomena at the intersection of learning theory and optimization. We obtain a value-based variant of the representer theorem, which underscores the transductive nature of regularization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We unify and extend previous results on learning kernel functions, with very simple proofs. We analyze the use of unregularized bias terms in optimization problems, and low-rank approximations to kernel matrices, obtaining new results in these areas. In summary, the combination of value regularization and Fenchel duality are valuable tools for studying the optimization problems in machine learning.

<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Iftach Nachman, Nir Friedman</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian networks in general, and continuous variable networks in particular, have become increasingly popular in recent years, largely due to advances in methods that facilitate automatic learning from data. Yet, despite these advances, the key task of learning the structure of such models remains a computationally intensive procedure, which limits most applications to parameter learning. This problem is even more acute when learning networks in the presence of missing values or hidden variables, a scenario that is part of many real-life problems. In this work we present a general method for speeding structure search for continuous variable networks with common parametric distributions. We efﬁciently evaluate the approximate merit of candidate structure modiﬁcations and apply time consuming (exact) computations only to the most promising ones, thereby achieving signiﬁcant improvement in the running time of the search algorithm. Our method also naturally and efﬁciently facilitates the addition of useful new hidden variables into the network structure, a task that is typically considered both conceptually difﬁcult and computationally prohibitive. We demonstrate our method on synthetic and real-life data sets, both for learning structure on fully and partially observable data, and for introducing new hidden variables during structure search.

<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: One of the nice properties of kernel classiﬁers such as SVMs is that they often produce sparse solutions. However, the decision functions of these classiﬁers cannot always be used to estimate the conditional probability of the class label. We investigate the relationship between these two properties and show that these are intimately related: sparseness does not occur when the conditional probabilities can be unambiguously estimated. We consider a family of convex loss functions and derive sharp asymptotic results for the fraction of data that becomes support vectors. This enables us to characterize the exact trade-off between sparseness and the ability to estimate conditional probabilities for these loss functions.

<p>Author: Marc Boullé</p><p>Abstract: The naive Bayes classiﬁer has proved to be very effective on many real data applications. Its performance usually beneﬁts from an accurate estimation of univariate conditional probabilities and from variable selection. However, although variable selection is a desirable feature, it is prone to overﬁtting. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian regularization technique to select the most probable subset of variables compliant with the naive Bayes assumption. We also study the limits of Bayesian model averaging in the case of the naive Bayes assumption and introduce a new weighting scheme based on the ability of the models to conditionally compress the class labels. The weighting scheme on the models reduces to a weighting scheme on the variables, and ﬁnally results in a naive Bayes classiﬁer with “soft variable selection”. Extensive experiments show that the compressionbased averaged classiﬁer outperforms the Bayesian model averaging scheme.

<p>Author: Carine Hue, Marc Boullé</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the supervised learning task which consists in predicting the normalized rank of a numerical variable. We introduce a novel probabilistic approach to estimate the posterior distribution of the target rank conditionally to the predictors. We turn this learning task into a model selection problem. For that, we deﬁne a 2D partitioning family obtained by discretizing numerical variables and grouping categorical ones and we derive an analytical criterion to select the partition with the highest posterior probability. We show how these partitions can be used to build univariate predictors and multivariate ones under a naive Bayes assumption. We also propose a new evaluation criterion for probabilistic rank estimators. Based on the logarithmic score, we show that such criterion presents the advantage to be minored, which is not the case of the logarithmic score computed for probabilistic value estimator. A ﬁrst set of experimentations on synthetic data shows the good properties of the proposed criterion and of our partitioning approach. A second set of experimentations on real data shows competitive performance of the univariate and selective naive Bayes rank estimators projected on the value range compared to methods submitted to a recent challenge on probabilistic metric regression tasks. Our approach is applicable for all regression problems with categorical or numerical predictors. It is particularly interesting for those with a high number of predictors as it automatically detects the variables which contain predictive information. It builds pertinent predictors of the normalized rank of the numerical target from one or several predictors. As the criteria selection is regularized by the presence of a prior and a posterior term, it does not suffer from overﬁtting.

<p>Author: Stéphan Clémençon, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: We formulate a local form of the bipartite ranking problem where the goal is to focus on the best instances. We propose a methodology based on the construction of real-valued scoring functions. We study empirical risk minimization of dedicated statistics which involve empirical quantiles of the scores. We ﬁrst state the problem of ﬁnding the best instances which can be cast as a classiﬁcation problem with mass constraint. Next, we develop special performance measures for the local ranking problem which extend the Area Under an ROC Curve (AUC) criterion and describe the optimal elements of these new criteria. We also highlight the fact that the goal of ranking the best instances cannot be achieved in a stage-wise manner where ﬁrst, the best instances would be tentatively identiﬁed and then a standard AUC criterion could be applied. Eventually, we state preliminary statistical results for the local ranking problem.

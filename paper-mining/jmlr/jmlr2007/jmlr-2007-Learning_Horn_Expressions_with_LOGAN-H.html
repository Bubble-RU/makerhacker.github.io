We discuss the relationship of this class of languages to other common classes discussed in grammatical inference. It transpires that it is not necessary to identify constituents in order to learn a context-free language—it is sufﬁcient to identify the syntactic congruence, and the operations of the syntactic monoid can be converted into a context-free grammar. We also discuss modiﬁcations to the algorithm that produces a reduction system rather than a context-free grammar, that will be much more compact. We discuss the relationship to Angluin’s notion of reversibility for regular languages. We also demonstrate that an implementation of this algorithm is capable of learning a classic example of structure dependent syntax in English: this constitutes a refutation of an argument that has been used in support of nativist theories of language.

<p>Author: Art B. Owen</p><p>Abstract: In binary classiﬁcation problems it is common for the two classes to be imbalanced: one case is very rare compared to the other. In this paper we consider the inﬁnitely imbalanced case where one class has a ﬁnite sample size and the other class’s sample size grows without bound. For logistic regression, the inﬁnitely imbalanced case often has a useful solution. Under mild conditions, the intercept diverges as expected, but the rest of the coefﬁcient vector approaches a non trivial and useful limit. That limit can be expressed in terms of exponential tilting and is the minimum of a convex objective function. The limiting form of logistic regression suggests a computational shortcut for fraud detection problems.

<p>Author: Roni Khardon, Gabriel Wachman</p><p>Abstract: A large number of variants of the Perceptron algorithm have been proposed and partially evaluated in recent work. One type of algorithm aims for noise tolerance by replacing the last hypothesis of the perceptron with another hypothesis or a vote among hypotheses. Another type simply adds a margin term to the perceptron in order to increase robustness and accuracy, as done in support vector machines. A third type borrows further from support vector machines and constrains the update function of the perceptron in ways that mimic soft-margin techniques. The performance of these algorithms, and the potential for combining different techniques, has not been studied in depth. This paper provides such an experimental study and reveals some interesting facts about the algorithms. In particular the perceptron with margin is an effective method for tolerating noise and stabilizing the algorithm. This is surprising since the margin in itself is not designed or used for noise tolerance, and there are no known guarantees for such performance. In most cases, similar performance is obtained by the voted-perceptron which has the advantage that it does not require parameter selection. Techniques using soft margin ideas are run-time intensive and do not give additional performance beneﬁts. The results also highlight the difﬁculty with automatic parameter selection which is required with some of these variants.

<p>Author: Saher Esmeir, Shaul Markovitch</p><p>Abstract: The majority of existing algorithms for learning decision trees are greedy—a tree is induced topdown, making locally optimal decisions at each node. In most cases, however, the constructed tree is not globally optimal. Even the few non-greedy learners cannot learn good trees when the concept is difﬁcult. Furthermore, they require a ﬁxed amount of time and are not able to generate a better tree if additional time is available. We introduce a framework for anytime induction of decision trees that overcomes these problems by trading computation speed for better tree quality. Our proposed family of algorithms employs a novel strategy for evaluating candidate splits. A biased sampling of the space of consistent trees rooted at an attribute is used to estimate the size of the minimal tree under that attribute, and an attribute with the smallest expected tree is selected. We present two types of anytime induction algorithms: a contract algorithm that determines the sample size on the basis of a pre-given allocation of time, and an interruptible algorithm that starts with a greedy tree and continuously improves subtrees by additional sampling. Experimental results indicate that, for several hard concepts, our proposed approach exhibits good anytime behavior and yields signiﬁcantly better decision trees when more time is available.

<p>Author: Kwangmoo Koh, Seung-Jean Kim, Stephen Boyd</p><p>Abstract: Logistic regression with 1 regularization has been proposed as a promising method for feature selection in classiﬁcation problems. In this paper we describe an efﬁcient interior-point method for solving large-scale 1 -regularized logistic regression problems. Small problems with up to a thousand or so features and examples can be solved in seconds on a PC; medium sized problems, with tens of thousands of features and examples, can be solved in tens of seconds (assuming some sparsity in the data). A variation on the basic method, that uses a preconditioned conjugate gradient method to compute the search step, can solve very large problems, with a million features and examples (e.g., the 20 Newsgroups data set), in a few minutes, on a PC. Using warm-start techniques, a good approximation of the entire regularization path can be computed much more efﬁciently than by solving a family of problems independently. Keywords: logistic regression, feature selection, 1 regularization, regularization path, interiorpoint methods.</p><p>6 0.16283414 <a title="47-lsi-6" href="./jmlr-2007-Noise_Tolerant_Variants_of_the_Perceptron_Algorithm.html">58 jmlr-2007-Noise Tolerant Variants of the Perceptron Algorithm</a></p>

The current paper shows how the algorithm can be implemented in a practical system, and introduces a new algorithm based on it that avoids interaction and learns from examples only. The L OG A N -H system implements these algorithms and adds several facilities and optimizations that allow efﬁcient applications in a wide range of problems. As one of the important ingredients, the system includes several fast procedures for solving the subsumption problem, an NP-complete problem that needs to be solved many times during the learning process. We describe qualitative and quantitative experiments in several domains. The experiments demonstrate that the system can deal with varied problems, large amounts of data, and that it achieves good classiﬁcation accuracy.

<p>Author: J. Zico Kolter, Marcus A. Maloof</p><p>Abstract: We present an ensemble method for concept drift that dynamically creates and removes weighted experts in response to changes in performance. The method, dynamic weighted majority (DWM), uses four mechanisms to cope with concept drift: It trains online learners of the ensemble, it weights those learners based on their performance, it removes them, also based on their performance, and it adds new experts based on the global performance of the ensemble. After an extensive evaluation— consisting of ﬁve experiments, eight learners, and thirty data sets that varied in type of target concept, size, presence of noise, and the like—we concluded that DWM outperformed other learners that only incrementally learn concept descriptions, that maintain and use previously encountered examples, and that employ an unweighted, ﬁxed-size ensemble of experts.

<p>Author: Yuesheng Xu, Haizhang Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by mathematical learning from training data, we introduce the notion of reﬁnable kernels. Various characterizations of reﬁnable kernels are presented. The concept of reﬁnable kernels leads to the introduction of wavelet-like reproducing kernels. We also investigate a reﬁnable kernel that forms a Riesz basis. In particular, we characterize reﬁnable translation invariant kernels, and reﬁnable kernels deﬁned by reﬁnable functions. This study leads to multiresolution analysis of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

<p>Author: Niels Landwehr, Kristian Kersting, Luc De Raedt</p><p>Abstract: A novel relational learning approach that tightly integrates the na¨ve Bayes learning scheme with ı the inductive logic programming rule-learner FOIL is presented. In contrast to previous combinations that have employed na¨ve Bayes only for post-processing the rule sets, the presented approach ı employs the na¨ve Bayes criterion to guide its search directly. The proposed technique is impleı mented in the N FOIL and T FOIL systems, which employ standard na¨ve Bayes and tree augmented ı na¨ve Bayes models respectively. We show that these integrated approaches to probabilistic model ı and rule learning outperform post-processing approaches. They also yield signiﬁcantly more accurate models than simple rule learning and are competitive with more sophisticated ILP systems.

<p>Author: Saher Esmeir, Shaul Markovitch</p><p>Abstract: The majority of existing algorithms for learning decision trees are greedy—a tree is induced topdown, making locally optimal decisions at each node. In most cases, however, the constructed tree is not globally optimal. Even the few non-greedy learners cannot learn good trees when the concept is difﬁcult. Furthermore, they require a ﬁxed amount of time and are not able to generate a better tree if additional time is available. We introduce a framework for anytime induction of decision trees that overcomes these problems by trading computation speed for better tree quality. Our proposed family of algorithms employs a novel strategy for evaluating candidate splits. A biased sampling of the space of consistent trees rooted at an attribute is used to estimate the size of the minimal tree under that attribute, and an attribute with the smallest expected tree is selected. We present two types of anytime induction algorithms: a contract algorithm that determines the sample size on the basis of a pre-given allocation of time, and an interruptible algorithm that starts with a greedy tree and continuously improves subtrees by additional sampling. Experimental results indicate that, for several hard concepts, our proposed approach exhibits good anytime behavior and yields signiﬁcantly better decision trees when more time is available.

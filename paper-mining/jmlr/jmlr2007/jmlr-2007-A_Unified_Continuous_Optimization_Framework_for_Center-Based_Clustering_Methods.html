<p>Author: Jia Li, Surajit Ray, Bruce G. Lindsay</p><p>Abstract: A new clustering approach based on mode identiﬁcation is developed by applying new optimization techniques to a nonparametric density estimator. A cluster is formed by those sample points that ascend to the same local maximum (mode) of the density function. The path from a point to its associated mode is efﬁciently solved by an EM-style algorithm, namely, the Modal EM (MEM). This method is then extended for hierarchical clustering by recursively locating modes of kernel density estimators with increasing bandwidths. Without model ﬁtting, the mode-based clustering yields a density description for every cluster, a major advantage of mixture-model-based clustering. Moreover, it ensures that every cluster corresponds to a bump of the density. The issue of diagnosing clustering results is also investigated. Speciﬁcally, a pairwise separability measure for clusters is deﬁned using the ridgeline between the density bumps of two clusters. The ridgeline is solved for by the Ridgeline EM (REM) algorithm, an extension of MEM. Based upon this new measure, a cluster merging procedure is created to enforce strong separation. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate that the mode-based clustering approach tends to combine the strengths of linkage and mixture-model-based clustering. In addition, the approach is robust in high dimensions and when clusters deviate substantially from Gaussian distributions. Both of these cases pose difﬁculty for parametric mixture modeling.

<p>Author: Arindam Banerjee, Inderjit Dhillon, Joydeep Ghosh, Srujana Merugu, Dharmendra S. Modha</p><p>Abstract: Co-clustering, or simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a two-dimensional data matrix, is rapidly becoming a powerful data analysis technique. Co-clustering has enjoyed wide success in varied application domains such as text clustering, gene-microarray analysis, natural language processing and image, speech and video analysis. In this paper, we introduce a partitional co-clustering formulation that is driven by the search for a good matrix approximation—every co-clustering is associated with an approximation of the original data matrix and the quality of co-clustering is determined by the approximation error. We allow the approximation error to be measured using a large class of loss functions called Bregman divergences that include squared Euclidean distance and KL-divergence as special cases. In addition, we permit multiple structurally different co-clustering schemes that preserve various linear statistics of the original data matrix. To accomplish the above tasks, we introduce a new minimum Bregman information (MBI) principle that simultaneously generalizes the maximum entropy and standard least squares principles, and leads to a matrix approximation that is optimal among all generalized additive models in a certain natural parameter space. Analysis based on this principle yields an elegant meta algorithm, special cases of which include most previously known alternate minimization based clustering algorithms such as kmeans and co-clustering algorithms such as information theoretic (Dhillon et al., 2003b) and minimum sum-squared residue co-clustering (Cho et al., 2004). To demonstrate the generality and ﬂexibility of our co-clustering framework, we provide examples and empirical evidence on a varic 2007 Arindam Banerjee, Inderjit S.

<p>Author: Wei Pan, Xiaotong Shen</p><p>Abstract: Variable selection in clustering analysis is both challenging and important. In the context of modelbased clustering analysis with a common diagonal covariance matrix, which is especially suitable for “high dimension, low sample size” settings, we propose a penalized likelihood approach with an L1 penalty function, automatically realizing variable selection via thresholding and delivering a sparse solution. We derive an EM algorithm to ﬁt our proposed model, and propose a modiﬁed BIC as a model selection criterion to choose the number of components and the penalization parameter.

<p>Author: Stéphan Clémençon, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: We formulate a local form of the bipartite ranking problem where the goal is to focus on the best instances. We propose a methodology based on the construction of real-valued scoring functions. We study empirical risk minimization of dedicated statistics which involve empirical quantiles of the scores. We ﬁrst state the problem of ﬁnding the best instances which can be cast as a classiﬁcation problem with mass constraint. Next, we develop special performance measures for the local ranking problem which extend the Area Under an ROC Curve (AUC) criterion and describe the optimal elements of these new criteria. We also highlight the fact that the goal of ranking the best instances cannot be achieved in a stage-wise manner where ﬁrst, the best instances would be tentatively identiﬁed and then a standard AUC criterion could be applied. Eventually, we state preliminary statistical results for the local ranking problem.

<p>Author: Philippe Rigollet</p><p>Abstract: We consider semi-supervised classiﬁcation when part of the available data is unlabeled. These unlabeled data can be useful for the classiﬁcation problem when we make an assumption relating the behavior of the regression function to that of the marginal distribution. Seeger (2000) proposed the well-known cluster assumption as a reasonable one. We propose a mathematical formulation of this assumption and a method based on density level sets estimation that takes advantage of it to achieve fast rates of convergence both in the number of unlabeled examples and the number of labeled examples.

At the same time, the ﬁeld of machine learning has developed a large body of powerful learning algorithms for diverse applications. However, the true potential of these methods is not used, since existing implementations are not openly shared, resulting in software with low usability, and weak interoperability. We argue that this situation can be signiﬁcantly improved by increasing incentives for researchers to publish their software under an open source model. Additionally, we outline the problems authors are faced with when trying to publish algorithmic implementations of machine learning methods. We believe that a resource of peer reviewed software accompanied by short articles would be highly valuable to both the machine learning and the general scientiﬁc community.

<p>Author: Marc Teboulle</p><p>Abstract: Center-based partitioning clustering algorithms rely on minimizing an appropriately formulated objective function, and different formulations suggest different possible algorithms. In this paper, we start with the standard nonconvex and nonsmooth formulation of the partitioning clustering problem. We demonstrate that within this elementary formulation, convex analysis tools and optimization theory provide a unifying language and framework to design, analyze and extend hard and soft center-based clustering algorithms, through a generic algorithm which retains the computational simplicity of the popular k-means scheme. We show that several well known and more recent center-based clustering algorithms, which have been derived either heuristically, or/and have emerged from intuitive analogies in physics, statistical techniques and information theoretic perspectives can be recovered as special cases of the proposed analysis and we streamline their relationships.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Philip M. Long, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning multiple tasks in parallel within the online learning framework. On each online round, the algorithm receives an instance for each of the parallel tasks and responds by predicting the label of each instance. We consider the case where the predictions made on each round all contribute toward a common goal. The relationship between the various tasks is deﬁned by a global loss function, which evaluates the overall quality of the multiple predictions made on each round. Speciﬁcally, each individual prediction is associated with its own loss value, and then these multiple loss values are combined into a single number using the global loss function. We focus on the case where the global loss function belongs to the family of absolute norms, and present several online learning algorithms for the induced problem. We prove worst-case relative loss bounds for all of our algorithms, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a largescale multiclass-multilabel text categorization problem.

<p>Author: Arindam Banerjee, Inderjit Dhillon, Joydeep Ghosh, Srujana Merugu, Dharmendra S. Modha</p><p>Abstract: Co-clustering, or simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a two-dimensional data matrix, is rapidly becoming a powerful data analysis technique. Co-clustering has enjoyed wide success in varied application domains such as text clustering, gene-microarray analysis, natural language processing and image, speech and video analysis. In this paper, we introduce a partitional co-clustering formulation that is driven by the search for a good matrix approximation—every co-clustering is associated with an approximation of the original data matrix and the quality of co-clustering is determined by the approximation error. We allow the approximation error to be measured using a large class of loss functions called Bregman divergences that include squared Euclidean distance and KL-divergence as special cases. In addition, we permit multiple structurally different co-clustering schemes that preserve various linear statistics of the original data matrix. To accomplish the above tasks, we introduce a new minimum Bregman information (MBI) principle that simultaneously generalizes the maximum entropy and standard least squares principles, and leads to a matrix approximation that is optimal among all generalized additive models in a certain natural parameter space. Analysis based on this principle yields an elegant meta algorithm, special cases of which include most previously known alternate minimization based clustering algorithms such as kmeans and co-clustering algorithms such as information theoretic (Dhillon et al., 2003b) and minimum sum-squared residue co-clustering (Cho et al., 2004). To demonstrate the generality and ﬂexibility of our co-clustering framework, we provide examples and empirical evidence on a varic 2007 Arindam Banerjee, Inderjit S.

<p>Author: Jean-Yves Audibert, Olivier Bousquet</p><p>Abstract: There exist many different generalization error bounds in statistical learning theory. Each of these bounds contains an improvement over the others for certain situations or algorithms. Our goal is, ﬁrst, to underline the links between these bounds, and second, to combine the different improvements into a single bound. In particular we combine the PAC-Bayes approach introduced by McAllester (1998), which is interesting for randomized predictions, with the optimal union bound provided by the generic chaining technique developed by Fernique and Talagrand (see Talagrand, 1996), in a way that also takes into account the variance of the combined functions. We also show how this connects to Rademacher based bounds.

<p>Author: Vitaly Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problems of attribute-efﬁcient PAC learning of two well-studied concept classes: parity functions and DNF expressions over {0, 1}n . We show that attribute-efﬁcient learning of parities with respect to the uniform distribution is equivalent to decoding high-rate random linear codes from low number of errors, a long-standing open problem in coding theory. This is the ﬁrst evidence that attribute-efﬁcient learning of a natural PAC learnable concept class can be computationally hard.

Using a simple non-adaptive parity learning algorithm and a modiﬁcation of Levin’s algorithm for locating a weakly-correlated parity due to Bshouty et al.

Our algorithm runs in time O(ns4 /ε) and ˜ uses O(s4 · log2 n/ε) non-adaptive MQs, where s is the number of terms in the shortest DNF representation of the target concept. The algorithm improves on the best previous algorithm for learning DNF (of Bshouty et al., 1999) and can also be easily modiﬁed to tolerate random persistent classiﬁcation noise in MQs.

<p>Author: Manu Chhabra, Robert A. Jacobs, Daniel Štefankovič</p><p>Abstract: In a search problem, an agent uses the membership oracle of a target concept to ﬁnd a positive example of the concept. In a shaped search problem the agent is aided by a sequence of increasingly restrictive concepts leading to the target concept (analogous to behavioral shaping). The concepts are given by membership oracles, and the agent has to ﬁnd a positive example of the target concept while minimizing the total number of oracle queries. We show that for the concept class of intervals on the real line an agent using a bounded number of queries per oracle exists. In contrast, for the concept class of unions of two intervals on the real line no agent with a bounded number of queries per oracle exists. We then investigate the (amortized) number of queries per oracle needed for the shaped search problem over other concept classes. We explore the following methods to obtain efﬁcient agents. For axis-parallel rectangles we use a bootstrapping technique to obtain gradually better approximations of the target concept. We show that given rectangles R ⊆ A ⊆ R d one can obtain a rectangle A ⊇ R with vol(A )/vol(R) ≤ 2, using only O(d · vol(A)/vol(R)) random samples from A. For ellipsoids of bounded eccentricity in Rd we analyze a deterministic ray-shooting process which uses a sequence of rays to get close to the centroid. Finally, we use algorithms for generating random points in convex bodies (Dyer et al., 1991; Kannan et al., 1997) to give a randomized agent for the concept class of convex bodies. In the ﬁnal section, we explore connections between our bootstrapping method and active learning.

<p>Author: Stéphan Clémençon, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: We formulate a local form of the bipartite ranking problem where the goal is to focus on the best instances. We propose a methodology based on the construction of real-valued scoring functions. We study empirical risk minimization of dedicated statistics which involve empirical quantiles of the scores. We ﬁrst state the problem of ﬁnding the best instances which can be cast as a classiﬁcation problem with mass constraint. Next, we develop special performance measures for the local ranking problem which extend the Area Under an ROC Curve (AUC) criterion and describe the optimal elements of these new criteria. We also highlight the fact that the goal of ranking the best instances cannot be achieved in a stage-wise manner where ﬁrst, the best instances would be tentatively identiﬁed and then a standard AUC criterion could be applied. Eventually, we state preliminary statistical results for the local ranking problem.

<p>Author: Sridhar Mahadevan, Mauro Maggioni</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel spectral framework for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) by jointly learning representations and optimal policies. The major components of the framework described in this paper include: (i) A general scheme for constructing representations or basis functions by diagonalizing symmetric diffusion operators (ii) A speciﬁc instantiation of this approach where global basis functions called proto-value functions (PVFs) are formed using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian on an undirected graph formed from state transitions induced by the MDP (iii) A three-phased procedure called representation policy iteration comprising of a sample collection phase, a representation learning phase that constructs basis functions from samples, and a ﬁnal parameter estimation phase that determines an (approximately) optimal policy within the (linear) subspace spanned by the (current) basis functions. (iv) A speciﬁc instantiation of the RPI framework using least-squares policy iteration (LSPI) as the parameter estimation method (v) Several strategies for scaling the proposed approach to large discrete and continuous state spaces, including the Nystr¨ m extension for out-of-sample interpolation of eigenfunctions, and the use of Kronecker o sum factorization to construct compact eigenfunctions in product spaces such as factored MDPs (vi) Finally, a series of illustrative discrete and continuous control tasks, which both illustrate the concepts and provide a benchmark for evaluating the proposed approach. Many challenges remain to be addressed in scaling the proposed framework to large MDPs, and several elaboration of the proposed framework are brieﬂy summarized at the end.

<p>Author: Matthias Hein, Jean-Yves Audibert, Ulrike von Luxburg</p><p>Abstract: Given a sample from a probability measure with support on a submanifold in Euclidean space one can construct a neighborhood graph which can be seen as an approximation of the submanifold. The graph Laplacian of such a graph is used in several machine learning methods like semi-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction and clustering. In this paper we determine the pointwise limit of three different graph Laplacians used in the literature as the sample size increases and the neighborhood size approaches zero. We show that for a uniform measure on the submanifold all graph Laplacians have the same limit up to constants. However in the case of a non-uniform measure on the submanifold only the so called random walk graph Laplacian converges to the weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator.

<p>Author: Ambuj Tewari, Peter L. Bartlett</p><p>Abstract: Binary classiﬁcation is a well studied special case of the classiﬁcation problem. Statistical properties of binary classiﬁers, such as consistency, have been investigated in a variety of settings. Binary classiﬁcation methods can be generalized in many ways to handle multiple classes. It turns out that one can lose consistency in generalizing a binary classiﬁcation method to deal with multiple classes. We study a rich family of multiclass methods and provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for their consistency. We illustrate our approach by applying it to some multiclass methods proposed in the literature.

<p>Author: Ariel Elbaz, Homin K. Lee, Rocco A. Servedio, Andrew Wan</p><p>Abstract: We consider a natural framework of learning from correlated data, in which successive examples used for learning are generated according to a random walk over the space of possible examples. A recent paper by Bshouty et al. (2003) shows that the class of polynomial-size DNF formulas is efﬁciently learnable in this random walk model; this result suggests that the Random Walk model is more powerful than comparable standard models of learning from independent examples, in which similarly efﬁcient DNF learning algorithms are not known. We give strong evidence that the Random Walk model is indeed more powerful than the standard model, by showing that if any cryptographic one-way function exists (a universally held belief in cryptography), then there is a class of functions that can be learned efﬁciently in the Random Walk setting but not in the standard setting where all examples are independent.

<p>Author: Sridhar Mahadevan, Mauro Maggioni</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel spectral framework for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) by jointly learning representations and optimal policies. The major components of the framework described in this paper include: (i) A general scheme for constructing representations or basis functions by diagonalizing symmetric diffusion operators (ii) A speciﬁc instantiation of this approach where global basis functions called proto-value functions (PVFs) are formed using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian on an undirected graph formed from state transitions induced by the MDP (iii) A three-phased procedure called representation policy iteration comprising of a sample collection phase, a representation learning phase that constructs basis functions from samples, and a ﬁnal parameter estimation phase that determines an (approximately) optimal policy within the (linear) subspace spanned by the (current) basis functions. (iv) A speciﬁc instantiation of the RPI framework using least-squares policy iteration (LSPI) as the parameter estimation method (v) Several strategies for scaling the proposed approach to large discrete and continuous state spaces, including the Nystr¨ m extension for out-of-sample interpolation of eigenfunctions, and the use of Kronecker o sum factorization to construct compact eigenfunctions in product spaces such as factored MDPs (vi) Finally, a series of illustrative discrete and continuous control tasks, which both illustrate the concepts and provide a benchmark for evaluating the proposed approach. Many challenges remain to be addressed in scaling the proposed framework to large MDPs, and several elaboration of the proposed framework are brieﬂy summarized at the end.

<p>Author: Vitaly Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problems of attribute-efﬁcient PAC learning of two well-studied concept classes: parity functions and DNF expressions over {0, 1}n . We show that attribute-efﬁcient learning of parities with respect to the uniform distribution is equivalent to decoding high-rate random linear codes from low number of errors, a long-standing open problem in coding theory. This is the ﬁrst evidence that attribute-efﬁcient learning of a natural PAC learnable concept class can be computationally hard. An algorithm is said to use membership queries (MQs) non-adaptively if the points at which the algorithm asks MQs do not depend on the target concept. Using a simple non-adaptive parity learning algorithm and a modiﬁcation of Levin’s algorithm for locating a weakly-correlated parity due to Bshouty et al. (1999), we give the ﬁrst non-adaptive and attribute-efﬁcient algorithm for ˜ learning DNF with respect to the uniform distribution. Our algorithm runs in time O(ns4 /ε) and ˜ uses O(s4 · log2 n/ε) non-adaptive MQs, where s is the number of terms in the shortest DNF representation of the target concept. The algorithm improves on the best previous algorithm for learning DNF (of Bshouty et al., 1999) and can also be easily modiﬁed to tolerate random persistent classiﬁcation noise in MQs.

<p>Author: Onur C. Hamsici, Aleix M. Martinez</p><p>Abstract: Many feature representations, as in genomics, describe directional data where all feature vectors share a common norm. In other cases, as in computer vision, a norm or variance normalization step, where all feature vectors are normalized to a common length, is generally used. These representations and pre-processing step map the original data from R p to the surface of a hypersphere S p−1 . Such representations should then be modeled using spherical distributions. However, the difﬁculty associated with such spherical representations has prompted researchers to model their spherical data using Gaussian distributions instead—as if the data were represented in R p rather than S p−1 . This opens the question to whether the classiﬁcation results calculated with the Gaussian approximation are the same as those obtained when using the original spherical distributions. In this paper, we show that in some particular cases (which we named spherical-homoscedastic) the answer to this question is positive. In the more general case however, the answer is negative. For this reason, we further investigate the additional error added by the Gaussian modeling. We conclude that the more the data deviates from spherical-homoscedastic, the less advisable it is to employ the Gaussian approximation. We then show how our derivations can be used to deﬁne optimal classiﬁers for spherical-homoscedastic distributions. By using a kernel which maps the original space into one where the data adapts to the spherical-homoscedastic model, we can derive non-linear classiﬁers with potential applications in a large number of problems. We conclude this paper by demonstrating the uses of spherical-homoscedasticity in the classiﬁcation of images of objects, gene expression sequences, and text data.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Philip M. Long, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning multiple tasks in parallel within the online learning framework. On each online round, the algorithm receives an instance for each of the parallel tasks and responds by predicting the label of each instance. We consider the case where the predictions made on each round all contribute toward a common goal. The relationship between the various tasks is deﬁned by a global loss function, which evaluates the overall quality of the multiple predictions made on each round. Speciﬁcally, each individual prediction is associated with its own loss value, and then these multiple loss values are combined into a single number using the global loss function. We focus on the case where the global loss function belongs to the family of absolute norms, and present several online learning algorithms for the induced problem. We prove worst-case relative loss bounds for all of our algorithms, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a largescale multiclass-multilabel text categorization problem.

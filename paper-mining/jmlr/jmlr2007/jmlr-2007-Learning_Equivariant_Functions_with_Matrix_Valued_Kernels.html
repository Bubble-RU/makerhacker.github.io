<p>Author: Natesh S. Pillai, Qiang Wu, Feng Liang, Sayan Mukherjee, Robert L. Wolpert</p><p>Abstract: Kernel methods have been very popular in the machine learning literature in the last ten years, mainly in the context of Tikhonov regularization algorithms. In this paper we study a coherent Bayesian kernel model based on an integral operator deﬁned as the convolution of a kernel with a signed measure. Priors on the random signed measures correspond to prior distributions on the functions mapped by the integral operator. We study several classes of signed measures and their image mapped by the integral operator. In particular, we identify a general class of measures whose image is dense in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) induced by the kernel. A consequence of this result is a function theoretic foundation for using non-parametric prior speciﬁcations in Bayesian modeling, such as Gaussian process and Dirichlet process prior distributions. We discuss the construction of priors on spaces of signed measures using Gaussian and L´ vy processes, e with the Dirichlet processes being a special case the latter. Computational issues involved with sampling from the posterior distribution are outlined for a univariate regression and a high dimensional classiﬁcation problem.

<p>Author: Gavin C. Cawley, Nicola L. C. Talbot</p><p>Abstract: While the model parameters of a kernel machine are typically given by the solution of a convex optimisation problem, with a single global optimum, the selection of good values for the regularisation and kernel parameters is much less straightforward. Fortunately the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure can be performed or a least approximated very efﬁciently in closed form for a wide variety of kernel learning methods, providing a convenient means for model selection. Leave-one-out cross-validation based estimates of performance, however, generally exhibit a relatively high variance and are therefore prone to over-ﬁtting. In this paper, we investigate the novel use of Bayesian regularisation at the second level of inference, adding a regularisation term to the model selection criterion corresponding to a prior over the hyper-parameter values, where the additional regularisation parameters are integrated out analytically. Results obtained on a suite of thirteen real-world and synthetic benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the beneﬁt of this approach.

<p>Author: Marco Loog</p><p>Abstract: Recently, Ye (2005) suggested yet another optimization criterion for discriminant analysis and proposed a characterization of the family of solutions to this objective. The characterization, however, merely describes a part of the full solution set, that is, it is not complete and therefore not at all a characterization. This correspondence ﬁrst gives the correct characterization and afterwards compares it to Ye’s. Keywords: linear discriminant analysis, Fisher criterion, small sample, characterization 1. Classical and New Criteria Given N feature vectors of dimensionality n, a linear reduction of dimensionality, based on classical Fisher LDA, determines an n × d transformation matrix L that, for a given d < K, K the number of classes, maximizes the so-called Fisher criterion: F(A) = tr((A t SW A)−1 (At SB A)) or, equivalently, F0 (A) = tr((At ST A)−1 (At SB A)). Here, SB := ∑K pi (mi − m)(mi − m)t , SW := ∑K pi Si , and i=1 i=1 ST = SB + SW . The matrices SB , SW , and ST are the so-called between-class, pooled within-class, and total covariance matrices. In addition, mi is the mean vector of class i, pi is the prior of class i, and the overall mean m equals ∑k pi mi . Finally, Si is the covariance matrix of class i. i=1 A solution to these optimization problems can be obtained by means of a generalized eigenvalue decomposition, which Fukunaga (1990) relates to a simultaneous diagonalization of the two matrices involved (see also Campbell and Atchley, 1981). More common is it to apply a standard −1 eigenvalue decomposition to S−1 SB (or SW SB ), resulting in an equivalent set of eigenvectors. The d T columns of the optimal solution L are simply taken to equal the d eigenvectors corresponding to the d largest eigenvalues. It is known that this solution is not unique and the full class can be obtained by multiplying L to the right with nonsingular d × d matrices (see Fukunaga, 1990). Clearly, if the total covariance ST is singular, neither the generalized nor the standard eigenvalue decomposition can be readily employed. Directly or indirectly, the problem is that the matrix inverse S−1 does not exist, which is the typical situation when dealing with small samples. In an attempt to T overcome this problem, Ye (2005) introduced a different criterion that is deﬁned as F1 (A) = tr((At ST A)+ (At SB A)) , ∗. Also at Nordic Bioscience Imaging, Hovegade 207, DK-2730 Herlev, Denmark. c 2007 Marco Loog. (1) L OOG where + denotes taking the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of a matrix. Like for F0 , an optimal transform L is one that maximizes the objective F1 . Again, this solution is not unique. 2. Correct Characterization For the full characterization of the set of solutions to Equation (1), initially the problem is looked at from a geometrical point of view (cf., Campbell and Atchley, 1981). It is assumed that the number of samples N is smaller than or equal to the feature dimensionality n. In the undersampled case, it is clear that all data variation occurs in an N − 1-dimensional subspace of the original space. To start with, a PCA of the data is carried out and the ﬁrst N − 1 principal components are rotated to the ﬁrst N − 1 axes of the n-dimensional space by means of a rotation matrix R. This matrix consists of all (normalized) eigenvectors of ST taken as its columns. After this rotation, new total and between-class covariance matrices, ST = Rt ST R and SB = Rt SB R, are obtained. These 0 0 matrices can be partitioned as follows: ST = Σ0T 0 and SB = ΣB 0 , where ΣT and ΣB are N − 1 × 0 N − 1 covariance matrices and ΣT is nonsingular and diagonal by construction. The between-class variation is obviously restricted to the N − 1-dimensional subspace in which the total data variation takes place, therefore a same partitioning of SB is possible. However, the covariance submatrix ΣB is not necessarily diagonal, neither does it have to be nonsingular. Basically, the PCA-based rotation R converts the initial problem into a more convenient one, splitting up the original space in an N − 1-dimensional one in which “everything interesting” takes place and a remaining n − N + 1dimensional subspace in which “nothing happens at all”. Now consider F1 in this transformed space and take a general n × d transformation matrix A, which is partitioned in a way similar to the covariance matrices, that is, X . Y A= (2) Here, X is an N − 1 × d-matrix and Y is of size n − N + 1 × d. Taking this deﬁnition, the following holds (cf., Ye, 2005): t + t F1 (A) = tr((A ST A) (A SB A)) = tr =tr X t ΣT X 0 0 0 + X Y X t ΣB X 0 0 0 t ΣT 0 = tr 0 0 X Y + (Xt ΣT X)−1 0 0 0 X Y t ΣB 0 0 0 X Y X t ΣB X 0 0 0 = tr((Xt ΣT X)−1 (Xt ΣB X)) = F0 (X) . From this it is immediate that a matrix A maximizes F1 if and only if the submatrix X maximizes the original Fisher criterion in the lower-dimensional subspace. Moreover, if L is such a matrix maximizing F1 in the PCA-transformed space, it is easy to check that R−1 L = Rt L provides a solution to the original, general problem that has not been preprocessed by means of a PCA (see also Fukunaga, 1990). A characterization of the complete family of solutions can now be given. Let Λ ∈ RN−1×d be an optimal solution of F0 (X) = tr((Xt ΣT X)−1 (Xt ΣB X)). As already noted in Section 1, the full set of solutions is given by F = {ΛZ ∈ RN−1×d | Z ∈ GLd (R)}, where GLd (R) denotes the general linear group of d × d invertible matrices. The previous paragraph essentially demonstrates that if X ∈ F , A in Equation (2) maximizes F1 . The matrix Y can be chosen ad 2122 C OMPLETE C HARACTERIZATION OF A FAMILY OF S OLUTIONS libitum. Now, the latter provides the solution in the PCA-transformed space and to solve the general problem we need to take the rotation back to the original space into account. All in all, this leads to the following complete family of solutions L , maximizing F1 in the original space: L = Rt ΛZ ∈ Rn×d Z ∈ GLd (R), Y ∈ Rn−N+1×d Y , (3) where Λ = argmaxX tr((Xt ΣT X)−1 (Xt ΣB X)) and Rt takes care of the rotation back. 3. Original Characterization Though not noted by Ye (2005), his attempt to characterize the full set of solutions of Equation (1) is based on a simultaneous diagonalization of the three covariance matrices S B , SW , and ST that is similar to the ideas described by Campbell and Atchley (1981) and Fukunaga (1990). Moreover, Golub and Van Loan (Theorem 8.7.1. 1996) can be readily applied to demonstrate that such simultaneous diagonalization is possible in the small sample setting. After the diagonalization step, partitioned between-class, pooled within-class, and total covariance matrices are considered. This partitioning is similar to the one employed in the previous section, which does not enforce matrices to be diagonal however. In the subsequent optimization step, the classical Fisher criterion is maximized basically in the appropriate subspace, comparable to the approach described above, but in a mildly more involved and concealed way. For this, matrices of the form Rt X are considered, consider Equations (2) and Y (3). However, Y is simply the null matrix and the family of solutions L provided is limited to L = Rt ΛZ ∈ Rn×d Z ∈ GLd (R) . 0 Obviously, this is far from a complete characterization, especially when N − 1 n which is, for instance, typically the case for the data sets considered by Ye (2005). Generally, the utility of a dimensionality reduction criterion, without additional constrains, depends on the efﬁciency over the full set of solutions. As Ye (2005) only considers two very speciﬁc instances from the large class of possibilities, it is unclear to what extent the new criterion really provides an efﬁcient way of performing a reduction of dimensionality.

<p>Author: Kristen Grauman, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: In numerous domains it is useful to represent a single example by the set of the local features or parts that comprise it. However, this representation poses a challenge to many conventional machine learning techniques, since sets may vary in cardinality and elements lack a meaningful ordering. Kernel methods can learn complex functions, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences—generally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function called the pyramid match that measures partial match similarity in time linear in the number of features. The pyramid match maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in order to ﬁnd implicit correspondences based on the ﬁnest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair ﬁrst appears. We show the pyramid match yields a Mercer kernel, and we prove bounds on its error relative to the optimal partial matching cost. We demonstrate our algorithm on both classiﬁcation and regression tasks, including object recognition, 3-D human pose inference, and time of publication estimation for documents, and we show that the proposed method is accurate and signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than current approaches.

<p>Author: Gavin C. Cawley, Nicola L. C. Talbot</p><p>Abstract: While the model parameters of a kernel machine are typically given by the solution of a convex optimisation problem, with a single global optimum, the selection of good values for the regularisation and kernel parameters is much less straightforward. Fortunately the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure can be performed or a least approximated very efﬁciently in closed form for a wide variety of kernel learning methods, providing a convenient means for model selection. Leave-one-out cross-validation based estimates of performance, however, generally exhibit a relatively high variance and are therefore prone to over-ﬁtting. In this paper, we investigate the novel use of Bayesian regularisation at the second level of inference, adding a regularisation term to the model selection criterion corresponding to a prior over the hyper-parameter values, where the additional regularisation parameters are integrated out analytically. Results obtained on a suite of thirteen real-world and synthetic benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the beneﬁt of this approach.

<p>Author: Marco Reisert, Hans Burkhardt</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new class of matrix valued kernels that are ideally suited to learn vector valued equivariant functions. Matrix valued kernels are a natural generalization of the common notion of a kernel. We set the theoretical foundations of so called equivariant matrix valued kernels. We work out several properties of equivariant kernels, we give an interpretation of their behavior and show relations to scalar kernels. The notion of (ir)reducibility of group representations is transferred into the framework of matrix valued kernels. At the end to two exemplary applications are demonstrated. We design a non-linear rotation and translation equivariant ﬁlter for 2D-images and propose an invariant object detector based on the generalized Hough transform.

<p>Author: Ambuj Tewari, Peter L. Bartlett</p><p>Abstract: Binary classiﬁcation is a well studied special case of the classiﬁcation problem. Statistical properties of binary classiﬁers, such as consistency, have been investigated in a variety of settings. Binary classiﬁcation methods can be generalized in many ways to handle multiple classes. It turns out that one can lose consistency in generalizing a binary classiﬁcation method to deal with multiple classes. We study a rich family of multiclass methods and provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for their consistency. We illustrate our approach by applying it to some multiclass methods proposed in the literature.

<p>Author: Amir Globerson, Gal Chechik, Fernando Pereira, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Embedding algorithms search for a low dimensional continuous representation of data, but most algorithms only handle objects of a single type for which pairwise distances are speciﬁed. This paper describes a method for embedding objects of different types, such as images and text, into a single common Euclidean space, based on their co-occurrence statistics. The joint distributions are modeled as exponentials of Euclidean distances in the low-dimensional embedding space, which links the problem to convex optimization over positive semideﬁnite matrices. The local structure of the embedding corresponds to the statistical correlations via random walks in the Euclidean space. We quantify the performance of our method on two text data sets, and show that it consistently and signiﬁcantly outperforms standard methods of statistical correspondence modeling, such as multidimensional scaling, IsoMap and correspondence analysis.

<p>Author: Nikolaj Tatti</p><p>Abstract: The concepts of similarity and distance are crucial in data mining. We consider the problem of deﬁning the distance between two data sets by comparing summary statistics computed from the data sets. The initial deﬁnition of our distance is based on geometrical notions of certain sets of distributions. We show that this distance can be computed in cubic time and that it has several intuitive properties. We also show that this distance is the unique Mahalanobis distance satisfying certain assumptions. We also demonstrate that if we are dealing with binary data sets, then the distance can be represented naturally by certain parity functions, and that it can be evaluated in linear time. Our empirical tests with real world data show that the distance works well.

<p>Author: Yuesheng Xu, Haizhang Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by mathematical learning from training data, we introduce the notion of reﬁnable kernels. Various characterizations of reﬁnable kernels are presented. The concept of reﬁnable kernels leads to the introduction of wavelet-like reproducing kernels. We also investigate a reﬁnable kernel that forms a Riesz basis. In particular, we characterize reﬁnable translation invariant kernels, and reﬁnable kernels deﬁned by reﬁnable functions. This study leads to multiresolution analysis of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

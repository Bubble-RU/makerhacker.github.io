<p>Author: András György, Tamás Linder, Gábor Lugosi, György Ottucsák</p><p>Abstract: The on-line shortest path problem is considered under various models of partial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the loss of the chosen path (deﬁned as the sum of the weights of its composing edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by a quantity that is √ proportional to 1/ n and depends only polynomially on the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with complexity that is linear in the number of rounds n (i.e., the average complexity per round is constant) and in the number of edges. An extension to the so-called label efﬁcient setting is also given, in which the decision maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen path at a total of m n time instances. Another extension is shown where the decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along with simulation results are also presented.

<p>Author: David Mease, Abraham J. Wyner, Andreas Buja</p><p>Abstract: The standard by which binary classiﬁers are usually judged, misclassiﬁcation error, assumes equal costs of misclassifying the two classes or, equivalently, classifying at the 1/2 quantile of the conditional class probability function P[y = 1|x]. Boosted classiﬁcation trees are known to perform quite well for such problems. In this article we consider the use of standard, off-the-shelf boosting for two more general problems: 1) classiﬁcation with unequal costs or, equivalently, classiﬁcation at quantiles other than 1/2, and 2) estimation of the conditional class probability function P[y = 1|x]. We ﬁrst examine whether the latter problem, estimation of P[y = 1|x], can be solved with LogitBoost, and with AdaBoost when combined with a natural link function. The answer is negative: both approaches are often ineffective because they overﬁt P[y = 1|x] even though they perform well as classiﬁers. A major negative point of the present article is the disconnect between class probability estimation and classiﬁcation. Next we consider the practice of over/under-sampling of the two classes. We present an algorithm that uses AdaBoost in conjunction with Over/Under-Sampling and Jittering of the data (“JOUS-Boost”). This algorithm is simple, yet successful, and it preserves the advantage of relative protection against overﬁtting, but for arbitrary misclassiﬁcation costs and, equivalently, arbitrary quantile boundaries. We then use collections of classiﬁers obtained from a grid of quantiles to form estimators of class probabilities. The estimates of the class probabilities compare favorably to those obtained by a variety of methods across both simulated and real data sets.

<p>Author: Yiming Ying, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances provide a rich family of Mercer kernels for learning algorithms. We show that the union of the unit balls of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces generated by Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli (uGC) class. This result conﬁrms a conjecture concerning learnability of Gaussian kernels and veriﬁes the uniform convergence of many learning algorithms involving Gaussians with changing variances. Rademacher averages and empirical covering numbers are used to estimate sample errors of multi-kernel regularization schemes associated with general loss functions. It is then shown that the regularization error associated with the least square loss and the Gaussian kernels can be greatly improved when ﬂexible variances are allowed. Finally, for regularization schemes generated by Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances we present explicit learning rates for regression with least square loss and classiﬁcation with hinge loss.

<p>Author: Nicolás García-Pedrajas, César García-Osorio, Colin Fyfe</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel approach for ensemble construction based on the use of nonlinear projections to achieve both accuracy and diversity of individual classiﬁers. The proposed approach combines the philosophy of boosting, putting more effort on difﬁcult instances, with the basis of the random subspace method. Our main contribution is that instead of using a random subspace, we construct a projection taking into account the instances which have posed most difﬁculties to previous classiﬁers. In this way, consecutive nonlinear projections are created by a neural network trained using only incorrectly classiﬁed instances. The feature subspace induced by the hidden layer of this network is used as the input space to a new classiﬁer. The method is compared with bagging and boosting techniques, showing an improved performance on a large set of 44 problems from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. An additional study showed that the proposed approach is less sensitive to noise in the data than boosting methods.

<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Mikhail Traskin</p><p>Abstract: The risk, or probability of error, of the classiﬁer produced by the AdaBoost algorithm is investigated. In particular, we consider the stopping strategy to be used in AdaBoost to achieve universal consistency. We show that provided AdaBoost is stopped after n1−ε iterations—for sample size n and ε ∈ (0, 1)—the sequence of risks of the classiﬁers it produces approaches the Bayes risk.

<p>Author: Yiming Ying, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances provide a rich family of Mercer kernels for learning algorithms. We show that the union of the unit balls of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces generated by Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli (uGC) class. This result conﬁrms a conjecture concerning learnability of Gaussian kernels and veriﬁes the uniform convergence of many learning algorithms involving Gaussians with changing variances. Rademacher averages and empirical covering numbers are used to estimate sample errors of multi-kernel regularization schemes associated with general loss functions. It is then shown that the regularization error associated with the least square loss and the Gaussian kernels can be greatly improved when ﬂexible variances are allowed. Finally, for regularization schemes generated by Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances we present explicit learning rates for regression with least square loss and classiﬁcation with hinge loss.

<p>Author: Jean-Yves Audibert, Olivier Bousquet</p><p>Abstract: There exist many different generalization error bounds in statistical learning theory. Each of these bounds contains an improvement over the others for certain situations or algorithms. Our goal is, ﬁrst, to underline the links between these bounds, and second, to combine the different improvements into a single bound. In particular we combine the PAC-Bayes approach introduced by McAllester (1998), which is interesting for randomized predictions, with the optimal union bound provided by the generic chaining technique developed by Fernique and Talagrand (see Talagrand, 1996), in a way that also takes into account the variance of the combined functions. We also show how this connects to Rademacher based bounds.

<p>Author: Philippe Rigollet</p><p>Abstract: We consider semi-supervised classiﬁcation when part of the available data is unlabeled. These unlabeled data can be useful for the classiﬁcation problem when we make an assumption relating the behavior of the regression function to that of the marginal distribution. Seeger (2000) proposed the well-known cluster assumption as a reasonable one. We propose a mathematical formulation of this assumption and a method based on density level sets estimation that takes advantage of it to achieve fast rates of convergence both in the number of unlabeled examples and the number of labeled examples.

<p>Author: François Laviolette, Mario Marchand</p><p>Abstract: We propose a PAC-Bayes theorem for the sample-compression setting where each classiﬁer is described by a compression subset of the training data and a message string of additional information. This setting, which is the appropriate one to describe many learning algorithms, strictly generalizes the usual data-independent setting where classiﬁers are represented only by data-independent message strings (or parameters taken from a continuous set). The proposed PAC-Bayes theorem for the sample-compression setting reduces to the PAC-Bayes theorem of Seeger (2002) and Langford (2005) when the compression subset of each classiﬁer vanishes. For posteriors having all their weights on a single sample-compressed classiﬁer, the general risk bound reduces to a bound similar to the tight sample-compression bound proposed in Laviolette et al. (2005). Finally, we extend our results to the case where each sample-compressed classiﬁer of a data-dependent ensemble may abstain of predicting a class label.

<p>Author: François Laviolette, Mario Marchand</p><p>Abstract: We propose a PAC-Bayes theorem for the sample-compression setting where each classiﬁer is described by a compression subset of the training data and a message string of additional information. This setting, which is the appropriate one to describe many learning algorithms, strictly generalizes the usual data-independent setting where classiﬁers are represented only by data-independent message strings (or parameters taken from a continuous set). The proposed PAC-Bayes theorem for the sample-compression setting reduces to the PAC-Bayes theorem of Seeger (2002) and Langford (2005) when the compression subset of each classiﬁer vanishes. For posteriors having all their weights on a single sample-compressed classiﬁer, the general risk bound reduces to a bound similar to the tight sample-compression bound proposed in Laviolette et al. (2005). Finally, we extend our results to the case where each sample-compressed classiﬁer of a data-dependent ensemble may abstain of predicting a class label.

<p>Author: Jia Li, Surajit Ray, Bruce G. Lindsay</p><p>Abstract: A new clustering approach based on mode identiﬁcation is developed by applying new optimization techniques to a nonparametric density estimator. A cluster is formed by those sample points that ascend to the same local maximum (mode) of the density function. The path from a point to its associated mode is efﬁciently solved by an EM-style algorithm, namely, the Modal EM (MEM). This method is then extended for hierarchical clustering by recursively locating modes of kernel density estimators with increasing bandwidths. Without model ﬁtting, the mode-based clustering yields a density description for every cluster, a major advantage of mixture-model-based clustering. Moreover, it ensures that every cluster corresponds to a bump of the density. The issue of diagnosing clustering results is also investigated. Speciﬁcally, a pairwise separability measure for clusters is deﬁned using the ridgeline between the density bumps of two clusters. The ridgeline is solved for by the Ridgeline EM (REM) algorithm, an extension of MEM. Based upon this new measure, a cluster merging procedure is created to enforce strong separation. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate that the mode-based clustering approach tends to combine the strengths of linkage and mixture-model-based clustering. In addition, the approach is robust in high dimensions and when clusters deviate substantially from Gaussian distributions. Both of these cases pose difﬁculty for parametric mixture modeling.

<p>Author: András György, Tamás Linder, Gábor Lugosi, György Ottucsák</p><p>Abstract: The on-line shortest path problem is considered under various models of partial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the loss of the chosen path (deﬁned as the sum of the weights of its composing edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by a quantity that is √ proportional to 1/ n and depends only polynomially on the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with complexity that is linear in the number of rounds n (i.e., the average complexity per round is constant) and in the number of edges. An extension to the so-called label efﬁcient setting is also given, in which the decision maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen path at a total of m n time instances. Another extension is shown where the decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along with simulation results are also presented.

<p>Author: Zakria Hussain, François Laviolette, Mario Marchand, John Shawe-Taylor, Spencer Charles Brubaker, Matthew D. Mullin</p><p>Abstract: Marchand and Shawe-Taylor (2002) have proposed a loss bound for the set covering machine that has the property to depend on the observed fraction of positive examples and on what the classiﬁer achieves on the positive training examples. We show that this loss bound is incorrect. We then propose a loss bound, valid for any sample-compression learning algorithm (including the set covering machine), that depends on the observed fraction of positive examples and on what the classiﬁer achieves on them. We also compare numerically the loss bound proposed in this paper with the incorrect bound, the original SCM bound and a recently proposed loss bound of Marchand and Sokolova (2005) (which does not depend on the observed fraction of positive examples) and show that the latter loss bounds can be substantially larger than the new bound in the presence of imbalanced misclassiﬁcations.

<p>Author: Yann Guermeur</p><p>Abstract: In the context of discriminant analysis, Vapnik’s statistical learning theory has mainly been developed in three directions: the computation of dichotomies with binary-valued functions, the computation of dichotomies with real-valued functions, and the computation of polytomies with functions taking their values in ﬁnite sets, typically the set of categories itself. The case of classes of vectorvalued functions used to compute polytomies has seldom been considered independently, which is unsatisfactory, for three main reasons. First, this case encompasses the other ones. Second, it cannot be treated appropriately through a na¨ve extension of the results devoted to the computation of ı dichotomies. Third, most of the classiﬁcation problems met in practice involve multiple categories. In this paper, a VC theory of large margin multi-category classiﬁers is introduced. Central in this theory are generalized VC dimensions called the γ-Ψ-dimensions. First, a uniform convergence bound on the risk of the classiﬁers of interest is derived. The capacity measure involved in this bound is a covering number. This covering number can be upper bounded in terms of the γ-Ψdimensions thanks to generalizations of Sauer’s lemma, as is illustrated in the speciﬁc case of the scale-sensitive Natarajan dimension. A bound on this latter dimension is then computed for the class of functions on which multi-class SVMs are based. This makes it possible to apply the structural risk minimization inductive principle to those machines.

<p>Author: Jia Li, Surajit Ray, Bruce G. Lindsay</p><p>Abstract: A new clustering approach based on mode identiﬁcation is developed by applying new optimization techniques to a nonparametric density estimator. A cluster is formed by those sample points that ascend to the same local maximum (mode) of the density function. The path from a point to its associated mode is efﬁciently solved by an EM-style algorithm, namely, the Modal EM (MEM). This method is then extended for hierarchical clustering by recursively locating modes of kernel density estimators with increasing bandwidths. Without model ﬁtting, the mode-based clustering yields a density description for every cluster, a major advantage of mixture-model-based clustering. Moreover, it ensures that every cluster corresponds to a bump of the density. The issue of diagnosing clustering results is also investigated. Speciﬁcally, a pairwise separability measure for clusters is deﬁned using the ridgeline between the density bumps of two clusters. The ridgeline is solved for by the Ridgeline EM (REM) algorithm, an extension of MEM. Based upon this new measure, a cluster merging procedure is created to enforce strong separation. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate that the mode-based clustering approach tends to combine the strengths of linkage and mixture-model-based clustering. In addition, the approach is robust in high dimensions and when clusters deviate substantially from Gaussian distributions. Both of these cases pose difﬁculty for parametric mixture modeling. A C package on the new algorithms is developed for public access at http://www.stat.psu.edu/∼jiali/hmac.

<p>Author: François Laviolette, Mario Marchand</p><p>Abstract: We propose a PAC-Bayes theorem for the sample-compression setting where each classiﬁer is described by a compression subset of the training data and a message string of additional information. This setting, which is the appropriate one to describe many learning algorithms, strictly generalizes the usual data-independent setting where classiﬁers are represented only by data-independent message strings (or parameters taken from a continuous set). The proposed PAC-Bayes theorem for the sample-compression setting reduces to the PAC-Bayes theorem of Seeger (2002) and Langford (2005) when the compression subset of each classiﬁer vanishes. For posteriors having all their weights on a single sample-compressed classiﬁer, the general risk bound reduces to a bound similar to the tight sample-compression bound proposed in Laviolette et al. (2005). Finally, we extend our results to the case where each sample-compressed classiﬁer of a data-dependent ensemble may abstain of predicting a class label.

<p>Author: Zakria Hussain, François Laviolette, Mario Marchand, John Shawe-Taylor, Spencer Charles Brubaker, Matthew D. Mullin</p><p>Abstract: Marchand and Shawe-Taylor (2002) have proposed a loss bound for the set covering machine that has the property to depend on the observed fraction of positive examples and on what the classiﬁer achieves on the positive training examples. We show that this loss bound is incorrect. We then propose a loss bound, valid for any sample-compression learning algorithm (including the set covering machine), that depends on the observed fraction of positive examples and on what the classiﬁer achieves on them. We also compare numerically the loss bound proposed in this paper with the incorrect bound, the original SCM bound and a recently proposed loss bound of Marchand and Sokolova (2005) (which does not depend on the observed fraction of positive examples) and show that the latter loss bounds can be substantially larger than the new bound in the presence of imbalanced misclassiﬁcations.

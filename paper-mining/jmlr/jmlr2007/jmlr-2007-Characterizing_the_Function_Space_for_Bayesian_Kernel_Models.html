<p>Author: Yiming Ying, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances provide a rich family of Mercer kernels for learning algorithms. We show that the union of the unit balls of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces generated by Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli (uGC) class. This result conﬁrms a conjecture concerning learnability of Gaussian kernels and veriﬁes the uniform convergence of many learning algorithms involving Gaussians with changing variances. Rademacher averages and empirical covering numbers are used to estimate sample errors of multi-kernel regularization schemes associated with general loss functions. It is then shown that the regularization error associated with the least square loss and the Gaussian kernels can be greatly improved when ﬂexible variances are allowed. Finally, for regularization schemes generated by Gaussian kernels with ﬂexible variances we present explicit learning rates for regression with least square loss and classiﬁcation with hinge loss.

<p>Author: Kenji Fukumizu, Francis R. Bach, Arthur Gretton</p><p>Abstract: While kernel canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has been applied in many contexts, the convergence of ﬁnite sample estimates of the associated functions to their population counterparts has not yet been established. This paper gives a mathematical proof of the statistical convergence of kernel CCA, providing a theoretical justiﬁcation for the method. The proof uses covariance operators deﬁned on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and analyzes the convergence of their empirical estimates of ﬁnite rank to their population counterparts, which can have inﬁnite rank. The result also gives a sufﬁcient condition for convergence on the regularization coefﬁcient involved in kernel CCA: this should decrease as n−1/3 , where n is the number of data.

<p>Author: Gavin C. Cawley, Nicola L. C. Talbot</p><p>Abstract: While the model parameters of a kernel machine are typically given by the solution of a convex optimisation problem, with a single global optimum, the selection of good values for the regularisation and kernel parameters is much less straightforward. Fortunately the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure can be performed or a least approximated very efﬁciently in closed form for a wide variety of kernel learning methods, providing a convenient means for model selection. Leave-one-out cross-validation based estimates of performance, however, generally exhibit a relatively high variance and are therefore prone to over-ﬁtting. In this paper, we investigate the novel use of Bayesian regularisation at the second level of inference, adding a regularisation term to the model selection criterion corresponding to a prior over the hyper-parameter values, where the additional regularisation parameters are integrated out analytically. Results obtained on a suite of thirteen real-world and synthetic benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the beneﬁt of this approach.

<p>Author: Marco Reisert, Hans Burkhardt</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new class of matrix valued kernels that are ideally suited to learn vector valued equivariant functions. Matrix valued kernels are a natural generalization of the common notion of a kernel. We set the theoretical foundations of so called equivariant matrix valued kernels. We work out several properties of equivariant kernels, we give an interpretation of their behavior and show relations to scalar kernels. The notion of (ir)reducibility of group representations is transferred into the framework of matrix valued kernels. At the end to two exemplary applications are demonstrated. We design a non-linear rotation and translation equivariant ﬁlter for 2D-images and propose an invariant object detector based on the generalized Hough transform.

<p>Author: Santosh Srivastava, Maya R. Gupta, Béla A. Frigyik</p><p>Abstract: Quadratic discriminant analysis is a common tool for classiﬁcation, but estimation of the Gaussian parameters can be ill-posed. This paper contains theoretical and algorithmic contributions to Bayesian estimation for quadratic discriminant analysis. A distribution-based Bayesian classiﬁer is derived using information geometry. Using a calculus of variations approach to deﬁne a functional Bregman divergence for distributions, it is shown that the Bayesian distribution-based classiﬁer that minimizes the expected Bregman divergence of each class conditional distribution also minimizes the expected misclassiﬁcation cost. A series approximation is used to relate regularized discriminant analysis to Bayesian discriminant analysis. A new Bayesian quadratic discriminant analysis classiﬁer is proposed where the prior is deﬁned using a coarse estimate of the covariance based on the training data; this classiﬁer is termed BDA7. Results on benchmark data sets and simulations show that BDA7 performance is competitive with, and in some cases signiﬁcantly better than, regularized quadratic discriminant analysis and the cross-validated Bayesian quadratic discriminant analysis classiﬁer Quadratic Bayes.

<p>Author: Natesh S. Pillai, Qiang Wu, Feng Liang, Sayan Mukherjee, Robert L. Wolpert</p><p>Abstract: Kernel methods have been very popular in the machine learning literature in the last ten years, mainly in the context of Tikhonov regularization algorithms. In this paper we study a coherent Bayesian kernel model based on an integral operator deﬁned as the convolution of a kernel with a signed measure. Priors on the random signed measures correspond to prior distributions on the functions mapped by the integral operator. We study several classes of signed measures and their image mapped by the integral operator. In particular, we identify a general class of measures whose image is dense in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) induced by the kernel. A consequence of this result is a function theoretic foundation for using non-parametric prior speciﬁcations in Bayesian modeling, such as Gaussian process and Dirichlet process prior distributions. We discuss the construction of priors on spaces of signed measures using Gaussian and L´ vy processes, e with the Dirichlet processes being a special case the latter. Computational issues involved with sampling from the posterior distribution are outlined for a univariate regression and a high dimensional classiﬁcation problem.

<p>Author: Jean-Yves Audibert, Olivier Bousquet</p><p>Abstract: There exist many different generalization error bounds in statistical learning theory. Each of these bounds contains an improvement over the others for certain situations or algorithms. Our goal is, ﬁrst, to underline the links between these bounds, and second, to combine the different improvements into a single bound. In particular we combine the PAC-Bayes approach introduced by McAllester (1998), which is interesting for randomized predictions, with the optimal union bound provided by the generic chaining technique developed by Fernique and Talagrand (see Talagrand, 1996), in a way that also takes into account the variance of the combined functions. We also show how this connects to Rademacher based bounds.

<p>Author: Gavin C. Cawley, Nicola L. C. Talbot</p><p>Abstract: While the model parameters of a kernel machine are typically given by the solution of a convex optimisation problem, with a single global optimum, the selection of good values for the regularisation and kernel parameters is much less straightforward. Fortunately the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure can be performed or a least approximated very efﬁciently in closed form for a wide variety of kernel learning methods, providing a convenient means for model selection. Leave-one-out cross-validation based estimates of performance, however, generally exhibit a relatively high variance and are therefore prone to over-ﬁtting. In this paper, we investigate the novel use of Bayesian regularisation at the second level of inference, adding a regularisation term to the model selection criterion corresponding to a prior over the hyper-parameter values, where the additional regularisation parameters are integrated out analytically. Results obtained on a suite of thirteen real-world and synthetic benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the beneﬁt of this approach.

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Philip M. Long, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning multiple tasks in parallel within the online learning framework. On each online round, the algorithm receives an instance for each of the parallel tasks and responds by predicting the label of each instance. We consider the case where the predictions made on each round all contribute toward a common goal. The relationship between the various tasks is deﬁned by a global loss function, which evaluates the overall quality of the multiple predictions made on each round. Speciﬁcally, each individual prediction is associated with its own loss value, and then these multiple loss values are combined into a single number using the global loss function. We focus on the case where the global loss function belongs to the family of absolute norms, and present several online learning algorithms for the induced problem. We prove worst-case relative loss bounds for all of our algorithms, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a largescale multiclass-multilabel text categorization problem.

<p>Author: Nicolás García-Pedrajas, César García-Osorio, Colin Fyfe</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel approach for ensemble construction based on the use of nonlinear projections to achieve both accuracy and diversity of individual classiﬁers. The proposed approach combines the philosophy of boosting, putting more effort on difﬁcult instances, with the basis of the random subspace method. Our main contribution is that instead of using a random subspace, we construct a projection taking into account the instances which have posed most difﬁculties to previous classiﬁers. In this way, consecutive nonlinear projections are created by a neural network trained using only incorrectly classiﬁed instances. The feature subspace induced by the hidden layer of this network is used as the input space to a new classiﬁer. The method is compared with bagging and boosting techniques, showing an improved performance on a large set of 44 problems from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. An additional study showed that the proposed approach is less sensitive to noise in the data than boosting methods.

<p>Author: Carine Hue, Marc Boullé</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the supervised learning task which consists in predicting the normalized rank of a numerical variable. We introduce a novel probabilistic approach to estimate the posterior distribution of the target rank conditionally to the predictors. We turn this learning task into a model selection problem. For that, we deﬁne a 2D partitioning family obtained by discretizing numerical variables and grouping categorical ones and we derive an analytical criterion to select the partition with the highest posterior probability. We show how these partitions can be used to build univariate predictors and multivariate ones under a naive Bayes assumption. We also propose a new evaluation criterion for probabilistic rank estimators. Based on the logarithmic score, we show that such criterion presents the advantage to be minored, which is not the case of the logarithmic score computed for probabilistic value estimator. A ﬁrst set of experimentations on synthetic data shows the good properties of the proposed criterion and of our partitioning approach. A second set of experimentations on real data shows competitive performance of the univariate and selective naive Bayes rank estimators projected on the value range compared to methods submitted to a recent challenge on probabilistic metric regression tasks. Our approach is applicable for all regression problems with categorical or numerical predictors. It is particularly interesting for those with a high number of predictors as it automatically detects the variables which contain predictive information. It builds pertinent predictors of the normalized rank of the numerical target from one or several predictors. As the criteria selection is regularized by the presence of a prior and a posterior term, it does not suffer from overﬁtting.

<p>Author: Robert Tibshirani, Trevor Hastie</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for the classiﬁcation of more than two classes, from high-dimensional features. Our approach is to build a binary decision tree in a top-down manner, using the optimal margin classiﬁer at each split. We implement an exact greedy algorithm for this task, and compare its performance to less greedy procedures based on clustering of the matrix of pairwise margins. We compare the performance of the “margin tree” to the closely related “all-pairs” (one versus one) support vector machine, and nearest centroids on a number of cancer microarray data sets. We also develop a simple method for feature selection. We ﬁnd that the margin tree has accuracy that is competitive with other methods and offers additional interpretability in its putative grouping of the classes.

<p>Author: Rocío Alaiz-Rodríguez, Alicia Guerrero-Curieses, Jesús Cid-Sueiro</p><p>Abstract: The design of a minimum risk classiﬁer based on data usually stems from the stationarity assumption that the conditions during training and test are the same: the misclassiﬁcation costs assumed during training must be in agreement with real costs, and the same statistical process must have generated both training and test data. Unfortunately, in real world applications, these assumptions may not hold. This paper deals with the problem of training a classiﬁer when prior probabilities cannot be reliably induced from training data. Some strategies based on optimizing the worst possible case (conventional minimax) have been proposed previously in the literature, but they may achieve a robust classiﬁcation at the expense of a severe performance degradation. In this paper we propose a minimax regret (minimax deviation) approach, that seeks to minimize the maximum deviation from the performance of the optimal risk classiﬁer. A neural-based minimax regret classiﬁer for general multi-class decision problems is presented. Experimental results show its robustness and the advantages in relation to other approaches. Keywords: classiﬁcation, imprecise class distribution, minimax regret, minimax deviation, neural networks 1. Introduction - Problem Motivation In the general framework of learning from examples and speciﬁcally when dealing with uncertainty, the robustness of the decision machine becomes a key issue. Most machine learning algorithms are based on the assumption that the classiﬁer will use data drawn from the same distribution as the training data set. Unfortunately, for most practical applications (such as remote sensing, direct marketing, fraud detection, information ﬁltering, medical diagnosis or intrusion detection) the target class distribution may not be accurately known during learning: for example, because the cost of labelling data may be class-dependent or the prior probabilities are non-stationary. Therefore, the data used to design the classiﬁer (within the Bayesian context (see VanTrees, 1968), the c 2007 Roc´o Alaiz-Rodr´guez, Alicia Guerrero-Curieses and Jesus Cid-Sueiro. ´ ı ı A LAIZ -RODR´GUEZ , G UERRERO -C URIESES , AND C ID -S UEIRO I prior probabilities and the misclassiﬁcation costs) may be non representative of the underlying real distributions. If the ratio of training data corresponding to each class is not in agreement with real class distributions, designing Bayes decision rules based on prior probabilities estimated from these data will be suboptimal and can seriously affect the reliability and performance of the classiﬁer. A similar problem may arise if real misclassiﬁcation costs are unknown during training. However, they are usually known by the end user, who can adapt the classiﬁer decision rules to cost changes without re-training the classiﬁer. For this reason, our attention in this paper is mainly focused on the problem of uncertainty in prior probabilities. Furthermore, being aware that class distribution is seldom known (at least totally) in real world applications, a robust approach (as opposite to adaptive) that prevents severe performance degradation appears to be convenient for these situations. Besides other adaptive and robust approaches that address this problem (discussed in more detail in Section 2.2) it is important to highlight those that handle the problem of uncertainty in priors by following a robust minimax principle: minimize the maximum possible risk. Analytic foundations of minimax classiﬁcation are widely considered in the literature (see VanTrees, 1968; Moon and Stirling, 2000; Duda et al., 2001, for instance) and a few algorithms to carry out minimax decisions have been proposed. From computationally expensive ones such as estimating probability density functions (Takimoto and Warmuth, 2000; Kim, 1996) or using methods from optimization (Polak, 1997) to simpler ones like neural network training algorithms (Guerrero-Curieses et al., 2004; AlaizRodriguez et al., 2005). Minimax classiﬁers may, however, be seen as over-conservative since its goal is to optimize the performance under the least favorable conditions. Consider, for instance, a direct marketing campaign application carried out in order to maximize proﬁts. Since optimal decisions rely on the proportion of potential buyers and it is usually unknown in advance, our classiﬁcation system should take into account this uncertainty. Nevertheless, following a pure minimax strategy can lead to solutions where minimizing the maximum loss implies considering there are no potential clients. If it is the case, this minimax approach does not seem to be suitable for this kind of situation. In this imprecise class distribution scenario, it can be noticed that the classiﬁer performance may be highly deviated from the optimal, that is, that of the classiﬁer knowing actual priors. Minimizing this gap (that is, the maximum possible deviation with respect to the optimal classiﬁer) is the focus of this paper. We seek for a system as robust as the conventional minimax approach but less pessimistic at the same time. We will refer to it as a minimax deviation (or minimax regret) classiﬁer. In contrast to other robust and adaptive approaches, it can be used in general multiclass problems. Furthermore, as shown in Guerrero-Curieses et al. (2004), minimax approaches can be used in combination with the adaptive proposal by Saerens et al. (2002) to exploit its advantages. This minimax regret approach has recently been applied in the context of parameter estimation (Eldar et al., 2004; Eldar and Merhav, 2004) and a similar competitive strategy has been used in the context of hypothesis testing (Feder and Merhav, 2002). Under prior uncertainty, our solution provides an upper bound of the performance divergence from the optimal classiﬁer. We propose a simple learning rate scaling algorithm in order to train a neural-based minimax deviation classiﬁer. Although training can be based on minimizing any objective function, we have chosen objective functions that provide estimates of the posterior probabilities (see Cid-Sueiro and Figueiras-Vidal, 2001, for more details). 104 M INIMAX R EGRET C LASSIFIER This paper is organized as follows: the next section provides an overview of the problem as well as some previous approaches to cope with it. Next, Section 3 states the fundamentals of minimax classiﬁcation together with a deeper analysis of the minimax regret approach proposed in this paper. Section 4 presents a neural training algorithm to get a neural-based minimax regret classiﬁer under complete uncertainty. Moreover, practical situations with partial uncertainty in priors are also discussed. A learning algorithm to solve them is provided in Section 5. In Section 6, some experimental results show that minimax regret classiﬁers outperform (in terms of maximum risk deviation) classiﬁers trained on re-balanced data sets and those with the originally assumed priors. Finally, the main conclusions are summarized in Section 7. 2. Problem Overview Traditionally, supervised learning lies in the fact that training data and real data come from the same (although unknown) statistical model. In order to carefully analyze to what extend classiﬁer performance depends on conditions such as class distribution or decision costs, learning and decision theory principles are brieﬂy revisited. Next, some previous approaches to deal with environment imprecision are reviewed. 2.1 Learning and Making Optimal Decisions Let S = {(xk , dk ), k = 1, . . . , K} denote a set of labelled samples where xk ∈ RN is an observation feature vector and dk ∈ UL = {u0 , . . . , uL−1 } is the label vector. Class-i label ui is a unit L-dimensional vector with components ui, j = δi j , with every component equal to 0, except the i-th component which is equal to 1. We assume a learning process that estimates parameters w of a non-linear mapping f w : RN → P from the input space into probability space P = {p ∈ [0, 1]L | ∑L−1 pi = 1}. The soft decision is given i=0 by yk = fw (xk ) ∈ P and the hard output of the classiﬁer is denoted by d. Note that d and d will be used to distinguish the actual class from the predicted one, respectively. Several costs (or beneﬁts) associated with each possible decision are also deﬁned: c i j denotes the cost of deciding in favor of class i when the true class is j. Negative values represent beneﬁts (for instance, cii , which is the cost of correctly classifying a sample from class i could be negative in some practical cases). In general cost-sensitive classiﬁcation problems, either misclassiﬁcation costs c i j or cii costs can take different values for each class. Thus, there are many applications where classiﬁcation errors lead to very different consequences (medical diagnosis, fault detection, credit risk analysis), what implies misclassiﬁcation costs ci j that may largely vary between them. In the same way, there are also many domains where correct decision costs (or beneﬁts) c ii do not take the same value. For instance, in targeted marketing applications (Zadrozny and Elkan, 2001), correctly identifying a buyer implies some beneﬁt while correctly classifying a non buyer means no income. The same ¨ applies to medical diagnosis domains such as the gastric carcinoma problem studied in G uvenir et al. (2004). In this case, the beneﬁt of correct classiﬁcation also depends on the class: the beneﬁt of correctly classifying an early stage tumor is higher than that of a later stage. The expected risk (or loss) R is given by L−1 L−1 R = ∑ ∑ ci j P{d = ui |d = u j }Pj j=0 i=0 105 , (1) A LAIZ -RODR´GUEZ , G UERRERO -C URIESES , AND C ID -S UEIRO I where P{d = ui |d = u j } with i = j represent conditional error probabilities, and P j = P{d = u j } is the prior probability of class u j . Deﬁning the conditional risk of misclassifying samples from class u j as L−1 Rj = ∑ ci j P{d = ui |d = u j } , i=0 we can express risk (1) as L−1 R= ∑ Ri Pi . (2) i=0 It is well-known that the Bayes decision rule for the minimum risk is given by L−1 d = arg min { ∑ ci j P{d = u j |x}} , ui (3) j=0 where P{d = ui |x} is the a posteriori probability of class i given sample x. The optimal decision rule depends on posterior probabilities and therefore, on the prior probabilities and the likelihood. In theory, as long as posterior probabilities (or likelihood and prior probabilities) are known, the optimal decision in Eq. (3) can be expressed after a trivial manipulation as a function of the cost differences between the costs (ci j − c j j ) (Duda et al., 2001). This is the reason why c j j is usually assumed to be zero and the value of the cost difference is directly assigned to c i j . When dealing ¨ with practical applications, however, some authors (Zadrozny and Elkan, 2001; G uvenir et al., 2004) have urged to use meaningful decision costs measured over a common baseline (and not necessarily taking c j j = 0) in order to avoid mistakes that otherwise could be overlooked. For this reason and, what is more important, the uncertainty class distribution problem addressed in this paper, decision costs measured over a common baseline are considered. Furthermore, absolute values of decision costs are relevant to the design of classiﬁers under the minimax regret approach. 2.2 Related Work: Dealing with Cost and Prior Uncertainty Most proposals to address uncertainty in priors fall into the categories of adaptive and robust solutions. While the aim of a robust solution is to avoid a classiﬁer with very poor performance under any conditions, an adaptive system pursues to ﬁt the classiﬁer parameters using more incoming data or more precise information. With an adaptive-oriented principle, Provost (2000) states that, once the classiﬁer is trained under speciﬁc class distributions and cost assumptions (not necessarily the operating conditions), the selection of the optimal classiﬁer for speciﬁc conditions is carried out by a correct placement of the decision thresholds. In the same way, the approaches in Kelly et al. (1999) and Kubat et al. (1998) consider that tuning the classiﬁer parameters should be left to the end user, expecting that class distributions and misclassiﬁcation costs will be precisely known then. Some graphical methods based on the ROC curve have been proposed in Adams and Hand (1998) and Provost and Fawcett (2001) in order to compare the classiﬁer performance under imprecise class distributions and/or misclassiﬁcation costs. The ROC convex hull method presented in Provost and Fawcett (2001) (or the alternative representation proposed in Drummond and Holte (2000)) allows the user to select potentially optimal classiﬁers, providing a ﬂexible way to select 106 M INIMAX R EGRET C LASSIFIER them when precise information about priors or costs is available. Under imprecision, some classiﬁers can be discarded but this does not necessarily provide a method to select the optimal classiﬁer between the possible ones and ﬁt its parameters. Furthermore, due to its graphical character, these methods are limited to binary classiﬁcation problems. Changes in prior probabilities have also been discussed by Saerens et al. (2002), who proposes a method based on re-estimating the prior probabilities of real data in an unsupervised way and subsequently adjusting the outputs of the classiﬁer according to the new a priori probabilities. Obviously, the method requires enough unlabelled data being available for re-estimation. As an alternative to adaptive schemes, several robust solutions have been proposed, as the resampling methods, especially in domains where imbalanced classes come out (Kubat and Matwin, 1997; Lawrence et al., 1998; Chawla et al., 2002; Barandela et al., 2003). Either by undersampling or oversampling, the common purpose is to balance artiﬁcially the training data set in order to get a uniform class distribution, which is supposed to be the least biased towards any class and, thus, the most robust against changes in class distributions. The same approach is followed in cost sensitive domains, but with some subtle differences in practice. It is well known that class priors and decision costs are intrinsically related. For instance, different decision costs can be simulated by altering the priors and vice versa (see Ting, 2002, for instance). Thus, when a uniform distribution is desired in a cost sensitive domain, but working with cost insensitive decision machines, class priors are altered according to decision costs, what is commonly referred as rebalancing. The manipulation of the training data distribution has been applied to cost-sensitive learning in two-class problems (Breiman et al., 1984) in the following way: basically, the class with higher misclassiﬁcation cost (suppose n times the lowest misclassiﬁcation cost) is represented with n times more examples than the other class. Besides random sampling strategies, other sampling-based rebalancing schemes have been proposed to accomplish this task, like those considering closeness to the boundaries between classes (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002; Zhou and LiuJ, 2006) or the costproportionate rejection sampling presented in Zadrozny et al. (2003). Extending the formulation of this type of procedures to general multiclass problems with multiple (and possibly asymmetric) inter-class misclassiﬁcation costs appears to be a nontrivial task (Zadrozny et al., 2003; Zhou and LiuJ, 2006), but some progress has been made recently with regard to this latter point (Abe et al., 2004). Note, also, that many (although not all) of these rebalancing strategies are usually implemented by oversampling and/or subsampling, that is, replicating examples (without adding any extra information) and/or deleting them (which implies information loss). 3. Robust Classiﬁers Under Prior Uncertainty: Minimax Classiﬁers Prior probability uncertainty can be coped from a robust point of view following a minimax derived strategy. Minimax regret criterion is discussed in this section after presenting the conventional minimax criterion. Although our approach extends to general multi-class problems and the discussion is carried out in that way, we will ﬁrst illustrate, for the sake of clarity and simplicity, a binary situation. 3.1 Minimax Classiﬁers As Eq. (3) shows, the minimum risk decisions depend on the misclassiﬁcation costs, c i j , and the posterior class probabilities and, thus, they depend on the prior probabilities, Pi . Different prior 107 A LAIZ -RODR´GUEZ , G UERRERO -C URIESES , AND C ID -S UEIRO I PSfrag replacements distributions (frequency for each class) give rise to different Bayes classiﬁers. Fig. 1 shows the Bayes risk curve, RB (P1 ) versus class-1 prior probability for a binary classiﬁcation problem. Standard RF (Q1 , P1 ) R0 Minimax RF (Q1mM , P1 ) Risk c00 Minimax Deviation RF (Q1mMd , P1 ) Rbasis R1 RB (P1 ) c11 0 Q1 Q1mM 1 Q1mMd P1 Figure 1: Risk vs. P1 . Minimum risk curve and performance under prior changes for the standard, minimax and minimax deviation classiﬁer. RB (P1 ) stands for the optimal Bayes Risk against P1 . RF (Q1 , P1 ) denotes the Risk of a standard classiﬁer (Fixed decision rule optimized for prior probabilities Q1 estimated in the training phase) against P1 . RF (Q1mM , P1 ) denotes the Risk of a minimax classiﬁer (Fixed decision rule optimized for the minimax probabilities Q1mM ) against P1 . RF (Q1mMd , P1 ) denotes the Risk of a minimax deviation classiﬁer (Fixed decision rule optimized for the minimax deviation probabilities Q 1mMd ) against P1 . If the prior probability distribution is unknown when the classiﬁer is designed, or this distribution changes with time or from one environment to other, the mismatch between training and test conditions can degrade signiﬁcantly the classiﬁer performance. For instance, assume that Q = (Q0 , Q1 ) is the vector with class-0 and class-1 prior probabilities estimated in the training phase, respectively, and let RB (Q1 ) represent the minimum (Bayes) risk attainable by any decision rule for these priors. Note, that, according to Eq. (2), for a given classiﬁer, the risk is a linear function of priors. Thus, risk RF (Q1 , P1 ) associated to the (ﬁxed) classiﬁer optimized for Q changes linearly with actual prior probabilities P1 and P0 = 1 − P1 , going from (0, R0 ) to (1, R1 ) (the continuous line in Fig. 1), where R0 and R1 refer to the class conditional risks for classes 0 and 1, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the impact of this change in priors and how performance deviates from optimal. Also, it can be shown (see VanTrees, 1968, for instance) that the minimum risk curve obtained for each prior is convex and the risk function of a given classiﬁer veriﬁes R F (Q1 , P1 ) ≥ RB (P1 ) with a tangent point at P1 = Q1 . 108 M INIMAX R EGRET C LASSIFIER The dashed line in Fig. 1 shows the performance of the minimax classiﬁer, which minimizes the maximum possible risk under the least favorable priors, thus providing the most robust solution, in the sense that performance becomes independent from priors. From Fig. 1, it becomes clear that the minimax classiﬁer is optimal for prior probabilities P = QmM = (Q0mM , Q1mM ) maximizing RB . Thus, this strategy is equivalent to maximizing the minimum risk (Moon and Stirling, 2000; Duda et al., 2001). We will refer to them as the minimax probabilities. Fig. 1 also makes clear that although a minimax classiﬁer is a robust solution to address the imprecision in priors, it may become a somewhat pessimistic approach. 3.2 Minimax Deviation Classiﬁers We propose an alternative classiﬁer that, instead of minimizing the maximum risk, minimizes the maximum deviation (regret) from the optimal Bayes classiﬁer. In the following, we will refer to it as the minimax deviation or minimax regret classiﬁer. A comparison between minimax and minimax deviation approaches is also shown in Fig. 1. This latter case corresponds to a classiﬁer trained on prior probabilities P = Q mMd with performance as a function of priors given by a line (a plane or hyperplane for three or more classes, respectively) parallel to what we name, in the following, basis risk (Rbasis = c00 (1 − P1 ) + c11 P1 ). Note that the maximum deviation (with respect to priors) of the classiﬁer optimized for Q is given by D(Q) = max {RF (Q1 , P1 ) − RB (P1 )} = max {R0 − c00 , R1 − c11 } . P1 The inspection of Fig. 1 shows that the minimum of D (with respect to Q) is achieved when R0 − c00 = R1 − c11 , which means that line RF (Q1 , P1 ) is parallel to arc named Rbasis in the ﬁgure and tangent to RB at Q1mMd . Therefore, the minimax regret classiﬁer is also the Bayes solution with respect to the least favorable priors (Q0mMd , Q1mMd ) (see Berger, 1985, for instance), which will be denoted as minimax deviation probabilities. Now, we extend the formulation to a general L-class problem. Deﬁnition 1 Consider a L-class decision problem with costs ci j , 0 ≤ i, j < L and c j j ≤ ci j , and let Rw (P) be the risk of a decision machine with parameter vector w when prior class probabilities are given by P = (P0 , . . . , PL−1 ). The deviation function is deﬁned as Dw (P) = Rw (P) − RB (P) and the minimax deviation is deﬁned as DmMd = inf max{Dw (P)} . w P (4) Note that the above deﬁnition assumes that the maximum exists. This is actually the case, since Dw (P) is a linear function over a compact set, P . Note, also, that our deﬁnition includes the natural assumption that c j j is never higher than ci j , meaning that making a decision error is always less costly than taking the correct decision. This assumption is used in part of our theoretical analysis. The algorithms proposed in this paper are based on the fact that the minimax deviation can be computed without knowing RB 109 A LAIZ -RODR´GUEZ , G UERRERO -C URIESES , AND C ID -S UEIRO I Theorem 2 The minimax deviation is given by DmMd = inf max{Dw (P)} , w P where Dw (P) = Rw (P) − Rbasis (P) and (5) L−1 ∑ c j j Pj Rbasis (P) = . (6) j=0 Proof Note that, according to Eqs. (1) and (2), for any decision machine and any u i ∈ UL , L−1 R(u j ) = R j = ∑ ci j P{d = ui |d = u j } ≥ c j j . i=0 Since the bound is reached by the classiﬁer deciding d = u j for any observation x, we have RB (u j ) = c j j . Therefore, using Eq. (6), we ﬁnd that, for any u ∈ UL , RB (u) = Rbasis (u) and, thus, Dw (u) = Dw (u) . Since Bayes minimum risk RB (P) is a convex function of priors and Rw (P) is linear, Dw (P) is concave and, thus, it is maximum at some of the vertices in P (i.e., at some P = u ∈ U L ). Thus, max{Dw (P)} = max {Dw (u)} . u∈UL P (7) Since the maximum difference between two hyperplanes deﬁned over P is always at some vertex, we can conclude that max{Dw (P)} = max {Dw (u)} = max {Dw (u)} . P u∈UL u∈UL (8) Combining Eqs. (4), (7) and (8), we get DmMd = inf max{Dw (P)} . w P Note that Rbasis represents the risk baseline of the ideal classiﬁer with zero errors. Th. 2 shows that the minimax regret can be computed as the minimax deviation to this ideal classiﬁer. Note, also, that if costs cii do not depend on i, Eq. (5) becomes equivalent (up to a constant) to the Bayes risk and the minimax regret classiﬁer becomes equivalent to the minimax classiﬁer . Another important result for the algorithms proposed in this paper is that, under some conditions on the minimum risk, the minimum and maximum operators can be permuted. Although general results on the permutability of minimum and maximum operators can be found in the literature (see Polak, 1997, for instance), we provide here the proof for the speciﬁc case interesting to this paper. 110 M INIMAX R EGRET C LASSIFIER Theorem 3 Consider the minimum deviation function given by Dmin (P) = inf{Dw (P)} , (9) w where Dw (P) is the normalized deviation function given by Eq. (5), and let P ∗ be the prior probability vector providing the maximum deviation, P∗ = arg max Dmin (P) P . (10) If Dmin (P) is continuously differentiable at P = P∗ , then the minimax deviation, DmMd , deﬁned by Eq. (4), is DmMd = Dmin (P∗ ) = max inf Dw (P) . (11) P w Proof For any classiﬁer with parameter vector w, we can write, max Dw (P) ≥ Dw (P∗ ) ≥ Dmin (P∗ ) P and, thus, inf max Dw (P) ≥ Dmin (P∗ ) . w P (12) Therefore, Dmin (P∗ ) is a lower bound of the minimax regret. Now we prove that Dmin (P∗ ) is also an upper bound. According to Eq. (9), for any ε > 0, there exists a parameter vector wε such that Dwε (P∗ ) ≤ Dmin (P∗ ) + ε . (13) By deﬁnition, for any P, Dmin (P) ≤ Dwε (P). Therefore, using Eq. (13), we can write Dwε (P∗ ) − Dwε (P) ≤ Dmin (P∗ ) − Dmin (P) + ε . (14) Since Dmin (P) is continuously differentiable and (according to Eq. (10)) maximum at P ∗ , for any ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that, for any P ∈ P with P∗ − P ≤ δ we have Dmin (P∗ ) − Dmin (P) ≤ ε P∗ − P ≤ ε δ . (15) Let Pδ a prior such that P∗ − Pδ = δ. Taking ε = ε δ and combining Eqs. (14) and (15) we can write Dwε (P∗ ) − Dwε (Pδ ) ≤ 2ε δ . Since the above condition is veriﬁed for any ε > 0 and any prior Pδ at distance δ from P, and taking into account that Dwε (P) is a linear function of P, we conclude that the maximum slope of D wε (P) is bounded by 2ε and, thus, for any P ∈ P , we have √ Dwε (P) − Dwε (P∗ ) ≤ 2ε P − P∗ ≤ 2 2ε , √ (where we have used the fact that the maximum distance between two probability vectors is 2). Therefore, we can write √ max Dwε (P) ≤ Dwε (P∗ ) + 2 2ε P 111 A LAIZ -RODR´GUEZ , G UERRERO -C URIESES , AND C ID -S UEIRO I and, thus, √ inf max Dw (P) ≤ Dwε (P∗ ) + 2 2ε . w P √ Finally, using Eq. (13) and taking into account that ε = ε δ ≤ 2ε we get √ inf max Dw (P) ≤ Dmin (P∗ ) + 3 2ε . w P (16) Since the above is true for any ε > 0 we conclude that Dmin (P∗ ) is also an upper bound of Dw . Therefore, combining Eqs. (12) and (16), we conclude that inf max Dw (P) = Dmin (P∗ ) , w P which completes the proof. Note that the deviation function needs to be neither differentiable nor a continuous function of w parameters. If the minimum deviation function is not continuously differentiable at the minimax deviation probability, P∗ , the theorem cannot be applied. The reason is that, although there should exist at least one classiﬁer providing the minimum deviation at P = P∗ , it or they could not provide a constant deviation with respect to the prior probability. The situation can be illustrated with an example. Let x ∈ R be given by p(x|d = 0) = 0.8N(x, σ) + 0.2N(x − 2, σ) and p(x|d = 1) = 0.2N(x − 1, σ) + 0.8N(x − 3, σ), where σ = 0.5 and N(x, σ) = (2πσ)−1/2 exp(−x2 /(2σ2 )), and consider the set Φλ of classiﬁers given by a single threshold over x and decision dˆ = 1 if x ≥ λ 0 if x < λ. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of both classes over x, and Fig. 3 shows, as a function of priors, the minimum error probability (continuous line) that can be obtained using classiﬁers in Φ λ . Note that decision costs c00 = c11 = 0 and c01 = c10 = 1 have been considered for this illustrative problem. An abrupt slope change is observed at the minimax deviation probability, for P{d = 1} = 1/2. For this prior, there are two single threshold classiﬁers providing the minimum error probability, which are given by thresholds λ1 and λ2 in Fig. 2. However, as shown in Fig. 3 neither of them provides a risk that is constant in the prior. The minimax deviation classiﬁer in Φ λ , which has a threshold λ0 , does not attain minimum risk at the minimax deviation probability and, thus, cannot be obtained by using Eq. (11). For this example, the desired robust classiﬁer should have a deviation function given by the horizontal dotted line in Fig. 3. Fortunately, it can be obtained by combining the outputs of several classiﬁers. For instance, let dˆ1 and dˆ2 the decisions of classiﬁers given by thresholds λ1 and λ2 , respectively. It is not difﬁcult to see that the classiﬁer selecting dˆ1 and dˆ2 at random (for each input sample x) provides a robust classiﬁer. This procedure can be extended to the multiclass-case: consider a set of L classiﬁers with parameters wk , k = 0, . . . , L − 1, and consider the classiﬁer such that, for any input sample x, makes a decision equal to dk (i.e., the decision of classiﬁer with parameters wk ), with probability qk . It is not difﬁcult to show that the deviation function of this classiﬁer is given by L−1 D(P) = L−1 j=0 k=0 ∑ Pj ∑ qk D j (wk ) 112 , M INIMAX R EGRET C LASSIFIER 0.7 0.6 Likelihoods 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 λ 0 −2 λ −1 0 λ 0 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 x Figure 2: The conditional data distributions for the one-dimensional example discussed in the text. λ1 and λ2 are the thresholds providing the minimum risk at the minimax deviation probability. λ0 provides the minimax deviation classiﬁer. where D j (wk ) = R j (wk ) − c j j . In order to get a constant deviation function, probabilities q k should be chosen in such a way that L−1 ∑ qk D j (wk ) = D , k=0 where D is a constant. Solving these linear equations for q k , k = 0, . . . , L − 1 (with the constraint ∑k qk = 1), the required probabilities can be found. Note that, in order to build the non-deterministic classiﬁer providing a constant deviation, a set of L independent classiﬁers that are optimal at the minimax deviation prior should be found. However, we go no further on the investigation of this special case for two main reasons: • The situation does not seem to be common in practice. In our simulations, we have found that the maximum of the minimum risk deviation always provided a response which is approximately parallel to Rbasis . • In general, the abrupt change in the derivative may be a symptom that the classiﬁer structure is not optimal for the data distribution. Instead of building a nondeterministic classiﬁer, increasing the classiﬁer complexity should be more efﬁcient. Although the least favorable prior providing the minimax deviation can be computed in closed form for some simple distributions, in general, it must be computed numerically. Moreover, we assume here that the data distribution is not known, and must be learned from examples. Thus, 113 A LAIZ -RODR´GUEZ , G UERRERO -C URIESES , AND C ID -S UEIRO I 0.25 0.2 λ Error probability 0 0.15 λ λ 1 2 0.1 0.05 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 P{ d=1} Figure 3: Error probabilities as a function of prior probability of class 1 for the example in Fig. 2. Thresholds λ1 and λ2 do not provide the minimax deviation classiﬁer, which is obtained for threshold λ0 . However, the random combination of classiﬁers with thresholds λ 1 and λ2 (dotted line) provides a robust classiﬁer with deviation lower than that of λ 0 . we must incorporate the estimation of the least favorable prior in the learning process. Next, we propose a training algorithm in order to get a minimax regret classiﬁer based on neural networks. 4. Neural Robust Classiﬁers Under Complete Uncertainty Note that, if QmMd is the probability vector providing the maximum in Eq. (11), that is, QmMd = arg max inf{Dw (P)} w P , then we can write DmMd = inf{Dw (QmMd )} . w Therefore, the minimax deviation classiﬁer can be estimated by training a classiﬁer using prior in QmMd . For this reason, QmMd will be called the minimax deviation prior (or least favorable prior). Our proposed algorithms are based on an iterative process of estimating parameters w based on an estimate of the minimax deviation prior, and re-estimating prior based on an estimate of network weights. This is shown in the following. 114 M INIMAX R EGRET C LASSIFIER 4.1 Updating Network Weights Learning is based on minimizing some empirical estimate of the overall error function L−1 L−1 i=0 E{C(y, d)} = i=0 ∑ P{d = ui }E{C(y, d)|d = ui } = ∑ PiCi , where C(y, d) may be any error function and Ci is the expected conditional error for class-i. Selecting the appropriate error function (see Cid-Sueiro and Figueiras-Vidal, 2001, for instance), learning rules can be designed providing a posteriori probability estimates (y i ≈ P{d = ui |x}, where yi is the soft decision) and, thus, according to Eq. (3), the hard decision minimizing the risk can be approximated by L−1 d = arg min { ∑ ci j y j } . i j=0 The overall empirical error function (cost function) used in learning for priors P = (P0 , . . . , PL−1 ) may be written as L−1 C = ∑ PiCi = L−1 i=0 = = 1 K L−1 i=0 1 K k ∑ d C(yk , dk ), Ki k=1 i Pi K k ∑ d C(yk , dk ) Ki /K k=1 i ∑ i=0 1 K ∑ K k=1 ∑ Pi L−1 ∑ Pi d kC(yk , dk ) (0) i i=0 Pi , , (17) (0) where Pi = Ki /K is an initial estimate of class-i prior based on class frequencies in the training set and Pi is the current prior estimate. Minimizing error function (17) by means of a stochastic gradient descent learning rule leads to update the network weights at k-th iteration as w (k+1) = w (k) (n) L−1 −µ = w(k) − Pi i=0 Pi ∑ L−1 d k ∇ C(yk , dk ) (0) i w ∑ µi (n) k di , ∇wC(yk , dk ) , (18) i=0 where (n) (n) µi = µ Pi (19) (0) Pi (n) is a learning step scaled by the prior ratio. Note that di selects the appropriate µi according to the pattern class membership. The classiﬁer is trained without altering the original training data set (0) class distribution Pi and therefore, without missing or duplicating information. 115 A LAIZ -RODR´GUEZ , G UERRERO -C URIESES , AND C ID -S UEIRO I 4.2 Updating Prior Probabilities Eq. (11) shows that the learning process should maximize (5) with respect to the prior probabilities. The estimate of (5) can be computed as ¯ Dw (P) = Rw (P) − Rbasis (P) , where (20) L−1 ∑ R j Pj (21) 1 L−1 ∑ ci j Ni j N j i=0 (22) Rw (P) = j=0 is the overall Bayes risk estimate and Rj = is the class- j conditional risk estimate where N j is the number of class u j patterns in the training phase and Ni j is the number of samples from class u j assigned to ui . L−1 In order to derive a learning rule to ﬁnd an estimate Pi satisfying constraints ∑i=0 Pi = 1 and 0 ≤ Pi ≤ 1, we will use auxiliary variables Bi such that Pi = exp(Bi ) L−1 ∑ j=0 exp(B j ) . (23) ¯ We maximize Dw with respect to Bi . Applying the chain rule, ¯ ¯ ∂Dw L−1 ∂Dw ∂Pj =∑ , ∂Bi j=0 ∂Pj ∂Bi and using Eqs. (20), (21) and (23), we get ¯ ∂D w ∂Bi L−1 = ∑ (R j − c j j )Pi (δi j − Pj ), j=0 L−1 L−1 j=0 j=0 = Pi Ri − cii − ∑ (R j Pj ) + ∑ (c j j Pj ) , = Pi Ri − cii − Rw − Rbasis , = Pi Rdi , where Rdi = (Ri − cii ) − (Rw − Rbasis ) . The learning rule for auxiliary variable Bi is (n) Bi (n+1) = Bi + ρ (n) ∂D w , ∂Bi (n) (n) = Bi + ρPi Rdi , 116 (24) M INIMAX R EGRET C LASSIFIER where parameter ρ > 0 controls the rate of convergence. Using Eq. (23) and Eq.

(25) 4.3 Training Algorithm for a Minimax Deviation Classiﬁer In the previous section, both the network weights updating rule (18) and the prior probability update rule (25) have been derived.

Robust Classiﬁers Under Partial Uncertainty Although in many practical situations prior probabilities may not be speciﬁed with precision, they can be partially known. In this section we discuss how partial information about priors can be used to improve the classiﬁer performance in relation to a complete uncertainty situation. From now on, let us consider that lower (or upper) bounds of the priors are known based on previous experience. We will denote the lower and upper bounds of class-i prior probability as Pil and Piu , respectively. In order to illustrate this situation consider a binary classiﬁcation problem where probability lower bounds P0l and P1l are known. That is, P1 ∈ [P1l , 1 − P0l ] where this interval represents the uncertainty region. Let us denote by Γ = {P : 0 ≤ Pi ≤ 1, ∑L−1 Pi = 1, Pi ≥ Pil } the probability region i=0 satisfying the imposed constraints. In the following, we will refer to Γ as the uncertainty region. Now, the aim is to design a classiﬁer that minimizes the maximum regret from the minimum risk only inside the uncertainty region. This is depicted in Fig. 4(a), which shows that reducing the uncertainty in priors allows to reduce deviation from the optimal classiﬁer. This minimax regret approach for the uncertainty region Γ is often called Γ-minimax regret. As discussed before, the minimax deviation solution gives a Bayes solution with respect some priors denoted in the partial uncertainty case as QΓ mMd in Fig. 4(a), which is the least favorable distribution according to the regret criterion. 117 A LAIZ -RODR´GUEZ , G UERRERO -C URIESES , AND C ID -S UEIRO I cΓ 00 RΓ basis RΓ 1 cΓ 11 PSfrag replacements Risk 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 0P1l RB (P) + ψ(P) Minimax Deviation with Restriction Risk RΓ 0 QΓ 1mMd 1 − P0l 1 P1 0P1l 1 − P0l 1 P1 (b) (a) Figure 4: Minimax deviation classiﬁer under partial uncertainty of prior probabilities: (a)Γ-minMaxDev Classiﬁer.

In contrast to the minimax regret criterion, note that a classical minimax classiﬁer for the considered uncertainty region would minimize the worst-case risk. It would be a Bayes solution for the prior where the minimum risk reaches its maximum and it could be denoted as Q Γ . mM Notice, also, that these solutions will be the same if the risk for the vertex of Γ take the same value (cΓ = k). ii 5.1 Neural Robust Classiﬁers Under Partial Uncertainty Minimax search can be formulated as maximizing (with respect to priors) the minimum (with respect to network parameters) of deviation function (5), as described in previous section, but subject to some constraints arg max inf {DΓ (P)} , w w P Pi ≥ Pil , i = 0, . . . , L − 1 s.t. where DΓ = RΓ − RΓ . When uncertainty is global, this hyperplane is deﬁned by the risk in the L w w basis extreme cases with Pi = δik , that is, by the corresponding cii . However, with partial knowledge of the prior probabilities, this hyperplane becomes deﬁned by the risk in L points which are the vertex given by the restrictions and with associated risk denoted by c Γj . j Deﬁning 1 l(Pi ) = , (26) 1 + exp−τ(Pi −Pil ) where τ controls the hardness of this restriction, the minimax problem can be re-formulated as arg max inf {DΓ (P)} w P s.t. w l(Pi ) ≥ 1/2, i = 0, . . . , L − 1. Thus, this constrained optimization problem can be solved as a non-constrained problem by considering an auxiliary function that incorporates the restriction as a barrier function 118 M INIMAX R EGRET C LASSIFIER arg max inf {DΓ (P) + Aψ(P)} , w w P where ψ(Pi ) = log(l(Pi )) and the constant A determines the contribution of the barrier function. Fig. 4(b) shows the new risk function corresponding to the binary case previously depicted in Fig. 4(a). Note that, it is the sum of the original RB (P) and the barrier function ψ(P). As in Section 4.1, in order to derive the network weight learning rule, we need to compute ∂ψ ∂Bi L−1 = ∂ψ ∂P j , j ∂Bi ∑ ∂P j=0 = τPi L−1 ∑ 1 − l(Pk ) (δik − Pk ), k=0 = τPi ψdi , where ψdi = ∑L−1 (1 − l(Pk ))(δik − Pk ) k=0 As τ increases, the constraints become harder around the speciﬁed bound. The update learning rule for the auxiliary variable Bi at cycle n is (n+1) Bi (n) Γ(n) (n) (n) = Bi (n) + ρPi Rdi + ρAτPi ψdi . And therefore, using (23), the update learning rule for Pi is (n) (n+1) Pi = (n) Γ(n) Pi exp ρPi Rdi L−1 ∑ (n) Pj exp (n) (n) exp ρAτPi ψdi (n) Γ(n) ρ P j Rd j . (n) (n) ρAτPj ψd j exp j=0 Note that if the upper bound is known instead of the lower bound, l(Pi ) deﬁned by (26) should be replaced by u(Pi ) = (1 + exp(τ(Pi − Piu )))−1 at the previous formulation. The minimax constrained optimization problem has been tackled by considering a new objective function deﬁned by the sum of the original cost function and a barrier function. Studying the convexity of this new function becomes important from the fact that a stationary point of this risk curve is a global maximum. Since the minimum risk curve (RB (P)) is a convex function of the priors (see VanTrees, 1968, for details), if we verify the convexity of the barrier function, we can conclude that the function deﬁned by the sum of both of them is also convex. This barrier function is convex in P if the Hessian matrix HR veriﬁes PT HR P ≤ 0 The Hessian matrix of the barrier function equals to a diagonal matrix D r = diag(r) with all negative diagonal entries ri = Aτ2 (−l(Pi )(1 − l(Pi ))). As l(Pi ) ∈ [0, 1] and therefore, ri ≤ 0, it is straightforward to see that PT HR P = PT Dr P, L−1 = ∑ Pi2 ri ≤ 0 . i=0 Since the barrier function is convex, the new objective function (deﬁned by the sum of two convex functions) is also convex. 119 A LAIZ -RODR´GUEZ , G UERRERO -C URIESES , AND C ID -S UEIRO I 5.2 Extension to Other Learning Algorithms The learning algorithm proposed in this paper is intended to train a minimax deviation classiﬁer based on neural networks with feedforward architecture. Actually, the learning algorithm we propose becomes a feasible solution for any learning process based on minimizing some empirical estimate of an overall cost (error) function. However, it is also applicable to a general classiﬁer provided it is trained (in an iterative process) for the estimated minimax deviation probabilities and the assumed decision costs. Speciﬁcally, in this paper, scaling the learning rate allows to simulate different class distributions and the hard decisions are made based on posterior probability estimates and decision costs. Furthermore, the neural learning phase carried out in one iteration can be re-used for the next one, what allows to reduce computational cost with respect to a complete optimization process on each iteration. Apart from the general approach of completely training a classiﬁer on each iteration and in order to reduce its computational cost, speciﬁc solutions may be studied for different learning machines. Nonetheless, it seems not feasible to readily achieve this improvement for classiﬁers like SVMs, where support vectors for one solution may have nothing in common with the ones obtained in next iteration and thus, making necessary to re-train the classiﬁer in each iteration. Another possible solution for any classiﬁer that provides a posteriori probabilities estimates or any score that can be converted into probabilities (for details on calibration methods see Wei et al., 1999; Zadrozny and Elkan, 2002; Niculescu-Mizil and Caruana, 2005) is outlined here. In this case, an iterative procedure able to estimate the minimax deviation probabilities and consequently to adjust (without re-training) the outputs of the classiﬁer could be studied. The general idea for this approach is as follows: ﬁrst, the new minimax deviation prior probabilities are estimated according to (25) and then, posterior probabilities provided by the model are adjusted as follows (see Saerens et al., 2002, for more details) (k) Pi P(k) {d = ui |x} = P(k−1) {d = ui |x} (k−1) Pi L−1 P(k) j P(k−1) {d = u j |x} (k−1) j=0 Pj . (27) ∑ The algorithm’s main structure is summarized as for k = 1 to K do (k) Estimate R(k) , Ri , i = 0, . . . , L − 1, according to (21), (22) and decision costs c i j (k+1) Update minimax probability Pi according to (25) Adjust classiﬁer outputs according to (27) end for The effectiveness of this method relies on the accuracy of the initial a posteriori probability estimates. Studying in depth this approach and comparing different minimax deviation classiﬁers (decision trees, SVMs, RBF networks, feedforward networks and committee machines) together with different probability calibration methods appears as a challenging issue to be explored in future work. 120 M INIMAX R EGRET C LASSIFIER 6. Experimental Results In this section, we ﬁrst present the neural network architecture used in the experiments and illustrate the proposed minimax deviation strategy on an artiﬁcial data set. Then, we apply it to several realworld classiﬁcation problems. Moreover, a comparison with other proposals such as the traditional minimax and the common re-balancing approach is carried out. 6.1 Softmax-based Network Although our algorithms can be applied to any classiﬁer architecture, we have chosen a neural network based on the softmax non-linearity with soft decisions given by Mi yi = ∑ yi j , j=1 with yi j = exp(wTj x + wi j0 ) i , Mk ∑L−1 ∑l=1 exp(wT x + wkl0 ) k=0 kl where L stands for the number of classes, M j the number of softmax outputs used to compute y j and wi j are weight vectors. We will refer to this network as a Generalized Softmax Perceptron(GSP). 1 A simple network with M j = 2 is used in the experiments. x1 wj,k y1,1 y1,... x2 x3 y1 y1,M1 Class i ... SOFTMAX ... HARD DECISION n inputs / outputs ... yL,1 xd yL,ML yL,... yL Figure 5: GSP(Generalized Softmax Perceptron) Network Fig. 5 corresponds to the neural network architecture used to classify the samples represented by feature vector x. Learning consists of estimating network parameters w by means of the stochastic gradient minimization of certain objective functions. In the experiments, we have considered the Cross Entropy objective function given by L CE(y, d) = − ∑ di log yi . i=1 The stochastic gradient learning rule for the GSP network is given by Eq. (18). Learning step µ(0) decreases according to µ(k) = 1+k/η , where k is the iteration number, µ(0) the initial learning rate and η a decay factor. µ(k) 1. Note that the GSP is similar to a two layer MLP with a single layer of weights and with coupled saturation function (softmax), instead of sigmoidal units. 121 A LAIZ -RODR´GUEZ , G UERRERO -C URIESES , AND C ID -S UEIRO I The reason to illustrate this approach with a feedforward architecture is that, as mentioned in Section 5.2, it allows to exploit (in the iterative learning process) the partially optimized solution in current iteration for the next one. On the other hand, posterior probability estimation makes it possible to apply the adaptive strategy based on prior re-estimation proposed by Saerens to the minimax deviation classiﬁer, as long as a data set representative of the operation conditions is available. Finally, the fact that intermediate outputs yi j of the GSP can be interpreted as subclass probabilities may provide quite a natural way to cope with the unexplored problem of uncertainty in subclass distributions as already pointed out by Webb and Ting (2005). Nonetheless, both architecture and cost function issues are not the goal of this paper, but merely illustrative tools. 6.2 Artiﬁcial Data Set To illustrate the minimax regret approach proposed in this paper both under complete and partial uncertainty, an artiﬁcial data set with two classes (class u0 and class u1 ) has been created. Data examples are drawn from the normal distribution p(x|d = ui ) = N(mi , σ2 ) with mean mi and standard i √ deviation σi . Mean values were set to m0 = 0, m1 = 2 and standard deviation to σ0 = σ1 = 2. A total of 4000 instances were generated with prior probabilities of class membership P{d = u 0 } = 0.93 c00 c01 2 5 and P{d = u1 } = 0.07. The cost-beneﬁt matrix is given by . c10 c11 4 0 Initial learning rate was set to µ(0) = 0.3, decay factor to η = 2000 and training was ended after 80 cycles. Classiﬁer assessment was carried out by following 10-fold cross-validation. Two classiﬁers were trained, to be called a standard classiﬁer and a minMaxDev classiﬁer. The former is built by considering that the estimated class prior information is precise and stationary and the latter is the approach proposed in this paper to cope with uncertainty in priors. Thus, for the standard classiﬁer, its performance may deviate from the optimal risk in 3.39 when priors change from training to test conditions. However, a minimax deviation classiﬁer reduces this worst-case difference from the optimal classiﬁer to 0.77. Now, we suppose that some information about priors is available (partial uncertainty). For instance, we consider that the lower bound for prior probabilities P0 and P1 are known and set to P0l = 0.55 and P1l = 0.05, respectively, so that the uncertainty region is Γ = {(P0 , P1 )|P0 ∈ [0.55, 0.95], P1 ∈ [0.05, 0.45]}. A minimax deviation classiﬁer can be derived for Γ (it will be called Γ-minMaxDev classiﬁer).The narrower Γ is, the closer the minimax deviation classiﬁer performance is to the optimal. For this particular case, under partially imprecise priors, the standard classiﬁer may differ from optimal (in Γ) in 0.83, while the use of the simple minMaxDev classiﬁer designed under total prior uncertainty conditions attains a maximum deviation of 0.53. However, the Γ-minMaxDev classiﬁer only differs from optimal in 0.24. These data are reported in Table 1 where both, experimental and also theoretical results, are shown. 6.3 Real Databases In this section we report experimental results obtained with several publicly available data sets.

Class-conditional risk deviations (R i − cii ) reported for the minMaxDev classiﬁer. Experimental results for these data sets are shown in the following sections. The robustness of different decision machines under complete uncertainty of prior probabilities is analyzed in Section 6.3.1. If uncertainty is only partial, a similar study and comparison with the previous approach (complete uncertainty) is carried out in Section 6.3.2. 6.3.1 C LASSIFIER ROBUSTNESS U NDER C OMPLETE U NCERTAINTY We now study how different neural-based classiﬁers cope with worst-case situations in prior probabilities. The maximum deviation from the optimal classiﬁer (see Table 4) is reported for the proposed minMaxDev strategy as well as for other alternative approaches: the one based on the assumption of stationary priors (standard) and the common alternative of deriving the classiﬁer from an equally distributed data set (re-balanced). A comparison with the traditional minimax strategy is also provided. Together with the previously mentioned value (maximum deviation or regret), deviation for the L class-conditional extreme cases (Ri − cii ) is also reported for the minMaxDev classiﬁer in Table 4. Results allow to verify that this solution is fairly close to the optimal one where deviation is not dependent on priors and thus, class-conditional deviations take the same value. Although the balanced class distribution to train the classiﬁer can be obtained by means of undersampling and/or oversampling, it is simulated by altering the learning rate used in the training 1/L phase according to (19) as µi = µ (0) , where 1/L represents the simulated probability, equal for Pi all classes. Results evidence that the assumption of stationary priors may lead to signiﬁcant deviations from the optimal decision rule under “unexpected”, but rather realistic, prior changes. This deviation may reach up to three times more than the robust minimax deviation strategy. Thus, for classiﬁcation problems like Page-blocks the maximum deviation from the optimal classiﬁer is 0.62 for the 124 M INIMAX R EGRET C LASSIFIER Standard Maximum Risk Re-balanced Minimax Deviation minMaxDev Minimax minMax GCRE 0.70 0.15 0.60 0.00 ACRE 0.01 0.02 0.86 -0.00 MCRE 0.05 0.20 0.59 0.00 COIL 0.76 0.99 0.86 0.02 DNA 0.34 0.53 0.25 0.13 PAG 0.62 0.26 0.20 0.10 DER -2.10 -1.68 -2.21 -2.38 PEN 0.061 0.059 0.029 0.029 Table 5: Classiﬁer Performance measured as Maximum Risk for several real-world applications. standard classiﬁer while this reduces to 0.20 for the minMaxDev one. Likewise, for the Insurance company(COIL) application the maximum deviation for the standard classiﬁer is 2.78 compared with 0.92 for the minMaxDev model. The remaining databases also show the same behavior as it is presented in Table 4. On the other hand, the use of a classiﬁer inferred from a re-balanced data set does not necessarily involve a decrease in the maximum deviation with respect to the standard classiﬁer. In the same way, the traditional minimax classiﬁer does not protect against prior changes in terms of maximum relative deviation from the minimum risk classiﬁer. However, if our criterion is more conservative and our aim is the minimization of the maximum possible risk (not the minimization of the deviation), the traditional minimax classiﬁer represents the best option. It is shown in Table 5 where the maximum risk for the different classiﬁers is reported. Positive values in this table indicate a cost while negative values represent a beneﬁt. For instance, for the Page-blocks application the minimax classiﬁer assures a maximum risk of 0.10 while the standard, re-balanced and minMaxDev classiﬁers reach values of 0.62, 0.26 and 0.20, respectively. It can be noticed that for the Pen-digits data set, the minimax deviation and minimax approaches attain the same results. The reason is that, for this problem, the R basis plane takes the same value (in this case, zero) in the probability space. 6.3.2 C LASSIFIER ROBUSTNESS UNDER PARTIAL U NCERTAINTY Unlike the previous section, we consider now that partial information about the class priors is available. The aim is to ﬁnd a classiﬁer that behaves well for a delimited and realistic range of priors what constitutes an aid in reducing the maximum deviation from the optimal classiﬁer. This situation can be treated as a constrained minimax regret strategy where the constraints represent any extra information about prior probability value. Experimental results for several situations of partial prior uncertainty are presented in this section. We consider that lower bounds for the prior probabilities are available (see Table 6). In order to get the Γ-minMaxDev classiﬁer, the risk for the different vertex of the uncertainty domain needs to be calculated. With them, the basis risk RΓ over which deviations are measured is derived. basis 125 A LAIZ -RODR´GUEZ , G UERRERO -C URIESES , AND C ID -S UEIRO I Lower bound for prior probabilities Data Set P0l P1l GCRE 0.40 0.25 ACRE 0.20 0.25 MCRE 0.20 0.25 COIL 0.15 P2l P3l P4l P5l 0.03 DNA 0.10 0.10 0.22 0.02 0.00 0.01 0.1 0.20 0.10 0.10 0.10 0.10 0.06 0.06 0.10 0.10 0.06 P9l 0.06 0.10 0.05 0.05 0.02 PEN P8l 0.02 DER P7l 0.25 PAG P6l Table 6: Lower bounds for prior probabilities deﬁning the uncertainty region, Γ region for the experimental data sets.

Class-conditional risk deviations (RΓ − cΓ ) are reported for the Γ-minMaxDev classiﬁer. i ii Maximum deviation from the optimal in Γ is reported for the Γ-minMaxDev classiﬁer together with the standard and the minMaxDev ones. For instance, the standard classiﬁer for the Pageblocks data set deviates from the optimal classiﬁer, in the deﬁned uncertainty region, up to 0.37, while when complete uncertainty is assumed the maximum deviation is equal to 0.62. In the same way, reducing the uncertainty also means a reduction in the maximum deviation for minMaxDev classiﬁer (trained without considering this partial knowledge). Thus, for Γ, this classiﬁer assures a deviation bound of 0.15. However, taking into account this partial information to train a Γ-minMaxDev classiﬁer allows to reduce the deviation for the worst-case conditions to 0.10. It can be seen the same behavior for the other databases in Table 7. 126 M INIMAX R EGRET C LASSIFIER 7. Conclusions This work concerns the design of robust neural-based classiﬁers when the prior probabilities of the classes are partially or completely unknown, even by the end user. This problem of uncertainty in the class priors is often ignored in supervised classiﬁcation, even though it is a widespread situation in real world applications. As a result, the reliability of the inducted classiﬁer can be greatly affected as previously shown by the experiments. To tackle this problem, we have proposed a novel minimax deviation strategy with the goal to minimize the maximum deviation with respect to the optimal classiﬁer. A neural network training algorithm based on learning rate scaling has been developed. The experimental results show that this minimax deviation (minMaxDev) classiﬁer protects against prior changes while other approaches like ignoring this uncertainty or use a balanced learning data set may result in large differences in performance with respect to the minimum risk classiﬁer. Also, it has been shown that the conventional minimax classiﬁer reduces the maximum possible risk following a conservative attitude but at the expense of large worst-case differences from the optimal classiﬁer. Furthermore, a constrained minimax deviation approach (Γ-minMaxDev) has been derived for those situations where uncertainty is only partial. This may be seen as a general approach with some particular cases: a) precise knowledge of prior probabilities and b) complete uncertainty about the priors. In a) the region of uncertainty collapses to a point and we have the Bayes’ rule of minimum risk and in b) the pure minimax deviation strategy comes up. While the ﬁrst one may be criticized for being quite unrealistic, the other may be seen rather pessimistic. The experimental results for this proposed intermediate situation show that the Γ-minMaxDev classiﬁer allows to reduce the maximum deviation from the optimal and performs well over a range of prior probabilities.

<p>Author: Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Sridhar Mahadevan</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is a general framework for scaling reinforcement learning (RL) to problems with large state and action spaces by using the task (or action) structure to restrict the space of policies. Prior work in HRL including HAMs, options, MAXQ, and PHAMs has been limited to the discrete-time discounted reward semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) model. The average reward optimality criterion has been recognized to be more appropriate for a wide class of continuing tasks than the discounted framework. Although average reward RL has been studied for decades, prior work has been largely limited to ﬂat policy representations. In this paper, we develop a framework for HRL based on the average reward optimality criterion. We investigate two formulations of HRL based on the average reward SMDP model, both for discrete-time and continuous-time. These formulations correspond to two notions of optimality that have been previously explored in HRL: hierarchical optimality and recursive optimality. We present algorithms that learn to ﬁnd hierarchically and recursively optimal average reward policies under discrete-time and continuous-time average reward SMDP models. We use two automated guided vehicle (AGV) scheduling tasks as experimental testbeds to study the empirical performance of the proposed algorithms. The ﬁrst problem is a relatively simple AGV scheduling task, in which the hierarchically and recursively optimal policies are different. We compare the proposed algorithms with three other HRL methods, including a hierarchically optimal discounted reward algorithm and a recursively optimal discounted reward algorithm on this problem. The second problem is a larger AGV scheduling task. We model this problem using both discrete-time and continuous-time models. We use a hierarchical task decomposition in which the hierarchically and recursively optimal policies are the same for this problem. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithms</p><p>same-paper 2 0.68322045 <a title="16-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2007-Boosted_Classification_Trees_and_Class_Probability_Quantile_Estimation.html">16 jmlr-2007-Boosted Classification Trees and Class Probability Quantile Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Mease, Abraham J. Wyner, Andreas Buja</p><p>Abstract: The standard by which binary classiﬁers are usually judged, misclassiﬁcation error, assumes equal costs of misclassifying the two classes or, equivalently, classifying at the 1/2 quantile of the conditional class probability function P[y = 1|x]. Boosted classiﬁcation trees are known to perform quite well for such problems. In this article we consider the use of standard, off-the-shelf boosting for two more general problems: 1) classiﬁcation with unequal costs or, equivalently, classiﬁcation at quantiles other than 1/2, and 2) estimation of the conditional class probability function P[y = 1|x]. We ﬁrst examine whether the latter problem, estimation of P[y = 1|x], can be solved with LogitBoost, and with AdaBoost when combined with a natural link function. The answer is negative: both approaches are often ineffective because they overﬁt P[y = 1|x] even though they perform well as classiﬁers. A major negative point of the present article is the disconnect between class probability estimation and classiﬁcation. Next we consider the practice of over/under-sampling of the two classes. We present an algorithm that uses AdaBoost in conjunction with Over/Under-Sampling and Jittering of the data (“JOUS-Boost”). This algorithm is simple, yet successful, and it preserves the advantage of relative protection against overﬁtting, but for arbitrary misclassiﬁcation costs and, equivalently, arbitrary quantile boundaries. We then use collections of classiﬁers obtained from a grid of quantiles to form estimators of class probabilities. The estimates of the class probabilities compare favorably to those obtained by a variety of methods across both simulated and real data sets.

<p>Author: Sridhar Mahadevan, Mauro Maggioni</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel spectral framework for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) by jointly learning representations and optimal policies. The major components of the framework described in this paper include: (i) A general scheme for constructing representations or basis functions by diagonalizing symmetric diffusion operators (ii) A speciﬁc instantiation of this approach where global basis functions called proto-value functions (PVFs) are formed using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian on an undirected graph formed from state transitions induced by the MDP (iii) A three-phased procedure called representation policy iteration comprising of a sample collection phase, a representation learning phase that constructs basis functions from samples, and a ﬁnal parameter estimation phase that determines an (approximately) optimal policy within the (linear) subspace spanned by the (current) basis functions. (iv) A speciﬁc instantiation of the RPI framework using least-squares policy iteration (LSPI) as the parameter estimation method (v) Several strategies for scaling the proposed approach to large discrete and continuous state spaces, including the Nystr¨ m extension for out-of-sample interpolation of eigenfunctions, and the use of Kronecker o sum factorization to construct compact eigenfunctions in product spaces such as factored MDPs (vi) Finally, a series of illustrative discrete and continuous control tasks, which both illustrate the concepts and provide a benchmark for evaluating the proposed approach. Many challenges remain to be addressed in scaling the proposed framework to large MDPs, and several elaboration of the proposed framework are brieﬂy summarized at the end.

<p>Author: Saher Esmeir, Shaul Markovitch</p><p>Abstract: The majority of existing algorithms for learning decision trees are greedy—a tree is induced topdown, making locally optimal decisions at each node. In most cases, however, the constructed tree is not globally optimal. Even the few non-greedy learners cannot learn good trees when the concept is difﬁcult. Furthermore, they require a ﬁxed amount of time and are not able to generate a better tree if additional time is available. We introduce a framework for anytime induction of decision trees that overcomes these problems by trading computation speed for better tree quality. Our proposed family of algorithms employs a novel strategy for evaluating candidate splits. A biased sampling of the space of consistent trees rooted at an attribute is used to estimate the size of the minimal tree under that attribute, and an attribute with the smallest expected tree is selected. We present two types of anytime induction algorithms: a contract algorithm that determines the sample size on the basis of a pre-given allocation of time, and an interruptible algorithm that starts with a greedy tree and continuously improves subtrees by additional sampling. Experimental results indicate that, for several hard concepts, our proposed approach exhibits good anytime behavior and yields signiﬁcantly better decision trees when more time is available.

<p>Author: Peng Zhao, Bin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Many statistical machine learning algorithms minimize either an empirical loss function as in AdaBoost, or a penalized empirical loss as in Lasso or SVM. A single regularization tuning parameter controls the trade-off between ﬁdelity to the data and generalizability, or equivalently between bias and variance. When this tuning parameter changes, a regularization “path” of solutions to the minimization problem is generated, and the whole path is needed to select a tuning parameter to optimize the prediction or interpretation performance. Algorithms such as homotopy-Lasso or LARS-Lasso and Forward Stagewise Fitting (FSF) (aka e-Boosting) are of great interest because of their resulted sparse models for interpretation in addition to prediction. In this paper, we propose the BLasso algorithm that ties the FSF (e-Boosting) algorithm with the Lasso method that minimizes the L1 penalized L2 loss. BLasso is derived as a coordinate descent method with a ﬁxed stepsize applied to the general Lasso loss function (L1 penalized convex loss). It consists of both a forward step and a backward step. The forward step is similar to e-Boosting or FSF, but the backward step is new and revises the FSF (or e-Boosting) path to approximate the Lasso path. In the cases of a ﬁnite number of base learners and a bounded Hessian of the loss function, the BLasso path is shown to converge to the Lasso path when the stepsize goes to zero. For cases with a larger number of base learners than the sample size and when the true model is sparse, our simulations indicate that the BLasso model estimates are sparser than those from FSF with comparable or slightly better prediction performance, and that the the discrete stepsize of BLasso and FSF has an additional regularization effect in terms of prediction and sparsity. Moreover, we introduce the Generalized BLasso algorithm to minimize a general convex loss penalized by a general convex function. Since the (Generalized) BLasso relies only on differences</p><p>6 0.38668716 <a title="16-lda-6" href="./jmlr-2007-Transfer_Learning_via_Inter-Task_Mappings_for_Temporal_Difference_Learning.html">85 jmlr-2007-Transfer Learning via Inter-Task Mappings for Temporal Difference Learning</a></p>

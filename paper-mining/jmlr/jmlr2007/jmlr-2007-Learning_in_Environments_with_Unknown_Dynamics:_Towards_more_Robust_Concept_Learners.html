<h1>48 jmlr-2007-Learning in Environments with Unknown Dynamics: Towards more Robust Concept Learners</h1>

<p>Author: J. Zico Kolter, Marcus A. Maloof</p><p>Abstract: We present an ensemble method for concept drift that dynamically creates and removes weighted experts in response to changes in performance. The method, dynamic weighted majority (DWM), uses four mechanisms to cope with concept drift: It trains online learners of the ensemble, it weights those learners based on their performance, it removes them, also based on their performance, and it adds new experts based on the global performance of the ensemble. After an extensive evaluation— consisting of ﬁve experiments, eight learners, and thirty data sets that varied in type of target concept, size, presence of noise, and the like—we concluded that DWM outperformed other learners that only incrementally learn concept descriptions, that maintain and use previously encountered examples, and that employ an unweighted, ﬁxed-size ensemble of experts.

<p>Author: Ray J. Hickey</p><p>Abstract: To provide good classification accuracy on unseen examples, a decision tree, learned by an algorithm such as ID3, must have sufficient structure and also identify the correct majority class in each of its leaves. If there are inadequacies in respect of either of these, the tree will have a percentage classification rate below that of the maximum possible for the domain, namely (100 Bayes error rate). An error decomposition is introduced which enables the relative contributions of deficiencies in structure and in incorrect determination of majority class to be isolated and quantified. A sub-decomposition of majority class error permits separation of the sampling error at the leaves from the possible bias introduced by the attribute selection method of the induction algorithm. It is shown that sampling error can extend to 25% when there are more than two classes. Decompositions are obtained from experiments on several data sets. For ID3, the effect of selection bias is shown to vary from being statistically non-significant to being quite substantial, with the latter appearing to be associated with a simple underlying model.

<p>Author: Tapani Raiko, Harri Valpola, Markus Harva, Juha Karhunen</p><p>Abstract: We introduce standardised building blocks designed to be used with variational Bayesian learning. The blocks include Gaussian variables, summation, multiplication, nonlinearity, and delay. A large variety of latent variable models can be constructed from these blocks, including nonlinear and variance models, which are lacking from most existing variational systems. The introduced blocks are designed to ﬁt together and to yield efﬁcient update rules. Practical implementation of various models is easy thanks to an associated software package which derives the learning formulas automatically once a speciﬁc model structure has been ﬁxed. Variational Bayesian learning provides a cost function which is used both for updating the variables of the model and for optimising the model structure. All the computations can be carried out locally, resulting in linear computational complexity. We present experimental results on several structures, including a new hierarchical nonlinear model for variances and means. The test results demonstrate the good performance and usefulness of the introduced method.

<p>Author: Saher Esmeir, Shaul Markovitch</p><p>Abstract: The majority of existing algorithms for learning decision trees are greedy—a tree is induced topdown, making locally optimal decisions at each node. In most cases, however, the constructed tree is not globally optimal. Even the few non-greedy learners cannot learn good trees when the concept is difﬁcult. Furthermore, they require a ﬁxed amount of time and are not able to generate a better tree if additional time is available. We introduce a framework for anytime induction of decision trees that overcomes these problems by trading computation speed for better tree quality. Our proposed family of algorithms employs a novel strategy for evaluating candidate splits. A biased sampling of the space of consistent trees rooted at an attribute is used to estimate the size of the minimal tree under that attribute, and an attribute with the smallest expected tree is selected. We present two types of anytime induction algorithms: a contract algorithm that determines the sample size on the basis of a pre-given allocation of time, and an interruptible algorithm that starts with a greedy tree and continuously improves subtrees by additional sampling. Experimental results indicate that, for several hard concepts, our proposed approach exhibits good anytime behavior and yields signiﬁcantly better decision trees when more time is available.

<p>Author: Moshe Koppel, Jonathan Schler, Elisheva Bonchek-Dokow</p><p>Abstract: In the authorship verification problem, we are given examples of the writing of a single author and are asked to determine if given long texts were or were not written by this author. We present a new learning-based method for adducing the “depth of difference” between two example sets and offer evidence that this method solves the authorship verification problem with very high accuracy. The underlying idea is to test the rate of degradation of the accuracy of learned models as the best features are iteratively dropped from the learning process.

<p>Author: Marlon Núñez, Raúl Fidalgo, Rafael Morales</p><p>Abstract: In the process of concept learning, target concepts may have portions with short-term changes, other portions may support long-term changes, and yet others may not change at all. For this reason several local windows need to be handled. We suggest facing this problem, which naturally exists in the ﬁeld of concept learning, by allocating windows which can adapt their size to portions of the target concept. We propose an incremental decision tree that is updated with incoming examples. Each leaf of the decision tree holds a time window and a local performance measure as the main parameter to be controlled. When the performance of a leaf decreases, the size of its local window is reduced. This learning algorithm, called OnlineTree2, automatically adjusts its internal parameters in order to face the current dynamics of the data stream. Results show that it is comparable to other batch algorithms when facing problems with no concept change, and it is better than evaluated methods in its ability to deal with concept drift when dealing with problems in which: concept change occurs at different speeds, noise may be present and, examples may arrive from different areas of the problem domain (virtual drift).

<p>Author: Gaëlle Loosli, Stéphane Canu</p><p>Abstract: In a recently published paper in JMLR, Tsang et al. (2005) present an algorithm for SVM called Core Vector Machines (CVM) and illustrate its performances through comparisons with other SVM solvers. After reading the CVM paper we were surprised by some of the reported results. In order to clarify the matter, we decided to reproduce some of the experiments. It turns out that to some extent, our results contradict those reported. Reasons of these different behaviors are given through the analysis of the stopping criterion.

<p>Author: Ryan M. Rifkin, Ross A. Lippert</p><p>Abstract: Regularization is an approach to function learning that balances ﬁt and smoothness. In practice, we search for a function f with a ﬁnite representation f = ∑i ci φi (·). In most treatments, the ci are the primary objects of study. We consider value regularization, constructing optimization problems in which the predicted values at the training points are the primary variables, and therefore the central objects of study. Although this is a simple change, it has profound consequences. From convex conjugacy and the theory of Fenchel duality, we derive separate optimality conditions for the regularization and loss portions of the learning problem; this technique yields clean and short derivations of standard algorithms. This framework is ideally suited to studying many other phenomena at the intersection of learning theory and optimization. We obtain a value-based variant of the representer theorem, which underscores the transductive nature of regularization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We unify and extend previous results on learning kernel functions, with very simple proofs. We analyze the use of unregularized bias terms in optimization problems, and low-rank approximations to kernel matrices, obtaining new results in these areas. In summary, the combination of value regularization and Fenchel duality are valuable tools for studying the optimization problems in machine learning.

<p>Author: J. Zico Kolter, Marcus A. Maloof</p><p>Abstract: We present an ensemble method for concept drift that dynamically creates and removes weighted experts in response to changes in performance. The method, dynamic weighted majority (DWM), uses four mechanisms to cope with concept drift: It trains online learners of the ensemble, it weights those learners based on their performance, it removes them, also based on their performance, and it adds new experts based on the global performance of the ensemble. After an extensive evaluation— consisting of ﬁve experiments, eight learners, and thirty data sets that varied in type of target concept, size, presence of noise, and the like—we concluded that DWM outperformed other learners that only incrementally learn concept descriptions, that maintain and use previously encountered examples, and that employ an unweighted, ﬁxed-size ensemble of experts.

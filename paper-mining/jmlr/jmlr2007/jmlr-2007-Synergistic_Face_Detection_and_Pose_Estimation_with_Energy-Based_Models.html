<p>Author: Chao-Chun Liu, Dao-Qing Dai, Hong Yan</p><p>Abstract: Face recognition is a challenging problem due to variations in pose, illumination, and expression. Techniques that can provide effective feature representation with enhanced discriminability are crucial. Wavelets have played an important role in image processing for its ability to capture localized spatial-frequency information of images. In this paper, we propose a novel local discriminant coordinates method based on wavelet packet for face recognition to compensate for these variations. Traditional wavelet-based methods for face recognition select or operate on the most discriminant subband, and neglect the scattered characteristic of discriminant features. The proposed method selects the most discriminant coordinates uniformly from all spatial frequency subbands to overcome the deﬁciency of traditional wavelet-based methods. To measure the discriminability of coordinates, a new dilation invariant entropy and a maximum a posterior logistic model are put forward. Moreover, a new triangle square ratio criterion is used to improve classiﬁcation using the Euclidean distance and the cosine criterion. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust for face recognition under variations in illumination, pose and expression.

<p>Author: Kristen Grauman, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: In numerous domains it is useful to represent a single example by the set of the local features or parts that comprise it. However, this representation poses a challenge to many conventional machine learning techniques, since sets may vary in cardinality and elements lack a meaningful ordering. Kernel methods can learn complex functions, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences—generally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function called the pyramid match that measures partial match similarity in time linear in the number of features. The pyramid match maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in order to ﬁnd implicit correspondences based on the ﬁnest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair ﬁrst appears. We show the pyramid match yields a Mercer kernel, and we prove bounds on its error relative to the optimal partial matching cost. We demonstrate our algorithm on both classiﬁcation and regression tasks, including object recognition, 3-D human pose inference, and time of publication estimation for documents, and we show that the proposed method is accurate and signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than current approaches.

<p>Author: Sébastien Gadat, Laurent Younes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new model addressing feature selection from a large dictionary of variables that can be computed from a signal or an image. Features are extracted according to an efﬁciency criterion, on the basis of speciﬁed classiﬁcation or recognition tasks. This is done by estimating a probability distribution P on the complete dictionary, which distributes its mass over the more efﬁcient, or informative, components. We implement a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, using the probability as a state variable and optimizing a multi-task goodness of ﬁt criterion for classiﬁers based on variable randomly chosen according to P. We then generate classiﬁers from the optimal distribution of weights learned on the training set. The method is ﬁrst tested on several pattern recognition problems including face detection, handwritten digit recognition, spam classiﬁcation and micro-array analysis. We then compare our approach with other step-wise algorithms like random forests or recursive feature elimination.

<p>Author: Aggelos Chariatis</p><p>Abstract: The experimental investigation on the efﬁcient learning of highly non-linear problems by online training, using ordinary feed forward neural networks and stochastic gradient descent on the errors computed by back-propagation, gives evidence that the most crucial factors for efﬁcient training are the hidden units’ differentiation, the attenuation of the hidden units’ interference and the selective attention on the parts of the problems where the approximation error remains high. In this report, we present global and local selective attention techniques and a new hybrid activation function that enables the hidden units to acquire individual receptive ﬁelds which may be global or local depending on the problem’s local complexities. The presented techniques enable very efﬁcient training on complex classiﬁcation problems with embedded subproblems. Keywords: neural networks, online training, selective attention, activation functions, receptive ﬁelds 1. Framework Online supervised learning is in many cases the only practical way of learning. This includes situations where the problem size is very big, or situations where we have a non-recurring stream of input vectors that are unavailable before training begins. We examine online supervised learning using a particular class of adaptive models, the very popular feed forward neural networks, trained with stochastic gradient descent on the errors computed by back-propagation. In order to easily visualize the online training dynamics of highly complex non linear problems, we are experimenting on 2:η:1 networks where the input is a point in a two dimensional image and the output is the value of the pixel at the corresponding input position. This framework allows the creation of very complex non-linear problems, just by hand-drawing the problem on a bitmap and presenting it to the network. Most problems’ images in this report are 256 × 256 pixels in size, producing in total 65536 different samples each one. Classiﬁcation and regression problems can be modeled as black & white and gray scale images respectively. In this report we only examine training on classiﬁcation problems. However, since mixed problems are possible, we are only interested on techniques that can be applied to both classiﬁcation and regression. The target of this investigation is online training where the input is not known in advance, so the input samples are treated as random and non-recurring vectors from the input space and are discarded after being used. We select and train on random samples until the average classiﬁcation or RMS error is acceptable. Since both the number of training exemplars and the complexity of the underlying function are assumed unknown, we require from our training mechanism to have “initial state invariance” as a fundamental property. Thus we deliberately exclude from our arsenal any c 2007 Aggelos Chariatis. C HARIATIS training techniques that require a schedule to be decided ahead of training. Ideally we would like from the training mechanism to be totally invariant to the initial training parameters and network state. This report is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 describe techniques for global and local selective attention. Section 4 is devoted to acceleration of training. In Section 5 we present experimental results and in Section 6 we discuss the presented techniques and give some directions for future research. Finally, Appendix A contains a description of the notations that have been used. In Figure 1 you can see some examples of problems that can be learned very efﬁciently using the techniques that are presented in the following sections. (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Figure 1: Examples of complex non-linear problems that can be learned efﬁciently. 2. Global Selective Attention - Dynamic Training Set Evolution Consider the two problems depicted in Figure 2. Clearly, both problems are of approximately equal complexity, since they encapsulate the same image in a different scale and position within the input space. We would like to have a mechanism that will make the network capable of learning both problems at about the same speed. (a) (b) Figure 2: Approximately equal complexity problems. Intuitively, the samples on the boundaries, which are the samples on positions with the highest contrast, are those that determine the complexity of each problem. During training, these samples have the property that they produce the highest errors. We thus need a method that will focus attention on samples with high error relatively to the rest. Previous work on such global selective attention has been published by many authors (Munro, 1987; Yu and Simmons, 1990; Bakker, 1992, 1993; Schapire, 1999; Zhong and Ghosh, 2000). 2018 V ERY FAST O NLINE L EARNING OF H IGHLY N ON L INEAR P ROBLEMS Of particular interest are the various boosting algorithms, such as AdaBoost (Schapire, 1999), which work by placing more emphasis on training samples that the system is currently getting wrong. Unfortunately, the most successful of these algorithms require a predeﬁned set of samples on which training will be performed, something that is excluded from our scenario. Nevertheless, in a less constrained scenario, boosting can be applied on top of our techniques as a meta-learning algorithm, using our techniques as the base-learning algorithm. A simple method that can provide such an adaptive selective attention mechanism, by keeping an exponential trace of the average error in the training set, is described in Algorithm 1. e←0 ¯ Repeat Pick a random sample Evaluate the error e for the sample If e > 0.5 e ¯ e ← e α + e (1 − α) ¯ ¯ Train End Until a stopping criterion is satisﬁed In this report’s context, error evaluation and train are deﬁned as: Error Evaluation: Computation of the output values by forward propagating the activations from the input to the output layer for a single sample, plus computation of the output errors. The sample’s error e is set to the quadratic mean (RMS) of the output units’ errors. Train: Back-propagation of the output errors to the hidden layer and immediate weights’ adjustment. Algorithm 1: The dynamic training set evolution algorithm. The algorithm evaluates the errors of all samples, but trains only for samples with error greater than half the average error of the current training set. Training is initially performed for all samples, but gradually, it is concentrated on the samples at the problem’s boundaries. When the error for these samples is reduced, other previously excluded samples enter the training set. Thus, samples enter and leave the training set automatically, with a tendency to train on samples with high error. The magnitude of the constant α that determines the time scale of the exponential trace is problem speciﬁc, but in all experiments in this report it was kept ﬁxed to 10 −4 . The fraction of 0.5 was determined experimentally to give a good balance between sample selectivity and training set size. If it is close to 0 then we train for almost all samples. If it is close to 1 then we are at risk of making the training set starve from samples. Of course, one can choose to vary it dynamically in order to have a ﬁxed percentage of samples in the training set, or, to not allow the training percentage to fall below a pre-speciﬁed limit. Figure 3 shows the training set evolution for the two-spirals problem (in Figure 1a) in various training stages. The network topology was 2:64:1. You can see the training set forming gradually and tracing the problem boundaries where the error is the highest. One could argue that such a process may be very sensitive to outliers. Experiments have shown that this does not happen. The algorithm does not try to recognize the outliers, but at least, adjusts naturally by not allowing the training set size to shrink. So, at the presence of heavy noise, the algorithm becomes ineffective, but does not introduce any additional harm. Figure 4 shows the two2019 C HARIATIS 10000-11840-93% 20000-25755-76% 40000-66656-41% 60000-142789-22% 90000-296659-18% Figure 3: Training set evolution for the two-spirals problem.

You can see that the algorithm tolerates noise by not allowing the training set size to shrink. It is also interesting that at noise levels as high as 30% the algorithm can still exclude large areas of the input space from training. 10%-42% 20%-62% 30%-75% 50%-93% 70%-99% Figure 4: Top row shows the model with a visualization of the applied dynamic noise.

Local Selective Attention - Receptive Fields Having established a global method to focus attention on the important parts of a problem, we now come to address the main issue, which is the network training. Let ﬁrst discuss the roles of the hidden and output layers in a feed forward neural network with a single hidden layer and without shortcut input-to-output connections. 2020 V ERY FAST O NLINE L EARNING OF H IGHLY N ON L INEAR P ROBLEMS The hidden layer is responsible for transforming a non linear input-to-output mapping, into a non linear input-to-hidden layer mapping, that can be mapped linearly to the output. The output layer is responsible for learning a linear hidden-to-output mapping (which is an easy job), but most importantly, it must provide to the hidden layer error gradient information that will be used for the error credit assignment problem. In this respect, it becomes apparent that all hidden units should receive the most possibly accurate error information. That is why, we must train all hidden to output connections and back propagate the error through all these connections. This is not the case for the hidden layer. Consider, for a classiﬁcation problem, how the hidden units with sigmoidal activations partition the input space into sub areas. By adjusting the input-tohidden weights and biases, each hidden unit develops a hyperplane that bi-partitions the input space in the most useful sense. We would like to limit the number of hyperplanes in order to reduce the system’s available degrees of freedom and obtain better generalization capabilities. At the same time, we would like to thoroughly use them in order to optimize the input output approximation. This can be done by arranging the hyperplanes to touch the problem’s boundaries at regular intervals dictated by the boundary curvature, as it is shown in Figure 5a. Figure 5b, shows a suboptimal placement of the hyperplanes which causes a waste of resources. Each hidden unit must be differentiated from the others and ideally not interfere with the subproblems that the other units are trying to solve. Suppose that two hidden units are governed by the same, or nearly the same, parameters. How can we differentiate them? There are many possibilities. (a) (b) Figure 5: Optimal vs. suboptimal hyperplanes. One could be, to just throw one unit away and make the output weight of the other equal to the sum of the two original output weights. That would leave the function unchanged. However, identifying these similar units during training is not easy computationally. In addition, we would have to ﬁgure out a method that would compute the best initial placement for the hyperplane of the new unit that would substitute the one that was thrown away. Another possibility would be to add noise in the weight updates, gradually reduced with a simulated annealing schedule which should be decided before training begins. Unfortunately, the loss of initial state invariance would complicate training for unknown complex non linear problems. To our thinking, it is much better to embed constraints into the system, so that it will not be possible for two hidden units to develop the same hyperplane. Two computationally efﬁcient techniques to embed such constraints are described in sections 3.1 and 3.2. Many other authors have also examined methods for local selective attention. For the related discussions see Huang and Huang (1990), Ahmad and Omohundro (1990), Baluja and Pomerleau (1995), Flake (1998), Duch et al. (1998), and Phillips and Noelle (2004). 2021 C HARIATIS 3.1 Fixed Cascaded Inhibitory Connections A problem with the hidden units of conventional feed forward networks is that they are all fed with the same inputs and back propagated errors and that they operate without knowing each other’s existence. So, nothing prevents them from behaving identically. This lack of communication between hidden units has been addressed by researchers through hidden unit lateral connections. Agyepong and Kothari (1997) use unidirectional lateral interconnections between adjacent hidden layer units, claiming that these connections facilitate the controlled assignment of role and specialization of the hidden units. Kothari and Ensley (1998) use Gaussian lateral connections which enable the hidden decision boundaries to be global in nature but also be able to represent local structure. Numerous neural network algorithms employ bidirectional lateral inhibitory connections in order to generate competition between the hidden units. In an interesting variation described by Spratling and Johnson (2004), competition is provided by each hidden unit blocking its preferred inputs from activating other units. We use a single hidden layer where the hidden units are considered sequenced. Each hidden unit is connected to all succeeding hidden units with a ﬁxed connection with weight set to minus one. The hidden units get differentiated, because they receive different inputs, they produce different activations and they get back different error information. Another beneﬁt is that they can generate higher order feature detectors, that is, the resulting hidden hyperplanes are no longer strictly linear, but they may also be curved. Considering the ﬁxed value, -1 is used just to avoid a multiplication. Values from -0.5 to -2 give good results as well. As it is shown in Section 5.1.1, the ﬁxed cascaded inhibitory connections are very effective at reducing a problem’s asymptotic residual error. This should be attributed to both of their abilities, to generate higher order feature detectors and to hasten the hidden units’ symmetry breaking. These connections can be implemented very efﬁciently with just one subtraction per hidden unit for both hidden activation and hidden error computation. In addition, the disturbance to the parallelism of the backpropagation algorithm is minimal. Most operations on the hidden units can still be done in parallel and only the ﬁnal computations must be performed sequentially. We include the algorithms for the hidden activation and error computations as examples of sequential implementations. These changes can be very easily incorporated into conventional neural network code.

We train all output units, but only the hidden units for which the error signal is higher than the RMS of the error signals of all hidden units. Typically about 10% of the hidden units are trained on each sample during early training and the percentage falls up to 2% when the network is close to the solution. This is intuitively justiﬁed by the observation that at the beginning of training the hidden units are largely undifferentiated and receive high error signals from the whole input space. At the ﬁnal stage of training, the hidden hyperplanes’ linear soft decision boundaries are combined by the output layer to deﬁne arbitrarily shaped decision boundaries. For µ input dimensions, from 1 up to µ units can deﬁne an open sub-region and µ + 1 units are enough to deﬁne a closed convex region. With such high level constructs, each sample may be discriminated from the rest with very few hidden units. These, are the units that receive the highest error signal for the sample. Experiments on various problems have shown that training on a fraction of the hidden units is always better (in respect to number of trains to convergence), than training all or just one hidden unit. It seems that training only one hidden unit on each sample is not sufﬁcient for some problems (Thornton, 1992). Measurements for one of these experiments are reported in Section 5.1.1. In addition to the convergence acceleration, the combined effect of training a fraction of the hidden units on a fraction of the samples, gives big savings in CPU usage per sample as well. This sparseness of training in respect to evaluation provides further opportunities for speedup as it is discussed in Section 4. 3.3 Centering On The Input Space It is a well known recommendation (Schraudolph, 1998a,b; LeCun et al., 1998) that the input values should be normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation over each input dimension. This is achieved by subtracting from each input value the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. For some problems, like the one in Figure 2b, the center of the input space is not equal to the center of the problem. When the input is not known in advance, the later must be computed adaptively. Moreover, since the hidden units are trained on different input samples, we should compute for each hidden unit its own mean and standard deviation over each input dimension. For the connection between hidden unit j and input unit i we can adaptively compute the approximate mean m ji and standard deviation s ji over the inputs that train the hidden unit, using either exponential traces: m ji (t) ← β xi + (1 − β) m ji (t−1) , q ji (t) ← β xi2 + (1 − β) q ji (t−1) , s ji (t) ← (q ji (t) − m ji 2 )1/2 , (t) or perturbated calculations: m ji (t) ← m ji (t−1) + β (xi − m ji (t−1) ), v ji (t) ← v ji (t−1) + β (xi − m ji (t) ) (xi − m ji (t−1) ) − v ji (t−1) , 2023 C HARIATIS 1/2 s ji (t) ← v ji (t) , where β is a constant that determines the time scale of exponential averaging, vector x holds the input values, matrix Q holds the means of the squared input values and matrix V holds the variances. The means and standard deviations of a hidden unit’s input connections are updated only when the hidden unit is trained. The result of this treatment is that each hidden unit is centered on a different part of the input space. This center is indirectly affected by the error that the inputs produce on the hidden unit. The magnitude of the constant β is problem speciﬁc, but in all experiments in this report it was kept ﬁxed to 10−3 . This constant must be selected large enough, so that the centers will rapidly move to their optimum locations, and small enough, so that the hidden units will see a relatively static view of the input space and the gradient descent algorithm will not be confused. As the hidden units jitter around their centers, we effectively train them on slightly shifted views of the input space, something that can assist generalization. We get something analogous to training with jitter (Reed et al., 1995), at no extra cost. In Figure 6, the squares show where each hidden unit is centered. You can see that most are centered on the problem boundaries at regular intervals. The crosses show the standard deviations. On some directions the standard deviations are very small, which results in very high normalized input values, causing the hidden units to act as threshold units at those directions. The sloped lines show the hyperplane distance from center and the slope. These are computed for display purposes, from their theoretical formulas for a conventional network, without considering the effect of the cascaded connections. For some units the hyperplanes shown are not exactly on the boundaries. This is because of the ﬁxed cascaded connections that cause the hidden units to be not exactly linear discriminants. In the last picture you can see the decision surface of a hidden unit which is a bit curved and coincides with the class boundary although its calculated hyperplane is not on the boundary. An observant reader may also notice that the hyperplane distances from the centers are very small, which implies that the corresponding biases are small as well. On the contrary, if all hidden units were centered on the center of the image, we would have the following problem. The hyperplanes of some hidden units must be positioned on the outer parts of the image. For this to happen, these units should develop large biases in respect to the weights. This would make their activations to have small variances. These small variances might need to be compensated by large output weights and biases, which would saturate the output units and in addition ill-condition the problems. One may wonder if the hidden biases are still necessary. Since the centers are individually set, it may seem at ﬁrst that they are not. However, the centers are not trained through error backpropagation, and the hyperplanes do not necessarily pass over them. The biases role is to drive the hyperplanes to the correct location and thus pull the centers in the corresponding direction. The individual centering of the hidden units based on the samples’ positions is feasible, because we train only on samples with high errors and only the hidden units with high errors. By ignoring the small errors, we effectively position the center of each hidden unit near the center of mass of the high errors that it receives. However, this centering technique can still be used even if one chooses to train on all samples and all hidden units. Then, the statistics interval should be differentiated for each hidden unit and be recomputed for each sample relatively to the normalized absolute error that each hidden unit receives. A way to do it is to set the effective statistics interval for hidden unit j 2024 V ERY FAST O NLINE L EARNING OF H IGHLY N ON L INEAR P ROBLEMS Figure 6: Hidden unit centers, standard deviations, hyperplanes, global and local training sets and a hidden unit’s output. The images were captured at the ﬁnal stage of training, of the problem in Figure 1a with 64 hidden units. and sample s to: β |e j,s | |e j | where β is the global statistics interval, e j,s is the hidden unit’s backpropagated error for the sample and |e j | is the mean of the absolute backpropagated errors that the hidden unit receives, measured via an exponential trace. The denominator acts as a normalizer, which makes the hidden unit’s mobility to be independent of the average magnitude of the errors. Centering on other factors has been extensively investigated by Schraudolph (1998a,b). These techniques can provide further convergence acceleration, but we chose not to use them because of the additional computational overhead that they require. 3.4 A Hybrid Activation Function As it is shown in Section 5, the aforementioned techniques enable successful training on some difﬁcult problems like those in Figures 1a and 1b. However, if the problem contains subproblems, or put in another way, if the problem generates more than one cluster of high error density, the centering mechanism does not manage to drive the hidden unit centers to the most suitable locations. The centers are attracted by the larger subproblem or get stuck in areas between the subproblems, as shown in Figure 7. 2025 C HARIATIS Figure 7: Model, training set, and inadequate centering We need a mechanism that can force a hidden unit to get out of balanced but suboptimal positions. It would be nice if this mechanism could also allow the centers to migrate to various points in the input space as the need arises. It has been found that both of these requirements are fulﬁlled by a new hybrid activation function. Sigmoid activations have the property that they produce hyperplanes that separate the input space globally. Our intention is to use a sigmoid like hidden activation function, because it can provide global separability, and at the same time, reduce the activation value towards zero on inputs which are not important to a hidden unit. The Gaussian function is commonly used within radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (Broomhead and Lowe, 1988). When this function is applied to the distance of a sample to the unit’s center, it produces a local response which is stronger near the center. We can then enclose the sigmoidal activation within a Gaussian envelope, by multiplying the activation with a value between 0 and 1, which is provided by applying the Gaussian function to the distance that is measured in the normalized input space. When the number of input dimensions is large, the distance metric that must be used is not an obvious choice. Table 1 contains the distance metrics that we have considered. The most suitable distance metric seems to depend on the distribution of the samples that train the hidden units. µ ∑ xi2 i=1 Euclidean 1 µ µ ∑ xi2 i=1 Euclidean Scaled µ ∑ |xi | i=1 Manhattan 1 µ µ ∑ |xi | i=1 Manhattan Scaled max |xi | Chebyshev Table 1: Various distance metrics that have been considered for the hybrid activation function. In particular, if the samples follow a uniform distribution over a hypercube, then the Euclidean distance has the disturbing property that the average distance grows larger as the number of input dimensions increases and consequently the corresponding average Gaussian response decreases towards zero. As suggested by Hegland and Pestov (1999), we can make the average distance to center independent of the input dimensions, by measuring it in the normalized input space and then dividing it by the square root of the input’s dimensionality. The same problem occurs for the Manhattan distance which has been claimed to be a better metric in high dimensions (Aggarwal et al., 2001). We can normalize this distance by dividing it by the input’s dimensionality. A problem that 2026 V ERY FAST O NLINE L EARNING OF H IGHLY N ON L INEAR P ROBLEMS appears for both of the above rescaled distance metrics, is that for the samples that are near the axes the distances will be very much attenuated and the corresponding Gaussian responses will be close to one, something that will make the Gaussian envelopes ineffective. A more suitable metric for this type of distributions is the Chebyshev metric whose average magnitude is independent of the dimensions. However, for reasons analogous to those mentioned above, this metric is not the most suitable if the distribution of the samples is spherical. In that case, the Euclidean distance does not need any rescaling and is the most natural distance measure. We can obtain spherical distributions by adaptively whitening them. As Plumbley (1993) and Laheld and Cardoso (1994) independently proposed, the whitening matrix Z can be adaptively computed as: Zt+1 = Zt − λ zt zt T − I Zt where λ is the learning rate parameter, zt = Zt xt is the whitened vector and xt is the input vector. However, we would need too many additional parameters to do it individually for each subset of samples on which each hidden unit is trained. For the above reasons (and because of lack of a justiﬁed alternative), in the implementation of these techniques we typically use the Euclidean metric when the number of input dimensions is up to three and the Chebyshev metric in all other cases. We have also replaced the usual tanh (sigmoidal) and Gaussian (bell-like) functions, by similar functions which do not involve exponentials (Elliott, 1993). For each hidden unit j we ﬁrst compute the net-input n j to the hidden unit (that is, the weighted distance of the sample to the hyperplane), as the inner product of normalized inputs and weights plus the bias: xi − m ji , s ji = z j · w j. z ji = nj We then compute the sample’s distance d j to the center of the unit which is measured in the normalized input space: dj = zj . Finally, we compute the activation h j as: nj , (1 + n j ) 1 , = bell(d j ) = (1 + d 2 ) j = a j b j. a j = Elliott(n j ) = bj hj Since d j is not a function of w j , we treat b j as a constant for the calculation of the activation derivative with respect to n j , which becomes: ∂h j = b j (1 − a j )2 . ∂n j 2027 C HARIATIS The hybrid activation function, which by deﬁnition may only be used for hidden units connected to the input layer, enables these units to acquire selective attention capabilities on the input space. Each hidden unit may have a global or local receptive ﬁeld on each input dimension. The size of this dimensional receptive ﬁeld depends on the standard deviation which is computed for the corresponding dimension. This activation makes balanced positions between subproblems to be unstable. As soon as the center is changed by a small amount, it will be attracted by the nearest subproblem. This is because the unit’s activation and the corresponding error will be increased for samples towards the nearest subproblem and decreased at the other direction. Hidden units can still be centered between subproblems but only if their movement at either direction causes a large error for samples at the opposite direction, that is, if they are absolutely necessary at their current position. Additionally, if a unit is centered near a subproblem that produces low errors and the unit is not necessary in that area, then it may migrate to other areas that still have high errors. This unit center migration has been observed in all experiments on complex problems. This may be due to the non-linear response of the bell function, and its long tails which keep the activation above zero for all input samples. Figure 8: Model, evaluation, training set, hidden unit centers and two hidden unit outputs showing the effect of the hybrid activation function. The images were captured at the ﬁnal stage of training, of the problem in Figure 1d with 700 hidden units. In Figure 8 you can see a complex problem with 9 clusters of high errors. The hidden units place their centers on all clusters and are able to solve the problem. In the last two images, you can see the 2028 V ERY FAST O NLINE L EARNING OF H IGHLY N ON L INEAR P ROBLEMS effect of the hybrid activation function which attenuates the activation at points far from the center in respect to the standard deviation on each dimension. One unit develops a near circular local receptive ﬁeld and one other develops an elongated ellipsoidal receptive ﬁeld. The later provides almost global separation in the vertical direction and becomes a useful discriminant for two of the subproblems. One may ﬁnd similarities between this hybrid activation function and the Square-MLP architecture described by Flake (1998). The later, partially implements higher order neurons by duplicating the number of input units and setting the new input values equal to the squares of the original inputs. This architecture enables the hidden units to form local features of various shapes, but not the locally constrained sigmoid formed by our proposal. In contrast, the hybrid activation function does not need any additional parameters beyond those that are already used for centering and it has the additional beneﬁt, which is realized by the local receptive ﬁelds in conjunction with the small biases and the symmetric sigmoid, that the hidden activations will have a mean close to zero. As discussed by Schraudolph (1998a,b) and LeCun et al. (1998), this is very beneﬁcial for the output layer training. However, there is still room for improvement. As it was also observed by Flake (1998), the orientations of the receptive ﬁeld ellipses are always at the direction of one of the input axes. This limitation is expected to hinder performance when training hidden units which have sloped hyperplanes. Figure 9 shows a complex problem at the middle of training. Units with sloped hyperplanes are trained on samples whose input values are highly correlated. This can slowdown learning by itself, but in addition, the standard deviations cannot get sufﬁciently small and as a result the receptive ﬁeld cannot be sufﬁciently shrunk at the direction perpendicular to the hyperplane. As a result the hidden unit’s activation unnecessarily interferes with the activations of nearby units. Although it may be possible to address the correlation problem with a more sophisticated training method that uses second order gradient information, like Stochastic Meta Descent (Schraudolph, 1999, 2002), the orientations of the receptive ﬁelds will still be limited. In Section 6.2 we discuss possible directions for further research that may circumvent this limitation. Figure 9: Evaluation and global and local training sets during middle training for the problem in Figure 1b. It can be seen that a hidden unit with a sloped hyperplane is trained on samples with highly correlated input values. Samples that are separated by horizontal or vertical hyperplanes are easier to be learned. 2029 C HARIATIS 4. Further Speedups In this section we ﬁrst describe an implementation technique that reduces the computational requirements of the error evaluation phase and then we give references to methods that have been proposed by other authors for the acceleration of the training phase. 4.1 Evaluation Speedup Two of the discussed techniques, training only for samples with high errors, and then, training only the hidden units with high error, make the error-evaluation phase to be the most processing demanding phase for the solution of a given problem. In addition, some other techniques, like board game learning through temporal difference methods, require many evaluations to be performed before each train. We can speedup evaluation by the following observation: For many problems, only part of the input is changed on successive samples. For example, for a backgammon program with 200 input units (with raw board data and not any additional features encoded), very few inputs will change on successive positions. Even on two dimensional problems such as images, we can arrange to train on samples selected by random changes on the X and Y dimensions alternatively. This process of only resampling one coordinate at a time is also known as “Gibbs sampling” and it nicely generalises to more than two coordinates (Geman and Geman, 1984). Thus, we can keep in memory all intermediate results from the evaluation, and recalculate only for the inputs that have changed. This implementation technique requires more storage, especially for high dimensional inputs. Fortunately, storage is not an issue on modern hardware. 4.2 Training Speedup Many authors have proposed methods for speeding-up online training by using second order gradient information in order to dynamically vary either the learning rate or the momentum (see LeCun et al., 1993; Leen and Orr, 1993; Murata et al., 1996; Harmon and Baird, 1996; Orr and Leen, 1996; Almeida et al., 1997; Amari, 1998; Schraudolph, 1998c, 1999, 2002; Graepel and Schraudolph, 2002). As it is shown in the next section, our techniques enable standard stochastic gradient descent with momentum to efﬁciently solve all the highly non-linear problems that have been investigated. However, the additional speed up that an accelerating algorithm can give is a nice thing to have. Moreover, these accelerating algorithms automatically reduce the learning rate when we are close to a solution (by sensing the oscillations in the error gradient) something that we should do through annealing if we wanted the best possible solution. We use the Incremental Delta-Delta (IDD) accelerating algorithm (Harmon and Baird, 1996), an incremental nonlinear extension to Jacobs’ (1988) Delta-Delta algorithm, because of its simplicity and relatively small processing requirements. IDD computes an individual learning rate λ for each weight w as: λ(t) = eξ(t) , ξ(t + 1) = ξ(t) + θ ∆w(t + 1) ∆w(t), λ(t) where θ is the meta-learning rate which we typically set to 0.1. 2030 V ERY FAST O NLINE L EARNING OF H IGHLY N ON L INEAR P ROBLEMS 5. Experimental Results In order to measure the effectiveness of the described techniques on various classes of problems, we performed several experiments. Each experiment was replicated 10 times with different random initial weights using matched random seeds and the means and standard deviations of the results were plotted in the corresponding ﬁgures. For the experiments we used a single hidden layer, the cross entropy error function, the logistic or softmax activation function for the output units and the Elliott or hybrid activation function for the hidden units. Output to hidden layer weights and biases were initialized to zero. Hidden to input layer weights were initialized to random numbers from a normal distribution and then rescaled so that the incoming weights to each hidden unit had norm unity. Hidden unit biases were initialized to a uniform random number between zero and one. The curves in the ﬁgures are labelled with a combination of the following letters which indicate the techniques that were applied: B – Adjust weights using stochastic gradient descent with momentum 0.9 and ﬁxed learning rate √ 0.1/ c where c is the number of incoming connections to the unit. A – Adjust weights using IDD with meta-learning rate 0.1 and initial learning rate √ 1/ c where c is as above. L – Use ﬁxed cascaded inhibitory connections as described in Section 3.1. S – Skip weights adjustment for samples with low error as described in Section 2. U – Skip weights adjustment for hidden units with low error as described in Section 3.2. C – Use individual means and stdevs for each hidden to input connection as described in Section 3.3. H – Use the hybrid activation function as described in Section 3.4. For the ‘B’ training method we deliberately avoided an annealing schedule for the learning rate, since this would destroy the initial state invariance of our techniques. Instead, we used a ﬁxed small learning rate which we compensated with a large momentum. For the ‘A’ method, we used a small meta-learning rate, to avoid instabilities due to the high non-linearities of the examined problems. It is important to note that for both training methods the learning parameters were ﬁxed to the above values and not optimized to each individual problem. For the ‘C’ technique, the centers of the hidden units where initially set to the center of the input space and the standard deviations were set to one third of the distance between the extreme values of each dimension. When the technique was not used, a global preprocessing was applied which normalized the input samples to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. 5.1 Two Input Dimensions In this section we give experimental results for the class of problems that we have mainly examined, that is, problems in two input and one output dimensions, for which we have dense and noiseless training samples from the whole input space. In the ﬁgures, we measure the average classiﬁcation error in respect to the stage of training. The classiﬁcation error was averaged via an exponential trace with time scale 10−4 . 2031 C HARIATIS 5.1.1 C OMPARISON OF T ECHNIQUE C OMBINATIONS For these experiments we used the two-spirals problem shown in Figures 1a, 3, 4 and 6. We chose this problem as a non trivial representative of the class of problems that during early training generate a single cluster of high error density. The goal of this experiment is to measure the effectiveness of various technique combinations and then to measure how well the best technique combination scales with the size of the hidden layer. Figures 10 and 11 show the average classiﬁcation error in respect to the number of evaluated samples and processing cycles respectively for 13 technique combinations. For these experiments we used 64 hidden units. The standard deviations were not plotted in order to keep the ﬁgures uncluttered. Figure 10 has also been split to Figures 12 and 13 in order to show the related error bars. Comparing the curves B vs. BL and BS vs. BLS on Figures 10 and 11, we can see that the ﬁxed cascaded inhibitory connections reduce the asymptotic residual error by more than half. This also applies, but to a lesser degree, when we skip weight updates for hidden units with low errors (B vs. BU, BS vs. BSU). When used in combination, we can see a speed-up of convergence but the asymptotic error is only marginally further improved (BLU and BLSU). In Figure 11, it can be seen that skipping samples with low errors can speed-up convergence and reduce the asymptotic error as well (BLU vs. BLSU). This is a very intriguing result, in the sense that it implies that the system can learn faster and better by throwing away information. Both Figures 10 and 11 show the BLUCH curve to diverge. Considering the success of the BLSUCH curve, we can imply that skipping samples is necessary for the hybrid activation. However, the real problem, which was found out by viewing the dynamics of training, is that the centering mechanism does not work correctly when we train on all samples. A possible remedy may be to modify the statistics interval which is used for centering, as it is described at the end of Section 3.3. BLSUC vs. BLSU shows that centering further reduces the remaining asymptotic error to half and converges much faster as well. Comparing curve BLSUCH vs. BLSUC, we see that the hybrid activation function does better, but only marginally. This was expected since this problem has a single region of interest, so the ability of H to focus on multiple regions simultaneously is not exercised. This is the reason for the additional experiments in Section 5.1.2. BLSUCH and ALSUCH were the most successful technique combinations, with the later being a little faster. Nevertheless, it is very impressive that standard stochastic gradient descent with momentum can approach the best asymptotic error in less than a second, when using a modern 3.2 GHz processor. Figure 14 shows the average classiﬁcation error in respect to the number of evaluated samples, for the ALSUCH technique combination and various hidden layer sizes. It can be seen that the asymptotic error is almost inversely proportional to the number of hidden units. This is a good indication that our techniques use the available resources efﬁciently. It is also interesting, that the convergence rates to the corresponding asymptotic errors are quite fast and about the same for all hidden layer sizes. 5.1.2 H YBRID VS .

For this kind of problems we typically obtain very small residuals for the classiﬁcation error, although the problem may not have been learned. This is because we measure the error on the whole input space and for these problems most of the input space is trivial to be learned. The problem’s complexities are conﬁned in very small areas. The dynamic training set evolution algorithm is able to locate these areas, but we need much more sample presentations, since most of the samples are not used for training. The goal of this experiment is to measure the effectiveness of the hybrid activation function at coping with the varying sizes of the subproblems. For these experiments we used 100 hidden units. Figure 15 shows that the ALSUCH technique, which employs the hybrid activation function, reduced the asymptotic error to half in respect to the ALSUC technique. As all of the visual inspections revealed, one of which is reproduced in Figure 16, the difference in the residual errors of the two curves is due to the insufﬁcient approximation of the smaller subproblem by the ALSUC technique. Model ALSUCH ALSUC Figure 16: ALSUCH vs. ALSUC approximations for a problem with two sub-problems. 5.2 Higher Input and Output Dimensions In order to evaluate our techniques on a problem with higher input and output dimensions, we selected a standard benchmark, the Letter recognition database from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Newman et al., 1998). This database consists of 20000 samples that use 16 integer attributes to classify the 26 letters of the English alphabet. This problem is characterized by a medium input dimensionality and a large output dimensionality. The later, makes it a very challenging problem for any classiﬁer. This problem differs from those on which we have experimented so far, in that we do not have the whole input space at our disposal for training. We must train on a limited number of samples and then test the system’s generalization abilities on a separate test set. Although we have not taken any special measures to assist generalization, the experimental results indicate that our techniques have the inherent ability to generalize well, when given noiseless exemplars. An observation that applies to this problem is that the IDD accelerated training method could not do better than standard stochastic gradient descent with momentum. Thus, we report results using 2036 V ERY FAST O NLINE L EARNING OF H IGHLY N ON L INEAR P ROBLEMS the BLSUCH technique combination which is computationally more efﬁcient than the ALSUCH technique. For this experiment, which involves more than two output classes, we used the softmax activation function at the output layer. Table 2 contains previously published results showing the classiﬁcation accuracy of various classiﬁers. The most successful of them were the AdaBoosted versions of the C4.5 decision-tree algorithm and of a feed forward neural network with two hidden layers. Both classiﬁer ensembles required quite a lot of machines in order to achieve that high accuracy.

Figure 17 shows the average error reduction in respect to the number of online epochs, for the BLSUCH technique combination and various hidden layer sizes. As suggested in the database’s documentation, we used the ﬁrst 16000 samples for training and for measuring the training accuracy and the rest 4000 samples to measure the predictive accuracy. The solid and dashed curves show the test and training set errors respectively. Similarly to ensemble methods, we can observe two interesting phenomena which both seem to contradict the Occam’s razor principle. The ﬁrst observation is that the test error stabilizes or continues to slightly decrease even after the training error has been zeroed. What is really happening is that the RMS error for the training set (which is related to the conﬁdence of classiﬁcation) continues to decrease even after the classiﬁcation error has been zeroed, something that is also beneﬁciary for the test set’s classiﬁcation error. The second observation is that increasing the network’s capacity does not lead to over ﬁtting. Although the training set error can be zeroed with just 125 hidden units, increasing the number of hidden units reduces the residual test error as well. We attribute this phenomenon to the conjecture that the hidden units’ differentiation results in a smoother approximation (as suggested by Figure 5 and the related discussion). Comparing our results with those in Table 2, we can also observe the following: The 16-125-26 MLP (5401 weights) reached a 4.6% misclassiﬁcation error on average, which is 26% better than the 6.2% of the 16-70-50-26 MLP (6066 weights), despite the fact that it had fewer weights, a simpler 2037 C HARIATIS 125 T RAIN 125 T EST 250 T RAIN 250 T EST 500 T RAIN 500 T EST 1000 T RAIN TEST ERROR % UNITS MIN AVG at end 125 4.0 4.6 250 2.8 3.2 500 2.3 2.6 1000 2.1 2.4 0,10 1000 T EST 0,05 0,00 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Figure 17: Average error reduction vs. number of online epochs for various hidden layer sizes, while training on the UCI Letters Recognition Database with the BLSUCH technique combination.

It is indicative that the asymptotic residual classiﬁcation error on the test set was reached in about 30 online epochs. The 16-1000-26 MLP (43026 weights) reached a 2.4% misclassiﬁcation error on average, which is the third best published result following the AdaBoosted 16-70-50-26 MLPs with 20 and 100 machines (121320 and 606600 weights respectively). The lowest observed classiﬁcation error was 2.1% and was reached in one of the 10 runs at the 80th epoch. It must be stressed that the above results were obtained without any optimization of the learning rate, without a learning rate annealing schedule and within a by far shorter training time. All MLPs with 250 hidden units and above, gave results which put them at the top of the list of non-ensemble techniques and they even outperformed Adaboost on C4.5 with 100 machines. Similarly to Figure 14, we also see that the convergence rates to the corresponding asymptotic errors on the test set are quite fast and about the same for all hidden layer sizes. 6. Discussion and Future Research We have presented global and local selective attention techniques that can help neural network training to concentrate on the difﬁcult parts of complex non-linear problems. A new hybrid activation function has also been presented that enables the hidden units to acquire individual receptive ﬁelds 2038 V ERY FAST O NLINE L EARNING OF H IGHLY N ON L INEAR P ROBLEMS in the input space. These individual receptive ﬁelds may be global or local depending on the problem’s local complexities. The success of the new activation function is due to the fact that it depends on two distances. The ﬁrst is the weighted distance of a sample to the hidden unit’s hyperplane. The second is the distance to the hidden unit’s center. We need both distances and neither of them is sufﬁcient. The ﬁrst helps us discriminate and the second helps us localize. The dynamic training set evolution algorithm locates the sub-areas of the input space where the problem resides. The ﬁxed cascaded inhibitory connections and the selective training of a subset of the hidden units on each sample, force the hidden units to get differentiated and attack different subproblems. The individual centering of the hidden units at different points in the input space, adaptively conditions the network to the problem’s local structures and enables each hidden unit to solve a well-conditioned subproblem. In coordination with the above, the hidden units’ limited receptive ﬁelds allow training to follow a divide and conquer paradigm where each hidden unit only solves a local subproblem. The solutions to the subproblems are then combined by the output layer to give a solution to the original problem. In the reported experiments we initialized the hidden weights and biases so that the hidden hyperplanes would cover the whole input space at random positions and orientations. The initial norm of the weights was also adjusted so that the net-input to each hidden unit would fall in the transition between the linear and non-linear range of the activation function. These speciﬁc initializations were necessary for standard backpropagation. On the contrary, we have found that the combined techniques are insensitive to the initial weights and biases, as long as their values are small. We have repeated the experiments with hidden biases set to zero and hidden weight norms set to 10 −3 and the results where equivalent to those reported in Section 5. However, the choice of the best initial learning rate is still problem speciﬁc. An additional and important characteristic of these techniques is that training of the hidden layer does not depend solely on gradient information. Gradient based techniques can only perform local optimization by locating a local minimum of the error function when the system is already at the basin of attraction of that minimum. Stochastic training has a potential of escaping from a shallow basin, but only when the basin is not very wide. Once there, the system cannot escape towards a different basin with a lower minimum. On the contrary, in our model some of the hidden layer’s free parameters (the weights) are trained through gradient descent on the error, whereas some other (the means and standard deviations) are “trained” from the statistical properties of the back-propagated errors. Each hidden unit places its center near the center of mass of the error that it receives and limits its visibility only to the area of the input space where it produces a signiﬁcant error. This model makes the hidden error landscape to constantly change. We conjecture that during training, paths connecting the various error basins are continuously emerging and vanishing. As a result the system can explore much more of the solution space. It is indicative that in all the reported experiments, all trials converged to a solution with more or less the same residual error irrespectively of the initial network state. The combination of the presented techniques enables very fast training on complex classiﬁcation problems with embedded subproblems. By focusing on the problem’s details and efﬁciently utilizing the available resources, they make feasible the solution of very difﬁcult problems (like the one in Figure 1e), provided that the adequate number of hidden units has been used. Although other machine learning techniques can do the same, to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst report that this can be done using ordinary feed forward neural networks and backpropagation, in an online, adaptive 2039 C HARIATIS and memory-less scenario, where the input exemplars are unknown before training and discarded after being used. In the following we discuss some areas that deserve further investigation. 6.1 Generalization and Regression For the classes of problems that were investigated, we had noiseless exemplars and the whole input space at our disposal for training, so there was no danger of overﬁtting. Thus, we did not use any mechanism to assist generalization. This does not mean of course that the network just stored the input output mapping, as a lookup table would do. By putting constraints on the positions and orientations of the hidden unit hyperplanes and by limiting their receptive ﬁelds, we reduced the system’s available degrees of freedom, and the network arranged its resources in a way to achieve the best possible input-output mapping approximation. The experiments on the Letter Recognition Database showed remarkable generalization capabilities. However, when we train on noisy samples or when the number of training samples is small in respect to the size and complexity of the input space, we have the danger of overﬁtting. It remains to be examined how the described techniques are affected by methods that avoid overﬁtting, such as, training with jitter, error regularization, target smoothing and sigmoid gain attenuation (Reed et al., 1995). This consideration also applies to regression problems which usually require smoother approximations. Although early experiments give evidence that the presented techniques can be applied to regression problems as well, we feel that some smoothing technique must be included in the training framework. 6.2 Receptive Fields Limited Orientations As it was noted in Section 3.4, the orientations of the receptive ﬁeld ellipses are limited to have the direction of one of the input axes. This hinders training performance by not allowing the receptive ﬁelds to be adequately shrunk at the direction perpendicular to the hyperplane. In addition, hidden units with sloped hyperplanes are trained on highly correlated input values. These problems are expected to be exaggerated in high dimensional input spaces. We would cure both of these problems simultaneously, if we could individually transform the input for each hidden unit through adaptive whitening, or, if we could present to each hidden unit a rotated view of the input space, such that, one of the axes to be perpendicular to the hyperplane and the rest to be parallel to the hyperplane. Unfortunately, both of the above transformations would require too many additional parameters. An approximation (for 2 dimensional problems) that we are currently investigating upon is the following: For each input vector we compute K vectors rotated around the center of the input space with successive angle increments equal to π/(2K). Our purpose is to obtain uniform rotations between 0 and π/4. Every a few hundred training steps, we reassign to each hidden unit the most appropriate input representation and adjust the affected parameters (weights, means and stdevs). The results are promising. 6.3 Dynamic Cascaded Inhibitory Connections Regarding the ﬁxed cascaded inhibitory connections, it must be examined whether it is better to make the strength of the connections, dynamic. Minus one is OK when the weights are small. How2040 V ERY FAST O NLINE L EARNING OF H IGHLY N ON L INEAR P ROBLEMS ever as the weights get larger, the inhibitory connections get less and less effective to differentiate the hidden units. We can try to make them relative to each hidden unit’s average absolute net-input or alternatively to make them trainable. It has been observed that increasing the strength of these connections enables the hidden units to generate more curved discriminant functions, which is very beneﬁciary for some problems. 6.4 Miscellaneous More experiments need to be done, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid activation function on highly non-linear problems in many dimensions. High dimensional input spaces have a multitude of disturbing properties in regard to distance and density metrics, which may affect the hybrid activation in yet unknown ways. Last, we must devise a training mechanism, that will be invariant to the initial learning rate and that will vary automatically the number of hidden units as each problem requires.

<p>Author: Kristen Grauman, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: In numerous domains it is useful to represent a single example by the set of the local features or parts that comprise it. However, this representation poses a challenge to many conventional machine learning techniques, since sets may vary in cardinality and elements lack a meaningful ordering. Kernel methods can learn complex functions, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences—generally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function called the pyramid match that measures partial match similarity in time linear in the number of features. The pyramid match maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in order to ﬁnd implicit correspondences based on the ﬁnest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair ﬁrst appears. We show the pyramid match yields a Mercer kernel, and we prove bounds on its error relative to the optimal partial matching cost. We demonstrate our algorithm on both classiﬁcation and regression tasks, including object recognition, 3-D human pose inference, and time of publication estimation for documents, and we show that the proposed method is accurate and signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than current approaches.

<p>Author: Margarita Osadchy, Yann Le Cun, Matthew L. Miller</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel method for simultaneously detecting faces and estimating their pose in real time. The method employs a convolutional network to map images of faces to points on a lowdimensional manifold parametrized by pose, and images of non-faces to points far away from that manifold. Given an image, detecting a face and estimating its pose is viewed as minimizing an energy function with respect to the face/non-face binary variable and the continuous pose parameters. The system is trained to minimize a loss function that drives correct combinations of labels and pose to be associated with lower energy values than incorrect ones. The system is designed to handle very large range of poses without retraining. The performance of the system was tested on three standard data sets—for frontal views, rotated faces, and proﬁles— is comparable to previous systems that are designed to handle a single one of these data sets. We show that a system trained simuiltaneously for detection and pose estimation is more accurate on both tasks than similar systems trained for each task separately.1 Keywords: face detection, pose estimation, convolutional networks, energy based models, object recognition</p><p>2 0.67383236 <a title="80-lda-2" href="./jmlr-2007-The_Pyramid_Match_Kernel%3A_Efficient_Learning_with_Sets_of_Features.html">84 jmlr-2007-The Pyramid Match Kernel: Efficient Learning with Sets of Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Chao-Chun Liu, Dao-Qing Dai, Hong Yan</p><p>Abstract: Face recognition is a challenging problem due to variations in pose, illumination, and expression. Techniques that can provide effective feature representation with enhanced discriminability are crucial. Wavelets have played an important role in image processing for its ability to capture localized spatial-frequency information of images. In this paper, we propose a novel local discriminant coordinates method based on wavelet packet for face recognition to compensate for these variations. Traditional wavelet-based methods for face recognition select or operate on the most discriminant subband, and neglect the scattered characteristic of discriminant features. The proposed method selects the most discriminant coordinates uniformly from all spatial frequency subbands to overcome the deﬁciency of traditional wavelet-based methods. To measure the discriminability of coordinates, a new dilation invariant entropy and a maximum a posterior logistic model are put forward. Moreover, a new triangle square ratio criterion is used to improve classiﬁcation using the Euclidean distance and the cosine criterion. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust for face recognition under variations in illumination, pose and expression.

<p>Author: Ofer Melnik, Yehuda Vardi, Cun-Hui Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Rankboost has been shown to be an effective algorithm for combining ranks. However, its ability to generalize well and not overﬁt is directly related to the choice of weak learner, in the sense that regularization of the rank function is due to the regularization properties of its weak learners. We present a regularization property called consistency in preference and conﬁdence that mathematically translates into monotonic concavity, and describe a new weak ranking learner (MWGR) that generates ranking functions with this property. In experiments combining ranks from multiple face recognition algorithms and an experiment combining text information retrieval systems, rank functions using MWGR proved superior to binary weak learners. Keywords: rankboost, ranking, convex/concave, regularization 1. Ranking Problems A ranking problem is a learning problem that involves ranks as the inputs, the outputs or both. An example where ranks are used as inputs is a collaborative ﬁltering application where people are asked to rank movies according to their preferences. In such an application the ranks assigned by different people are combined to generate recommendations. Another type of problem in which ranks are used as inputs are meta-search problems, where the ranks of multiple search engines are combined (Dwork et al., 2001). However, the inputs to a ranking problem are not always ranks. An object recognition ranking problem (Kittler and Roli, 2000) may receive as inputs a graphical representation and output a ranking of the possible objects, sorted by likelihood. The outputs of a ranking problem may also be ranks. For example, in combining multiple search engines the output are ranks which are a synthesis of the ranks from the individual search engines. A similar meta-recognition problem is the combination of the outputs of multiple face- recognition systems to improve the accuracy of detecting the correct face. While the inputs and outputs of this problem are ranks, the outputs can be simpliﬁed to only return the most likely candidate. Another example where the outputs do not need to be complete ranks could be an information retrieval combination task. In such a task the inputs might be ranks of sets of documents with respect to c 2007 Ofer Melnik, Yehuda Vardi and Cun-Hui Zhang. M ELNIK , VARDI AND Z HANG a particular query by different experts. Again, the outputs could be the complete ranks, or more simply a designation for each document of whether it is relevant or not to the particular query. 2. Rankboost The rankboost algorithm (Freund et al., 2003) tries to address this variety in ranking problems by maintaining generality in how it regards its inputs and how it applies different loss functions to outputs. The rankboost algorithm works on instances which are the discrete items (e.g., movies or faces) that either are ranked as input or are to be ranked as output. To allow a general input mechanism, the inputs to rankboost are called the ranking features of an instance, speciﬁed as f j (x) which is the j-th ranking feature of instance x. While this generality in how inputs are handled is potentially powerful, in the original rankboost paper as well as in this paper, only the case where the inputs are different rankings of the instances is considered. Thus, in this paper, the inputs to rankboost are constituent ranks, denoted as f 1 . . . fn , where f j (x ) < f j (x ) implies that instance x has a better rank than instance x under ranking f j . For example, in some of the experiments we present, each f j is the ranking result of a particular face recognition algorithm. The output of rankboost is a new ranking function, H(x), which deﬁnes a linear ordering on the instances, that is, H (x ) < H (x ) iff x has a better rank than x . In rankboost T H(x) = ∑ wt ht (x), (1) t=1 a weighted sum of weak ranking learners, where the ht (x)’s are relatively simple learned functions of the constituent rankings. To address the variety in possible loss functions of the outputs, in rankboost the desirable properties for the output loss function are speciﬁed with a favor function, Φ : X × X → R, where X is the space of instances (note that this function has been renamed from “preference function” to avoid confusion with the use of preference in this paper in Section 4). Here Φ (x , x ) > 0 means that x should be better ranked than x for a given query. It is an anti-symmetric function, that is, Φ (x , x ) = −Φ (x , x ) and Φ (x, x) = 0, which avoids loops where two instances should both be ranked better than the other. Also Φ (x , x ) = 0 when there is no favor in how two instances should be relatively ranked. For example, as described in Section 6.1, for the face recognition combination problem described above the favor function can be used to specify that the correct identity should be given a better rank than all other identities, while zeroing all other entries in the favor function, giving no favor in how incorrect identities are ranked between them. In a similar fashion for the information retrieval combination task mentioned above, the favor function can be speciﬁed such that all relevant documents should be better ranked than irrelevant documents, without specifying favor for the ordering between relevant documents and the ordering between irrelevant documents (Section 7.1). Rankboost is shown in Algorithm 1 as described in Freund et al. (2003). It uses the favor function to specify an initial weight function over instance pair orderings: D x ,x = c · max 0, Φ x , x −1 , (2) where c = ∑x ,x max (0, Φ (x , x )) . The algorithm itself is very similar to adaboost (Freund and Schapire, 1996). At each iteration the algorithm selects the weak learner that best maximizes a 792 C ONCAVE L EARNERS FOR R ANKBOOST Algorithm 1 rankboost algorithm for generating a ranking function. Input: constituent ranks, a favor function, and a class of weak learners with outputs between 0 and 1 and an appropriate training algorithm. Output: ranking function H(x) (Eq. 1) Initialize D(1) = D (Eq. 2) for t = 1 . . . T do Find weak learner, ht , that maximizes r(h) = ∑x ,x D(t) (x , x )(h(x ) − h(x )) (Eq. 4). Choose wt = 0.5 ln ((1 + r(ht )) / (1 − r(ht ))) . (Eq. 5) Update: D(t+1) (x , x ) = D(t) (x , x ) exp (wt (ht (x ) − ht (x ))) Zt where Zt is chosen to make ∑x ,x D(t+1) (x , x ) = 1 end for rank function’s utility, r(h), (Eq. 4). It then assigns it a weight in proportion to its performance and adds the weighted weak learner to the ranking function, H(x). After which the weight function D is adjusted to reﬂect the impact of the weak learner. Freund et al. (2003) prove that the rankboost algorithm iteratively minimizes the ranking loss function, a measure of the quantity of misranked pairs: ∑ D x ,x I H x ≤ H x x ,x where I is the indicator function (1 if true, 0 otherwise) and H(x) is a ranking function output by rankboost. The rankboost paper (Freund et al., 2003) uses binary weak learners of the following functional form:  i f f j (x) > θ,  1 0 i f f j (x) ≤ θ, (3) h(x) =  qde f i f f j (x) unde f ined. Each binary weak learner, h, operates on a single f j (ranking feature), giving a binary output of 0 or 1 depending on whether the instance’s rank is smaller than a learned parameter, θ. Note that function h(x) in (3), which is dependent on only one f j (x) with a ﬁxed j, is monotonic increasing but not convex or concave. If there is no rank for the instance then it returns a prespeciﬁed q de f value. 3. Rankboost, the Weak Learner and Regularization While rankboost inherits the accuracy of adaboost and has been shown to be very successful in practice, in two important ways it is very different from adaboost and similar classiﬁer leveraging algorithms (Meir and Ratsch, 2003). The ﬁrst is the choice of the weak learner, h. In adaboost the weak learner is expected to minimize the weighted empirical classiﬁcation error: N ∑ d (t) (i)I [yi = h (zi )] , i=1 where yi is the class label, I is the indicator function and d (t) is a weighting over training samples. This is a standard function to minimize in classiﬁcation with many possible types of algorithms to 793 M ELNIK , VARDI AND Z HANG choose from as possible weak learners. In contrast the weak ranking learner for rankboost (with outputs in [0, 1]) needs to maximize the following rank utility function: r = r(h) = ∑ D(t) (x , x )(h(x ) − h(x )), (4) x ,x where D(t) is the weight function over pairs of instances. As Eq. 4 contains the term h(x ) − h(x ), short of linear learners this equation can not be concave in h or easily approximated by a concave function. Therefore the weak learner needs to be optimized either by heuristics or by brute force, which limits the choice of h. It is not surprising that the original rankboost paper only included one type of weak learner, a binary threshold function (Eq. 3) that was tuned using brute force. The second difference between rankboost and adaboost also concerns the weak ranking learner. One feature of boosting that has sparked a great deal of interesting research is the algorithm’s ability to avoid overﬁtting for low noise classiﬁcation problems (with modiﬁcations to higher noise problems), see Meir and Ratsch (2003) for a survey. In contrast for rankboost it is only by limiting the type of underlying weak learners that overﬁtting is avoided. In their paper, Freund et al. (2003) show that not using weak ranking learners with cumulative positive coefﬁcients leads to overﬁtting and poor performance quite quickly. Therefore, choosing a weak learner that regularizes the ranking function, the output of rankboost, is very important for achieving accuracy and avoiding overﬁtting. It is clear from the above discussion that the choice of a weak ranking learner for rankboost is important and non trivial. First, the learner must be efﬁciently tunable with respect to Eq. 4, typically limiting its complexity. Second, the learner itself must demonstrate regularization properties that are appropriate for ranking functions. In this paper we present a new weak ranking learner that enforces consistency in preference and conﬁdence for the ranking function by being monotonic and concave. We start with a discussion of these regularization properties, theoretically justify them, and show what they mean in terms of the ﬁnal ranking function. Then we present a new learner, Minimum Weighted Group Ranks (MWGR), that satisﬁes these properties and can be readily learned. This learner is tested and compared with the binary learner of rankboost on combining multiple face recognition systems from the FERET study (Phillips et al., 2000) and on an information retrieval combination task from TREC (Voorhees and Harman, 2001). 4. Regularizing Ranking Functions with Consistency in Preference and Conﬁdence In this paper, as Freund et al. (2003), we consider ranking functions H(x) which depend on x only through the values of the ranking features, y j = f j (x), for that instance, so that H(x) = G ( f1 (x), . . . , fn (x)), for certain functions G (y1 , . . . , yn ) = G(y). Here, we assume that the f j (x) is an actual rank assigned to an instance, x, by the j-th ranker. Note that if the original data are numerical scores then they can easily be converted to rankings. Freund et al. (2003) make a strong case for conversion of raw measures to relative orderings (rankings) over combining measures directly, arguing that it is more general and avoids the semantics of particular measures. As the y j ’s are ranks instead of points in a general space, care should be taken as to the functional form of G. A great deal of literature in social choice theory (Arrow, 1951) revolves around the properties of various rank combination strategies that try to achieve fair rankings. In this machine learning case our motivations are different. Fairness is not the goal; the goal is to improve the 794 C ONCAVE L EARNERS FOR R ANKBOOST accuracy or performance of the ranking function. Thus, regularization, by functionally constraining G, is used to confer information on how to interpret ranks in order to ultimately improve accuracy. Freund et al. (2003) imposed the regularization principle of monotonicity on the ranking function. Monotonicity encompasses a belief that for individual features a smaller rank is always considered better than a bigger rank. It means that for every two rank vectors, a and b, if a j ≤ b j , j = 1, . . . , n then G(a) ≤ G(b). Monotonicity was enforced by requiring that the coefﬁcients, wt in Eq. 1, combining the binary weak learners (Eq. 3) were cumulatively positive. As shown by Freund et al. (2003), without enforcing monotonicity the rankboost algorithm quickly overﬁts. In this section we present another regularization principle, consistency in preference and conﬁdence (which includes monotonicity). A ranking function with this regularization property should be consistent in its preference for the individual rankers and also in how it captures their conﬁdence. The following example illustrates these two concepts. 4.1 Grocer Example A grocer needs to make 2 decisions, to decide between stocking oat bran vs. granola and to decide between stocking turnips vs. radishes. The grocer asks her consultants to express their opinion about stocking each item, and based on their responses makes her 2 decisions. First of all, in either problem, the grocer will adopt the opinion of her consultants if they all agree with each other, that is, they all prefer granola over oat bran in the ﬁrst problem. Lets assume the grocer considered the ﬁrst problem and chose granola over oat bran. What this implies is that the grocer adopted the opinions of the consultants that preferred granola over oat bran. Now consider the turnips vs. radishes decision. Lets say that the same consultants that liked granola more also liked radishes more (and the same ones that like oat bran more like turnips more). Also, for this decision the radish lovers actually feel more conﬁdent in their choice than they did for granola, while the turnip lovers are more unsure than they were for oat bran. Then for this second choice, if the grocer is consistent in her method of combining the opinions of her consultants, we would expect her to pick radishes over the turnips. In addition, we would expect her to be more conﬁdent in this second decision as a reﬂection of the consultants relative conﬁdence. The above properties of preference and conﬁdence imply that preference should be applied consistently across different problems and conﬁdence should reﬂect the relative conﬁdences of the individual consultants. 4.2 The General Principle of Consistency in Preference and Conﬁdence To generalize the above grocer’s problem consider the problem of combining the opinions of a panel of consultants on several multiple-choice decision problems. Suppose for each decision problem each consultant provides his preference as one of the possible choices and a qualitative measure of the conﬁdence level for his preference. The consistency principle in preference and conﬁdence holds if the combiner always agrees with at least one of the consultants in each decision problem and that the following condition holds for any pair of decision problems. Deﬁnition 1. Consistency principle for a pair of decision problems: Suppose that for the ﬁrst decision problem, the combiner adopts the preference of a subset A of consultants in the sense that A is the (non empty) set of all consultants whose preference is identical to that of the combiner. 795 M ELNIK , VARDI AND Z HANG Suppose that for the second decision problem, the preference of the consultants in A is again identical. Suppose further that compared with the conﬁdence level for the ﬁrst decision problem, each consultant in A has higher or the same conﬁdence level for his preference in the second problem, while each consultant with a different preference than A for the second problem has lower or the same conﬁdence level. Then, the preference of the combiner for the second problem is identical to that of the consultants in A, and the conﬁdence level of the combiner for the second problem is at least as high as his conﬁdence level for the ﬁrst problem. Let B be the set of consultants whose preferences are different from that of the combiner in the ﬁrst decision problem, that is, B = Ac . If some members of B switch sides or have no preference in the second problem, the combiner would be even more conﬁdent about the adoption of the preference of A in the second problem regardless of the conﬁdence of those who switch sides. Thus, Deﬁnition 1 requires only those against the preference of A in the second problem (necessarily a subset of B since members of A act in unison in both problems) to have lower or equal conﬁdence in the second problem, instead of all members of B. This is taken into consideration in Theorem 1 below. Note that while preference for individual consultants is speciﬁed within each decision problem, two decision problems are needed to compare the qualitative measure of conﬁdence. However, comparison of conﬁdence is not always possible (it is a partial ordering). In particular, the level of conﬁdence between different experts may not be comparable, and the levels of conﬁdence of a given expert (or the combiner) for different decision problems are not always comparable. 4.3 Conﬁdence for Ranks and Ranking Functions In order to apply consistency to rank combination we need to specify what we mean by more or less conﬁdence. For ranks we make the assumption that a constant change of ranks requires more conﬁdence for low ranks than high ranks. For example, we would expect the difference between ranks of 1 and 3 to represent a more signiﬁcant distinction on the part of a ranker than would for example the difference between ranks 34 and 36 which may be almost arbitrarily assigned. Speciﬁcally we make the following deﬁnition: Deﬁnition 2. Preference and conﬁdence for univariate rank values For any pair of rank values {r, r } ⊂ R with r < r , by monotonicity r is preferred. For any two pairs of rank values {r, r } and {r , r } with r < r and r ≤ r , the conﬁdence level for {r, r }is higher than that of {r , r } if r ≤ r , r −r ≤ r −r with at least one inequality. The pair{r, r }provides no preference if r = r . Likewise, if either r − r = r − r = 0 or r − r = r − r = 0, the two pairs {r, r } and {r , r }are deﬁned to have the same level of conﬁdence. In this deﬁnition conﬁdence between pairs of ranks can only be compared if the pair with the lowest rank has a gap at least as large as the other pair. Thus, we are actually comparing two numbers, that is, we are doing a vector comparison. As such, this comparison does not cover all pairs of ranks and applies only a partial ordering on rank pairs. As a regularization principle, a partial ordering is desirable since it does not overly constrain the ranking function and allows for ﬂexibility. 796 C ONCAVE L EARNERS FOR R ANKBOOST As the rank function, G, is a univariate function, we apply the same deﬁnitions of preference and conﬁdence to it. That is, for a ranking function G and for any ﬁxed rank vectors, y and y , the preferred rank vector is the one with smaller G, that is, y is preferred iff G(y) < G(y ). For conﬁdence again we need to consider pairs of rank vectors, {y, y } and {y , y }, with G(y) ≤ G(y ) and G(y ) ≤ G(y ). If G(y) ≤ G(y ) and G(y ) − G(y) ≥ G(y ) − G(y ) then we say that the ﬁrst decision, between yand y , shows equal or more conﬁdence than the second decision between y and y . This numerical method of capturing conﬁdence and preference in ranks, y, and ranking functions, G, allows us to apply Deﬁnition 1. Speciﬁcally, for a pair of binary decisions the conﬁdence of a consistent ranking function increases for the second decision if in the second decision the conﬁdence of the agreeing rank values are comparable and increase and the conﬁdence of the disagreeing rank values are comparable and decrease, with the exception of those that switched sides. 4.4 Three-Point Consistency in Preference and Conﬁdence for Combining Ranks As described, the consistency property is over two binary decision problems. In this section we consider ranking functions, G, that have consistency in preference and conﬁdence for all pairs of binary decision problems involving three rank vectors y, y and y . We show that such functions have speciﬁc mathematical properties under this three-point consistency principle in preference and conﬁdence for ranks.. Theorem 1: For a ranking function G whose domain is convex, three-point consistency in preference and conﬁdence holds for G iff G(y) is nondecreasing in individual components of y and is jointly concave in y. Proof of Necessity: Assume that the ranking function G exhibits three-point consistency in preference and conﬁdence for any three rank vectors. If y ≤ y component wise, then the individual components of y all agree in their preference to y, so that G(y) ≤ G(y ) by the consistency of G in preference. This implies the monotonicity of G in y. We pick three points y, y − a and y + a, such that all points are rank vectors. Consider the pair of binary comparison problems, y vs. y + a and y − a vs. y. Assume that G(y) < G(y + a). These three points are comparable by Deﬁnition 2 (r − r = r − r for all components in the rank vectors). Since the agreeing rankers, A = j y j < y j + a j , in the y vs. y + a comparison are greater than in the y − a vs. y comparison, and the disagreeing ranks, outside A, are smaller, then by the consistency of the combiner in preference and conﬁdence (deﬁnition 1), G(y − a) ≤ G(y) and G(y) − G(y − a) ≥ G(y + a) − G(y). A function G is concave in a convex domain iff 2G(y) ≥ G(y − a) + G(y + a), for every y and a with y ± a in its domain. To verify this inequality for a particular y and a, we must have G(y + a) > G(y), G(y − a) > G(y) or the third case of G(y) ≥ max{G(y + a), G(y − a)}. We have already proven that the consistency properties of preference and conﬁdence imply G(y) − G(y − a) ≥ G(y + a) − G(y) in the ﬁrst case. By symmetry this requirement also must hold for −a, so that G(y) − G(y + a) ≥ G(y − a) − G(y) in the second case. This completes the necessity part of the proof since 2G(y) ≥ G(y − a) + G(y + a) automatically holds in the third case. Proof of Sufﬁciency: Assume the ranking function G is nondecreasing in individual components of y and jointly concave in y. We need to prove consistency in preference and conﬁdence for a pair 797 M ELNIK , VARDI AND Z HANG 1) G(y) < G(y’) y ≤ y’’ A A y’’ A 4 A A 10 y’ 8 y’ 6 4) G(y) > G(y’) y ≥ y’’ A 10 8 A 2) G(y) < G(y’) y ≥ y’’ A 10 8 6 y A y 6 4 4 2 2 2 0 0 y y’ y’’ y’’ 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 B 6 8 10 0 0 B 2 4 6 8 10 B Figure 1: Consider two decision problems in two dimensions involving three points, y, y and y , where the ﬁrst decision problem is to choose between y and y and the second problem is to choose between y and y . The cases where we expect consistency in preference and conﬁdence (Deﬁnitions 1 and 2) can be enumerated by the result of the ﬁrst decision problem and relative location of y . The darker gray box is the location where B has lesser or equal conﬁdence in the second problem, and the lighter gray box is where B switches sides. of decision problems involving three rank vectors y, y and y . Without loss of generality, suppose that the ﬁrst problem is to choose between y and y and the second problem is to choose between y and y . We break the proof up by the results of the comparison between y vs. y and the relative location of the third ranking vector y that satisﬁes the preference and conﬁdence requirements. If G(y) = G(y ) = G(y ), the combiner has equal conﬁdence in the two decision problems by deﬁnition 2, so that the consistency principle holds automatically. Thus, we only need to consider the cases where G(y) = G(y ). Figure 1 illustrates three of these cases two dimensionally, where there is a single agreeing component A, the y-axis, and a single disagreeing component B, the x-axis. Let A be the set of agreeing indices, A = j : sgn(y j − y j ) = sgn (G(y ) − G(y)) = 0 , and B = c the set of disagreeing indices. We use the notation y = (y , j ∈ A) to describe corresponding A j A subvectors. Also, when used, vector inequalities are component wise. Case 1: G(y) < G(y ) and yA ≤ yA In the ﬁrst decision problem, as G agrees with A and disagrees with B yA < y A , yB ≥ y B . / We also know that A = 0 since otherwise y ≥ y and therefore by monotonicity G(y) ≥ G(y ), which is a contradiction. For the second decision problem we consider the values of y which are consistent with the conﬁdence assumption (Deﬁnitions 1 and 2), that is, agreeing with more conﬁdence along the A indices and disagreeing with less conﬁdence or switching sides along the B indices. As y A ≤ yA , either by the conﬁdence relationship or by switching sides (see Figure 1) these y values satisfy yA − y A ≥ y A − y A , 798 yB − y B ≤ y B − y B C ONCAVE L EARNERS FOR R ANKBOOST which implies y ≤ y , and therefore G(y ) ≤ G(y ) by monotonicity. Thus, G(y) < G(y ) ≤ G(y ), which implies that in the second decision problem of choosing between y and y , the preference of G is the same as that of A (i.e., y since yA ≤ yA ) and the conﬁdence of G is at least as high as the ﬁrst decision problem. Case 2: G(y) < G(y ) and yA ≥ yA Since in this case yA ≥ yA , then either by the conﬁdence relationship or by switching sides y satisﬁes yA − y A ≥ y A − y A , yB − y B ≤ y B − y B . This implies that y + y ≤ 2y, which means that G(y ) + G(y ) ≤ 2G y +y /2 ≤ 2G(y) by the concavity and monotonicity of G. Thus, G(y) − G(y ) ≥ G(y ) − G(y) and since G(y ) > G(y), we have that G(y) − G(y ) > 0 and thus G(y) > G(y ). Therefore we see that the preference in G for the two decision problems is the same as A (with y in the ﬁrst problem and with y in the second problem) and the conﬁdence is no smaller for the second comparison. Case 3: G(y) > G(y ) and yA ≤ yA Since y is preferred in the ﬁrst decision problem we have yA > y A , yB ≤ y B . For the conﬁdence assumption to hold, that is, greater conﬁdence for A in the second problem (Deﬁnition 2), the smaller ranks in the second problem have to be smaller than the smaller ranks in the ﬁrst problem. But with yA ≥ yA and yA ≤ yA that can only be if yA = yA , which leads to y ≤ y , and by monotonicity implies G(y) ≤ G(y ). However that is a contradiction to G(y) > G(y ), and therefore this is not a viable case for comparing conﬁdence. Case 4: G(y) > G(y ) and yA ≥ yA Since in this case yA ≥ yA , then either by the conﬁdence relationship or by switching sides y satisﬁes yA − y A ≥ y A − y A , yB − y B ≤ y B − y B , which means that y ≤ y . Thus, by the monotonicity of G, G(y ) ≤ G(y ). Since G(y ) < G(y) the preference in the second decision problem is also with A (i.e., y ) and the conﬁdence is at least as high as the ﬁrst decision problem. 4.5 Applying Regularization to Rankboost It follows from the above theorem that to have consistency in preference and conﬁdence we desire ranking functions that are monotonic and concave. In rankboost H(x) = ∑ wt ht (x) (Eq. 1). To make H an increasing and concave function of constituent rankings y j = f j (x) we need to constrain the weak ranking learners. If the learners themselves are monotonically increasing and concave functions of y j , then linearly combining them with positive weights will give an H that is also an increasing and concave function of y j . 799 M ELNIK , VARDI AND Z HANG In this paper, we apply the “third method” (Freund et al., 2003) to setting a wt weight value. That is, weak learners are selected on their ability to maximize r from Eq. 4 and then wt = 0.5 ln ((1 + rmax ) / (1 − rmax )) . (5) Therefore, using monotonic and concave weak learners we select only ones that rankboost gives a positive r value to, which renders a positive wt weight. If no r values are positive the rankboost algorithm stops. We mention that a ranking function can be construed as the negative of a score function, that is, G(y) = −S(y). For score functions these regularization properties become monotonically decreasing, and convex (Melnik et al., 2004). 5. Minimum Weighted Group Ranks The functional structure of the new learner we propose is h(y) = min {γ1 y1 , . . . , γn yn , 1} , (6) where y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) = ( f1 (x), . . . , fn (x)) the vector of ranking features, and the γ j are learned positive coefﬁcients. Note that the function’s range is in [0, 1] due to the 1 term in the min function. Using rankings as our features, the learner function (Eq. 6) is monotonically increasing. It is also a concave function in y. Thus if these learners are linearly combined with positive weights, the resulting ranking function, H, will have three-point consistency in conﬁdence and preference. To gain some intuition, the functional form of the learner is related to the Highest Rank combination method (Ho, 1992) that assigns combined ranks as the best rank each class receives from any ranker. This is a conﬁdence based approach, as Highest Rank bets on the classiﬁer that is most conﬁdent, the one giving the best rank. As such, a single learner can potentially be error prone. But as we combine many of these learners during boosting, it becomes more powerful, allowing the conﬁdence of different classiﬁers to be weighed with preference for their potential accuracy. 5.1 Learning At each boosting iteration, rather than selecting from all possible weak learners of form (Eq. 6), we limit our choices by building new weak learners out of the ones that have been previously trained. Let F = { f1 (x), . . . , fn (x)} be the set of ranking features. Recall that in rankboost H(x) = (t) (t) (t) ∑t wt ht (x), where ht (x) = min γ1 f1 (x), . . . , γn fn (x), 1 and γ j are learned coefﬁcients. We set (s) (s) Ht = h(x) h(x) = min γ1 f1 (x), . . . , γn fn (x) , s ≤ t and select ht+1 (x) from weak learners of the form hnew (x) = min αh(x), β f (x), 1 (7) (t+1) with h(x) ∈ Ht and f (x) ∈ F . This learner can be rewritten in the form of Eq. 6 with the γ j derived from the learned α, β, h(x) and f (x). Thus, at each iteration we look at combinations of 800 C ONCAVE L EARNERS FOR R ANKBOOST the features and existing learners. As discussed in the next section, we can either consider all such combinations, or use a heuristic selection strategy. We propose to optimize α and β separately, in stages. That is, given a value for one of the variables we optimize the other. As α and β are symmetric we show how to optimize β given α. We need to ﬁnd a value of β that maximizes r in Eq. 4. Freund et al. (2003) pointed out that this equation can be rewritten as: r = ∑ D(t) (x , x )(h(x ) − h(x )) x ,x = ∑ π(x)h(x) x where π(x) = ∑x D(t) (x , x) − D(t) (x, x ) . Given the form of Eq. 7 we can write r as a function of β, ∑ (β f (x) − 1) π(x) + ∑ r (β) = αh(x) − 1 π(x). β f j (x)≤min(αh(x),1) (8) αh(x) < 1 , then O(βl+1 ) = O(βl ) − π(xl ), P(βl+1 ) = P(βl ) − f (xl )π(xl ), Q(βl+1 ) = Q(βl ) +W π(xl ), R(βl+1 ) = R(βl ) +W αh(xl )π(xl ). Combining these formulas gives algorithm 2 for optimizing β. Algorithm 2 Algorithm for optimizing β Given α, h(x) ∈ Ht , f (x) ∈ F and the training instances. For all x’s generate and sort the set of candidate βs, B, such that β 1 ≤ β2 ≤ · · · ≤ β|B| and βl = min(αh(xl ),1) . f (xl ) O = ∑xl π(xl ) P = ∑xl f (xl )π(xl ) Q=0 R=0 rbest = 0 for j = 1 . . . |B| do r = βl P − O + R − Q if r > rbest then rbest = r end if O = O − π(xl ), P = P − f (xl )π(xl ) if αh(xl ) < 1 then Q = Q + π(xl ), R = R + αh(xl )π(xl ) end if end for 5.2 Heuristics for Learner Selection If at each boosting iteration we select from all combinations of h(x) and f (x) we end up with an O(T 2 ) algorithm, where T is the number of iterations. However, we can sacriﬁce accuracy for speed by only evaluating and selecting from a ﬁxed sized pool of previously trained learners h(x) and features f (x), where at each iteration the pool is randomly chosen from the full Ht and F . To improve performance, instead of using a uniform sampling distribution we can apply a heuristic to focus the distribution on combinations with better potential. As Eq. 8 is composed of two sums, for r to be large the terms f (x)π(x) and h(x)π(x) need to be large. We can consider s f = ∑x f (x)π(x) and sh = ∑x h(x)π(x) as indicators of how well these components work with π(x). Thus, we might expect larger r values to occur when these two score values are larger. Of course, we are discounting interactions, which is the reason for the combination. Using these score values, we can order all h(x) and f (x) separately, and sample such that learners and features with better scores are more likely to be selected. We opted for a polynomial weighting 802 C ONCAVE L EARNERS FOR R ANKBOOST Training error on Dup II 9 P=1 P=1/2 P=1/4 Avg rank of correct class 8.8 8.6 8.4 8.2 8 7.8 7.6 7.4 7.2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Iteration number Figure 2: These plots show convergence of training error for 3 values of the heuristic selection pressure value p. These plots are averages over 10 runs and are typical of the other training data sets as well. As can be seen the heuristic improves the convergence rate of the training error. method. Thus, for example, all f ∈ F are sorted by their score and are assigned a number based on the rank of these scores,(maxrank − rank)/maxrank, that gives each f an equally sized bin in the range 0 and 1. Given a random number ξ ∼ U(0, 1), we calculate ξ p and select the f that corresponds to the bin this number falls into. Here p < 1 can be construed as a selection pressure, where bins corresponding to higher scores are more likely to be selected. Figure 2 demonstrates the effect of different values of the p parameter in one of our experiments. 6. Face Recognition Experiments We present experiments on the combination of face recognizers, comparing the binary learner with the MWGR learner. Given an image of a face, a face recognizer assigns a similarity score to each of the faces it is trained to recognize. These scores give a linear order or ranking to the gallery of faces. Different face recognition algorithms have different performance characteristics. Thus, we explore how combining the outputs of multiple face recognizers can improve recognition accuracy. 6.1 Algorithm Methods We consider a data set I of face images (queries) to train on. For each query image, i in I, we need to rank all u ∈ U faces in the gallery. In rankboost the favor function, Φ, that speciﬁes output loss, is a function of the query and the item to be ranked. Therefore, the notational convention is to combine the query, i, and the item to be ranked, u, as an instance, x ≡ (i, u). As such, f j (x) = f j ((i, u)) is the 803 M ELNIK , VARDI AND Z HANG Error convergence 9 Train error on dup II Test error on dup I Avg rank of correct class 8.5 8 7.5 7 6.5 6 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Iteration number Figure 3: This plot is typical of the convergence behavior of rankboost with MWGR on the FERET data. Both training and test errors tended to converge within 10-30 iterations of boosting with no signiﬁcant post-convergence divergence. rank assigned to identity u for query image i by recognition algorithm j. As there is only one correct identity, we only care about the ranking of the one correct identity for each query. We set the favor function as stated by Freund et al. (2003) for this type of output loss. Let u ∗ be the the correct identity for training image i, then Φ ((i, u) , (i, u∗ )) = +1 and Φ ((i, u∗ ) , (i, u)) = −1 for all u = u∗ , setting all remaining elements of Φ (x , x ) = 0. That is, the correct identity of a query image is given positive favor compared to all other identities for that image, while all other rankings, including interactions between training images, are given zero favor. Note that since there is no favor interaction between queries (different i’s); Φ (x , x ) is effectively a function of 3 variables, (i, u , u ). Both weak learners were trained for 100 iterations, giving them ample time to converge. See Figure 3 for an illustration of convergence times. The binary learner was trained as speciﬁed by Freund et al. (2003). At each iteration the MWGR learner was selected from a pool of candidate combinations of f (x) and h(x), with a selection pressure of p = 0.5. For each candidate, ﬁrst β was optimized with α = 1, then α was optimized using the optimized β. The candidate with the most positive r value was always selected. This is summarized in algorithm 3. 6.2 Experimental Setup FERET (Phillips et al., 2000) was a government sponsored program for the evaluation of face recognition algorithms. In this program commercial and academic algorithms were evaluated on their ability to differentiate between 1,196 individuals. The test consisted of different data sets of varying difﬁculty, for a total of 3,816 different images. The data sets, in order of perceived difﬁculty, are: the fafb data set of 1,195 images which consists of pictures taken the same day with different facial 804 C ONCAVE L EARNERS FOR R ANKBOOST Algorithm 3 Algorithm for selecting learner from pool.

Note that in our experiments we separate the images of dup II from the dup I data set, unlike the FERET study where dup II was also a subset of dup I. The FERET study evaluated 10 baseline and proprietary face recognition algorithms. The baseline algorithms consisted of a correlation-based method and a number of eigenfaces (principle components) methods that differ in the internal metric they use. Of the proprietary algorithms, most were from different academic institutions and one was commercial. Of the 10 algorithms we selected three dominant algorithms. From the baseline algorithms we chose to use the ANM algorithm which uses a Mahalanobis distance variation on angular distances for eigenfaces (Moon and Phillips, 2001). While this algorithm’s performance is not distinctive, within the class of baseline algorithms it was strong. Moreover, in accuracy with respect to average rank of the correct class on the dup I data set it demonstrated superior performance to all other algorithms. The other two algorithms we used were the University of Maryland’s 1997 test submission (UMD) and the University of Southern California’s 1997 test submission (USC). These algorithms clearly outperformed the other algorithms. UMD is based on a discriminant analysis of eigenfaces (Zhao et al., 1998), and USC is an elastic bunch graph matching approach (Wiskott et al., 1997). The outputs of the 10 face recognizers on the four FERET data sets, fafb, fafc, dup I and dup II were the data for the experiments. Thus, we never had access to the actual classiﬁers, only to data on how they ranked the different faces in these data sets. We conducted experiments based on homogeneous and heterogeneous data sets, testing the efﬁciency and robustness (adaptivity) of the MWGR procedure. For the homogeneous case we took all 4 FERET data sets and randomly shufﬂed them together. We call this the homogeneous data set as both the training and testing data are selected from the same combined pool. On this combined data set we did 4-fold cross validation. For each fold 75% of the data was used for training and the rest for testing. We combined the results of all four runs together for evaluation purposes. 805 M ELNIK , VARDI AND Z HANG For the heterogeneous case, in each experiment one of the FERET data sets was selected as a training set and another data set was selected for testing. This gave 12 experiments (not including training and testing on the same data set) per group of face recognizers, where we get combinations of training on easy data sets and testing on hard data sets, training on hard and testing on easy data sets, and training and testing on hard data sets. To reduce noise in our experiments the training ranks were truncated at 150, and outliers were removed. In face recognition and other classiﬁcation applications usually only the top ranks are important. Thus, in evaluating the results we focused on the top 30 ranks. All ranks returned by a boosted combiner for the correct class above 30 were truncated to 30. In evaluating the performance of the combiners not all the test data are equally useful. We consider the following two cases as non informative. When the two best face recognizers, UMD and USC both give the correct class a rank of 1 there is very little reason for the combined rank to be different. Also when both the binary-learner-based combiner and the MWGR-based combiner give the correct class a rank greater than the truncation value (30) it makes little sense to compare between the combiners. The testing data was ﬁltered to remove these cases, and the results are presented without them. Before presenting the results, it should be said that rankboost with both learner types gives ranking functions that signiﬁcantly outperform all the individual face recognition algorithms. In addition, in our tests both learners also clearly outperformed other standard rank combination methods, such as the Borda count, highest rank and logistic regression (Ho et al., 1992). We present two sets of experiments—the combination of the 3 selected classiﬁers (ANM, UMD and USC) and the combination of all 10 classiﬁers. These are qualitatively different tasks. In combining 3, we seek to capitalize on the unique strengths of each classiﬁer. In combining 10, we are introducing classiﬁers which may be correlated and classiﬁers which are comparably much noisier. The size of the pool was 6 when we combined 3 classiﬁers and 20 when combining all 10 classiﬁers. For all experiments we measure the average rank of the correct class for both learners: A= 1 N ∑ min {Rank (xi∗ ) , 30} , N i=1 where Rank (xi∗ ) is the rank of the correct class for query i, and the sum is over all useful test queries, as described above. The average rank difference between the learners is calculated to show the improvement in performance. To evaluate the signiﬁcance of the improvement we ran paired one-sided t-tests and evaluated the signiﬁcance of the p-value (a value less than 0.05 is signiﬁcant). In addition we show the standard deviation of the rank difference. 6.3 Results In the experiments with the homogeneous data sets, combining all classiﬁers gives an improvement in the average rank of the correct class of 0.296 for MWGR, with a standard deviation of 3.9, a paired t-test statistic of 1.76 and p-value of 0.039, where combining the ANM, UMD and USC classiﬁers gives an average rank improvement of 0.1 for MWGR, with standard deviation of 3.6, a paired t-test statistic of 0.68 and p-value of 0.24. Table 2 contains the results for combining the 3 classiﬁers in the experiments with heterogeneous data sets (compare the combiner results in columns bin mean and mwgr mean with the aver806 C ONCAVE L EARNERS FOR R ANKBOOST ANM ARL EFAVG EFML1 EFML2 EXCA MSU RUT UMD USC dup i 9.52 16.85 15.02 18.23 15.85 11.9 17.64 17.87 13.21 12.44 dup ii 18.14 16.96 20.61 22.21 20.33 16.28 23.44 16.48 13.74 6.85 fafb 10.88 8.94 14.43 16.23 12.21 11.67 6.81 12.93 4.57 5.84 fafc 19.71 28.02 26.17 17.39 19.78 20.30 14.27 22.79 8.96 5.17 Table 1: The best average rank of the correct class on the different data sets for all constituent face recognition systems. age rank of the correct class for all constituent classiﬁers in Table 1). The diff mean column contains the improvement of MWGR over the binary learner in terms of average rank of the correct class. Of the 12 experiments, we see an improvement in 10 cases. Six of those 10 have signiﬁcant p-values. The two no improvement experiments do not have signiﬁcant p-values. Table 3 contains the results for combining all 10 classiﬁers. Of the 12 experiments, we see an improvement for MWGR in 11 cases. Eight or nine of those 11 have signiﬁcant p-values. The one no improvement experiment does not have a signiﬁcant p-value. It is interesting to note that we do not seem to see overﬁtting when increasing the number of constituents. In some case we see improvement, in others we see slight degradation, but all in all the combiner seems resilient to the noise of adding less informative constituents. All sets of experiments, homogeneous data, heterogeneous data sets, combining 3 select recognizers and combining all 10 recognizers at once yielded signiﬁcant improvements in accuracy, as is visible in the change in the average rank of the correct class and the signiﬁcance of the statistical tests. 7. Information Retrieval Experiments The annual Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) generates high-quality retrieval results of different systems on different retrieval tasks (Voorhees and Harman, 2001). We use the result data sets of the TREC-2001 web ad hoc task that uses actual web queries taken from web logs. This task has been used in other rank fusion experiments (Renda and Straccia, 2003). As did Renda and Straccia (2003) we combine the results of the following top 12 systems: iit01m, ok10wtnd1, csiro0mwal, ﬂabxtd, UniNEn7d, fub01be2, hum01tdlx, JuruFull, kuadhoc, ricMM, jscbtawtl4, apl10wd. Similar to other TREC information retrieval tasks, the TREC-2001 ad hoc task consists of 50 queries. For each query a list of relevant documents is supplied. Each system returns an ordered list of 1,000 documents for each query. The fusion goal is to combine these 12 individual lists into one list of 1,000 documents, which hopefully has greater precision than the individual systems.

Thus, we can set the favor function similarly to the way it was set in 808 C ONCAVE L EARNERS FOR R ANKBOOST JuruFull 0.759 hum01tdlx 0.760 UniNEn7d 0.763 iit01m 0.762 apl10wd 0.735 jscbtawt14 0.761 csiro0mwa1 0.721 kuadhoc2001 0.727 ﬂabxtd 0.741 ok10wtnd1 0.745 fub01be2 0.734 ricMM 0.765 Table 4: Normalized mean average precision for each constituent. the face recognition classiﬁcation task. Consider a data set with I queries to train on. For each query, i in I, we need to rank all u ∈ U documents. An instance in this case is a pair, x ≡ (i, u). For each u∗ a relevant document and u an irrelevant document for query i, we set Φ ((i, u) , (i, u ∗ )) = +1 and Φ ((i, u∗ ) , (i, u)) = −1, setting all remaining elements of Φ (x0 , x1 ) = 0. Thus, all relevant documents are given a positive favor with respect to irrelevant documents, while all other rankings, including interactions between relevant documents and interactions between irrelevant documents are given zero favor. As the task has only 50 queries, rather than separating the data into train and test, we opted to do a cross validation performance evaluation. We use 5-fold cross validation on the normalized mean average precision measure (Salton and McGill, 1983), a standard IR measure which accounts for the precision (quantity of correct documents retrieved) and their rank position in the list. It is described by the following equation: AveP = ∑N (Prec(r) × rel(r)) r=1 number o f relevant documents where r is the rank, N is the number of documents retrieved, rel() is a binary function of the relevance of the document at rank r,and Prec is the precision ( [number of relevant documents retrieved] / [number of documents retrieved]) at a given cut-off rank. It is clear that higher values of AveP are better. Note that for purposes of normalization we assigned unretrieved relevant documents a constant rank. As the binary and MWGR weak learners had signiﬁcantly different convergence properties on this task (see Figure 4) MWGR was trained for 100 iterations and the binary learner for 300 iterations. As in the FERET experiments, MWGR was optimized using algorithm 3, with a selection pressure of p = 0.5. 7.2 Results As seen in Figure 4, the MWGR learner converges in signiﬁcantly less iterations than the binary learner. This could possibly be attributed to the fact that the MWGR is a more complex function that can incorporate the rankings of multiple classiﬁers in each learner. Also the MWGR function is not tuned to particular rank cutoffs, whereas the binary learner is, so the MWGR can better accommodate the variety in the 1000 ranks being considered. The normalized mean average precision for the MWGR after 100 iterations was 0.8537 and it was 0.8508 for the binary learner after 300 iterations. Compare these results with the precision of the constituents in Table 4. Both weak learners had a performance rate of change of approximately 3 ∗ 10−5 on their ﬁnal iteration (better for MWGR). A paired t-test on the cross validation results of the two learners gives a statistically signiﬁcant p-value of 0.007 in favor of MWGR. 809 M ELNIK , VARDI AND Z HANG Cross Validation Performance 0.88 MWGR Binary 0.87 0.86 0.85 0.84 Mean Avg Precision 0.83 0.82 0.81 0.8 0.79 0.78 0.77 0.76 0.75 0.74 0.73 0.72 0.71 0.7 0 50 100 150 200 Iteration Number 250 300 Figure 4: The cross validation mean average precision score of the two weak learners, MWGR and binary, as a function of boosting iteration number. 8. Discussion The question of how to combine ordinal data has become an active focus of research in machine learning, as applications in pattern recognition, information retrieval and other domains have come to the forefront. A particular question of importance is how can the structure of ranks be correctly exploited to maximize performance. The semi parametric nature of rankboost offers the possibility to generate arbitrarily ﬂexible ranking functions. But as observed this ﬂexibility comes at a cost of signiﬁcant overﬁtting without further regularization. Freund et al. (2003) demonstrate that successful generalization only occurs when the resulting ranking functions are constrained to be monotonic. This constraint can be thought of as a regularization that incorporates prior knowledge on the interpretation of ranks and as such, how they can be combined. We present a regularization framework based on the concept of consistency in conﬁdence and preference. Ranking functions with this property show a consistency in how they treat the preference and relative conﬁdence exhibited by constituents. We prove that under a natural interpretation of preference and conﬁdence for ranks, this consistency property of the combiner is equivalent to monotonicity and concavity of its ranking function. We enhance rankboost by designing a weak ranking learner that exhibits consistency in preference and conﬁdence. A computational advantage of this weak learner, called minimum weighted group ranks (MWGR) is that its parameters can be individually optimized readily with respect to the rankboost criteria, allowing it to be tested on real-world data. In our ﬁrst experiments we compare the original rankboost binary weak learner with MWGR on a task of combining the output of multiple face recognition algorithms from the FERET study. We conducted experiments on homogeneous data, testing the intrinsic efﬁciency of the MWGR proce810 C ONCAVE L EARNERS FOR R ANKBOOST dure. We also conducted experiments on heterogeneous data, testing the robustness or adaptivity of the procedure. In almost all cases we see that MWGR shows improved performance compared with the binary weak learner, whether combining three or all of the face recognizers, conﬁrming the utility of this monotonic and concave learner. Our second experiment was on an Information Retrieval task taken from the TREC conference. In this task we see MWGR converges in signiﬁcantly less iterations and generates statistically signiﬁcant improved performance. Final Words Ofer Melnik and Cun-Hui Zhang are very saddened that our colleague and friend Yehuda Vardi passed away before he could give this paper his ﬁnal stamp of approval. He was very enthusiastic about this research and would have been very pleased to see it come to fruition.

In this paper we showed how three-point consistency in preference and conﬁdence implies concave and monotonic ranking functions. For two decision problems involving two pairs of rank vectors, the four-point consistency property implies the following constraints for a ranking function   G(y) < G(y )   yB − y B ≤ 0 < y A − y A  zA ≤ yA , yA − yA ≤ zA − zA ⇒ G(z ) − G(z) > G(y ) − G(y)   yB ≤ z B , zB − z B ≤ y B − y B (11) where y and y are the rank vectors from the ﬁrst decision problem and z and z are the rank vectors from the second decision problem. Unlike the three-point case, the four-point consistency property does not imply a clearly recognizable functional form for the ranking function. What we can say about it though is that as the constraints are linear, in the same way that concavity and monotonicity in the weak learner conferred the same properties to the ranking function, a weak learner that satisﬁes Eq. 11 will also confer those properties to the ranking function that uses it with positive weights.

<p>Author: Guy Lebanon, Yi Mao, Joshua Dillon</p><p>Abstract: The popular bag of words assumption represents a document as a histogram of word occurrences. While computationally efﬁcient, such a representation is unable to maintain any sequential information. We present an effective sequential document representation that goes beyond the bag of words representation and its n-gram extensions. This representation uses local smoothing to embed documents as smooth curves in the multinomial simplex thereby preserving valuable sequential information. In contrast to bag of words or n-grams, the new representation is able to robustly capture medium and long range sequential trends in the document. We discuss the representation and its geometric properties and demonstrate its applicability for various text processing tasks.

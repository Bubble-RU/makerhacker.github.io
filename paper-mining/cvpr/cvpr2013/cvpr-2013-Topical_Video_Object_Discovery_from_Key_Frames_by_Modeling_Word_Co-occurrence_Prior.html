<p>Author: Subhransu Maji, Gregory Shakhnarovich</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of part discovery when partial correspondence between instances of a category are available. For visual categories that exhibit high diversity in structure such as buildings, our approach can be used to discover parts that are hard to name, but can be easily expressed as a correspondence between pairs of images. Parts naturally emerge from point-wise landmark matches across many instances within a category. We propose a learning framework for automatic discovery of parts in such weakly supervised settings, and show the utility of the rich part library learned in this way for three tasks: object detection, category-specific saliency estimation, and fine-grained image parsing.</p><p>3 0.21364726 <a title="434-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Large-Scale_Video_Summarization_Using_Web-Image_Priors.html">243 cvpr-2013-Large-Scale Video Summarization Using Web-Image Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Aditya Khosla, Raffay Hamid, Chih-Jen Lin, Neel Sundaresan</p><p>Abstract: Given the enormous growth in user-generated videos, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to navigate them efficiently. As these videos are generally of poor quality, summarization methods designed for well-produced videos do not generalize to them. To address this challenge, we propose to use web-images as a prior to facilitate summarization of user-generated videos. Our main intuition is that people tend to take pictures of objects to capture them in a maximally informative way. Such images could therefore be used as prior information to summarize videos containing a similar set of objects. In this work, we apply our novel insight to develop a summarization algorithm that uses the web-image based prior information in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, to automatically evaluate summarization algorithms on a large scale, we propose a framework that relies on multiple summaries obtained through crowdsourcing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our evaluation framework by comparing its performance to that ofmultiple human evaluators. Finally, wepresent resultsfor our framework tested on hundreds of user-generated videos.</p><p>4 0.1732886 <a title="434-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Fast_Approximate_AIB_Algorithm_for_Distributional_Word_Clustering.html">8 cvpr-2013-A Fast Approximate AIB Algorithm for Distributional Word Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Wang, Jianjia Zhang, Luping Zhou, Wanqing Li</p><p>Abstract: Distributional word clustering merges the words having similar probability distributions to attain reliable parameter estimation, compact classification models and even better classification performance. Agglomerative Information Bottleneck (AIB) is one of the typical word clustering algorithms and has been applied to both traditional text classification and recent image recognition. Although enjoying theoretical elegance, AIB has one main issue on its computational efficiency, especially when clustering a large number of words. Different from existing solutions to this issue, we analyze the characteristics of its objective function the loss of mutual information, and show that by merely using the ratio of word-class joint probabilities of each word, good candidate word pairs for merging can be easily identified. Based on this finding, we propose a fast approximate AIB algorithm and show that it can significantly improve the computational efficiency of AIB while well maintaining or even slightly increasing its classification performance. Experimental study on both text and image classification benchmark data sets shows that our algorithm can achieve more than 100 times speedup on large real data sets over the state-of-the-art method.</p><p>5 0.16882601 <a title="434-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Joint_3D_Scene_Reconstruction_and_Class_Segmentation.html">230 cvpr-2013-Joint 3D Scene Reconstruction and Class Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Häne, Christopher Zach, Andrea Cohen, Roland Angst, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Both image segmentation and dense 3D modeling from images represent an intrinsically ill-posed problem. Strong regularizers are therefore required to constrain the solutions from being ’too noisy’. Unfortunately, these priors generally yield overly smooth reconstructions and/or segmentations in certain regions whereas they fail in other areas to constrain the solution sufficiently. In this paper we argue that image segmentation and dense 3D reconstruction contribute valuable information to each other’s task. As a consequence, we propose a rigorous mathematical framework to formulate and solve a joint segmentation and dense reconstruction problem. Image segmentations provide geometric cues about which surface orientations are more likely to appear at a certain location in space whereas a dense 3D reconstruction yields a suitable regularization for the segmentation problem by lifting the labeling from 2D images to 3D space. We show how appearance-based cues and 3D surface orientation priors can be learned from training data and subsequently used for class-specific regularization. Experimental results on several real data sets highlight the advantages of our joint formulation.</p><p>6 0.16745034 <a title="434-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Bayesian_Approach_to_Multimodal_Visual_Dictionary_Learning.html">5 cvpr-2013-A Bayesian Approach to Multimodal Visual Dictionary Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Pradipto Das, Chenliang Xu, Richard F. Doell, Jason J. Corso</p><p>Abstract: The problem of describing images through natural language has gained importance in the computer vision community. Solutions to image description have either focused on a top-down approach of generating language through combinations of object detections and language models or bottom-up propagation of keyword tags from training images to test images through probabilistic or nearest neighbor techniques. In contrast, describing videos with natural language is a less studied problem. In this paper, we combine ideas from the bottom-up and top-down approaches to image description and propose a method for video description that captures the most relevant contents of a video in a natural language description. We propose a hybrid system consisting of a low level multimodal latent topic model for initial keyword annotation, a middle level of concept detectors and a high level module to produce final lingual descriptions. We compare the results of our system to human descriptions in both short and long forms on two datasets, and demonstrate that final system output has greater agreement with the human descriptions than any single level.</p><p>3 0.73221511 <a title="434-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Fast_Approximate_AIB_Algorithm_for_Distributional_Word_Clustering.html">8 cvpr-2013-A Fast Approximate AIB Algorithm for Distributional Word Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Zheng Lu, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We present a video summarization approach that discovers the story of an egocentric video. Given a long input video, our method selects a short chain of video subshots depicting the essential events. Inspired by work in text analysis that links news articles over time, we define a randomwalk based metric of influence between subshots that reflects how visual objects contribute to the progression of events. Using this influence metric, we define an objective for the optimal k-subshot summary. Whereas traditional methods optimize a summary ’s diversity or representativeness, ours explicitly accounts for how one sub-event “leads to ” another—which, critically, captures event connectivity beyond simple object co-occurrence. As a result, our summaries provide a better sense of story. We apply our approach to over 12 hours of daily activity video taken from 23 unique camera wearers, and systematically evaluate its quality compared to multiple baselines with 34 human subjects.</p><p>6 0.64333856 <a title="434-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Lp-Norm_IDF_for_Large_Scale_Image_Search.html">275 cvpr-2013-Lp-Norm IDF for Large Scale Image Search</a></p>

Our experiments on challenging videos demonstrate that the proposed approach can discover different types of topical objects despite variations in scale, view-point, color and lighting changes, or even partial occlusions. The efficacy of the co-occurrence prior is clearly demonstrated when comparing with topic models without such priors.</p><p>2 0.90931642 <a title="434-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Sampling_Strategies_for_Real-Time_Action_Recognition.html">378 cvpr-2013-Sampling Strategies for Real-Time Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Feng Shi, Emil Petriu, Robert Laganière</p><p>Abstract: Local spatio-temporal features and bag-of-features representations have become popular for action recognition. A recent trend is to use dense sampling for better performance. While many methods claimed to use dense feature sets, most of them are just denser than approaches based on sparse interest point detectors. In this paper, we explore sampling with high density on action recognition. We also investigate the impact of random sampling over dense grid for computational efficiency. We present a real-time action recognition system which integrates fast random sampling method with local spatio-temporal features extracted from a Local Part Model. A new method based on histogram intersection kernel is proposed to combine multiple channels of different descriptors. Our technique shows high accuracy on the simple KTH dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art on two very challenging real-world datasets, namely, 93% on KTH, 83.3% on UCF50 and 47.6% on HMDB51.</p><p>3 0.90858525 <a title="434-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Detector_Adaptation_for_Object_Detection_in_a_Video.html">142 cvpr-2013-Efficient Detector Adaptation for Object Detection in a Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Pramod Sharma, Ram Nevatia</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we present a novel and efficient detector adaptation method which improves the performance of an offline trained classifier (baseline classifier) by adapting it to new test datasets. We address two critical aspects of adaptation methods: generalizability and computational efficiency. We propose an adaptation method, which can be applied to various baseline classifiers and is computationally efficient also. For a given test video, we collect online samples in an unsupervised manner and train a randomfern adaptive classifier . The adaptive classifier improves precision of the baseline classifier by validating the obtained detection responses from baseline classifier as correct detections or false alarms. Experiments demonstrate generalizability, computational efficiency and effectiveness of our method, as we compare our method with state of the art approaches for the problem of human detection and show good performance with high computational efficiency on two different baseline classifiers.</p><p>4 0.90799636 <a title="434-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-task_Sparse_Learning_with_Beta_Process_Prior_for_Action_Recognition.html">302 cvpr-2013-Multi-task Sparse Learning with Beta Process Prior for Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunfeng Yuan, Weiming Hu, Guodong Tian, Shuang Yang, Haoran Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we formulate human action recognition as a novel Multi-Task Sparse Learning(MTSL) framework which aims to construct a test sample with multiple features from as few bases as possible. Learning the sparse representation under each feature modality is considered as a single task in MTSL. Since the tasks are generated from multiple features associated with the same visual input, they are not independent but inter-related. We introduce a Beta process(BP) prior to the hierarchical MTSL model, which efficiently learns a compact dictionary and infers the sparse structure shared across all the tasks. The MTSL model enforces the robustness in coefficient estimation compared with performing each task independently. Besides, the sparseness is achieved via the Beta process formulation rather than the computationally expensive l1 norm penalty. In terms of non-informative gamma hyper-priors, the sparsity level is totally decided by the data. Finally, the learning problem is solved by Gibbs sampling inference which estimates the full posterior on the model parameters. Experimental results on the KTH and UCF sports datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MTSL approach for action recognition.</p><p>5 0.90797114 <a title="434-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Recognize_Human_Activities_from_Partially_Observed_Videos.html">347 cvpr-2013-Recognize Human Activities from Partially Observed Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Cao, Daniel Barrett, Andrei Barbu, Siddharth Narayanaswamy, Haonan Yu, Aaron Michaux, Yuewei Lin, Sven Dickinson, Jeffrey Mark Siskind, Song Wang</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing human activities in partially observed videos is a challengingproblem and has many practical applications. When the unobserved subsequence is at the end of the video, the problem is reduced to activity prediction from unfinished activity streaming, which has been studied by many researchers. However, in the general case, an unobserved subsequence may occur at any time by yielding a temporal gap in the video. In this paper, we propose a new method that can recognize human activities from partially observed videos in the general case. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a probabilistic framework: 1) dividing each activity into multiple ordered temporal segments, 2) using spatiotemporal features of the training video samples in each segment as bases and applying sparse coding (SC) to derive the activity likelihood of the test video sample at each segment, and 3) finally combining the likelihood at each segment to achieve a global posterior for the activities. We further extend the proposed method to include more bases that correspond to a mixture of segments with different temporal lengths (MSSC), which can better rep- resent the activities with large intra-class variations. We evaluate the proposed methods (SC and MSSC) on various real videos. We also evaluate the proposed methods on two special cases: 1) activity prediction where the unobserved subsequence is at the end of the video, and 2) human activity recognition on fully observed videos. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform existing state-of-the-art comparison methods.</p><p>6 0.90736276 <a title="434-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Joint_Sparsity-Based_Representation_and_Analysis_of_Unconstrained_Activities.html">233 cvpr-2013-Joint Sparsity-Based Representation and Analysis of Unconstrained Activities</a></p>

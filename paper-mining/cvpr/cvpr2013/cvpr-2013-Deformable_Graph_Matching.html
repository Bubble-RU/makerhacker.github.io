</p><p>11 decades, there are still two main challenges: (1) Many matching problems in computer vision naturally require global constraints among nodes in the graph. [sent-36, score-0.121]
</p><p>12 For instance, given two sets of coplanar points in two images, the matching between points should be constrained by an affine transformation (under orthographic projection). [sent-37, score-0.18]

</p><p>15 In order to incorporate global transformations, the key 222999222200  idea of our method is to factorize the pairwise affinity matrix into matrices that preserve the local structure of each graph and matrices that encode the similarity between nodes and edges. [sent-45, score-0.519]
</p><p>16 This factorization is general and can be applied to both directed and undirected graphs. [sent-46, score-0.397]
</p><p>17 Using the factorization, we are able to factorize the large 20-by-20 pair-wise affinity matrix into six smaller matrices. [sent-49, score-0.239]
</p><p>18 Because we have decoupled the local structure for the nodes in each graph, it is easy to add global geometric constraints. [sent-50, score-0.096]
</p><p>19 Moreover, using this factorization has three additional benefits for GM. [sent-51, score-0.177]
</p><p>20 First, there is no need to compute the costly (in space and time) pair-wise affinity matrix. [sent-52, score-0.163]
</p><p>21 Third, it allows the use of path-following optimization algorithms in general GM problems that leads to improved optimization strategies and matching performance. [sent-55, score-0.105]
</p><p>22 We illustrate the benefits of DGM in synthetic and real matching experiments on standard databases. [sent-56, score-0.126]
</p><p>23 Graph matching (GM) We denote (see notation1) a graph with n nodes and m directed edges as a 4-tuple G = {P, Q, G, H}. [sent-60, score-0.341]

</p><p>26 However, the work in [29] is only valid for undirected graphs. [sent-68, score-0.105]
</p><p>27 Our representation is more general and valid for directed and undirected graphs. [sent-69, score-0.22]
</p><p>28 Directed graphs typically occur when the features are asymmetrical such as the angle between an edge and the horizontal line. [sent-70, score-0.185]

</p><p>34 The inequality in the above definition is used for the case when the graphs are of different sizes. [sent-109, score-0.108]
</p><p>35 However, these methods can only work for a restricted case, where K = K1 ⊗ K2 is composed by two weighted adjacency matrices, K⊗1 K∈ Rn1 ×n1 and K2 ∈ Rn2 ×n2, defined on each graph respectively. [sent-119, score-0.138]

</p><p>40 Our work is closely related to recent higher-order tensor factorization [5, 9, 26]. [sent-145, score-0.177]
</p><p>41 In order to make GM invariant to rigid deformations, [5, 9, 26] extended the pairwise matrix K embedded into a tensor that encodes highorder geometrical relations. [sent-147, score-0.098]
</p><p>42 Therefore, most of high-order GM methods can only work on very sparse graphs with no more than 3-order features. [sent-149, score-0.108]

</p><p>47 As we will see in the following sections, this factorization allows the unification of GM methods, adding geometric constraints to GM and elaborating better optimization strategies. [sent-191, score-0.266]
</p><p>48 222999222422  To illustrate the intuition behind the factorization, let us consider the synthetic graph shown in Fig. [sent-192, score-0.149]
</p><p>49 Notice that K ∈ Rn1n2 ×n1n2 is composed by two types of affinities: Kthe ∈nod Re affinity (Kp) on its diagonal and the pairwise edge affinity (Kq) on its off-diagonals. [sent-194, score-0.464]
</p><p>50 (4)  This factorization decouples the graph structure (G1, H1, G2 and H2) from the similarity (Kp and Kq). [sent-205, score-0.286]
</p><p>51 It is important to notice that our factorization significantly differs from the one proposed in [29] in two aspects: (1) Eq. [sent-206, score-0.177]

</p><p>59 Deformable graph matching (DGM) This section describes how to incorporate rigid and nonrigid transformation into the GM framework. [sent-278, score-0.302]
</p><p>60 Moreover, we illustrate how the factorization can be used into the DGM to derive an improved optimization strategy. [sent-279, score-0.232]

</p><p>74 In the third experiment we add a known geometrical transformation between graphs and compare it with ICP algorithm on the problem of matching non-rigid shapes. [sent-401, score-0.253]
</p><p>75 CMU house image dataset The CMU house image dataset consists of 111 frames of a house, each of which has been manually labeled with 30 landmarks. [sent-404, score-0.1]
</p><p>76 In this experiment, we focused on the simple case, where the edge is undirected and the edge feature is symmetric. [sent-406, score-0.259]
</p><p>77 In particular, the edge feature qc was com-  puted as the pairwise distance between the connected nodes. [sent-407, score-0.19]
</p><p>78 We compared FGM-D against eight state-of-the-art algorithms: GA [11], SM [14], SMAC [8], IPFP [15] initialized with a uniform correspondence (IPFPU) and spectral matching (IPFP-S), PM [26], RRWM [6] and FGM for Undirected graphs (FGM-U) [29]. [sent-410, score-0.268]
</p><p>79 This is because FGMU can be considered as a special case of FGM-D when the graph only has undirected edges. [sent-422, score-0.187]
</p><p>80 Car and motorbike image dataset  The car and motorbike image dataset was created in [16]. [sent-425, score-0.157]
</p><p>81 This dataset consists of 30 pairs of car images and 20 pairs of motorbike images. [sent-426, score-0.094]
</p><p>82 In this experiment, we consider the most general graph where the edge is directed and the edge feature is asymmetrical. [sent-430, score-0.351]
</p><p>83 More specifically, each edge was represented by a couple of values, qc = [dc, θc]T, where dc is the pairwise distance between the connected nodes and θc is the angle between the edge and the horizontal line. [sent-431, score-0.304]
</p><p>84 Thus, for each pair of images, we computed the node affinity as kipj = exp(−|pi − pj |) and the edge affinity as kcq1c2 = exp(−21 |dc1 − dc2 | −21 |θc1 − θc2 |). [sent-432, score-0.477]
</p><p>85 However, we were unable to directly use FGM-U to match directed graphs. [sent-440, score-0.115]
</p><p>86 Therefore, we ran FGM-U on an approximated undirected graph, where for each pair of directed edges, we computed its new edge affinity as the average value of the original ones. [sent-441, score-0.483]
</p><p>87 On the other hand, although FGM-U has a similar path-following strategy, it did not perform well because it is only applicable to undirected edges. [sent-445, score-0.105]
</p><p>88 Finally, it is important to remind the reader that without the factorization proposed in this work it is not possible to apply the path-following method to general graphs. [sent-446, score-0.177]

</p><p>91 Recall that DGM simultaneously computes the correspondence and the rotation. [sent-508, score-0.101]
</p><p>92 In addition, we tested the performance of our algorithm (FGM-D) only using the path-following algorithm for computing the correspondence but without estimating the transformation. [sent-522, score-0.101]

<p>Author: Nan Hu, Raif M. Rustamov, Leonidas Guibas</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the weighted graph matching problem with partially disclosed correspondences between a number of anchor nodes. Our construction exploits recently introduced node signatures based on graph Laplacians, namely the Laplacian family signature (LFS) on the nodes, and the pairwise heat kernel map on the edges. In this paper, without assuming an explicit form of parametric dependence nor a distance metric between node signatures, we formulate an optimization problem which incorporates the knowledge of anchor nodes. Solving this problem gives us an optimized proximity measure specific to the graphs under consideration. Using this as a first order compatibility term, we then set up an integer quadratic program (IQP) to solve for a near optimal graph matching. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on randomly generated graphs and on two widelyused image sequences, when compared with other existing signature and adjacency matrix based graph matching methods.</p><p>3 0.120741 <a title="106-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Estimation_of_Nonrigid_Transformation_for_Point_Set_Registration.html">360 cvpr-2013-Robust Estimation of Nonrigid Transformation for Point Set Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiayi Ma, Ji Zhao, Jinwen Tian, Zhuowen Tu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We present a new point matching algorithm for robust nonrigid registration. The method iteratively recovers the point correspondence and estimates the transformation between two point sets. In the first step of the iteration, feature descriptors such as shape context are used to establish rough correspondence. In the second step, we estimate the transformation using a robust estimator called L2E. This is the main novelty of our approach and it enables us to deal with the noise and outliers which arise in the correspondence step. The transformation is specified in a functional space, more specifically a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We apply our method to nonrigid sparse image feature correspondence on 2D images and 3D surfaces. Our results quantitatively show that our approach outperforms state-ofthe-art methods, particularly when there are a large number of outliers. Moreover, our method of robustly estimating transformations from correspondences is general and has many other applications.</p><p>4 0.077990085 <a title="106-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Lagrangian_Relaxation_to_Min-cost_Network_Flow.html">300 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Asad A. Butt, Robert T. Collins</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for global multi-target tracking that can incorporate higher-order track smoothness constraints such as constant velocity. Our problem formulation readily lends itself to path estimation in a trellis graph, but unlike previous methods, each node in our network represents a candidate pair of matching observations between consecutive frames. Extra constraints on binary flow variables in the graph result in a problem that can no longer be solved by min-cost network flow. We therefore propose an iterative solution method that relaxes these extra constraints using Lagrangian relaxation, resulting in a series of problems that ARE solvable by min-cost flow, and that progressively improve towards a high-quality solution to our original optimization problem. We present experimental results showing that our method outperforms the standard network-flow formulation as well as other recent algorithms that attempt to incorporate higher-order smoothness constraints.</p><p>5 0.076682433 <a title="106-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Deformable_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Fast_Dense_Correspondences.html">107 cvpr-2013-Deformable Spatial Pyramid Matching for Fast Dense Correspondences</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaechul Kim, Ce Liu, Fei Sha, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a fast deformable spatial pyramid (DSP) matching algorithm for computing dense pixel correspondences. Dense matching methods typically enforce both appearance agreement between matched pixels as well as geometric smoothness between neighboring pixels. Whereas the prevailing approaches operate at the pixel level, we propose a pyramid graph model that simultaneously regularizes match consistency at multiple spatial extents—ranging from an entire image, to coarse grid cells, to every single pixel. This novel regularization substantially improves pixel-level matching in the face of challenging image variations, while the “deformable ” aspect of our model overcomes the strict rigidity of traditional spatial pyramids. Results on LabelMe and Caltech show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods (SIFT Flow [15] and PatchMatch [2]), both in terms of accuracy and run time.</p><p>6 0.076170154 <a title="106-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Consensus_of_k-NNs_for_Robust_Neighborhood_Selection_on_Graph-Based_Manifolds.html">91 cvpr-2013-Consensus of k-NNs for Robust Neighborhood Selection on Graph-Based Manifolds</a></p>

Although widely used, existing GM algorithms cannot incorporate global consistence among nodes, which is a natural constraint in computer vision problems. This paper proposes deformable graph matching (DGM), an extension of GM for matching graphs subject to global rigid and non-rigid geometric constraints. The key idea of this work is a new factorization of the pair-wise affinity matrix. This factorization decouples the affinity matrix into the local structure of each graph and the pair-wise affinity edges. Besides the ability to incorporate global geometric transformations, this factorization offers three more benefits. First, there is no need to compute the costly (in space and time) pair-wise affinity matrix. Second, it provides a unified view of many GM methods and extends the standard iterative closest point algorithm. Third, it allows to use the path-following optimization algorithm that leads to improved optimization strategies and matching performance. Experimental results on synthetic and real databases illustrate how DGM outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for GM.

<p>Author: Nan Hu, Raif M.

Our construction exploits recently introduced node signatures based on graph Laplacians, namely the Laplacian family signature (LFS) on the nodes, and the pairwise heat kernel map on the edges. In this paper, without assuming an explicit form of parametric dependence nor a distance metric between node signatures, we formulate an optimization problem which incorporates the knowledge of anchor nodes. Solving this problem gives us an optimized proximity measure specific to the graphs under consideration. Using this as a first order compatibility term, we then set up an integer quadratic program (IQP) to solve for a near optimal graph matching.

<p>Author: Hu Ding, Branislav Stojkovic, Ronald Berezney, Jinhui Xu</p><p>Abstract: Computing accurate and robust organizational patterns of chromosome territories inside the cell nucleus is critical for understanding several fundamental genomic processes, such as co-regulation of gene activation, gene silencing, X chromosome inactivation, and abnormal chromosome rearrangement in cancer cells. The usage of advanced fluorescence labeling and image processing techniques has enabled researchers to investigate interactions of chromosome territories at large spatial resolution. The resulting high volume of generated data demands for high-throughput and automated image analysis methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithmic tool for investigating association patterns of chromosome territories in a population of cells. Our method takes as input a set of graphs, one for each cell, containing information about spatial interaction of chromosome territories, and yields a single graph that contains essential information for the whole population and stands as its structural representative. We formulate this combinato- rial problem as a semi-definite programming and present novel techniques to efficiently solve it. We validate our approach on both artificial and real biological data; the experimental results suggest that our approach yields a nearoptimal solution, and can handle large-size datasets, which are significant improvements over existing techniques.</p><p>4 0.71561289 <a title="106-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Consensus_of_k-NNs_for_Robust_Neighborhood_Selection_on_Graph-Based_Manifolds.html">91 cvpr-2013-Consensus of k-NNs for Robust Neighborhood Selection on Graph-Based Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Vittal Premachandran, Ramakrishna Kakarala</p><p>Abstract: Propagating similarity information along the data manifold requires careful selection of local neighborhood. Selecting a “good” neighborhood in an unsupervised setting, given an affinity graph, has been a difficult task. The most common way to select a local neighborhood has been to use the k-nearest neighborhood (k-NN) selection criterion. However, it has the tendency to include noisy edges. In this paper, we propose a way to select a robust neighborhood using the consensus of multiple rounds of k-NNs. We explain how using consensus information can give better control over neighborhood selection. We also explain in detail the problems with another recently proposed neighborhood selection criteria, i.e., Dominant Neighbors, and show that our method is immune to those problems. Finally, we show the results from experiments in which we compare our method to other neighborhood selection approaches. The results corroborate our claims that consensus ofk-NNs does indeed help in selecting more robust and stable localities.</p><p>5 0.65554118 <a title="106-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Fast_Semidefinite_Approach_to_Solving_Binary_Quadratic_Problems.html">9 cvpr-2013-A Fast Semidefinite Approach to Solving Binary Quadratic Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Wang, Chunhua Shen, Anton van_den_Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Many computer vision problems can be formulated as binary quadratic programs (BQPs). Two classic relaxation methods are widely used for solving BQPs, namely, spectral methods and semidefinite programming (SDP), each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Spectral relaxation is simple and easy to implement, but its bound is loose. Semidefinite relaxation has a tighter bound, but its computational complexity is high for large scale problems. We present a new SDP formulation for BQPs, with two desirable properties. First, it has a similar relaxation bound to conventional SDP formulations. Second, compared with conventional SDP methods, the new SDP formulation leads to a significantly more efficient and scalable dual optimization approach, which has the same degree of complexity as spectral methods. Extensive experiments on various applications including clustering, image segmentation, co-segmentation and registration demonstrate the usefulness of our SDP formulation for solving large-scale BQPs.</p><p>6 0.65463072 <a title="106-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-The_Generalized_Laplacian_Distance_and_Its_Applications_for_Visual_Matching.html">429 cvpr-2013-The Generalized Laplacian Distance and Its Applications for Visual Matching</a></p>

Past methods for capturing the spectral reflectance of scenes has proven successful in relighting but they all share a common assumption. All the methods do not consider the effects of fluorescence despite fluorescence being found in many everyday objects. In this paper, we describe the very different ways that reflectance and fluorescence interact with illuminants and show the need to explicitly consider fluorescence in the relighting problem. We then propose a robust method based on well established theories of reflectance and fluorescence for imaging each of these components. Finally, we show that we can relight real scenes of reflective-fluorescent surfaces with much higher accuracy in comparison to only considering the reflective component.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.8584103 <a title="106-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Deformable_Graph_Matching.html">106 cvpr-2013-Deformable Graph Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Horst Possegger, Sabine Sternig, Thomas Mauthner, Peter M. Roth, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: Combining foreground images from multiple views by projecting them onto a common ground-plane has been recently applied within many multi-object tracking approaches. These planar projections introduce severe artifacts and constrain most approaches to objects moving on a common 2D ground-plane. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of an occupancy volume exploiting the full geometry and the objects ’ center of mass and develop an efficient algorithm for 3D object tracking. Individual objects are tracked using the local mass density scores within a particle filter based approach, constrained by a Voronoi partitioning between nearby trackers. Our method benefits from the geometric knowledge given by the occupancy volume to robustly extract features and train classifiers on-demand, when volumetric information becomes unreliable. We evaluate our approach on several challenging real-world scenarios including the public APIDIS dataset. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-theart methods, while achieving real-time performance. – –</p><p>5 0.80014026 <a title="106-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Collections_of_Part_Models_for_Object_Recognition.html">248 cvpr-2013-Learning Collections of Part Models for Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Uwe Schmidt, Carsten Rother, Sebastian Nowozin, Jeremy Jancsary, Stefan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Non-blind deblurring is an integral component of blind approaches for removing image blur due to camera shake. Even though learning-based deblurring methods exist, they have been limited to the generative case and are computationally expensive. To this date, manually-defined models are thus most widely used, though limiting the attained restoration quality. We address this gap by proposing a discriminative approach for non-blind deblurring. One key challenge is that the blur kernel in use at test time is not known in advance. To address this, we analyze existing approaches that use half-quadratic regularization. From this analysis, we derive a discriminative model cascade for image deblurring. Our cascade model consists of a Gaussian CRF at each stage, based on the recently introduced regression tree fields. We train our model by loss minimization and use synthetically generated blur kernels to generate training data. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is efficient and yields state-of-the-art restoration quality on images corrupted with synthetic and real blur.</p><p>3 0.57530218 <a title="449-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_to_Estimate_and_Remove_Non-uniform_Image_Blur.html">265 cvpr-2013-Learning to Estimate and Remove Non-uniform Image Blur</a></p>
<p>Author: Florent Couzinié-Devy, Jian Sun, Karteek Alahari, Jean Ponce</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of restoring images subjected to unknown and spatially varying blur caused by defocus or linear (say, horizontal) motion. The estimation of the global (non-uniform) image blur is cast as a multilabel energy minimization problem. The energy is the sum of unary terms corresponding to learned local blur estimators, and binary ones corresponding to blur smoothness. Its global minimum is found using Ishikawa ’s method by exploiting the natural order of discretized blur values for linear motions and defocus. Once the blur has been estimated, the image is restored using a robust (non-uniform) deblurring algorithm based on sparse regularization with global image statistics. The proposed algorithm outputs both a segmentation of the image into uniform-blur layers and an estimate of the corresponding sharp image. We present qualitative results on real images, and use synthetic data to quantitatively compare our approach to the publicly available implementation of Chakrabarti et al. [5].</p><p>4 0.48019323 <a title="449-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_3D_Reconstruction_from_Severely_Blurred_Images_Using_a_Single_Moving_Camera.html">108 cvpr-2013-Dense 3D Reconstruction from Severely Blurred Images Using a Single Moving Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Hee Seok Lee, Kuoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: Motion blur frequently occurs in dense 3D reconstruction using a single moving camera, and it degrades the quality of the 3D reconstruction. To handle motion blur caused by rapid camera shakes, we propose a blur-aware depth reconstruction method, which utilizes a pixel correspondence that is obtained by considering the effect of motion blur. Motion blur is dependent on 3D geometry, thus parameterizing blurred appearance of images with scene depth given camera motion is possible and a depth map can be accurately estimated from the blur-considered pixel correspondence. The estimated depth is then converted intopixel-wise blur kernels, and non-uniform motion blur is easily removed with low computational cost. The obtained blur kernel is depth-dependent, thus it effectively addresses scene-depth variation, which is a challenging problem in conventional non-uniform deblurring methods.</p><p>5 0.47676325 <a title="449-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-image_Blind_Deblurring_Using_a_Coupled_Adaptive_Sparse_Prior.html">295 cvpr-2013-Multi-image Blind Deblurring Using a Coupled Adaptive Sparse Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Haichao Zhang, David Wipf, Yanning Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a robust algorithm for estimating a single latent sharp image given multiple blurry and/or noisy observations. The underlying multi-image blind deconvolution problem is solved by linking all of the observations together via a Bayesian-inspired penalty function which couples the unknown latent image, blur kernels, and noise levels together in a unique way. This coupled penalty function enjoys a number of desirable properties, including a mechanism whereby the relative-concavity or shape is adapted as a function of the intrinsic quality of each blurry observation. In this way, higher quality observations may automatically contribute more to the final estimate than heavily degraded ones. The resulting algorithm, which requires no essential tuning parameters, can recover a high quality image from a set of observations containing potentially both blurry and noisy examples, without knowing a priorithe degradation type of each observation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world test images clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</p><p>6 0.42488575 <a title="449-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Handling_Noise_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_Using_Directional_Filters.html">198 cvpr-2013-Handling Noise in Single Image Deblurring Using Directional Filters</a></p>

<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Keigo Hirakawa</p><p>Abstract: We propose a notion of double discrete wavelet transform (DDWT) that is designed to sparsify the blurred image and the blur kernel simultaneously. DDWT greatly enhances our ability to analyze, detect, and process blur kernels and blurry images—the proposed framework handles both global and spatially varying blur kernels seamlessly, and unifies the treatment of blur caused by object motion, optical defocus, and camera shake. To illustrate the potential of DDWT in computer vision and image processing, we develop example applications in blur kernel estimation, deblurring, and near-blur-invariant image feature extraction.</p><p>3 0.93050426 <a title="449-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-image_Blind_Deblurring_Using_a_Coupled_Adaptive_Sparse_Prior.html">295 cvpr-2013-Multi-image Blind Deblurring Using a Coupled Adaptive Sparse Prior</a></p>

<p>Author: Horst Possegger, Sabine Sternig, Thomas Mauthner, Peter M. Roth, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: Combining foreground images from multiple views by projecting them onto a common ground-plane has been recently applied within many multi-object tracking approaches. These planar projections introduce severe artifacts and constrain most approaches to objects moving on a common 2D ground-plane. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of an occupancy volume exploiting the full geometry and the objects ’ center of mass and develop an efficient algorithm for 3D object tracking. Individual objects are tracked using the local mass density scores within a particle filter based approach, constrained by a Voronoi partitioning between nearby trackers. Our method benefits from the geometric knowledge given by the occupancy volume to robustly extract features and train classifiers on-demand, when volumetric information becomes unreliable. We evaluate our approach on several challenging real-world scenarios including the public APIDIS dataset. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-theart methods, while achieving real-time performance. – –</p><p>3 0.65277117 <a title="449-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_to_Estimate_and_Remove_Non-uniform_Image_Blur.html">265 cvpr-2013-Learning to Estimate and Remove Non-uniform Image Blur</a></p>
<p>Author: Florent Couzinié-Devy, Jian Sun, Karteek Alahari, Jean Ponce</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of restoring images subjected to unknown and spatially varying blur caused by defocus or linear (say, horizontal) motion. The estimation of the global (non-uniform) image blur is cast as a multilabel energy minimization problem. The energy is the sum of unary terms corresponding to learned local blur estimators, and binary ones corresponding to blur smoothness. Its global minimum is found using Ishikawa ’s method by exploiting the natural order of discretized blur values for linear motions and defocus. Once the blur has been estimated, the image is restored using a robust (non-uniform) deblurring algorithm based on sparse regularization with global image statistics. The proposed algorithm outputs both a segmentation of the image into uniform-blur layers and an estimate of the corresponding sharp image. We present qualitative results on real images, and use synthetic data to quantitatively compare our approach to the publicly available implementation of Chakrabarti et al. [5].</p><p>4 0.64057398 <a title="449-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Sparse_Subspace_Denoising_for_Image_Manifolds.html">405 cvpr-2013-Sparse Subspace Denoising for Image Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Wang, Zhuowen Tu</p><p>Abstract: With the increasing availability of high dimensional data and demand in sophisticated data analysis algorithms, manifold learning becomes a critical technique to perform dimensionality reduction, unraveling the intrinsic data structure. The real-world data however often come with noises and outliers; seldom, all the data live in a single linear subspace. Inspired by the recent advances in sparse subspace learning and diffusion-based approaches, we propose a new manifold denoising algorithm in which data neighborhoods are adaptively inferred via sparse subspace reconstruction; we then derive a new formulation to perform denoising to the original data. Experiments carried out on both toy and real applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method; it is insensitive to parameter tuning and we show significant improvement over the competing algorithms.</p><p>5 0.63122284 <a title="449-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Stochastic_Deconvolution.html">412 cvpr-2013-Stochastic Deconvolution</a></p>
<p>Author: James Gregson, Felix Heide, Matthias B. Hullin, Mushfiqur Rouf, Wolfgang Heidrich</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel stochastic framework for non-blind deconvolution based on point samples obtained from random walks. Unlike previous methods that must be tailored to specific regularization strategies, the new Stochastic Deconvolution method allows arbitrary priors, including nonconvex and data-dependent regularizers, to be introduced and tested with little effort. Stochastic Deconvolution is straightforward to implement, produces state-of-the-art results and directly leads to a natural boundary condition for image boundaries and saturated pixels.</p><p>6 0.62886643 <a title="449-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_3D_Reconstruction_from_Severely_Blurred_Images_Using_a_Single_Moving_Camera.html">108 cvpr-2013-Dense 3D Reconstruction from Severely Blurred Images Using a Single Moving Camera</a></p>

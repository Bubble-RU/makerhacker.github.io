</p><p>6 Introduction There is an increasing interest in developing new event recognition techniques for searching and indexing the explosively growing consumer videos. [sent-16, score-0.405]
</p><p>7 However, visual event recognition in consumer videos is a challenging task because of cluttered backgrounds, complex camera motion and large intra-class variations. [sent-17, score-0.554]
</p><p>8 In these works, a sufficient labeled training videos are required to learn robust classifiers for event recognition. [sent-23, score-0.438]
</p><p>9 Observing that keyword (or tag) based search can be readily used to collect a large number ofrelevant web images or web videos without human annotation [9], researchers recently proposed new approaches that exploit the rich and massive  web data for the event recognition task. [sent-25, score-0.988]

</p><p>13 Motivated by [7, 9], we formulate this task as a new multi-domain adaptation problem with heterogeneous sources, in which samples from different source domains can be represented by different types of features with different dimensions (e. [sent-39, score-1.168]
</p><p>14 , SIFT features from web images and Space-time (ST) features from web videos1) while the 1For the ease of representation, we assume the samples from each source domain are only represented by one type of feature in this work. [sent-41, score-1.214]

</p><p>16 Observing that some source domains are more relevant to the target domain, in Section 3, we propose a new method called Multi-domain Adaptation with Heterogeneous Sources (MDA-HS) to effectively cope with heterogeneous sources. [sent-43, score-1.126]
</p><p>17 Specifically, we seek the optimal weights for different source domains with different types of features and also infer the labels of unlabeled target domain data based on all types of features. [sent-44, score-1.364]
</p><p>18 For each source domain, we propose to learn an adapted classifier based on the pre-learnt source classifier with data distribution mismatch, for which we minimize the distance between the two classifiers in terms of their weight vectors. [sent-45, score-0.82]
</p><p>19 We introduce a new regularizer by summing the weighted distances from all the source domains and combine all the weighted adapted classifiers as a new target classifier. [sent-46, score-0.921]
</p><p>20 We also propose a new œÅ-SVM based objective function by using the new regularizer and target classifier for domain adaptation. [sent-47, score-0.753]
</p><p>21 In Section 4, we conduct comprehensive experiments using two benchmark consumer video datasets as the target domain, and the results demonstrate that our method MDA-HS outperforms the existing multi-domain adaptation methods for event recognition. [sent-49, score-0.998]
</p><p>22 Related Work Recently, domain adaptation has attracted increasing attention in computer vision because of its successful applications in object recognition [12, 13, 14, 20, 26], event recognition [7, 9] and video concept detection [8]. [sent-51, score-0.828]
</p><p>23 [13] proposed new domain adaptation methods by interpolating new subspaces to bridge the two domains. [sent-59, score-0.619]
</p><p>24 Multi-domain adaptation methods [9, 15, 10, 5, 27, 28] were also proposed when training data come from multiple source domains. [sent-60, score-0.583]
</p><p>25 [9] proposed a domain selection method to select the most relevant source domains. [sent-62, score-0.715]
</p><p>26 proposed a two-step approach to first learn the weight for each source domain and then learn the target classifier by using the learnt source domain weights. [sent-66, score-1.791]
</p><p>27 However, most existing multi-domain adaptation methods assume allthe training samples from the source and target domains be treated as two source domains, in which different features from the same set of samples. [sent-67, score-1.459]
</p><p>28 The source domain data contain both web images from Google/Bing and web videos from YouTube. [sent-126, score-1.261]
</p><p>29 Therefore, they cannot effectively handle our setting with labeled singleview data from heterogeneous source domains and unlabeled multi-view data from the target domain. [sent-129, score-1.205]
</p><p>30 In contrast, our work, MDA-HS, can simultaneously learn the optimal target classifier and seek the optimal weights for different source domains with different types of features. [sent-131, score-0.949]
</p><p>31 Our work is also different from heterogeneous domain adaption (HDA) methods [20, 11], in which the samples from the source and the target domains are represented by different types of features. [sent-132, score-1.506]
</p><p>32 In contrary, in our work the samples from each pair of source and target domains share the same type of feature because we assume the target domain samples are represented by all types offeatures. [sent-133, score-1.561]
</p><p>33 In the existing HDA methods [20, 11], labeled target domain samples must be provided. [sent-134, score-0.724]
</p><p>34 In contrast, we do not require any labeled target domain samples. [sent-135, score-0.676]
</p><p>35 Our work is also different from existing multi-view learning approaches including multi-view based domain adaptation methods [33, 6]. [sent-136, score-0.619]
</p><p>36 These works [33, 6] generally assume all the data in the source and target domains have multiple types of features, which is different from our setting (see Fig. [sent-137, score-0.866]

<p>Author: Jeff Donahue, Judy Hoffman, Erik Rodner, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Most successful object classification and detection methods rely on classifiers trained on large labeled datasets. However, for domains where labels are limited, simply borrowing labeled data from existing datasets can hurt performance, a phenomenon known as ‚Äúdataset bias.‚Äù We propose a general framework for adapting classifiers from ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù data to the target domain using a combination of available labeled and unlabeled examples. Specifically, we show that imposing smoothness constraints on the classifier scores over the unlabeled data can lead to improved adaptation results.

<p>Author: Sumit Shekhar, Vishal M. Patel, Hien V. Nguyen, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: Data-driven dictionaries have produced state-of-the-art results in various classification tasks. However, when the target data has a different distribution than the source data, the learned sparse representation may not be optimal. In this paper, we investigate if it is possible to optimally represent both source and target by a common dictionary. Specifically, we describe a technique which jointly learns projections of data in the two domains, and a latent dictionary which can succinctly represent both the domains in the projected low-dimensional space. An efficient optimization technique is presented, which can be easily kernelized and extended to multiple domains. The algorithm is modified to learn a common discriminative dictionary, which can be further used for classification. The proposed approach does not require any explicit correspondence between the source and target domains, and shows good results even when there are only a few labels available in the target domain. Various recognition experiments show that the methodperforms onparor better than competitive stateof-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.22553833 <a title="150-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-From_N_to_N%2B1%3A_Multiclass_Transfer_Incremental_Learning.html">179 cvpr-2013-From N to N+1: Multiclass Transfer Incremental Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ilja Kuzborskij, Francesco Orabona, Barbara Caputo</p><p>Abstract: Since the seminal work of Thrun [17], the learning to learnparadigm has been defined as the ability ofan agent to improve its performance at each task with experience, with the number of tasks. Within the object categorization domain, the visual learning community has actively declined this paradigm in the transfer learning setting. Almost all proposed methods focus on category detection problems, addressing how to learn a new target class from few samples by leveraging over the known source. But if one thinks oflearning over multiple tasks, there is a needfor multiclass transfer learning algorithms able to exploit previous source knowledge when learning a new class, while at the same time optimizing their overall performance. This is an open challenge for existing transfer learning algorithms. The contribution of this paper is a discriminative method that addresses this issue, based on a Least-Squares Support Vector Machine formulation. Our approach is designed to balance between transferring to the new class and preserving what has already been learned on the source models. Exten- sive experiments on subsets of publicly available datasets prove the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>6 0.17221385 <a title="150-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Cross-Domain_Information_Transfer_for_Location_Recognition_and_Clustering.html">250 cvpr-2013-Learning Cross-Domain Information Transfer for Location Recognition and Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Lin Chen, Lixin Duan, Dong Xu</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we propose to leverage a large number of loosely labeled web videos (e.g., from YouTube) and web images (e.g., from Google/Bing image search) for visual event recognition in consumer videos without requiring any labeled consumer videos. We formulate this task as a new multi-domain adaptation problem with heterogeneous sources, in which the samples from different source domains can be represented by different types of features with different dimensions (e.g., the SIFTfeaturesfrom web images and space-time (ST) features from web videos) while the target domain samples have all types of features. To effectively cope with the heterogeneous sources where some source domains are more relevant to the target domain, we propose a new method called Multi-domain Adaptation with Heterogeneous Sources (MDA-HS) to learn an optimal target classifier, in which we simultaneously seek the optimal weights for different source domains with different types of features as well as infer the labels of unlabeled target domain data based on multiple types of features. We solve our optimization problem by using the cutting-plane algorithm based on group-based multiple kernel learning. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MDA-HS for event recognition in consumer videos.</p><p>2 0.89339715 <a title="150-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised_Domain_Adaptation_with_Instance_Constraints.html">387 cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation with Instance Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhong Zhang, Chunheng Wang, Baihua Xiao, Wen Zhou, Shuang Liu, Cunzhao Shi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for cross-view action recognition via a continuous virtual path which connects the source view and the target view. Each point on this virtual path is a virtual view which is obtained by a linear transformation of the action descriptor. All the virtual views are concatenated into an infinite-dimensional feature to characterize continuous changes from the source to the target view. However, these infinite-dimensional features cannot be used directly. Thus, we propose a virtual view kernel to compute the value of similarity between two infinite-dimensional features, which can be readily used to construct any kernelized classifiers. In addition, there are a lot of unlabeled samples from the target view, which can be utilized to improve the performance of classifiers. Thus, we present a constraint strategy to explore the information contained in the unlabeled samples. The rationality behind the constraint is that any action video belongs to only one class. Our method is verified on the IXMAS dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.53771716 <a title="150-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Generalized_Domain-Adaptive_Dictionaries.html">185 cvpr-2013-Generalized Domain-Adaptive Dictionaries</a></p>

<p>Author: Jia Deng, Jonathan Krause, Li Fei-Fei</p><p>Abstract: Fine-grained recognition concerns categorization at sub-ordinate levels, where the distinction between object classes is highly local. Compared to basic level recognition, fine-grained categorization can be more challenging as there are in general less data and fewer discriminative features. This necessitates the use of stronger prior for feature selection. In this work, we include humans in the loop to help computers select discriminative features. We introduce a novel online game called ‚ÄúBubbles ‚Äù that reveals discriminative features humans use. The player‚Äôs goal is to identify the category of a heavily blurred image. During the game, the player can choose to reveal full details of circular regions ( ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù), with a certain penalty. With proper setup the game generates discriminative bubbles with assured quality. We next propose the ‚ÄúBubbleBank‚Äù algorithm that uses the human selected bubbles to improve machine recognition performance. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields large improvements over the previous state of the art on challenging benchmarks.</p><p>2 0.82221556 <a title="150-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Practical_Rank-Constrained_Eight-Point_Algorithm_for_Fundamental_Matrix_Estimation.html">23 cvpr-2013-A Practical Rank-Constrained Eight-Point Algorithm for Fundamental Matrix Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yinqiang Zheng, Shigeki Sugimoto, Masatoshi Okutomi</p><p>Abstract: Due to its simplicity, the eight-point algorithm has been widely used in fundamental matrix estimation. Unfortunately, the rank-2 constraint of a fundamental matrix is enforced via a posterior rank correction step, thus leading to non-optimal solutions to the original problem. To address this drawback, existing algorithms need to solve either a very high order polynomial or a sequence of convex relaxation problems, both of which are computationally ineffective and numerically unstable. In this work, we present a new rank-2 constrained eight-point algorithm, which directly incorporates the rank-2 constraint in the minimization process. To avoid singularities, we propose to solve seven subproblems and retrieve their globally optimal solutions by using tailored polynomial system solvers. Our proposed method is noniterative, computationally efficient and numerically stable. Experiment results have verified its superiority over existing algebraic error based algorithms in terms of accuracy, as well as its advantages when used to initialize geometric error based algorithms.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.82049048 <a title="150-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Event_Recognition_in_Videos_by_Learning_from_Heterogeneous_Web_Sources.html">150 cvpr-2013-Event Recognition in Videos by Learning from Heterogeneous Web Sources</a></p>

<p>Author: Brian Potetz, Mohammadreza Hajiarbabi</p><p>Abstract: For problems over continuous random variables, MRFs with large cliques pose a challenge in probabilistic inference. Difficulties in performing optimization efficiently have limited the probabilistic models explored in computer vision and other fields. One inference technique that handles large cliques well is Expectation Propagation. EP offers run times independent of clique size, which instead depend only on the rank, or intrinsic dimensionality, of potentials. This property would be highly advantageous in computer vision. Unfortunately, for grid-shaped models common in vision, traditional Gaussian EP requires quadratic space and cubic time in the number of pixels. Here, we propose a variation of EP that exploits regularities in natural scene statistics to achieve run times that are linear in both number of pixels and clique size. We test these methods on shape from shading, and we demonstrate strong performance not only for Lambertian surfaces, but also on arbitrary surface reflectance and lighting arrangements, which requires highly non-Gaussian potentials. Finally, we use large, non-local cliques to exploit cast shadow, which is traditionally ignored in shape from shading.</p><p>5 0.77345574 <a title="150-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Compressed_Hashing.html">87 cvpr-2013-Compressed Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Lin, Rong Jin, Deng Cai, Shuicheng Yan, Xuelong Li</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that hashing methods are effective for high dimensional nearest neighbor search. A common problem shared by many existing hashing methods is that in order to achieve a satisfied performance, a large number of hash tables (i.e., long codewords) are required. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel approach called Compressed Hashing by exploring the techniques of sparse coding and compressed sensing. In particular, we introduce a sparse coding scheme, based on the approximation theory of integral operator, that generate sparse representation for high dimensional vectors. We then project sparse codes into a low dimensional space by effectively exploring the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), a key property in compressed sensing theory. Both of the theoretical analysis and the empirical studies on two large data sets show that the proposed approach is more effective than the state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.</p><p>6 0.76658744 <a title="150-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Collections_of_Part_Models_for_Object_Recognition.html">248 cvpr-2013-Learning Collections of Part Models for Object Recognition</a></p>

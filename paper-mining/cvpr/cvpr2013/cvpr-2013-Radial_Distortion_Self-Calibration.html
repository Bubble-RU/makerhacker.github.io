<p>Author: Nathan Jacobs, Mohammad T. Islam, Scott Workman</p><p>Abstract: We propose cloud motion as a natural scene cue that enables geometric calibration of static outdoor cameras. This work introduces several new methods that use observations of an outdoor scene over days and weeks to estimate radial distortion, focal length and geo-orientation. Cloud-based cues provide strong constraints and are an important alternative to methods that require specific forms of static scene geometry or clear sky conditions. Our method makes simple assumptions about cloud motion and builds upon previous work on motion-based and line-based calibration. We show results on real scenes that highlight the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p><p>3 0.23928805 <a title="344-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Monocular_Epipolar_Flow_Estimation.html">362 cvpr-2013-Robust Monocular Epipolar Flow Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Koichiro Yamaguchi, David McAllester, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of computing optical flow in monocular video taken from a moving vehicle. In this setting, the vast majority of image flow is due to the vehicle ’s ego-motion. We propose to take advantage of this fact and estimate flow along the epipolar lines of the egomotion. Towards this goal, we derive a slanted-plane MRF model which explicitly reasons about the ordering of planes and their physical validity at junctions. Furthermore, we present a bottom-up grouping algorithm which produces over-segmentations that respect flow boundaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the challenging KITTI flow benchmark [11] achieving half the error of the best competing general flow algorithm and one third of the error of the best epipolar flow algorithm.</p><p>4 0.19374669 <a title="344-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_without_Human_Scores_for_Blind_Image_Quality_Assessment.html">266 cvpr-2013-Learning without Human Scores for Blind Image Quality Assessment</a></p>
<p>Author: Wufeng Xue, Lei Zhang, Xuanqin Mou</p><p>Abstract: General purpose blind image quality assessment (BIQA) has been recently attracting significant attention in thefields of image processing, vision and machine learning. Stateof-the-art BIQA methods usually learn to evaluate the image quality by regression from human subjective scores of the training samples. However, these methods need a large number of human scored images for training, and lack an explicit explanation of how the image quality is affected by image local features. An interesting question is then: can we learn for effective BIQA without using human scored images? This paper makes a good effort to answer this question. We partition the distorted images into overlapped patches, and use a percentile pooling strategy to estimate the local quality of each patch. Then a quality-aware clustering (QAC) method is proposed to learn a set of centroids on each quality level. These centroids are then used as a codebook to infer the quality of each patch in a given image, and subsequently a perceptual quality score of the whole image can be obtained. The proposed QAC based BIQA method is simple yet effective. It not only has comparable accuracy to those methods using human scored images in learning, but also has merits such as high linearity to human perception of image quality, real-time implementation and availability of image local quality map.</p><p>5 0.18972886 <a title="344-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Optimized_Product_Quantization_for_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_Search.html">319 cvpr-2013-Optimized Product Quantization for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Tiezheng Ge, Kaiming He, Qifa Ke, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: Product quantization is an effective vector quantization approach to compactly encode high-dimensional vectors for fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. The essence of product quantization is to decompose the original high-dimensional space into the Cartesian product of a finite number of low-dimensional subspaces that are then quantized separately. Optimal space decomposition is important for the performance of ANN search, but still remains unaddressed. In this paper, we optimize product quantization by minimizing quantization distortions w.r.t. the space decomposition and the quantization codebooks. We present two novel methods for optimization: a nonparametric method that alternatively solves two smaller sub-problems, and a parametric method that is guaranteed to achieve the optimal solution if the input data follows some Gaussian distribution. We show by experiments that our optimized approach substantially improves the accuracy of product quantization for ANN search.</p><p>6 0.18372752 <a title="344-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Decoding%2C_Calibration_and_Rectification_for_Lenselet-Based_Plenoptic_Cameras.html">102 cvpr-2013-Decoding, Calibration and Rectification for Lenselet-Based Plenoptic Cameras</a></p>

<p>Author: Donald G. Dansereau, Oscar Pizarro, Stefan B. Williams</p><p>Abstract: Plenoptic cameras are gaining attention for their unique light gathering and post-capture processing capabilities. We describe a decoding, calibration and rectification procedurefor lenselet-basedplenoptic cameras appropriatefor a range of computer vision applications. We derive a novel physically based 4D intrinsic matrix relating each recorded pixel to its corresponding ray in 3D space. We further propose a radial distortion model and a practical objective function based on ray reprojection. Our 15-parameter camera model is of much lower dimensionality than camera array models, and more closely represents the physics of lenselet-based cameras. Results include calibration of a commercially available camera using three calibration grid sizes over five datasets. Typical RMS ray reprojection errors are 0.0628, 0.105 and 0.363 mm for 3.61, 7.22 and 35.1 mm calibration grids, respectively. Rectification examples include calibration targets and real-world imagery.</p><p>3 0.66414338 <a title="344-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Principal_Observation_Ray_Calibration_for_Tiled-Lens-Array_Integral_Imaging_Display.html">337 cvpr-2013-Principal Observation Ray Calibration for Tiled-Lens-Array Integral Imaging Display</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiming Li, Haitao Wang, Mingcai Zhou, Shandong Wang, Shaohui Jiao, Xing Mei, Tao Hong, Hoyoung Lee, Jiyeun Kim</p><p>Abstract: Integral imaging display (IID) is a promising technology to provide realistic 3D image without glasses. To achieve a large screen IID with a reasonable fabrication cost, a potential solution is a tiled-lens-array IID (TLA-IID). However, TLA-IIDs are subject to 3D image artifacts when there are even slight misalignments between the lens arrays. This work aims at compensating these artifacts by calibrating the lens array poses with a camera and including them in a ray model used for rendering the 3D image. Since the lens arrays are transparent, this task is challenging for traditional calibration methods. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration method based on defining a set of principle observation rays that pass lens centers of the TLA and the camera ’s optical center. The method is able to determine the lens array poses with only one camera at an arbitrary unknown position without using any additional markers. The principle observation rays are automatically extracted using a structured light based method from a dense correspondence map between the displayed and captured . pixels. . com, Experiments show that lens array misalignments xme i nlpr . ia . ac . cn @ can be estimated with a standard deviation smaller than 0.4 pixels. Based on this, 3D image artifacts are shown to be effectively removed in a test TLA-IID with challenging misalignments.</p><p>4 0.63993728 <a title="344-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Manhattan_Scene_Understanding_via_XSlit_Imaging.html">279 cvpr-2013-Manhattan Scene Understanding via XSlit Imaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinwei Ye, Yu Ji, Jingyi Yu</p><p>Abstract: A Manhattan World (MW) [3] is composed of planar surfaces and parallel lines aligned with three mutually orthogonal principal axes. Traditional MW understanding algorithms rely on geometry priors such as the vanishing points and reference (ground) planes for grouping coplanar structures. In this paper, we present a novel single-image MW reconstruction algorithm from the perspective of nonpinhole cameras. We show that by acquiring the MW using an XSlit camera, we can instantly resolve coplanarity ambiguities. Specifically, we prove that parallel 3D lines map to 2D curves in an XSlit image and they converge at an XSlit Vanishing Point (XVP). In addition, if the lines are coplanar, their curved images will intersect at a second common pixel that we call Coplanar Common Point (CCP). CCP is a unique image feature in XSlit cameras that does not exist in pinholes. We present a comprehensive theory to analyze XVPs and CCPs in a MW scene and study how to recover 3D geometry in a complex MW scene from XVPs and CCPs. Finally, we build a prototype XSlit camera by using two layers of cylindrical lenses. Experimental results × on both synthetic and real data show that our new XSlitcamera-based solution provides an effective and reliable solution for MW understanding.</p><p>5 0.63330841 <a title="344-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Cloud_Motion_as_a_Calibration_Cue.html">84 cvpr-2013-Cloud Motion as a Calibration Cue</a></p>

<p>Author: Zihan Zhou, Hailin Jin, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Recently, a new image deformation technique called content-preserving warping (CPW) has been successfully employed to produce the state-of-the-art video stabilization results in many challenging cases. The key insight of CPW is that the true image deformation due to viewpoint change can be well approximated by a carefully constructed warp using a set of sparsely constructed 3D points only. However, since CPW solely relies on the tracked feature points to guide the warping, it works poorly in large textureless regions, such as ground and building interiors. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we present a hybrid approach for novel view synthesis, observing that the textureless regions often correspond to large planar surfaces in the scene. Particularly, given a jittery video, we first segment each frame into piecewise planar regions as well as regions labeled as non-planar using Markov random fields. Then, a new warp is computed by estimating a single homography for regions belong to the same plane, while in- heriting results from CPW in the non-planar regions. We demonstrate how the segmentation information can be efficiently obtained and seamlessly integrated into the stabilization framework. Experimental results on a variety of real video sequences verify the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>3 0.9359675 <a title="344-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Underwater_Camera_Calibration_Using_Wavelength_Triangulation.html">447 cvpr-2013-Underwater Camera Calibration Using Wavelength Triangulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Timothy Yau, Minglun Gong, Yee-Hong Yang</p><p>Abstract: In underwater imagery, the image formation process includes refractions that occur when light passes from water into the camera housing, typically through a flat glass port. We extend the existing work on physical refraction models by considering the dispersion of light, and derive new constraints on the model parameters for use in calibration. This leads to a novel calibration method that achieves improved accuracy compared to existing work. We describe how to construct a novel calibration device for our method and evaluate the accuracy of the method through synthetic and real experiments.</p><p>4 0.93129659 <a title="344-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Shading-Based_Shape_Refinement_of_RGB-D_Images.html">394 cvpr-2013-Shading-Based Shape Refinement of RGB-D Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Lap-Fai Yu, Sai-Kit Yeung, Yu-Wing Tai, Stephen Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present a shading-based shape refinement algorithm which uses a noisy, incomplete depth map from Kinect to help resolve ambiguities in shape-from-shading. In our framework, the partial depth information is used to overcome bas-relief ambiguity in normals estimation, as well as to assist in recovering relative albedos, which are needed to reliably estimate the lighting environment and to separate shading from albedo. This refinement of surface normals using a noisy depth map leads to high-quality 3D surfaces. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through several challenging real-world examples.</p><p>5 0.92936522 <a title="344-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Beyond_Point_Clouds%3A_Scene_Understanding_by_Reasoning_Geometry_and_Physics.html">61 cvpr-2013-Beyond Point Clouds: Scene Understanding by Reasoning Geometry and Physics</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Zheng, Yibiao Zhao, Joey C. Yu, Katsushi Ikeuchi, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for scene understanding by reasoning physical stability of objects from point cloud. We utilize a simple observation that, by human design, objects in static scenes should be stable with respect to gravity. This assumption is applicable to all scene categories and poses useful constraints for the plausible interpretations (parses) in scene understanding. Our method consists of two major steps: 1) geometric reasoning: recovering solid 3D volumetric primitives from defective point cloud; and 2) physical reasoning: grouping the unstable primitives to physically stable objects by optimizing the stability and the scene prior. We propose to use a novel disconnectivity graph (DG) to represent the energy landscape and use a Swendsen-Wang Cut (MCMC) method for optimization. In experiments, we demonstrate that the algorithm achieves substantially better performance for i) object segmentation, ii) 3D volumetric recovery of the scene, and iii) better parsing result for scene understanding in comparison to state-of-the-art methods in both public dataset and our own new dataset.</p><p>6 0.92861962 <a title="344-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Brain_Effective_Connectivity_Analysis_for_Alzheimer%27s_Disease%3A_A_Kernel_Learning_Approach_upon_Sparse_Gaussian_Bayesian_Network.html">129 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Brain Effective Connectivity Analysis for Alzheimer's Disease: A Kernel Learning Approach upon Sparse Gaussian Bayesian Network</a></p>

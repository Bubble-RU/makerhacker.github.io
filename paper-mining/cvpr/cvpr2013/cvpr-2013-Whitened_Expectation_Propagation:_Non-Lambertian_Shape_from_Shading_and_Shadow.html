<p>Author: Lap-Fai Yu, Sai-Kit Yeung, Yu-Wing Tai, Stephen Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present a shading-based shape refinement algorithm which uses a noisy, incomplete depth map from Kinect to help resolve ambiguities in shape-from-shading. In our framework, the partial depth information is used to overcome bas-relief ambiguity in normals estimation, as well as to assist in recovering relative albedos, which are needed to reliably estimate the lighting environment and to separate shading from albedo. This refinement of surface normals using a noisy depth map leads to high-quality 3D surfaces. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through several challenging real-world examples.</p><p>3 0.1907066 <a title="466-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Nonlinearly_Constrained_MRFs%3A_Exploring_the_Intrinsic_Dimensions_of_Higher-Order_Cliques.html">308 cvpr-2013-Nonlinearly Constrained MRFs: Exploring the Intrinsic Dimensions of Higher-Order Cliques</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Stefano Soatto, Shing-Tung Yau</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient approach to integrating non-local statistics into the higher-order Markov Random Fields (MRFs) framework. Motivated by the observation that many non-local statistics (e.g., shape priors, color distributions) can usually be represented by a small number of parameters, we reformulate the higher-order MRF model by introducing additional latent variables to represent the intrinsic dimensions of the higher-order cliques. The resulting new model, called NC-MRF, not only provides the flexibility in representing the configurations of higher-order cliques, but also automatically decomposes the energy function into less coupled terms, allowing us to design an efficient algorithmic framework for maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Based on this novel modeling/inference framework, we achieve state-of-the-art solutions to the challenging problems of class-specific image segmentation and template-based 3D facial expression tracking, which demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>4 0.18199742 <a title="466-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Higher-Order_CRF_Model_for_Road_Network_Extraction.html">13 cvpr-2013-A Higher-Order CRF Model for Road Network Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan D. Wegner, Javier A. Montoya-Zegarra, Konrad Schindler</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to extract the road network from aerial images. What makes the problem challenging is the complex structure of the prior: roads form a connected network of smooth, thin segments which meet at junctions and crossings. This type of a-priori knowledge is more difficult to turn into a tractable model than standard smoothness or co-occurrence assumptions. We develop a novel CRF formulation for road labeling, in which the prior is represented by higher-order cliques that connect sets of superpixels along straight line segments. These long-range cliques have asymmetric PN-potentials, which express a preference to assign all rather than just some of their constituent superpixels to the road class. Thus, the road likelihood is amplified for thin chains of superpixels, while the CRF is still amenable to optimization with graph cuts. Since the number of such cliques of arbitrary length is huge, we furthermorepropose a sampling scheme which concentrates on those cliques which are most relevant for the optimization. In experiments on two different databases the model significantly improves both the per-pixel accuracy and the topological correctness of the extracted roads, and outper- forms both a simple smoothness prior and heuristic rulebased road completion.</p><p>5 0.1393214 <a title="466-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-The_Episolar_Constraint%3A_Monocular_Shape_from_Shadow_Correspondence.html">428 cvpr-2013-The Episolar Constraint: Monocular Shape from Shadow Correspondence</a></p>
<p>Author: Austin Abrams, Kylia Miskell, Robert Pless</p><p>Abstract: Shadows encode a powerful geometric cue: if one pixel casts a shadow onto another, then the two pixels are colinear with the lighting direction. Given many images over many lighting directions, this constraint can be leveraged to recover the depth of a scene from a single viewpoint. For outdoor scenes with solar illumination, we term this the episolar constraint, which provides a convex optimization to solve for the sparse depth of a scene from shadow correspondences, a method to reduce the search space when finding shadow correspondences, and a method to geometrically calibrate a camera using shadow constraints. Our method constructs a dense network of nonlocal constraints which complements recent work on outdoor photometric stereo and cloud based cues for 3D. We demonstrate results across a variety of time-lapse sequences from webcams “in . wu st l. edu (b)(c) the wild.”</p><p>6 0.13333103 <a title="466-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-parametric_Filtering_for_Geometric_Detail_Extraction_and_Material_Representation.html">305 cvpr-2013-Non-parametric Filtering for Geometric Detail Extraction and Material Representation</a></p>

It is an important component in object modeling, but not accounted for in current intrinsic image works.

<p>Author: Daniel Hauagge, Scott Wehrwein, Kavita Bala, Noah Snavely</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for computing ambient occlusion (AO) for a stack of images of a scene from a fixed viewpoint. Ambient occlusion, a concept common in computer graphics, characterizes the local visibility at a point: it approximates how much light can reach that point from different directions without getting blocked by other geometry. While AO has received surprisingly little attention in vision, we show that it can be approximated using simple, per-pixel statistics over image stacks, based on a simplified image formation model. We use our derived AO measure to compute reflectance and illumination for objects without relying on additional smoothness priors, and demonstrate state-of-the art performance on the MIT Intrinsic Images benchmark. We also demonstrate our method on several synthetic and real scenes, including 3D printed objects with known ground truth geometry.</p><p>4 0.64870948 <a title="466-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Bayesian_Depth-from-Defocus_with_Shading_Constraints.html">56 cvpr-2013-Bayesian Depth-from-Defocus with Shading Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Chen Li, Shuochen Su, Yasuyuki Matsushita, Kun Zhou, Stephen Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present a method that enhances the performance of depth-from-defocus (DFD) through the use of shading information. DFD suffers from important limitations namely coarse shape reconstruction and poor accuracy on textureless surfaces that can be overcome with the help of shading. We integrate both forms of data within a Bayesian framework that capitalizes on their relative strengths. Shading data, however, is challenging to recover accurately from surfaces that contain texture. To address this issue, we propose an iterative technique that utilizes depth information to improve shading estimation, which in turn is used to elevate depth estimation in the presence of textures. With this approach, we demonstrate improvements over existing DFD techniques, as well as effective shape reconstruction of textureless surfaces. – –</p><p>5 0.5994128 <a title="466-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Boundary_Cues_for_3D_Object_Shape_Recovery.html">71 cvpr-2013-Boundary Cues for 3D Object Shape Recovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Karsch, Zicheng Liao, Jason Rock, Jonathan T. Barron, Derek Hoiem</p><p>Abstract: Early work in computer vision considered a host of geometric cues for both shape reconstruction [11] and recognition [14]. However, since then, the vision community has focused heavily on shading cues for reconstruction [1], and moved towards data-driven approaches for recognition [6]. In this paper, we reconsider these perhaps overlooked “boundary” cues (such as self occlusions and folds in a surface), as well as many other established constraints for shape reconstruction. In a variety of user studies and quantitative tasks, we evaluate how well these cues inform shape reconstruction (relative to each other) in terms of both shape quality and shape recognition. Our findings suggest many new directions for future research in shape reconstruction, such as automatic boundary cue detection and relaxing assumptions in shape from shading (e.g. orthographic projection, Lambertian surfaces).</p><p>6 0.59824383 <a title="466-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_New_Perspective_on_Uncalibrated_Photometric_Stereo.html">21 cvpr-2013-A New Perspective on Uncalibrated Photometric Stereo</a></p>

<p>Author: Jing Yuan, Wu Qiu, Eranga Ukwatta, Martin Rajchl, Xue-Cheng Tai, Aaron Fenster</p><p>Abstract: Segmenting 3D endfiring transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate images efficiently and accurately is of utmost importance for the planning and guiding 3D TRUS guided prostate biopsy. Poor image quality and imaging artifacts of 3D TRUS images often introduce a challenging task in computation to directly extract the 3D prostate surface. In this work, we propose a novel global optimization approach to delineate 3D prostate boundaries using its rotational resliced images around a specified axis, which properly enforces the inherent rotational symmetry of prostate shapes to jointly adjust a series of 2D slicewise segmentations in the global 3D sense. We show that the introduced challenging combinatorial optimization problem can be solved globally and exactly by means of convex relaxation. In this regard, we propose a novel coupled continuous max-flow model, which not only provides a powerful mathematical tool to analyze the proposed optimization problem but also amounts to a new and efficient duality-basedalgorithm. Ex- tensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-art methods in terms ofefficiency, accuracy, reliability and less user-interactions, and reduces the execution time by a factor of 100.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.85315949 <a title="466-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Whitened_Expectation_Propagation%3A_Non-Lambertian_Shape_from_Shading_and_Shadow.html">466 cvpr-2013-Whitened Expectation Propagation: Non-Lambertian Shape from Shading and Shadow</a></p>

EP offers run times independent of clique size, which instead depend only on the rank, or intrinsic dimensionality, of potentials. This property would be highly advantageous in computer vision. Unfortunately, for grid-shaped models common in vision, traditional Gaussian EP requires quadratic space and cubic time in the number of pixels. Here, we propose a variation of EP that exploits regularities in natural scene statistics to achieve run times that are linear in both number of pixels and clique size. We test these methods on shape from shading, and we demonstrate strong performance not only for Lambertian surfaces, but also on arbitrary surface reflectance and lighting arrangements, which requires highly non-Gaussian potentials. Finally, we use large, non-local cliques to exploit cast shadow, which is traditionally ignored in shape from shading.</p><p>3 0.8209219 <a title="466-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Minimum_Uncertainty_Gap_for_Robust_Visual_Tracking.html">285 cvpr-2013-Minimum Uncertainty Gap for Robust Visual Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Junseok Kwon, Kyoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel tracking algorithm that robustly tracks the target by finding the state which minimizes uncertainty of the likelihood at current state. The uncertainty of the likelihood is estimated by obtaining the gap between the lower and upper bounds of the likelihood. By minimizing the gap between the two bounds, our method finds the confident and reliable state of the target. In the paper, the state that gives the Minimum Uncertainty Gap (MUG) between likelihood bounds is shown to be more reliable than the state which gives the maximum likelihood only, especially when there are severe illumination changes, occlusions, and pose variations. A rigorous derivation of the lower and upper bounds of the likelihood for the visual tracking problem is provided to address this issue. Additionally, an efficient inference algorithm using Interacting Markov Chain Monte Carlo is presented to find the best state that maximizes the average of the lower and upper bounds of the likelihood and minimizes the gap between two bounds simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully tracks the target in realistic videos and outperforms conventional tracking methods.</p><p>4 0.81725746 <a title="466-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Unsupervised_Salience_Learning_for_Person_Re-identification.html">451 cvpr-2013-Unsupervised Salience Learning for Person Re-identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Zhao, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Human eyes can recognize person identities based on some small salient regions. However, such valuable salient information is often hidden when computing similarities of images with existing approaches. Moreover, many existing approaches learn discriminative features and handle drastic viewpoint change in a supervised way and require labeling new training data for a different pair of camera views. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective for person re-identification based on unsupervised salience learning. Distinctive features are extracted without requiring identity labels in the training procedure. First, we apply adjacency constrained patch matching to build dense correspondence between image pairs, which shows effectiveness in handling misalignment caused by large viewpoint and pose variations. Second, we learn human salience in an unsupervised manner. To improve the performance of person re-identification, human salience is incorporated in patch matching to find reliable and discriminative matched patches. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on the widely used VIPeR dataset and ETHZ dataset.</p><p>5 0.81435502 <a title="466-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Deformable_Graph_Matching.html">106 cvpr-2013-Deformable Graph Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Feng Zhou, Fernando De_la_Torre</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching (GM) is a fundamental problem in computer science, and it has been successfully applied to many problems in computer vision. Although widely used, existing GM algorithms cannot incorporate global consistence among nodes, which is a natural constraint in computer vision problems. This paper proposes deformable graph matching (DGM), an extension of GM for matching graphs subject to global rigid and non-rigid geometric constraints. The key idea of this work is a new factorization of the pair-wise affinity matrix. This factorization decouples the affinity matrix into the local structure of each graph and the pair-wise affinity edges. Besides the ability to incorporate global geometric transformations, this factorization offers three more benefits. First, there is no need to compute the costly (in space and time) pair-wise affinity matrix. Second, it provides a unified view of many GM methods and extends the standard iterative closest point algorithm. Third, it allows to use the path-following optimization algorithm that leads to improved optimization strategies and matching performance. Experimental results on synthetic and real databases illustrate how DGM outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for GM.

</p><p>3 Based on the positive experimental results, we hope to foster further research on the promising topic ofscale invariant analysis through the wave equation. [sent-10, score-0.608]
</p><p>4 The most popular is certainly the heat or diffusion equation, but other non-linear second-order [16], fourthorder [12] and, very recently, fractional-order PDEs [3] have been deployed for image processing. [sent-15, score-0.159]
</p><p>5 Although the great majority of these equations are parabolic, researchers are also investigating on the use of hyperbolic equations, such as the shock-filters [15] or the telegrapher equation [17]. [sent-16, score-0.133]
</p><p>6 The scale–space theory was developed in seminal works by Witkin [24] and Koenderink  (a)  (b)  (c)  (d)  Figure 1: (a-b) keypoints by our algorithm; (c-d) keypoints by DoG [10]. [sent-18, score-0.436]
</p><p>7 Symmetries are more likely than blobs to appear in untextured objects (a-c): only a few DoG keypoints actually lay on the object. [sent-19, score-0.453]
</p><p>8 On the other hand, a similar number of keypoints is detected on textured surfaces (b-d): yet, the proposed keypoints concentrate on more evident (i. [sent-20, score-0.514]
</p><p>9 Instead, in work dating back to the 90’s [6, 4, 19], the wave equation was used for skeletonization of binary silhouettes and detection of circular objects, due to its ability of eliciting the symmetry set. [sent-26, score-0.831]
</p><p>10 More recently, PDEs other than the  heat equation have been used for description of global silhouettes [21]. [sent-27, score-0.148]
</p><p>11 In particular, we focus on the problem of keypoints detection and advocate the use of the wave equation. [sent-29, score-0.802]
</p><p>12 When applied to images, the wave equation exhibits the ability to highlight symmetries at different scales. [sent-30, score-0.861]
</p><p>13 Salient symmetries are likely to be found in a large range of images, and in particular in those related to man-made untextured objects (Fig. [sent-31, score-0.423]
</p><p>14 Nevertheless, many salient symmetries arise in textured objects alike (Fig. [sent-33, score-0.309]
</p><p>15 Thus, the proposed approach qualifies as a general tool for repeatable salient regions detection. [sent-35, score-0.18]
</p><p>16 Surprisingly, there has been relatively little work on the use of symmetry as a cue to detect and describe local features. [sent-36, score-0.153]
</p><p>17 The most recent contribution on this topic is due to Haugge et Snavely [7], who propose a detector-descriptor pair relying on a local symmetry score computed densely on the image and across scales. [sent-37, score-0.123]
</p><p>18 Unlike our proposal, though, their formalization of symmetry is specifically engineered to capture effectively the salient regions likely to be found in architectural images and relies on the classic Gaussian scale–space rather than our novel formulation grounded on  the wave PDE. [sent-38, score-0.749]
</p><p>19 Earlier related works such as [18, 11] focus on detecting interest points featuring radial symmetries (e. [sent-39, score-0.215]
</p><p>20 The wave equation The wave equation is a well-known linear second-order hyperbolic partial differential equation. [sent-43, score-1.334]
</p><p>21 The boundary conditions, defined by the fourth equation, represent the first order highly absorbing local approximation of the perfectly absorbing boundary conditions [5], which are inherently non-local in space and time, i. [sent-50, score-0.255]
</p><p>22 Absorbing boundary conditions have been chosen to avoid reflections of waves at image boundaries, that would cause unwanted interferences. [sent-53, score-0.162]

</p><p>29 Wave–based  scale analysis  The evolution of image intensities obtained through the wave equation (1) allows for multi–scale signal analysis. [sent-125, score-0.764]
</p><p>30 In particular, as shown in [6], by simulating wave propagation on images it is possible to detect circles of varying radii. [sent-126, score-0.68]

</p><p>34 Therefore, the wave propagation attains an extremum at the center of the circle at a time that is proportional to the scale of the original circle. [sent-138, score-0.926]
</p><p>35 Detection of circle centers is actually a particular case of the more general property of wave propagation of eliciting the symmetry set of curves [19]. [sent-141, score-0.887]
</p><p>36 The symmetry set is defined as the locus of centers of circles bi-tangent to a curve and can be detected by summing u(x, y; t) over t into an accumulator and inserting at each iteration the local spatial extrema of the accumulator into the set. [sent-142, score-0.513]
</p><p>37 To define repeatable keypoints, only the points of locally maximal symmetry must be considered, which correspond to the shock  ? [sent-144, score-0.306]

</p><p>41 Indeed, one interesting future work is the theoretical investigation on the definition of a sound scale–space theory from the wave equation. [sent-167, score-0.61]
</p><p>42 Unfortunately, discretization of the wave propagation is prone to quite significant numerical errors, mainly due to numerical (or grid) dispersion [23]. [sent-168, score-0.903]
</p><p>43 To overcome such issues, we adopt a solution similar to that proposed in [19]: we interleave a wave prop-  agation step to a linear diffusion step governed by the heat equation with diffusivity k ∈ R+, ut(x, y; t) = k∇2u? [sent-171, score-0.812]
</p><p>44 images: in the considered example, three extrema show up, two corresponding to the symmetries arising at the center of the square-like structures formed by the sides of the rectangle and one corresponding to the center of the rectangle. [sent-227, score-0.478]
</p><p>45 The time of an extremum (xext, yext, text) is related to the scale (the radius) rext of the detected symmetry by the following simple relation:  rext=cΔtexxt=cΔΔtxnext. [sent-228, score-0.444]
</p><p>46 Given such scale covariant extrema in our family of signals, we define as keypoints the sharp local extrema of u(x, y; t). [sent-231, score-0.871]
</p><p>47 Although on the synthetic images showed so far the requirement of sharpness of local extrema is redundant, as all extrema are indeed sharp, in real images, weak (i. [sent-232, score-0.578]
</p><p>48 not repeatable) symmetries may be detected if all local extrema are accepted. [sent-234, score-0.504]
</p><p>49 The extrema (minima) show up at times proportional to the circles radius. [sent-236, score-0.294]
</p><p>50 We define a sharp extremum as one whose value is significantly larger (or smaller) than the average of the values in its temporal neighborhood: |u(xext, yext, text) −¯ u(xext, yext, text)| ≥ θ,  (10)  u¯(xext,yext,text) =t2−1 t1k? [sent-238, score-0.17]
</p><p>51 (11)  Both the neighborhood [t1, t2] and the threshold θ must adapt with scale, as the absolute value at the extrema as well as their smoothness increase with scale (Fig. [sent-240, score-0.374]
</p><p>52 However, spatial neighborhoods are not defined at the edge of the image and the computation of the average is computationally more demanding than over 1-D temporal neighborhoods (efficient schemes, such as integral images or histograms can be, of course, deployed in both cases). [sent-244, score-0.096]
</p><p>53 To limit the influence of clutter and occlusions, we select as end of the neighborhood the extremum itself, t2 = text, so that any texture external to the symmetry does not influence its detection. [sent-248, score-0.351]
</p><p>54 The trend of u(x, y; t) at the center of the circle starts with a plateau and then exhibits a sudden drop toward the extremum: indeed, this would be a discontinuity in the continuous case. [sent-253, score-0.119]
</p><p>55 Therefore, we define the starting point of the neighborhood as the end of the plateau (Fig. [sent-254, score-0.13]
</p><p>56 As the trend deviates more and more from the continuous ideal solution when the scale gets larger, because of the numerical dispersion and the diffusion that we interleave with propagation, we learn a starting point for each scale by regressing the neighborhood of the circle (Fig. [sent-256, score-0.475]
</p><p>57 (13)  As we are interested in detecting weaker, though repeatable, symmetries than a high-contrast circle, the actual value θ used at each scale is defined as a fraction ρ of θmax (rext). [sent-266, score-0.275]
</p><p>58 The domain for searching local extrema must also take into account the peculiarity ofthe discretized wave propagation. [sent-267, score-0.889]
</p><p>59 The most straightforward estimation of local extrema of 3D continuous signals, given their discretized version, is represented by extrema within a 3x3x3 neighborhood in the discrete domain. [sent-268, score-0.619]
</p><p>60 However, in wave propagation time and space discretizations are bound by the constant c, which means, in particular, that it takes cΔ1t discrete time intervals for the wave to travel 1 pixel. [sent-269, score-1.233]
</p><p>61 Therefore, to correctly determine if the wave state at (x, y, t) is a local extremum we have to compare it not only with its 3x3 neighbors at time t − 1 and t + 1, but with all the 3x3 neighbors at time tki ∈e t[t − −− 1c aΔn1td, tt ++ 1c,Δ1 btu]. [sent-270, score-0.721]

</p><p>63 With our choice of Δt and c, we have cΔ1t and, hence, it turns out that we have to perform the search for local extrema in a 3x3x5 neighborhood. [sent-272, score-0.263]

</p><p>76 Moreover, the intuition that symmetries are a powerful and robust cue for finding repeatable keypoints is supported by the large margin in performance between our proposal and previous detectors based on other cues. [sent-335, score-0.688]

</p><p>88 Therefore, we found that with untextured objects keypoints should be localized more accurately, when used with existing descriptors, to reach performance comparable to those attained on planar, highly textured objects. [sent-381, score-0.478]

<p>Author: Mayank Bansal, Kostas Daniilidis</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of matching images with disparate appearance arising from factors like dramatic illumination (day vs. night), age (historic vs. new) and rendering style differences. The lack of local intensity or gradient patterns in these images makes the application of pixellevel descriptors like SIFT infeasible. We propose a novel formulation for detecting and matching persistent features between such images by analyzing the eigen-spectrum of the joint image graph constructed from all the pixels in the two images. We show experimental results of our approach on a public dataset of challenging image pairs and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art.</p><p>3 0.088842601 <a title="240-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-On_a_Link_Between_Kernel_Mean_Maps_and_Fraunhofer_Diffraction%2C_with_an_Application_to_Super-Resolution_Beyond_the_Diffraction_Limit.html">312 cvpr-2013-On a Link Between Kernel Mean Maps and Fraunhofer Diffraction, with an Application to Super-Resolution Beyond the Diffraction Limit</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Harmeling, Michael Hirsch, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We establish a link between Fourier optics and a recent construction from the machine learning community termed the kernel mean map. Using the Fraunhofer approximation, it identifies the kernel with the squared Fourier transform of the aperture. This allows us to use results about the invertibility of the kernel mean map to provide a statement about the invertibility of Fraunhofer diffraction, showing that imaging processes with arbitrarily small apertures can in principle be invertible, i.e., do not lose information, provided the objects to be imaged satisfy a generic condition. A real world experiment shows that we can super-resolve beyond the Rayleigh limit.</p><p>4 0.086079702 <a title="240-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Three-Dimensional_Bilateral_Symmetry_Plane_Estimation_in_the_Phase_Domain.html">432 cvpr-2013-Three-Dimensional Bilateral Symmetry Plane Estimation in the Phase Domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Ramakrishna Kakarala, Prabhu Kaliamoorthi, Vittal Premachandran</p><p>Abstract: We show that bilateral symmetry plane estimation for three-dimensional (3-D) shapes may be carried out accurately, and efficiently, in the spherical harmonic domain. Our methods are valuable for applications where spherical harmonic expansion is already employed, such as 3-D shape registration, morphometry, and retrieval. We show that the presence of bilateral symmetry in the 3-D shape is equivalent to a linear phase structure in the corresponding spherical harmonic coefficients, and provide algorithms for estimating the orientation of the symmetry plane. The benefit of using spherical harmonic phase is that symmetry estimation reduces to matching a compact set of descriptors, without the need to solve a correspondence problem. Our methods work on point clouds as well as large-scale mesh models of 3-D shapes.</p><p>5 0.069519125 <a title="240-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Graph_Matching_with_Anchor_Nodes%3A_A_Learning_Approach.html">192 cvpr-2013-Graph Matching with Anchor Nodes: A Learning Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Hu, Raif M. Rustamov, Leonidas Guibas</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the weighted graph matching problem with partially disclosed correspondences between a number of anchor nodes. Our construction exploits recently introduced node signatures based on graph Laplacians, namely the Laplacian family signature (LFS) on the nodes, and the pairwise heat kernel map on the edges. In this paper, without assuming an explicit form of parametric dependence nor a distance metric between node signatures, we formulate an optimization problem which incorporates the knowledge of anchor nodes. Solving this problem gives us an optimized proximity measure specific to the graphs under consideration. Using this as a first order compatibility term, we then set up an integer quadratic program (IQP) to solve for a near optimal graph matching. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on randomly generated graphs and on two widelyused image sequences, when compared with other existing signature and adjacency matrix based graph matching methods.</p><p>6 0.064954959 <a title="240-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Collections_of_Part_Models_for_Object_Recognition.html">248 cvpr-2013-Learning Collections of Part Models for Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Kolomenkin, Ilan Shimshoni, Ayellet Tal</p><p>Abstract: This paper extends to surfaces the multi-scale approach of edge detection on images. The common practice for detecting curves on surfaces requires the user to first select the scale of the features, apply an appropriate smoothing, and detect the edges on the smoothed surface. This approach suffers from two drawbacks. First, it relies on a hidden assumption that all the features on the surface are of the same scale. Second, manual user intervention is required. In this paper, we propose a general framework for automatically detecting the optimal scale for each point on the surface. We smooth the surface at each point according to this optimal scale and run the curve detection algorithm on the resulting surface. Our multi-scale algorithm solves the two disadvantages of the single-scale approach mentioned above. We demonstrate how to realize our approach on two commonly-used special cases: ridges & valleys and relief edges. In each case, the optimal scale is found in accordance with the mathematical definition of the curve.</p><p>3 0.69233155 <a title="240-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Joint_Spectral_Correspondence_for_Disparate_Image_Matching.html">234 cvpr-2013-Joint Spectral Correspondence for Disparate Image Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: George Leifman, Ayellet Tal</p><p>Abstract: Colorization refers to the process of adding color to black & white images or videos. This paper extends the term to handle surfaces in three dimensions. This is important for applications in which the colors of an object need to be restored and no relevant image exists for texturing it. We focus on surfaces with patterns and propose a novel algorithm for adding colors to these surfaces. The user needs only to scribble a few color strokes on one instance of each pattern, and the system proceeds to automatically colorize the whole surface. For this scheme to work, we address not only the problem of colorization, but also the problem of pattern detection on surfaces.</p><p>6 0.61827379 <a title="240-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Axially_Symmetric_3D_Pots_Configuration_System_Using_Axis_of_Symmetry_and_Break_Curve.html">52 cvpr-2013-Axially Symmetric 3D Pots Configuration System Using Axis of Symmetry and Break Curve</a></p>

<p>Author: Yibiao Zhao, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Indoor functional objects exhibit large view and appearance variations, thus are difficult to be recognized by the traditional appearance-based classification paradigm. In this paper, we present an algorithm to parse indoor images based on two observations: i) The functionality is the most essentialproperty to define an indoor object, e.g. “a chair to sit on ”; ii) The geometry (3D shape) ofan object is designed to serve its function. We formulate the nature of the object function into a stochastic grammar model. This model characterizes a joint distribution over the function-geometryappearance (FGA) hierarchy. The hierarchical structure includes a scene category, , functional groups, , functional objects, functional parts and 3D geometric shapes. We use a simulated annealing MCMC algorithm to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution, i.e. a parse tree. We design four data-driven steps to accelerate the search in the FGA space: i) group the line segments into 3D primitive shapes, ii) assign functional labels to these 3D primitive shapes, iii) fill in missing objects/parts according to the functional labels, and iv) synthesize 2D segmentation maps and verify the current parse tree by the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability. The experimental results on several challenging indoor datasets demonstrate theproposed approach not only significantly widens the scope ofindoor sceneparsing algorithm from the segmentation and the 3D recovery to the functional object recognition, but also yields improved overall performance.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.79499167 <a title="240-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Keypoints_from_Symmetries_by_Wave_Propagation.html">240 cvpr-2013-Keypoints from Symmetries by Wave Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Xi Song, Tianfu Wu, Yunde Jia, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a method of learning reconfigurable And-Or Tree (AOT) models discriminatively from weakly annotated data for object detection. To explore the appearance and geometry space of latent structures effectively, we first quantize the image lattice using an overcomplete set of shape primitives, and then organize them into a directed acyclic And-Or Graph (AOG) by exploiting their compositional relations. We allow overlaps between child nodes when combining them into a parent node, which is equivalent to introducing an appearance Or-node implicitly for the overlapped portion. The learning of an AOT model consists of three components: (i) Unsupervised sub-category learning (i.e., branches of an object Or-node) with the latent structures in AOG being integrated out. (ii) Weaklysupervised part configuration learning (i.e., seeking the globally optimal parse trees in AOG for each sub-category). To search the globally optimal parse tree in AOG efficiently, we propose a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. (iii) Joint appearance and structural parameters training under latent structural SVM framework. In experiments, our method is tested on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2010 detection , benchmarks of 20 object classes and outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.73364371 <a title="240-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Accurate_Localization_of_3D_Objects_from_RGB-D_Data_Using_Segmentation_Hypotheses.html">30 cvpr-2013-Accurate Localization of 3D Objects from RGB-D Data Using Segmentation Hypotheses</a></p>

We evaluate our method using two existing RGB-D datasets.

<p>Author: Akshay Asthana, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Shiyang Cheng, Maja Pantic</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel discriminative regression based approach for the Constrained Local Models (CLMs) framework, referred to as the Discriminative Response Map Fitting (DRMF) method, which shows impressive performance in the generic face fitting scenario. The motivation behind this approach is that, unlike the holistic texture based features used in the discriminative AAM approaches, the response map can be represented by a small set of parameters and these parameters can be very efficiently used for reconstructing unseen response maps. Furthermore, we show that by adopting very simple off-the-shelf regression techniques, it is possible to learn robust functions from response maps to the shape parameters updates. The experiments, conducted on Multi-PIE, XM2VTS and LFPW database, show that the proposed DRMF method outperforms stateof-the-art algorithms for the task of generic face fitting. Moreover, the DRMF method is computationally very efficient and is real-time capable. The current MATLAB implementation takes 1second per image. To facilitate future comparisons, we release the MATLAB code1 and the pretrained models for research purposes.</p><p>6 0.7004382 <a title="240-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Single-Sample_Face_Recognition_with_Image_Corruption_and_Misalignment_via_Sparse_Illumination_Transfer.html">399 cvpr-2013-Single-Sample Face Recognition with Image Corruption and Misalignment via Sparse Illumination Transfer</a></p>

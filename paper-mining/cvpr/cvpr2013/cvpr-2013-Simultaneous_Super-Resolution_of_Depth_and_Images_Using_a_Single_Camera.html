<p>Author: Ju Shen, Sen-Ching S. Cheung</p><p>Abstract: The recent popularity of structured-light depth sensors has enabled many new applications from gesture-based user interface to 3D reconstructions. The quality of the depth measurements of these systems, however, is far from perfect. Some depth values can have significant errors, while others can be missing altogether. The uncertainty in depth measurements among these sensors can significantly degrade the performance of any subsequent vision processing. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model to capture various types of uncertainties in the depth measurement process among structured-light systems. The key to our model is the use of depth layers to account for the differences between foreground objects and background scene, the missing depth value phenomenon, and the correlation between color and depth channels. The depth layer labeling is solved as a maximum a-posteriori estimation problem, and a Markov Random Field attuned to the uncertainty in measurements is used to spatially smooth the labeling process. Using the depth-layer labels, we propose a depth correction and completion algorithm that outperforms oth- er techniques in the literature.</p><p>3 0.33422762 <a title="397-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_3D_Reconstruction_from_Severely_Blurred_Images_Using_a_Single_Moving_Camera.html">108 cvpr-2013-Dense 3D Reconstruction from Severely Blurred Images Using a Single Moving Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Hee Seok Lee, Kuoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: Motion blur frequently occurs in dense 3D reconstruction using a single moving camera, and it degrades the quality of the 3D reconstruction. To handle motion blur caused by rapid camera shakes, we propose a blur-aware depth reconstruction method, which utilizes a pixel correspondence that is obtained by considering the effect of motion blur. Motion blur is dependent on 3D geometry, thus parameterizing blurred appearance of images with scene depth given camera motion is possible and a depth map can be accurately estimated from the blur-considered pixel correspondence. The estimated depth is then converted intopixel-wise blur kernels, and non-uniform motion blur is easily removed with low computational cost. The obtained blur kernel is depth-dependent, thus it effectively addresses scene-depth variation, which is a challenging problem in conventional non-uniform deblurring methods.</p><p>4 0.30294394 <a title="397-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Joint_3D_Scene_Reconstruction_and_Class_Segmentation.html">230 cvpr-2013-Joint 3D Scene Reconstruction and Class Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Häne, Christopher Zach, Andrea Cohen, Roland Angst, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Both image segmentation and dense 3D modeling from images represent an intrinsically ill-posed problem. Strong regularizers are therefore required to constrain the solutions from being ’too noisy’. Unfortunately, these priors generally yield overly smooth reconstructions and/or segmentations in certain regions whereas they fail in other areas to constrain the solution sufficiently. In this paper we argue that image segmentation and dense 3D reconstruction contribute valuable information to each other’s task. As a consequence, we propose a rigorous mathematical framework to formulate and solve a joint segmentation and dense reconstruction problem. Image segmentations provide geometric cues about which surface orientations are more likely to appear at a certain location in space whereas a dense 3D reconstruction yields a suitable regularization for the segmentation problem by lifting the labeling from 2D images to 3D space. We show how appearance-based cues and 3D surface orientation priors can be learned from training data and subsequently used for class-specific regularization. Experimental results on several real data sets highlight the advantages of our joint formulation.</p><p>5 0.2580328 <a title="397-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_Changes_in_3D_Structure_of_a_Scene_from_Multi-view_Images_Captured_by_a_Vehicle-Mounted_Camera.html">117 cvpr-2013-Detecting Changes in 3D Structure of a Scene from Multi-view Images Captured by a Vehicle-Mounted Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Ken Sakurada, Takayuki Okatani, Koichiro Deguchi</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for detecting temporal changes of the three-dimensional structure of an outdoor scene from its multi-view images captured at two separate times. For the images, we consider those captured by a camera mounted on a vehicle running in a city street. The method estimates scene structures probabilistically, not deterministically, and based on their estimates, it evaluates the probability of structural changes in the scene, where the inputs are the similarity of the local image patches among the multi-view images. The aim of the probabilistic treatment is to maximize the accuracy of change detection, behind which there is our conjecture that although it is difficult to estimate the scene structures deterministically, it should be easier to detect their changes. The proposed method is compared with the methods that use multi-view stereo (MVS) to reconstruct the scene structures of the two time points and then differentiate them to detect changes. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms such MVS-based methods.</p><p>6 0.25301838 <a title="397-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Depth_Super_Resolution_by_Rigid_Body_Self-Similarity_in_3D.html">115 cvpr-2013-Depth Super Resolution by Rigid Body Self-Similarity in 3D</a></p>

<p>Author: Ming-Yu Liu, Oncel Tuzel, Yuichi Taguchi</p><p>Abstract: We propose an algorithm utilizing geodesic distances to upsample a low resolution depth image using a registered high resolution color image. Specifically, it computes depth for each pixel in the high resolution image using geodesic paths to the pixels whose depths are known from the low resolution one. Though this is closely related to the all-pairshortest-path problem which has O(n2 log n) complexity, we develop a novel approximation algorithm whose complexity grows linearly with the image size and achieve realtime performance. We compare our algorithm with the state of the art on the benchmark dataset and show that our approach provides more accurate depth upsampling with fewer artifacts. In addition, we show that the proposed algorithm is well suited for upsampling depth images using binary edge maps, an important sensor fusion application.</p><p>3 0.8479445 <a title="397-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Layer_Depth_Denoising_and_Completion_for_Structured-Light_RGB-D_Cameras.html">245 cvpr-2013-Layer Depth Denoising and Completion for Structured-Light RGB-D Cameras</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhe Yang, Zhiwei Xiong, Yueyi Zhang, Jiao Wang, Feng Wu</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes novel density modulated binary patterns for depth acquisition. Similar to Kinect, the illumination patterns do not need a projector for generation and can be emitted by infrared lasers and diffraction gratings. Our key idea is to use the density of light spots in the patterns to carry phase information. Two technical problems are addressed here. First, we propose an algorithm to design the patterns to carry more phase information without compromising the depth reconstruction from a single captured image as with Kinect. Second, since the carried phase is not strictly sinusoidal, the depth reconstructed from the phase contains a systematic error. We further propose a pixelbased phase matching algorithm to reduce the error. Experimental results show that the depth quality can be greatly improved using the phase carried by the density of light spots. Furthermore, our scheme can achieve 20 fps depth reconstruction with GPU assistance.</p><p>5 0.78524876 <a title="397-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_Changes_in_3D_Structure_of_a_Scene_from_Multi-view_Images_Captured_by_a_Vehicle-Mounted_Camera.html">117 cvpr-2013-Detecting Changes in 3D Structure of a Scene from Multi-view Images Captured by a Vehicle-Mounted Camera</a></p>

The superiority of our algorithm is demonstrated by presenting the improved depth map accuracy, image super-resolution results, and camera pose estimation.</p><p>2 0.92029119 <a title="397-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Whitened_Expectation_Propagation%3A_Non-Lambertian_Shape_from_Shading_and_Shadow.html">466 cvpr-2013-Whitened Expectation Propagation: Non-Lambertian Shape from Shading and Shadow</a></p>
<p>Author: Brian Potetz, Mohammadreza Hajiarbabi</p><p>Abstract: For problems over continuous random variables, MRFs with large cliques pose a challenge in probabilistic inference. Difficulties in performing optimization efficiently have limited the probabilistic models explored in computer vision and other fields. One inference technique that handles large cliques well is Expectation Propagation. EP offers run times independent of clique size, which instead depend only on the rank, or intrinsic dimensionality, of potentials. This property would be highly advantageous in computer vision. Unfortunately, for grid-shaped models common in vision, traditional Gaussian EP requires quadratic space and cubic time in the number of pixels. Here, we propose a variation of EP that exploits regularities in natural scene statistics to achieve run times that are linear in both number of pixels and clique size. We test these methods on shape from shading, and we demonstrate strong performance not only for Lambertian surfaces, but also on arbitrary surface reflectance and lighting arrangements, which requires highly non-Gaussian potentials. Finally, we use large, non-local cliques to exploit cast shadow, which is traditionally ignored in shape from shading.</p><p>3 0.9194327 <a title="397-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Continuous_Inference_in_Graphical_Models_with_Polynomial_Energies.html">95 cvpr-2013-Continuous Inference in Graphical Models with Polynomial Energies</a></p>
<p>Author: Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of performing inference in graphical models whose energy is a polynomial function of continuous variables. Our energy minimization method follows a dual decomposition approach, where the global problem is split into subproblems defined over the graph cliques. The optimal solution to these subproblems is obtained by making use of a polynomial system solver. Our algorithm inherits the convergence guarantees of dual decomposition. To speed up optimization, we also introduce a variant of this algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian method. Our experiments illustrate the diversity of computer vision problems that can be expressed with polynomial energies, and demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing continuous inference methods.</p><p>4 0.91594976 <a title="397-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Auxiliary_Cuts_for_General_Classes_of_Higher_Order_Functionals.html">51 cvpr-2013-Auxiliary Cuts for General Classes of Higher Order Functionals</a></p>
<p>Author: Ismail Ben Ayed, Lena Gorelick, Yuri Boykov</p><p>Abstract: Several recent studies demonstrated that higher order (non-linear) functionals can yield outstanding performances in the contexts of segmentation, co-segmentation and tracking. In general, higher order functionals result in difficult problems that are not amenable to standard optimizers, and most of the existing works investigated particular forms of such functionals. In this study, we derive general bounds for a broad class of higher order functionals. By introducing auxiliary variables and invoking the Jensen ’s inequality as well as some convexity arguments, we prove that these bounds are auxiliary functionals for various non-linear terms, which include but are not limited to several affinity measures on the distributions or moments of segment appearance and shape, as well as soft constraints on segment volume. From these general-form bounds, we state various non-linear problems as the optimization of auxiliary functionals by graph cuts. The proposed bound optimizers are derivative-free, and consistently yield very steep functional decreases, thereby converging within a few graph cuts. We report several experiments on color and medical data, along with quantitative comparisons to stateof-the-art methods. The results demonstrate competitive performances of the proposed algorithms in regard to accuracy and convergence speed, and confirm their potential in various vision and medical applications.</p><p>5 0.91583264 <a title="397-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Linear_Approach_to_Matching_Cuboids_in_RGBD_Images.html">16 cvpr-2013-A Linear Approach to Matching Cuboids in RGBD Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Jiang, Jianxiong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel linear method to match cuboids in indoor scenes using RGBD images from Kinect. Beyond depth maps, these cuboids reveal important structures of a scene. Instead of directly fitting cuboids to 3D data, we first construct cuboid candidates using superpixel pairs on a RGBD image, and then we optimize the configuration of the cuboids to satisfy the global structure constraints. The optimal configuration has low local matching costs, small object intersection and occlusion, and the cuboids tend to project to a large region in the image; the number of cuboids is optimized simultaneously. We formulate the multiple cuboid matching problem as a mixed integer linear program and solve the optimization efficiently with a branch and bound method. The optimization guarantees the global optimal solution. Our experiments on the Kinect RGBD images of a variety of indoor scenes show that our proposed method is efficient, accurate and robust against object appearance variations, occlusions and strong clutter.</p><p>6 0.91555554 <a title="397-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Graph-Based_Discriminative_Learning_for_Location_Recognition.html">189 cvpr-2013-Graph-Based Discriminative Learning for Location Recognition</a></p>

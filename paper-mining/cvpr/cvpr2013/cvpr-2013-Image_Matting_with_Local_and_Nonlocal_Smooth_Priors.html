<p>Author: Ehsan Shahrian, Deepu Rajan, Brian Price, Scott Cohen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new image matting algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset of images. This is achieved by solving two major problems encountered by current sampling based algorithms. The first is that the range in which the foreground and background are sampled is often limited to such an extent that the true foreground and background colors are not present. Here, we describe a method by which a more comprehensive and representative set of samples is collected so as not to miss out on the true samples. This is accomplished by expanding the sampling range for pixels farther from the foreground or background boundary and ensuring that samples from each color distribution are included. The second problem is the overlap in color distributions of foreground and background regions. This causes sampling based methods to fail to pick the correct samples for foreground and background. Our design of an objective function forces those foreground and background samples to be picked that are generated from well-separated distributions.

<p>Author: Xiaojie Guo, Xiaochun Cao, Xiaowu Chen, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Given an area of interest in a video sequence, one may want to manipulate or edit the area, e.g. remove occlusions from or replace with an advertisement on it. Such a task involves three main challenges including temporal consistency, spatial pose, and visual realism. The proposed method effectively seeks an optimal solution to simultaneously deal with temporal alignment, pose rectification, as well as precise recovery of the occlusion. To make our method applicable to long video sequences, we propose a batch alignment method for automatically aligning and rectifying a small number of initial frames, and then show how to align the remaining frames incrementally to the aligned base images. From the error residual of the robust alignment process, we automatically construct a trimap of the region for each frame, which is used as the input to alpha matting methods to extract the occluding foreground. Experimental results on both simulated and real data demonstrate the accurate and robust performance of our method.</p><p>4 0.084992252 <a title="211-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Texture_Enhanced_Image_Denoising_via_Gradient_Histogram_Preservation.html">427 cvpr-2013-Texture Enhanced Image Denoising via Gradient Histogram Preservation</a></p>
<p>Author: Wangmeng Zuo, Lei Zhang, Chunwei Song, David Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Image denoising is a classical yet fundamental problem in low level vision, as well as an ideal test bed to evaluate various statistical image modeling methods. One of the most challenging problems in image denoising is how to preserve the fine scale texture structures while removing noise. Various natural image priors, such as gradient based prior, nonlocal self-similarity prior, and sparsity prior, have been extensively exploited for noise removal. The denoising algorithms based on these priors, however, tend to smooth the detailed image textures, degrading the image visual quality. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a texture enhanced image denoising (TEID) method by enforcing the gradient distribution of the denoised image to be close to the estimated gradient distribution of the original image. A novel gradient histogram preservation (GHP) algorithm is developed to enhance the texture structures while removing noise. Our experimental results demonstrate that theproposed GHP based TEID can well preserve the texture features of the denoised images, making them look more natural.</p><p>5 0.077135868 <a title="211-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Ensemble_Video_Object_Cut_in_Highly_Dynamic_Scenes.html">148 cvpr-2013-Ensemble Video Object Cut in Highly Dynamic Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaobo Ren, Tony X. Han, Zhihai He</p><p>Abstract: We consider video object cut as an ensemble of framelevel background-foreground object classifiers which fuses information across frames and refine their segmentation results in a collaborative and iterative manner. Our approach addresses the challenging issues of modeling of background with dynamic textures and segmentation of foreground objects from cluttered scenes. We construct patch-level bagof-words background models to effectively capture the background motion and texture dynamics. We propose a foreground salience graph (FSG) to characterize the similarity of an image patch to the bag-of-words background models in the temporal domain and to neighboring image patches in the spatial domain. We incorporate this similarity information into a graph-cut energy minimization framework for foreground object segmentation. The background-foreground classification results at neighboring frames are fused together to construct a foreground probability map to update the graph weights. The resulting object shapes at neighboring frames are also used as constraints to guide the energy minimization process during graph cut. Our extensive experimental results and performance comparisons over a diverse set of challenging videos with dynamic scenes, including the new Change Detection Challenge Dataset, demonstrate that the proposed ensemble video object cut method outperforms various state-ofthe-art algorithms.</p><p>6 0.075966232 <a title="211-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-From_Local_Similarity_to_Global_Coding%3A_An_Application_to_Image_Classification.html">178 cvpr-2013-From Local Similarity to Global Coding: An Application to Image Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Róisín Rowley-Brooke, François Pitié, Anil Kokaram</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents recent work on a new framework for non-blind document bleed-through removal. The framework includes image preprocessing to remove local intensity variations, pixel region classification based on a segmentation of the joint recto-verso intensity histogram and connected component analysis on the subsequent image labelling. Finally restoration of the degraded regions is performed using exemplar-based image inpainting. The proposed method is evaluated visually and numerically on a freely available database of 25 scanned manuscript image pairs with ground truth, and is shown to outperform recent non-blind bleed-through removal techniques.</p><p>4 0.63931954 <a title="211-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Background_Modeling_Based_on_Bidirectional_Analysis.html">55 cvpr-2013-Background Modeling Based on Bidirectional Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Atsushi Shimada, Hajime Nagahara, Rin-ichiro Taniguchi</p><p>Abstract: Background modeling and subtraction is an essential task in video surveillance applications. Most traditional studies use information observed in past frames to create and update a background model. To adapt to background changes, the backgroundmodel has been enhancedby introducing various forms of information including spatial consistency and temporal tendency. In this paper, we propose a new framework that leverages information from a future period. Our proposed approach realizes a low-cost and highly accurate background model. The proposed framework is called bidirectional background modeling, and performs background subtraction based on bidirectional analysis; i.e., analysis from past to present and analysis from future to present. Although a result will be output with some delay because information is takenfrom a futureperiod, our proposed approach improves the accuracy by about 30% if only a 33-millisecond of delay is acceptable. Furthermore, the memory cost can be reduced by about 65% relative to typical background modeling.</p><p>5 0.57043809 <a title="211-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Video_Editing_with_Temporal%2C_Spatial_and_Appearance_Consistency.html">453 cvpr-2013-Video Editing with Temporal, Spatial and Appearance Consistency</a></p>

<p>Author: Bastien Jacquet, Roland Angst, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Articulated objects represent an important class ofobjects in our everyday environment. Automatic detection of the type of articulated or otherwise restricted motion and extraction of the corresponding motion parameters are therefore of high value, e.g. in order to augment an otherwise static 3D reconstruction with dynamic semantics, such as rotation axes and allowable translation directions for certain rigid parts or objects. Hence, in this paper, a novel theory to analyse relative transformations between two motion-restricted parts will be presented. The analysis is based on linear subspaces spanned by relative transformations. Moreover, a signature for relative transformations will be introduced which uniquely specifies the type of restricted motion encoded in these relative transformations. This theoretic framework enables the derivation of novel algebraic constraints, such as low-rank constraints for subsequent rotations around two fixed axes for example. Lastly, given the type of restricted motion as predicted by the signature, the paper shows how to extract all the motion parameters with matrix manipulations from linear algebra. Our theory is verified on several real data sets, such as a rotating blackboard or a wheel rolling on the floor amongst others.</p><p>4 0.93737155 <a title="211-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_Variational_Reconstruction_of_Non-rigid_Surfaces_from_Monocular_Video.html">113 cvpr-2013-Dense Variational Reconstruction of Non-rigid Surfaces from Monocular Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Ravi Garg, Anastasios Roussos, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: This paper offers the first variational approach to the problem of dense 3D reconstruction of non-rigid surfaces from a monocular video sequence. We formulate nonrigid structure from motion (NRSfM) as a global variational energy minimization problem to estimate dense low-rank smooth 3D shapes for every frame along with the camera motion matrices, given dense 2D correspondences. Unlike traditional factorization based approaches to NRSfM, which model the low-rank non-rigid shape using a fixed number of basis shapes and corresponding coefficients, we minimize the rank of the matrix of time-varying shapes directly via trace norm minimization. In conjunction with this low-rank constraint, we use an edge preserving total-variation regularization term to obtain spatially smooth shapes for every frame. Thanks to proximal splitting techniques the optimization problem can be decomposed into many point-wise sub-problems and simple linear systems which can be easily solved on GPU hardware. We show results on real sequences of different objects (face, torso, beating heart) where, despite challenges in tracking, illumination changes and occlusions, our method reconstructs highly deforming smooth surfaces densely and accurately directly from video, without the need for any prior models or shape templates.</p><p>5 0.86194885 <a title="211-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Illumination_Estimation_Based_on_Bilayer_Sparse_Coding.html">210 cvpr-2013-Illumination Estimation Based on Bilayer Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Li, Weihua Xiong, Weiming Hu, Houwen Peng</p><p>Abstract: Computational color constancy is a very important topic in computer vision and has attracted many researchers ’ attention. Recently, lots of research has shown the effects of using high level visual content cues for improving illumination estimation. However, nearly all the existing methods are essentially combinational strategies in which image ’s content analysis is only used to guide the combination or selection from a variety of individual illumination estimation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel bilayer sparse coding model for illumination estimation that considers image similarity in terms of both low level color distribution and high level image scene content simultaneously. For the purpose, the image ’s scene content information is integrated with its color distribution to obtain optimal illumination estimation model. The experimental results on real-world image sets show that our algorithm is superior to some prevailing illumination estimation methods, even better than some combinational methods.</p><p>6 0.82940882 <a title="211-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Thousand_Frames_in_Just_a_Few_Words%3A_Lingual_Description_of_Videos_through_Latent_Topics_and_Sparse_Object_Stitching.html">28 cvpr-2013-A Thousand Frames in Just a Few Words: Lingual Description of Videos through Latent Topics and Sparse Object Stitching</a></p>

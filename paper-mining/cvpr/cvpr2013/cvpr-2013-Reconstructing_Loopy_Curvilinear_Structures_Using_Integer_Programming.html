</p><p>3 At the heart of our method is an Integer Programming formulation that allows us to find the global optimum of an objective function designed to allow cycles but penalize spurious junctions and early terminations. [sent-9, score-0.321]
</p><p>4 Introduction Networks of curvilinear structures are abundant both in natural and man made systems. [sent-12, score-0.304]
</p><p>5 They appear at all possible scales, ranging from nanometers in Electron Microscopy images of neurons and meters in aerial images of roads to petameters in dark-matter arbors binding massive galaxy clusters. [sent-13, score-0.303]
</p><p>6 As a result, their automated reconstruction has  been one of the earliest topics addressed by computer vision scientists. [sent-14, score-0.152]
</p><p>7 Recently, there has been renewed interest in the reconstruction of tree-like structures and significant progress has been achieved by formulating the problem as one of optimizing a global objective function [26, 25]. [sent-16, score-0.136]
</p><p>8 However, in practice, many interesting networks, such as those formed by the roads and blood vessels depicted by the first row of Fig. [sent-17, score-0.42]

</p><p>12 (Brainbow) Maximum intensity projection of a brainbow [17] stack. [sent-27, score-0.186]
</p><p>13 ducing several spurious cycles that can only be recognized as such once the whole structure has been recovered. [sent-29, score-0.23]
</p><p>14 In fact, this is widely reported as one of the major sources of error [28, 8, 4, 29, 26, 7] and a number of heuristics have been proposed to avoid spurious connections in the presence of such cycles [26, 29, 8]. [sent-30, score-0.23]
</p><p>15 We will show that, in such cases, it is more effective to relax the tree constraint and to build loopy networks by penalizing the formation of spurious junctions and early branch terminations. [sent-33, score-0.524]
</p><p>16 Enforcing tree topology results in creation of spurious junctions. [sent-35, score-0.247]
</p><p>17 The dots depict sample points (seeds) on the centerlines found by maximizing a tubularity measure. [sent-37, score-0.165]
</p><p>18 In 3D, these branches may be disjoint but the z-resolution is insufficient to see it and only a single sample is found at their intersection, which we color yellow. [sent-38, score-0.148]
</p><p>19 (b) The sample points are connected by geodesic paths to form a graph. [sent-39, score-0.237]
</p><p>20 (c,d) The final delineation is obtained by finding a subgraph that minimizes a global cost function. [sent-40, score-0.267]
</p><p>21 In (d), we allow the yellow point to be used twice, and penalize early terminations and spurious junctions, which yields a better result. [sent-42, score-0.135]
</p><p>22 voxels that are very likely to belong to the curvilinear structures of interest. [sent-43, score-0.304]
</p><p>23 We treat them as vertices of a graph and connect those that are within a certain distance of each other by geodesic paths [5] whose quality we assess on  the basis of local image evidence. [sent-44, score-0.39]
</p><p>24 We then look for a subgraph that maximizes a global objective function that combines image-based and geometry-based terms with respect to which edges of the original graph are active. [sent-45, score-0.113]
</p><p>25 However, unlike in this earlier paper, we let graph vertices be used by several branches, thus allowing cycles as shown in Fig. [sent-47, score-0.251]
</p><p>26 Unlike earlier graph-based delineation approaches, ours lets vertices be shared among branches while still allowing the recovery of the optimal tree from the resulting loopy subgraph when the result should be acyclical. [sent-49, score-0.748]
</p><p>27 Related Work  There has recently been a resurgence of interest in automated delineation techniques [18, 10, 20, 14] because extracting curvilinear structures automatically and robustly is of fundamental relevance to many scientific disciplines. [sent-57, score-0.572]
</p><p>28 For example, it has been recognized that “the lack of powerful and effective computational tools to automatically reconstruct neuronal arbors has emerged as a major technical bottleneck in neuroscience research,” as stated on the homepage of the DIADEM challenge [3]. [sent-58, score-0.17]
</p><p>29 Similar statements could be made about medical research involving the fine modeling of complex blood vessel structures, such as those in the lungs, or automated delineation of linear structures in aerial imagery databases. [sent-59, score-0.718]
</p><p>30 Most automated approaches involve greedy strategies that start from a set of seed points, incrementally grow branches by evaluating a local tubularity measure—usually based on the Hessian and Oriented Flux matrices [23, 13, 15]—in the vicinity of the initial seeds [7, 27, 4, 2]. [sent-60, score-0.571]
</p><p>31 High tubularity paths are then iteratively added to the solution and their end points are treated as the new seeds from which the process can be restarted. [sent-61, score-0.35]
</p><p>32 By contrast, graph-based methods find seed points in the whole image or volume by evaluating the tubularity mea-  sure densely and finding its local maxima [12, 22, 27, 26, 25]. [sent-64, score-0.261]
</p><p>33 The seed points are then connected by paths that follow local maxima of the tubularity measure. [sent-66, score-0.443]
</p><p>34 This results in a graph that forms an overcomplete representation of the underlying tree structure and the final step is to build a tree by selecting an optimal subset of the edges. [sent-67, score-0.126]
</p><p>35 As a result, their topology may be wrong and suboptimal post-processing procedures are required to eliminate spurious branches and, possibly, correct topological errors. [sent-70, score-0.332]
</p><p>36 Furthermore, all these spanning-tree approaches 111888222311  evaluate the quality of an edge between two seed points by integrating a function of the tubularity measure along  a connecting path. [sent-73, score-0.37]
</p><p>37 This quality measure usually fails to distinguish legitimate paths along faint curvilinear structures from those that are shortcuts between high-contrast structures. [sent-74, score-0.517]
</p><p>38 The MAP formulation [25] addresses these issues by using path classifiers to score the paths and introducing a Mixed Integer Programming approach to guaranteeing optimality of the resulting solution. [sent-75, score-0.215]
</p><p>39 However, none of these approaches address the delineation problem for loopy structures. [sent-76, score-0.268]
</p><p>40 Method Our algorithm, like those of [12, 29, 27, 26, 25] starts by building a weighted graph designed to be an overcomplete representation for the underlying network of curvilinear structures, such as the one of Fig. [sent-81, score-0.244]
</p><p>41 It then finds an optimal subgraph in terms of an appropriately designed objective function. [sent-83, score-0.113]
</p><p>42 The major difference from these earlier approaches is that instead of constraining the subgraph to be a tree as in Fig. [sent-84, score-0.219]
</p><p>43 2(d), and penalize spurious junctions and early branch terminations. [sent-86, score-0.302]
</p><p>44 In the remainder of this section, we introduce our Integer Programming approach to finding an optimal and potentially loopy subgraph. [sent-88, score-0.114]
</p><p>45 For each pixel or voxel, we first estimate its likelihood ofbeing on the centerline of a curvilinear structure whose radius is within a given range, using a tubularity measure similar to those discussed in Section 2. [sent-93, score-0.371]
</p><p>46 The paths are obtained by minimizing a geodesic distance in (N+1)-D scale space—N spatial dimensions and the radius—as described in [5]. [sent-95, score-0.192]
</p><p>47 A loopy graph with a single root vertex v (in red). [sent-97, score-0.238]
</p><p>48 Allowing vertex c (in green) to be used by the two different branches (denoted by blue and yellow arrows) produces a loopy solution instead of a tree. [sent-98, score-0.339]

</p><p>50 This produces a graph G = (V, E), whose vertices V = {vi} represent the seed points and pairs of oppositely Vdir e=cte {dv edges Ese =t t {eij =d (ovini,t vj) , eji r=s (vj , vpio)s}i tehley paths linking tsh Eem. [sent-100, score-0.397]
</p><p>51 Disallowing cycles prevents vertices from being shared by separate branches, as is required for successful reconstruction cases such as the one of Fig. [sent-103, score-0.246]
</p><p>52 However, in some cases, such as when delineating the neural structures of the Brightfield and Brainbow images of Fig. [sent-107, score-0.136]
</p><p>53 One approach would be to first recover the subgraph defined by the active edges and then attempt to assess its topology. [sent-111, score-0.221]
</p><p>54 However, to consistently enforce geometric constraints on branches even at junctions, we do both simultaneously by reasoning in terms of whether consecutive pairs of edges belong to the final delineation or not. [sent-112, score-0.353]
</p><p>55 3, edge pairs (eic, ecj) and (ekc, ecl) should belong but neither (eic, ecl) nor (ekc, ecj). [sent-114, score-0.16]
</p><p>56 2(d), edge pairs (eij , ejk) and (emj , ejl) are both active and vertex j belongs to both branches. [sent-118, score-0.307]

</p><p>59 As discussed in Section 2, we have found it more effective at distinguishing legitimate paths from spurious ones than more standard methods, such as those that integrate a tubularity  measure along the path. [sent-130, score-0.513]

</p><p>61 However, not all choices of binary values for the indicator variables give rise to a connected subgraph that represents a plausible delineation. [sent-157, score-0.158]
</p><p>62 To avoid having to process them sequentially in a greedy manner, which may result in some branches being “stolen” by the first structure we reconstruct and therefore a suboptimal solution, we connect them all. [sent-162, score-0.195]
</p><p>63 Assuming we are given a set R of seed vertices, one for each structure of interest, we create a virtual root vertex vv and connect it to each vr ∈ R by zero cost edge pairs containing all other vertices to wh∈ic Rh vr is connected. [sent-163, score-0.87]
</p><p>64 4 are such that  seed vertices are not isolated, branches are edge-disjoint, potential crossovers are consistently handled, and all active edge pairs are connected. [sent-165, score-0.587]
</p><p>65 Non-isolated Seeds: We require the seed vertices vr ∈ R to be connected to at least one vertex other than the vir∈tu Ral root vv and to have no incoming edge other than evr. [sent-166, score-0.769]
</p><p>66 (5)  Disjoint Edges: For each edge eij ∈ E, we let at most one edge pair be active among all tho∈se tEh,at w weieth leert caot nmtaoisnt eij or sufficiently overlap with it. [sent-177, score-0.854]
</p><p>67 We do the first by preventing the number of active incoming edge pairs into an edge to be more than one. [sent-178, score-0.403]
</p><p>68 Let tij denote 111888222533  the geodesic path corresponding to edge  ? [sent-180, score-0.242]
</p><p>69 In the example depicted by the figure above, among all the edge pairs incoming to the edges eij, ek1l1 and ek2l2 , only one can be active in the final solution. [sent-193, score-0.343]
</p><p>70 For those curvilinear structures that are inherently trees, these constraints make their recovery from the resulting subgraph possible by starting from the terminal vertices and following the active edge pairs along the paths that lead to the root vertices. [sent-194, score-0.944]
</p><p>71 Crossover Consistency: A potential crossover in G is a vertex, which is adjacent to at least four other vertices and whose in- and out-degrees are greater than one. [sent-195, score-0.151]

</p><p>73 For inherently loopy ones, such as the roads and blood vessels, we deactivate them to allow creation of junctions that are parts of legitimate cycles. [sent-210, score-0.553]
</p><p>74 Connectedness: We require all the active edge pairs to be connected to the virtual root vv. [sent-211, score-0.361]
</p><p>75 An edge pair eijk is said to be connected if there exists a path in G, starting at vv and containing eijk, along which all the edge pairs are active. [sent-212, score-0.64]

</p><p>80 Finally, the last three constraints bind the flow variables to the binary ones, ensuring that a connected network formed by the non-zero flow variables is also connected in the active edge pair variables. [sent-240, score-0.307]
</p><p>81 Note that, since we are looking for possibly cyclic subgraphs, there can be multiple paths incoming to a vertex. [sent-241, score-0.276]
</p><p>82 We then present our results on the first two, which contain cyclic networks, and finally on the next two, which contain true trees but whose optical resolution is so poor that they look like cyclic graphs. [sent-252, score-0.202]

<p>Author: Ning Zhu, Albert C.S. Chung</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for 3D vessel tree structure segmentation based on a new tubularity Markov tree model ( TMT), which works as both new energy function and graph construction method. With the help of power-watershed implementation [7], a global optimal segmentation can be obtained with low computational cost. Different with other graph-based vessel segmentation methods, the proposed method does not depend on any skeleton and ROI extraction method. The classical issues of the graph-based methods, such as shrinking bias and sensitivity to seed point location, can be solved with the proposed method thanks to vessel data fidelity obtained with TMT. The proposed method is compared with some classical graph-based image segmentation methods and two up-to-date 3D vessel segmentation methods, and is demonstrated to be more accurate than these methods for 3D vessel tree segmentation. Although the segmentation is done without ROI extraction, the computational cost for the proposed method is low (within 20 seconds for 256*256*144 image).</p><p>3 0.15810499 <a title="350-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Recovering_Line-Networks_in_Images_by_Junction-Point_Processes.html">351 cvpr-2013-Recovering Line-Networks in Images by Junction-Point Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Dengfeng Chai, Wolfgang Förstner, Florent Lafarge</p><p>Abstract: The automatic extraction of line-networks from images is a well-known computer vision issue. Appearance and shape considerations have been deeply explored in the literature to improve accuracy in presence of occlusions, shadows, and a wide variety of irrelevant objects. However most existing works have ignored the structural aspect of the problem. We present an original method which provides structurally-coherent solutions. Contrary to the pixelbased and object-based methods, our result is a graph in which each node represents either a connection or an ending in the line-network. Based on stochastic geometry, we develop a new family of point processes consisting in sampling junction-points in the input image by using a Monte Carlo mechanism. The quality of a configuration is measured by a probability density which takes into account both image consistency and shape priors. Our experiments on a variety of problems illustrate the potential of our approach in terms of accuracy, flexibility and efficiency.</p><p>4 0.10081896 <a title="350-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Lagrangian_Relaxation_to_Min-cost_Network_Flow.html">300 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Asad A. Butt, Robert T. Collins</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for global multi-target tracking that can incorporate higher-order track smoothness constraints such as constant velocity. Our problem formulation readily lends itself to path estimation in a trellis graph, but unlike previous methods, each node in our network represents a candidate pair of matching observations between consecutive frames. Extra constraints on binary flow variables in the graph result in a problem that can no longer be solved by min-cost network flow. We therefore propose an iterative solution method that relaxes these extra constraints using Lagrangian relaxation, resulting in a series of problems that ARE solvable by min-cost flow, and that progressively improve towards a high-quality solution to our original optimization problem. We present experimental results showing that our method outperforms the standard network-flow formulation as well as other recent algorithms that attempt to incorporate higher-order smoothness constraints.</p><p>5 0.097381555 <a title="350-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Higher-Order_CRF_Model_for_Road_Network_Extraction.html">13 cvpr-2013-A Higher-Order CRF Model for Road Network Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan D. Wegner, Javier A. Montoya-Zegarra, Konrad Schindler</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to extract the road network from aerial images. What makes the problem challenging is the complex structure of the prior: roads form a connected network of smooth, thin segments which meet at junctions and crossings. This type of a-priori knowledge is more difficult to turn into a tractable model than standard smoothness or co-occurrence assumptions. We develop a novel CRF formulation for road labeling, in which the prior is represented by higher-order cliques that connect sets of superpixels along straight line segments. These long-range cliques have asymmetric PN-potentials, which express a preference to assign all rather than just some of their constituent superpixels to the road class. Thus, the road likelihood is amplified for thin chains of superpixels, while the CRF is still amenable to optimization with graph cuts. Since the number of such cliques of arbitrary length is huge, we furthermorepropose a sampling scheme which concentrates on those cliques which are most relevant for the optimization. In experiments on two different databases the model significantly improves both the per-pixel accuracy and the topological correctness of the extracted roads, and outper- forms both a simple smoothness prior and heuristic rulebased road completion.</p><p>6 0.095131971 <a title="350-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Incorporating_User_Interaction_and_Topological_Constraints_within_Contour_Completion_via_Discrete_Calculus.html">222 cvpr-2013-Incorporating User Interaction and Topological Constraints within Contour Completion via Discrete Calculus</a></p>

<p>Author: Ning Zhu, Albert C.S. Chung</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for 3D vessel tree structure segmentation based on a new tubularity Markov tree model ( TMT), which works as both new energy function and graph construction method. With the help of power-watershed implementation [7], a global optimal segmentation can be obtained with low computational cost. Different with other graph-based vessel segmentation methods, the proposed method does not depend on any skeleton and ROI extraction method. The classical issues of the graph-based methods, such as shrinking bias and sensitivity to seed point location, can be solved with the proposed method thanks to vessel data fidelity obtained with TMT. The proposed method is compared with some classical graph-based image segmentation methods and two up-to-date 3D vessel segmentation methods, and is demonstrated to be more accurate than these methods for 3D vessel tree segmentation. Although the segmentation is done without ROI extraction, the computational cost for the proposed method is low (within 20 seconds for 256*256*144 image).</p><p>4 0.61273456 <a title="350-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Lagrangian_Relaxation_to_Min-cost_Network_Flow.html">300 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow</a></p>

<p>Author: Hu Ding, Branislav Stojkovic, Ronald Berezney, Jinhui Xu</p><p>Abstract: Computing accurate and robust organizational patterns of chromosome territories inside the cell nucleus is critical for understanding several fundamental genomic processes, such as co-regulation of gene activation, gene silencing, X chromosome inactivation, and abnormal chromosome rearrangement in cancer cells. The usage of advanced fluorescence labeling and image processing techniques has enabled researchers to investigate interactions of chromosome territories at large spatial resolution. The resulting high volume of generated data demands for high-throughput and automated image analysis methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithmic tool for investigating association patterns of chromosome territories in a population of cells. Our method takes as input a set of graphs, one for each cell, containing information about spatial interaction of chromosome territories, and yields a single graph that contains essential information for the whole population and stands as its structural representative. We formulate this combinato- rial problem as a semi-definite programming and present novel techniques to efficiently solve it. We validate our approach on both artificial and real biological data; the experimental results suggest that our approach yields a nearoptimal solution, and can handle large-size datasets, which are significant improvements over existing techniques.</p><p>6 0.56963867 <a title="350-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>

<p>Author: Alessandro Perina, Nebojsa Jojic</p><p>Abstract: Recently, the Counting Grid (CG) model [5] was developed to represent each input image as a point in a large grid of feature counts. This latent point is a corner of a window of grid points which are all uniformly combined to match the (normalized) feature counts in the image. Being a bag of word model with spatial layout in the latent space, the CG model has superior handling of field of view changes in comparison to other bag of word models, but with the price of being essentially a mixture, mapping each scene to a single window in the grid. In this paper we introduce a family of componential models, dubbed the Componential Counting Grid, whose members represent each input image by multiple latent locations, rather than just one. In this way, we make a substantially more flexible admixture model which captures layers or parts of images and maps them to separate windows in a Counting Grid. We tested the models on scene and place classification where their com- ponential nature helped to extract objects, to capture parallax effects, thus better fitting the data and outperforming Counting Grids and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, especially on sequences taken with wearable cameras.</p><p>3 0.69592005 <a title="350-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_the_Change_for_Automatic_Image_Cropping.html">263 cvpr-2013-Learning the Change for Automatic Image Cropping</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianzhou Yan, Stephen Lin, Sing Bing Kang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: Image cropping is a common operation used to improve the visual quality of photographs. In this paper, we present an automatic cropping technique that accounts for the two primary considerations of people when they crop: removal of distracting content, and enhancement of overall composition. Our approach utilizes a large training set consisting of photos before and after cropping by expert photographers to learn how to evaluate these two factors in a crop. In contrast to the many methods that exist for general assessment of image quality, ours specifically examines differences between the original and cropped photo in solving for the crop parameters. To this end, several novel image features are proposed to model the changes in image content and composition when a crop is applied. Our experiments demonstrate improvements of our method over recent cropping algorithms on a broad range of images.</p><p>4 0.65569508 <a title="350-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Trust_Region_for_Segmentation.html">171 cvpr-2013-Fast Trust Region for Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Lena Gorelick, Frank R. Schmidt, Yuri Boykov</p><p>Abstract: Trust region is a well-known general iterative approach to optimization which offers many advantages over standard gradient descent techniques. In particular, it allows more accurate nonlinear approximation models. In each iteration this approach computes a global optimum of a suitable approximation model within a fixed radius around the current solution, a.k.a. trust region. In general, this approach can be used only when some efficient constrained optimization algorithm is available for the selected nonlinear (more accurate) approximation model. In this paper we propose a Fast Trust Region (FTR) approach for optimization of segmentation energies with nonlinear regional terms, which are known to be challenging for existing algorithms. These energies include, but are not limited to, KL divergence and Bhattacharyya distance between the observed and the target appearance distributions, volume constraint on segment size, and shape prior constraint in a form of 퐿2 distance from target shape moments. Our method is 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the existing state-of-the-art methods while converging to comparable or better solutions.</p><p>5 0.6527276 <a title="350-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Real-Time_Tracking_of_Multiple_Objects_by_Volumetric_Mass_Densities.html">365 cvpr-2013-Robust Real-Time Tracking of Multiple Objects by Volumetric Mass Densities</a></p>
<p>Author: Horst Possegger, Sabine Sternig, Thomas Mauthner, Peter M. Roth, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: Combining foreground images from multiple views by projecting them onto a common ground-plane has been recently applied within many multi-object tracking approaches. These planar projections introduce severe artifacts and constrain most approaches to objects moving on a common 2D ground-plane. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of an occupancy volume exploiting the full geometry and the objects ’ center of mass and develop an efficient algorithm for 3D object tracking. Individual objects are tracked using the local mass density scores within a particle filter based approach, constrained by a Voronoi partitioning between nearby trackers. Our method benefits from the geometric knowledge given by the occupancy volume to robustly extract features and train classifiers on-demand, when volumetric information becomes unreliable. We evaluate our approach on several challenging real-world scenarios including the public APIDIS dataset. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-theart methods, while achieving real-time performance. – –</p><p>6 0.65169936 <a title="350-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Collections_of_Part_Models_for_Object_Recognition.html">248 cvpr-2013-Learning Collections of Part Models for Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Babak Saleh, Ali Farhadi, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: When describing images, humans tend not to talk about the obvious, but rather mention what they find interesting. We argue that abnormalities and deviations from typicalities are among the most important components that form what is worth mentioning. In this paper we introduce the abnormality detection as a recognition problem and show how to model typicalities and, consequently, meaningful deviations from prototypical properties of categories. Our model can recognize abnormalities and report the main reasons of any recognized abnormality. We also show that abnormality predictions can help image categorization. We introduce the abnormality detection dataset and show interesting results on how to reason about abnormalities.</p><p>3 0.16733314 <a title="214-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Studying_Relationships_between_Human_Gaze%2C_Description%2C_and_Computer_Vision.html">416 cvpr-2013-Studying Relationships between Human Gaze, Description, and Computer Vision</a></p>

<p>Author: Qiang Zhang, Baoxin Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with a novel problem: learning temporal models using only relative information. Such a problem arises naturally in many applications involving motion or video data. Our focus in this paper is on videobased surgical training, in which a key task is to rate the performance of a trainee based on a video capturing his motion. Compared with the conventional method of relying on ratings from senior surgeons, an automatic approach to this problem is desirable for its potential lower cost, better objectiveness, and real-time availability. To this end, we propose a novel formulation termed Relative Hidden Markov Model and develop an algorithm for obtaining a solution under this model. The proposed method utilizes only a relative ranking (based on an attribute of interest) between pairs of the inputs, which is easier to obtain and often more consistent, especially for the chosen application domain. The proposed algorithm effectively learns a model from the training data so that the attribute under consideration is linked to the likelihood of the inputs under the learned model. Hence the model can be used to compare new sequences. Synthetic data is first used to systematically evaluate the model and the algorithm, and then we experiment with real data from a surgical training system. The experimental results suggest that the proposed approach provides a promising solution to the real-world problem of motion skill evaluation from video.</p><p>5 0.12818396 <a title="214-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Revisiting_Depth_Layers_from_Occlusions.html">357 cvpr-2013-Revisiting Depth Layers from Occlusions</a></p>
<p>Author: Adarsh Kowdle, Andrew Gallagher, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we consider images of a scene with a moving object captured by a static camera. As the object (human or otherwise) moves about the scene, it reveals pairwise depth-ordering or occlusion cues. The goal of this work is to use these sparse occlusion cues along with monocular depth occlusion cues to densely segment the scene into depth layers. We cast the problem of depth-layer segmentation as a discrete labeling problem on a spatiotemporal Markov Random Field (MRF) that uses the motion occlusion cues along with monocular cues and a smooth motion prior for the moving object. We quantitatively show that depth ordering produced by the proposed combination of the depth cues from object motion and monocular occlusion cues are superior to using either feature independently, and using a na¨ ıve combination of the features.</p><p>6 0.1260034 <a title="214-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Online_Dominant_and_Anomalous_Behavior_Detection_in_Videos.html">313 cvpr-2013-Online Dominant and Anomalous Behavior Detection in Videos</a></p>

We specifically target interactions between children aged 1–2 years and an adult. Such interactions arise naturally in the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as autism. We introduce a new publicly-available dataset containing over 160 sessions of a 3–5 minute child-adult interaction. In each session, the adult examiner followed a semistructured play interaction protocol which was designed to elicit a broad range of social behaviors. We identify the key technical challenges in analyzing these behaviors, and describe methods for decoding the interactions. We present experimental results that demonstrate the potential of the dataset to drive interesting research questions, and show preliminary results for multi-modal activity recognition.</p><p>3 0.59936732 <a title="214-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Social_Role_Discovery_in_Human_Events.html">402 cvpr-2013-Social Role Discovery in Human Events</a></p>
<p>Author: Vignesh Ramanathan, Bangpeng Yao, Li Fei-Fei</p><p>Abstract: We deal with the problem of recognizing social roles played by people in an event. Social roles are governed by human interactions, and form a fundamental component of human event description. We focus on a weakly supervised setting, where we are provided different videos belonging to an event class, without training role labels. Since social roles are described by the interaction between people in an event, we propose a Conditional Random Field to model the inter-role interactions, along with person specific social descriptors. We develop tractable variational inference to simultaneously infer model weights, as well as role assignment to all people in the videos. We also present a novel YouTube social roles dataset with ground truth role annotations, and introduce annotations on a subset of videos from the TRECVID-MED11 [1] event kits for evaluation purposes. The performance of the model is compared against different baseline methods on these datasets.</p><p>4 0.58986652 <a title="214-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-agent_Event_Detection%3A_Localization_and_Role_Assignment.html">292 cvpr-2013-Multi-agent Event Detection: Localization and Role Assignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Suha Kwak, Bohyung Han, Joon Hee Han</p><p>Abstract: We present a joint estimation technique of event localization and role assignment when the target video event is described by a scenario. Specifically, to detect multi-agent events from video, our algorithm identifies agents involved in an event and assigns roles to the participating agents. Instead of iterating through all possible agent-role combinations, we formulate the joint optimization problem as two efficient subproblems—quadratic programming for role assignment followed by linear programming for event localization. Additionally, we reduce the computational complexity significantly by applying role-specific event detectors to each agent independently. We test the performance of our algorithm in natural videos, which contain multiple target events and nonparticipating agents.</p><p>5 0.5878281 <a title="214-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Studying_Relationships_between_Human_Gaze%2C_Description%2C_and_Computer_Vision.html">416 cvpr-2013-Studying Relationships between Human Gaze, Description, and Computer Vision</a></p>

<p>Author: Henrik Zimmer, Marcel Campen, Leif Kobbelt</p><p>Abstract: In the context of shape segmentation and retrieval object-wide distributions of measures are needed to accurately evaluate and compare local regions ofshapes. Lien et al. [16] proposed two point-wise concavity measures in the context of Approximate Convex Decompositions of polygons measuring the distance from a point to the polygon ’s convex hull: an accurate Shortest Path-Concavity (SPC) measure and a Straight Line-Concavity (SLC) approximation of the same. While both are practicable on 2D shapes, the exponential costs of SPC in 3D makes it inhibitively expensive for a generalization to meshes [14]. In this paper we propose an efficient and straight forward approximation of the Shortest Path-Concavity measure to 3D meshes. Our approximation is based on discretizing the space between mesh and convex hull, thereby reducing the continuous Shortest Path search to an efficiently solvable graph problem. Our approach works outof-the-box on complex mesh topologies and requires no complicated handling of genus. Besides presenting a rigorous evaluation of our method on a variety of input meshes, we also define an SPC-based Shape Descriptor and show its superior retrieval and runtime performance compared with the recently presented results on the Convexity Distribution by Lian et al. [12].</p><p>2 0.79361773 <a title="214-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Max-Margin_Riffled_Independence_Model_for_Image_Tag_Ranking.html">18 cvpr-2013-A Max-Margin Riffled Independence Model for Image Tag Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Tian Lan, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose Max-Margin Riffled Independence Model (MMRIM), a new method for image tag ranking modeling the structured preferences among tags. The goal is to predict a ranked tag list for a given image, where tags are ordered by their importance or relevance to the image content. Our model integrates the max-margin formalism with riffled independence factorizations proposed in [10], which naturally allows for structured learning and efficient ranking. Experimental results on the SUN Attribute and LabelMe datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared with baseline tag ranking methods. We also apply the predicted rank list of tags to several higher-level computer vision applications in image understanding and retrieval, and demonstrate that MMRIM significantly improves the accuracy of these applications.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.74377215 <a title="214-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Image_Understanding_from_Experts%27_Eyes_by_Modeling_Perceptual_Skill_of_Diagnostic_Reasoning_Processes.html">214 cvpr-2013-Image Understanding from Experts' Eyes by Modeling Perceptual Skill of Diagnostic Reasoning Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Li, Pengcheng Shi, Anne R. Haake</p><p>Abstract: Eliciting and representing experts ’ remarkable perceptual capability of locating, identifying and categorizing objects in images specific to their domains of expertise will benefit image understanding in terms of transferring human domain knowledge and perceptual expertise into image-based computational procedures. In this paper, we present a hierarchical probabilistic framework to summarize the stereotypical and idiosyncratic eye movement patterns shared within 11 board-certified dermatologists while they are examining and diagnosing medical images. Each inferred eye movement pattern characterizes the similar temporal and spatial properties of its corresponding seg. edu anne .haake @ rit . edu , ments of the experts ’ eye movement sequences. We further discover a subset of distinctive eye movement patterns which are commonly exhibited across multiple images. Based on the combinations of the exhibitions of these eye movement patterns, we are able to categorize the images from the perspective of experts’ viewing strategies. In each category, images share similar lesion distributions and configurations. The performance of our approach shows that modeling physicians ’ diagnostic viewing behaviors informs about medical images’ understanding to correct diagnosis.</p><p>4 0.74248755 <a title="214-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Kernel_Methods_on_the_Riemannian_Manifold_of_Symmetric_Positive_Definite_Matrices.html">238 cvpr-2013-Kernel Methods on the Riemannian Manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices have become popular to encode image information. Accounting for the geometry of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices has proven key to the success of many algorithms. However, most existing methods only approximate the true shape of the manifold locally by its tangent plane. In this paper, inspired by kernel methods, we propose to map SPD matrices to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To encode the geometry of the manifold in the mapping, we introduce a family of provably positive definite kernels on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. These kernels are derived from the Gaussian kernel, but exploit different metrics on the manifold. This lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM and kernel PCA, to the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the problems of pedestrian detection, object categorization, texture analysis, 2D motion segmentation and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) segmentation.</p><p>5 0.70618206 <a title="214-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Plane-Based_Content_Preserving_Warps_for_Video_Stabilization.html">333 cvpr-2013-Plane-Based Content Preserving Warps for Video Stabilization</a></p>
<p>Author: Zihan Zhou, Hailin Jin, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Recently, a new image deformation technique called content-preserving warping (CPW) has been successfully employed to produce the state-of-the-art video stabilization results in many challenging cases. The key insight of CPW is that the true image deformation due to viewpoint change can be well approximated by a carefully constructed warp using a set of sparsely constructed 3D points only. However, since CPW solely relies on the tracked feature points to guide the warping, it works poorly in large textureless regions, such as ground and building interiors. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we present a hybrid approach for novel view synthesis, observing that the textureless regions often correspond to large planar surfaces in the scene. Particularly, given a jittery video, we first segment each frame into piecewise planar regions as well as regions labeled as non-planar using Markov random fields. Then, a new warp is computed by estimating a single homography for regions belong to the same plane, while in- heriting results from CPW in the non-planar regions. We demonstrate how the segmentation information can be efficiently obtained and seamlessly integrated into the stabilization framework. Experimental results on a variety of real video sequences verify the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>6 0.70517194 <a title="214-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Cloud_Motion_as_a_Calibration_Cue.html">84 cvpr-2013-Cloud Motion as a Calibration Cue</a></p>

<p>Author: Dengfeng Chai, Wolfgang Förstner, Florent Lafarge</p><p>Abstract: The automatic extraction of line-networks from images is a well-known computer vision issue. Appearance and shape considerations have been deeply explored in the literature to improve accuracy in presence of occlusions, shadows, and a wide variety of irrelevant objects. However most existing works have ignored the structural aspect of the problem. We present an original method which provides structurally-coherent solutions. Contrary to the pixelbased and object-based methods, our result is a graph in which each node represents either a connection or an ending in the line-network. Based on stochastic geometry, we develop a new family of point processes consisting in sampling junction-points in the input image by using a Monte Carlo mechanism. The quality of a configuration is measured by a probability density which takes into account both image consistency and shape priors. Our experiments on a variety of problems illustrate the potential of our approach in terms of accuracy, flexibility and efficiency.</p><p>4 0.078855343 <a title="190-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Separable_Filters.html">255 cvpr-2013-Learning Separable Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Roberto Rigamonti, Amos Sironi, Vincent Lepetit, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: Learning filters to produce sparse image representations in terms of overcomplete dictionaries has emerged as a powerful way to create image features for many different purposes. Unfortunately, these filters are usually both numerous and non-separable, making their use computationally expensive. In this paper, we show that such filters can be computed as linear combinations of a smaller number of separable ones, thus greatly reducing the computational complexity at no cost in terms of performance. This makes filter learning approaches practical even for large images or 3D volumes, and we show that we significantly outperform state-of-theart methods on the linear structure extraction task, in terms ofboth accuracy and speed. Moreover, our approach is general and can be used on generic filter banks to reduce the complexity of the convolutions.</p><p>5 0.07359726 <a title="190-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Label_Trees_for_Efficient_Large_Scale_Image_Classification.html">340 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Label Trees for Efficient Large Scale Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Baoyuan Liu, Fereshteh Sadeghi, Marshall Tappen, Ohad Shamir, Ce Liu</p><p>Abstract: Large-scale recognition problems with thousands of classes pose a particular challenge because applying the classifier requires more computation as the number of classes grows. The label tree model integrates classification with the traversal of the tree so that complexity grows logarithmically. In this paper, we show how the parameters of the label tree can be found using maximum likelihood estimation. This new probabilistic learning technique produces a label tree with significantly improved recognition accuracy.</p><p>6 0.070994362 <a title="190-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Fast_and_Accurate_Segmentation.html">437 cvpr-2013-Towards Fast and Accurate Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jan D. Wegner, Javier A. Montoya-Zegarra, Konrad Schindler</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to extract the road network from aerial images. What makes the problem challenging is the complex structure of the prior: roads form a connected network of smooth, thin segments which meet at junctions and crossings. This type of a-priori knowledge is more difficult to turn into a tractable model than standard smoothness or co-occurrence assumptions. We develop a novel CRF formulation for road labeling, in which the prior is represented by higher-order cliques that connect sets of superpixels along straight line segments. These long-range cliques have asymmetric PN-potentials, which express a preference to assign all rather than just some of their constituent superpixels to the road class. Thus, the road likelihood is amplified for thin chains of superpixels, while the CRF is still amenable to optimization with graph cuts. Since the number of such cliques of arbitrary length is huge, we furthermorepropose a sampling scheme which concentrates on those cliques which are most relevant for the optimization. In experiments on two different databases the model significantly improves both the per-pixel accuracy and the topological correctness of the extracted roads, and outper- forms both a simple smoothness prior and heuristic rulebased road completion.</p><p>5 0.50969678 <a title="190-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Lost%21_Leveraging_the_Crowd_for_Probabilistic_Visual_Self-Localization.html">274 cvpr-2013-Lost!

<p>Author: Marcus A. Brubaker, Andreas Geiger, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose an affordable solution to selflocalization, which utilizes visual odometry and road maps as the only inputs. To this end, we present a probabilistic model as well as an efficient approximate inference algorithm, which is able to utilize distributed computation to meet the real-time requirements of autonomous systems. Because of the probabilistic nature of the model we are able to cope with uncertainty due to noisy visual odometry and inherent ambiguities in the map (e.g., in a Manhattan world). By exploiting freely available, community developed maps and visual odometry measurements, we are able to localize a vehicle up to 3m after only a few seconds of driving on maps which contain more than 2,150km of drivable roads.</p><p>6 0.45263925 <a title="190-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Groupwise_Registration_via_Graph_Shrinkage_on_the_Image_Manifold.html">194 cvpr-2013-Groupwise Registration via Graph Shrinkage on the Image Manifold</a></p>

While the image structures found by most state-of-the-art detectors, such as blobs and corners, occur typically on planar highly textured surfaces, salient symmetries are widespread in diverse kinds of images, including those related to untextured objects, which are hardly dealt with by current feature-based recognition pipelines. We provide experimental results on standard datasets and also contribute with a new dataset focused on untextured objects. Based on the positive experimental results, we hope to foster further research on the promising topic ofscale invariant analysis through the wave equation.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.57723242 <a title="190-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Graph-Based_Optimization_with_Tubularity_Markov_Tree_for_3D_Vessel_Segmentation.html">190 cvpr-2013-Graph-Based Optimization with Tubularity Markov Tree for 3D Vessel Segmentation</a></p>

Although the segmentation is done without ROI extraction, the computational cost for the proposed method is low (within 20 seconds for 256*256*144 image).</p><p>3 0.56160837 <a title="190-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Shading-Based_Shape_Refinement_of_RGB-D_Images.html">394 cvpr-2013-Shading-Based Shape Refinement of RGB-D Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Lap-Fai Yu, Sai-Kit Yeung, Yu-Wing Tai, Stephen Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present a shading-based shape refinement algorithm which uses a noisy, incomplete depth map from Kinect to help resolve ambiguities in shape-from-shading. In our framework, the partial depth information is used to overcome bas-relief ambiguity in normals estimation, as well as to assist in recovering relative albedos, which are needed to reliably estimate the lighting environment and to separate shading from albedo. This refinement of surface normals using a noisy depth map leads to high-quality 3D surfaces. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through several challenging real-world examples.</p><p>4 0.51330978 <a title="190-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-parametric_Filtering_for_Geometric_Detail_Extraction_and_Material_Representation.html">305 cvpr-2013-Non-parametric Filtering for Geometric Detail Extraction and Material Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zicheng Liao, Jason Rock, Yang Wang, David Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: Geometric detail is a universal phenomenon in real world objects. It is an important component in object modeling, but not accounted for in current intrinsic image works. In this work, we explore using a non-parametric method to separate geometric detail from intrinsic image components. We further decompose an image as albedo ∗ (ccoomarpsoen-escnatsle. shading +e shading pdoestaeil a).n Oaugre decomposition offers quantitative improvement in albedo recovery and material classification.Our method also enables interesting image editing activities, including bump removal, geometric detail smoothing/enhancement and material transfer.</p><p>5 0.51097941 <a title="190-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Voxel_Cloud_Connectivity_Segmentation_-_Supervoxels_for_Point_Clouds.html">458 cvpr-2013-Voxel Cloud Connectivity Segmentation - Supervoxels for Point Clouds</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeremie Papon, Alexey Abramov, Markus Schoeler, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised over-segmentation of an image into regions of perceptually similar pixels, known as superpixels, is a widely used preprocessing step in segmentation algorithms. Superpixel methods reduce the number of regions that must be considered later by more computationally expensive algorithms, with a minimal loss of information. Nevertheless, as some information is inevitably lost, it is vital that superpixels not cross object boundaries, as such errors will propagate through later steps. Existing methods make use of projected color or depth information, but do not consider three dimensional geometric relationships between observed data points which can be used to prevent superpixels from crossing regions of empty space. We propose a novel over-segmentation algorithm which uses voxel relationships to produce over-segmentations which are fully consistent with the spatial geometry of the scene in three dimensional, rather than projective, space. Enforcing the constraint that segmented regions must have spatial connectivity prevents label flow across semantic object boundaries which might otherwise be violated. Additionally, as the algorithm works directly in 3D space, observations from several calibrated RGB+D cameras can be segmented jointly. Experiments on a large data set of human annotated RGB+D images demonstrate a significant reduction in occurrence of clusters crossing object boundaries, while maintaining speeds comparable to state-of-the-art 2D methods.</p><p>6 0.46965238 <a title="190-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Bayesian_Depth-from-Defocus_with_Shading_Constraints.html">56 cvpr-2013-Bayesian Depth-from-Defocus with Shading Constraints</a></p>

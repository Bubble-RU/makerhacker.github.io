<p>Author: Simon Hawe, Matthias Seibert, Martin Kleinsteuber</p><p>Abstract: Many techniques in computer vision, machine learning, and statistics rely on the fact that a signal of interest admits a sparse representation over some dictionary. Dictionaries are either available analytically, or can be learned from a suitable training set. While analytic dictionaries permit to capture the global structure of a signal and allow a fast implementation, learned dictionaries often perform better in applications as they are more adapted to the considered class of signals. In imagery, unfortunately, the numerical burden for (i) learning a dictionary and for (ii) employing the dictionary for reconstruction tasks only allows to deal with relatively small image patches that only capture local image information. The approach presented in this paper aims at overcoming these drawbacks by allowing a separable structure on the dictionary throughout the learning process. On the one hand, this permits larger patch-sizes for the learning phase, on the other hand, the dictionary is applied efficiently in reconstruction tasks. The learning procedure is based on optimizing over a product of spheres which updates the dictionary as a whole, thus enforces basic dictionary proper- , ties such as mutual coherence explicitly during the learning procedure. In the special case where no separable structure is enforced, our method competes with state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods like K-SVD.</p><p>3 0.22275546 <a title="204-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-level_Discriminative_Dictionary_Learning_towards_Hierarchical_Visual_Categorization.html">296 cvpr-2013-Multi-level Discriminative Dictionary Learning towards Hierarchical Visual Categorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Li Shen, Shuhui Wang, Gang Sun, Shuqiang Jiang, Qingming Huang</p><p>Abstract: For the task of visual categorization, the learning model is expected to be endowed with discriminative visual feature representation and flexibilities in processing many categories. Many existing approaches are designed based on a flat category structure, or rely on a set of pre-computed visual features, hence may not be appreciated for dealing with large numbers of categories. In this paper, we propose a novel dictionary learning method by taking advantage of hierarchical category correlation. For each internode of the hierarchical category structure, a discriminative dictionary and a set of classification models are learnt for visual categorization, and the dictionaries in different layers are learnt to exploit the discriminative visual properties of different granularity. Moreover, the dictionaries in lower levels also inherit the dictionary of ancestor nodes, so that categories in lower levels are described with multi-scale visual information using our dictionary learning approach. Experiments on ImageNet object data subset and SUN397 scene dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves promising performance on data with large numbers of classes compared with some state-of-the-art methods, and is more efficient in processing large numbers of categories.</p><p>4 0.21974778 <a title="204-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Beta_Process_Joint_Dictionary_Learning_for_Coupled_Feature_Spaces_with_Application_to_Single_Image_Super-Resolution.html">58 cvpr-2013-Beta Process Joint Dictionary Learning for Coupled Feature Spaces with Application to Single Image Super-Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Li He, Hairong Qi, Russell Zaretzki</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning overcomplete dictionaries for the coupled feature spaces, where the learned dictionaries also reflect the relationship between the two spaces. A Bayesian method using a beta process prior is applied to learn the over-complete dictionaries. Compared to previous couple feature spaces dictionary learning algorithms, our algorithm not only provides dictionaries that customized to each feature space, but also adds more consistent and accurate mapping between the two feature spaces. This is due to the unique property of the beta process model that the sparse representation can be decomposed to values and dictionary atom indicators. The proposed algorithm is able to learn sparse representations that correspond to the same dictionary atoms with the same sparsity but different values in coupled feature spaces, thus bringing consistent and accurate mapping between coupled feature spaces. Another advantage of the proposed method is that the number of dictionary atoms and their relative importance may be inferred non-parametrically.

<p>Author: Sumit Shekhar, Vishal M. Patel, Hien V. Nguyen, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: Data-driven dictionaries have produced state-of-the-art results in various classification tasks. However, when the target data has a different distribution than the source data, the learned sparse representation may not be optimal. In this paper, we investigate if it is possible to optimally represent both source and target by a common dictionary. Specifically, we describe a technique which jointly learns projections of data in the two domains, and a latent dictionary which can succinctly represent both the domains in the projected low-dimensional space. An efficient optimization technique is presented, which can be easily kernelized and extended to multiple domains. The algorithm is modified to learn a common discriminative dictionary, which can be further used for classification. The proposed approach does not require any explicit correspondence between the source and target domains, and shows good results even when there are only a few labels available in the target domain. Various recognition experiments show that the methodperforms onparor better than competitive stateof-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.18543293 <a title="204-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Structured_Low-Rank_Representations_for_Image_Classification.html">257 cvpr-2013-Learning Structured Low-Rank Representations for Image Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu-Tseh Chi, Mohsen Ali, Ajit Rajwade, Jeffrey Ho</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a dictionary learning framework that combines the proposed block/group (BGSC) or reconstructed block/group (R-BGSC) sparse coding schemes with the novel Intra-block Coherence Suppression Dictionary Learning (ICS-DL) algorithm. An important and distinguishing feature of the proposed framework is that all dictionary blocks are trained simultaneously with respect to each data group while the intra-block coherence being explicitly minimized as an important objective. We provide both empirical evidence and heuristic support for this feature that can be considered as a direct consequence of incorporating both the group structure for the input data and the block structure for the dictionary in the learning process. The optimization problems for both the dictionary learning and sparse coding can be solved efficiently using block-gradient descent, and the details of the optimization algorithms are presented. We evaluate the proposed methods using well-known datasets, and favorable comparisons with state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods demonstrate the viability and validity of the proposed framework.</p><p>4 0.79792869 <a title="204-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-level_Discriminative_Dictionary_Learning_towards_Hierarchical_Visual_Categorization.html">296 cvpr-2013-Multi-level Discriminative Dictionary Learning towards Hierarchical Visual Categorization</a></p>

<p>Author: Yangmuzi Zhang, Zhuolin Jiang, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: An approach to learn a structured low-rank representation for image classification is presented. We use a supervised learning method to construct a discriminative and reconstructive dictionary. By introducing an ideal regularization term, we perform low-rank matrix recovery for contaminated training data from all categories simultaneously without losing structural information. A discriminative low-rank representation for images with respect to the constructed dictionary is obtained. With semantic structure information and strong identification capability, this representation is good for classification tasks even using a simple linear multi-classifier. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>6 0.77948046 <a title="204-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Separable_Dictionary_Learning.html">392 cvpr-2013-Separable Dictionary Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Tianyang Ma, Longin Jan Latecki</p><p>Abstract: The proposed approach is based on standard graph transduction, semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Its key novelty is the integration of global connectivity constraints into this framework. Although connectivity leads to higher order constraints and their number is an exponential, finding the most violated connectivity constraint can be done efficiently in polynomial time. Moreover, each such constraint can be represented as a linear inequality. Based on this fact, we design a cutting-plane algorithm to solve the integrated problem. It iterates between solving a convex quadraticproblem of labelpropagation with linear inequality constraints, and finding the most violated constraint. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on a realistic and very challenging problem of cosegmentation of multiple foreground objects in photo collections in which the foreground objects are not present in all photos. The obtained results not only demonstrate performance boost induced by the connectivity constraints, but also show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>2 0.93679273 <a title="204-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Monocular_Template-Based_3D_Reconstruction_of_Extensible_Surfaces_with_Local_Linear_Elasticity.html">289 cvpr-2013-Monocular Template-Based 3D Reconstruction of Extensible Surfaces with Local Linear Elasticity</a></p>

We derive a patch-based formulation of this stretching energy by assuming local linear elasticity. This formulation unifies geometrical and mechanical constraints in a single energy term. We prevent local scale ambiguities by imposing a set of fixed boundary 3D points. We experimentally prove the sufficiency of this set of boundary points and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different developable and non-developable surfaces with a wide range of extensibility.</p><p>3 0.9333536 <a title="204-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploring_Implicit_Image_Statistics_for_Visual_Representativeness_Modeling.html">157 cvpr-2013-Exploring Implicit Image Statistics for Visual Representativeness Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoshuai Sun, Xin-Jing Wang, Hongxun Yao, Lei Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a computational model of visual representativeness by integrating cognitive theories of representativeness heuristics with computer vision and machine learning techniques. Unlike previous models that build their representativeness measure based on the visible data, our model takes the initial inputs as explicit positive reference and extend the measure by exploring the implicit negatives. Given a group of images that contains obvious visual concepts, we create a customized image ontology consisting of both positive and negative instances by mining the most related and confusable neighbors of the positive concept in ontological semantic knowledge bases. The representativeness of a new item is then determined by its likelihoods for both the positive and negative references. To ensure the effectiveness of probability inference as well as the cognitive plausibility, we discover the potential prototypes and treat them as an intermediate representation of semantic concepts. In the experiment, we evaluate the performance of representativeness models based on both human judgements and user-click logs of commercial image search engine. Experimental results on both ImageNet and image sets of general concepts demonstrate the superior performance of our model against the state-of-the-arts.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.90279096 <a title="204-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Histograms_of_Sparse_Codes_for_Object_Detection.html">204 cvpr-2013-Histograms of Sparse Codes for Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaofeng Ren, Deva Ramanan</p><p>Abstract: Object detection has seen huge progress in recent years, much thanks to the heavily-engineered Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. Can we go beyond gradients and do better than HOG? Weprovide an affirmative answer byproposing and investigating a sparse representation for object detection, Histograms of Sparse Codes (HSC). We compute sparse codes with dictionaries learned from data using K-SVD, and aggregate per-pixel sparse codes to form local histograms. We intentionally keep true to the sliding window framework (with mixtures and parts) and only change the underlying features. To keep training (and testing) efficient, we apply dimension reduction by computing SVD on learned models, and adopt supervised training where latent positions of roots and parts are given externally e.g. from a HOG-based detector. By learning and using local representations that are much more expressive than gradients, we demonstrate large improvements over the state of the art on the PASCAL benchmark for both root- only and part-based models.</p><p>5 0.90236467 <a title="204-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Pedestrian_Detection_with_Unsupervised_Multi-stage_Feature_Learning.html">328 cvpr-2013-Pedestrian Detection with Unsupervised Multi-stage Feature Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Sermanet, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Soumith Chintala, Yann Lecun</p><p>Abstract: Pedestrian detection is a problem of considerable practical interest. Adding to the list of successful applications of deep learning methods to vision, we report state-of-theart and competitive results on all major pedestrian datasets with a convolutional network model. The model uses a few new twists, such as multi-stage features, connections that skip layers to integrate global shape information with local distinctive motif information, and an unsupervised method based on convolutional sparse coding to pre-train the filters at each stage.</p><p>6 0.90143424 <a title="204-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Label_Trees_for_Efficient_Large_Scale_Image_Classification.html">340 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Label Trees for Efficient Large Scale Image Classification</a></p>

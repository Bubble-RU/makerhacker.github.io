<p>Author: Raviteja Vemulapalli, Jaishanker K. Pillai, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: In computer vision applications, features often lie on Riemannian manifolds with known geometry. Popular learning algorithms such as discriminant analysis, partial least squares, support vector machines, etc., are not directly applicable to such features due to the non-Euclidean nature of the underlying spaces. Hence, classification is often performed in an extrinsic manner by mapping the manifolds to Euclidean spaces using kernels. However, for kernel based approaches, poor choice of kernel often results in reduced performance. In this paper, we address the issue of kernelselection for the classification of features that lie on Riemannian manifolds using the kernel learning approach. We propose two criteria for jointly learning the kernel and the classifier using a single optimization problem. Specifically, for the SVM classifier, we formulate the problem of learning a good kernel-classifier combination as a convex optimization problem and solve it efficiently following the multiple kernel learning approach. Experimental results on image set-based classification and activity recognition clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods for classification of manifold features.</p><p>3 0.20972705 <a title="259-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-rigid_Structure_from_Motion_with_Diffusion_Maps_Prior.html">306 cvpr-2013-Non-rigid Structure from Motion with Diffusion Maps Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Lili Tao, Bogdan J. Matuszewski</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach based on a non-linear manifold learning technique is proposed to recover 3D nonrigid structures from 2D image sequences captured by a single camera. Most ofthe existing approaches assume that 3D shapes can be accurately modelled in a linear subspace. These techniques perform well when the deformations are relatively small or simple, but fail when more complex deformations need to be recovered. The non-linear deformations are often observed in highly flexible objects for which the use of the linear model is impractical. A specific type of shape variations might be governed by only a small number of parameters, therefore can be wellrepresented in a low dimensional manifold. We learn a nonlinear shape prior using diffusion maps method. The key contribution in this paper is the introduction of the shape prior that constrain the reconstructed shapes to lie in the learned manifold. The proposed methodology has been validated quantitatively and qualitatively on 2D points sequences projected from the 3D motion capture data and real 2D video sequences. The comparisons oftheproposed man- ifold based method against several state-of-the-art techniques are shown on different types of deformable objects.</p><p>4 0.20456535 <a title="259-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Rolling_Riemannian_Manifolds_to_Solve_the_Multi-class_Classification_Problem.html">367 cvpr-2013-Rolling Riemannian Manifolds to Solve the Multi-class Classification Problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Caseiro, Pedro Martins, João F. Henriques, Fátima Silva Leite, Jorge Batista</p><p>Abstract: In the past few years there has been a growing interest on geometric frameworks to learn supervised classification models on Riemannian manifolds [31, 27]. A popular framework, valid over any Riemannian manifold, was proposed in [31] for binary classification. Once moving from binary to multi-class classification thisparadigm is not valid anymore, due to the spread of multiple positive classes on the manifold [27]. It is then natural to ask whether the multi-class paradigm could be extended to operate on a large class of Riemannian manifolds. We propose a mathematically well-founded classification paradigm that allows to extend the work in [31] to multi-class models, taking into account the structure of the space. The idea is to project all the data from the manifold onto an affine tangent space at a particular point. To mitigate the distortion induced by local diffeomorphisms, we introduce for the first time in the computer vision community a well-founded mathematical concept, so-called Rolling map [21, 16]. The novelty in this alternate school of thought is that the manifold will be firstly rolled (without slipping or twisting) as a rigid body, then the given data is unwrapped onto the affine tangent space, where the classification is performed.</p><p>5 0.19209069 <a title="259-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Sparse_Subspace_Denoising_for_Image_Manifolds.html">405 cvpr-2013-Sparse Subspace Denoising for Image Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Wang, Zhuowen Tu</p><p>Abstract: With the increasing availability of high dimensional data and demand in sophisticated data analysis algorithms, manifold learning becomes a critical technique to perform dimensionality reduction, unraveling the intrinsic data structure. The real-world data however often come with noises and outliers; seldom, all the data live in a single linear subspace. Inspired by the recent advances in sparse subspace learning and diffusion-based approaches, we propose a new manifold denoising algorithm in which data neighborhoods are adaptively inferred via sparse subspace reconstruction; we then derive a new formulation to perform denoising to the original data. Experiments carried out on both toy and real applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method; it is insensitive to parameter tuning and we show significant improvement over the competing algorithms.</p><p>6 0.17400698 <a title="259-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Top-Down_Segmentation_of_Non-rigid_Visual_Objects_Using_Derivative-Based_Search_on_Sparse_Manifolds.html">433 cvpr-2013-Top-Down Segmentation of Non-rigid Visual Objects Using Derivative-Based Search on Sparse Manifolds</a></p>

<p>Author: Amr Bakry, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a challenging problem, due to confusion between visual speech features. The speaker identification problem is usually coupled with speech recognition. Moreover, speaker identification is important to several applications, such as automatic access control, biometrics, authentication, and personal privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for lipreading and speaker identification. Wepropose a new approachfor manifold parameterization in a low-dimensional latent space, where each manifold is represented as a point in that space. We initially parameterize each instance manifold using a nonlinear mapping from a unified manifold representation. We then factorize the parameter space using Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) to achieve a low-dimension manifold latent space. We use two-way projections to achieve two manifold latent spaces, one for the speech content and one for the speaker. We apply our approach on two public databases: AVLetters and OuluVS. We show the results for three different settings of lipreading: speaker independent, speaker dependent, and speaker semi-dependent. Our approach outperforms for the speaker semi-dependent setting by at least 15% of the baseline, and competes in the other two settings.</p><p>4 0.79883397 <a title="259-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Kernel_Learning_for_Extrinsic_Classification_of_Manifold_Features.html">237 cvpr-2013-Kernel Learning for Extrinsic Classification of Manifold Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices have become popular to encode image information. Accounting for the geometry of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices has proven key to the success of many algorithms. However, most existing methods only approximate the true shape of the manifold locally by its tangent plane. In this paper, inspired by kernel methods, we propose to map SPD matrices to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To encode the geometry of the manifold in the mapping, we introduce a family of provably positive definite kernels on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. These kernels are derived from the Gaussian kernel, but exploit different metrics on the manifold. This lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM and kernel PCA, to the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the problems of pedestrian detection, object categorization, texture analysis, 2D motion segmentation and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) segmentation.</p><p>6 0.66513306 <a title="259-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Sparse_Subspace_Denoising_for_Image_Manifolds.html">405 cvpr-2013-Sparse Subspace Denoising for Image Manifolds</a></p>

<p>Author: Shihui Ying, Guorong Wu, Qian Wang, Dinggang Shen</p><p>Abstract: Recently, groupwise registration has been investigated for simultaneous alignment of all images without selecting any individual image as the template, thus avoiding the potential bias in image registration. However, none of current groupwise registration method fully utilizes the image distribution to guide the registration. Thus, the registration performance usually suffers from large inter-subject variations across individual images. To solve this issue, we propose a novel groupwise registration algorithm for large population dataset, guided by the image distribution on the manifold. Specifically, we first use a graph to model the distribution of all image data sitting on the image manifold, with each node representing an image and each edge representing the geodesic pathway between two nodes (or images). Then, the procedure of warping all images to theirpopulation center turns to the dynamic shrinking ofthe graph nodes along their graph edges until all graph nodes become close to each other. Thus, the topology ofimage distribution on the image manifold is always preserved during the groupwise registration. More importantly, by modeling , the distribution of all images via a graph, we can potentially reduce registration error since every time each image is warped only according to its nearby images with similar structures in the graph. We have evaluated our proposed groupwise registration method on both synthetic and real datasets, with comparison to the two state-of-the-art groupwise registration methods. All experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of registration accuracy and robustness.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.77035123 <a title="259-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_a_Manifold_as_an_Atlas.html">259 cvpr-2013-Learning a Manifold as an Atlas</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikolaos Pitelis, Chris Russell, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we return to the underlying mathematical definition of a manifold and directly characterise learning a manifold as finding an atlas, or a set of overlapping charts, that accurately describe local structure. We formulate the problem of learning the manifold as an optimisation that simultaneously refines the continuous parameters defining the charts, and the discrete assignment of points to charts. In contrast to existing methods, this direct formulation of a manifold does not require “unwrapping ” the manifold into a lower dimensional space and allows us to learn closed manifolds of interest to vision, such as those corresponding to gait cycles or camera pose. We report state-ofthe-art results for manifold based nearest neighbour classification on vision datasets, and show how the same techniques can be applied to the 3D reconstruction of human motion from a single image.</p><p>3 0.7335884 <a title="259-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Blur_Processing_Using_Double_Discrete_Wavelet_Transform.html">68 cvpr-2013-Blur Processing Using Double Discrete Wavelet Transform</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Keigo Hirakawa</p><p>Abstract: We propose a notion of double discrete wavelet transform (DDWT) that is designed to sparsify the blurred image and the blur kernel simultaneously. DDWT greatly enhances our ability to analyze, detect, and process blur kernels and blurry images—the proposed framework handles both global and spatially varying blur kernels seamlessly, and unifies the treatment of blur caused by object motion, optical defocus, and camera shake. To illustrate the potential of DDWT in computer vision and image processing, we develop example applications in blur kernel estimation, deblurring, and near-blur-invariant image feature extraction.</p><p>4 0.70853502 <a title="259-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Measuring_Crowd_Collectiveness.html">282 cvpr-2013-Measuring Crowd Collectiveness</a></p>
<p>Author: Bolei Zhou, Xiaoou Tang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Collective motions are common in crowd systems and have attracted a great deal of attention in a variety of multidisciplinary fields. Collectiveness, which indicates the degree of individuals acting as a union in collective motion, is a fundamental and universal measurement for various crowd systems. By integrating path similarities among crowds on collective manifold, this paper proposes a descriptor of collectiveness and an efficient computation for the crowd and its constituent individuals. The algorithm of the Collective Merging is then proposed to detect collective motions from random motions. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed collectiveness descriptor on the system of self-driven particles. We then compare the collectiveness descriptor to human perception for collective motion and show high consistency. Our experiments regarding the detection of collective motions and the measurement of collectiveness in videos of pedestrian crowds and bacteria colony demonstrate a wide range of applications of the collectiveness descriptor1.</p><p>5 0.70575452 <a title="259-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploiting_the_Power_of_Stereo_Confidences.html">155 cvpr-2013-Exploiting the Power of Stereo Confidences</a></p>
<p>Author: David Pfeiffer, Stefan Gehrig, Nicolai Schneider</p><p>Abstract: Applications based on stereo vision are becoming increasingly common, ranging from gaming over robotics to driver assistance. While stereo algorithms have been investigated heavily both on the pixel and the application level, far less attention has been dedicated to the use of stereo confidence cues. Mostly, a threshold is applied to the confidence values for further processing, which is essentially a sparsified disparity map. This is straightforward but it does not take full advantage of the available information. In this paper, we make full use of the stereo confidence cues by propagating all confidence values along with the measured disparities in a Bayesian manner. Before using this information, a mapping from confidence values to disparity outlier probability rate is performed based on gathered disparity statistics from labeled video data. We present an extension of the so called Stixel World, a generic 3D intermediate representation that can serve as input for many of the applications mentioned above. This scheme is modified to directly exploit stereo confidence cues in the underlying sensor model during a maximum a poste- riori estimation process. The effectiveness of this step is verified in an in-depth evaluation on a large real-world traffic data base of which parts are made publicly available. We show that using stereo confidence cues allows both reducing the number of false object detections by a factor of six while keeping the detection rate at a near constant level.</p><p>6 0.67056865 <a title="259-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Deep_Convolutional_Network_Cascade_for_Facial_Point_Detection.html">104 cvpr-2013-Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection</a></p>

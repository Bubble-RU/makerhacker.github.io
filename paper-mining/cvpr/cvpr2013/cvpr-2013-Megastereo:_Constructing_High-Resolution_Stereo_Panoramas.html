<p>Author: Yinda Zhang, Jianxiong Xiao, James Hays, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We significantly extrapolate the field of view of a photograph by learning from a roughly aligned, wide-angle guide image of the same scene category. Our method can extrapolate typical photos into complete panoramas. The extrapolation problem is formulated in the shift-map image synthesis framework. We analyze the self-similarity of the guide image to generate a set of allowable local transformations and apply them to the input image. Our guided shift-map method preserves to the scene layout of the guide image when extrapolating a photograph. While conventional shiftmap methods only support translations, this is not expressive enough to characterize the self-similarity of complex scenes. Therefore we additionally allow image transformations of rotation, scaling and reflection. To handle this in- crease in complexity, we introduce a hierarchical graph optimization method to choose the optimal transformation at each output pixel. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of indoor, outdoor, natural, and man-made scenes.</p><p>3 0.20025253 <a title="283-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-As-Projective-As-Possible_Image_Stitching_with_Moving_DLT.html">47 cvpr-2013-As-Projective-As-Possible Image Stitching with Moving DLT</a></p>
<p>Author: Julio Zaragoza, Tat-Jun Chin, Michael S. Brown, David Suter</p><p>Abstract: We investigate projective estimation under model inadequacies, i.e., when the underpinning assumptions oftheprojective model are not fully satisfied by the data. We focus on the task of image stitching which is customarily solved by estimating a projective warp — a model that is justified when the scene is planar or when the views differ purely by rotation. Such conditions are easily violated in practice, and this yields stitching results with ghosting artefacts that necessitate the usage of deghosting algorithms. To this end we propose as-projective-as-possible warps, i.e., warps that aim to be globally projective, yet allow local non-projective deviations to account for violations to the assumed imaging conditions. Based on a novel estimation technique called Moving Direct Linear Transformation (Moving DLT), our method seamlessly bridges image regions that are inconsistent with the projective model. The result is highly accurate image stitching, with significantly reduced ghosting effects, thus lowering the dependency on post hoc deghosting.</p><p>4 0.18357441 <a title="283-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Globally_Consistent_Multi-label_Assignment_on_the_Ray_Space_of_4D_Light_Fields.html">188 cvpr-2013-Globally Consistent Multi-label Assignment on the Ray Space of 4D Light Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Sven Wanner, Christoph Straehle, Bastian Goldluecke</p><p>Abstract: Wepresent thefirst variationalframeworkfor multi-label segmentation on the ray space of 4D light fields. For traditional segmentation of single images, , features need to be extractedfrom the 2Dprojection ofa three-dimensional scene. The associated loss of geometry information can cause severe problems, for example if different objects have a very similar visual appearance. In this work, we show that using a light field instead of an image not only enables to train classifiers which can overcome many of these problems, but also provides an optimal data structure for label optimization by implicitly providing scene geometry information. It is thus possible to consistently optimize label assignment over all views simultaneously. As a further contribution, we make all light fields available online with complete depth and segmentation ground truth data where available, and thus establish the first benchmark data set for light field analysis to facilitate competitive further development of algorithms.</p><p>5 0.17020039 <a title="283-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Can_a_Fully_Unconstrained_Imaging_Model_Be_Applied_Effectively_to_Central_Cameras%3F.html">76 cvpr-2013-Can a Fully Unconstrained Imaging Model Be Applied Effectively to Central Cameras?</a></p>
<p>Author: Filippo Bergamasco, Andrea Albarelli, Emanuele Rodolà, Andrea Torsello</p><p>Abstract: Traditional camera models are often the result of a compromise between the ability to account for non-linearities in the image formation model and the need for a feasible number of degrees of freedom in the estimation process. These considerations led to the definition of several ad hoc models that best adapt to different imaging devices, ranging from pinhole cameras with no radial distortion to the more complex catadioptric or polydioptric optics. In this paper we dai s .unive . it ence points in the scene with their projections on the image plane [5]. Unfortunately, no real camera behaves exactly like an ideal pinhole. In fact, in most cases, at least the distortion effects introduced by the lens should be accounted for [19]. Any pinhole-based model, regardless of its level of sophistication, is geometrically unable to properly describe cameras exhibiting a frustum angle that is near or above 180 degrees. For wide-angle cameras, several different para- metric models have been proposed. Some of them try to modify the captured image in order to follow the original propose the use of an unconstrained model even in standard central camera settings dominated by the pinhole model, and introduce a novel calibration approach that can deal effectively with the huge number of free parameters associated with it, resulting in a higher precision calibration than what is possible with the standard pinhole model with correction for radial distortion. This effectively extends the use of general models to settings that traditionally have been ruled by parametric approaches out of practical considerations. The benefit of such an unconstrained model to quasipinhole central cameras is supported by an extensive experimental validation.</p><p>6 0.145522 <a title="283-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-City-Scale_Change_Detection_in_Cadastral_3D_Models_Using_Images.html">81 cvpr-2013-City-Scale Change Detection in Cadastral 3D Models Using Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Donald G. Dansereau, Oscar Pizarro, Stefan B. Williams</p><p>Abstract: Plenoptic cameras are gaining attention for their unique light gathering and post-capture processing capabilities. We describe a decoding, calibration and rectification procedurefor lenselet-basedplenoptic cameras appropriatefor a range of computer vision applications. We derive a novel physically based 4D intrinsic matrix relating each recorded pixel to its corresponding ray in 3D space. We further propose a radial distortion model and a practical objective function based on ray reprojection. Our 15-parameter camera model is of much lower dimensionality than camera array models, and more closely represents the physics of lenselet-based cameras. Results include calibration of a commercially available camera using three calibration grid sizes over five datasets. Typical RMS ray reprojection errors are 0.0628, 0.105 and 0.363 mm for 3.61, 7.22 and 35.1 mm calibration grids, respectively. Rectification examples include calibration targets and real-world imagery.</p><p>4 0.71818453 <a title="283-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Manhattan_Scene_Understanding_via_XSlit_Imaging.html">279 cvpr-2013-Manhattan Scene Understanding via XSlit Imaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinwei Ye, Yu Ji, Jingyi Yu</p><p>Abstract: A Manhattan World (MW) [3] is composed of planar surfaces and parallel lines aligned with three mutually orthogonal principal axes. Traditional MW understanding algorithms rely on geometry priors such as the vanishing points and reference (ground) planes for grouping coplanar structures. In this paper, we present a novel single-image MW reconstruction algorithm from the perspective of nonpinhole cameras. We show that by acquiring the MW using an XSlit camera, we can instantly resolve coplanarity ambiguities. Specifically, we prove that parallel 3D lines map to 2D curves in an XSlit image and they converge at an XSlit Vanishing Point (XVP). In addition, if the lines are coplanar, their curved images will intersect at a second common pixel that we call Coplanar Common Point (CCP). CCP is a unique image feature in XSlit cameras that does not exist in pinholes. We present a comprehensive theory to analyze XVPs and CCPs in a MW scene and study how to recover 3D geometry in a complex MW scene from XVPs and CCPs. Finally, we build a prototype XSlit camera by using two layers of cylindrical lenses. Experimental results × on both synthetic and real data show that our new XSlitcamera-based solution provides an effective and reliable solution for MW understanding.</p><p>5 0.70708257 <a title="283-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Principal_Observation_Ray_Calibration_for_Tiled-Lens-Array_Integral_Imaging_Display.html">337 cvpr-2013-Principal Observation Ray Calibration for Tiled-Lens-Array Integral Imaging Display</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiming Li, Haitao Wang, Mingcai Zhou, Shandong Wang, Shaohui Jiao, Xing Mei, Tao Hong, Hoyoung Lee, Jiyeun Kim</p><p>Abstract: Integral imaging display (IID) is a promising technology to provide realistic 3D image without glasses. To achieve a large screen IID with a reasonable fabrication cost, a potential solution is a tiled-lens-array IID (TLA-IID). However, TLA-IIDs are subject to 3D image artifacts when there are even slight misalignments between the lens arrays. This work aims at compensating these artifacts by calibrating the lens array poses with a camera and including them in a ray model used for rendering the 3D image. Since the lens arrays are transparent, this task is challenging for traditional calibration methods. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration method based on defining a set of principle observation rays that pass lens centers of the TLA and the camera ’s optical center. The method is able to determine the lens array poses with only one camera at an arbitrary unknown position without using any additional markers. The principle observation rays are automatically extracted using a structured light based method from a dense correspondence map between the displayed and captured . pixels. . com, Experiments show that lens array misalignments xme i nlpr . ia . ac . cn @ can be estimated with a standard deviation smaller than 0.4 pixels. Based on this, 3D image artifacts are shown to be effectively removed in a test TLA-IID with challenging misalignments.</p><p>6 0.6930576 <a title="283-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Radial_Distortion_Self-Calibration.html">344 cvpr-2013-Radial Distortion Self-Calibration</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Richardt, Yael Pritch, Henning Zimmer, Alexander Sorkine-Hornung</p><p>Abstract: We present a solution for generating high-quality stereo panoramas at megapixel resolutions. While previous approaches introduced the basic principles, we show that those techniques do not generalise well to today’s high image resolutions and lead to disturbing visual artefacts. As our first contribution, we describe the necessary correction steps and a compact representation for the input images in order to achieve a highly accurate approximation to the required ray space. Our second contribution is a flow-based upsampling of the available input rays which effectively resolves known aliasing issues like stitching artefacts. The required rays are generated on the fly to perfectly match the desired output resolution, even for small numbers of input images. In addition, the upsampling is real-time and enables direct interactive control over the desired stereoscopic depth effect. In combination, our contributions allow the generation of stereoscopic panoramas at high output resolutions that are virtually free of artefacts such as seams, stereo discontinuities, vertical parallax and other mono-/stereoscopic shape distortions. Our process is robust, and other types of multiperspective panoramas, such as linear panoramas, can also benefit from our contributions. We show various comparisons and high-resolution results.</p><p>2 0.80232638 <a title="283-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Image_Tag_Completion_via_Image-Specific_and_Tag-Specific_Linear_Sparse_Reconstructions.html">213 cvpr-2013-Image Tag Completion via Image-Specific and Tag-Specific Linear Sparse Reconstructions</a></p>
<p>Author: Zijia Lin, Guiguang Ding, Mingqing Hu, Jianmin Wang, Xiaojun Ye</p><p>Abstract: Though widely utilized for facilitating image management, user-provided image tags are usually incomplete and insufficient to describe the whole semantic content of corresponding images, resulting in performance degradations in tag-dependent applications and thus necessitating effective tag completion methods. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme denoted as LSR for automatic image tag completion via image-specific and tag-specific Linear Sparse Reconstructions. Given an incomplete initial tagging matrix with each row representing an image and each column representing a tag, LSR optimally reconstructs each image (i.e. row) and each tag (i.e. column) with remaining ones under constraints of sparsity, considering imageimage similarity, image-tag association and tag-tag concurrence. Then both image-specific and tag-specific reconstruction values are normalized and merged for selecting missing related tags. Extensive experiments conducted on both benchmark dataset and web images well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LSR.</p><p>3 0.7678535 <a title="283-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-In_Defense_of_3D-Label_Stereo.html">219 cvpr-2013-In Defense of 3D-Label Stereo</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Olsson, Johannes Ulén, Yuri Boykov</p><p>Abstract: It is commonly believed that higher order smoothness should be modeled using higher order interactions. For example, 2nd order derivatives for deformable (active) contours are represented by triple cliques. Similarly, the 2nd order regularization methods in stereo predominantly use MRF models with scalar (1D) disparity labels and triple clique interactions. In this paper we advocate a largely overlooked alternative approach to stereo where 2nd order surface smoothness is represented by pairwise interactions with 3D-labels, e.g. tangent planes. This general paradigm has been criticized due to perceived computational complexity of optimization in higher-dimensional label space. Contrary to popular beliefs, we demonstrate that representing 2nd order surface smoothness with 3D labels leads to simpler optimization problems with (nearly) submodular pairwise interactions. Our theoretical and experimental re- sults demonstrate advantages over state-of-the-art methods for 2nd order smoothness stereo. 1</p><p>4 0.72881228 <a title="283-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Minimum_Uncertainty_Gap_for_Robust_Visual_Tracking.html">285 cvpr-2013-Minimum Uncertainty Gap for Robust Visual Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Junseok Kwon, Kyoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel tracking algorithm that robustly tracks the target by finding the state which minimizes uncertainty of the likelihood at current state. The uncertainty of the likelihood is estimated by obtaining the gap between the lower and upper bounds of the likelihood. By minimizing the gap between the two bounds, our method finds the confident and reliable state of the target. In the paper, the state that gives the Minimum Uncertainty Gap (MUG) between likelihood bounds is shown to be more reliable than the state which gives the maximum likelihood only, especially when there are severe illumination changes, occlusions, and pose variations. A rigorous derivation of the lower and upper bounds of the likelihood for the visual tracking problem is provided to address this issue. Additionally, an efficient inference algorithm using Interacting Markov Chain Monte Carlo is presented to find the best state that maximizes the average of the lower and upper bounds of the likelihood and minimizes the gap between two bounds simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully tracks the target in realistic videos and outperforms conventional tracking methods.</p><p>5 0.72867125 <a title="283-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Monocular_Epipolar_Flow_Estimation.html">362 cvpr-2013-Robust Monocular Epipolar Flow Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Koichiro Yamaguchi, David McAllester, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of computing optical flow in monocular video taken from a moving vehicle. In this setting, the vast majority of image flow is due to the vehicle ’s ego-motion. We propose to take advantage of this fact and estimate flow along the epipolar lines of the egomotion. Towards this goal, we derive a slanted-plane MRF model which explicitly reasons about the ordering of planes and their physical validity at junctions. Furthermore, we present a bottom-up grouping algorithm which produces over-segmentations that respect flow boundaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the challenging KITTI flow benchmark [11] achieving half the error of the best competing general flow algorithm and one third of the error of the best epipolar flow algorithm.</p><p>6 0.72686636 <a title="283-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Lagrangian_Relaxation_to_Min-cost_Network_Flow.html">300 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow</a></p>

</p><p>8 Introduction Discrete energy minimization problems, in the form of factor graphs, or equivalently Markov or Conditional Random Field models (MRF/CRF) are a mainstay of computer vision research. [sent-17, score-0.237]
</p><p>9 [33] conducted a comparative study on 4-connected MRF models. [sent-20, score-0.108]
</p><p>10 Taken together, these changes give rise to hard energy minimization problems that are fundamentally different than the ones considered by Szeliski et al. [sent-25, score-0.171]
</p><p>11 In particular, in [33]  the models were restricted to 4-connected grid graphs with unary and pairwise factors only. [sent-26, score-0.272]
</p><p>12 We provide a modernized comparison, updating both the problem instances and the inference techniques. [sent-28, score-0.254]
</p><p>13 factor order up to 300, (2) models on “regular” graphs with a denser connectivity structure, e. [sent-31, score-0.188]
</p><p>14 27-pixel neighborhood, or models on “irregular” graphs with spatially non-uniform connectivity structure, (3) models based on superpixels with smaller number of variables, and (4) image partitioning models without unary terms, an unknown number of classes. [sent-33, score-0.386]
</p><p>15 The study [33] compared the performance of the state of the art at the time, represented by primal move-making methods, loopy belief propagation, a tree-reweighted belief propagation variant, and a set of more traditional local optimization heuristics like iterated conditional modes (ICM). [sent-35, score-0.136]
</p><p>16 In addition, we add a new class of polyhedral methods, which solve an underlying (Integer) Linear Programming formulation (LP/ILP). [sent-40, score-0.202]
</p><p>17 1 1 13 3 32 2 268 6  Contributions We provide a modernized, follow-up study of [33] with the following aspects: (i) A broad collection of state-of-the-art models and inference methods. [sent-41, score-0.255]
</p><p>18 (ii) All models and inference techniques were wrapped into a uniform software framework, OpenGM2 [2], for reproducible benchmarking. [sent-42, score-0.213]
</p><p>19 (iv) We enable researchers to experiment with recent state-of-the-art inference methods on their own models. [sent-45, score-0.112]
</p><p>20 Related Inference Studies Apart from the study [33], there are many recent articles in computer vision which compare inference techniques for a small specialized class of models, such as [4, 27, 25]. [sent-46, score-0.254]
</p><p>21 Unfortunately, the models and/or inference techniques are often not publicly available. [sent-47, score-0.179]
</p><p>22 It compares several variants of message passing and move making algorithms for higher order models. [sent-50, score-0.165]
</p><p>23 In contrast to this work, polyhedral inference methods are not included and only a small number of synthetic models are used. [sent-51, score-0.351]
</p><p>24 Key Insights and Suggested Future Research In comparison with [33], perhaps the most important new insight is that recent, advanced polyhedral LP and ILP solvers are relevant for a wide range of problems in computer vision. [sent-54, score-0.344]
</p><p>25 This is true for problems with a small number of labels, variables and factors of low order that have a simple form. [sent-57, score-0.195]
</p><p>26 But even for some problems with a large number of variables or complex factor form, specialized ILP and LP solvers can be applied successfully. [sent-58, score-0.315]
</p><p>27 For problems with many variables for which the LP relaxation is not tight, polyhedral methods are not competitive. [sent-59, score-0.376]
</p><p>28 Second, our findings suggest that further investigation in improving the efficient and applicability of ILP and LP solvers is warranted. [sent-65, score-0.122]
</p><p>29 Models We assume that our discrete energy minimization problem is given in the form of a factor graph G = (V, F, E), a  ×  bipartite graph, with a set of variable nodes V, a the set of all factors F, and a set E ⊂ V F that defines the relation between those [23]. [sent-70, score-0.379]
</p><p>30 TheE va ⊂ri aVbl ×e xa assigned to the variable node a ∈ V lives in a discrete label-space Xa and each factor f ∈ Fa h∈a sV an associated function ϕf : Xne(f) → R, where xne(f) are the variables in the neighborhood ne(→f) R := {v ∈ V : (v, f) ∈ E} of the factor f, i. [sent-71, score-0.29]
</p><p>31 pairwise factors have order 2, and the order of a model by the maximal degree among all factors. [sent-76, score-0.125]
</p><p>32 The energy function of the discrete labeling problem is then given as  J(x)  = ? [sent-77, score-0.124]
</p><p>33 } It is worth to note that we use factor graph models instead of Markov Random Field models (MRFs), also known as undirected graphical models. [sent-85, score-0.253]
</p><p>34 average numbers of factors per node, mean degree of factors, or structure of the graph, e. [sent-101, score-0.139]
</p><p>35 Finally, the properties/type of the functions embodied by the factors are of interest, since for some subclasses specialized optimization methods exists, e. [sent-104, score-0.147]
</p><p>36 Note, some models have a single instance, while others have a larger set of instances which allows to derive some statistics. [sent-110, score-0.17]
</p><p>37 For 2D images, where variables are associated to pixels in a 2D lattice, a simple form of a factor graph model connects each pixel with its four nearest neighbors using a pairwise energy. [sent-115, score-0.181]
</p><p>38 In our study we incorporated the models mrf-stereo, mrf-inpainting, and mrf-photomontage from [33]. [sent-117, score-0.143]
</p><p>39 Therefore, models with denser structures (both regular and irregular) as well as higher order models have been introduced in the last decade. [sent-126, score-0.13]
</p><p>40 (a) image(b) superpixels(c) MCA Figure 2: Example for a superpixel partition model [6]: image (left), superpixels (middle) and segmentation (right). [sent-136, score-0.2]
</p><p>41 Although each variable has only two labels, their regional sparse neighborhood structure makes the resulting inference problem challenging, c. [sent-139, score-0.121]
</p><p>42 Superpixel-Based Partition Models Beyond classical superpixel models, this study also considers a recent class of superpixel models [22, 6, 9, 10] which aim at partitioning an image without any class-specific knowledge, i. [sent-148, score-0.285]
</p><p>43 Since the partition into isolated superpixels is a feasible solution, the label space of each variable is equal to the number of variables of the model, and therefore typically very large, c. [sent-151, score-0.227]
</p><p>44 State-of-the-art solvers for classical models either are inapplicable or perform poorly on these models [19]. [sent-155, score-0.223]
</p><p>45 The hyper-graph image segmentation dataset correlationclustering [22] includes higher order terms that favor equal labels for superpixels in their scope if those are visually similar. [sent-168, score-0.139]
</p><p>46 The probabilistic image partition dataset image-seg [6] contains factors between pairs of superpixels. [sent-169, score-0.138]
</p><p>47 Other Models Our benchmark includes two models in which neither pixels nor superpixels are used. [sent-171, score-0.141]
</p><p>48 In this case the models include no unary terms, whereas the pairwise terms penalize the geometric distortion between pairs of points. [sent-174, score-0.147]
</p><p>49 Polyhedral and Combinatorial Methods A large class of algorithms solves a linear programming relaxation (LP) of the discrete energy minimization problem. [sent-184, score-0.241]
</p><p>50 Perhaps the most commonly used relaxation is the LP relaxation over the local polytope. [sent-185, score-0.128]
</p><p>51 For large problems this is no longer possible and special solvers have been proposed that optimize a dual formulation of the problem. [sent-189, score-0.142]
</p><p>52 In both cases primal integer solutions are reconstructed from the subgradients. [sent-192, score-0.158]
</p><p>53 Related to polyhedral methods are Integer Linear Programs (ILPs). [sent-193, score-0.202]
</p><p>54 Solutions of ILPs are found by solving a sequence of LPs and either adding additional constraints to the polytope (cutting plane techniques), or branching the polytope into several polytopes (branchand-bound techniques). [sent-195, score-0.236]
</p><p>55 This multicut solver (MCA) can only be applied for functions which includes terms that are either invariant under label permutations or of first-order. [sent-199, score-0.127]
</p><p>56 We also consider a relaxed multicut version [22] (MCR) only applicable to partition problems, and a max-cut solver (MCBC) for pairwise binary problems. [sent-201, score-0.19]
</p><p>57 Polyhedral methods can often be reformulated as a message passing method, e. [sent-203, score-0.165]
</p><p>58 Also its non-sequential version TRBP [34] can be written as a message passing algorithm. [sent-206, score-0.165]
</p><p>59 Maybe the most popular message passing algorithm is loopy belief propagation (LBP). [sent-209, score-0.165]
</p><p>60 For general second-order binary models, QPBO [32] solves the LP relaxation over the local polytope and provides a persistence certificate. [sent-216, score-0.182]
</p><p>61 An3Here we consider spanning trees as subproblems such that the relaxation is equivalent to the local polytope relaxation. [sent-217, score-0.182]
</p><p>62 We also consider a generalization of α-Expansion for general problems and higher order factors known as α-Fusion (FUSION), which fusion-moves and the order-reduction of  Fix et al. [sent-221, score-0.134]
</p><p>63 Furthermore, the use of a common platform provides a uniform representation of models, as well as a file format that is sufficiently general to store all models in this study with affordable file sizes. [sent-232, score-0.221]
</p><p>64 All models used in this study will be made available in the OpenGM2 file format. [sent-233, score-0.182]
</p><p>65 During optimization we store the value of the current integer solution and the lower bound after each iteration, if applicable. [sent-241, score-0.141]
</p><p>66 Specifically, some solvers are specialized implementations for a certain class of problems (e. [sent-259, score-0.249]
</p><p>67 Due to the algorithmic complexity we expect a speedup of ∼ 100 for specialized implementations of methods with prefix ogm, all other methods should be comparable. [sent-265, score-0.141]
</p><p>68 For difficult models like dtfchinesechar and matching, the exact solution is significantly better than approximate ones, both in terms of energy and quality. [sent-268, score-0.162]
</p><p>69 We also mention that even when they are not the fastest, message passing, polyhedral, and exact polyhedral methods often provide very good results quickly, and then spend most of the time to verify optimality or achieve a stopping criterion. [sent-271, score-0.438]
</p><p>70 We report runtime (mean runtime), objective value achieved by the final integer solution (mean value), and lower bound achieved (mean bound). [sent-276, score-0.218]

<p>Author: Jörg Hendrik Kappes, Markus Speth, Gerhard Reinelt, Christoph Schnörr</p><p>Abstract: Discrete graphical models (also known as discrete Markov random fields) are a major conceptual tool to model the structure of optimization problems in computer vision. While in the last decade research has focused on fast approximative methods, algorithms that provide globally optimal solutions have come more into the research focus in the last years. However, large scale computer vision problems seemed to be out of reach for such methods. In this paper we introduce a promising way to bridge this gap based on partial optimality and structural properties of the underlying problem factorization. Combining these preprocessing steps, we are able to solve grids of size 2048 2048 in less than 90 seconds.

<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>4 0.12069701 <a title="6-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Spatial_Inference_Machines.html">406 cvpr-2013-Spatial Inference Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Roman Shapovalov, Dmitry Vetrov, Pushmeet Kohli</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds. We extend the inference machines framework of Ross et al. by adding spatial factors that model mid-range and long-range dependencies inherent in the data. The new model is able to account for semantic spatial context. During training, our method automatically isolates and retains factors modelling spatial dependencies between variables that are relevant for achieving higher prediction accuracy. We evaluate the proposed method by using it to predict 1 7-category semantic segmentations on sets of stitched Kinect scans. Experimental results show that the spatial dependencies learned by our method significantly improve the accuracy of segmentation. They also show that our method outperforms the existing segmentation technique of Koppula et al.</p><p>5 0.12016556 <a title="6-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Cross-Domain_Information_Transfer_for_Location_Recognition_and_Clustering.html">250 cvpr-2013-Learning Cross-Domain Information Transfer for Location Recognition and Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Raghuraman Gopalan</p><p>Abstract: Estimating geographic location from images is a challenging problem that is receiving recent attention. In contrast to many existing methods that primarily model discriminative information corresponding to different locations, we propose joint learning of information that images across locations share and vary upon. Starting with generative and discriminative subspaces pertaining to domains, which are obtained by a hierarchical grouping of images from adjacent locations, we present a top-down approach that first models cross-domain information transfer by utilizing the geometry ofthese subspaces, and then encodes the model results onto individual images to infer their location. We report competitive results for location recognition and clustering on two public datasets, im2GPS and San Francisco, and empirically validate the utility of various design choices involved in the approach.</p><p>6 0.1187699 <a title="6-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Universality_of_the_Local_Marginal_Polytope.html">448 cvpr-2013-Universality of the Local Marginal Polytope</a></p>

This study provided valuable insights in choosing the best optimization technique for certain classes of problems. While these insights remain generally useful today, the phenominal success of random field models means that the kinds of inference problems we solve have changed significantly.

Key insights from our study agree with the results of Szeliski et al. for the types of models they studied.

<p>Author: Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of performing inference in graphical models whose energy is a polynomial function of continuous variables. Our energy minimization method follows a dual decomposition approach, where the global problem is split into subproblems defined over the graph cliques. The optimal solution to these subproblems is obtained by making use of a polynomial system solver. Our algorithm inherits the convergence guarantees of dual decomposition. To speed up optimization, we also introduce a variant of this algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian method. Our experiments illustrate the diversity of computer vision problems that can be expressed with polynomial energies, and demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing continuous inference methods.</p><p>4 0.75593323 <a title="6-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Universality_of_the_Local_Marginal_Polytope.html">448 cvpr-2013-Universality of the Local Marginal Polytope</a></p>

<p>Author: Aurélien Lucchi, Yunpeng Li, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: We propose a working set based approximate subgradient descent algorithm to minimize the margin-sensitive hinge loss arising from the soft constraints in max-margin learning frameworks, such as the structured SVM. We focus on the setting of general graphical models, such as loopy MRFs and CRFs commonly used in image segmentation, where exact inference is intractable and the most violated constraints can only be approximated, voiding the optimality guarantees of the structured SVM’s cutting plane algorithm as well as reducing the robustness of existing subgradient based methods. We show that the proposed method obtains better approximate subgradients through the use of working sets, leading to improved convergence properties and increased reliability. Furthermore, our method allows new constraints to be randomly sampled instead of computed using the more expensive approximate inference techniques such as belief propagation and graph cuts, which can be used to reduce learning time at only a small cost of performance. We demonstrate the strength of our method empirically on the segmentation of a new publicly available electron microscopy dataset as well as the popular MSRC data set and show state-of-the-art results.</p><p>6 0.68136096 <a title="6-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-An_Iterated_L1_Algorithm_for_Non-smooth_Non-convex_Optimization_in_Computer_Vision.html">41 cvpr-2013-An Iterated L1 Algorithm for Non-smooth Non-convex Optimization in Computer Vision</a></p>

<p>Author: Nikolaos Kyriazis, Antonis Argyros</p><p>Abstract: In several hand-object(s) interaction scenarios, the change in the objects ’ state is a direct consequence of the hand’s motion. This has a straightforward representation in Newtonian dynamics. We present the first approach that exploits this observation to perform model-based 3D tracking of a table-top scene comprising passive objects and an active hand. Our forward modelling of 3D hand-object(s) interaction regards both the appearance and the physical state of the scene and is parameterized over the hand motion (26 DoFs) between two successive instants in time. We demonstrate that our approach manages to track the 3D pose of all objects and the 3D pose and articulation of the hand by only searching for the parameters of the hand motion. In the proposed framework, covert scene state is inferred by connecting it to the overt state, through the incorporation of physics. Thus, our tracking approach treats a variety of challenging observability issues in a principled manner, without the need to resort to heuristics.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.89917302 <a title="6-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Comparative_Study_of_Modern_Inference_Techniques_for_Discrete_Energy_Minimization_Problems.html">6 cvpr-2013-A Comparative Study of Modern Inference Techniques for Discrete Energy Minimization Problems</a></p>

<p>Author: Gim Hee Lee, Friedrich Faundorfer, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a visual ego-motion estimation algorithm for a self-driving car equipped with a closeto-market multi-camera system. By modeling the multicamera system as a generalized camera and applying the non-holonomic motion constraint of a car, we show that this leads to a novel 2-point minimal solution for the generalized essential matrix where the full relative motion including metric scale can be obtained. We provide the analytical solutions for the general case with at least one inter-camera correspondence and a special case with only intra-camera correspondences. We show that up to a maximum of 6 solutions exist for both cases. We identify the existence of degeneracy when the car undergoes straight motion in the special case with only intra-camera correspondences where the scale becomes unobservable and provide a practical alternative solution. Our formulation can be efficiently implemented within RANSAC for robust estimation. We verify the validity of our assumptions on the motion model by comparing our results on a large real-world dataset collected by a car equipped with 4 cameras with minimal overlapping field-of-views against the GPS/INS ground truth.</p><p>5 0.88594407 <a title="6-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Re-ranking_of_Diverse_Segmentations.html">132 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Re-ranking of Diverse Segmentations</a></p>
<p>Author: Payman Yadollahpour, Dhruv Batra, Gregory Shakhnarovich</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a two-stage approach to semantic image segmentation. In the first stage a probabilistic model generates a set of diverse plausible segmentations. In the second stage, a discriminatively trained re-ranking model selects the best segmentation from this set. The re-ranking stage can use much more complex features than what could be tractably used in the probabilistic model, allowing a better exploration of the solution space than possible by simply producing the most probable solution from the probabilistic model. While our proposed approach already achieves state-of-the-art results (48.1%) on the challenging VOC 2012 dataset, our machine and human analyses suggest that even larger gains are possible with such an approach.</p><p>6 0.87387919 <a title="6-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Understanding_Indoor_Scenes_Using_3D_Geometric_Phrases.html">446 cvpr-2013-Understanding Indoor Scenes Using 3D Geometric Phrases</a></p>

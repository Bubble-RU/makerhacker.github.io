<p>Author: Ju Shen, Sen-Ching S. Cheung</p><p>Abstract: The recent popularity of structured-light depth sensors has enabled many new applications from gesture-based user interface to 3D reconstructions. The quality of the depth measurements of these systems, however, is far from perfect. Some depth values can have significant errors, while others can be missing altogether. The uncertainty in depth measurements among these sensors can significantly degrade the performance of any subsequent vision processing. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model to capture various types of uncertainties in the depth measurement process among structured-light systems. The key to our model is the use of depth layers to account for the differences between foreground objects and background scene, the missing depth value phenomenon, and the correlation between color and depth channels. The depth layer labeling is solved as a maximum a-posteriori estimation problem, and a Markov Random Field attuned to the uncertainty in measurements is used to spatially smooth the labeling process. Using the depth-layer labels, we propose a depth correction and completion algorithm that outperforms oth- er techniques in the literature.</p><p>3 0.27593711 <a title="196-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Hollywood_3D%3A_Recognizing_Actions_in_3D_Natural_Scenes.html">205 cvpr-2013-Hollywood 3D: Recognizing Actions in 3D Natural Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Simon Hadfield, Richard Bowden</p><p>Abstract: Action recognition in unconstrained situations is a difficult task, suffering from massive intra-class variations. It is made even more challenging when complex 3D actions are projected down to the image plane, losing a great deal of information. The recent emergence of 3D data, both in broadcast content, and commercial depth sensors, provides the possibility to overcome this issue. This paper presents a new dataset, for benchmarking action recognition algorithms in natural environments, while making use of 3D information. The dataset contains around 650 video clips, across 14 classes. In addition, two state of the art action recognition algorithms are extended to make use ofthe 3D data, andfive new interestpoint detection strategies are alsoproposed, that extend to the 3D data. Our evaluation compares all 4 feature descriptors, using 7 different types of interest point, over a variety of threshold levels, for the Hollywood3D dataset. We make the dataset including stereo video, estimated depth maps and all code required to reproduce the benchmark results, available to the wider community.</p><p>4 0.25002408 <a title="196-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Spatio-temporal_Depth_Cuboid_Similarity_Feature_for_Activity_Recognition_Using_Depth_Camera.html">407 cvpr-2013-Spatio-temporal Depth Cuboid Similarity Feature for Activity Recognition Using Depth Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Lu Xia, J.K. Aggarwal</p><p>Abstract: Local spatio-temporal interest points (STIPs) and the resulting features from RGB videos have been proven successful at activity recognition that can handle cluttered backgrounds and partial occlusions. In this paper, we propose its counterpart in depth video and show its efficacy on activity recognition. We present a filtering method to extract STIPsfrom depth videos (calledDSTIP) that effectively suppress the noisy measurements. Further, we build a novel depth cuboid similarity feature (DCSF) to describe the local 3D depth cuboid around the DSTIPs with an adaptable supporting size. We test this feature on activity recognition application using the public MSRAction3D, MSRDailyActivity3D datasets and our own dataset. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach outperforms stateof-the-art activity recognition algorithms on depth videos, and the framework is more widely applicable than existing approaches. We also give detailed comparisons with other features and analysis of choice of parameters as a guidance for applications.</p><p>5 0.22170742 <a title="196-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Simultaneous_Super-Resolution_of_Depth_and_Images_Using_a_Single_Camera.html">397 cvpr-2013-Simultaneous Super-Resolution of Depth and Images Using a Single Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Hee Seok Lee, Kuoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a convex optimization framework for simultaneous estimation of super-resolved depth map and images from a single moving camera. The pixel measurement error in 3D reconstruction is directly related to the resolution of the images at hand. In turn, even a small measurement error can cause significant errors in reconstructing 3D scene structure or camera pose. Therefore, enhancing image resolution can be an effective solution for securing the accuracy as well as the resolution of 3D reconstruction. In the proposed method, depth map estimation and image super-resolution are formulated in a single energy minimization framework with a convex function and solved efficiently by a first-order primal-dual algorithm. Explicit inter-frame pixel correspondences are not required for our super-resolution procedure, thus we can avoid a huge computation time and obtain improved depth map in the accuracy and resolution as well as highresolution images with reasonable time. The superiority of our algorithm is demonstrated by presenting the improved depth map accuracy, image super-resolution results, and camera pose estimation.</p><p>6 0.21609163 <a title="196-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_Changes_in_3D_Structure_of_a_Scene_from_Multi-view_Images_Captured_by_a_Vehicle-Mounted_Camera.html">117 cvpr-2013-Detecting Changes in 3D Structure of a Scene from Multi-view Images Captured by a Vehicle-Mounted Camera</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhe Yang, Zhiwei Xiong, Yueyi Zhang, Jiao Wang, Feng Wu</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes novel density modulated binary patterns for depth acquisition. Similar to Kinect, the illumination patterns do not need a projector for generation and can be emitted by infrared lasers and diffraction gratings. Our key idea is to use the density of light spots in the patterns to carry phase information. Two technical problems are addressed here. First, we propose an algorithm to design the patterns to carry more phase information without compromising the depth reconstruction from a single captured image as with Kinect. Second, since the carried phase is not strictly sinusoidal, the depth reconstructed from the phase contains a systematic error. We further propose a pixelbased phase matching algorithm to reduce the error. Experimental results show that the depth quality can be greatly improved using the phase carried by the density of light spots. Furthermore, our scheme can achieve 20 fps depth reconstruction with GPU assistance.</p><p>5 0.77565879 <a title="196-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Layer_Depth_Denoising_and_Completion_for_Structured-Light_RGB-D_Cameras.html">245 cvpr-2013-Layer Depth Denoising and Completion for Structured-Light RGB-D Cameras</a></p>

<p>Author: Eduard Trulls, Iasonas Kokkinos, Alberto Sanfeliu, Francesc Moreno-Noguer</p><p>Abstract: In this work we exploit segmentation to construct appearance descriptors that can robustly deal with occlusion and background changes. For this, we downplay measurements coming from areas that are unlikely to belong to the same region as the descriptor’s center, as suggested by soft segmentation masks. Our treatment is applicable to any image point, i.e. dense, and its computational overhead is in the order of a few seconds. We integrate this idea with Dense SIFT, and also with Dense Scale and Rotation Invariant Descriptors (SID), delivering descriptors that are densely computable, invariant to scaling and rotation, and robust to background changes. We apply our approach to standard benchmarks on large displacement motion estimation using SIFT-flow and widebaseline stereo, systematically demonstrating that the introduction of segmentation yields clear improvements.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.89267302 <a title="196-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-HON4D%3A_Histogram_of_Oriented_4D_Normals_for_Activity_Recognition_from_Depth_Sequences.html">196 cvpr-2013-HON4D: Histogram of Oriented 4D Normals for Activity Recognition from Depth Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Omar Oreifej, Zicheng Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a new descriptor for activity recognition from videos acquired by a depth sensor. Previous descriptors mostly compute shape and motion features independently; thus, they often fail to capture the complex joint shapemotion cues at pixel-level. In contrast, we describe the depth sequence using a histogram capturing the distribution of the surface normal orientation in the 4D space of time, depth, and spatial coordinates. To build the histogram, we create 4D projectors, which quantize the 4D space and represent the possible directions for the 4D normal. We initialize the projectors using the vertices of a regular polychoron. Consequently, we refine the projectors using a discriminative density measure, such that additional projectors are induced in the directions where the 4D normals are more dense and discriminative. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our descriptor better captures the joint shape-motion cues in the depth sequence, and thus outperforms the state-of-the-art on all relevant benchmarks.</p><p>3 0.89224899 <a title="196-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Fusing_Robust_Face_Region_Descriptors_via_Multiple_Metric_Learning_for_Face_Recognition_in_the_Wild.html">182 cvpr-2013-Fusing Robust Face Region Descriptors via Multiple Metric Learning for Face Recognition in the Wild</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhen Cui, Wen Li, Dong Xu, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In many real-world face recognition scenarios, face images can hardly be aligned accurately due to complex appearance variations or low-quality images. To address this issue, we propose a new approach to extract robust face region descriptors. Specifically, we divide each image (resp. video) into several spatial blocks (resp. spatial-temporal volumes) and then represent each block (resp. volume) by sum-pooling the nonnegative sparse codes of position-free patches sampled within the block (resp. volume). Whitened Principal Component Analysis (WPCA) is further utilized to reduce the feature dimension, which leads to our Spatial Face Region Descriptor (SFRD) (resp. Spatial-Temporal Face Region Descriptor, STFRD) for images (resp. videos). Moreover, we develop a new distance method for face verification metric learning called Pairwise-constrained Multiple Metric Learning (PMML) to effectively integrate the face region descriptors of all blocks (resp. volumes) from an image (resp. a video). Our work achieves the state- of-the-art performances on two real-world datasets LFW and YouTube Faces (YTF) according to the restricted protocol.</p><p>4 0.87959474 <a title="196-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_a_Joint_Pixel-wise_and_Part-wise_Formulation.html">207 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using a Joint Pixel-wise and Part-wise Formulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ľ</p><p>Abstract: Our goal is to detect humans and estimate their 2D pose in single images. In particular, handling cases of partial visibility where some limbs may be occluded or one person is partially occluding another. Two standard, but disparate, approaches have developed in the field: the first is the part based approach for layout type problems, involving optimising an articulated pictorial structure; the second is the pixel based approach for image labelling involving optimising a random field graph defined on the image. Our novel contribution is a formulation for pose estimation which combines these two models in a principled way in one optimisation problem and thereby inherits the advantages of both of them. Inference on this joint model finds the set of instances of persons in an image, the location of their joints, and a pixel-wise body part labelling. We achieve near or state of the art results on standard human pose data sets, and demonstrate the correct estimation for cases of self-occlusion, person overlap and image truncation.</p><p>5 0.87951356 <a title="196-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Pedestrian_Detection_with_Unsupervised_Multi-stage_Feature_Learning.html">328 cvpr-2013-Pedestrian Detection with Unsupervised Multi-stage Feature Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Sermanet, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Soumith Chintala, Yann Lecun</p><p>Abstract: Pedestrian detection is a problem of considerable practical interest. Adding to the list of successful applications of deep learning methods to vision, we report state-of-theart and competitive results on all major pedestrian datasets with a convolutional network model. The model uses a few new twists, such as multi-stage features, connections that skip layers to integrate global shape information with local distinctive motif information, and an unsupervised method based on convolutional sparse coding to pre-train the filters at each stage.</p><p>6 0.86902213 <a title="196-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-From_Local_Similarity_to_Global_Coding%3A_An_Application_to_Image_Classification.html">178 cvpr-2013-From Local Similarity to Global Coding: An Application to Image Classification</a></p>

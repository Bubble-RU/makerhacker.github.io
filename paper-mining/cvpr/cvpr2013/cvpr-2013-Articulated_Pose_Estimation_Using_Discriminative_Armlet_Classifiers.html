<p>Author: Leonid Pishchulin, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Peter Gehler, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the challenging problem of articulated human pose estimation in still images. We observe that despite high variability of the body articulations, human motions and activities often simultaneously constrain the positions of multiple body parts. Modelling such higher order part dependencies seemingly comes at a cost of more expensive inference, which resulted in their limited use in state-of-the-art methods. In this paper we propose a model that incorporates higher order part dependencies while remaining efficient. We achieve this by defining a conditional model in which all body parts are connected a-priori, but which becomes a tractable tree-structured pictorial structures model once the image observations are available. In order to derive a set of conditioning variables we rely on the poselet-based features that have been shown to be effective for people detection but have so far found limited application for articulated human pose estimation. We demon- strate the effectiveness of our approach on three publicly available pose estimation benchmarks improving or being on-par with state of the art in each case.</p><p>3 0.21717447 <a title="45-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Beyond_Physical_Connections%3A_Tree_Models_in_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">60 cvpr-2013-Beyond Physical Connections: Tree Models in Human Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Fang Wang, Yi Li</p><p>Abstract: Simple tree models for articulated objects prevails in the last decade. However, it is also believed that these simple tree models are not capable of capturing large variations in many scenarios, such as human pose estimation. This paper attempts to address three questions: 1) are simple tree models sufficient? more specifically, 2) how to use tree models effectively in human pose estimation? and 3) how shall we use combined parts together with single parts efficiently? Assuming we have a set of single parts and combined parts, and the goal is to estimate a joint distribution of their locations. We surprisingly find that no latent variables are introduced in the Leeds Sport Dataset (LSP) during learning latent trees for deformable model, which aims at approximating the joint distributions of body part locations using minimal tree structure. This suggests one can straightforwardly use a mixed representation of single and combined parts to approximate their joint distribution in a simple tree model. As such, one only needs to build Visual Categories of the combined parts, and then perform inference on the learned latent tree. Our method outperformed the state of the art on the LSP, both in the scenarios when the training images are from the same dataset and from the PARSE dataset. Experiments on animal images from the VOC challenge further support our findings.</p><p>4 0.17786953 <a title="45-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Pose_from_Flow_and_Flow_from_Pose.html">334 cvpr-2013-Pose from Flow and Flow from Pose</a></p>
<p>Author: Katerina Fragkiadaki, Han Hu, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Human pose detectors, although successful in localising faces and torsos of people, often fail with lower arms. Motion estimation is often inaccurate under fast movements of body parts. We build a segmentation-detection algorithm that mediates the information between body parts recognition, and multi-frame motion grouping to improve both pose detection and tracking. Motion of body parts, though not accurate, is often sufficient to segment them from their backgrounds. Such segmentations are crucialfor extracting hard to detect body parts out of their interior body clutter. By matching these segments to exemplars we obtain pose labeled body segments. The pose labeled segments and corresponding articulated joints are used to improve the motion flow fields by proposing kinematically constrained affine displacements on body parts. The pose-based articulated motion model is shown to handle large limb rotations and displacements. Our algorithm can detect people under rare poses, frequently missed by pose detectors, showing the benefits of jointly reasoning about pose, segmentation and motion in videos.</p><p>5 0.15548472 <a title="45-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Computationally_Efficient_Regression_on_a_Dependency_Graph_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">89 cvpr-2013-Computationally Efficient Regression on a Dependency Graph for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kota Hara, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical method for human pose estimation from a single still image. In our approach, a dependency graph representing relationships between reference points such as bodyjoints is constructed and thepositions of these reference points are sequentially estimated by a successive application of multidimensional output regressions along the dependency paths, starting from the root node. Each regressor takes image features computed from an image patch centered on the current node ’s position estimated by the previous regressor and is specialized for estimating its child nodes ’ positions. The use of the dependency graph allows us to decompose a complex pose estimation problem into a set of local pose estimation problems that are less complex. We design a dependency graph for two commonly used human pose estimation datasets, the Buffy Stickmen dataset and the ETHZ PASCAL Stickmen dataset, and demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art results on both datasets with significantly lower computation time than existing methods. Furthermore, we propose an importance weighted boosted re- gression trees method for transductive learning settings and demonstrate the resulting improved performance for pose estimation tasks.</p><p>6 0.13990901 <a title="45-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_a_Joint_Pixel-wise_and_Part-wise_Formulation.html">207 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using a Joint Pixel-wise and Part-wise Formulation</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthias Dantone, Juergen Gall, Christian Leistner, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of estimating 2d human pose from still images. Recent methods that rely on discriminatively trained deformable parts organized in a tree model have shown to be very successful in solving this task. Within such a pictorial structure framework, we address the problem of obtaining good part templates by proposing novel, non-linear joint regressors. In particular, we employ two-layered random forests as joint regressors. The first layer acts as a discriminative, independent body part classifier. The second layer takes the estimated class distributions of the first one into account and is thereby able to predict joint locations by modeling the interdependence and co-occurrence of the parts. This results in a pose estimation framework that takes dependencies between body parts already for joint localization into account and is thus able to circumvent typical ambiguities of tree structures, such as for legs and arms. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our body parts dependent joint regressors achieve a higher joint localization accuracy than tree-based state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.76265228 <a title="45-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-MODEC%3A_Multimodal_Decomposable_Models_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">277 cvpr-2013-MODEC: Multimodal Decomposable Models for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben Sapp, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a multimodal, decomposable model for articulated human pose estimation in monocular images. A typical approach to this problem is to use a linear structured model, which struggles to capture the wide range of appearance present in realistic, unconstrained images. In this paper, we instead propose a model of human pose that explicitly captures a variety of pose modes. Unlike other multimodal models, our approach includes both global and local pose cues and uses a convex objective and joint training for mode selection and pose estimation. We also employ a cascaded mode selection step which controls the trade-off between speed and accuracy, yielding a 5x speedup in inference and learning. Our model outperforms state-of-theart approaches across the accuracy-speed trade-off curve for several pose datasets. This includes our newly-collected dataset of people in movies, FLIC, which contains an order of magnitude more labeled data for training and testing than existing datasets. The new dataset and code are avail- able online. 1</p><p>6 0.7448802 <a title="45-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Computationally_Efficient_Regression_on_a_Dependency_Graph_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">89 cvpr-2013-Computationally Efficient Regression on a Dependency Graph for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Antony Lam, Imari Sato</p><p>Abstract: Hyperspectral reflectance data allows for highly accurate spectral relighting under arbitrary illumination, which is invaluable to applications ranging from archiving cultural e-heritage to consumer product design. Past methods for capturing the spectral reflectance of scenes has proven successful in relighting but they all share a common assumption. All the methods do not consider the effects of fluorescence despite fluorescence being found in many everyday objects. In this paper, we describe the very different ways that reflectance and fluorescence interact with illuminants and show the need to explicitly consider fluorescence in the relighting problem. We then propose a robust method based on well established theories of reflectance and fluorescence for imaging each of these components. Finally, we show that we can relight real scenes of reflective-fluorescent surfaces with much higher accuracy in comparison to only considering the reflective component.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.77746874 <a title="45-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_Pose_Estimation_Using_Discriminative_Armlet_Classifiers.html">45 cvpr-2013-Articulated Pose Estimation Using Discriminative Armlet Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgia Gkioxari, Pablo Arbeláez, Lubomir Bourdev, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for human pose estimation in real-world cluttered scenes, and focus on the challenging problem of predicting the pose of both arms for each person in the image. For this purpose, we build on the notion of poselets [4] and train highly discriminative classifiers to differentiate among arm configurations, which we call armlets. We propose a rich representation which, in addition to standardHOGfeatures, integrates the information of strong contours, skin color and contextual cues in a principled manner. Unlike existing methods, we evaluate our approach on a large subset of images from the PASCAL VOC detection dataset, where critical visual phenomena, such as occlusion, truncation, multiple instances and clutter are the norm. Our approach outperforms Yang and Ramanan [26], the state-of-the-art technique, with an improvement from 29.0% to 37.5% PCP accuracy on the arm keypoint prediction task, on this new pose estimation dataset.</p><p>3 0.7512244 <a title="45-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Compact_Binary_Codes_for_Visual_Tracking.html">249 cvpr-2013-Learning Compact Binary Codes for Visual Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Xi Li, Chunhua Shen, Anthony Dick, Anton van_den_Hengel</p><p>Abstract: A key problem in visual tracking is to represent the appearance of an object in a way that is robust to visual changes. To attain this robustness, increasingly complex models are used to capture appearance variations. However, such models can be difficult to maintain accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a visual tracker in which objects are represented by compact and discriminative binary codes. This representation can be processed very efficiently, and is capable of effectively fusing information from multiple cues. An incremental discriminative learner is then used to construct an appearance model that optimally separates the object from its surrounds. Furthermore, we design a hypergraph propagation method to capture the contextual information on samples, which further improves the tracking accuracy. Experimental results on challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker.</p><p>4 0.74725664 <a title="45-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Computationally_Efficient_Regression_on_a_Dependency_Graph_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">89 cvpr-2013-Computationally Efficient Regression on a Dependency Graph for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kota Hara, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical method for human pose estimation from a single still image. In our approach, a dependency graph representing relationships between reference points such as bodyjoints is constructed and thepositions of these reference points are sequentially estimated by a successive application of multidimensional output regressions along the dependency paths, starting from the root node. Each regressor takes image features computed from an image patch centered on the current node ’s position estimated by the previous regressor and is specialized for estimating its child nodes ’ positions. The use of the dependency graph allows us to decompose a complex pose estimation problem into a set of local pose estimation problems that are less complex. We design a dependency graph for two commonly used human pose estimation datasets, the Buffy Stickmen dataset and the ETHZ PASCAL Stickmen dataset, and demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art results on both datasets with significantly lower computation time than existing methods. Furthermore, we propose an importance weighted boosted re- gression trees method for transductive learning settings and demonstrate the resulting improved performance for pose estimation tasks.</p><p>5 0.73824412 <a title="45-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Poselet_Conditioned_Pictorial_Structures.html">335 cvpr-2013-Poselet Conditioned Pictorial Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Leonid Pishchulin, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Peter Gehler, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the challenging problem of articulated human pose estimation in still images. We observe that despite high variability of the body articulations, human motions and activities often simultaneously constrain the positions of multiple body parts. Modelling such higher order part dependencies seemingly comes at a cost of more expensive inference, which resulted in their limited use in state-of-the-art methods. In this paper we propose a model that incorporates higher order part dependencies while remaining efficient. We achieve this by defining a conditional model in which all body parts are connected a-priori, but which becomes a tractable tree-structured pictorial structures model once the image observations are available. In order to derive a set of conditioning variables we rely on the poselet-based features that have been shown to be effective for people detection but have so far found limited application for articulated human pose estimation. We demon- strate the effectiveness of our approach on three publicly available pose estimation benchmarks improving or being on-par with state of the art in each case.</p><p>6 0.73796296 <a title="45-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Lazy_Man%27s_Approach_to_Benchmarking%3A_Semisupervised_Classifier_Evaluation_and_Recalibration.html">15 cvpr-2013-A Lazy Man's Approach to Benchmarking: Semisupervised Classifier Evaluation and Recalibration</a></p>

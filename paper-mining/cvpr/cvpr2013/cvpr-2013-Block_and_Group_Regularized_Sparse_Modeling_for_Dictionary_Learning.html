</p><p>6 Introduction Sparse modeling and dictionary learning have emerged recently as an effective and popular paradigm for solving many important learning problems in computer vision. [sent-14, score-0.611]

</p><p>8 In dictionary learning, Ω(C) is usually based on various sparsity-  Ω  Figure1:Ilustraion fthepro sedBlock/GroupSarseCoding  algorithm. [sent-20, score-0.57]

</p><p>10 promoting norms that depend on the extra structures placed on D, and it is the regularizer Ψ(D) that largely determines the nature of the dictionary D. [sent-22, score-0.584]
</p><p>11 (1) provides the elegant theme, its variations are often composed of extra structures placed on the dictionary D ( [15, 10, 7, 13]), and less frequently, different ways of generating sparsely-coded data X(g) for training the dictionary. [sent-25, score-0.572]
</p><p>12 For classification, a block structure is often imposed on D and hierarchical structures could be further specified using these blocks ([16, 10]), with the aim of endowing the learned dictionary certain predictive power. [sent-27, score-1.044]
</p><p>13 To promote sparsity, the block structure on D is often accompanied by an appropriate block-based ? [sent-28, score-0.303]
</p><p>14 On the other hand, for X(g) , a common approach is to generate a collection of groups of data vectors {xg1 , ··· , xgk} from X and to simultaneously sparse ctoordse { xthe ,d·a·ta· xvect}ors fr oinm e Xac han dda ttao group nXe(og)u [l1y] . [sent-34, score-0.282]
</p><p>15 In a noiseless setting, our proposed problem of encoding sparse representations for a group of data samples X using 333777557  the minimum number of blocks from D can be cast as the following optimization program:  P? [sent-38, score-0.473]

</p><p>17 (3)  We will call this program Block/Group Sparse Coding (BGSC) as it incorporates both the group structure in data and block structure in the dictionary. [sent-55, score-0.482]
</p><p>18 In some applications of which the main concern is identifying contributing blocks rather than finding the sparse representation [7], the following optimization program is considered:  P? [sent-56, score-0.374]
</p><p>19 m Sharing of dictionary atoms for data in the same group had been shown to increase the discriminative power of the dictionary ([1]). [sent-85, score-1.386]
</p><p>20 With the block structure added to dictionary D, our proposed BGSC and R-BGSC algorithms promote a group of data to share only few blocks of D for encoding. [sent-86, score-1.17]
</p><p>21 Therefore, incorporating these SC algorithms in a dictionary learning framework, which iteratively updates coefficients of data and updates atoms of D, will result in training each block of D using only few groups of data. [sent-87, score-1.224]
</p><p>22 This means that, for example, a badly written digit ’9’, which looks like a ’7’, when grouped together with other normally written ’9’s, will be encoded using atoms these ’9’s used. [sent-88, score-0.418]
</p><p>23 The badly written ’9’ will, in turns, be used to train the atoms in D that represent ’9’s rather than those that represent ’7’s. [sent-89, score-0.31]
</p><p>24 Another novelty of our framework is that we do not assign a class of signals to specific blocks of a dictionary, unlike other Sparse Representation based Classification (SRC) [6, 17] and [13]. [sent-90, score-0.266]
</p><p>25 This would allow some blocks to store shared features between some different classes. [sent-91, score-0.232]
</p><p>26 [13] trained a single dictionary block for  each group of data. [sent-94, score-0.901]
</p><p>27 This method increases the redundancy of the information encoded in the learned dictionary as the informationcommonto two ormore groups (acommon scenario in many classification problems) will need to be stored separately within each block. [sent-95, score-0.68]
</p><p>28 Since one dictionary block is assigned to each class, the redundancy induced in the dictionary needs to be reduced for greater efficiency. [sent-96, score-1.36]
</p><p>29 This is done by removing dictionary elements whose mutual dot product has an absolute value greater than an arbitrary-chosen threshold (e. [sent-97, score-0.584]
</p><p>30 In particular, our proposal to encode data from a single class using multiple blocks obviates the need to even incorporate an explicit inter-block coherence minimization term unlike [13]. [sent-102, score-0.524]

</p><p>32 A way to achieve minimum μS is to make atoms orthonormal within each block [11, 3]. [sent-110, score-0.478]
</p><p>33 However, such dictionaries (over-complete dictionary with union of orthonormal basis) do not perform as well as those with more flexible structure [14]. [sent-111, score-0.688]
</p><p>34 For example, in SRC-based face recognition, each block contains atoms representing faces of the  same person. [sent-112, score-0.424]
</p><p>35 It does not make sense to impose strict orthogonality on each block. [sent-113, score-0.173]
</p><p>36 Therefore, rather than imposing strong orthogonality constraint on each block, we propose a dictionary learning algorithm that minimizes only intrablock coherence. [sent-114, score-0.856]
</p><p>37 The proposed dictionary learning framework learns the dictionary D by minimizing the objective function given in Eq. [sent-115, score-1.153]
</p><p>38 (16) measures the mutual coherence within each block of D. [sent-117, score-0.537]
</p><p>39 The corresponding sparse coding can be either BGSC or R-BGSC. [sent-118, score-0.171]
</p><p>40 Besides the novel sparse coding algorithms, BGSC and R-BGSC, there are three specific features that distinguish our dictionary framework from existing methods: 1. [sent-119, score-0.716]
</p><p>41 4 minimizes the intrablock coherence as one of its main objectives. [sent-122, score-0.395]
</p><p>42 Our framework does not require to assign a class or a group of data to block(s) in the dictionary as in [13]. [sent-124, score-0.717]
</p><p>43 This allows some blocks of the dictionary to be shared by different classes. [sent-125, score-0.777]
</p><p>44 The dictionary is trained simultaneously with respect to each group of training samples X(g) using our proposed block/group regularized SC algorithm. [sent-127, score-0.757]
</p><p>45 We will start with sparse coding algorithms first and work our way towards the full dictionary learning algorithm. [sent-133, score-0.749]
</p><p>46 We denote scalars with lower-case letters, vectors with bold lower-case letters, matrices with upper-case letters, and the i-th block and group of a matrix (or vector) with Z[i] , and Z(i) , respectively. [sent-134, score-0.356]

</p><p>48 (13), the block sparsity of C depends on the value of λ. [sent-265, score-0.242]
</p><p>49 When there is no block structure on D, BGSC is equivalent to the group sparse coding (GSC) in [1]. [sent-273, score-0.59]

</p><p>53 =r  where cr is the r-th row of C and dr is in block b. [sent-353, score-0.363]
</p><p>54 It is clear from the first three terms of the above equation why group-regularized SC algorithms tend to generate high intra-block coherence blocks. [sent-356, score-0.256]
</p><p>55 As we can see, the value of dr depends not only on how much it is being used to encode X (1st and 3rd term) but also on how much other dk’s are being used to encode X. [sent-357, score-0.187]
</p><p>56 Since, BGSC and R-BGSC minimize the number of blocks to be used for encoding X, the atoms dr are likely  in the same block as dk. [sent-358, score-0.753]
</p><p>57 For example, if the coefficient C of X has only one non-zero block, then the atoms dr and dk, which correspond to the non-zero rows of coefficients c’s in the above equation, are all in the same block. [sent-359, score-0.441]
</p><p>58 This justifies putting the intra-block coherence suppressing regularizer term in Eq. [sent-361, score-0.363]

</p><p>67 For the experiment in the last column of Table 1, we assign two blocks to each digit. [sent-397, score-0.239]
</p><p>68 The results show that the error rates are similar when the number of blocks (nb) is greater than 10 even though the number of classes of this dataset is 10. [sent-398, score-0.305]
</p><p>69 2(a), the sparse coefficients of most of the training data have 3 to 6 active blocks when nb = 20. [sent-401, score-0.585]
</p><p>70 The last column of Table 1 shows that the hard assignment of blocks to classes results in higher error rate even though the size of the dictionary is twice as large as those of the first three experiments in Table 1. [sent-402, score-0.83]
</p><p>71 As mentioned in the Introduction, we did not assign blocks to classes and prefer using more blocks for encoding data with larger variability. [sent-403, score-0.447]
</p><p>72 We can see that ’7’ and ’9’ share two blocks of dictionary due to their similarity. [sent-407, score-0.753]
</p><p>73 However, they each have an exclusive block with large coefficients (darker in color) to allow them to encode the difference. [sent-408, score-0.413]
</p><p>74 52 †: Assign each digit to two blocks of the dictionary. [sent-417, score-0.297]
</p><p>75 When β = 0, our ICS-DL algorithm does not suppress intra-block coherence and is hence equivalent to the dictionary learning algorithm in [1]. [sent-421, score-0.873]
</p><p>76 We stopped the training roughly after 200 iterations when the dictionary update did not change much. [sent-427, score-0.597]
</p><p>77 The results in Table 2 suggest that suppressing the intra-block coherence can indeed improve the performance. [sent-428, score-0.324]
</p><p>78 In the extreme case when imposing a strict orthogonality on the blocks using the UOB-DL, the error rate increases to 4. [sent-430, score-0.493]
</p><p>79 These results provide an empirical support for not using strict orthogonality constraint. [sent-432, score-0.173]
</p><p>80 However, our ICS-DL algorithm does not impose any inter-block orthogonality constraint on the dictionary as SISF-DL does. [sent-434, score-0.649]
</p><p>81 12 To further demonstrate the intra-block coherence suppressing property of our ICS-DL algorithm, we plot the intra-block coherence values of the dictionaries trained with β = 0 and β = 200, respectively, in Fig. [sent-444, score-0.645]
</p><p>82 Solid and dotted lines indicate the coherence and error, respectively. [sent-447, score-0.297]
</p><p>83 The red solid line demonstrates that our ICS-DL method can keep the intra-block coherence at a low value. [sent-448, score-0.292]
</p><p>84 On the contrary, without the intra-block coherence suppression term, the blue solid line shows that the coherence value becomes comparably large with increasing number of iterations. [sent-449, score-0.583]
</p><p>85 Once we have a trained dictionary, we used the coefficients of training samples to train ten linear SVMs. [sent-451, score-0.236]
</p><p>86 Another way to obtain coefficients of training samples is to recompute them individually. [sent-453, score-0.197]
</p><p>87 The dictionary was trained with β = 400, λtrain = 0. [sent-456, score-0.545]
</p><p>88 Finally, we compared our results with other state-of-theart results using dictionary learning algorithms ([13, 12]) shown in Table 3. [sent-466, score-0.578]
</p><p>89 We also compare with the UOBDL ([11]) which imposes strict orthogonality constraint on  blocks. [sent-467, score-0.173]
</p><p>90 The results show that our algorithms  outperform  other dictionary learning methods, even the one specially tailored for hand-written digits recognition [8]. [sent-468, score-0.578]
</p><p>91 Although Table 2 suggests that suppressing intra-block coherence of D improves the classification performance, imposing a strict orthogonality on the blocks, however, does not result in any improvement. [sent-469, score-0.558]
</p><p>92 (b) Intra-block coherence (solid) and error rates (dotted) of two dictionaries (red for β = 200 and blue for β = 0). [sent-482, score-0.418]

<p>Author: Simon Hawe, Matthias Seibert, Martin Kleinsteuber</p><p>Abstract: Many techniques in computer vision, machine learning, and statistics rely on the fact that a signal of interest admits a sparse representation over some dictionary. Dictionaries are either available analytically, or can be learned from a suitable training set. While analytic dictionaries permit to capture the global structure of a signal and allow a fast implementation, learned dictionaries often perform better in applications as they are more adapted to the considered class of signals. In imagery, unfortunately, the numerical burden for (i) learning a dictionary and for (ii) employing the dictionary for reconstruction tasks only allows to deal with relatively small image patches that only capture local image information. The approach presented in this paper aims at overcoming these drawbacks by allowing a separable structure on the dictionary throughout the learning process. On the one hand, this permits larger patch-sizes for the learning phase, on the other hand, the dictionary is applied efficiently in reconstruction tasks. The learning procedure is based on optimizing over a product of spheres which updates the dictionary as a whole, thus enforces basic dictionary proper- , ties such as mutual coherence explicitly during the learning procedure. In the special case where no separable structure is enforced, our method competes with state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods like K-SVD.</p><p>3 0.42742762 <a title="66-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-level_Discriminative_Dictionary_Learning_towards_Hierarchical_Visual_Categorization.html">296 cvpr-2013-Multi-level Discriminative Dictionary Learning towards Hierarchical Visual Categorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Li Shen, Shuhui Wang, Gang Sun, Shuqiang Jiang, Qingming Huang</p><p>Abstract: For the task of visual categorization, the learning model is expected to be endowed with discriminative visual feature representation and flexibilities in processing many categories. Many existing approaches are designed based on a flat category structure, or rely on a set of pre-computed visual features, hence may not be appreciated for dealing with large numbers of categories. In this paper, we propose a novel dictionary learning method by taking advantage of hierarchical category correlation. For each internode of the hierarchical category structure, a discriminative dictionary and a set of classification models are learnt for visual categorization, and the dictionaries in different layers are learnt to exploit the discriminative visual properties of different granularity. Moreover, the dictionaries in lower levels also inherit the dictionary of ancestor nodes, so that categories in lower levels are described with multi-scale visual information using our dictionary learning approach. Experiments on ImageNet object data subset and SUN397 scene dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves promising performance on data with large numbers of classes compared with some state-of-the-art methods, and is more efficient in processing large numbers of categories.</p><p>4 0.39724949 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Structured_Low-Rank_Representations_for_Image_Classification.html">257 cvpr-2013-Learning Structured Low-Rank Representations for Image Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Li He, Hairong Qi, Russell Zaretzki</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning overcomplete dictionaries for the coupled feature spaces, where the learned dictionaries also reflect the relationship between the two spaces. A Bayesian method using a beta process prior is applied to learn the over-complete dictionaries. Compared to previous couple feature spaces dictionary learning algorithms, our algorithm not only provides dictionaries that customized to each feature space, but also adds more consistent and accurate mapping between the two feature spaces. This is due to the unique property of the beta process model that the sparse representation can be decomposed to values and dictionary atom indicators. The proposed algorithm is able to learn sparse representations that correspond to the same dictionary atoms with the same sparsity but different values in coupled feature spaces, thus bringing consistent and accurate mapping between coupled feature spaces.

<p>Author: Simon Hawe, Matthias Seibert, Martin Kleinsteuber</p><p>Abstract: Many techniques in computer vision, machine learning, and statistics rely on the fact that a signal of interest admits a sparse representation over some dictionary. Dictionaries are either available analytically, or can be learned from a suitable training set. While analytic dictionaries permit to capture the global structure of a signal and allow a fast implementation, learned dictionaries often perform better in applications as they are more adapted to the considered class of signals. In imagery, unfortunately, the numerical burden for (i) learning a dictionary and for (ii) employing the dictionary for reconstruction tasks only allows to deal with relatively small image patches that only capture local image information. The approach presented in this paper aims at overcoming these drawbacks by allowing a separable structure on the dictionary throughout the learning process. On the one hand, this permits larger patch-sizes for the learning phase, on the other hand, the dictionary is applied efficiently in reconstruction tasks. The learning procedure is based on optimizing over a product of spheres which updates the dictionary as a whole, thus enforces basic dictionary proper- , ties such as mutual coherence explicitly during the learning procedure. In the special case where no separable structure is enforced, our method competes with state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods like K-SVD.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.97106701 <a title="66-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Block_and_Group_Regularized_Sparse_Modeling_for_Dictionary_Learning.html">66 cvpr-2013-Block and Group Regularized Sparse Modeling for Dictionary Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Huizhong Chen, Andrew C. Gallagher, Bernd Girod</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new idea in describing people using their first names, i.e., the name assigned at birth. We show that describing people in terms of similarity to a vector of possible first names is a powerful description of facial appearance that can be used for face naming and building facial attribute classifiers. We build models for 100 common first names used in the United States and for each pair, construct a pairwise firstname classifier. These classifiers are built using training images downloaded from the internet, with no additional user interaction. This gives our approach important advantages in building practical systems that do not require additional human intervention for labeling. We use the scores from each pairwise name classifier as a set of facial attributes. We show several surprising results. Our name attributes predict the correct first names of test faces at rates far greater than chance. The name attributes are applied to gender recognition and to age classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with all training images automatically gathered from the internet.</p><p>2 0.92734593 <a title="66-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Representing_and_Discovering_Adversarial_Team_Behaviors_Using_Player_Roles.html">356 cvpr-2013-Representing and Discovering Adversarial Team Behaviors Using Player Roles</a></p>
<p>Author: Patrick Lucey, Alina Bialkowski, Peter Carr, Stuart Morgan, Iain Matthews, Yaser Sheikh</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we describe a method to represent and discover adversarial group behavior in a continuous domain. In comparison to other types of behavior, adversarial behavior is heavily structured as the location of a player (or agent) is dependent both on their teammates and adversaries, in addition to the tactics or strategies of the team. We present a method which can exploit this relationship through the use of a spatiotemporal basis model. As players constantly change roles during a match, we show that employing a “role-based” representation instead of one based on player “identity” can best exploit the playing structure. As vision-based systems currently do not provide perfect detection/tracking (e.g. missed or false detections), we show that our compact representation can effectively “denoise ” erroneous detections as well as enabling temporal analysis, which was previously prohibitive due to the dimensionality of the signal. To evaluate our approach, we used a fully instrumented field-hockey pitch with 8 fixed highdefinition (HD) cameras and evaluated our approach on approximately 200,000 frames of data from a state-of-the- art real-time player detector and compare it to manually labelled data.</p><p>3 0.91692013 <a title="66-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Hallucinated_Humans_as_the_Hidden_Context_for_Labeling_3D_Scenes.html">197 cvpr-2013-Hallucinated Humans as the Hidden Context for Labeling 3D Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun Jiang, Hema Koppula, Ashutosh Saxena</p><p>Abstract: For scene understanding, one popular approach has been to model the object-object relationships. In this paper, we hypothesize that such relationships are only an artifact of certain hidden factors, such as humans. For example, the objects, monitor and keyboard, are strongly spatially correlated only because a human types on the keyboard while watching the monitor. Our goal is to learn this hidden human context (i.e., the human-object relationships), and also use it as a cue for labeling the scenes. We present Infinite Factored Topic Model (IFTM), where we consider a scene as being generated from two types of topics: human configurations and human-object relationships. This enables our algorithm to hallucinate the possible configurations of the humans in the scene parsimoniously. Given only a dataset of scenes containing objects but not humans, we show that our algorithm can recover the human object relationships. We then test our algorithm on the task ofattribute and object labeling in 3D scenes and show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.88981593 <a title="66-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Block_and_Group_Regularized_Sparse_Modeling_for_Dictionary_Learning.html">66 cvpr-2013-Block and Group Regularized Sparse Modeling for Dictionary Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Dong Liu, Kuan-Ting Lai, Guangnan Ye, Ming-Syan Chen, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Late fusion addresses the problem of combining the prediction scores of multiple classifiers, in which each score is predicted by a classifier trained with a specific feature. However, the existing methods generally use a fixed fusion weight for all the scores of a classifier, and thus fail to optimally determine the fusion weight for the individual samples. In this paper, we propose a sample-specific late fusion method to address this issue. Specifically, we cast the problem into an information propagation process which propagates the fusion weights learned on the labeled samples to individual unlabeled samples, while enforcing that positive samples have higher fusion scores than negative samples. In this process, we identify the optimal fusion weights for each sample and push positive samples to top positions in the fusion score rank list. We formulate our problem as a L∞ norm constrained optimization problem and apply the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for the optimization. Extensive experiment results on various visual categorization tasks show that the proposed method consis- tently and significantly beats the state-of-the-art late fusion methods. To the best knowledge, this is the first method supporting sample-specific fusion weight learning.</p><p>6 0.87084872 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Blessing_of_Dimensionality%3A_High-Dimensional_Feature_and_Its_Efficient_Compression_for_Face_Verification.html">64 cvpr-2013-Blessing of Dimensionality: High-Dimensional Feature and Its Efficient Compression for Face Verification</a></p>

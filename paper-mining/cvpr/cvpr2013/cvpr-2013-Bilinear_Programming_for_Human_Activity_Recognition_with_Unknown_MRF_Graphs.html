<p>Author: Baoyuan Wu, Yifan Zhang, Bao-Gang Hu, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on face clustering in videos. Given the detected faces from real-world videos, we partition all faces into K disjoint clusters. Different from clustering on a collection of facial images, the faces from videos are organized as face tracks and the frame index of each face is also provided. As a result, many pairwise constraints between faces can be easily obtained from the temporal and spatial knowledge of the face tracks. These constraints can be effectively incorporated into a generative clustering model based on the Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRFs). Within the HMRF model, the pairwise constraints are augmented by label-level and constraint-level local smoothness to guide the clustering process. The parameters for both the unary and the pairwise potential functions are learned by the simulated field algorithm, and the weights of constraints can be easily adjusted. We further introduce an efficient clustering framework specially for face clustering in videos, considering that faces in adjacent frames of the same face track are very similar. The framework is applicable to other clustering algorithms to significantly reduce the computational cost. Experiments on two face data sets from real-world videos demonstrate the significantly improved performance of our algorithm over state-of-theart algorithms.</p><p>3 0.1660734 <a title="62-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Query_Adaptive_Similarity_for_Large_Scale_Object_Retrieval.html">343 cvpr-2013-Query Adaptive Similarity for Large Scale Object Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Danfeng Qin, Christian Wengert, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Many recent object retrieval systems rely on local features for describing an image. The similarity between a pair of images is measured by aggregating the similarity between their corresponding local features. In this paper we present a probabilistic framework for modeling the feature to feature similarity measure. We then derive a query adaptive distance which is appropriate for global similarity evaluation. Furthermore, we propose a function to score the individual contributions into an image to image similarity within the probabilistic framework. Experimental results show that our method improves the retrieval accuracy significantly and consistently. Moreover, our result compares favorably to the state-of-the-art.</p><p>4 0.12773667 <a title="62-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Constraints_for_Person_Identification_in_Multimedia_Data.html">389 cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised Learning with Constraints for Person Identification in Multimedia Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Bäuml, Makarand Tapaswi, Rainer Stiefelhagen</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of person identification in TV series. We propose a unified learning framework for multiclass classification which incorporates labeled and unlabeled data, and constraints between pairs of features in the training. We apply the framework to train multinomial logistic regression classifiers for multi-class face recognition. The method is completely automatic, as the labeled data is obtained by tagging speaking faces using subtitles and fan transcripts of the videos. We demonstrate our approach on six episodes each of two diverse TV series and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p><p>5 0.12693958 <a title="62-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Analytic_Bilinear_Appearance_Subspace_Construction_for_Modeling_Image_Irradiance_under_Natural_Illumination_and_Non-Lambertian_Reflectance.html">42 cvpr-2013-Analytic Bilinear Appearance Subspace Construction for Modeling Image Irradiance under Natural Illumination and Non-Lambertian Reflectance</a></p>
<p>Author: Shireen Y. Elhabian, Aly A. Farag</p><p>Abstract: Conventional subspace construction approaches suffer from the need of “large-enough ” image ensemble rendering numerical methods intractable. In this paper, we propose an analytic formulation for low-dimensional subspace construction in which shading cues lie while preserving the natural structure of an image sample. Using the frequencyspace representation of the image irradiance equation, the process of finding such subspace is cast as establishing a relation between its principal components and that of a deterministic set of basis functions, termed as irradiance harmonics. Representing images as matrices further lessen the number of parameters to be estimated to define a bilinear projection which maps the image sample to a lowerdimensional bilinear subspace. Results show significant impact on dimensionality reduction with minimal loss of information as well as robustness against noise.</p><p>6 0.11824273 <a title="62-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Binary_Codes_for_High-Dimensional_Data_Using_Bilinear_Projections.html">246 cvpr-2013-Learning Binary Codes for High-Dimensional Data Using Bilinear Projections</a></p>

<p>Author: Jörg Hendrik Kappes, Markus Speth, Gerhard Reinelt, Christoph Schnörr</p><p>Abstract: Discrete graphical models (also known as discrete Markov random fields) are a major conceptual tool to model the structure of optimization problems in computer vision. While in the last decade research has focused on fast approximative methods, algorithms that provide globally optimal solutions have come more into the research focus in the last years. However, large scale computer vision problems seemed to be out of reach for such methods. In this paper we introduce a promising way to bridge this gap based on partial optimality and structural properties of the underlying problem factorization. Combining these preprocessing steps, we are able to solve grids of size 2048 2048 in less than 90 seconds. On the hitherto unsolva2b04le8 C×h2i0ne4s8e character dataset of Nowozin et al. we obtain provably optimal results in 56% of the instances and achieve competitive runtimes on other recent benchmark problems. While in the present work only generalized Potts models are considered, an extension to general graphical models seems to be feasible.</p><p>4 0.69646013 <a title="62-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Discrete_MRF_Inference_of_Marginal_Densities_for_Non-uniformly_Discretized_Variable_Space.html">128 cvpr-2013-Discrete MRF Inference of Marginal Densities for Non-uniformly Discretized Variable Space</a></p>
<p>Author: Masaki Saito, Takayuki Okatani, Koichiro Deguchi</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the inference of marginal densities based on MRF models. The optimization algorithmsfor continuous variables are only applicable to a limited number of problems, whereas those for discrete variables are versatile. Thus, it is quite common to convert the continuous variables into discrete ones for the problems that ideally should be solved in the continuous domain, such as stereo matching and optical flow estimation. In this paper, we show a novel formulation for this continuous-discrete conversion. The key idea is to estimate the marginal densities in the continuous domain by approximating them with mixtures of rectangular densities. Based on this formulation, we derive a mean field (MF) algorithm and a belief propagation (BP) algorithm. These algorithms can correctly handle the case where the variable space is discretized in a non-uniform manner. By intentionally using such a non-uniform discretization, a higher balance between computational efficiency and accuracy of marginal density estimates could be achieved. We present a method for actually doing this, which dynamically discretizes the variable space in a coarse-to-fine manner in the course of the computation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>5 0.69397187 <a title="62-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Comparative_Study_of_Modern_Inference_Techniques_for_Discrete_Energy_Minimization_Problems.html">6 cvpr-2013-A Comparative Study of Modern Inference Techniques for Discrete Energy Minimization Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Jörg H. Kappes, Bjoern Andres, Fred A. Hamprecht, Christoph Schnörr, Sebastian Nowozin, Dhruv Batra, Sungwoong Kim, Bernhard X. Kausler, Jan Lellmann, Nikos Komodakis, Carsten Rother</p><p>Abstract: Seven years ago, Szeliski et al. published an influential study on energy minimization methods for Markov random fields (MRF). This study provided valuable insights in choosing the best optimization technique for certain classes of problems. While these insights remain generally useful today, the phenominal success of random field models means that the kinds of inference problems we solve have changed significantly. Specifically, the models today often include higher order interactions, flexible connectivity structures, large label-spaces of different cardinalities, or learned energy tables. To reflect these changes, we provide a modernized and enlarged study. We present an empirical comparison of 24 state-of-art techniques on a corpus of 2,300 energy minimization instances from 20 diverse computer vision applications. To ensure reproducibility, we evaluate all methods in the OpenGM2 framework and report extensive results regarding runtime and solution quality. Key insights from our study agree with the results of Szeliski et al. for the types of models they studied. However, on new and challenging types of models our findings disagree and suggest that polyhedral methods and integer programming solvers are competitive in terms of runtime and solution quality over a large range of model types.</p><p>6 0.67680776 <a title="62-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Gauging_Association_Patterns_of_Chromosome_Territories_via_Chromatic_Median.html">184 cvpr-2013-Gauging Association Patterns of Chromosome Territories via Chromatic Median</a></p>

<p>Author: Neill D.F. Campbell, Kartic Subr, Jan Kautz</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are used for diverse tasks, ranging from image denoising to object recognition. For images, they are commonly defined as a graph with nodes corresponding to individual pixels and pairwise links that connect nodes to their immediate neighbors. Recent work has shown that fully-connected CRFs, where each node is connected to every other node, can be solved efficiently under the restriction that the pairwise term is a Gaussian kernel over a Euclidean feature space. In this paper, we generalize the pairwise terms to a non-linear dissimilarity measure that is not required to be a distance metric. To this end, we propose a density estimation technique to derive conditional pairwise potentials in a nonparametric manner. We then use an efficient embedding technique to estimate an approximate Euclidean feature space for these potentials, in which the pairwise term can still be expressed as a Gaussian kernel. We demonstrate that the use of non-parametric models for the pairwise interactions, conditioned on the input data, greatly increases expressive power whilst maintaining efficient inference.</p><p>3 0.75600958 <a title="62-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>4 0.74725831 <a title="62-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Hypergraphs_for_Joint_Multi-view_Reconstruction_and_Multi-object_Tracking.html">209 cvpr-2013-Hypergraphs for Joint Multi-view Reconstruction and Multi-object Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Hofmann, Daniel Wolf, Gerhard Rigoll</p><p>Abstract: We generalize the network flow formulation for multiobject tracking to multi-camera setups. In the past, reconstruction of multi-camera data was done as a separate extension. In this work, we present a combined maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation, which jointly models multicamera reconstruction as well as global temporal data association. A flow graph is constructed, which tracks objects in 3D world space. The multi-camera reconstruction can be efficiently incorporated as additional constraints on the flow graph without making the graph unnecessarily large. The final graph is efficiently solved using binary linear programming. On the PETS 2009 dataset we achieve results that significantly exceed the current state of the art.</p><p>5 0.74678761 <a title="62-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Discrete_MRF_Inference_of_Marginal_Densities_for_Non-uniformly_Discretized_Variable_Space.html">128 cvpr-2013-Discrete MRF Inference of Marginal Densities for Non-uniformly Discretized Variable Space</a></p>
<p>Author: Masaki Saito, Takayuki Okatani, Koichiro Deguchi</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the inference of marginal densities based on MRF models. The optimization algorithmsfor continuous variables are only applicable to a limited number of problems, whereas those for discrete variables are versatile. Thus, it is quite common to convert the continuous variables into discrete ones for the problems that ideally should be solved in the continuous domain, such as stereo matching and optical flow estimation. In this paper, we show a novel formulation for this continuous-discrete conversion. The key idea is to estimate the marginal densities in the continuous domain by approximating them with mixtures of rectangular densities. Based on this formulation, we derive a mean field (MF) algorithm and a belief propagation (BP) algorithm. These algorithms can correctly handle the case where the variable space is discretized in a non-uniform manner. By intentionally using such a non-uniform discretization, a higher balance between computational efficiency and accuracy of marginal density estimates could be achieved. We present a method for actually doing this, which dynamically discretizes the variable space in a coarse-to-fine manner in the course of the computation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>6 0.74655145 <a title="62-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Optimal_Geometric_Fitting_under_the_Truncated_L2-Norm.html">317 cvpr-2013-Optimal Geometric Fitting under the Truncated L2-Norm</a></p>

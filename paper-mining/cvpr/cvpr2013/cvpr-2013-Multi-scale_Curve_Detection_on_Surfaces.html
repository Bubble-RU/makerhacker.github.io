The common practice for detecting curves on surfaces requires the user to first select the scale of the features, apply an appropriate smoothing, and detect the edges on the smoothed surface. This approach suffers from two drawbacks. First, it relies on a hidden assumption that all the features on the surface are of the same scale. Second, manual user intervention is required. In this paper, we propose a general framework for automatically detecting the optimal scale for each point on the surface. We smooth the surface at each point according to this optimal scale and run the curve detection algorithm on the resulting surface. Our multi-scale algorithm solves the two disadvantages of the single-scale approach mentioned above. We demonstrate how to realize our approach on two commonly-used special cases: ridges & valleys and relief edges. In each case, the optimal scale is found in accordance with the mathematical definition of the curve.</p><p>Reference: <a title="cvpr-2013-298-reference" href="../cvpr2013_reference/cvpr-2013-Multi-scale_Curve_Detection_on_Surfaces_reference.html">text</a></p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 The common practice for detecting curves on surfaces requires the user to first select the scale of the features, apply an appropriate smoothing, and detect the edges on the smoothed surface.

</p><p>2 In this paper, we propose a general framework for automatically detecting the optimal scale for each point on the surface. [sent-14, score-0.385]
</p><p>3 We smooth the surface at each point according to this optimal scale and run the curve detection algorithm on the resulting surface. [sent-15, score-0.892]
</p><p>4 We demonstrate how to realize our approach on two commonly-used special cases: ridges & valleys and relief edges. [sent-17, score-1.035]
</p><p>5 In each case, the optimal scale is found in accordance with the mathematical definition of the curve. [sent-18, score-0.393]
</p><p>6 Examples of types of curves include ridges & valleys [19], parabolic curves [8], zero-mean curvature curves [8], demarcating curves [9], and relief edges [10], to name a few. [sent-22, score-2.168]
</p><p>7 When relief edges [10] are detected using a single scale, some features are missed and others are inaccurate (a)-(c). [sent-33, score-0.442]
</p><p>8 On the other hand, if the scale is too small, coarse features are localized inaccurately and false features appear. [sent-37, score-0.347]
</p><p>9 However, most state-of-the-art curve detection algorithms use a single scale [1, 5, 9, 10, 19]. [sent-38, score-0.514]
</p><p>10 Our goal is to propose a general framework for automatically estimating the optimal scale at each point on the surface. [sent-40, score-0.385]
</p><p>11 [20] propose a scheme that is designed for a single type of curves, defined as the loci of points whose curvature variation is persistent over all scales. [sent-45, score-0.388]
</p><p>12 Rather, they essentially apply multi-scale smoothing to the object, hopefully leaving the surface features intact. [sent-49, score-0.414]
</p><p>13 However, the scale must be proportional not only to the surface features, but also to the curve type. [sent-50, score-0.785]
</p><p>14 Given a definition of a curve type, we show how to calculate the optimal scale directly from the definition. [sent-55, score-0.59]
</p><p>15 Briefly, every curve type is associated with a function,whose value indicates the strength of the feature. [sent-56, score-0.428]
</p><p>16 This function typically depends on the surface curvature and its derivatives. [sent-57, score-0.557]
</p><p>17 We define the scale at which the maximum is obtained as the optimal scale. [sent-59, score-0.417]
</p><p>18 Using this local optimal scale, the surface is smoothed in a multiscale manner. [sent-60, score-0.533]
</p><p>19 On this surface, the curves are detected, utilizing the original curve detection algorithms. [sent-61, score-0.418]
</p><p>20 We demonstrate the benefit of our approach by applying it to two popular types of curves: ridges & valleys and relief edges. [sent-62, score-1.03]
</p><p>21 Section 4 describes the algorithm for computing the optimal scale at every point. [sent-68, score-0.357]
</p><p>22 Background This section describes the background on curve detection on surfaces and on multi-scale processing on surfaces. [sent-72, score-0.343]
</p><p>23 View-independent curves depend solely on geometric properties of the surface [6, 8, 9, 10, 16, 19]. [sent-76, score-0.506]
</p><p>24 The first is ridges & valleys [19], which are the extrema of principal curvatures and the sec-  ond are relief edges [9, 10], which are the loci of zero crossings of the curvature in the edge direction. [sent-79, score-1.576]
</p><p>25 Mutli scale processing of surfaces: Multi-scale processing of surfaces can be divided into two separate, yet related, tasks. [sent-80, score-0.382]
</p><p>26 The first is the creation of scale space, which simultaneously represents the surface at different scales. [sent-81, score-0.546]
</p><p>27 The second is the optimal scale selection, which automatically selects the scale that best represents the surface locally. [sent-82, score-0.903]
</p><p>28 While in images, which are defined on a regular grid scale space, smoothing is a matter of consensus [13], for surfaces there are many ways to perform smoothing [3, 11, 17, 20, 21]. [sent-85, score-0.592]
</p><p>29 Formally, given a surface S(u, v) : R2 → R3, its scale space representation is S(u, v,t) : R2 → R3, where t is the scale parameter, which is proportional to the amount of smoothing applied to the object. [sent-86, score-0.956]
</p><p>30 Optimal scale selection: In images, the optimal scale selection was developed for edge detection and point-based features by Lindeberg [13]. [sent-89, score-0.737]
</p><p>31 He proved that a function of the image spatial derivatives, which is normalized in a certain way, obtains a single maximum in scale space. [sent-90, score-0.511]
</p><p>32 The scale at  which the maximum is obtained is termed the optimal scale. [sent-91, score-0.417]
</p><p>33 Then, the γ-normalized function of the derivatives of the image, defined as tγ/2f(δxkL(x; t))  (1)  obtains a single maximum at the optimal scale to. [sent-93, score-0.609]
</p><p>34 Optimal scale for surfaces was mostly used for interest point detection. [sent-95, score-0.41]
</p><p>35 At these points, a function of some surface properties, normalized by the scale parameter, obtains a maximum both in the spatial and in the scale domains. [sent-96, score-1.03]
</p><p>36 For instance, [20] compute the ratio between the eigenvalues; [14] compute the area with the minimal descriptor length; [12] compute the optimal size of the support region for computing surface normals. [sent-100, score-0.377]
</p><p>37 Definition of the Optimal Scale Intuitively, the optimal scale at point p is the scale at which the likelihood that a curve passes through p is max-  222222666  imal. [sent-102, score-0.845]
</p><p>38 Hence, the optimal scale is reformulated as the scale at which the normalized curve strength obtains a maximum in scale space. [sent-106, score-1.492]
</p><p>39 Definition: Let curve c have an associated strength function f(K), which depends on the curvature and the curvature derivatives K. [sent-107, score-0.985]
</p><p>40 Let t be the scale parameter, which is related to the amount of smoothing applied to the surface. [sent-108, score-0.368]
</p><p>41 Then, the optimal scale sc of curve c is defined as the scale at which the function obtains a maximum: sc = arg matx tγf(K(t)) ,  (2)  where tγ is the normalization coefficient, similar to what is used in Equation (1). [sent-110, score-0.971]
</p><p>42 The strength function f(K(t)) monotonically decreases with scale, since as the surface becomes smoother, the features appear less prominent. [sent-112, score-0.524]
</p><p>43 This single-maximum  property is proved in Section 5 for two commonly-used spatial curve types: ridges & valleys and relief edges. [sent-115, score-1.203]
</p><p>44 To get a feeling why this is true, recall that a surface can be presented locally, at every point on the surface, as a third degree polynomial (the Monge form) defined on the point’s tangent plane. [sent-116, score-0.335]
</p><p>45 The surface curvature is proportional to the polynomial second derivative. [sent-117, score-0.599]
</p><p>46 According to Equation (2), the normalized second derivative obtains a single maximum in the scale space. [sent-118, score-0.687]
</p><p>47 Therefore, the surface curvature should also obtain a maximum in scale space. [sent-119, score-0.88]
</p><p>48 Thus, the optimal scale (the maximum) is undefined there. [sent-121, score-0.357]
</p><p>49 However, since there exist no curves in a featureless region and our goal is to detect curves, any scale chosen is valid and our definition holds. [sent-122, score-0.559]
</p><p>50 First, we compute the optimal scale at every point on the surface. [sent-126, score-0.385]
</p><p>51 This computation depends on the type of curve we want to detect, and specifically on its corresponding strength function f. [sent-127, score-0.428]
</p><p>52 On this smoothed surface, the curves are finally computed us-  ing their original detection algorithms. [sent-130, score-0.347]
</p><p>53 Computing the optimal scale at every point: For points with features, we apply Equation (2) as is and obtain the optimal scale. [sent-132, score-0.451]
</p><p>54 For featureless points, any value of scale is valid, and yet we need to choose a single scale. [sent-133, score-0.385]
</p><p>55 The scale at a point with high strength is equal to the solution of Equation (2). [sent-136, score-0.482]
</p><p>56 Let p be a point on the surface and ti(p) be the scale that solves Requirement 1. [sent-142, score-0.574]
</p><p>57 The final scale t(p) is found by solving the following system:  w(pt)(Δpt)(p =) t =i(p 0),  (3)  where w(p) is a weight function inversely proportional to  the strength at p and Δ is the Laplacian. [sent-143, score-0.496]
</p><p>58 Creating an optimally-smoothed surface: After the optimal scale at each point has been computed, we create a surface in which each point is smoothed to its optimal scale. [sent-149, score-0.942]
</p><p>59 First, the surface is smoothed uniformly for each scale, using [23]. [sent-151, score-0.409]
</p><p>60 Next, we create a surface for which the coordinates of every vertex are taken from the surface of its corresponding scale. [sent-153, score-0.592]
</p><p>61 Finally, the resulting surface is smoothed in order to remove artifacts. [sent-154, score-0.409]
</p><p>62 Specific Cases In this section we demonstrate how to apply our method to commonly-used curves: ridges & valleys and relief edges. [sent-159, score-1.006]
</p><p>63 Recall that the normalization coefficient γ should be chosen such that to ensure a single maximum of the normalized strength function. [sent-161, score-0.361]
</p><p>64 Derive the expression for the scale at which the normalized strength obtains a maximum. [sent-180, score-0.646]
</p><p>65 Ridges & valleys The most prevalent curves on surfaces are ridges & valleys [19]. [sent-186, score-1.39]
</p><p>66 A ridge (valley) point is a point on a manifold, where the positive (negative) principal curvature obtains a maximum (minimum) along its principal direction. [sent-188, score-0.58]
</p><p>67 We now discuss the four steps mentioned above, for the case of ridges, whereas the case of valleys is similar. [sent-189, score-0.401]
</p><p>68 Surface representation: We approximate a ridge s(x√; t0) of scale t0 with a Gaussian of standard deviation σ = √t0: s(x;t0) =  √21πt0e−x2/2t0. [sent-192, score-0.337]
</p><p>69 We assume that the scale space is represented by convolutions with Gaussians with smoothing parameter t: s(x; t + t0) = s(x; t0) ∗ g(x; t) . [sent-194, score-0.368]
</p><p>70 (5) Thus, the ridge s(x; t0) at scale t is  s(x;t + t0) =? [sent-195, score-0.337]
</p><p>71 to show that the normalized curvature of s(x; t0) obtains a single maximum in scale space at x = 0. [sent-199, score-0.785]
</p><p>72 (6) Then, we take its derivative with respect to t and prove that this derivative is equal to zero only at a single t. [sent-201, score-0.407]
</p><p>73 The curvature κ(x) of a curve s(x) is known to be:  κ(x) = −(1 +s s? [sent-203, score-0.471]
</p><p>74 We need to compute the derivatives ofthe surface (curve) s? [sent-207, score-0.332]
</p><p>75 Results: Figure 3 shows ridges and valleys on objects consisting offeatures ofdifferent scales. [sent-246, score-0.676]
</p><p>76 When we increase the scale (c), the curves become smoother, but some features disappear. [sent-248, score-0.483]
</p><p>77 See the 222222999  (a) Input Accuracy:  (b) fine scale 85%  (c) coarse scale 77%  (d) coarsest scale 42% Figure  4. [sent-251, score-0.906]
</p><p>78 (e) multi scale 91%  The noisy cylinder has both fine and coarse valleys (a). [sent-253, score-0.778]
</p><p>79 It is a cylinder with ridges and valleys of a couple of different scales, to which we added noise, as shown in Fig-  ure 4. [sent-258, score-0.768]
</p><p>80 In terms of error, we computed the percentage of the groundtruth valleys for which there exist real valleys within a predefined distance. [sent-263, score-0.802]
</p><p>81 In practice, we counted the number of faces with ground truth valleys for which there exists a face with a detected valley within 0. [sent-264, score-0.44]
</p><p>82 While the accuracy of the multi-scale results is 91%, for the single scale algorithm the results are between 79% for the finest scale to 42% for the coarsest, The results are: Scale 0 (finest): 79%, Scale 1: 85%, Scale 2: 77%, Scale 3 (coarsest): 42%, and Multiscale: 91%. [sent-266, score-0.583]
</p><p>83 Relief edges Relief edges are defined as zero crossings of the curvature in the direction of the step edge model that best approximates the surface locally [10]. [sent-269, score-0.829]
</p><p>84 They run on the slopes between ridges and valleys and are parallel to them. [sent-270, score-0.7]
</p><p>85 Strength function f: As a strength function f, we employ the curvature derivative with respect to the arclength λ in the edge direction, as proposed in [10]. [sent-271, score-0.729]
</p><p>86 Surface representation: A relief edge is represented, by definition, by a smoothed step edge. [sent-273, score-0.52]
</p><p>87 Let s(x; t0) be a relief edge of an initial scale t0 (an ideal step edge smoothed with a Gaussian of standard deviation σ0 = √t0): s(x;t0) =  √21πt0? [sent-274, score-0.847]
</p><p>88 We want to show that the normalized curvature derivative of s(x; t0) obtains a single maximum in scale space at x = 0. [sent-278, score-0.961]
</p><p>89 To compute ∂k/∂x, we take the derivative of the curvature defined in Equation (7). [sent-283, score-0.45]
</p><p>90 When the scale is small (b), the resulting single scale curves are noisy. [sent-296, score-0.747]
</p><p>91 When the scale is big (c), the single scale curves are smooth but not accurate enough. [sent-297, score-0.747]
</p><p>92 We  now  proceed  to compute  the  curvature  κ(x)  κ(x) =(−t0x+e− tx)23//22(√t0+2tπ)·[1 + e−x2/(t0+t)/1(2π(t0+ t))]3/2 and the curvature derivative  ∂ kx? [sent-300, score-0.724]
</p><p>93 Taking the derivative with respect to t and setting it to zero, we obtain a quadratic equation whose roots are: tmax = (A where  ± B)/C,  (15)  A B C  = = =  2γ − 6πt0 + 8πγt0 + 1, (4γ2 + 40πγt0 + 4γ + 36π2t02 − 12πt0 + 4(3π − 2πγ) . [sent-326, score-0.348]
</p><p>94 Results: Figure 5 depicts relief edges on surfaces having features of various scales. [sent-332, score-0.534]
</p><p>95 It compares two single-scale relief edges with our multi-scale edges. [sent-333, score-0.389]
</p><p>96 This is so, since the depth of the relief varies, thus a single scale is insufficient. [sent-336, score-0.62]
</p><p>97 Conclusion This paper presented a framework for automatic estimation of the optimal scale for curve detection on surfaces. [sent-343, score-0.581]
</p><p>98 It can be applied to any curve type, as long as the curve has a strength function based on the curvature and its derivatives. [sent-344, score-0.859]

<p>Author: Tony Tung, Takashi Matsuyama</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to characterize deformable surface using intrinsic property dynamics. 3D dynamic surfaces representing humans in motion can be obtained using multiple view stereo reconstruction methods or depth cameras. Nowadays these technologies have become capable to capture surface variations in real-time, and give details such as clothing wrinkles and deformations. Assuming repetitive patterns in the deformations, we propose to model complex surface variations using sets of linear dynamical systems (LDS) where observations across time are given by surface intrinsic properties such as local curvatures. We introduce an approach based on bags of dynamical systems, where each surface feature to be represented in the codebook is modeled by a set of LDS equipped with timing structure. Experiments are performed on datasets of real-world dynamical surfaces and show compelling results for description, classification and segmentation.</p><p>3 0.13292146 <a title="298-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic_Harmonic_Mapping_for_Constrained_Brain_Surface_Registration.html">208 cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic Harmonic Mapping for Constrained Brain Surface Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Shi, Wei Zeng, Zhengyu Su, Hanna Damasio, Zhonglin Lu, Yalin Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is an active research field in computer vision, computer graphics and computational geometry. It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquer this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric, so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on the Ricci flow method and the method is general and robust. We apply our algorithm to study constrained human brain surface registration problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic, and achieve relative high performance when evaluated with some popular cortical surface registration evaluation standards.</p><p>4 0.13115969 <a title="298-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Template-Based_Isometric_Deformable_3D_Reconstruction_with_Sampling-Based_Focal_Length_Self-Calibration.html">423 cvpr-2013-Template-Based Isometric Deformable 3D Reconstruction with Sampling-Based Focal Length Self-Calibration</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrien Bartoli, Toby Collins</p><p>Abstract: It has been shown that a surface deforming isometrically can be reconstructed from a single image and a template 3D shape. Methods from the literature solve this problem efficiently. However, they all assume that the camera model is calibrated, which drastically limits their applicability. We propose (i) a general variational framework that applies to (calibrated and uncalibrated) general camera models and (ii) self-calibrating 3D reconstruction algorithms for the weak-perspective and full-perspective camera models. In the former case, our algorithm returns the normal field and camera ’s scale factor. In the latter case, our algorithm returns the normal field, depth and camera ’s focal length. Our algorithms are the first to achieve deformable 3D reconstruction including camera self-calibration. They apply to much more general setups than existing methods. Experimental results on simulated and real data show that our algorithms give results with the same level of accuracy as existing methods (which use the true focal length) on perspective images, and correctly find the normal field on affine images for which the existing methods fail.</p><p>5 0.12248413 <a title="298-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Pattern-Driven_Colorization_of_3D_Surfaces.html">327 cvpr-2013-Pattern-Driven Colorization of 3D Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: George Leifman, Ayellet Tal</p><p>Abstract: Colorization refers to the process of adding color to black & white images or videos. This paper extends the term to handle surfaces in three dimensions. This is important for applications in which the colors of an object need to be restored and no relevant image exists for texturing it. We focus on surfaces with patterns and propose a novel algorithm for adding colors to these surfaces. The user needs only to scribble a few color strokes on one instance of each pattern, and the system proceeds to automatically colorize the whole surface. For this scheme to work, we address not only the problem of colorization, but also the problem of pattern detection on surfaces.</p><p>6 0.12057285 <a title="298-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-What_Object_Motion_Reveals_about_Shape_with_Unknown_BRDF_and_Lighting.html">465 cvpr-2013-What Object Motion Reveals about Shape with Unknown BRDF and Lighting</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Kolomenkin, Ilan Shimshoni, Ayellet Tal</p><p>Abstract: This paper extends to surfaces the multi-scale approach of edge detection on images. The common practice for detecting curves on surfaces requires the user to first select the scale of the features, apply an appropriate smoothing, and detect the edges on the smoothed surface. This approach suffers from two drawbacks. First, it relies on a hidden assumption that all the features on the surface are of the same scale. Second, manual user intervention is required. In this paper, we propose a general framework for automatically detecting the optimal scale for each point on the surface. We smooth the surface at each point according to this optimal scale and run the curve detection algorithm on the resulting surface. Our multi-scale algorithm solves the two disadvantages of the single-scale approach mentioned above. We demonstrate how to realize our approach on two commonly-used special cases: ridges & valleys and relief edges. In each case, the optimal scale is found in accordance with the mathematical definition of the curve.</p><p>2 0.82183415 <a title="298-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic_Harmonic_Mapping_for_Constrained_Brain_Surface_Registration.html">208 cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic Harmonic Mapping for Constrained Brain Surface Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Shi, Wei Zeng, Zhengyu Su, Hanna Damasio, Zhonglin Lu, Yalin Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is an active research field in computer vision, computer graphics and computational geometry. It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquer this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric, so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on the Ricci flow method and the method is general and robust. We apply our algorithm to study constrained human brain surface registration problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic, and achieve relative high performance when evaluated with some popular cortical surface registration evaluation standards.</p><p>3 0.81955045 <a title="298-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Monocular_Template-Based_3D_Reconstruction_of_Extensible_Surfaces_with_Local_Linear_Elasticity.html">289 cvpr-2013-Monocular Template-Based 3D Reconstruction of Extensible Surfaces with Local Linear Elasticity</a></p>
<p>Author: Abed Malti, Richard Hartley, Adrien Bartoli, Jae-Hak Kim</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for template-based extensible surface reconstruction from a single view. We extend the method of isometric surface reconstruction and more recent work on conformal surface reconstruction. Our approach relies on the minimization of a proposed stretching energy formalized with respect to the Poisson ratio parameter of the surface. We derive a patch-based formulation of this stretching energy by assuming local linear elasticity. This formulation unifies geometrical and mechanical constraints in a single energy term. We prevent local scale ambiguities by imposing a set of fixed boundary 3D points. We experimentally prove the sufficiency of this set of boundary points and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different developable and non-developable surfaces with a wide range of extensibility.</p><p>4 0.81482095 <a title="298-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Intrinsic_Characterization_of_Dynamic_Surfaces.html">226 cvpr-2013-Intrinsic Characterization of Dynamic Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Tony Tung, Takashi Matsuyama</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to characterize deformable surface using intrinsic property dynamics. 3D dynamic surfaces representing humans in motion can be obtained using multiple view stereo reconstruction methods or depth cameras. Nowadays these technologies have become capable to capture surface variations in real-time, and give details such as clothing wrinkles and deformations. Assuming repetitive patterns in the deformations, we propose to model complex surface variations using sets of linear dynamical systems (LDS) where observations across time are given by surface intrinsic properties such as local curvatures. We introduce an approach based on bags of dynamical systems, where each surface feature to be represented in the codebook is modeled by a set of LDS equipped with timing structure. Experiments are performed on datasets of real-world dynamical surfaces and show compelling results for description, classification and segmentation.</p><p>5 0.80431008 <a title="298-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Area_Preserving_Brain_Mapping.html">44 cvpr-2013-Area Preserving Brain Mapping</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengyu Su, Wei Zeng, Rui Shi, Yalin Wang, Jian Sun, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Brain mapping transforms the brain cortical surface to canonical planar domains, which plays a fundamental role in morphological study. Most existing brain mapping methods are based on angle preserving maps, which may introduce large area distortions. This work proposes an area preserving brain mapping method based on MongeBrenier theory. The brain mapping is intrinsic to the Riemannian metric, unique, and diffeomorphic. The computation is equivalent to convex energy minimization and power Voronoi diagram construction. Comparing to the existing approaches based on Monge-Kantorovich theory, the proposed one greatly reduces the complexity (from n2 unknowns to n ), and improves the simplicity and efficiency. Experimental results on caudate nucleus surface mapping and cortical surface mapping demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method. Conventional methods for caudate nucleus surface mapping may suffer from numerical instability; in contrast, current method produces diffeomorpic mappings stably. In the study of cortical sur- face classification for recognition of Alzheimer’s Disease, the proposed method outperforms some other morphometry features.</p><p>6 0.75439179 <a title="298-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Contactless%2C_Low-Cost_and_Accurate_3D_Fingerprint_Identification.html">435 cvpr-2013-Towards Contactless, Low-Cost and Accurate 3D Fingerprint Identification</a></p>

<p>Author: Amr Bakry, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a challenging problem, due to confusion between visual speech features. The speaker identification problem is usually coupled with speech recognition. Moreover, speaker identification is important to several applications, such as automatic access control, biometrics, authentication, and personal privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for lipreading and speaker identification. Wepropose a new approachfor manifold parameterization in a low-dimensional latent space, where each manifold is represented as a point in that space. We initially parameterize each instance manifold using a nonlinear mapping from a unified manifold representation. We then factorize the parameter space using Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) to achieve a low-dimension manifold latent space. We use two-way projections to achieve two manifold latent spaces, one for the speech content and one for the speaker. We apply our approach on two public databases: AVLetters and OuluVS. We show the results for three different settings of lipreading: speaker independent, speaker dependent, and speaker semi-dependent. Our approach outperforms for the speaker semi-dependent setting by at least 15% of the baseline, and competes in the other two settings.</p><p>4 0.77912635 <a title="298-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Optical_Flow_Estimation_Using_Laplacian_Mesh_Energy.html">316 cvpr-2013-Optical Flow Estimation Using Laplacian Mesh Energy</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenbin Li, Darren Cosker, Matthew Brown, Rui Tang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel non-rigid optical flow algorithm for dense image correspondence and non-rigid registration. The algorithm uses a unique Laplacian Mesh Energy term to encourage local smoothness whilst simultaneously preserving non-rigid deformation. Laplacian deformation approaches have become popular in graphics research as they enable mesh deformations to preserve local surface shape. In this work we propose a novel Laplacian Mesh Energy formula to ensure such sensible local deformations between image pairs. We express this wholly within the optical flow optimization, and show its application in a novel coarse-to-fine pyramidal approach. Our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance in all trials on the Garg et al. dataset, and top tier performance on the Middlebury evaluation.</p><p>5 0.77881712 <a title="298-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_Segmentation-Aware_Descriptors.html">112 cvpr-2013-Dense Segmentation-Aware Descriptors</a></p>
<p>Author: Eduard Trulls, Iasonas Kokkinos, Alberto Sanfeliu, Francesc Moreno-Noguer</p><p>Abstract: In this work we exploit segmentation to construct appearance descriptors that can robustly deal with occlusion and background changes. For this, we downplay measurements coming from areas that are unlikely to belong to the same region as the descriptor’s center, as suggested by soft segmentation masks. Our treatment is applicable to any image point, i.e. dense, and its computational overhead is in the order of a few seconds. We integrate this idea with Dense SIFT, and also with Dense Scale and Rotation Invariant Descriptors (SID), delivering descriptors that are densely computable, invariant to scaling and rotation, and robust to background changes. We apply our approach to standard benchmarks on large displacement motion estimation using SIFT-flow and widebaseline stereo, systematically demonstrating that the introduction of segmentation yields clear improvements.</p><p>6 0.74240643 <a title="298-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Hypergraphs_for_Joint_Multi-view_Reconstruction_and_Multi-object_Tracking.html">209 cvpr-2013-Hypergraphs for Joint Multi-view Reconstruction and Multi-object Tracking</a></p>

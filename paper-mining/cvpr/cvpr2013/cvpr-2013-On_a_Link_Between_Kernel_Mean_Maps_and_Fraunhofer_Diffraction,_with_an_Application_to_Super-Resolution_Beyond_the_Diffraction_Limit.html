<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices have become popular to encode image information. Accounting for the geometry of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices has proven key to the success of many algorithms. However, most existing methods only approximate the true shape of the manifold locally by its tangent plane. In this paper, inspired by kernel methods, we propose to map SPD matrices to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To encode the geometry of the manifold in the mapping, we introduce a family of provably positive definite kernels on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. These kernels are derived from the Gaussian kernel, but exploit different metrics on the manifold. This lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM and kernel PCA, to the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the problems of pedestrian detection, object categorization, texture analysis, 2D motion segmentation and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) segmentation.</p><p>3 0.14662503 <a title="312-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-First-Person_Activity_Recognition%3A_What_Are_They_Doing_to_Me%3F.html">175 cvpr-2013-First-Person Activity Recognition: What Are They Doing to Me?</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael S. Ryoo, Larry Matthies</p><p>Abstract: This paper discusses the problem of recognizing interaction-level human activities from a first-person viewpoint. The goal is to enable an observer (e.g., a robot or a wearable camera) to understand ‘what activity others are performing to it’ from continuous video inputs. These include friendly interactions such as ‘a person hugging the observer’ as well as hostile interactions like ‘punching the observer’ or ‘throwing objects to the observer’, whose videos involve a large amount of camera ego-motion caused by physical interactions. The paper investigates multichannel kernels to integrate global and local motion information, and presents a new activity learning/recognition methodology that explicitly considers temporal structures displayed in first-person activity videos. In our experiments, we not only show classification results with segmented videos, but also confirm that our new approach is able to detect activities from continuous videos reliably.</p><p>4 0.13645226 <a title="312-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Kernel_Learning_for_Extrinsic_Classification_of_Manifold_Features.html">237 cvpr-2013-Kernel Learning for Extrinsic Classification of Manifold Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Raviteja Vemulapalli, Jaishanker K. Pillai, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: In computer vision applications, features often lie on Riemannian manifolds with known geometry. Popular learning algorithms such as discriminant analysis, partial least squares, support vector machines, etc., are not directly applicable to such features due to the non-Euclidean nature of the underlying spaces. Hence, classification is often performed in an extrinsic manner by mapping the manifolds to Euclidean spaces using kernels. However, for kernel based approaches, poor choice of kernel often results in reduced performance. In this paper, we address the issue of kernelselection for the classification of features that lie on Riemannian manifolds using the kernel learning approach. We propose two criteria for jointly learning the kernel and the classifier using a single optimization problem. Specifically, for the SVM classifier, we formulate the problem of learning a good kernel-classifier combination as a convex optimization problem and solve it efficiently following the multiple kernel learning approach. Experimental results on image set-based classification and activity recognition clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods for classification of manifold features.</p><p>5 0.11107671 <a title="312-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Blind_Deconvolution_of_Widefield_Fluorescence_Microscopic_Data_by_Regularization_of_the_Optical_Transfer_Function_%28OTF%29.html">65 cvpr-2013-Blind Deconvolution of Widefield Fluorescence Microscopic Data by Regularization of the Optical Transfer Function (OTF)</a></p>

<p>Author: Haichao Zhang, David Wipf, Yanning Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a robust algorithm for estimating a single latent sharp image given multiple blurry and/or noisy observations. The underlying multi-image blind deconvolution problem is solved by linking all of the observations together via a Bayesian-inspired penalty function which couples the unknown latent image, blur kernels, and noise levels together in a unique way. This coupled penalty function enjoys a number of desirable properties, including a mechanism whereby the relative-concavity or shape is adapted as a function of the intrinsic quality of each blurry observation. In this way, higher quality observations may automatically contribute more to the final estimate than heavily degraded ones. The resulting algorithm, which requires no essential tuning parameters, can recover a high quality image from a set of observations containing potentially both blurry and noisy examples, without knowing a priorithe degradation type of each observation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world test images clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</p><p>6 0.57688206 <a title="312-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Divide-and-Conquer_Method_for_Scalable_Low-Rank_Latent_Matrix_Pursuit.html">7 cvpr-2013-A Divide-and-Conquer Method for Scalable Low-Rank Latent Matrix Pursuit</a></p>

<p>Author: Robert Anderson, Björn Stenger, Vincent Wan, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a complete system for expressive visual text-to-speech (VTTS), which is capable of producing expressive output, in the form of a ‘talking head’, given an input text and a set of continuous expression weights. The face is modeled using an active appearance model (AAM), and several extensions are proposed which make it more applicable to the task of VTTS. The model allows for normalization with respect to both pose and blink state which significantly reduces artifacts in the resulting synthesized sequences. We demonstrate quantitative improvements in terms of reconstruction error over a million frames, as well as in large-scale user studies, comparing the output of different systems.</p><p>3 0.75771517 <a title="312-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Incorporating_User_Interaction_and_Topological_Constraints_within_Contour_Completion_via_Discrete_Calculus.html">222 cvpr-2013-Incorporating User Interaction and Topological Constraints within Contour Completion via Discrete Calculus</a></p>
<p>Author: Jia Xu, Maxwell D. Collins, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of interactive segmentation and contour completion for multiple objects. The form of constraints our model incorporates are those coming from user scribbles (interior or exterior constraints) as well as information regarding the topology of the 2-D space after partitioning (number of closed contours desired). We discuss how concepts from discrete calculus and a simple identity using the Euler characteristic of a planar graph can be utilized to derive a practical algorithm for this problem. We also present specialized branch and bound methods for the case of single contour completion under such constraints. On an extensive dataset of ∼ 1000 images, our experimOenn tasn suggest vthea dt a assmetal ol fa m∼ou 1n0t0 of ismidaeg knowledge can give strong improvements over fully unsupervised contour completion methods.

<p>Author: Bo Jiang, Chris Ding, Bio Luo, Jin Tang</p><p>Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used to learn a low-dimensional representation. In many applications, both vector data X and graph data W are available. Laplacian embedding is widely used for embedding graph data. Wepropose a graph-Laplacian PCA (gLPCA) to learn a low dimensional representation of X that incorporates graph structures encoded in W. This model has several advantages: (1) It is a data representation model. (2) It has a compact closed-form solution and can be efficiently computed. (3) It is capable to remove corruptions. Extensive experiments on 8 datasets show promising results on image reconstruction and significant improvement on clustering and classification.</p><p>5 0.72036529 <a title="312-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_without_Human_Scores_for_Blind_Image_Quality_Assessment.html">266 cvpr-2013-Learning without Human Scores for Blind Image Quality Assessment</a></p>
<p>Author: Wufeng Xue, Lei Zhang, Xuanqin Mou</p><p>Abstract: General purpose blind image quality assessment (BIQA) has been recently attracting significant attention in thefields of image processing, vision and machine learning. Stateof-the-art BIQA methods usually learn to evaluate the image quality by regression from human subjective scores of the training samples. However, these methods need a large number of human scored images for training, and lack an explicit explanation of how the image quality is affected by image local features. An interesting question is then: can we learn for effective BIQA without using human scored images? This paper makes a good effort to answer this question. We partition the distorted images into overlapped patches, and use a percentile pooling strategy to estimate the local quality of each patch. Then a quality-aware clustering (QAC) method is proposed to learn a set of centroids on each quality level. These centroids are then used as a codebook to infer the quality of each patch in a given image, and subsequently a perceptual quality score of the whole image can be obtained. The proposed QAC based BIQA method is simple yet effective. It not only has comparable accuracy to those methods using human scored images in learning, but also has merits such as high linearity to human perception of image quality, real-time implementation and availability of image local quality map.</p><p>6 0.69074345 <a title="312-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Minimum_Error_Vanishing_Point_Detection_Approach_for_Uncalibrated_Monocular_Images_of_Man-Made_Environments.html">19 cvpr-2013-A Minimum Error Vanishing Point Detection Approach for Uncalibrated Monocular Images of Man-Made Environments</a></p>

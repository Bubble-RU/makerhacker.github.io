<p>Author: Ming Zeng, Jiaxiang Zheng, Xuan Cheng, Xinguo Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for quasi-rigid objects modeling from a sequence of depth scans captured at different time instances. As quasi-rigid objects, such as human bodies, usually have shape motions during the capture procedure, it is difficult to reconstruct their geometries. We represent the shape motion by a deformation graph, and propose a model-to-partmethod to gradually integrate sampled points of depth scans into the deformation graph. Under an as-rigid-as-possible assumption, the model-to-part method can adjust the deformation graph non-rigidly, so as to avoid error accumulation in alignment, which also implicitly achieves loop-closure. To handle the drift and topological error for the deformation graph, two algorithms are introduced. First, we use a two-stage registration to largely keep the rigid motion part. Second, in the step of graph integration, we topology-adaptively integrate new parts and dynamically control the regularization effect of the deformation graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method by several depth sequences of quasi-rigid objects, and an application in human shape modeling.</p><p>3 0.15558833 <a title="426-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Optical_Flow_Estimation_Using_Laplacian_Mesh_Energy.html">316 cvpr-2013-Optical Flow Estimation Using Laplacian Mesh Energy</a></p>

<p>Author: Chunyu Wang, Yizhou Wang, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We address action recognition in videos by modeling the spatial-temporal structures of human poses. We start by improving a state of the art method for estimating human joint locations from videos. More precisely, we obtain the K-best estimations output by the existing method and incorporate additional segmentation cues and temporal constraints to select the “best” one. Then we group the estimated joints into five body parts (e.g. the left arm) and apply data mining techniques to obtain a representation for the spatial-temporal structures of human actions. This representation captures the spatial configurations ofbodyparts in one frame (by spatial-part-sets) as well as the body part movements(by temporal-part-sets) which are characteristic of human actions. It is interpretable, compact, and also robust to errors on joint estimations. Experimental results first show that our approach is able to localize body joints more accurately than existing methods. Next we show that it outperforms state of the art action recognizers on the UCF sport, the Keck Gesture and the MSR-Action3D datasets.</p><p>5 0.14190641 <a title="426-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors.html">206 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using Body Parts Dependent Joint Regressors</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Dantone, Juergen Gall, Christian Leistner, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of estimating 2d human pose from still images. Recent methods that rely on discriminatively trained deformable parts organized in a tree model have shown to be very successful in solving this task. Within such a pictorial structure framework, we address the problem of obtaining good part templates by proposing novel, non-linear joint regressors. In particular, we employ two-layered random forests as joint regressors. The first layer acts as a discriminative, independent body part classifier. The second layer takes the estimated class distributions of the first one into account and is thereby able to predict joint locations by modeling the interdependence and co-occurrence of the parts. This results in a pose estimation framework that takes dependencies between body parts already for joint localization into account and is thus able to circumvent typical ambiguities of tree structures, such as for legs and arms. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our body parts dependent joint regressors achieve a higher joint localization accuracy than tree-based state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.13945027 <a title="426-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Mesh_Based_Semantic_Modelling_for_Indoor_and_Outdoor_Scenes.html">284 cvpr-2013-Mesh Based Semantic Modelling for Indoor and Outdoor Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Henrik Zimmer, Marcel Campen, Leif Kobbelt</p><p>Abstract: In the context of shape segmentation and retrieval object-wide distributions of measures are needed to accurately evaluate and compare local regions ofshapes. Lien et al. [16] proposed two point-wise concavity measures in the context of Approximate Convex Decompositions of polygons measuring the distance from a point to the polygon ’s convex hull: an accurate Shortest Path-Concavity (SPC) measure and a Straight Line-Concavity (SLC) approximation of the same. While both are practicable on 2D shapes, the exponential costs of SPC in 3D makes it inhibitively expensive for a generalization to meshes [14]. In this paper we propose an efficient and straight forward approximation of the Shortest Path-Concavity measure to 3D meshes. Our approximation is based on discretizing the space between mesh and convex hull, thereby reducing the continuous Shortest Path search to an efficiently solvable graph problem. Our approach works outof-the-box on complex mesh topologies and requires no complicated handling of genus. Besides presenting a rigorous evaluation of our method on a variety of input meshes, we also define an SPC-based Shape Descriptor and show its superior retrieval and runtime performance compared with the recently presented results on the Convexity Distribution by Lian et al. [12].</p><p>3 0.59915626 <a title="426-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Poselet_Conditioned_Pictorial_Structures.html">335 cvpr-2013-Poselet Conditioned Pictorial Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Leonid Pishchulin, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Peter Gehler, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the challenging problem of articulated human pose estimation in still images. We observe that despite high variability of the body articulations, human motions and activities often simultaneously constrain the positions of multiple body parts. Modelling such higher order part dependencies seemingly comes at a cost of more expensive inference, which resulted in their limited use in state-of-the-art methods. In this paper we propose a model that incorporates higher order part dependencies while remaining efficient. We achieve this by defining a conditional model in which all body parts are connected a-priori, but which becomes a tractable tree-structured pictorial structures model once the image observations are available. In order to derive a set of conditioning variables we rely on the poselet-based features that have been shown to be effective for people detection but have so far found limited application for articulated human pose estimation. We demon- strate the effectiveness of our approach on three publicly available pose estimation benchmarks improving or being on-par with state of the art in each case.</p><p>4 0.59159034 <a title="426-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Joint_Model_for_2D_and_3D_Pose_Estimation_from_a_Single_Image.html">14 cvpr-2013-A Joint Model for 2D and 3D Pose Estimation from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Edgar Simo-Serra, Ariadna Quattoni, Carme Torras, Francesc Moreno-Noguer</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to automatically recover 3D human pose from a single image. Most previous work follows a pipelined approach: initially, a set of 2D features such as edges, joints or silhouettes are detected in the image, and then these observations are used to infer the 3D pose. Solving these two problems separately may lead to erroneous 3D poses when the feature detector has performed poorly. In this paper, we address this issue by jointly solving both the 2D detection and the 3D inference problems. For this purpose, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates a generative model based on latent variables and discriminative 2D part detectors based on HOGs, and perform inference using evolutionary algorithms. Real experimentation demonstrates competitive results, and the ability of our methodology to provide accurate 2D and 3D pose estimations even when the 2D detectors are inaccurate.</p><p>5 0.5842182 <a title="426-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Optical_Flow_Estimation_Using_Laplacian_Mesh_Energy.html">316 cvpr-2013-Optical Flow Estimation Using Laplacian Mesh Energy</a></p>

<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Stefano Soatto, Shing-Tung Yau</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient approach to integrating non-local statistics into the higher-order Markov Random Fields (MRFs) framework. Motivated by the observation that many non-local statistics (e.g., shape priors, color distributions) can usually be represented by a small number of parameters, we reformulate the higher-order MRF model by introducing additional latent variables to represent the intrinsic dimensions of the higher-order cliques. The resulting new model, called NC-MRF, not only provides the flexibility in representing the configurations of higher-order cliques, but also automatically decomposes the energy function into less coupled terms, allowing us to design an efficient algorithmic framework for maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Based on this novel modeling/inference framework, we achieve state-of-the-art solutions to the challenging problems of class-specific image segmentation and template-based 3D facial expression tracking, which demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>3 0.63321388 <a title="426-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Joint_Geodesic_Upsampling_of_Depth_Images.html">232 cvpr-2013-Joint Geodesic Upsampling of Depth Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming-Yu Liu, Oncel Tuzel, Yuichi Taguchi</p><p>Abstract: We propose an algorithm utilizing geodesic distances to upsample a low resolution depth image using a registered high resolution color image. Specifically, it computes depth for each pixel in the high resolution image using geodesic paths to the pixels whose depths are known from the low resolution one. Though this is closely related to the all-pairshortest-path problem which has O(n2 log n) complexity, we develop a novel approximation algorithm whose complexity grows linearly with the image size and achieve realtime performance. We compare our algorithm with the state of the art on the benchmark dataset and show that our approach provides more accurate depth upsampling with fewer artifacts. In addition, we show that the proposed algorithm is well suited for upsampling depth images using binary edge maps, an important sensor fusion application.</p><p>4 0.62771255 <a title="426-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Groupwise_Registration_via_Graph_Shrinkage_on_the_Image_Manifold.html">194 cvpr-2013-Groupwise Registration via Graph Shrinkage on the Image Manifold</a></p>
<p>Author: Shihui Ying, Guorong Wu, Qian Wang, Dinggang Shen</p><p>Abstract: Recently, groupwise registration has been investigated for simultaneous alignment of all images without selecting any individual image as the template, thus avoiding the potential bias in image registration. However, none of current groupwise registration method fully utilizes the image distribution to guide the registration. Thus, the registration performance usually suffers from large inter-subject variations across individual images. To solve this issue, we propose a novel groupwise registration algorithm for large population dataset, guided by the image distribution on the manifold. Specifically, we first use a graph to model the distribution of all image data sitting on the image manifold, with each node representing an image and each edge representing the geodesic pathway between two nodes (or images). Then, the procedure of warping all images to theirpopulation center turns to the dynamic shrinking ofthe graph nodes along their graph edges until all graph nodes become close to each other. Thus, the topology ofimage distribution on the image manifold is always preserved during the groupwise registration. More importantly, by modeling , the distribution of all images via a graph, we can potentially reduce registration error since every time each image is warped only according to its nearby images with similar structures in the graph. We have evaluated our proposed groupwise registration method on both synthetic and real datasets, with comparison to the two state-of-the-art groupwise registration methods. All experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of registration accuracy and robustness.</p><p>5 0.62425482 <a title="426-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Image_Super-Resolution_Based_on_In-Place_Example_Regression.html">166 cvpr-2013-Fast Image Super-Resolution Based on In-Place Example Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianchao Yang, Zhe Lin, Scott Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a fast regression model for practical single image super-resolution based on in-place examples, by leveraging two fundamental super-resolution approaches— learning from an external database and learning from selfexamples. Our in-place self-similarity refines the recently proposed local self-similarity by proving that a patch in the upper scale image have good matches around its origin location in the lower scale image. Based on the in-place examples, a first-order approximation of the nonlinear mapping function from low- to high-resolution image patches is learned. Extensive experiments on benchmark and realworld images demonstrate that our algorithm can produce natural-looking results with sharp edges and preserved fine details, while the current state-of-the-art algorithms are prone to visual artifacts. Furthermore, our model can easily extend to deal with noise by combining the regression results on multiple in-place examples for robust estimation. The algorithm runs fast and is particularly useful for practical applications, where the input images typically contain diverse textures and they are potentially contaminated by noise or compression artifacts.</p><p>6 0.62026525 <a title="426-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Handling_Noise_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_Using_Directional_Filters.html">198 cvpr-2013-Handling Noise in Single Image Deblurring Using Directional Filters</a></p>

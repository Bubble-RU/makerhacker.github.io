<p>Author: Anelia Angelova, Shenghuo Zhu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a detection and segmentation algorithm for the purposes of fine-grained recognition. The algorithm first detects low-level regions that could potentially belong to the object and then performs a full-object segmentation through propagation. Apart from segmenting the object, we can also ‘zoom in ’ on the object, i.e. center it, normalize it for scale, and thus discount the effects of the background. We then show that combining this with a state-of-the-art classification algorithm leads to significant improvements in performance especially for datasets which are considered particularly hard for recognition, e.g. birds species. The proposed algorithm is much more efficient than other known methods in similar scenarios [4, 21]. Our method is also simpler and we apply it here to different classes of objects, e.g. birds, flowers, cats and dogs. We tested the algorithm on a number of benchmark datasets for fine-grained categorization. It outperforms all the known state-of-the-art methods on these datasets, sometimes by as much as 11%. It improves the performance of our baseline algorithm by 3-4%, consistently on all datasets. We also observed more than a 4% improvement in the recognition performance on a challenging largescale flower dataset, containing 578 species of flowers and 250,000 images.</p><p>3 0.25075915 <a title="452-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-POOF%3A_Part-Based_One-vs.-One_Features_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization%2C_Face_Verification%2C_and_Attribute_Estimation.html">323 cvpr-2013-POOF: Part-Based One-vs.-One Features for Fine-Grained Categorization, Face Verification, and Attribute Estimation</a></p>

For visual categories that exhibit high diversity in structure such as buildings, our approach can be used to discover parts that are hard to name, but can be easily expressed as a correspondence between pairs of images. Parts naturally emerge from point-wise landmark matches across many instances within a category.

<p>Author: Vishnu Naresh Boddeti, Takeo Kanade, B.V.K. Vijaya Kumar</p><p>Abstract: Alignment of 3D objects from 2D images is one of the most important and well studied problems in computer vision. A typical object alignment system consists of a landmark appearance model which is used to obtain an initial shape and a shape model which refines this initial shape by correcting the initialization errors. Since errors in landmark initialization from the appearance model propagate through the shape model, it is critical to have a robust landmark appearance model. While there has been much progress in designing sophisticated and robust shape models, there has been relatively less progress in designing robust landmark detection models. In thispaper wepresent an efficient and robust landmark detection model which is designed specifically to minimize localization errors thereby leading to state-of-the-art object alignment performance. We demonstrate the efficacy and speed of the proposed approach on the challenging task of multi-view car alignment.</p><p>6 0.098657385 <a title="452-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Label_Trees_for_Efficient_Large_Scale_Image_Classification.html">340 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Label Trees for Efficient Large Scale Image Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Alessandro Bergamo, Sudipta N. Sinha, Lorenzo Torresani</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new technique for learning a discriminative codebook for local feature descriptors, specifically designed for scalable landmark classification. The key contribution lies in exploiting the knowledge of correspondences within sets offeature descriptors during codebook learning. Feature correspondences are obtained using structure from motion (SfM) computation on Internet photo collections which serve as the training data. Our codebook is defined by a random forest that is trained to map corresponding feature descriptors into identical codes. Unlike prior forest-based codebook learning methods, we utilize fine-grained descriptor labels and address the challenge of training a forest with an extremely large number of labels. Our codebook is used with various existing feature encoding schemes and also a variant we propose for importanceweighted aggregation of local features. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset of 25 landmarks and our new dataset of 620 landmarks (614K images). Our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art in landmark classification. Furthermore, our method is memory efficient and scalable.</p><p>4 0.60731709 <a title="452-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-POOF%3A_Part-Based_One-vs.-One_Features_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization%2C_Face_Verification%2C_and_Attribute_Estimation.html">323 cvpr-2013-POOF: Part-Based One-vs.-One Features for Fine-Grained Categorization, Face Verification, and Attribute Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Luming Zhang, Mingli Song, Zicheng Liu, Xiao Liu, Jiajun Bu, Chun Chen</p><p>Abstract: Weakly supervised image segmentation is a challenging problem in computer vision field. In this paper, we present a new weakly supervised image segmentation algorithm by learning the distribution of spatially structured superpixel sets from image-level labels. Specifically, we first extract graphlets from each image where a graphlet is a smallsized graph consisting of superpixels as its nodes and it encapsulates the spatial structure of those superpixels. Then, a manifold embedding algorithm is proposed to transform graphlets of different sizes into equal-length feature vectors. Thereafter, we use GMM to learn the distribution of the post-embedding graphlets. Finally, we propose a novel image segmentation algorithm, called graphlet cut, that leverages the learned graphlet distribution in measuring the homogeneity of a set of spatially structured superpixels. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised image segmentation methods, and its performance is comparable to those of the fully supervised segmentation models.</p><p>3 0.57787967 <a title="452-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Motion_Estimation_for_Self-Driving_Cars_with_a_Generalized_Camera.html">290 cvpr-2013-Motion Estimation for Self-Driving Cars with a Generalized Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Gim Hee Lee, Friedrich Faundorfer, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a visual ego-motion estimation algorithm for a self-driving car equipped with a closeto-market multi-camera system. By modeling the multicamera system as a generalized camera and applying the non-holonomic motion constraint of a car, we show that this leads to a novel 2-point minimal solution for the generalized essential matrix where the full relative motion including metric scale can be obtained. We provide the analytical solutions for the general case with at least one inter-camera correspondence and a special case with only intra-camera correspondences. We show that up to a maximum of 6 solutions exist for both cases. We identify the existence of degeneracy when the car undergoes straight motion in the special case with only intra-camera correspondences where the scale becomes unobservable and provide a practical alternative solution. Our formulation can be efficiently implemented within RANSAC for robust estimation. We verify the validity of our assumptions on the motion model by comparing our results on a large real-world dataset collected by a car equipped with 4 cameras with minimal overlapping field-of-views against the GPS/INS ground truth.</p><p>4 0.5756669 <a title="452-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution_Shape_Analysis_via_Non-Euclidean_Wavelets%3A_Applications_to_Mesh_Segmentation_and_Surface_Alignment_Problems.html">297 cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution Shape Analysis via Non-Euclidean Wavelets: Applications to Mesh Segmentation and Surface Alignment Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Won Hwa Kim, Moo K. Chung, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of 3-D shape meshes is a fundamental problem in computer vision, graphics, and medical imaging. Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape ’s local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks). We give an extensive set of comparison results on a large shape segmentation benchmark and derive a uniqueness theorem for the surface alignment problem.</p><p>5 0.55447662 <a title="452-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Video_Editing_with_Temporal%2C_Spatial_and_Appearance_Consistency.html">453 cvpr-2013-Video Editing with Temporal, Spatial and Appearance Consistency</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojie Guo, Xiaochun Cao, Xiaowu Chen, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Given an area of interest in a video sequence, one may want to manipulate or edit the area, e.g. remove occlusions from or replace with an advertisement on it. Such a task involves three main challenges including temporal consistency, spatial pose, and visual realism. The proposed method effectively seeks an optimal solution to simultaneously deal with temporal alignment, pose rectification, as well as precise recovery of the occlusion. To make our method applicable to long video sequences, we propose a batch alignment method for automatically aligning and rectifying a small number of initial frames, and then show how to align the remaining frames incrementally to the aligned base images. From the error residual of the robust alignment process, we automatically construct a trimap of the region for each frame, which is used as the input to alpha matting methods to extract the occluding foreground. Experimental results on both simulated and real data demonstrate the accurate and robust performance of our method.</p><p>6 0.55034328 <a title="452-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Scene_Parsing_by_Integrating_Function%2C_Geometry_and_Appearance_Models.html">381 cvpr-2013-Scene Parsing by Integrating Function, Geometry and Appearance Models</a></p>

We present a hierarchical scene model for learning and reasoning about complex indoor scenes which is computationally tractable, can be learned from a reasonable amount of training data, and avoids oversimplification. At the core of this approach is the 3D Geometric Phrase Model which captures the semantic and geometric relationships between objects whichfrequently co-occur in the same 3D spatial configuration.

<p>Author: Gautam Singh, Jana Kosecka</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a nonparametric approach to semantic parsing using small patches and simple gradient, color and location features. We learn the relevance of individual feature channels at test time using a locally adaptive distance metric. To further improve the accuracy of the nonparametric approach, we examine the importance of the retrieval set used to compute the nearest neighbours using a novel semantic descriptor to retrieve better candidates. The approach is validated by experiments on several datasets used for semantic parsing demonstrating the superiority of the method compared to the state of art approaches.</p><p>4 0.19086687 <a title="173-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Integrating_Grammar_and_Segmentation_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">225 cvpr-2013-Integrating Grammar and Segmentation for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Brandon Rothrock, Seyoung Park, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a compositional and-or graph grammar model for human pose estimation. Our model has three distinguishing features: (i) large appearance differences between people are handled compositionally by allowingparts or collections ofparts to be substituted with alternative variants, (ii) each variant is a sub-model that can define its own articulated geometry and context-sensitive compatibility with neighboring part variants, and (iii) background region segmentation is incorporated into the part appearance models to better estimate the contrast of a part region from its surroundings, and improve resilience to background clutter. The resulting integrated framework is trained discriminatively in a max-margin framework using an efficient and exact inference algorithm. We present experimental evaluation of our model on two popular datasets, and show performance improvements over the state-of-art on both benchmarks.</p><p>5 0.18818334 <a title="173-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Exemplar-Based_Face_Parsing.html">152 cvpr-2013-Exemplar-Based Face Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Brandon M. Smith, Li Zhang, Jonathan Brandt, Zhe Lin, Jianchao Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we propose an exemplar-based face image segmentation algorithm. We take inspiration from previous works on image parsing for general scenes. Our approach assumes a database of exemplar face images, each of which is associated with a hand-labeled segmentation map. Given a test image, our algorithm first selects a subset of exemplar images from the database, Our algorithm then computes a nonrigid warp for each exemplar image to align it with the test image. Finally, we propagate labels from the exemplar images to the test image in a pixel-wise manner, using trained weights to modulate and combine label maps from different exemplars. We evaluate our method on two challenging datasets and compare with two face parsing algorithms and a general scene parsing algorithm. We also compare our segmentation results with contour-based face alignment results; that is, we first run the alignment algorithms to extract contour points and then derive segments from the contours. Our algorithm compares favorably with all previous works on all datasets evaluated.</p><p>6 0.16494153 <a title="173-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_a_Joint_Pixel-wise_and_Part-wise_Formulation.html">207 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using a Joint Pixel-wise and Part-wise Formulation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yibiao Zhao, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Indoor functional objects exhibit large view and appearance variations, thus are difficult to be recognized by the traditional appearance-based classification paradigm. In this paper, we present an algorithm to parse indoor images based on two observations: i) The functionality is the most essentialproperty to define an indoor object, e.g. “a chair to sit on ”; ii) The geometry (3D shape) ofan object is designed to serve its function. We formulate the nature of the object function into a stochastic grammar model. This model characterizes a joint distribution over the function-geometryappearance (FGA) hierarchy. The hierarchical structure includes a scene category, , functional groups, , functional objects, functional parts and 3D geometric shapes. We use a simulated annealing MCMC algorithm to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution, i.e. a parse tree. We design four data-driven steps to accelerate the search in the FGA space: i) group the line segments into 3D primitive shapes, ii) assign functional labels to these 3D primitive shapes, iii) fill in missing objects/parts according to the functional labels, and iv) synthesize 2D segmentation maps and verify the current parse tree by the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability. The experimental results on several challenging indoor datasets demonstrate theproposed approach not only significantly widens the scope ofindoor sceneparsing algorithm from the segmentation and the 3D recovery to the functional object recognition, but also yields improved overall performance.</p><p>4 0.70374388 <a title="173-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Understanding_Indoor_Scenes_Using_3D_Geometric_Phrases.html">446 cvpr-2013-Understanding Indoor Scenes Using 3D Geometric Phrases</a></p>

<p>Author: Sanja Fidler, Abhishek Sharma, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: We are interested in holistic scene understanding where images are accompanied with text in the form of complex sentential descriptions. We propose a holistic conditional random field model for semantic parsing which reasons jointly about which objects are present in the scene, their spatial extent as well as semantic segmentation, and employs text as well as image information as input. We automatically parse the sentences and extract objects and their relationships, and incorporate them into the model, both via potentials as well as by re-ranking candidate detections. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the challenging UIUC sentences dataset and show segmentation improvements of 12.5% over the visual only model and detection improvements of 5% AP over deformable part-based models [8].</p><p>6 0.69163728 <a title="173-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminatively_Trained_And-Or_Tree_Models_for_Object_Detection.html">136 cvpr-2013-Discriminatively Trained And-Or Tree Models for Object Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Ehsan Shahrian, Deepu Rajan, Brian Price, Scott Cohen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new image matting algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset of images. This is achieved by solving two major problems encountered by current sampling based algorithms. The first is that the range in which the foreground and background are sampled is often limited to such an extent that the true foreground and background colors are not present. Here, we describe a method by which a more comprehensive and representative set of samples is collected so as not to miss out on the true samples. This is accomplished by expanding the sampling range for pixels farther from the foreground or background boundary and ensuring that samples from each color distribution are included. The second problem is the overlap in color distributions of foreground and background regions. This causes sampling based methods to fail to pick the correct samples for foreground and background. Our design of an objective function forces those foreground and background samples to be picked that are generated from well-separated distributions. Comparison on the dataset at and evaluation by www.alphamatting.com shows that the proposed method ranks first in terms of error measures used in the website.</p><p>2 0.98338693 <a title="173-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Image_Matting_with_Local_and_Nonlocal_Smooth_Priors.html">211 cvpr-2013-Image Matting with Local and Nonlocal Smooth Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaowu Chen, Dongqing Zou, Steven Zhiying Zhou, Qinping Zhao, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel alpha matting method with local and nonlocal smooth priors. We observe that the manifold preserving editing propagation [4] essentially introduced a nonlocal smooth prior on the alpha matte. This nonlocal smooth prior and the well known local smooth priorfrom matting Laplacian complement each other. So we combine them with a simple data term from color sampling in a graph model for nature image matting. Our method has a closed-form solution and can be solved efficiently. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method produces more accurate results according to the evaluation on standard benchmark datasets.</p><p>3 0.9797712 <a title="173-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_and_Restricted_Motion_Subspaces_and_Their_Signatures.html">46 cvpr-2013-Articulated and Restricted Motion Subspaces and Their Signatures</a></p>
<p>Author: Bastien Jacquet, Roland Angst, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Articulated objects represent an important class ofobjects in our everyday environment. Automatic detection of the type of articulated or otherwise restricted motion and extraction of the corresponding motion parameters are therefore of high value, e.g. in order to augment an otherwise static 3D reconstruction with dynamic semantics, such as rotation axes and allowable translation directions for certain rigid parts or objects. Hence, in this paper, a novel theory to analyse relative transformations between two motion-restricted parts will be presented. The analysis is based on linear subspaces spanned by relative transformations. Moreover, a signature for relative transformations will be introduced which uniquely specifies the type of restricted motion encoded in these relative transformations. This theoretic framework enables the derivation of novel algebraic constraints, such as low-rank constraints for subsequent rotations around two fixed axes for example. Lastly, given the type of restricted motion as predicted by the signature, the paper shows how to extract all the motion parameters with matrix manipulations from linear algebra.

We formulate nonrigid structure from motion (NRSfM) as a global variational energy minimization problem to estimate dense low-rank smooth 3D shapes for every frame along with the camera motion matrices, given dense 2D correspondences. Unlike traditional factorization based approaches to NRSfM, which model the low-rank non-rigid shape using a fixed number of basis shapes and corresponding coefficients, we minimize the rank of the matrix of time-varying shapes directly via trace norm minimization. In conjunction with this low-rank constraint, we use an edge preserving total-variation regularization term to obtain spatially smooth shapes for every frame. Thanks to proximal splitting techniques the optimization problem can be decomposed into many point-wise sub-problems and simple linear systems which can be easily solved on GPU hardware. We show results on real sequences of different objects (face, torso, beating heart) where, despite challenges in tracking, illumination changes and occlusions, our method reconstructs highly deforming smooth surfaces densely and accurately directly from video, without the need for any prior models or shape templates.</p><p>5 0.92626923 <a title="173-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Illumination_Estimation_Based_on_Bilayer_Sparse_Coding.html">210 cvpr-2013-Illumination Estimation Based on Bilayer Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Li, Weihua Xiong, Weiming Hu, Houwen Peng</p><p>Abstract: Computational color constancy is a very important topic in computer vision and has attracted many researchers ’ attention. Recently, lots of research has shown the effects of using high level visual content cues for improving illumination estimation. However, nearly all the existing methods are essentially combinational strategies in which image ’s content analysis is only used to guide the combination or selection from a variety of individual illumination estimation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel bilayer sparse coding model for illumination estimation that considers image similarity in terms of both low level color distribution and high level image scene content simultaneously. For the purpose, the image ’s scene content information is integrated with its color distribution to obtain optimal illumination estimation model. The experimental results on real-world image sets show that our algorithm is superior to some prevailing illumination estimation methods, even better than some combinational methods.</p><p>6 0.90046066 <a title="173-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Thousand_Frames_in_Just_a_Few_Words%3A_Lingual_Description_of_Videos_through_Latent_Topics_and_Sparse_Object_Stitching.html">28 cvpr-2013-A Thousand Frames in Just a Few Words: Lingual Description of Videos through Latent Topics and Sparse Object Stitching</a></p>

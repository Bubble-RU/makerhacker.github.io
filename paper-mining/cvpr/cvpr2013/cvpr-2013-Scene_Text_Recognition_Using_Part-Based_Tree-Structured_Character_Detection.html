<p>Author: Tim Matthews, Mark S. Nixon, Mahesan Niranjan</p><p>Abstract: We argue for the importance of explicit semantic modelling in human-centred texture analysis tasks such as retrieval, annotation, synthesis, and zero-shot learning. To this end, low-level attributes are selected and used to define a semantic space for texture. 319 texture classes varying in illumination and rotation are positioned within this semantic space using a pairwise relative comparison procedure. Low-level visual features used by existing texture descriptors are then assessed in terms of their correspondence to the semantic space. Textures with strong presence ofattributes connoting randomness and complexity are shown to be poorly modelled by existing descriptors. In a retrieval experiment semantic descriptors are shown to outperform visual descriptors. Semantic modelling of texture is thus shown to provide considerable value in both feature selection and in analysis tasks.</p><p>3 0.13465276 <a title="382-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Fully-Connected_CRFs_with_Non-Parametric_Pairwise_Potential.html">180 cvpr-2013-Fully-Connected CRFs with Non-Parametric Pairwise Potential</a></p>
<p>Author: Neill D.F. Campbell, Kartic Subr, Jan Kautz</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are used for diverse tasks, ranging from image denoising to object recognition. For images, they are commonly defined as a graph with nodes corresponding to individual pixels and pairwise links that connect nodes to their immediate neighbors. Recent work has shown that fully-connected CRFs, where each node is connected to every other node, can be solved efficiently under the restriction that the pairwise term is a Gaussian kernel over a Euclidean feature space. In this paper, we generalize the pairwise terms to a non-linear dissimilarity measure that is not required to be a distance metric. To this end, we propose a density estimation technique to derive conditional pairwise potentials in a nonparametric manner. We then use an efficient embedding technique to estimate an approximate Euclidean feature space for these potentials, in which the pairwise term can still be expressed as a Gaussian kernel. We demonstrate that the use of non-parametric models for the pairwise interactions, conditioned on the input data, greatly increases expressive power whilst maintaining efficient inference.</p><p>4 0.13301742 <a title="382-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Analyzing_Semantic_Segmentation_Using_Hybrid_Human-Machine_CRFs.html">43 cvpr-2013-Analyzing Semantic Segmentation Using Hybrid Human-Machine CRFs</a></p>
<p>Author: Roozbeh Mottaghi, Sanja Fidler, Jian Yao, Raquel Urtasun, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Recent trends in semantic image segmentation have pushed for holistic scene understanding models that jointly reason about various tasks such as object detection, scene recognition, shape analysis, contextual reasoning. In this work, we are interested in understanding the roles of these different tasks in aiding semantic segmentation. Towards this goal, we “plug-in ” human subjects for each of the various components in a state-of-the-art conditional random field model (CRF) on the MSRC dataset. Comparisons among various hybrid human-machine CRFs give us indications of how much “head room ” there is to improve segmentation by focusing research efforts on each of the tasks. One of the interesting findings from our slew of studies was that human classification of isolated super-pixels, while being worse than current machine classifiers, provides a significant boost in performance when plugged into the CRF! Fascinated by this finding, we conducted in depth analysis of the human generated potentials. This inspired a new machine potential which significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on the MRSC dataset.</p><p>5 0.13235581 <a title="382-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>6 0.11839744 <a title="382-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Visual_Place_Recognition_with_Repetitive_Structures.html">456 cvpr-2013-Visual Place Recognition with Repetitive Structures</a></p>

A key contribution of our approach is the formulation and validation of a joint assignment optimization problem where multiple visual words and object instances of a potential recurring pattern are considered simultaneously. The optimization is achieved by a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) with moves specifically designed for fast convergence. We have quantified systematically the performance of our approach under stressed conditions of the input (missing features, geometric distortions). We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms state of the art methods for recurring pattern discovery on a diverse set of 400+ real world and synthesized test images.</p><p>3 0.70422333 <a title="382-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Fast_Approximate_AIB_Algorithm_for_Distributional_Word_Clustering.html">8 cvpr-2013-A Fast Approximate AIB Algorithm for Distributional Word Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Wang, Jianjia Zhang, Luping Zhou, Wanqing Li</p><p>Abstract: Distributional word clustering merges the words having similar probability distributions to attain reliable parameter estimation, compact classification models and even better classification performance. Agglomerative Information Bottleneck (AIB) is one of the typical word clustering algorithms and has been applied to both traditional text classification and recent image recognition. Although enjoying theoretical elegance, AIB has one main issue on its computational efficiency, especially when clustering a large number of words. Different from existing solutions to this issue, we analyze the characteristics of its objective function the loss of mutual information, and show that by merely using the ratio of word-class joint probabilities of each word, good candidate word pairs for merging can be easily identified. Based on this finding, we propose a fast approximate AIB algorithm and show that it can significantly improve the computational efficiency of AIB while well maintaining or even slightly increasing its classification performance. Experimental study on both text and image classification benchmark data sets shows that our algorithm can achieve more than 100 times speedup on large real data sets over the state-of-the-art method.</p><p>4 0.68949986 <a title="382-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>

We automatically parse the sentences and extract objects and their relationships, and incorporate them into the model, both via potentials as well as by re-ranking candidate detections.

<p>Author: Jinwei Ye, Yu Ji, Jingyi Yu</p><p>Abstract: A Manhattan World (MW) [3] is composed of planar surfaces and parallel lines aligned with three mutually orthogonal principal axes. Traditional MW understanding algorithms rely on geometry priors such as the vanishing points and reference (ground) planes for grouping coplanar structures. In this paper, we present a novel single-image MW reconstruction algorithm from the perspective of nonpinhole cameras. We show that by acquiring the MW using an XSlit camera, we can instantly resolve coplanarity ambiguities. Specifically, we prove that parallel 3D lines map to 2D curves in an XSlit image and they converge at an XSlit Vanishing Point (XVP). In addition, if the lines are coplanar, their curved images will intersect at a second common pixel that we call Coplanar Common Point (CCP). CCP is a unique image feature in XSlit cameras that does not exist in pinholes. We present a comprehensive theory to analyze XVPs and CCPs in a MW scene and study how to recover 3D geometry in a complex MW scene from XVPs and CCPs. Finally, we build a prototype XSlit camera by using two layers of cylindrical lenses. Experimental results × on both synthetic and real data show that our new XSlitcamera-based solution provides an effective and reliable solution for MW understanding.</p><p>2 0.8433879 <a title="382-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Templateless_Quasi-rigid_Shape_Modeling_with_Implicit_Loop-Closure.html">424 cvpr-2013-Templateless Quasi-rigid Shape Modeling with Implicit Loop-Closure</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming Zeng, Jiaxiang Zheng, Xuan Cheng, Xinguo Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for quasi-rigid objects modeling from a sequence of depth scans captured at different time instances. As quasi-rigid objects, such as human bodies, usually have shape motions during the capture procedure, it is difficult to reconstruct their geometries. We represent the shape motion by a deformation graph, and propose a model-to-partmethod to gradually integrate sampled points of depth scans into the deformation graph. Under an as-rigid-as-possible assumption, the model-to-part method can adjust the deformation graph non-rigidly, so as to avoid error accumulation in alignment, which also implicitly achieves loop-closure. To handle the drift and topological error for the deformation graph, two algorithms are introduced. First, we use a two-stage registration to largely keep the rigid motion part. Second, in the step of graph integration, we topology-adaptively integrate new parts and dynamically control the regularization effect of the deformation graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method by several depth sequences of quasi-rigid objects, and an application in human shape modeling.</p><p>3 0.83942878 <a title="382-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Selective_Transfer_Machine_for_Personalized_Facial_Action_Unit_Detection.html">385 cvpr-2013-Selective Transfer Machine for Personalized Facial Action Unit Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-Sheng Chu, Fernando De La Torre, Jeffery F. Cohn</p><p>Abstract: Automatic facial action unit (AFA) detection from video is a long-standing problem in facial expression analysis. Most approaches emphasize choices of features and classifiers. They neglect individual differences in target persons. People vary markedly in facial morphology (e.g., heavy versus delicate brows, smooth versus deeply etched wrinkles) and behavior. Individual differences can dramatically influence how well generic classifiers generalize to previously unseen persons. While a possible solution would be to train person-specific classifiers, that often is neither feasible nor theoretically compelling. The alternative that we propose is to personalize a generic classifier in an unsupervised manner (no additional labels for the test subjects are required). We introduce a transductive learning method, which we refer to Selective Transfer Machine (STM), to personalize a generic classifier by attenuating person-specific biases. STM achieves this effect by simultaneously learning a classifier and re-weighting the training samples that are most relevant to the test subject. To evaluate the effectiveness of STM, we compared STM to generic classifiers and to cross-domain learning methods in three major databases: CK+ [20], GEMEP-FERA [32] and RU-FACS [2]. STM outperformed generic classifiers in all.</p><p>4 0.81139731 <a title="382-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Active_Contours_with_Group_Similarity.html">33 cvpr-2013-Active Contours with Group Similarity</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaowei Zhou, Xiaojie Huang, James S. Duncan, Weichuan Yu</p><p>Abstract: Active contours are widely used in image segmentation. To cope with missing or misleading features in images, researchers have introduced various ways to model the prior of shapes and use the prior to constrain active contours. However, the shape prior is usually learnt from a large set of annotated data, which is not always accessible in practice. Moreover, it is often doubted that the existing shapes in the training set will be sufficient to model the new instance in the testing image. In this paper, we propose to use the group similarity of object shapes in multiple images as a prior to aid segmentation, which can be interpreted as an unsupervised approach of shape prior modeling. We show that the rank of the matrix consisting of multiple shapes is a good measure of the group similarity of the shapes, and the nuclear norm minimization is a simple and effective way to impose the proposed constraint on existing active contour models. Moreover, we develop a fast algorithm to solve the proposed model by using the accelerated proximal method. Experiments using echocardiographic image sequences acquired from acute canine experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can consistently improve the performance of active contour models and increase the robustness against image defects such as missing boundaries.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.80614686 <a title="382-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Scene_Text_Recognition_Using_Part-Based_Tree-Structured_Character_Detection.html">382 cvpr-2013-Scene Text Recognition Using Part-Based Tree-Structured Character Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Cunzhao Shi, Chunheng Wang, Baihua Xiao, Yang Zhang, Song Gao, Zhong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Scene text recognition has inspired great interests from the computer vision community in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel scene text recognition method using part-based tree-structured character detection. Different from conventional multi-scale sliding window character detection strategy, which does not make use of the character-specific structure information, we use part-based tree-structure to model each type of character so as to detect and recognize the characters at the same time. While for word recognition, we build a Conditional Random Field model on the potential character locations to incorporate the detection scores, spatial constraints and linguistic knowledge into one framework. The final word recognition result is obtained by minimizing the cost function defined on the random field. Experimental results on a range of challenging public datasets (ICDAR 2003, ICDAR 2011, SVT) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms stateof-the-art methods significantly bothfor character detection and word recognition.</p><p>6 0.7716679 <a title="382-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Detection-_and_Trajectory-Level_Exclusion_in_Multiple_Object_Tracking.html">121 cvpr-2013-Detection- and Trajectory-Level Exclusion in Multiple Object Tracking</a></p>

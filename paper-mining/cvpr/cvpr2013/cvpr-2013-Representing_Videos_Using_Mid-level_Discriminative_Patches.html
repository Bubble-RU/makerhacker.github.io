<p>Author: Maria Zontak, Inbar Mosseri, Michal Irani</p><p>Abstract: Recurrence of small clean image patches across different scales of a natural image has been successfully used for solving ill-posed problems in clean images (e.g., superresolution from a single image). In this paper we show how this multi-scale property can be extended to solve ill-posed problems under noisy conditions, such as image denoising. While clean patches are obscured by severe noise in the original scale of a noisy image, noise levels drop dramatically at coarser image scales. This allows for the unknown hidden clean patches to “naturally emerge ” in some coarser scale of the noisy image. We further show that patch recurrence across scales is strengthened when using directional pyramids (that blur and subsample only in one direction). Our statistical experiments show that for almost any noisy image patch (more than 99%), there exists a “good” clean version of itself at the same relative image coordinates in some coarser scale of the image.This is a strong phenomenon of noise-contaminated natural images, which can serve as a strong prior for separating the signal from the noise. Finally, incorporating this multi-scale prior into a simple denoising algorithm yields state-of-the-art denois- ing results.</p><p>3 0.30872378 <a title="355-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Sampling_Strategies_for_Real-Time_Action_Recognition.html">378 cvpr-2013-Sampling Strategies for Real-Time Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Feng Shi, Emil Petriu, Robert Laganière</p><p>Abstract: Local spatio-temporal features and bag-of-features representations have become popular for action recognition. A recent trend is to use dense sampling for better performance. While many methods claimed to use dense feature sets, most of them are just denser than approaches based on sparse interest point detectors. In this paper, we explore sampling with high density on action recognition. We also investigate the impact of random sampling over dense grid for computational efficiency. We present a real-time action recognition system which integrates fast random sampling method with local spatio-temporal features extracted from a Local Part Model. A new method based on histogram intersection kernel is proposed to combine multiple channels of different descriptors. Our technique shows high accuracy on the simple KTH dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art on two very challenging real-world datasets, namely, 93% on KTH, 83.3% on UCF50 and 47.6% on HMDB51.</p><p>4 0.28823221 <a title="355-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-What_Makes_a_Patch_Distinct%3F.html">464 cvpr-2013-What Makes a Patch Distinct?</a></p>
<p>Author: Ran Margolin, Ayellet Tal, Lihi Zelnik-Manor</p><p>Abstract: What makes an object salient? Most previous work assert that distinctness is the dominating factor. The difference between the various algorithms is in the way they compute distinctness. Some focus on the patterns, others on the colors, and several add high-level cues and priors. We propose a simple, yet powerful, algorithm that integrates these three factors. Our key contribution is a novel and fast approach to compute pattern distinctness. We rely on the inner statistics of the patches in the image for identifying unique patterns. We provide an extensive evaluation and show that our approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the five most commonly-used datasets.</p><p>5 0.23307636 <a title="355-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Joint_Sparsity-Based_Representation_and_Analysis_of_Unconstrained_Activities.html">233 cvpr-2013-Joint Sparsity-Based Representation and Analysis of Unconstrained Activities</a></p>
<p>Author: Raghuraman Gopalan</p><p>Abstract: While the notion of joint sparsity in understanding common and innovative components of a multi-receiver signal ensemble has been well studied, we investigate the utility of such joint sparse models in representing information contained in a single video signal. By decomposing the content of a video sequence into that observed by multiple spatially and/or temporally distributed receivers, we first recover a collection of common and innovative components pertaining to individual videos. We then present modeling strategies based on subspace-driven manifold metrics to characterize patterns among these components, across other videos in the system, to perform subsequent video analysis. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for activity classification and clustering by reporting competitive results on standard datasets such as, HMDB, UCF-50, Olympic Sports and KTH.</p><p>6 0.23025136 <a title="355-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Image_Super-Resolution_Based_on_In-Place_Example_Regression.html">166 cvpr-2013-Fast Image Super-Resolution Based on In-Place Example Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Jianchao Yang, Zhe Lin, Scott Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a fast regression model for practical single image super-resolution based on in-place examples, by leveraging two fundamental super-resolution approaches— learning from an external database and learning from selfexamples. Our in-place self-similarity refines the recently proposed local self-similarity by proving that a patch in the upper scale image have good matches around its origin location in the lower scale image. Based on the in-place examples, a first-order approximation of the nonlinear mapping function from low- to high-resolution image patches is learned. Extensive experiments on benchmark and realworld images demonstrate that our algorithm can produce natural-looking results with sharp edges and preserved fine details, while the current state-of-the-art algorithms are prone to visual artifacts. Furthermore, our model can easily extend to deal with noise by combining the regression results on multiple in-place examples for robust estimation. The algorithm runs fast and is particularly useful for practical applications, where the input images typically contain diverse textures and they are potentially contaminated by noise or compression artifacts.</p><p>5 0.75039601 <a title="355-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Sparse_Quantization_for_Patch_Description.html">404 cvpr-2013-Sparse Quantization for Patch Description</a></p>
<p>Author: Xavier Boix, Michael Gygli, Gemma Roig, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: The representation of local image patches is crucial for the good performance and efficiency of many vision tasks. Patch descriptors have been designed to generalize towards diverse variations, depending on the application, as well as the desired compromise between accuracy and efficiency. We present a novel formulation of patch description, that serves such issues well. Sparse quantization lies at its heart. This allows for efficient encodings, leading to powerful, novel binary descriptors, yet also to the generalization of existing descriptors like SIFTorBRIEF. We demonstrate the capabilities of our formulation for both keypoint matching and image classification. Our binary descriptors achieve state-of-the-art results for two keypoint matching benchmarks, namely those by Brown [6] and Mikolajczyk [18]. For image classification, we propose new descriptors that perform similar to SIFT on Caltech101 [10] and PASCAL VOC07 [9].</p><p>6 0.71309572 <a title="355-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-What_Makes_a_Patch_Distinct%3F.html">464 cvpr-2013-What Makes a Patch Distinct?</a></p>

<p>Author: Yingying Zhu, Nandita M. Nayak, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury</p><p>Abstract: In thispaper, rather than modeling activities in videos individually, we propose a hierarchical framework that jointly models and recognizes related activities using motion and various context features. This is motivated from the observations that the activities related in space and time rarely occur independently and can serve as the context for each other. Given a video, action segments are automatically detected using motion segmentation based on a nonlinear dynamical model. We aim to merge these segments into activities of interest and generate optimum labels for the activities. Towards this goal, we utilize a structural model in a max-margin framework that jointly models the underlying activities which are related in space and time. The model explicitly learns the duration, motion and context patterns for each activity class, as well as the spatio-temporal relationships for groups of them. The learned model is then used to optimally label the activities in the testing videos using a greedy search method.

Extracting hand regions in ego-centric videos is a critical step for understanding handobject manipulation and analyzing hand-eye coordination. However, in contrast to traditional applications of hand detection, such as gesture interfaces or sign-language recognition, ego-centric videos present new challenges such as rapid changes in illuminations, significant camera motion and complex hand-object manipulations. To quantify the challenges and performance in this new domain, we present a fully labeled indoor/outdoor ego-centric hand detection benchmark dataset containing over 200 million labeled pixels, which contains hand images taken under various illumination conditions. Using both our dataset and a publicly available ego-centric indoors dataset, we give extensive analysis of detection performance using a wide range of local appearance features. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of sparse features and the importance of modeling global illumination. We propose a modeling strategy based on our findings and show that our model outperforms several baseline approaches.</p><p>4 0.99386615 <a title="355-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Blocks_That_Shout%3A_Distinctive_Parts_for_Scene_Classification.html">67 cvpr-2013-Blocks That Shout: Distinctive Parts for Scene Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Mayank Juneja, Andrea Vedaldi, C.V. Jawahar, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: The automatic discovery of distinctive parts for an object or scene class is challenging since it requires simultaneously to learn the part appearance and also to identify the part occurrences in images. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient, and effective method to do so. We address this problem by learning parts incrementally, starting from a single part occurrence with an Exemplar SVM. In this manner, additional part instances are discovered and aligned reliably before being considered as training examples. We also propose entropy-rank curves as a means of evaluating the distinctiveness of parts shareable between categories and use them to select useful parts out of a set of candidates. We apply the new representation to the task of scene categorisation on the MIT Scene 67 benchmark. We show that our method can learn parts which are significantly more informative and for a fraction of the cost, compared to previouspart-learning methods such as Singh et al. [28]. We also show that a well constructed bag of words or Fisher vector model can substantially outperform the previous state-of- the-art classification performance on this data.</p><p>5 0.99169308 <a title="355-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Generalized_Domain-Adaptive_Dictionaries.html">185 cvpr-2013-Generalized Domain-Adaptive Dictionaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Sumit Shekhar, Vishal M. Patel, Hien V. Nguyen, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: Data-driven dictionaries have produced state-of-the-art results in various classification tasks. However, when the target data has a different distribution than the source data, the learned sparse representation may not be optimal. In this paper, we investigate if it is possible to optimally represent both source and target by a common dictionary. Specifically, we describe a technique which jointly learns projections of data in the two domains, and a latent dictionary which can succinctly represent both the domains in the projected low-dimensional space. An efficient optimization technique is presented, which can be easily kernelized and extended to multiple domains. The algorithm is modified to learn a common discriminative dictionary, which can be further used for classification. The proposed approach does not require any explicit correspondence between the source and target domains, and shows good results even when there are only a few labels available in the target domain. Various recognition experiments show that the methodperforms onparor better than competitive stateof-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.99047434 <a title="355-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-GRASP_Recurring_Patterns_from_a_Single_View.html">183 cvpr-2013-GRASP Recurring Patterns from a Single View</a></p>

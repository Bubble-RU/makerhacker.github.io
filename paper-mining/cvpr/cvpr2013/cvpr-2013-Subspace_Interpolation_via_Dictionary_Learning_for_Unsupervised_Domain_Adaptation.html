<p>Author: Jeff Donahue, Judy Hoffman, Erik Rodner, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Most successful object classification and detection methods rely on classifiers trained on large labeled datasets. However, for domains where labels are limited, simply borrowing labeled data from existing datasets can hurt performance, a phenomenon known as “dataset bias.” We propose a general framework for adapting classifiers from “borrowed” data to the target domain using a combination of available labeled and unlabeled examples. Specifically, we show that imposing smoothness constraints on the classifier scores over the unlabeled data can lead to improved adaptation results. Such constraints are often available in the form of instance correspondences, e.g. when the same object or individual is observed simultaneously from multiple views, or tracked between video frames. In these cases, the object labels are unknown but can be constrained to be the same or similar. We propose techniques that build on existing domain adaptation methods by explicitly modeling these relationships, and demonstrate empirically that they improve recognition accuracy in two scenarios, multicategory image classification and object detection in video.</p><p>4 0.37209329 <a title="419-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Event_Recognition_in_Videos_by_Learning_from_Heterogeneous_Web_Sources.html">150 cvpr-2013-Event Recognition in Videos by Learning from Heterogeneous Web Sources</a></p>
<p>Author: Lin Chen, Lixin Duan, Dong Xu</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we propose to leverage a large number of loosely labeled web videos (e.g., from YouTube) and web images (e.g., from Google/Bing image search) for visual event recognition in consumer videos without requiring any labeled consumer videos. We formulate this task as a new multi-domain adaptation problem with heterogeneous sources, in which the samples from different source domains can be represented by different types of features with different dimensions (e.g., the SIFTfeaturesfrom web images and space-time (ST) features from web videos) while the target domain samples have all types of features. To effectively cope with the heterogeneous sources where some source domains are more relevant to the target domain, we propose a new method called Multi-domain Adaptation with Heterogeneous Sources (MDA-HS) to learn an optimal target classifier, in which we simultaneously seek the optimal weights for different source domains with different types of features as well as infer the labels of unlabeled target domain data based on multiple types of features. We solve our optimization problem by using the cutting-plane algorithm based on group-based multiple kernel learning. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MDA-HS for event recognition in consumer videos.</p><p>5 0.28205937 <a title="419-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Beta_Process_Joint_Dictionary_Learning_for_Coupled_Feature_Spaces_with_Application_to_Single_Image_Super-Resolution.html">58 cvpr-2013-Beta Process Joint Dictionary Learning for Coupled Feature Spaces with Application to Single Image Super-Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Li He, Hairong Qi, Russell Zaretzki</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning overcomplete dictionaries for the coupled feature spaces, where the learned dictionaries also reflect the relationship between the two spaces. A Bayesian method using a beta process prior is applied to learn the over-complete dictionaries. Compared to previous couple feature spaces dictionary learning algorithms, our algorithm not only provides dictionaries that customized to each feature space, but also adds more consistent and accurate mapping between the two feature spaces. This is due to the unique property of the beta process model that the sparse representation can be decomposed to values and dictionary atom indicators. The proposed algorithm is able to learn sparse representations that correspond to the same dictionary atoms with the same sparsity but different values in coupled feature spaces, thus bringing consistent and accurate mapping between coupled feature spaces. Another advantage of the proposed method is that the number of dictionary atoms and their relative importance may be inferred non-parametrically. We compare the proposed approach to several state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods super-resolution. tionaries learned resolution results ods. by applying this method to single image The experimental results show that dicby our method produces the best supercompared to other state-of-the-art meth-</p><p>6 0.27569997 <a title="419-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Separable_Dictionary_Learning.html">392 cvpr-2013-Separable Dictionary Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Ilja Kuzborskij, Francesco Orabona, Barbara Caputo</p><p>Abstract: Since the seminal work of Thrun [17], the learning to learnparadigm has been defined as the ability ofan agent to improve its performance at each task with experience, with the number of tasks. Within the object categorization domain, the visual learning community has actively declined this paradigm in the transfer learning setting. Almost all proposed methods focus on category detection problems, addressing how to learn a new target class from few samples by leveraging over the known source. But if one thinks oflearning over multiple tasks, there is a needfor multiclass transfer learning algorithms able to exploit previous source knowledge when learning a new class, while at the same time optimizing their overall performance. This is an open challenge for existing transfer learning algorithms. The contribution of this paper is a discriminative method that addresses this issue, based on a Least-Squares Support Vector Machine formulation. Our approach is designed to balance between transferring to the new class and preserving what has already been learned on the source models. Exten- sive experiments on subsets of publicly available datasets prove the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>6 0.56968528 <a title="419-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Cross-View_Action_Recognition_via_a_Continuous_Virtual_Path.html">98 cvpr-2013-Cross-View Action Recognition via a Continuous Virtual Path</a></p>

<p>Author: Jie Ni, Qiang Qiu, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation addresses the problem where data instances of a source domain have different distributions from that of a target domain, which occurs frequently in many real life scenarios. This work focuses on unsupervised domain adaptation, where labeled data are only available in the source domain. We propose to interpolate subspaces through dictionary learning to link the source and target domains. These subspaces are able to capture the intrinsic domain shift and form a shared feature representation for cross domain recognition. Further, we introduce a quantitative measure to characterize the shift between two domains, which enables us to select the optimal domain to adapt to the given multiple source domains. We present exumd .edu , rama@umiacs .umd .edu training and testing data are captured from the same underlying distribution. Yet this assumption is often violated in many real life applications. For instance, images collected from an internet search engine are compared with those captured from real life [28, 4]. Face recognition systems trained on frontal and high resolution images, are applied to probe images with non-frontal poses and low resolution [6]. Human actions are recognized from an unseen target view using training data taken from source views [21, 20]. We show some examples of dataset shifts in Figure 1. In these scenarios, magnitudes of variations of innate characteristics, which distinguish one class from another, are oftentimes smaller than the variations caused by distribution shift between training and testing dataset. Directly applying the classifier from the training set to testing set periments on face recognition across pose, illumination and blur variations, cross dataset object recognition, and report improved performance over the state of the art.</p><p>2 0.95473206 <a title="419-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Spatiotemporal_Deformable_Part_Models_for_Action_Detection.html">408 cvpr-2013-Spatiotemporal Deformable Part Models for Action Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Yicong Tian, Rahul Sukthankar, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: Deformable part models have achieved impressive performance for object detection, even on difficult image datasets. This paper explores the generalization of deformable part models from 2D images to 3D spatiotemporal volumes to better study their effectiveness for action detection in video. Actions are treated as spatiotemporal patterns and a deformable part model is generated for each action from a collection of examples. For each action model, the most discriminative 3D subvolumes are automatically selected as parts and the spatiotemporal relations between their locations are learned. By focusing on the most distinctive parts of each action, our models adapt to intra-class variation and show robustness to clutter. Extensive experiments on several video datasets demonstrate the strength of spatiotemporal DPMs for classifying and localizing actions.</p><p>3 0.95411885 <a title="419-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Leveraging_Structure_from_Motion_to_Learn_Discriminative_Codebooks_for_Scalable_Landmark_Classification.html">268 cvpr-2013-Leveraging Structure from Motion to Learn Discriminative Codebooks for Scalable Landmark Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Alessandro Bergamo, Sudipta N. Sinha, Lorenzo Torresani</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new technique for learning a discriminative codebook for local feature descriptors, specifically designed for scalable landmark classification. The key contribution lies in exploiting the knowledge of correspondences within sets offeature descriptors during codebook learning. Feature correspondences are obtained using structure from motion (SfM) computation on Internet photo collections which serve as the training data. Our codebook is defined by a random forest that is trained to map corresponding feature descriptors into identical codes. Unlike prior forest-based codebook learning methods, we utilize fine-grained descriptor labels and address the challenge of training a forest with an extremely large number of labels. Our codebook is used with various existing feature encoding schemes and also a variant we propose for importanceweighted aggregation of local features. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset of 25 landmarks and our new dataset of 620 landmarks (614K images). Our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art in landmark classification. Furthermore, our method is memory efficient and scalable.</p><p>4 0.95285261 <a title="419-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Improving_an_Object_Detector_and_Extracting_Regions_Using_Superpixels.html">217 cvpr-2013-Improving an Object Detector and Extracting Regions Using Superpixels</a></p>
<p>Author: Guang Shu, Afshin Dehghan, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to improve the detection performance of a generic detector when it is applied to a particular video. The performance of offline-trained objects detectors are usually degraded in unconstrained video environments due to variant illuminations, backgrounds and camera viewpoints. Moreover, most object detectors are trained using Haar-like features or gradient features but ignore video specificfeatures like consistent colorpatterns. In our approach, we apply a Superpixel-based Bag-of-Words (BoW) model to iteratively refine the output of a generic detector. Compared to other related work, our method builds a video-specific detector using superpixels, hence it can handle the problem of appearance variation. Most importantly, using Conditional Random Field (CRF) along with our super pixel-based BoW model, we develop and algorithm to segment the object from the background . Therefore our method generates an output of the exact object regions instead of the bounding boxes generated by most detectors. In general, our method takes detection bounding boxes of a generic detector as input and generates the detection output with higher average precision and precise object regions. The experiments on four recent datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and significantly improves the state-of-art detector by 5-16% in average precision.</p><p>5 0.95244873 <a title="419-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Evaluation_of_Color_STIPs_for_Human_Action_Recognition.html">149 cvpr-2013-Evaluation of Color STIPs for Human Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivo Everts, Jan C. van_Gemert, Theo Gevers</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with recognizing realistic human actions in videos based on spatio-temporal interest points (STIPs). Existing STIP-based action recognition approaches operate on intensity representations of the image data. Because of this, these approaches are sensitive to disturbing photometric phenomena such as highlights and shadows. Moreover, valuable information is neglected by discarding chromaticity from the photometric representation. These issues are addressed by Color STIPs. Color STIPs are multi-channel reformulations of existing intensity-based STIP detectors and descriptors, for which we consider a number of chromatic representations derived from the opponent color space. This enhanced modeling of appearance improves the quality of subsequent STIP detection and description. Color STIPs are shown to substantially outperform their intensity-based counterparts on the challenging UCF sports, UCF11 and UCF50 action recognition benchmarks. Moreover, the results show that color STIPs are currently the single best low-level feature choice for STIP-based approaches to human action recognition.</p><p>6 0.95207644 <a title="419-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Structured_Hough_Voting_for_Joint_Object_Detection_and_Occlusion_Reasoning.html">256 cvpr-2013-Learning Structured Hough Voting for Joint Object Detection and Occlusion Reasoning</a></p>

<p>Author: Dan Levi, Shai Silberstein, Aharon Bar-Hillel</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present a new part-based object detection algorithm with hundreds of parts performing realtime detection. Part-based models are currently state-ofthe-art for object detection due to their ability to represent large appearance variations. However, due to their high computational demands such methods are limited to several parts only and are too slow for practical real-time implementation. Our algorithm is an accelerated version of the “Feature Synthesis ” (FS) method [1], which uses multiple object parts for detection and is among state-of-theart methods on human detection benchmarks, but also suffers from a high computational cost. The proposed Accelerated Feature Synthesis (AFS) uses several strategies for reducing the number of locations searched for each part. The first strategy uses a novel algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search which we developed, termed “KDFerns ”, to compare each image location to only a subset of the model parts. Candidate part locations for a specific part are further reduced using spatial inhibition, and using an object-level “coarse-to-fine ” strategy. In our empirical evaluation on pedestrian detection benchmarks, AFS main- × tains almost fully the accuracy performance of the original FS, while running more than 4 faster than existing partbased methods which use only several parts. AFS is to our best knowledge the first part-based object detection method achieving real-time running performance: nearly 10 frames per-second on 640 480 images on a regular CPU.</p><p>3 0.25345102 <a title="52-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Genetic_Algorithm-Based_Solver_for_Very_Large_Jigsaw_Puzzles.html">11 cvpr-2013-A Genetic Algorithm-Based Solver for Very Large Jigsaw Puzzles</a></p>

<p>Author: Ramakrishna Kakarala, Prabhu Kaliamoorthi, Vittal Premachandran</p><p>Abstract: We show that bilateral symmetry plane estimation for three-dimensional (3-D) shapes may be carried out accurately, and efficiently, in the spherical harmonic domain. Our methods are valuable for applications where spherical harmonic expansion is already employed, such as 3-D shape registration, morphometry, and retrieval. We show that the presence of bilateral symmetry in the 3-D shape is equivalent to a linear phase structure in the corresponding spherical harmonic coefficients, and provide algorithms for estimating the orientation of the symmetry plane. The benefit of using spherical harmonic phase is that symmetry estimation reduces to matching a compact set of descriptors, without the need to solve a correspondence problem. Our methods work on point clouds as well as large-scale mesh models of 3-D shapes.</p><p>5 0.11689191 <a title="52-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-scale_Curve_Detection_on_Surfaces.html">298 cvpr-2013-Multi-scale Curve Detection on Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Kolomenkin, Ilan Shimshoni, Ayellet Tal</p><p>Abstract: This paper extends to surfaces the multi-scale approach of edge detection on images. The common practice for detecting curves on surfaces requires the user to first select the scale of the features, apply an appropriate smoothing, and detect the edges on the smoothed surface. This approach suffers from two drawbacks. First, it relies on a hidden assumption that all the features on the surface are of the same scale. Second, manual user intervention is required. In this paper, we propose a general framework for automatically detecting the optimal scale for each point on the surface. We smooth the surface at each point according to this optimal scale and run the curve detection algorithm on the resulting surface. Our multi-scale algorithm solves the two disadvantages of the single-scale approach mentioned above. We demonstrate how to realize our approach on two commonly-used special cases: ridges & valleys and relief edges. In each case, the optimal scale is found in accordance with the mathematical definition of the curve.</p><p>6 0.10630821 <a title="52-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_and_Restricted_Motion_Subspaces_and_Their_Signatures.html">46 cvpr-2013-Articulated and Restricted Motion Subspaces and Their Signatures</a></p>

<p>Author: Ajay Kumar, Cyril Kwong</p><p>Abstract: In order to avail the benefits of higher user convenience, hygiene, and improved accuracy, contactless 3D fingerprint recognition techniques have recently been introduced. One of the key limitations of these emerging 3D fingerprint technologies to replace the conventional 2D fingerprint system is their bulk and high cost, which mainly results from the use of multiple imaging cameras or structured lighting employed in these systems. This paper details the development of a contactless 3D fingerprint identification system that uses only single camera. We develop a new representation of 3D finger surface features using Finger Surface Codes and illustrate its effectiveness in matching 3D fingerprints. Conventional minutiae representation is extended in 3D space to accurately match the recovered 3D minutiae. Multiple 2D fingerprint images (with varying illumination profile) acquired to build 3D fingerprints can themselves be used recover 2D features for further improving 3D fingerprint identification and has been illustrated in this paper. The experimental results are shown on a database of 240 client fingerprints and confirm the advantages of the single camera based 3D fingerprint identification.</p><p>6 0.58269542 <a title="52-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Mirror_Surface_Reconstruction_from_a_Single_Image.html">286 cvpr-2013-Mirror Surface Reconstruction from a Single Image</a></p>

Further growth of configurations is based on adding remaining fragments such that their APC and break curves are consistent with those of a configuration. The method is novel, more robust and handles the largest numbers of fragments to date.</p><p>2 0.77624661 <a title="52-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Discovering_the_Structure_of_a_Planar_Mirror_System_from_Multiple_Observations_of_a_Single_Point.html">127 cvpr-2013-Discovering the Structure of a Planar Mirror System from Multiple Observations of a Single Point</a></p>
<p>Author: Ilya Reshetouski, Alkhazur Manakov, Ayush Bandhari, Ramesh Raskar, Hans-Peter Seidel, Ivo Ihrke</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying the position of a viewer inside a room of planar mirrors with unknown geometry in conjunction with the room’s shape parameters. We consider the observations to consist of angularly resolved depth measurements of a single scene point that is being observed via many multi-bounce interactions with the specular room geometry. Applications of this problem statement include areas such as calibration, acoustic echo cancelation and time-of-flight imaging. We theoretically analyze the problem and derive sufficient conditions for a combination of convex room geometry, observer, and scene point to be reconstructable. The resulting constructive algorithm is exponential in nature and, therefore, not directly applicable to practical scenarios. To counter the situation, we propose theoretically devised geometric constraints that enable an efficient pruning of the solution space and develop a heuristic randomized search algorithm that uses these constraints to obtain an effective solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on extensive simulations as well as in a challenging real-world calibration scenario.</p><p>3 0.7742753 <a title="52-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Decoding%2C_Calibration_and_Rectification_for_Lenselet-Based_Plenoptic_Cameras.html">102 cvpr-2013-Decoding, Calibration and Rectification for Lenselet-Based Plenoptic Cameras</a></p>
<p>Author: Donald G. Dansereau, Oscar Pizarro, Stefan B. Williams</p><p>Abstract: Plenoptic cameras are gaining attention for their unique light gathering and post-capture processing capabilities. We describe a decoding, calibration and rectification procedurefor lenselet-basedplenoptic cameras appropriatefor a range of computer vision applications. We derive a novel physically based 4D intrinsic matrix relating each recorded pixel to its corresponding ray in 3D space. We further propose a radial distortion model and a practical objective function based on ray reprojection. Our 15-parameter camera model is of much lower dimensionality than camera array models, and more closely represents the physics of lenselet-based cameras. Results include calibration of a commercially available camera using three calibration grid sizes over five datasets. Typical RMS ray reprojection errors are 0.0628, 0.105 and 0.363 mm for 3.61, 7.22 and 35.1 mm calibration grids, respectively. Rectification examples include calibration targets and real-world imagery.</p><p>4 0.77426296 <a title="52-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Three-Dimensional_Bilateral_Symmetry_Plane_Estimation_in_the_Phase_Domain.html">432 cvpr-2013-Three-Dimensional Bilateral Symmetry Plane Estimation in the Phase Domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Ramakrishna Kakarala, Prabhu Kaliamoorthi, Vittal Premachandran</p><p>Abstract: We show that bilateral symmetry plane estimation for three-dimensional (3-D) shapes may be carried out accurately, and efficiently, in the spherical harmonic domain. Our methods are valuable for applications where spherical harmonic expansion is already employed, such as 3-D shape registration, morphometry, and retrieval. We show that the presence of bilateral symmetry in the 3-D shape is equivalent to a linear phase structure in the corresponding spherical harmonic coefficients, and provide algorithms for estimating the orientation of the symmetry plane. The benefit of using spherical harmonic phase is that symmetry estimation reduces to matching a compact set of descriptors, without the need to solve a correspondence problem. Our methods work on point clouds as well as large-scale mesh models of 3-D shapes.</p><p>5 0.763538 <a title="52-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-view_Photometric_Stereo_with_Spatially_Varying_Isotropic_Materials.html">303 cvpr-2013-Multi-view Photometric Stereo with Spatially Varying Isotropic Materials</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenglong Zhou, Zhe Wu, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to capture both 3D shape and spatially varying reflectance with a multi-view photometric stereo technique that works for general isotropic materials. Our data capture setup is simple, which consists of only a digital camera and a handheld light source. From a single viewpoint, we use a set of photometric stereo images to identify surface points with the same distance to the camera. We collect this information from multiple viewpoints and combine it with structure-from-motion to obtain a precise reconstruction of the complete 3D shape. The spatially varying isotropic bidirectional reflectance distributionfunction (BRDF) is captured by simultaneously inferring a set of basis BRDFs and their mixing weights at each surface point. According to our experiments, the captured shapes are accurate to 0.3 millimeters. The captured reflectance has relative root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 9%.</p><p>6 0.76338685 <a title="52-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Motion_Estimation_for_Self-Driving_Cars_with_a_Generalized_Camera.html">290 cvpr-2013-Motion Estimation for Self-Driving Cars with a Generalized Camera</a></p>

</p><p>6 For reassembling multiple pots with or without missing pieces, our algorithm estimates the APC  from each fragment, then reassembles into configurations the ones having distinctive APC. [sent-13, score-0.397]
</p><p>7 Further growth of configurations is based on adding remaining fragments such that their APC and break curves are consistent with those of a configuration. [sent-14, score-0.816]
</p><p>8 The method is novel, more robust and handles the largest numbers of fragments to date. [sent-15, score-0.413]
</p><p>9 However, the fragments are commonly found mixed in very large numbers as a giant 3D puzzle. [sent-24, score-0.413]
</p><p>10 [6] detect break surfaces and reestablish their connections by corresponding robust geometric descriptors and avoiding fragment intersection. [sent-38, score-0.632]
</p><p>11 A solution is presented with focus on ceramic fragments from axially symmetric pottery (solids of revolution). [sent-40, score-0.645]
</p><p>12 The proposed method is designed to completely configure multiple pots from arbitrary fragments based on the knowledge of their outer surface. [sent-41, score-0.796]
</p><p>13 Furthermore, it is shown that the system is effective on real fragments from archaeological excavation since it is robust to noise and perturbations such as break curve chipping, erosion and to 3D noise in input surfaces. [sent-44, score-1.184]
</p><p>14 Problem statement Ceramic pots of interest have been made on a wheel and are thus axially symmetric. [sent-48, score-0.389]
</p><p>15 Hence, the intersection of a plane perpendicular to the axis with the outer pot surface is a circle. [sent-50, score-0.717]
</p><p>16 The pot breaks into sherds (fragments) along curves on the outer surface. [sent-53, score-0.611]
</p><p>17 Hence, for each fragment we refer to the outer-surface curve that specifies the fragment shape as its break curve. [sent-55, score-1.049]
</p><p>18 Typically, a pot at an archaeological excavation site is broken into anywhere from a few fragments to 100-200 fragments. [sent-56, score-0.954]
</p><p>19 The goal is to work with a pile of sherds and reconstruct the one or more pots that gave rise to these sherds. [sent-58, score-0.542]
</p><p>20 The sherds present for any one pot may not be complete. [sent-59, score-0.485]
</p><p>21 We use only x,y,z measure-  Figure 2: System overview ments of the fragment outer surface and the fragment break curve, where the break curve estimates are computed from the outer surface measurements. [sent-61, score-1.672]
</p><p>22 The break curve measurements are noisy for two reasons. [sent-64, score-0.528]
</p><p>23 First, two fragments may not have broken in a way where the break surface is perpendicular to the pot outer surface. [sent-65, score-1.274]
</p><p>24 Thus, the break curve location is not well defined. [sent-66, score-0.475]
</p><p>25 Second, if great care is not exercised in estimating a break curve from the laser-measured surface points, the break curve estimate will be highly variable, and this is the case with the data used in this paper. [sent-67, score-1.044]
</p><p>26 The reason we do not use surface albedo or surface thickness information is because our interest is seeing what can be done by measurements of just surface and break curve geometries. [sent-68, score-0.704]
</p><p>27 The other information of course could be very useful, and can be used in a more complete treatment of pot sherds reassembly. [sent-69, score-0.485]
</p><p>28 Useable reassembly of  fragments for a pot does not require reassembling all of the original pieces from the broken pot. [sent-70, score-1.078]
</p><p>29 System overview First, the system estimates the axis of symmetry for each fragment using circle templates [9], i. [sent-75, score-0.831]
</p><p>30 , cutting the fragments with planes normal to this axis the intersections are circles (Section 2). [sent-77, score-0.74]
</p><p>31 The fragments are classified as to whether the fragment data contains enough and distinctive information for estimating the axis of symmetry (Section 3). [sent-78, score-1.201]
</p><p>32 If fragments’ estimated axes are reliable, fragment reassembly is based on their symmetry property and break curve, otherwise is based solely on break curves. [sent-79, score-1.242]
</p><p>33 Second, for fragments with reliable axis estimation, the system refines their axis by matching fragments in pairs and re-estimating the common axis for each pair. [sent-81, score-1.756]
</p><p>34 Finally, for the fragments whose axis estimation is unreliable, the system uses a crude feature matching method based on only break curve features. [sent-84, score-1.285]
</p><p>35 The system represents a small patch of break curve with a weighted histogram of curvature orientations. [sent-85, score-0.561]
</p><p>36 The break curve matching results are verified with previously obtained axis information (Section 5). [sent-86, score-0.804]
</p><p>37 In order to optimally align 3D break curves from noisy and possibly incomplete 3D measurement data of ancient artifacts outer surface, strong cues are taken into consideration. [sent-90, score-0.54]
</p><p>38 This paper tackles the problem with a symmetry property, by first estimating an axis of symmetry. [sent-91, score-0.474]
</p><p>39 Previous solutions can be roughly classified into two categories, either exploiting surface normal vectors which point toward the axis [13] or making use of circle templates [9, 5]. [sent-94, score-0.427]
</p><p>40 Based on experiments, Mara and Sablatnig [9] proposed a circle template method claiming that the normal vectors are sensitive to noise and fragment shapes. [sent-96, score-0.391]
</p><p>41 It is assumed that surface points intersecting a thick plane perpendicular to the true axis should be in circular shape. [sent-97, score-0.407]
</p><p>42 Willis’ algorithm provide accurate axis estimation, in spite of perturbations, when the broken pieces are large enough, otherwise it fails, while Mara’s approach can also handle relatively small pieces at lower accuracy. [sent-99, score-0.695]
</p><p>43 The 3D line must be the fragment axis of symmetry by definition of SOR. [sent-107, score-0.736]
</p><p>44 The first term in equation (1) represents the symmetry cost of axis D. [sent-124, score-0.481]
</p><p>45 The optimal direction estimation, D∗ of the axis of symmetry is  D∗ = {φ∗,θ∗} = argθ,mφinEa(φ,θ|P). [sent-131, score-0.449]
</p><p>46 Fragment types This paper propose a reasonable way for estimating axis of symmetry by minimizing the cost function Ea (D|P). [sent-134, score-0.506]
</p><p>47 To avoid this risk, the system classifies the fragments as four types and adopts an approach based on the type. [sent-139, score-0.454]
</p><p>48 The fragment classification criteria are: sufficiency and distinctiveness for axis estimation. [sent-140, score-0.67]
</p><p>49 If the axis estimation is reliable, the cost value increases fast as the axis direction is slightly changed and vice versa. [sent-145, score-0.619]
</p><p>50 Matching based on axis estimation In this section, a reconstruction approach for fragments carrying a distinctive symmetry property is described. [sent-171, score-0.938]
</p><p>51 First, the system defines a cost function for matching two fragments which represent how well the axis/profile curve (APC) and the break curve matched. [sent-175, score-1.16]
</p><p>52 Relative position between two fragments is estimated by minimizing the cost function. [sent-176, score-0.47]
</p><p>53 to 1 DOF (relative position of 2 pieces along the axis of symmetry). [sent-182, score-0.438]
</p><p>54 The symmetry constraint not only strongly improves pairwise matching cost, but also models global consistency between fragments not necessarily adjacent to each other, as far as they share an APC. [sent-185, score-0.631]
</p><p>55 The system can afford to use this extremely useful axis of symmetry property because its estimation is accurate enough. [sent-186, score-0.539]
</p><p>56 The energy cost includes symmetry property and break curve information of the fragments. [sent-190, score-0.698]
</p><p>57 If two fragments are correctly aligned, the pair should satisfy two constraints: constant angle sum and APC alignment: Constant angle sum (C1): this conception is introduced by [4] for solving 2D jigsaw puzzles by shape. [sent-191, score-0.585]
</p><p>58 Profile curve alignment (C2): a solid of revolution can be virtually reconstructed from its APC, which naturally constrain the position of pot sherds (see Figure 4). [sent-195, score-0.69]
</p><p>59 This additional constraint greatly improves matching performance by reducing search from 6 DOF to 1(relative translation of two fragments along an axis). [sent-196, score-0.462]
</p><p>60 ρi (k) is the distance between axis of symmetry and profile curve along the k-th layer in i-th fragments, as illustrated in Figure 4. [sent-205, score-0.651]
</p><p>61 The Em cost function has 5 DOF, 4 for Di, Dj and 1 for relative position between fragments along the shared axis. [sent-231, score-0.445]
</p><p>62 Em search space is reduced to 1 DOF by initializing the axis of symmetry as described in Section 2. [sent-232, score-0.449]
</p><p>63 The system re-estimates the axis of symmetry of both fragments by minimizing Em to match two fragments robustly with a particle filter. [sent-233, score-1.316]
</p><p>64 One of the strong points of axis of symmetry property is that although the fragments are not adjacent, they interact with each other. [sent-244, score-0.884]
</p><p>65 The vector X is constrai(nζe|dc so that relative positions of all fragments satisfy geometrical consistence such as a non-overlap between fragments and non-duplication of the shards. [sent-267, score-0.826]
</p><p>66 Break Curve Matching Certain fragments lack distinctive symmetry property since they are relatively small, planar or spherical. [sent-271, score-0.631]
</p><p>67 A reasonable alternative cue for matching fragments is found at salient features on their break curves. [sent-273, score-0.787]
</p><p>68 To solve this problem, a robust matching approach based mainly on break curves is designed to involve feature points. [sent-275, score-0.42]
</p><p>69 Detected corners identify reasonable break curve endpoints which are clustered and help to pinpoint the candidates segments for matching. [sent-282, score-0.52]
</p><p>70 Break Curve Smoothing Next section describes how to construct a multiscale Horoscope along break curve points. [sent-285, score-0.475]
</p><p>71 Pˆis+1 and Pˆis−1 are intersections between the break curve and a sphere oif− r1adius Rs > Rg centered at Pi. [sent-313, score-0.475]
</p><p>72 Clustering and Matching This section describes sherd matching and alignment based on break curve feature. [sent-337, score-0.654]
</p><p>73 In general, break curves corners are piece-wise constant sequences of the distinctive 4 clusters. [sent-343, score-0.42]
</p><p>74 In order to reduce matching complexity, candidate fragments are selected based on the h-corners. [sent-345, score-0.488]
</p><p>75 This whole process is very fast and reduces the complexity of break curve match-  ing drastically by selecting corner candidates and their associated appropriate arcs for ICP alignment. [sent-353, score-0.566]
</p><p>76 Then, each 3D data set is randomly broken into N fragments (data1). [sent-364, score-0.512]
</p><p>77 Second, to generate data from a real pot, a real pot is broken into 13 pieces and the outer surface of 10 fragments are densely scanned (data2). [sent-365, score-1.096]
</p><p>78 Third, 38 fragments are obtained from the archaeological site Tell es-Safi without any prior knowledge of the fragments. [sent-366, score-0.542]
</p><p>79 The reason why the system is reliable is the reasonably high accuracy of fragment axis of symmetry estimation. [sent-369, score-0.777]
</p><p>80 Figure 6 shows the axis estimation accuracy based on the fragments from 4 synthetic pots (data1). [sent-372, score-0.994]
</p><p>81 If the direction of axis estimation for a fragment is within 5 degrees of the ground truth, the algorithm scored as having made a successful estimate. [sent-373, score-0.594]
</p><p>82 As the number of fragments for a pot increases, the fragment size decreases and the axis estimation accuracy decreases. [sent-374, score-1.262]
</p><p>83 The overall system is tested with data1 and its ground truth by increasing the number of broken fragments from a single pot (see table 1). [sent-376, score-0.808]
</p><p>84 As the number of fragments increases, each piece becomes smaller and hence the number of correct configurations estimated decreases. [sent-377, score-0.47]
</p><p>85 One of the most notable benefits of the system is the capability of simultaneously configuring a priori unknown number of pots from fragments which are mixed together in an unorganized pile. [sent-378, score-0.783]
</p><p>86 In addition, the system is designed to configure pots using only noisy outer surface measurement of real fragments. [sent-380, score-0.524]
</p><p>87 # a pot101/010171/717222/323253/030  Table 1: Number of correct configurations as the number of fragments from a pot increases(data1). [sent-384, score-0.7]
</p><p>88 24 pieces are configured based on axis of symmetry, and 7 with break curve matching. [sent-392, score-0.937]
</p><p>89 The three pots consist of 10, 16, 5 pieces respectively (see table 2). [sent-394, score-0.432]
</p><p>90 Figure 8a shows pairwise matching results based on axis of symmetry, while Figure 8b displays break curve matches. [sent-395, score-0.804]
</p><p>91 Conclusion Axially symmetric pots are automatically configured from their fragments by using two strong cues, surface symmetry about an axis and break curve information. [sent-400, score-1.741]
</p><p>92 These fragment types include not only those with significant surface curvature but also those which are almost flat, and include those which are chipped and are represented by very noisy data. [sent-402, score-0.432]
</p><p>93 It makes optimal use of geometric constraints to reduce fragment alignment complexity and introduces new insights to reduce the number offragment candidate matches based on a new measure of break curve geometry. [sent-404, score-0.817]
</p><p>94 The estimation of multiple pots given a pile of all the fragments and the reasoning provided about their joint and pairwise geometries proved to be a powerful tool to deal with this puzzle problem. [sent-405, score-0.854]
</p><p>95 Experiments show that the system is robust to noise, bumps and erosion and estimates all pots axis/profile curves for which there is extractable information in the set of fragments. [sent-406, score-0.428]

<p>Author: Dan Levi, Shai Silberstein, Aharon Bar-Hillel</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present a new part-based object detection algorithm with hundreds of parts performing realtime detection. Part-based models are currently state-ofthe-art for object detection due to their ability to represent large appearance variations. However, due to their high computational demands such methods are limited to several parts only and are too slow for practical real-time implementation. Our algorithm is an accelerated version of the “Feature Synthesis ” (FS) method [1], which uses multiple object parts for detection and is among state-of-theart methods on human detection benchmarks, but also suffers from a high computational cost. The proposed Accelerated Feature Synthesis (AFS) uses several strategies for reducing the number of locations searched for each part. The first strategy uses a novel algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search which we developed, termed “KDFerns ”, to compare each image location to only a subset of the model parts. Candidate part locations for a specific part are further reduced using spatial inhibition, and using an object-level “coarse-to-fine ” strategy. In our empirical evaluation on pedestrian detection benchmarks, AFS main- × tains almost fully the accuracy performance of the original FS, while running more than 4 faster than existing partbased methods which use only several parts. AFS is to our best knowledge the first part-based object detection method achieving real-time running performance: nearly 10 frames per-second on 640 480 images on a regular CPU.</p><p>3 0.183634 <a title="52-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Genetic_Algorithm-Based_Solver_for_Very_Large_Jigsaw_Puzzles.html">11 cvpr-2013-A Genetic Algorithm-Based Solver for Very Large Jigsaw Puzzles</a></p>

<p>Author: Ramakrishna Kakarala, Prabhu Kaliamoorthi, Vittal Premachandran</p><p>Abstract: We show that bilateral symmetry plane estimation for three-dimensional (3-D) shapes may be carried out accurately, and efficiently, in the spherical harmonic domain. Our methods are valuable for applications where spherical harmonic expansion is already employed, such as 3-D shape registration, morphometry, and retrieval. We show that the presence of bilateral symmetry in the 3-D shape is equivalent to a linear phase structure in the corresponding spherical harmonic coefficients, and provide algorithms for estimating the orientation of the symmetry plane. The benefit of using spherical harmonic phase is that symmetry estimation reduces to matching a compact set of descriptors, without the need to solve a correspondence problem. Our methods work on point clouds as well as large-scale mesh models of 3-D shapes.</p><p>5 0.094404973 <a title="52-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-scale_Curve_Detection_on_Surfaces.html">298 cvpr-2013-Multi-scale Curve Detection on Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Kolomenkin, Ilan Shimshoni, Ayellet Tal</p><p>Abstract: This paper extends to surfaces the multi-scale approach of edge detection on images. The common practice for detecting curves on surfaces requires the user to first select the scale of the features, apply an appropriate smoothing, and detect the edges on the smoothed surface. This approach suffers from two drawbacks. First, it relies on a hidden assumption that all the features on the surface are of the same scale. Second, manual user intervention is required. In this paper, we propose a general framework for automatically detecting the optimal scale for each point on the surface. We smooth the surface at each point according to this optimal scale and run the curve detection algorithm on the resulting surface. Our multi-scale algorithm solves the two disadvantages of the single-scale approach mentioned above. We demonstrate how to realize our approach on two commonly-used special cases: ridges & valleys and relief edges. In each case, the optimal scale is found in accordance with the mathematical definition of the curve.</p><p>6 0.074542686 <a title="52-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_and_Restricted_Motion_Subspaces_and_Their_Signatures.html">46 cvpr-2013-Articulated and Restricted Motion Subspaces and Their Signatures</a></p>

<p>Author: Kilho Son, Eduardo B. Almeida, David B. Cooper</p><p>Abstract: Thispaper introduces a novel approachfor reassembling pot sherds found at archaeological excavation sites, for the purpose ofreconstructing claypots that had been made on a wheel. These pots and the sherds into which they have broken are axially symmetric. The reassembly process can be viewed as 3D puzzle solving or generalized cylinder learning from broken fragments. The estimation exploits both local and semi-global geometric structure, thus making it a fundamental problem of geometry estimation from noisy fragments in computer vision and pattern recognition. The data used are densely digitized 3D laser scans of each fragment’s outer surface. The proposed reassembly system is automatic and functions when the pile of available fragments is from one or multiple pots, and even when pieces are missing from any pot. The geometric structure used are curves on the pot along which the surface had broken and the silhouette of a pot with respect to an axis, called axisprofile curve (APC). For reassembling multiple pots with or without missing pieces, our algorithm estimates the APC from each fragment, then reassembles into configurations the ones having distinctive APC. Further growth of configurations is based on adding remaining fragments such that their APC and break curves are consistent with those of a configuration. The method is novel, more robust and handles the largest numbers of fragments to date.</p><p>2 0.78719908 <a title="52-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Three-Dimensional_Bilateral_Symmetry_Plane_Estimation_in_the_Phase_Domain.html">432 cvpr-2013-Three-Dimensional Bilateral Symmetry Plane Estimation in the Phase Domain</a></p>

<p>Author: Miaomiao Liu, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of reconstructing the shape of a smooth mirror surface from a single image. In particular, we consider the case where the camera is observing the reflection of a static reference target in the unknown mirror. We first study the reconstruction problem given dense correspondences between 3D points on the reference target and image locations. In such conditions, our differential geometry analysis provides a theoretical proof that the shape of the mirror surface can be uniquely recovered if the pose of the reference target is known. We then relax our assumptions by considering the case where only sparse correspondences are available. In this scenario, we formulate reconstruction as an optimization problem, which can be solved using a nonlinear least-squares method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real images.</p><p>5 0.66119444 <a title="52-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Genetic_Algorithm-Based_Solver_for_Very_Large_Jigsaw_Puzzles.html">11 cvpr-2013-A Genetic Algorithm-Based Solver for Very Large Jigsaw Puzzles</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan Balzer, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method to efficiently generate a model (map) of small-scale objects from video. The map encodes sparse geometry as well as coarse photometry, and could be used to initialize dense reconstruction schemes as well as to support recognition and localization of three-dimensional objects. Self-occlusions and the predominance of outliers present a challenge to existing online Structure From Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping systems. We propose a unified inference criterion that encompasses map building and localization (object detection) relative to the map in a coupled fashion. We establish correspondence in a computationally efficient way without resorting to combinatorial matching or random-sampling techniques. Instead, we use a simpler M-estimator that exploits putative correspondence from tracking after photometric and topological validation. We have collected a new dataset to benchmark model building in the small scale, which we test our algorithm on in comparison to others. Although our system is significantly leaner than previous ones, it compares favorably to the state of the art in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p><p>4 0.68866968 <a title="52-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Nonlinearly_Constrained_MRFs%3A_Exploring_the_Intrinsic_Dimensions_of_Higher-Order_Cliques.html">308 cvpr-2013-Nonlinearly Constrained MRFs: Exploring the Intrinsic Dimensions of Higher-Order Cliques</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Stefano Soatto, Shing-Tung Yau</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient approach to integrating non-local statistics into the higher-order Markov Random Fields (MRFs) framework. Motivated by the observation that many non-local statistics (e.g., shape priors, color distributions) can usually be represented by a small number of parameters, we reformulate the higher-order MRF model by introducing additional latent variables to represent the intrinsic dimensions of the higher-order cliques. The resulting new model, called NC-MRF, not only provides the flexibility in representing the configurations of higher-order cliques, but also automatically decomposes the energy function into less coupled terms, allowing us to design an efficient algorithmic framework for maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Based on this novel modeling/inference framework, we achieve state-of-the-art solutions to the challenging problems of class-specific image segmentation and template-based 3D facial expression tracking, which demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>5 0.6442458 <a title="52-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-An_Approach_to_Pose-Based_Action_Recognition.html">40 cvpr-2013-An Approach to Pose-Based Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunyu Wang, Yizhou Wang, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We address action recognition in videos by modeling the spatial-temporal structures of human poses. We start by improving a state of the art method for estimating human joint locations from videos. More precisely, we obtain the K-best estimations output by the existing method and incorporate additional segmentation cues and temporal constraints to select the “best” one. Then we group the estimated joints into five body parts (e.g. the left arm) and apply data mining techniques to obtain a representation for the spatial-temporal structures of human actions. This representation captures the spatial configurations ofbodyparts in one frame (by spatial-part-sets) as well as the body part movements(by temporal-part-sets) which are characteristic of human actions. It is interpretable, compact, and also robust to errors on joint estimations. Experimental results first show that our approach is able to localize body joints more accurately than existing methods. Next we show that it outperforms state of the art action recognizers on the UCF sport, the Keck Gesture and the MSR-Action3D datasets.</p><p>6 0.63328212 <a title="52-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Active_Contours_with_Group_Similarity.html">33 cvpr-2013-Active Contours with Group Similarity</a></p>

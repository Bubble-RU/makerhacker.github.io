<p>Author: Zheng Ma, Antoni B. Chan</p><p>Abstract: We propose an integer programming method for estimating the instantaneous count of pedestrians crossing a line of interest in a video sequence. Through a line sampling process, the video is first converted into a temporal slice image. Next, the number of people is estimated in a set of overlapping sliding windows on the temporal slice image, using a regression function that maps from local features to a count. Given that count in a sliding window is the sum of the instantaneous counts in the corresponding time interval, an integer programming method is proposed to recover the number of pedestrians crossing the line of interest in each frame. Integrating over a specific time interval yields the cumulative count of pedestrian crossing the line. Compared with current methods for line counting, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging crowd video datasets.</p><p>3 0.47272077 <a title="299-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Measuring_Crowd_Collectiveness.html">282 cvpr-2013-Measuring Crowd Collectiveness</a></p>
<p>Author: Bolei Zhou, Xiaoou Tang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Collective motions are common in crowd systems and have attracted a great deal of attention in a variety of multidisciplinary fields. Collectiveness, which indicates the degree of individuals acting as a union in collective motion, is a fundamental and universal measurement for various crowd systems. By integrating path similarities among crowds on collective manifold, this paper proposes a descriptor of collectiveness and an efficient computation for the crowd and its constituent individuals. The algorithm of the Collective Merging is then proposed to detect collective motions from random motions. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed collectiveness descriptor on the system of self-driven particles. We then compare the collectiveness descriptor to human perception for collective motion and show high consistency. Our experiments regarding the detection of collective motions and the measurement of collectiveness in videos of pedestrian crowds and bacteria colony demonstrate a wide range of applications of the collectiveness descriptor1.</p><p>4 0.3377324 <a title="299-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Cumulative_Attribute_Space_for_Age_and_Crowd_Density_Estimation.html">101 cvpr-2013-Cumulative Attribute Space for Age and Crowd Density Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Chen, Shaogang Gong, Tao Xiang, Chen Change Loy</p><p>Abstract: A number of computer vision problems such as human age estimation, crowd density estimation and body/face pose (view angle) estimation can be formulated as a regression problem by learning a mapping function between a high dimensional vector-formed feature input and a scalarvalued output. Such a learning problem is made difficult due to sparse and imbalanced training data and large feature variations caused by both uncertain viewing conditions and intrinsic ambiguities between observable visual features and the scalar values to be estimated. Encouraged by the recent success in using attributes for solving classification problems with sparse training data, this paper introduces a novel cumulative attribute concept for learning a regression model when only sparse and imbalanced data are available. More precisely, low-level visual features extracted from sparse and imbalanced image samples are mapped onto a cumulative attribute space where each dimension has clearly defined semantic interpretation (a label) that captures how the scalar output value (e.g. age, people count) changes continuously and cumulatively. Extensive experiments show that our cumulative attribute framework gains notable advantage on accuracy for both age estimation and crowd counting when compared against conventional regression models, especially when the labelled training data is sparse with imbalanced sampling.</p><p>5 0.26017845 <a title="299-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_to_Detect_Partially_Overlapping_Instances.html">264 cvpr-2013-Learning to Detect Partially Overlapping Instances</a></p>
<p>Author: Carlos Arteta, Victor Lempitsky, J. Alison Noble, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: The objective of this work is to detect all instances of a class (such as cells or people) in an image. The instances may be partially overlapping and clustered, and hence quite challenging for traditional detectors, which aim at localizing individual instances. Our approach is to propose a set of candidate regions, and then select regions based on optimizing a global classification score, subject to the constraint that the selected regions are non-overlapping. Our novel contribution is to extend standard object detection by introducing separate classes for tuples of objects into the detection process. For example, our detector can pick a region containing two or three object instances, while assigning such region an appropriate label. We show that this formulation can be learned within the structured output SVM framework, and that the inference in such model can be accomplished using dynamic programming on a tree structured region graph. Furthermore, the learning only requires weak annotations – a dot on each instance. The improvement resulting from the addition of the capability to detect tuples of objects is demonstrated on quite disparate data sets: fluorescence microscopy images and UCSD pedestrians.</p><p>6 0.20632799 <a title="299-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Representing_Videos_Using_Mid-level_Discriminative_Patches.html">355 cvpr-2013-Representing Videos Using Mid-level Discriminative Patches</a></p>

<p>Author: Alessandro Perina, Nebojsa Jojic</p><p>Abstract: Recently, the Counting Grid (CG) model [5] was developed to represent each input image as a point in a large grid of feature counts. This latent point is a corner of a window of grid points which are all uniformly combined to match the (normalized) feature counts in the image. Being a bag of word model with spatial layout in the latent space, the CG model has superior handling of field of view changes in comparison to other bag of word models, but with the price of being essentially a mixture, mapping each scene to a single window in the grid. In this paper we introduce a family of componential models, dubbed the Componential Counting Grid, whose members represent each input image by multiple latent locations, rather than just one. In this way, we make a substantially more flexible admixture model which captures layers or parts of images and maps them to separate windows in a Counting Grid. We tested the models on scene and place classification where their com- ponential nature helped to extract objects, to capture parallax effects, thus better fitting the data and outperforming Counting Grids and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, especially on sequences taken with wearable cameras.</p><p>5 0.54424715 <a title="299-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Cumulative_Attribute_Space_for_Age_and_Crowd_Density_Estimation.html">101 cvpr-2013-Cumulative Attribute Space for Age and Crowd Density Estimation</a></p>

Based on the refined strands, the algorithm can reconstruct an approximate hair surface: experiments with synthetic hair models achieve an accuracy of ∼3mm.

Compared to basic level recognition, fine-grained categorization can be more challenging as there are in general less data and fewer discriminative features. This necessitates the use of stronger prior for feature selection. In this work, we include humans in the loop to help computers select discriminative features. We introduce a novel online game called “Bubbles ” that reveals discriminative features humans use. The player’s goal is to identify the category of a heavily blurred image. During the game, the player can choose to reveal full details of circular regions ( “bubbles”), with a certain penalty. With proper setup the game generates discriminative bubbles with assured quality. We next propose the “BubbleBank” algorithm that uses the human selected bubbles to improve machine recognition performance. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields large improvements over the previous state of the art on challenging benchmarks.</p><p>3 0.93415684 <a title="299-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Video_Enhancement_of_People_Wearing_Polarized_Glasses%3A_Darkening_Reversal_and_Reflection_Reduction.html">454 cvpr-2013-Video Enhancement of People Wearing Polarized Glasses: Darkening Reversal and Reflection Reduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Mao Ye, Cha Zhang, Ruigang Yang</p><p>Abstract: With the wide-spread of consumer 3D-TV technology, stereoscopic videoconferencing systems are emerging. However, the special glasses participants wear to see 3D can create distracting images. This paper presents a computational framework to reduce undesirable artifacts in the eye regions caused by these 3D glasses. More specifically, we add polarized filters to the stereo camera so that partial images of reflection can be captured. A novel Bayesian model is then developed to describe the imaging process of the eye regions including darkening and reflection, and infer the eye regions based on Classification ExpectationMaximization (EM). The recovered eye regions under the glasses are brighter and with little reflections, leading to a more nature videoconferencing experience. Qualitative evaluations and user studies are conducted to demonstrate the substantial improvement our approach can achieve.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.90898228 <a title="299-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-source_Multi-scale_Counting_in_Extremely_Dense_Crowd_Images.html">299 cvpr-2013-Multi-source Multi-scale Counting in Extremely Dense Crowd Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Haroon Idrees, Imran Saleemi, Cody Seibert, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: We propose to leverage multiple sources of information to compute an estimate of the number of individuals present in an extremely dense crowd visible in a single image. Due to problems including perspective, occlusion, clutter, and few pixels per person, counting by human detection in such images is almost impossible. Instead, our approach relies on multiple sources such as low confidence head detections, repetition of texture elements (using SIFT), and frequency-domain analysis to estimate counts, along with confidence associated with observing individuals, in an image region. Secondly, we employ a global consistency constraint on counts using Markov Random Field. This caters for disparity in counts in local neighborhoods and across scales. We tested our approach on a new dataset of fifty crowd images containing 64K annotated humans, with the head counts ranging from 94 to 4543. This is in stark con- trast to datasets usedfor existing methods which contain not more than tens of individuals. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed approach by quantifying the counting performance.</p><p>5 0.90578222 <a title="299-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Harry_Potter%27s_Marauder%27s_Map%3A_Localizing_and_Tracking_Multiple_Persons-of-Interest_by_Nonnegative_Discretization.html">199 cvpr-2013-Harry Potter's Marauder's Map: Localizing and Tracking Multiple Persons-of-Interest by Nonnegative Discretization</a></p>
<p>Author: Shoou-I Yu, Yi Yang, Alexander Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: A device just like Harry Potter’s Marauder’s Map, which pinpoints the location ofeachperson-of-interest at all times, provides invaluable information for analysis of surveillance videos. To make this device real, a system would be required to perform robust person localization and tracking in real world surveillance scenarios, especially for complex indoor environments with many walls causing occlusion and long corridors with sparse surveillance camera coverage. We propose a tracking-by-detection approach with nonnegative discretization to tackle this problem. Given a set of person detection outputs, our framework takes advantage of all important cues such as color, person detection, face recognition and non-background information to perform tracking. Local learning approaches are used to uncover the manifold structure in the appearance space with spatio-temporal constraints. Nonnegative discretization is used to enforce the mutual exclusion constraint, which guarantees a person detection output to only belong to exactly one individual. Experiments show that our algorithm performs robust lo- calization and tracking of persons-of-interest not only in outdoor scenes, but also in a complex indoor real-world nursing home environment.</p><p>6 0.90263349 <a title="299-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-3D_Visual_Proxemics%3A_Recognizing_Human_Interactions_in_3D_from_a_Single_Image.html">4 cvpr-2013-3D Visual Proxemics: Recognizing Human Interactions in 3D from a Single Image</a></p>

<p>Author: Felix X. Yu, Liangliang Cao, Rogerio S. Feris, John R. Smith, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Attribute-based representation has shown great promises for visual recognition due to its intuitive interpretation and cross-category generalization property. However, human efforts are usually involved in the attribute designing process, making the representation costly to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation to automatically design discriminative “category-level attributes ”, which can be efficiently encoded by a compact category-attribute matrix. The formulation allows us to achieve intuitive and critical design criteria (category-separability, learnability) in a principled way. The designed attributes can be used for tasks of cross-category knowledge transfer, achieving superior performance over well-known attribute dataset Animals with Attributes (AwA) and a large-scale ILSVRC2010 dataset (1.2M images).

<p>Author: Zhigang Ma, Yi Yang, Zhongwen Xu, Shuicheng Yan, Nicu Sebe, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Complex events essentially include human, scenes, objects and actions that can be summarized by visual attributes, so leveraging relevant attributes properly could be helpful for event detection. Many works have exploited attributes at image level for various applications. However, attributes at image level are possibly insufficient for complex event detection in videos due to their limited capability in characterizing the dynamic properties of video data. Hence, we propose to leverage attributes at video level (named as video attributes in this work), i.e., the semantic labels of external videos are used as attributes. Compared to complex event videos, these external videos contain simple contents such as objects, scenes and actions which are the basic elements of complex events. Specifically, building upon a correlation vector which correlates the attributes and the complex event, we incorporate video attributes latently as extra informative cues into the event detector learnt from complex event videos. Extensive experiments on a real-world large-scale dataset validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p><p>4 0.21793671 <a title="348-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-It%27s_Not_Polite_to_Point%3A_Describing_People_with_Uncertain_Attributes.html">229 cvpr-2013-It's Not Polite to Point: Describing People with Uncertain Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Sadovnik, Andrew Gallagher, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: Visual attributes are powerful features for many different applications in computer vision such as object detection and scene recognition. Visual attributes present another application that has not been examined as rigorously: verbal communication from a computer to a human. Since many attributes are nameable, the computer is able to communicate these concepts through language. However, this is not a trivial task. Given a set of attributes, selecting a subset to be communicated is task dependent. Moreover, because attribute classifiers are noisy, it is important to find ways to deal with this uncertainty. We address the issue of communication by examining the task of composing an automatic description of a person in a group photo that distinguishes him from the others. We introduce an efficient, principled methodfor choosing which attributes are included in a short description to maximize the likelihood that a third party will correctly guess to which person the description refers. We compare our algorithm to computer baselines and human describers, and show the strength of our method in creating effective descriptions.</p><p>5 0.20961083 <a title="348-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Adding_Unlabeled_Samples_to_Categories_by_Learned_Attributes.html">36 cvpr-2013-Adding Unlabeled Samples to Categories by Learned Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonghyun Choi, Mohammad Rastegari, Ali Farhadi, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to expand the visual coverage of training sets that consist of a small number of labeled examples using learned attributes. Our optimization formulation discovers category specific attributes as well as the images that have high confidence in terms of the attributes. In addition, we propose a method to stably capture example-specific attributes for a small sized training set. Our method adds images to a category from a large unlabeled image pool, and leads to significant improvement in category recognition accuracy evaluated on a large-scale dataset, ImageNet.</p><p>6 0.20161924 <a title="348-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Simultaneous_Active_Learning_of_Classifiers_%26_Attributes_via_Relative_Feedback.html">396 cvpr-2013-Simultaneous Active Learning of Classifiers & Attributes via Relative Feedback</a></p>

<p>Author: Catherine Wah, Serge Belongie</p><p>Abstract: Recent work in computer vision has addressed zero-shot learning or unseen class detection, which involves categorizing objects without observing any training examples. However, these problems assume that attributes or defining characteristics of these unobserved classes are known, leveraging this information at test time to detect an unseen class. We address the more realistic problem of detecting categories that do not appear in the dataset in any form. We denote such a category as an unfamiliar class; it is neither observed at train time, nor do we possess any knowledge regarding its relationships to attributes. This problem is one that has received limited attention within the computer vision community. In this work, we propose a novel ap. ucs d .edu Unfamiliar? or?not?

We demonstrate results superior to existing methods on the challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset.</p><p>5 0.76494282 <a title="348-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Object-Centric_Anomaly_Detection_by_Attribute-Based_Reasoning.html">310 cvpr-2013-Object-Centric Anomaly Detection by Attribute-Based Reasoning</a></p>
<p>Author: Babak Saleh, Ali Farhadi, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: When describing images, humans tend not to talk about the obvious, but rather mention what they find interesting. We argue that abnormalities and deviations from typicalities are among the most important components that form what is worth mentioning. In this paper we introduce the abnormality detection as a recognition problem and show how to model typicalities and, consequently, meaningful deviations from prototypical properties of categories. Our model can recognize abnormalities and report the main reasons of any recognized abnormality. We also show that abnormality predictions can help image categorization. We introduce the abnormality detection dataset and show interesting results on how to reason about abnormalities.</p><p>6 0.76094258 <a title="348-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-It%27s_Not_Polite_to_Point%3A_Describing_People_with_Uncertain_Attributes.html">229 cvpr-2013-It's Not Polite to Point: Describing People with Uncertain Attributes</a></p>

<p>Author: Zheng Lu, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We present a video summarization approach that discovers the story of an egocentric video. Given a long input video, our method selects a short chain of video subshots depicting the essential events. Inspired by work in text analysis that links news articles over time, we define a randomwalk based metric of influence between subshots that reflects how visual objects contribute to the progression of events. Using this influence metric, we define an objective for the optimal k-subshot summary. Whereas traditional methods optimize a summary ’s diversity or representativeness, ours explicitly accounts for how one sub-event “leads to ” another—which, critically, captures event connectivity beyond simple object co-occurrence. As a result, our summaries provide a better sense of story. We apply our approach to over 12 hours of daily activity video taken from 23 unique camera wearers, and systematically evaluate its quality compared to multiple baselines with 34 human subjects.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.79056835 <a title="348-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Recognizing_Activities_via_Bag_of_Words_for_Attribute_Dynamics.html">348 cvpr-2013-Recognizing Activities via Bag of Words for Attribute Dynamics</a></p>

An extensive experimental evaluation reveals that this representation outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in temporal structure modeling for complex ac- tivity recognition.</p><p>3 0.77903658 <a title="348-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Poselet_Key-Framing%3A_A_Model_for_Human_Activity_Recognition.html">336 cvpr-2013-Poselet Key-Framing: A Model for Human Activity Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Michalis Raptis, Leonid Sigal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new model for recognizing human actions. An action is modeled as a very sparse sequence of temporally local discriminative keyframes collections of partial key-poses of the actor(s), depicting key states in the action sequence. We cast the learning of keyframes in a max-margin discriminative framework, where we treat keyframes as latent variables. This allows us to (jointly) learn a set of most discriminative keyframes while also learning the local temporal context between them. Keyframes are encoded using a spatially-localizable poselet-like representation with HoG and BoW components learned from weak annotations; we rely on structured SVM formulation to align our components and minefor hard negatives to boost localization performance. This results in a model that supports spatio-temporal localization and is insensitive to dropped frames or partial observations. We show classification performance that is competitive with the state of the art on the benchmark UT-Interaction dataset and illustrate that our model outperforms prior methods in an on-line streaming setting.</p><p>4 0.75874627 <a title="348-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Finding_Group_Interactions_in_Social_Clutter.html">172 cvpr-2013-Finding Group Interactions in Social Clutter</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruonan Li, Parker Porfilio, Todd Zickler</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of finding distinctive social interactions involving groups of agents embedded in larger social gatherings. Given a pre-defined gallery of short exemplar interaction videos, and a long input video of a large gathering (with approximately-tracked agents), we identify within the gathering small sub-groups of agents exhibiting social interactions that resemble those in the exemplars. The participants of each detected group interaction are localized in space; the extent of their interaction is localized in time; and when the gallery ofexemplars is annotated with group-interaction categories, each detected interaction is classified into one of the pre-defined categories. Our approach represents group behaviors by dichotomous collections of descriptors for (a) individual actions, and (b) pairwise interactions; and it includes efficient algorithms for optimally distinguishing participants from by-standers in every temporal unit and for temporally localizing the extent of the group interaction. Most importantly, the method is generic and can be applied whenever numerous interacting agents can be approximately tracked over time. We evaluate the approach using three different video collections, two that involve humans and one that involves mice.</p><p>5 0.73248053 <a title="348-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Integrating_Grammar_and_Segmentation_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">225 cvpr-2013-Integrating Grammar and Segmentation for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Brandon Rothrock, Seyoung Park, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a compositional and-or graph grammar model for human pose estimation. Our model has three distinguishing features: (i) large appearance differences between people are handled compositionally by allowingparts or collections ofparts to be substituted with alternative variants, (ii) each variant is a sub-model that can define its own articulated geometry and context-sensitive compatibility with neighboring part variants, and (iii) background region segmentation is incorporated into the part appearance models to better estimate the contrast of a part region from its surroundings, and improve resilience to background clutter. The resulting integrated framework is trained discriminatively in a max-margin framework using an efficient and exact inference algorithm. We present experimental evaluation of our model on two popular datasets, and show performance improvements over the state-of-art on both benchmarks.</p><p>6 0.73187071 <a title="348-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Real-Time_No-Reference_Image_Quality_Assessment_Based_on_Filter_Learning.html">346 cvpr-2013-Real-Time No-Reference Image Quality Assessment Based on Filter Learning</a></p>

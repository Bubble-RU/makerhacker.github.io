<p>Author: Florent Couzinié-Devy, Jian Sun, Karteek Alahari, Jean Ponce</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of restoring images subjected to unknown and spatially varying blur caused by defocus or linear (say, horizontal) motion. The estimation of the global (non-uniform) image blur is cast as a multilabel energy minimization problem. The energy is the sum of unary terms corresponding to learned local blur estimators, and binary ones corresponding to blur smoothness. Its global minimum is found using Ishikawa ’s method by exploiting the natural order of discretized blur values for linear motions and defocus. Once the blur has been estimated, the image is restored using a robust (non-uniform) deblurring algorithm based on sparse regularization with global image statistics. The proposed algorithm outputs both a segmentation of the image into uniform-blur layers and an estimate of the corresponding sharp image. We present qualitative results on real images, and use synthetic data to quantitatively compare our approach to the publicly available implementation of Chakrabarti et al. [5].</p><p>3 0.31489331 <a title="68-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_3D_Reconstruction_from_Severely_Blurred_Images_Using_a_Single_Moving_Camera.html">108 cvpr-2013-Dense 3D Reconstruction from Severely Blurred Images Using a Single Moving Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Hee Seok Lee, Kuoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: Motion blur frequently occurs in dense 3D reconstruction using a single moving camera, and it degrades the quality of the 3D reconstruction. To handle motion blur caused by rapid camera shakes, we propose a blur-aware depth reconstruction method, which utilizes a pixel correspondence that is obtained by considering the effect of motion blur. Motion blur is dependent on 3D geometry, thus parameterizing blurred appearance of images with scene depth given camera motion is possible and a depth map can be accurately estimated from the blur-considered pixel correspondence. The estimated depth is then converted intopixel-wise blur kernels, and non-uniform motion blur is easily removed with low computational cost. The obtained blur kernel is depth-dependent, thus it effectively addresses scene-depth variation, which is a challenging problem in conventional non-uniform deblurring methods.</p><p>4 0.28063729 <a title="68-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Non-blind_Deblurring.html">131 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Non-blind Deblurring</a></p>
<p>Author: Uwe Schmidt, Carsten Rother, Sebastian Nowozin, Jeremy Jancsary, Stefan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Non-blind deblurring is an integral component of blind approaches for removing image blur due to camera shake. Even though learning-based deblurring methods exist, they have been limited to the generative case and are computationally expensive. To this date, manually-defined models are thus most widely used, though limiting the attained restoration quality. We address this gap by proposing a discriminative approach for non-blind deblurring. One key challenge is that the blur kernel in use at test time is not known in advance. To address this, we analyze existing approaches that use half-quadratic regularization. From this analysis, we derive a discriminative model cascade for image deblurring. Our cascade model consists of a Gaussian CRF at each stage, based on the recently introduced regression tree fields. We train our model by loss minimization and use synthetically generated blur kernels to generate training data. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is efficient and yields state-of-the-art restoration quality on images corrupted with synthetic and real blur.</p><p>5 0.26726356 <a title="68-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-uniform_Motion_Deblurring_for_Bilayer_Scenes.html">307 cvpr-2013-Non-uniform Motion Deblurring for Bilayer Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Chandramouli Paramanand, Ambasamudram N. Rajagopalan</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the latent image of a static bilayer scene (consisting of a foreground and a background at different depths) from motion blurred observations captured with a handheld camera. The camera motion is considered to be composed of in-plane rotations and translations. Since the blur at an image location depends both on camera motion and depth, deblurring becomes a difficult task. We initially propose a method to estimate the transformation spread function (TSF) corresponding to one of the depth layers. The estimated TSF (which reveals the camera motion during exposure) is used to segment the scene into the foreground and background layers and determine the relative depth value. The deblurred image of the scene is finally estimated within a regularization framework by accounting for blur variations due to camera motion as well as depth.</p><p>6 0.22591749 <a title="68-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Unnatural_L0_Sparse_Representation_for_Natural_Image_Deblurring.html">449 cvpr-2013-Unnatural L0 Sparse Representation for Natural Image Deblurring</a></p>

<p>Author: Haichao Zhang, David Wipf, Yanning Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a robust algorithm for estimating a single latent sharp image given multiple blurry and/or noisy observations. The underlying multi-image blind deconvolution problem is solved by linking all of the observations together via a Bayesian-inspired penalty function which couples the unknown latent image, blur kernels, and noise levels together in a unique way. This coupled penalty function enjoys a number of desirable properties, including a mechanism whereby the relative-concavity or shape is adapted as a function of the intrinsic quality of each blurry observation. In this way, higher quality observations may automatically contribute more to the final estimate than heavily degraded ones. The resulting algorithm, which requires no essential tuning parameters, can recover a high quality image from a set of observations containing potentially both blurry and noisy examples, without knowing a priorithe degradation type of each observation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world test images clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</p><p>5 0.80895591 <a title="68-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-uniform_Motion_Deblurring_for_Bilayer_Scenes.html">307 cvpr-2013-Non-uniform Motion Deblurring for Bilayer Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Shihui Ying, Guorong Wu, Qian Wang, Dinggang Shen</p><p>Abstract: Recently, groupwise registration has been investigated for simultaneous alignment of all images without selecting any individual image as the template, thus avoiding the potential bias in image registration. However, none of current groupwise registration method fully utilizes the image distribution to guide the registration. Thus, the registration performance usually suffers from large inter-subject variations across individual images. To solve this issue, we propose a novel groupwise registration algorithm for large population dataset, guided by the image distribution on the manifold. Specifically, we first use a graph to model the distribution of all image data sitting on the image manifold, with each node representing an image and each edge representing the geodesic pathway between two nodes (or images). Then, the procedure of warping all images to theirpopulation center turns to the dynamic shrinking ofthe graph nodes along their graph edges until all graph nodes become close to each other. Thus, the topology ofimage distribution on the image manifold is always preserved during the groupwise registration. More importantly, by modeling , the distribution of all images via a graph, we can potentially reduce registration error since every time each image is warped only according to its nearby images with similar structures in the graph. We have evaluated our proposed groupwise registration method on both synthetic and real datasets, with comparison to the two state-of-the-art groupwise registration methods. All experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of registration accuracy and robustness.</p><p>3 0.69884151 <a title="68-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_a_Manifold_as_an_Atlas.html">259 cvpr-2013-Learning a Manifold as an Atlas</a></p>

We formulate the problem of learning the manifold as an optimisation that simultaneously refines the continuous parameters defining the charts, and the discrete assignment of points to charts. In contrast to existing methods, this direct formulation of a manifold does not require “unwrapping ” the manifold into a lower dimensional space and allows us to learn closed manifolds of interest to vision, such as those corresponding to gait cycles or camera pose. We report state-ofthe-art results for manifold based nearest neighbour classification on vision datasets, and show how the same techniques can be applied to the 3D reconstruction of human motion from a single image.</p><p>4 0.68924129 <a title="68-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploiting_the_Power_of_Stereo_Confidences.html">155 cvpr-2013-Exploiting the Power of Stereo Confidences</a></p>
<p>Author: David Pfeiffer, Stefan Gehrig, Nicolai Schneider</p><p>Abstract: Applications based on stereo vision are becoming increasingly common, ranging from gaming over robotics to driver assistance. While stereo algorithms have been investigated heavily both on the pixel and the application level, far less attention has been dedicated to the use of stereo confidence cues. Mostly, a threshold is applied to the confidence values for further processing, which is essentially a sparsified disparity map. This is straightforward but it does not take full advantage of the available information. In this paper, we make full use of the stereo confidence cues by propagating all confidence values along with the measured disparities in a Bayesian manner. Before using this information, a mapping from confidence values to disparity outlier probability rate is performed based on gathered disparity statistics from labeled video data. We present an extension of the so called Stixel World, a generic 3D intermediate representation that can serve as input for many of the applications mentioned above. This scheme is modified to directly exploit stereo confidence cues in the underlying sensor model during a maximum a poste- riori estimation process. The effectiveness of this step is verified in an in-depth evaluation on a large real-world traffic data base of which parts are made publicly available. We show that using stereo confidence cues allows both reducing the number of false object detections by a factor of six while keeping the detection rate at a near constant level.</p><p>5 0.65513432 <a title="68-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Lagrangian_Relaxation_to_Min-cost_Network_Flow.html">300 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Asad A. Butt, Robert T. Collins</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for global multi-target tracking that can incorporate higher-order track smoothness constraints such as constant velocity. Our problem formulation readily lends itself to path estimation in a trellis graph, but unlike previous methods, each node in our network represents a candidate pair of matching observations between consecutive frames. Extra constraints on binary flow variables in the graph result in a problem that can no longer be solved by min-cost network flow. We therefore propose an iterative solution method that relaxes these extra constraints using Lagrangian relaxation, resulting in a series of problems that ARE solvable by min-cost flow, and that progressively improve towards a high-quality solution to our original optimization problem. We present experimental results showing that our method outperforms the standard network-flow formulation as well as other recent algorithms that attempt to incorporate higher-order smoothness constraints.</p><p>6 0.65197849 <a title="68-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Measuring_Crowd_Collectiveness.html">282 cvpr-2013-Measuring Crowd Collectiveness</a></p>

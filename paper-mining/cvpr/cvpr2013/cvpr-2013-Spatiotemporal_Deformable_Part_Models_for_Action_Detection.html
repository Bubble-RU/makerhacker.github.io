<p>Author: Feng Shi, Emil Petriu, Robert Lagani√®re</p><p>Abstract: Local spatio-temporal features and bag-of-features representations have become popular for action recognition. A recent trend is to use dense sampling for better performance. While many methods claimed to use dense feature sets, most of them are just denser than approaches based on sparse interest point detectors. In this paper, we explore sampling with high density on action recognition. We also investigate the impact of random sampling over dense grid for computational efficiency. We present a real-time action recognition system which integrates fast random sampling method with local spatio-temporal features extracted from a Local Part Model. A new method based on histogram intersection kernel is proposed to combine multiple channels of different descriptors. Our technique shows high accuracy on the simple KTH dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art on two very challenging real-world datasets, namely, 93% on KTH, 83.3% on UCF50 and 47.6% on HMDB51.</p><p>3 0.12932028 <a title="408-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Representing_Videos_Using_Mid-level_Discriminative_Patches.html">355 cvpr-2013-Representing Videos Using Mid-level Discriminative Patches</a></p>
<p>Author: Arpit Jain, Abhinav Gupta, Mikel Rodriguez, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: How should a video be represented? We propose a new representation for videos based on mid-level discriminative spatio-temporal patches. These spatio-temporal patches might correspond to a primitive human action, a semantic object, or perhaps a random but informative spatiotemporal patch in the video. What defines these spatiotemporal patches is their discriminative and representative properties. We automatically mine these patches from hundreds of training videos and experimentally demonstrate that these patches establish correspondence across videos and align the videos for label transfer techniques. Furthermore, these patches can be used as a discriminative vocabulary for action classification where they demonstrate stateof-the-art performance on UCF50 and Olympics datasets.</p><p>4 0.12469281 <a title="408-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-HON4D%3A_Histogram_of_Oriented_4D_Normals_for_Activity_Recognition_from_Depth_Sequences.html">196 cvpr-2013-HON4D: Histogram of Oriented 4D Normals for Activity Recognition from Depth Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Omar Oreifej, Zicheng Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a new descriptor for activity recognition from videos acquired by a depth sensor. Previous descriptors mostly compute shape and motion features independently; thus, they often fail to capture the complex joint shapemotion cues at pixel-level. In contrast, we describe the depth sequence using a histogram capturing the distribution of the surface normal orientation in the 4D space of time, depth, and spatial coordinates. To build the histogram, we create 4D projectors, which quantize the 4D space and represent the possible directions for the 4D normal. We initialize the projectors using the vertices of a regular polychoron. Consequently, we refine the projectors using a discriminative density measure, such that additional projectors are induced in the directions where the 4D normals are more dense and discriminative. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our descriptor better captures the joint shape-motion cues in the depth sequence, and thus outperforms the state-of-the-art on all relevant benchmarks.</p><p>5 0.11986324 <a title="408-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-task_Sparse_Learning_with_Beta_Process_Prior_for_Action_Recognition.html">302 cvpr-2013-Multi-task Sparse Learning with Beta Process Prior for Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunfeng Yuan, Weiming Hu, Guodong Tian, Shuang Yang, Haoran Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we formulate human action recognition as a novel Multi-Task Sparse Learning(MTSL) framework which aims to construct a test sample with multiple features from as few bases as possible. Learning the sparse representation under each feature modality is considered as a single task in MTSL. Since the tasks are generated from multiple features associated with the same visual input, they are not independent but inter-related. We introduce a Beta process(BP) prior to the hierarchical MTSL model, which efficiently learns a compact dictionary and infers the sparse structure shared across all the tasks. The MTSL model enforces the robustness in coefficient estimation compared with performing each task independently. Besides, the sparseness is achieved via the Beta process formulation rather than the computationally expensive l1 norm penalty. In terms of non-informative gamma hyper-priors, the sparsity level is totally decided by the data. Finally, the learning problem is solved by Gibbs sampling inference which estimates the full posterior on the model parameters. Experimental results on the KTH and UCF sports datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MTSL approach for action recognition.</p><p>6 0.11960851 <a title="408-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Bottom-Up_Segmentation_for_Top-Down_Detection.html">70 cvpr-2013-Bottom-Up Segmentation for Top-Down Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: LiMin Wang, Yu Qiao, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes motionlet, a mid-level and spatiotemporal part, for human motion recognition. Motionlet can be seen as a tight cluster in motion and appearance space, corresponding to the moving process of different body parts. We postulate three key properties of motionlet for action recognition: high motion saliency, multiple scale representation, and representative-discriminative ability. Towards this goal, we develop a data-driven approach to learn motionlets from training videos. First, we extract 3D regions with high motion saliency. Then we cluster these regions and preserve the centers as candidate templates for motionlet. Finally, we examine the representative and discriminative power of the candidates, and introduce a greedy method to select effective candidates. With motionlets, we present a mid-level representation for video, called motionlet activation vector. We conduct experiments on three datasets, KTH, HMDB51, and UCF50. The results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>3 0.79935795 <a title="408-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Modeling_Actions_through_State_Changes.html">287 cvpr-2013-Modeling Actions through State Changes</a></p>
<p>Author: Alireza Fathi, James M. Rehg</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a model of action based on the change in the state of the environment. Many actions involve similar dynamics and hand-object relationships, but differ in their purpose and meaning. The key to differentiating these actions is the ability to identify how they change the state of objects and materials in the environment. We propose a weakly supervised method for learning the object and material states that are necessary for recognizing daily actions. Once these state detectors are learned, we can apply them to input videos and pool their outputs to detect actions. We further demonstrate that our method can be used to segment discrete actions from a continuous video of an activity. Our results outperform state-of-the-art action recognition and activity segmentation results.</p><p>4 0.7626617 <a title="408-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Recognize_Human_Activities_from_Partially_Observed_Videos.html">347 cvpr-2013-Recognize Human Activities from Partially Observed Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Cao, Daniel Barrett, Andrei Barbu, Siddharth Narayanaswamy, Haonan Yu, Aaron Michaux, Yuewei Lin, Sven Dickinson, Jeffrey Mark Siskind, Song Wang</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing human activities in partially observed videos is a challengingproblem and has many practical applications. When the unobserved subsequence is at the end of the video, the problem is reduced to activity prediction from unfinished activity streaming, which has been studied by many researchers. However, in the general case, an unobserved subsequence may occur at any time by yielding a temporal gap in the video. In this paper, we propose a new method that can recognize human activities from partially observed videos in the general case. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a probabilistic framework: 1) dividing each activity into multiple ordered temporal segments, 2) using spatiotemporal features of the training video samples in each segment as bases and applying sparse coding (SC) to derive the activity likelihood of the test video sample at each segment, and 3) finally combining the likelihood at each segment to achieve a global posterior for the activities. We further extend the proposed method to include more bases that correspond to a mixture of segments with different temporal lengths (MSSC), which can better rep- resent the activities with large intra-class variations. We evaluate the proposed methods (SC and MSSC) on various real videos. We also evaluate the proposed methods on two special cases: 1) activity prediction where the unobserved subsequence is at the end of the video, and 2) human activity recognition on fully observed videos. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform existing state-of-the-art comparison methods.</p><p>5 0.76243192 <a title="408-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-3D_R_Transform_on_Spatio-temporal_Interest_Points_for_Action_Recognition.html">3 cvpr-2013-3D R Transform on Spatio-temporal Interest Points for Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunfeng Yuan, Xi Li, Weiming Hu, Haibin Ling, Stephen Maybank</p><p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal interest points serve as an elementary building block in many modern action recognition algorithms, and most of them exploit the local spatio-temporal volume features using a Bag of Visual Words (BOVW) representation. Such representation, however, ignorespotentially valuable information about the global spatio-temporal distribution of interest points. In this paper, we propose a new global feature to capture the detailed geometrical distribution of interest points. It is calculated by using the ‚Ñõ transform which is defined as an extended 3D discrete R‚Ñõa tdroann transform, followed by applying a tewdo 3-dDir decitsicorneatel two-dimensional principal component analysis. Such ‚Ñõ feature captures the geometrical information of the Sinuctehre ‚Ñõst points and keeps invariant to geometry transformation and robust to noise. In addition, we propose a new fusion strategy to combine the ‚Ñõ feature with the BOVW representation for further improving recognition accuracy.

<p>Author: Hsin-Yi Chen, Yen-Yu Lin, Bing-Yu Chen</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm that carries out alternate Hough transform and inverted Hough transform to establish feature correspondences, and enhances the quality of matching in both precision and recall. Inspired by the fact that nearby features on the same object share coherent homographies in matching, we cast the task of feature matching as a density estimation problem in the Hough space spanned by the hypotheses of homographies. Specifically, we project all the correspondences into the Hough space, and determine the correctness of the correspondences by their respective densities. In this way, mutual verification of relevant correspondences is activated, and the precision of matching is boosted. On the other hand, we infer the concerted homographies propagated from the locally grouped features, and enrich the correspondence candidates for each feature. The recall is hence increased. The two processes are tightly coupled. Through iterative optimization, plausible enrichments are gradually revealed while more correct correspondences are detected. Promising experimental results on three benchmark datasets manifest the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><p>3 0.90126717 <a title="408-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-source_Multi-scale_Counting_in_Extremely_Dense_Crowd_Images.html">299 cvpr-2013-Multi-source Multi-scale Counting in Extremely Dense Crowd Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Haroon Idrees, Imran Saleemi, Cody Seibert, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: We propose to leverage multiple sources of information to compute an estimate of the number of individuals present in an extremely dense crowd visible in a single image. Due to problems including perspective, occlusion, clutter, and few pixels per person, counting by human detection in such images is almost impossible. Instead, our approach relies on multiple sources such as low confidence head detections, repetition of texture elements (using SIFT), and frequency-domain analysis to estimate counts, along with confidence associated with observing individuals, in an image region. Secondly, we employ a global consistency constraint on counts using Markov Random Field. This caters for disparity in counts in local neighborhoods and across scales. We tested our approach on a new dataset of fifty crowd images containing 64K annotated humans, with the head counts ranging from 94 to 4543. This is in stark con- trast to datasets usedfor existing methods which contain not more than tens of individuals. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed approach by quantifying the counting performance.</p><p>4 0.90106386 <a title="408-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Analyzing_Semantic_Segmentation_Using_Hybrid_Human-Machine_CRFs.html">43 cvpr-2013-Analyzing Semantic Segmentation Using Hybrid Human-Machine CRFs</a></p>
<p>Author: Roozbeh Mottaghi, Sanja Fidler, Jian Yao, Raquel Urtasun, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Recent trends in semantic image segmentation have pushed for holistic scene understanding models that jointly reason about various tasks such as object detection, scene recognition, shape analysis, contextual reasoning. In this work, we are interested in understanding the roles of these different tasks in aiding semantic segmentation. Towards this goal, we ‚Äúplug-in ‚Äù human subjects for each of the various components in a state-of-the-art conditional random field model (CRF) on the MSRC dataset. Comparisons among various hybrid human-machine CRFs give us indications of how much ‚Äúhead room ‚Äù there is to improve segmentation by focusing research efforts on each of the tasks. One of the interesting findings from our slew of studies was that human classification of isolated super-pixels, while being worse than current machine classifiers, provides a significant boost in performance when plugged into the CRF! Fascinated by this finding, we conducted in depth analysis of the human generated potentials. This inspired a new machine potential which significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on the MRSC dataset.</p><p>5 0.90059638 <a title="408-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Improving_an_Object_Detector_and_Extracting_Regions_Using_Superpixels.html">217 cvpr-2013-Improving an Object Detector and Extracting Regions Using Superpixels</a></p>
<p>Author: Guang Shu, Afshin Dehghan, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to improve the detection performance of a generic detector when it is applied to a particular video. The performance of offline-trained objects detectors are usually degraded in unconstrained video environments due to variant illuminations, backgrounds and camera viewpoints. Moreover, most object detectors are trained using Haar-like features or gradient features but ignore video specificfeatures like consistent colorpatterns. In our approach, we apply a Superpixel-based Bag-of-Words (BoW) model to iteratively refine the output of a generic detector. Compared to other related work, our method builds a video-specific detector using superpixels, hence it can handle the problem of appearance variation. Most importantly, using Conditional Random Field (CRF) along with our super pixel-based BoW model, we develop and algorithm to segment the object from the background . Therefore our method generates an output of the exact object regions instead of the bounding boxes generated by most detectors. In general, our method takes detection bounding boxes of a generic detector as input and generates the detection output with higher average precision and precise object regions. The experiments on four recent datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and significantly improves the state-of-art detector by 5-16% in average precision.</p><p>6 0.89995468 <a title="408-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Cross-View_Action_Recognition_via_a_Continuous_Virtual_Path.html">98 cvpr-2013-Cross-View Action Recognition via a Continuous Virtual Path</a></p>

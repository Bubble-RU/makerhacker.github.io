</p><p>6 Introduction  The underlying goal of saliency detection in natural images is to identify and localize objects of interest that attract the visual attention of a human observer compared to the rest of the scene. [sent-9, score-0.534]
</p><p>7 The research area of saliency detection from natural images has gained tremendous interest in the field of computer vision given its wide applicability for many computer vision tasks such as image segmentation [9], image retargeting [3], object detection [20], and object recognition [24]. [sent-12, score-0.468]
</p><p>8 To achieve saliency detection in an automatic manner, one must define what constitutes as a salient object based on some quantifiable visual attributes such as intensity, color, structure, texture, size, or shape that makes that object apj z e lek dclaus i @uwat e rloo . [sent-13, score-0.546]
</p><p>9 In the context of saliency in natural images, one can then view salient objects of interest as objects that possess textural characteristics that are highly distinctive from a human observer perspective when compared with that of the rest of the scene. [sent-19, score-1.426]
</p><p>10 As such, we are interested in explicitly taking advantage of textural characteristics in a quantitative manner to detect saliency objects of interest within a scene. [sent-20, score-1.238]
</p><p>11 Two important challenging aspects associated with explicitly accounting for textural characteristics are: 1. [sent-21, score-0.841]
</p><p>12 the added computational complexity associated with textural characteristics compared to simpler visual attributes such as color and intensity, particularly if one were to analyze and compare all possible texture pattern pairings in the image in a direct fashion. [sent-23, score-1.053]
</p><p>13 999997777799777  Prior work that incorporated textural characteristics [25] has attempted to address these two issues by making use of lowlevel filter-based texture features and relied on image segmentation to reduce computational complexity while enforcing feature coherence within local regions. [sent-24, score-1.042]
</p><p>14 However, the reliance on advanced pre-processing algorithms such as image segmentation means that the computational complexity and performance of the saliency detection method depends heavily on the properties of the segmentation method used, even if oversegmentation is performed. [sent-25, score-0.422]
</p><p>15 Therefore, an efficient method for performing saliency detection based explicitly on descriptive textural characteristics that does not rely on additional pre-processing would be much desired. [sent-26, score-1.233]
</p><p>16 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel approach to saliency detection based on the concept of statistical textural distinctiveness. [sent-27, score-1.235]

[sent-30, score-2.012]
</p><p>20 By incorporating sparse texture modeling within a statistical textural distinctiveness framework, the proposed approach is designed to take explicit advantage of the textural characteristics in the image to detect salient regions in an efficient yet characteristic manner. [sent-31, score-2.336]
</p><p>21 To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, the use of sparse texture modeling within a statistical textural distinctiveness framework to characterize and compare textural characteristics within an image for the purpose of saliency detection has not been previously proposed or investigated.

</p><p>23 Biologically inspired techniques [13, 10] for saliency detection are commonly based on the approach of Koch et al. [sent-35, score-0.392]
</p><p>24 All these approaches are designed to identify salient regions with high visual stimuli, but tend to blur saliency maps and to highlight local features such as small objects. [sent-40, score-0.59]
</p><p>25 [8] proposed to extract the residuals  of input images in either the amplitude or phase spectrum of input images, and to use the residuals to construct saliency maps in the spatial domain. [sent-44, score-0.414]

</p><p>28 However, both image segmentation and abstraction remove textural information which might indicate salient regions in images. [sent-67, score-0.957]
</p><p>29 [25] (LR) explicitly incorporated textural characteristics obtained from lowlevel filter-based texture features of segmented regions for saliency detection. [sent-69, score-1.448]
</p><p>30 The textural characteristic of a region is represented by a feature vector, which all together build a feature matrix. [sent-70, score-0.784]
</p><p>31 However, none of these approaches explicitly consider  rotational-invariant neighborhood-based texture representations (atoms) for salient region detection. [sent-73, score-0.395]
</p><p>32 In contrast to approaches that rely on image segmentation and image abstraction where each region can only characterize a small area in the image, each learnt sparse texture atom can represent large or disjoint regions without explicit spatial context. [sent-74, score-0.441]

</p><p>35 This form of textural representation has been found to be beneficial in striking a balance between robustness to distortional variations and preservation of spatial-intensity context, making it well-suited for local textural representation in the proposed  Ã— Ã—  work (see Section 4, Fig. [sent-91, score-1.538]

</p><p>44 One simple strategy to construct such a global texture model is to simply utilize the entire set of extracted local textural representations. [sent-118, score-0.946]
</p><p>45 To address this issue, we first generalize a natural image as being composed of a set of areas where a particular texture pattern is repeated over each area, where the number of areas with unique texture patterns is much smaller than the total number of pixels within the image. [sent-120, score-0.447]
</p><p>46 Based on this gen-  Ã—  eralization of a natural image, we can then establish a textural sparsity assumption for natural images, where the global textural characteristics of an image can be well-represented by a small set of distinctive local textural representations. [sent-121, score-2.397]
</p><p>47 This compact, sparse representation of the global, heterogeneous textural characteristics of an image motivates the use of a sparse texture model. [sent-122, score-1.144]

</p><p>51 In this work, we first consider a salient region of interest as regions that have highly unique and distinctive textural characteristics when compared to the rest of the scene (see Fig. [sent-135, score-1.057]
</p><p>52 As such, we are motivated to introduce a metric for quantifying the uniqueness and distinctiveness of texture patterns within an image relative to each other. [sent-137, score-0.502]
</p><p>53 Here, we introduce the con-  cept of statistical textural distinctiveness, where an area of interest is salient if it has low textural pattern commonality compared to the rest of the scene. [sent-138, score-1.796]
</p><p>54 As such, the concept of statistical textural distinctiveness takes explicit advantage of the statistical relationships between texture patterns within an image to discern underlying saliency. [sent-139, score-1.431]

</p><p>58 If the noise process Î·i,j is assumed to be independent and identically distributed, the probability of tir being a realization of tjr can be written as:  +  P(tir|tjr) =  YP(tir,k|tjr,k),  (7)  Yk  where tir,k is the kth element in the texture atom tir. [sent-143, score-0.562]

</p><p>60 Given the aforementioned definition of statistical textural distinctiveness, one can then construct a weighted graphical model to characterize all pair-wise statistical textural distinctiveness within the sparse texture model of the image, which can be described as follows.

<p>Author: Qiong Yan, Li Xu, Jianping Shi, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: When dealing with objects with complex structures, saliency detection confronts a critical problem namely that detection accuracy could be adversely affected if salient foreground or background in an image contains small-scale high-contrast patterns. This issue is common in natural images and forms a fundamental challenge for prior methods. We tackle it from a scale point of view and propose a multi-layer approach to analyze saliency cues. The final saliency map is produced in a hierarchical model. Different from varying patch sizes or downsizing images, our scale-based region handling is by finding saliency values optimally in a tree model. Our approach improves saliency detection on many images that cannot be handled well traditionally. A new dataset is also constructed. â€“</p><p>3 0.34025839 <a title="411-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Saliency_Detection_via_Graph-Based_Manifold_Ranking.html">375 cvpr-2013-Saliency Detection via Graph-Based Manifold Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Chuan Yang, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu, Xiang Ruan, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Most existing bottom-up methods measure the foreground saliency of a pixel or region based on its contrast within a local context or the entire image, whereas a few methods focus on segmenting out background regions and thereby salient objects. Instead of considering the contrast between the salient objects and their surrounding regions, we consider both foreground and background cues in a different way. We rank the similarity of the image elements (pixels or regions) with foreground cues or background cues via graph-based manifold ranking. The saliency of the image elements is defined based on their relevances to the given seeds or queries. We represent the image as a close-loop graph with superpixels as nodes. These nodes are ranked based on the similarity to background and foreground queries, based on affinity matrices. Saliency detection is carried out in a two-stage scheme to extract background regions and foreground salient objects efficiently. Experimental results on two large benchmark databases demonstrate the proposed method performs well when against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed. We also create a more difficult bench- mark database containing 5,172 images to test the proposed saliency model and make this database publicly available with this paper for further studies in the saliency field.</p><p>4 0.3335003 <a title="411-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Salient_Object_Detection%3A_A_Discriminative_Regional_Feature_Integration_Approach.html">376 cvpr-2013-Salient Object Detection: A Discriminative Regional Feature Integration Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Keyang Shi, Keze Wang, Jiangbo Lu, Liang Lin</p><p>Abstract: Driven by recent vision and graphics applications such as image segmentation and object recognition, assigning pixel-accurate saliency values to uniformly highlight foreground objects becomes increasingly critical. More often, such fine-grained saliency detection is also desired to have a fast runtime. Motivated by these, we propose a generic and fast computational framework called PISA Pixelwise Image Saliency Aggregating complementary saliency cues based on color and structure contrasts with spatial priors holistically. Overcoming the limitations of previous methods often using homogeneous superpixel-based and color contrast-only treatment, our PISA approach directly performs saliency modeling for each individual pixel and makes use of densely overlapping, feature-adaptive observations for saliency measure computation. We further impose a spatial prior term on each of the two contrast measures, which constrains pixels rendered salient to be compact and also centered in image domain. By fusing complementary contrast measures in such a pixelwise adaptive manner, the detection effectiveness is significantly boosted. Without requiring reliable region segmentation or postâ€“ relaxation, PISA exploits an efficient edge-aware image representation and filtering technique and produces spatially coherent yet detail-preserving saliency maps. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate PISAâ€™s superior detection accuracy and competitive runtime speed over the state-of-the-arts approaches.</p><p>6 0.30179748 <a title="411-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Saliency_Aggregation%3A_A_Data-Driven_Approach.html">374 cvpr-2013-Saliency Aggregation: A Data-Driven Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Long Mai, Yuzhen Niu, Feng Liu</p><p>Abstract: A variety of methods have been developed for visual saliency analysis. These methods often complement each other. This paper addresses the problem of aggregating various saliency analysis methods such that the aggregation result outperforms each individual one. We have two major observations. First, different methods perform differently in saliency analysis. Second, the performance of a saliency analysis method varies with individual images. Our idea is to use data-driven approaches to saliency aggregation that appropriately consider the performance gaps among individual methods and the performance dependence of each method on individual images. This paper discusses various data-driven approaches and finds that the image-dependent aggregation method works best. Specifically, our method uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework for saliency aggregation that not only models the contribution from individual saliency map but also the interaction between neighboringpixels. To account for the dependence of aggregation on an individual image, our approach selects a subset of images similar to the input image from a training data set and trains the CRF aggregation model only using this subset instead of the whole training set. Our experiments on public saliency benchmarks show that our aggregation method outperforms each individual saliency method and is robust with the selection of aggregated methods.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.94423252 <a title="411-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Statistical_Textural_Distinctiveness_for_Salient_Region_Detection_in_Natural_Images.html">411 cvpr-2013-Statistical Textural Distinctiveness for Salient Region Detection in Natural Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Rui Caseiro, Pedro Martins, JoÃ£o F. Henriques, FÃ¡tima Silva Leite, Jorge Batista</p><p>Abstract: In the past few years there has been a growing interest on geometric frameworks to learn supervised classification models on Riemannian manifolds [31, 27]. A popular framework, valid over any Riemannian manifold, was proposed in [31] for binary classification. Once moving from binary to multi-class classification thisparadigm is not valid anymore, due to the spread of multiple positive classes on the manifold [27]. It is then natural to ask whether the multi-class paradigm could be extended to operate on a large class of Riemannian manifolds. We propose a mathematically well-founded classification paradigm that allows to extend the work in [31] to multi-class models, taking into account the structure of the space. The idea is to project all the data from the manifold onto an affine tangent space at a particular point. To mitigate the distortion induced by local diffeomorphisms, we introduce for the first time in the computer vision community a well-founded mathematical concept, so-called Rolling map [21, 16]. The novelty in this alternate school of thought is that the manifold will be firstly rolled (without slipping or twisting) as a rigid body, then the given data is unwrapped onto the affine tangent space, where the classification is performed.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.80227333 <a title="411-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Statistical_Textural_Distinctiveness_for_Salient_Region_Detection_in_Natural_Images.html">411 cvpr-2013-Statistical Textural Distinctiveness for Salient Region Detection in Natural Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Lu Xia, J.K. Aggarwal</p><p>Abstract: Local spatio-temporal interest points (STIPs) and the resulting features from RGB videos have been proven successful at activity recognition that can handle cluttered backgrounds and partial occlusions. In this paper, we propose its counterpart in depth video and show its efficacy on activity recognition. We present a filtering method to extract STIPsfrom depth videos (calledDSTIP) that effectively suppress the noisy measurements. Further, we build a novel depth cuboid similarity feature (DCSF) to describe the local 3D depth cuboid around the DSTIPs with an adaptable supporting size. We test this feature on activity recognition application using the public MSRAction3D, MSRDailyActivity3D datasets and our own dataset. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach outperforms stateof-the-art activity recognition algorithms on depth videos, and the framework is more widely applicable than existing approaches. We also give detailed comparisons with other features and analysis of choice of parameters as a guidance for applications.</p><p>4 0.77572417 <a title="411-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Joint_Model_for_2D_and_3D_Pose_Estimation_from_a_Single_Image.html">14 cvpr-2013-A Joint Model for 2D and 3D Pose Estimation from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Edgar Simo-Serra, Ariadna Quattoni, Carme Torras, Francesc Moreno-Noguer</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to automatically recover 3D human pose from a single image. Most previous work follows a pipelined approach: initially, a set of 2D features such as edges, joints or silhouettes are detected in the image, and then these observations are used to infer the 3D pose. Solving these two problems separately may lead to erroneous 3D poses when the feature detector has performed poorly. In this paper, we address this issue by jointly solving both the 2D detection and the 3D inference problems. For this purpose, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates a generative model based on latent variables and discriminative 2D part detectors based on HOGs, and perform inference using evolutionary algorithms. Real experimentation demonstrates competitive results, and the ability of our methodology to provide accurate 2D and 3D pose estimations even when the 2D detectors are inaccurate.</p><p>5 0.76762831 <a title="411-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-3D_Pictorial_Structures_for_Multiple_View_Articulated_Pose_Estimation.html">2 cvpr-2013-3D Pictorial Structures for Multiple View Articulated Pose Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Magnus Burenius, Josephine Sullivan, Stefan Carlsson</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of automatically estimating the 3D pose of humans from images, taken from multiple calibrated views. We show that it is possible and tractable to extend the pictorial structures framework, popular for 2D pose estimation, to 3D. We discuss how to use this framework to impose view, skeleton, joint angle and intersection constraints in 3D. The 3D pictorial structures are evaluated on multiple view data from a professional football game. The evaluation is focused on computational tractability, but we also demonstrate how a simple 2D part detector can be plugged into the framework.</p><p>6 0.76407766 <a title="411-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_Pose_Estimation_Using_Discriminative_Armlet_Classifiers.html">45 cvpr-2013-Articulated Pose Estimation Using Discriminative Armlet Classifiers</a></p>

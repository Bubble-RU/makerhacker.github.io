</p><p>2 In this paper we introduce a promising way to bridge this gap based on partial optimality and structural properties of the underlying problem factorization. [sent-4, score-0.804]
</p><p>3 On the hitherto unsolva2b04le8 C×h2i0ne4s8e character dataset of Nowozin et al. [sent-6, score-0.143]
</p><p>4 we obtain provably optimal results in 56% of the instances and achieve competitive runtimes on other recent benchmark problems. [sent-7, score-0.317]
</p><p>5 Introduction We consider the problem of finding the most likely configuration of a discrete graphical model, which is equivalent to an energy minimization problem, cf. [sent-10, score-0.228]
</p><p>6 The efficient computation of the maximum flow has also been used to provide partial optimality on binary [27] and multilabel problems [22, 17]. [sent-18, score-0.677]
</p><p>7 This partial optimality has been employed to extend the expansion and swap methods to arbitrary functions by so-called fusion moves [23] and to reduce the problem size for the algorithms mentioned above in order to reduce their runtime [3]. [sent-19, score-0.709]
</p><p>8 In the last years combinatorial methods based on cuttingplane and branch-and-bound techniques have come more  into focus in the computer vision community [4, 16, 26, 10, 34]. [sent-20, score-0.12]
</p><p>9 The main advantage of these methods is that they provide globally optimal integer solutions if no runtime restrictions are specified. [sent-21, score-0.254]
</p><p>10 However, combinatorial methods do not scale well and as we will show often do not explore the full structural and functional properties of the problems. [sent-23, score-0.214]
</p><p>11 We suggest a set of preprocessing methods that reduce the original problem size and can be calculated in polynomial time. [sent-26, score-0.131]
</p><p>12 One method is based on partial optimality similar to [3]. [sent-27, score-0.575]
</p><p>13 After employing partial optimality several structural properties can be used in a novel way to further reduce the problem size. [sent-28, score-0.669]
</p><p>14 Although these structural properties are simple, they are currently not fully exploited by stateof-the-art combinatorial methods. [sent-29, score-0.214]
</p><p>15 Furthermore and contrary to [3], which only uses partial optimality to speed up approximative methods, we combine reduction techniques with exact optimization methods. [sent-30, score-0.846]
</p><p>16 As a consequence, we are able to solve a significantly wider range of large scale problems to optimality that were not feasible for combinatorial methods before and demonstrate this by a comprehensive evaluation. [sent-31, score-0.603]
</p><p>17 3 we introduce several methods to solve discrete optimization problems to optimality. [sent-35, score-0.113]
</p><p>18 Problem Formulation  Our problem is defined by a factor graph: a bipartite graph G = (V, F, E) which consists of regular nodes V, factor nodes F and an edge set E ⊆ V F. [sent-42, score-0.196]
</p><p>19 The cardinality of this set, |b bn(bf()f:=) =|, {isv c ∈alVled | t(vhe, o)r∈deEr} of the factor, factors of order 1 |annbd( f2) are called unary and pairwise factors, respectively. [sent-48, score-0.117]
</p><p>20 A factor graph defines a binary problem if |Xv| = 2 fofr ∈all F v ∈ V and a multi-label problem if |Xv | > 2 f|oXr some v ∈ V. [sent-50, score-0.159]
</p><p>21 Using a |fXac|to >r graph, tmhee energy minimization problem takes the form  xm∈XinVf∑∈Fϕf(xnb(f)). [sent-51, score-0.118]
</p><p>22 (1)  Because factor graphs make the structural properties induced by the discrete Markov random field explicit, they enable efficient access to structural properties that support exact inference using combinatorial optimization. [sent-52, score-0.575]
</p><p>23 In addition to the structural properties of the problem, properties of the functions ϕf(·) are also of major interest from the point of view of optimization, e. [sent-53, score-0.131]
</p><p>24 , submodular functions can be solved in polynomial time [25]. [sent-55, score-0.149]
</p><p>25 Problems containing unary and Potts functions only can be reformulated as a multiway cut [16] and in the case of second order binary problems as a max cut instance [11, 32]. [sent-56, score-0.483]
</p><p>26 Additional to the constraints of linear programming relaxations over the local polytope, which are common in computer vision, it contains integer constraints that enforce consistency with (1). [sent-64, score-0.155]
</p><p>27 [16] suggested a transformation of generalized Potts models into a multiway cut problem and introduced a cutting-plane framework for optimization. [sent-75, score-0.234]
</p><p>28 Max Cut by Branch-and-Cut (MCBC) In [5], Bonato developed a method for solving max cut problems to optimality using a branch-and-cut framework. [sent-78, score-0.62]
</p><p>29 In addition to using the standard cycle relaxation for the cut polytope he employs special separation and lifting techniques for deriving further inequalities that tighten the relaxation. [sent-79, score-0.241]
</p><p>30 The algorithm is in particular very well suited for sparse graphs and applied to  computer vision problems for the first time in the present paper. [sent-80, score-0.107]
</p><p>31 describe a method to compute a maximum cut in a planar graph by exploiting a correspondence between maximum cuts and minimum perfect matchings [32]. [sent-83, score-0.149]
</p><p>32 In order for this to work, a so-called consistent collection of graphs that builds a cycle basis for the input graph is needed. [sent-85, score-0.125]
</p><p>33 Consequently, one can calculate an optimal solution for a subset of the variables in order to reduce the problem size, as sketched in Fig. [sent-90, score-0.145]
</p><p>34 This can for example be achieved by the concept of roof duality [6], as it was done for binary pairwise models [27] as well as for multi-label pairwise models [22, 17]. [sent-92, score-0.152]
</p><p>35 Afterap lyingQPBO−,t→henodeswithknownvalue(black  dots) can be removed after modifying the factors connected to them appropriately (red). [sent-96, score-0.114]
</p><p>36 Partial optimality has already been used in [3] to speed up approximative methods. [sent-97, score-0.546]
</p><p>37 By contrast, in the present paper, we systematically exploit partial optimality and problem reduction to make exact combinatorial methods feasible for large problem sizes. [sent-98, score-0.838]
</p><p>38 Connected Components (c) If the factor graph G is disconnected, the individual connected components can obviously be treated separately as sketched in Fig. [sent-101, score-0.277]
</p><p>39 We suggest to use a preprocessing step that detects connected components in polynomial time, e. [sent-103, score-0.247]
</p><p>40 3 we show the runtimes of ILP on a problem consisting of three fully connected cliques with an increasing number of variables. [sent-110, score-0.268]
</p><p>41 ILP-c detects connected components and solves each of them independently. [sent-111, score-0.116]
</p><p>42 Bridge Elimination (b) We call a factor f ∈ F a bridge factor if the number of connected components o∈f GF increases when f is removed. [sent-113, score-0.399]
</p><p>43 After removing a bridge factor, the resulting components can be treated separately. [sent-114, score-0.173]
</p><p>44 When doing so while fixing the variables in nb(f) for all possible assignments, one side of the bridge can be shrunken to a lower order factor representing the optimal values of this subgraph, cf. [sent-115, score-0.398]
</p><p>45 After solving the reduced problem, the optimal configuration of the shrunken part can easily be recovered. [sent-118, score-0.127]
</p><p>46 The right side of the original graph, including f,can be shrunken to a unary factor f? [sent-127, score-0.202]
</p><p>47 Tentacle Elimination (t) A special case in which bridge elimination can be used very efficiently is when one side of  the bridge is acyclic such that dynamic programming can be applied. [sent-130, score-0.529]
</p><p>48 Automatic detection and elimination of these acyclic substructures is done in polynomial time. [sent-131, score-0.333]
</p><p>49 We call this tentacle elimination, since the parts that can be eliminated are attached to the main part of the graph like tentacles, as depicted in Fig. [sent-132, score-0.17]
</p><p>50 les)i at ched  to the main part of the graph, one round of dynamic programming can be used to replace this subgraph by a single unary factor f? [sent-138, score-0.208]
</p><p>51 The basic idea behind bridge and tentacle elimination is also known as variable conditioning and variable elimination, cf. [sent-141, score-0.434]
</p><p>52 For evaluation we count how often a method provides the best energy value among all competing methods (best) and how often the gap between the energy value and the lower bound was less than 10−7 (ver. [sent-156, score-0.201]
</p><p>53 Synthetic Binary Grid Models We created problems where the underlying graph is a grid graph of size 32 32, 64 64, . [sent-163, score-0.218]
</p><p>54 Problems of this type can be transformed into pure max cut problems as described in [32]. [sent-172, score-0.202]
</p><p>55 For MCBC and RPM, we transform the problems into max cut instances and solve those. [sent-173, score-0.285]
</p><p>56 As expected, the runtimes decrease by orders of magnitudes when we apply QPBO to get partial optimal solutions first, cf. [sent-174, score-0.391]
</p><p>57 This is not possible for RPM since it needs certain embeddings which are easy to compute for the original grid problems but not for the reduced ones. [sent-177, score-0.122]
</p><p>58 However, we achieve another tremendous reduction of the runtime by taking into account that the reduced problems are 1We do not include the general bridge elimination (b) here because so far only implemented its special case (t). [sent-180, score-0.6]
</p><p>59 Average runtimes of those instances that could be solved in less than one hour (compare Fig. [sent-182, score-0.405]
</p><p>60 For all methods reduction makes them applicable to larger instances. [sent-184, score-0.128]
</p><p>61 Fraction of the ten instances per grid size that could be solved within one hour ( ), that could not be solved due to the time limit of one hour ( ), and that could not be solved due to  ××  an out-of-memory error ( ). [sent-187, score-0.477]
</p><p>62 Using the three proposed reduction techniques makes methods applicable to larger instances. [sent-188, score-0.128]
</p><p>63 mostly disconnected and treating the connected components as independent problems. [sent-190, score-0.116]
</p><p>64 We do not apply the connected component reduction for BRAOBB explicitly because this is already taken into account by the method itself. [sent-192, score-0.167]
</p><p>65 For MCBC, we only apply the partial optimality reduction due to limited access. [sent-194, score-0.664]
</p><p>66 Variables are connected to more than 30 other variables by pairwise factors. [sent-208, score-0.176]
</p><p>67 Common approximations using local polytope relaxations do not perform well on these problems, and standard ILP solvers are not able to guarantee optimality in one hour, even if partial optimality is used to reduce the problem size. [sent-209, score-1.145]
</p><p>68 For the Chinese character dataset, partial optimality has reduced the problem size from 4992–17 856 to 502–1 093 variables. [sent-210, score-0.663]
</p><p>69 Using MCBC [5] with the partial optimality reduction, we were able to verify optimality for 56 instances. [sent-212, score-0.993]
</p><p>70 To obtain partial optimality, we use the method of Kovtun [22] and therefore restrict ourselves to second order Potts functions. [sent-248, score-0.157]
</p><p>71 While the standard multiway cut method [16] takes on average more than two minutes, we obtain runtimes comparable to state-of-the-art methods by using partial optimality for problem reduction and contrary to those verified globally optimal solutions, cf. [sent-251, score-1.097]
</p><p>72 The reduction obtained by partial optimality was between 95% and 99. [sent-254, score-0.664]
</p><p>73 However, on this dataset MCA-pct is comparable to approximative state-of-the-art methods in terms of runtime and provides optimality. [sent-290, score-0.262]
</p><p>74 Furthermore, we would like to point out that most of the runtime of MCA-pct is spent for the calculation of partial optimality. [sent-291, score-0.291]
</p><p>75 We also apply model reduction for approximative methods as in [3]. [sent-292, score-0.217]
</p><p>76 This improves the runtimes and energies of  ×  TRWS and α-exp as can also be seen in Tab. [sent-293, score-0.19]
</p><p>77 We use simulated 3D MRI brain data [1] and calculate the five color modes in the histogram. [sent-297, score-0.118]
</p><p>78 We can reduce the runtime to less than half a minute by using partial optimality, connected  components, and tentacle elimination, cf. [sent-309, score-0.491]
</p><p>79 Notably, TRWS found the optimal bound but was not able to find the optimal integer solution during 1000 iterations. [sent-313, score-0.207]
</p><p>80 For MCA-pct, 951 982 variables are eliminated by partial optimality and 7 391 by tentacle elimination. [sent-314, score-0.759]
</p><p>81 Results on the brain dataset with 7 mm slices [1] algorithm runtime energy bound best ver. [sent-317, score-0.377]

</p><p>83 For the approximate methods we show the gap to the optimal energy in Fig. [sent-330, score-0.123]
</p><p>84 TRWS performs good but has worse runtimes than MCA-pct. [sent-332, score-0.19]
</p><p>85 Runtimes for the brain dataset for different slice thicknesses which result in different numbers of variables. [sent-334, score-0.173]
</p><p>86 While for MCA, the speedup caused by model-reduction is large, it is moderate or not present for approximative methods. [sent-335, score-0.128]
</p><p>87 Conclusions We compared for the first time several combinatorial optimization methods, some not considered for computer vision problems so far, in connection with polynomial time preprocessing steps that make those methods applicable to large scale computer vision problems. [sent-337, score-0.355]
</p><p>88 Energy gaps to the optimal energy for the brain dataset for different slice thicknesses which result in different numbers of variables. [sent-339, score-0.296]
</p><p>89 We showed that such solvers are often “blind” for simple structural properties of the problems. [sent-341, score-0.147]
</p><p>90 Using the proposed preprocessing, we were able to solve significantly larger problem instances to global optimality that have not been solved before and to reduce the runtime for exact methods substantially so as to make them applicable to real world computer vision applications. [sent-342, score-0.766]
</p><p>91 Finally, our approach requires the presence of partial optimality, and so far we only considered two methods to provide this. [sent-345, score-0.157]
</p><p>92 [35] published a new algorithm to obtain partial optimality in Potts models which increases the number of known variables significantly. [sent-347, score-0.637]
</p><p>93 In  future work we will employ this method, consider methods for higher order factors, methods that provide stronger partial optimality criteria, as well as methods for general pairwise terms. [sent-348, score-0.611]

<p>Author: Jörg H. Kappes, Bjoern Andres, Fred A. Hamprecht, Christoph Schnörr, Sebastian Nowozin, Dhruv Batra, Sungwoong Kim, Bernhard X. Kausler, Jan Lellmann, Nikos Komodakis, Carsten Rother</p><p>Abstract: Seven years ago, Szeliski et al. published an influential study on energy minimization methods for Markov random fields (MRF). This study provided valuable insights in choosing the best optimization technique for certain classes of problems. While these insights remain generally useful today, the phenominal success of random field models means that the kinds of inference problems we solve have changed significantly. Specifically, the models today often include higher order interactions, flexible connectivity structures, large label-spaces of different cardinalities, or learned energy tables. To reflect these changes, we provide a modernized and enlarged study. We present an empirical comparison of 24 state-of-art techniques on a corpus of 2,300 energy minimization instances from 20 diverse computer vision applications. To ensure reproducibility, we evaluate all methods in the OpenGM2 framework and report extensive results regarding runtime and solution quality. Key insights from our study agree with the results of Szeliski et al. for the types of models they studied. However, on new and challenging types of models our findings disagree and suggest that polyhedral methods and integer programming solvers are competitive in terms of runtime and solution quality over a large range of model types.</p><p>3 0.1207418 <a title="436-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Practical_Rank-Constrained_Eight-Point_Algorithm_for_Fundamental_Matrix_Estimation.html">23 cvpr-2013-A Practical Rank-Constrained Eight-Point Algorithm for Fundamental Matrix Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yinqiang Zheng, Shigeki Sugimoto, Masatoshi Okutomi</p><p>Abstract: Due to its simplicity, the eight-point algorithm has been widely used in fundamental matrix estimation. Unfortunately, the rank-2 constraint of a fundamental matrix is enforced via a posterior rank correction step, thus leading to non-optimal solutions to the original problem. To address this drawback, existing algorithms need to solve either a very high order polynomial or a sequence of convex relaxation problems, both of which are computationally ineffective and numerically unstable. In this work, we present a new rank-2 constrained eight-point algorithm, which directly incorporates the rank-2 constraint in the minimization process. To avoid singularities, we propose to solve seven subproblems and retrieve their globally optimal solutions by using tailored polynomial system solvers. Our proposed method is noniterative, computationally efficient and numerically stable. Experiment results have verified its superiority over existing algebraic error based algorithms in terms of accuracy, as well as its advantages when used to initialize geometric error based algorithms.</p><p>4 0.11884797 <a title="436-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Continuous_Inference_in_Graphical_Models_with_Polynomial_Energies.html">95 cvpr-2013-Continuous Inference in Graphical Models with Polynomial Energies</a></p>
<p>Author: Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of performing inference in graphical models whose energy is a polynomial function of continuous variables. Our energy minimization method follows a dual decomposition approach, where the global problem is split into subproblems defined over the graph cliques. The optimal solution to these subproblems is obtained by making use of a polynomial system solver. Our algorithm inherits the convergence guarantees of dual decomposition. To speed up optimization, we also introduce a variant of this algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian method.

<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>6 0.10161204 <a title="436-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Principled_Deep_Random_Field_Model_for_Image_Segmentation.html">24 cvpr-2013-A Principled Deep Random Field Model for Image Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Stefano Soatto, Shing-Tung Yau</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient approach to integrating non-local statistics into the higher-order Markov Random Fields (MRFs) framework. Motivated by the observation that many non-local statistics (e.g., shape priors, color distributions) can usually be represented by a small number of parameters, we reformulate the higher-order MRF model by introducing additional latent variables to represent the intrinsic dimensions of the higher-order cliques. The resulting new model, called NC-MRF, not only provides the flexibility in representing the configurations of higher-order cliques, but also automatically decomposes the energy function into less coupled terms, allowing us to design an efficient algorithmic framework for maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Based on this novel modeling/inference framework, we achieve state-of-the-art solutions to the challenging problems of class-specific image segmentation and template-based 3D facial expression tracking, which demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>6 0.69347024 <a title="436-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-An_Iterated_L1_Algorithm_for_Non-smooth_Non-convex_Optimization_in_Computer_Vision.html">41 cvpr-2013-An Iterated L1 Algorithm for Non-smooth Non-convex Optimization in Computer Vision</a></p>

<p>Author: Nikolaos Kyriazis, Antonis Argyros</p><p>Abstract: In several hand-object(s) interaction scenarios, the change in the objects ’ state is a direct consequence of the hand’s motion. This has a straightforward representation in Newtonian dynamics. We present the first approach that exploits this observation to perform model-based 3D tracking of a table-top scene comprising passive objects and an active hand. Our forward modelling of 3D hand-object(s) interaction regards both the appearance and the physical state of the scene and is parameterized over the hand motion (26 DoFs) between two successive instants in time. We demonstrate that our approach manages to track the 3D pose of all objects and the 3D pose and articulation of the hand by only searching for the parameters of the hand motion. In the proposed framework, covert scene state is inferred by connecting it to the overt state, through the incorporation of physics. Thus, our tracking approach treats a variety of challenging observability issues in a principled manner, without the need to resort to heuristics.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81885487 <a title="436-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Efficient_and_Exact_MAP-Inference_for_Large_Scale_Discrete_Computer_Vision_Problems_via_Combinatorial_Optimization.html">436 cvpr-2013-Towards Efficient and Exact MAP-Inference for Large Scale Discrete Computer Vision Problems via Combinatorial Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Gim Hee Lee, Friedrich Faundorfer, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a visual ego-motion estimation algorithm for a self-driving car equipped with a closeto-market multi-camera system. By modeling the multicamera system as a generalized camera and applying the non-holonomic motion constraint of a car, we show that this leads to a novel 2-point minimal solution for the generalized essential matrix where the full relative motion including metric scale can be obtained. We provide the analytical solutions for the general case with at least one inter-camera correspondence and a special case with only intra-camera correspondences. We show that up to a maximum of 6 solutions exist for both cases. We identify the existence of degeneracy when the car undergoes straight motion in the special case with only intra-camera correspondences where the scale becomes unobservable and provide a practical alternative solution. Our formulation can be efficiently implemented within RANSAC for robust estimation. We verify the validity of our assumptions on the motion model by comparing our results on a large real-world dataset collected by a car equipped with 4 cameras with minimal overlapping field-of-views against the GPS/INS ground truth.</p><p>4 0.77814591 <a title="436-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Re-ranking_of_Diverse_Segmentations.html">132 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Re-ranking of Diverse Segmentations</a></p>

In the first stage a probabilistic model generates a set of diverse plausible segmentations. In the second stage, a discriminatively trained re-ranking model selects the best segmentation from this set. The re-ranking stage can use much more complex features than what could be tractably used in the probabilistic model, allowing a better exploration of the solution space than possible by simply producing the most probable solution from the probabilistic model. While our proposed approach already achieves state-of-the-art results (48.1%) on the challenging VOC 2012 dataset, our machine and human analyses suggest that even larger gains are possible with such an approach.</p><p>5 0.73460847 <a title="436-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Comparative_Study_of_Modern_Inference_Techniques_for_Discrete_Energy_Minimization_Problems.html">6 cvpr-2013-A Comparative Study of Modern Inference Techniques for Discrete Energy Minimization Problems</a></p>

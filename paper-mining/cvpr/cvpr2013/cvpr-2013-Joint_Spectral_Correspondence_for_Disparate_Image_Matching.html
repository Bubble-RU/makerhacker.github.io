<p>Author: Jaechul Kim, Ce Liu, Fei Sha, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a fast deformable spatial pyramid (DSP) matching algorithm for computing dense pixel correspondences. Dense matching methods typically enforce both appearance agreement between matched pixels as well as geometric smoothness between neighboring pixels. Whereas the prevailing approaches operate at the pixel level, we propose a pyramid graph model that simultaneously regularizes match consistency at multiple spatial extents—ranging from an entire image, to coarse grid cells, to every single pixel. This novel regularization substantially improves pixel-level matching in the face of challenging image variations, while the “deformable ” aspect of our model overcomes the strict rigidity of traditional spatial pyramids. Results on LabelMe and Caltech show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods (SIFT Flow [15] and PatchMatch [2]), both in terms of accuracy and run time.</p><p>3 0.12398001 <a title="234-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Constraints_as_Features.html">93 cvpr-2013-Constraints as Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Shmuel Asafi, Daniel Cohen-Or</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach to constrained clustering which treats the constraints as features. Our method augments the original feature space with additional dimensions, each of which derived from a given Cannot-link constraints. The specified Cannot-link pair gets extreme coordinates values, and the rest of the points get coordinate values that express their spatial influence from the specified constrained pair. After augmenting all the new features, a standard unconstrained clustering algorithm can be performed, like k-means or spectral clustering. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method for active semi-supervised learning applied to image segmentation and compare it to alternative methods. We also evaluate the performance of our method on the four most commonly evaluated datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.</p><p>4 0.11505345 <a title="234-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Keypoints_from_Symmetries_by_Wave_Propagation.html">240 cvpr-2013-Keypoints from Symmetries by Wave Propagation</a></p>

While the image structures found by most state-of-the-art detectors, such as blobs and corners, occur typically on planar highly textured surfaces, salient symmetries are widespread in diverse kinds of images, including those related to untextured objects, which are hardly dealt with by current feature-based recognition pipelines. We provide experimental results on standard datasets and also contribute with a new dataset focused on untextured objects. Based on the positive experimental results, we hope to foster further research on the promising topic ofscale invariant analysis through the wave equation.</p><p>5 0.11480828 <a title="234-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Winding_Number_for_Region-Boundary_Consistent_Salient_Contour_Extraction.html">468 cvpr-2013-Winding Number for Region-Boundary Consistent Salient Contour Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Yansheng Ming, Hongdong Li, Xuming He</p><p>Abstract: This paper aims to extract salient closed contours from an image. For this vision task, both region segmentation cues (e.g. color/texture homogeneity) and boundary detection cues (e.g. local contrast, edge continuity and contour closure) play important and complementary roles. In this paper we show how to combine both cues in a unified framework. The main focus is given to how to maintain the consistency (compatibility) between the region cues and the boundary cues. To this ends, we introduce the use of winding number–a well-known concept in topology–as a powerful mathematical device. By this device, the region-boundary consistency is represented as a set of simple linear relationships. Our method is applied to the figure-ground segmentation problem. The experiments show clearly improved results.</p><p>6 0.11348893 <a title="234-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Active_Contours_with_Group_Similarity.html">33 cvpr-2013-Active Contours with Group Similarity</a></p>

<p>Author: Simon Korman, Daniel Reichman, Gilad Tsur, Shai Avidan</p><p>Abstract: Fast-Match is a fast algorithm for approximate template matching under 2D affine transformations that minimizes the Sum-of-Absolute-Differences (SAD) error measure. There is a huge number of transformations to consider but we prove that they can be sampled using a density that depends on the smoothness of the image. For each potential transformation, we approximate the SAD error using a sublinear algorithm that randomly examines only a small number of pixels. We further accelerate the algorithm using a branch-and-bound scheme. As images are known to be piecewise smooth, the result is a practical affine template matching algorithm with approximation guarantees, that takes a few seconds to run on a standard machine. We perform several experiments on three different datasets, and report very good results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first template matching algorithm which is guaranteed to handle arbitrary 2D affine transformations.</p><p>4 0.73219776 <a title="234-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Fast_and_Accurate_Segmentation.html">437 cvpr-2013-Towards Fast and Accurate Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Simon Hawe, Matthias Seibert, Martin Kleinsteuber</p><p>Abstract: Many techniques in computer vision, machine learning, and statistics rely on the fact that a signal of interest admits a sparse representation over some dictionary. Dictionaries are either available analytically, or can be learned from a suitable training set. While analytic dictionaries permit to capture the global structure of a signal and allow a fast implementation, learned dictionaries often perform better in applications as they are more adapted to the considered class of signals. In imagery, unfortunately, the numerical burden for (i) learning a dictionary and for (ii) employing the dictionary for reconstruction tasks only allows to deal with relatively small image patches that only capture local image information. The approach presented in this paper aims at overcoming these drawbacks by allowing a separable structure on the dictionary throughout the learning process. On the one hand, this permits larger patch-sizes for the learning phase, on the other hand, the dictionary is applied efficiently in reconstruction tasks. The learning procedure is based on optimizing over a product of spheres which updates the dictionary as a whole, thus enforces basic dictionary proper- , ties such as mutual coherence explicitly during the learning procedure. In the special case where no separable structure is enforced, our method competes with state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods like K-SVD.</p><p>4 0.78420746 <a title="234-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Lagrangian_Relaxation_to_Min-cost_Network_Flow.html">300 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Asad A. Butt, Robert T. Collins</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for global multi-target tracking that can incorporate higher-order track smoothness constraints such as constant velocity. Our problem formulation readily lends itself to path estimation in a trellis graph, but unlike previous methods, each node in our network represents a candidate pair of matching observations between consecutive frames. Extra constraints on binary flow variables in the graph result in a problem that can no longer be solved by min-cost network flow. We therefore propose an iterative solution method that relaxes these extra constraints using Lagrangian relaxation, resulting in a series of problems that ARE solvable by min-cost flow, and that progressively improve towards a high-quality solution to our original optimization problem. We present experimental results showing that our method outperforms the standard network-flow formulation as well as other recent algorithms that attempt to incorporate higher-order smoothness constraints.</p><p>5 0.78031099 <a title="234-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>6 0.77766603 <a title="234-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-The_Variational_Structure_of_Disparity_and_Regularization_of_4D_Light_Fields.html">431 cvpr-2013-The Variational Structure of Disparity and Regularization of 4D Light Fields</a></p>

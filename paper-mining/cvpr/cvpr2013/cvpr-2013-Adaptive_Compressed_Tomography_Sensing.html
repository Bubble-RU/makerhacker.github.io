<p>Author: Giuseppe Ottaviano, Pushmeet Kohli</p><p>Abstract: Traditional video compression methods obtain a compact representation for image frames by computing coarse motion fields defined on patches of pixels called blocks, in order to compensate for the motion in the scene across frames. This piecewise constant approximation makes the motion field efficiently encodable, but it introduces block artifacts in the warped image frame. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating dense motion fields that, while accurately predicting one frame from a given reference frame by warping it with the field, are also compressible. We introduce a representation for motion fields based on wavelet bases, and approximate the compressibility of their coefficients with a piecewise smooth surrogate function that yields an objective function similar to classical optical flow formulations. We then show how to quantize and encode such coefficients with adaptive precision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by com- paring its performance with a state-of-the-art wavelet video encoder. Experimental results on a number of standard flow and video datasets reveal that our method significantly outperforms both block-based and optical-flow-based motion compensation algorithms.</p><p>3 0.085963354 <a title="35-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-BRDF_Slices%3A_Accurate_Adaptive_Anisotropic_Appearance_Acquisition.html">54 cvpr-2013-BRDF Slices: Accurate Adaptive Anisotropic Appearance Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Jirí Filip, Radomír Vávra, Michal Haindl, Pavel Žid, Mikuláš Krupika, Vlastimil Havran</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce unique publicly available dense anisotropic BRDF data measurements. We use this dense data as a reference for performance evaluation of the proposed BRDF sparse angular sampling and interpolation approach. The method is based on sampling of BRDF subspaces at fixed elevations by means of several adaptively-represented, uniformly distributed, perpendicular slices. Although this proposed method requires only a sparse sampling of material, the interpolation provides a very accurate reconstruction, visually and computationally comparable to densely measured reference. Due to the simple slices measurement and method’s robustness it allows for a highly accurate acquisition of BRDFs. This in comparison with standard uniform angular sampling, is considerably faster yet uses far less samples.</p><p>4 0.068268508 <a title="35-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Handling_Noise_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_Using_Directional_Filters.html">198 cvpr-2013-Handling Noise in Single Image Deblurring Using Directional Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Lin Zhong, Sunghyun Cho, Dimitris Metaxas, Sylvain Paris, Jue Wang</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art single image deblurring techniques are sensitive to image noise. Even a small amount of noise, which is inevitable in low-light conditions, can degrade the quality of blur kernel estimation dramatically. The recent approach of Tai and Lin [17] tries to iteratively denoise and deblur a blurry and noisy image. However, as we show in this work, directly applying image denoising methods often partially damages the blur information that is extracted from the input image, leading to biased kernel estimation. We propose a new method for handling noise in blind image deconvolution based on new theoretical and practical insights. Our key observation is that applying a directional low-pass filter to the input image greatly reduces the noise level, while preserving the blur information in the orthogonal direction to the filter. Based on this observation, our method applies a series of directional filters at different orientations to the input image, and estimates an accurate Radon transform of the blur kernel from each filtered image. Finally, we reconstruct the blur kernel using inverse Radon transform. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our algorithm achieves higher quality results than previous approaches on blurry and noisy images. 1</p><p>5 0.06236067 <a title="35-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution_Shape_Analysis_via_Non-Euclidean_Wavelets%3A_Applications_to_Mesh_Segmentation_and_Surface_Alignment_Problems.html">297 cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution Shape Analysis via Non-Euclidean Wavelets: Applications to Mesh Segmentation and Surface Alignment Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Won Hwa Kim, Moo K. Chung, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of 3-D shape meshes is a fundamental problem in computer vision, graphics, and medical imaging. Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape ’s local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks). We give an extensive set of comparison results on a large shape segmentation benchmark and derive a uniqueness theorem for the surface alignment problem.</p><p>6 0.053565405 <a title="35-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Theory_of_Refractive_Photo-Light-Path_Triangulation.html">27 cvpr-2013-A Theory of Refractive Photo-Light-Path Triangulation</a></p>

<p>Author: Margret Keuper, Thorsten Schmidt, Maja Temerinac-Ott, Jan Padeken, Patrick Heun, Olaf Ronneberger, Thomas Brox</p><p>Abstract: With volumetric data from widefield fluorescence microscopy, many emerging questions in biological and biomedical research are being investigated. Data can be recorded with high temporal resolution while the specimen is only exposed to a low amount of phototoxicity. These advantages come at the cost of strong recording blur caused by the infinitely extended point spread function (PSF). For widefield microscopy, its magnitude only decays with the square of the distance to the focal point and consists of an airy bessel pattern which is intricate to describe in the spatial domain. However, the Fourier transform of the incoherent PSF (denoted as Optical Transfer Function (OTF)) is well localized and smooth. In this paper, we present a blind -fre iburg .de Figure 1.

<p>Author: Minsik Lee, Jungchan Cho, Chong-Ho Choi, Songhwai Oh</p><p>Abstract: Non-rigid structure from motion is a fundamental problem in computer vision, which is yet to be solved satisfactorily. The main difficulty of the problem lies in choosing the right constraints for the solution. In this paper, we propose new constraints that are more effective for non-rigid shape recovery. Unlike the other proposals which have mainly focused on restricting the deformation space using rank constraints, our proposal constrains the motion parameters so that the 3D shapes are most closely aligned to each other, which makes the rank constraints unnecessary. Based on these constraints, we define a new class ofprobability distribution called the Procrustean normal distribution and propose a new NRSfM algorithm, EM-PND. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods, and it works well even if there is no temporal dependence between the observed samples.</p><p>5 0.54246002 <a title="35-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Three-Dimensional_Bilateral_Symmetry_Plane_Estimation_in_the_Phase_Domain.html">432 cvpr-2013-Three-Dimensional Bilateral Symmetry Plane Estimation in the Phase Domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Ramakrishna Kakarala, Prabhu Kaliamoorthi, Vittal Premachandran</p><p>Abstract: We show that bilateral symmetry plane estimation for three-dimensional (3-D) shapes may be carried out accurately, and efficiently, in the spherical harmonic domain. Our methods are valuable for applications where spherical harmonic expansion is already employed, such as 3-D shape registration, morphometry, and retrieval. We show that the presence of bilateral symmetry in the 3-D shape is equivalent to a linear phase structure in the corresponding spherical harmonic coefficients, and provide algorithms for estimating the orientation of the symmetry plane. The benefit of using spherical harmonic phase is that symmetry estimation reduces to matching a compact set of descriptors, without the need to solve a correspondence problem. Our methods work on point clouds as well as large-scale mesh models of 3-D shapes.</p><p>6 0.53910846 <a title="35-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-As-Projective-As-Possible_Image_Stitching_with_Moving_DLT.html">47 cvpr-2013-As-Projective-As-Possible Image Stitching with Moving DLT</a></p>

<p>Author: Jingchen Liu, Peter Carr, Robert T. Collins, Yanxi Liu</p><p>Abstract: We employ hierarchical data association to track players in team sports. Player movements are often complex and highly correlated with both nearby and distant players. A single model would require many degrees of freedom to represent the full motion diversity and could be difficult to use in practice. Instead, we introduce a set of Game Context Features extracted from noisy detections to describe the current state of the match, such as how the players are spatially distributed. Our assumption is that players react to the current situation in only a finite number of ways. As a result, we are able to select an appropriate simplified affinity model for each player and time instant using a random decisionforest based on current track and game contextfeatures. Our context-conditioned motion models implicitly incorporate complex inter-object correlations while remaining tractable. We demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing multi-target tracking algorithms on basketball and field hockey sequences several minutes in duration and containing 10 and 20 players respectively.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.70089972 <a title="35-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Adaptive_Compressed_Tomography_Sensing.html">35 cvpr-2013-Adaptive Compressed Tomography Sensing</a></p>

We show experimental results where for the same number of line projections, the adaptive model produces higher image quality, when compared with standard limited angle, non-adaptive acquisition algorithms.</p><p>3 0.69415337 <a title="35-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-PDM-ENLOR%3A_Learning_Ensemble_of_Local_PDM-Based_Regressions.html">321 cvpr-2013-PDM-ENLOR: Learning Ensemble of Local PDM-Based Regressions</a></p>
<p>Author: Yen H. Le, Uday Kurkure, Ioannis A. Kakadiaris</p><p>Abstract: Statistical shape models, such as Active Shape Models (ASMs), sufferfrom their inability to represent a large range of variations of a complex shape and to account for the large errors in detection of model points. We propose a novel method (dubbed PDM-ENLOR) that overcomes these limitations by locating each shape model point individually using an ensemble of local regression models and appearance cues from selected model points. Our method first detects a set of reference points which were selected based on their saliency during training. For each model point, an ensemble of regressors is built. From the locations of the detected reference points, each regressor infers a candidate location for that model point using local geometric constraints, encoded by a point distribution model (PDM). The final location of that point is determined as a weighted linear combination, whose coefficients are learnt from the training data, of candidates proposed from its ensemble ’s component regressors. We use different subsets of reference points as explanatory variables for the component regressors to provide varying degrees of locality for the models in each ensemble. This helps our ensemble model to capture a larger range of shape variations as compared to a single PDM. We demonstrate the advantages of our method on the challenging problem of segmenting gene expression images of mouse brain.</p><p>4 0.66936398 <a title="35-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Scalable_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering.html">379 cvpr-2013-Scalable Sparse Subspace Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Xi Peng, Lei Zhang, Zhang Yi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address two problems in Sparse Subspace Clustering algorithm (SSC), i.e., scalability issue and out-of-sample problem. SSC constructs a sparse similarity graph for spectral clustering by using ?1-minimization based coefficients, has achieved state-of-the-art results for image clustering and motion segmentation. However, the time complexity of SSC is proportion to the cubic of problem size such that it is inefficient to apply SSC into large scale setting. Moreover, SSC does not handle with out-ofsample data that are not used to construct the similarity graph. For each new datum, SSC needs recalculating the cluster membership of the whole data set, which makes SSC is not competitive in fast online clustering. To address the problems, this paper proposes out-of-sample extension of SSC, named as Scalable Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSSC), which makes SSC feasible to cluster large scale data sets. The solution of SSSC adopts a ”sampling, clustering, coding, and classifying” strategy. Extensive experimental results on several popular data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><p>5 0.66511893 <a title="35-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Video_Saliency_from_Human_Gaze_Using_Candidate_Selection.html">258 cvpr-2013-Learning Video Saliency from Human Gaze Using Candidate Selection</a></p>
<p>Author: Dmitry Rudoy, Dan B. Goldman, Eli Shechtman, Lihi Zelnik-Manor</p><p>Abstract: During recent years remarkable progress has been made in visual saliency modeling. Our interest is in video saliency. Since videos are fundamentally different from still images, they are viewed differently by human observers. For example, the time each video frame is observed is a fraction of a second, while a still image can be viewed leisurely. Therefore, video saliency estimation methods should differ substantially from image saliency methods. In this paper we propose a novel methodfor video saliency estimation, which is inspired by the way people watch videos. We explicitly model the continuity of the video by predicting the saliency map of a given frame, conditioned on the map from the previousframe. Furthermore, accuracy and computation speed are improved by restricting the salient locations to a carefully selected candidate set. We validate our method using two gaze-tracked video datasets and show we outperform the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.6319223 <a title="35-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Boosting_Binary_Keypoint_Descriptors.html">69 cvpr-2013-Boosting Binary Keypoint Descriptors</a></p>

<p>Author: Felix X. Yu, Liangliang Cao, Rogerio S. Feris, John R. Smith, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Attribute-based representation has shown great promises for visual recognition due to its intuitive interpretation and cross-category generalization property. However, human efforts are usually involved in the attribute designing process, making the representation costly to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation to automatically design discriminative “category-level attributes ”, which can be efficiently encoded by a compact category-attribute matrix. The formulation allows us to achieve intuitive and critical design criteria (category-separability, learnability) in a principled way. The designed attributes can be used for tasks of cross-category knowledge transfer, achieving superior performance over well-known attribute dataset Animals with Attributes (AwA) and a large-scale ILSVRC2010 dataset (1.2M images). This approach also leads to state-ofthe-art performance on the zero-shot learning task on AwA.</p><p>3 0.20353362 <a title="48-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Complex_Event_Detection_via_Multi-source_Video_Attributes.html">85 cvpr-2013-Complex Event Detection via Multi-source Video Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhigang Ma, Yi Yang, Zhongwen Xu, Shuicheng Yan, Nicu Sebe, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Complex events essentially include human, scenes, objects and actions that can be summarized by visual attributes, so leveraging relevant attributes properly could be helpful for event detection. Many works have exploited attributes at image level for various applications. However, attributes at image level are possibly insufficient for complex event detection in videos due to their limited capability in characterizing the dynamic properties of video data. Hence, we propose to leverage attributes at video level (named as video attributes in this work), i.e., the semantic labels of external videos are used as attributes. Compared to complex event videos, these external videos contain simple contents such as objects, scenes and actions which are the basic elements of complex events. Specifically, building upon a correlation vector which correlates the attributes and the complex event, we incorporate video attributes latently as extra informative cues into the event detector learnt from complex event videos. Extensive experiments on a real-world large-scale dataset validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p><p>4 0.20293608 <a title="48-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-It%27s_Not_Polite_to_Point%3A_Describing_People_with_Uncertain_Attributes.html">229 cvpr-2013-It's Not Polite to Point: Describing People with Uncertain Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir Sadovnik, Andrew Gallagher, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: Visual attributes are powerful features for many different applications in computer vision such as object detection and scene recognition. Visual attributes present another application that has not been examined as rigorously: verbal communication from a computer to a human. Since many attributes are nameable, the computer is able to communicate these concepts through language. However, this is not a trivial task. Given a set of attributes, selecting a subset to be communicated is task dependent. Moreover, because attribute classifiers are noisy, it is important to find ways to deal with this uncertainty. We address the issue of communication by examining the task of composing an automatic description of a person in a group photo that distinguishes him from the others. We introduce an efficient, principled methodfor choosing which attributes are included in a short description to maximize the likelihood that a third party will correctly guess to which person the description refers. We compare our algorithm to computer baselines and human describers, and show the strength of our method in creating effective descriptions.</p><p>5 0.20289692 <a title="48-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Adding_Unlabeled_Samples_to_Categories_by_Learned_Attributes.html">36 cvpr-2013-Adding Unlabeled Samples to Categories by Learned Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonghyun Choi, Mohammad Rastegari, Ali Farhadi, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to expand the visual coverage of training sets that consist of a small number of labeled examples using learned attributes. Our optimization formulation discovers category specific attributes as well as the images that have high confidence in terms of the attributes. In addition, we propose a method to stably capture example-specific attributes for a small sized training set. Our method adds images to a category from a large unlabeled image pool, and leads to significant improvement in category recognition accuracy evaluated on a large-scale dataset, ImageNet.</p><p>6 0.19969372 <a title="48-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Simultaneous_Active_Learning_of_Classifiers_%26_Attributes_via_Relative_Feedback.html">396 cvpr-2013-Simultaneous Active Learning of Classifiers & Attributes via Relative Feedback</a></p>

<p>Author: Babak Saleh, Ali Farhadi, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: When describing images, humans tend not to talk about the obvious, but rather mention what they find interesting. We argue that abnormalities and deviations from typicalities are among the most important components that form what is worth mentioning. In this paper we introduce the abnormality detection as a recognition problem and show how to model typicalities and, consequently, meaningful deviations from prototypical properties of categories. Our model can recognize abnormalities and report the main reasons of any recognized abnormality. We also show that abnormality predictions can help image categorization. We introduce the abnormality detection dataset and show interesting results on how to reason about abnormalities.</p><p>5 0.86814684 <a title="48-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Label-Embedding_for_Attribute-Based_Classification.html">241 cvpr-2013-Label-Embedding for Attribute-Based Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Zeynep Akata, Florent Perronnin, Zaid Harchaoui, Cordelia Schmid</p><p>Abstract: Attributes are an intermediate representation, which enables parameter sharing between classes, a must when training data is scarce. We propose to view attribute-based image classification as a label-embedding problem: each class is embedded in the space of attribute vectors. We introduce a function which measures the compatibility between an image and a label embedding. The parameters of this function are learned on a training set of labeled samples to ensure that, given an image, the correct classes rank higher than the incorrect ones. Results on the Animals With Attributes and Caltech-UCSD-Birds datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms the standard Direct Attribute Prediction baseline in a zero-shot learning scenario. The label embedding framework offers other advantages such as the ability to leverage alternative sources of information in addition to attributes (e.g. class hierarchies) or to transition smoothly from zero-shot learning to learning with large quantities of data.</p><p>6 0.85745549 <a title="48-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-attribute_Queries%3A_To_Merge_or_Not_to_Merge%3F.html">293 cvpr-2013-Multi-attribute Queries: To Merge or Not to Merge?</a></p>

However, these problems assume that attributes or defining characteristics of these unobserved classes are known, leveraging this information at test time to detect an unseen class. We address the more realistic problem of detecting categories that do not appear in the dataset in any form. We denote such a category as an unfamiliar class; it is neither observed at train time, nor do we possess any knowledge regarding its relationships to attributes. This problem is one that has received limited attention within the computer vision community. In this work, we propose a novel ap. ucs d .edu Unfamiliar? or?not?

We demonstrate results superior to existing methods on the challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset.</p><p>2 0.73062444 <a title="48-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Graph-Based_Discriminative_Learning_for_Location_Recognition.html">189 cvpr-2013-Graph-Based Discriminative Learning for Location Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Song Cao, Noah Snavely</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing the location of a query image by matching it to a database is an important problem in computer vision, and one for which the representation of the database is a key issue. We explore new ways for exploiting the structure of a database by representing it as a graph, and show how the rich information embedded in a graph can improve a bagof-words-based location recognition method. In particular, starting from a graph on a set of images based on visual connectivity, we propose a method for selecting a set of subgraphs and learning a local distance function for each using discriminative techniques. For a query image, each database image is ranked according to these local distance functions in order to place the image in the right part of the graph. In addition, we propose a probabilistic method for increasing the diversity of these ranked database images, again based on the structure of the image graph. We demonstrate that our methods improve performance over standard bag-of-words methods on several existing location recognition datasets.</p><p>3 0.72062093 <a title="48-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Bringing_Semantics_into_Focus_Using_Visual_Abstraction.html">73 cvpr-2013-Bringing Semantics into Focus Using Visual Abstraction</a></p>
<p>Author: C. Lawrence Zitnick, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Relating visual information to its linguistic semantic meaning remains an open and challenging area of research. The semantic meaning of images depends on the presence of objects, their attributes and their relations to other objects. But precisely characterizing this dependence requires extracting complex visual information from an image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose studying semantic information in abstract images created from collections of clip art. Abstract images provide several advantages. They allow for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic information, since they remove the reliance on noisy low-level object, attribute and relation detectors, or the tedious hand-labeling of images. Importantly, abstract images also allow the ability to generate sets of semantically similar scenes. Finding analogous sets of semantically similar real images would be nearly impossible. We create 1,002 sets of 10 semantically similar abstract scenes with corresponding written descriptions. We thoroughly analyze this dataset to discover semantically important features, the relations of words to visual features and methods for measuring semantic similarity.</p><p>4 0.70758593 <a title="48-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_New_Model_and_Simple_Algorithms_for_Multi-label_Mumford-Shah_Problems.html">20 cvpr-2013-A New Model and Simple Algorithms for Multi-label Mumford-Shah Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Byung-Woo Hong, Zhaojin Lu, Ganesh Sundaramoorthi</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the multi-label Mumford-Shah problem, i.e., the problem of jointly estimating a partitioning of the domain of the image, and functions defined within regions of the partition. We create algorithms that are efficient, robust to undesirable local minima, and are easy-toimplement. Our algorithms are formulated by slightly modifying the underlying statistical model from which the multilabel Mumford-Shah functional is derived. The advantage of this statistical model is that the underlying variables: the labels and thefunctions are less coupled than in the original formulation, and the labels can be computed from the functions with more global updates. The resulting algorithms can be tuned to the desired level of locality of the solution: from fully global updates to more local updates. We demonstrate our algorithm on two applications: joint multi-label segmentation and denoising, and joint multi-label motion segmentation and flow estimation. We compare to the stateof-the-art in multi-label Mumford-Shah problems and show that we achieve more promising results.</p><p>5 0.7049762 <a title="48-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Weakly_Supervised_Learning_for_Attribute_Localization_in_Outdoor_Scenes.html">461 cvpr-2013-Weakly Supervised Learning for Attribute Localization in Outdoor Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuo Wang, Jungseock Joo, Yizhou Wang, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised method for simultaneously learning scene parts and attributes from a collection ofimages associated with attributes in text, where the precise localization of the each attribute left unknown. Our method includes three aspects. (i) Compositional scene configuration. We learn the spatial layouts of the scene by Hierarchical Space Tiling (HST) representation, which can generate an excessive number of scene configurations through the hierarchical composition of a relatively small number of parts. (ii) Attribute association. The scene attributes contain nouns and adjectives corresponding to the objects and their appearance descriptions respectively. We assign the nouns to the nodes (parts) in HST using nonmaximum suppression of their correlation, then train an appearance model for each noun+adjective attribute pair. (iii) Joint inference and learning. For an image, we compute the most probable parse tree with the attributes as an instantiation of the HST by dynamic programming. Then update the HST and attribute association based on the in- ferred parse trees. We evaluate the proposed method by (i) showing the improvement of attribute recognition accuracy; and (ii) comparing the average precision of localizing attributes to the scene parts.</p><p>6 0.70482922 <a title="48-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Rank-1_Tensor_Approximation.html">301 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Rank-1 Tensor Approximation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jeff Donahue, Judy Hoffman, Erik Rodner, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Most successful object classification and detection methods rely on classifiers trained on large labeled datasets. However, for domains where labels are limited, simply borrowing labeled data from existing datasets can hurt performance, a phenomenon known as “dataset bias.” We propose a general framework for adapting classifiers from “borrowed” data to the target domain using a combination of available labeled and unlabeled examples. Specifically, we show that imposing smoothness constraints on the classifier scores over the unlabeled data can lead to improved adaptation results. Such constraints are often available in the form of instance correspondences, e.g. when the same object or individual is observed simultaneously from multiple views, or tracked between video frames. In these cases, the object labels are unknown but can be constrained to be the same or similar. We propose techniques that build on existing domain adaptation methods by explicitly modeling these relationships, and demonstrate empirically that they improve recognition accuracy in two scenarios, multicategory image classification and object detection in video.</p><p>3 0.14748666 <a title="98-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Adaptive_Active_Learning_for_Image_Classification.html">34 cvpr-2013-Adaptive Active Learning for Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Xin Li, Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Recently active learning has attracted a lot of attention in computer vision field, as it is time and cost consuming to prepare a good set of labeled images for vision data analysis. Most existing active learning approaches employed in computer vision adopt most uncertainty measures as instance selection criteria. Although most uncertainty query selection strategies are very effective in many circumstances, they fail to take information in the large amount of unlabeled instances into account and are prone to querying outliers. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive active learning approach that combines an information density measure and a most uncertainty measure together to select critical instances to label for image classifications. Our experiments on two essential tasks of computer vision, object recognition and scene recognition, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p><p>4 0.14288318 <a title="98-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Event_Recognition_in_Videos_by_Learning_from_Heterogeneous_Web_Sources.html">150 cvpr-2013-Event Recognition in Videos by Learning from Heterogeneous Web Sources</a></p>
<p>Author: Lin Chen, Lixin Duan, Dong Xu</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we propose to leverage a large number of loosely labeled web videos (e.g., from YouTube) and web images (e.g., from Google/Bing image search) for visual event recognition in consumer videos without requiring any labeled consumer videos. We formulate this task as a new multi-domain adaptation problem with heterogeneous sources, in which the samples from different source domains can be represented by different types of features with different dimensions (e.g., the SIFTfeaturesfrom web images and space-time (ST) features from web videos) while the target domain samples have all types of features. To effectively cope with the heterogeneous sources where some source domains are more relevant to the target domain, we propose a new method called Multi-domain Adaptation with Heterogeneous Sources (MDA-HS) to learn an optimal target classifier, in which we simultaneously seek the optimal weights for different source domains with different types of features as well as infer the labels of unlabeled target domain data based on multiple types of features. We solve our optimization problem by using the cutting-plane algorithm based on group-based multiple kernel learning. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MDA-HS for event recognition in consumer videos.</p><p>5 0.13632807 <a title="98-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Adding_Unlabeled_Samples_to_Categories_by_Learned_Attributes.html">36 cvpr-2013-Adding Unlabeled Samples to Categories by Learned Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonghyun Choi, Mohammad Rastegari, Ali Farhadi, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to expand the visual coverage of training sets that consist of a small number of labeled examples using learned attributes. Our optimization formulation discovers category specific attributes as well as the images that have high confidence in terms of the attributes. In addition, we propose a method to stably capture example-specific attributes for a small sized training set. Our method adds images to a category from a large unlabeled image pool, and leads to significant improvement in category recognition accuracy evaluated on a large-scale dataset, ImageNet.</p><p>6 0.12565659 <a title="98-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Subspace_Interpolation_via_Dictionary_Learning_for_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation.html">419 cvpr-2013-Subspace Interpolation via Dictionary Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ilja Kuzborskij, Francesco Orabona, Barbara Caputo</p><p>Abstract: Since the seminal work of Thrun [17], the learning to learnparadigm has been defined as the ability ofan agent to improve its performance at each task with experience, with the number of tasks. Within the object categorization domain, the visual learning community has actively declined this paradigm in the transfer learning setting. Almost all proposed methods focus on category detection problems, addressing how to learn a new target class from few samples by leveraging over the known source. But if one thinks oflearning over multiple tasks, there is a needfor multiclass transfer learning algorithms able to exploit previous source knowledge when learning a new class, while at the same time optimizing their overall performance. This is an open challenge for existing transfer learning algorithms. The contribution of this paper is a discriminative method that addresses this issue, based on a Least-Squares Support Vector Machine formulation. Our approach is designed to balance between transferring to the new class and preserving what has already been learned on the source models. Exten- sive experiments on subsets of publicly available datasets prove the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>5 0.72560161 <a title="98-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Subspace_Interpolation_via_Dictionary_Learning_for_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation.html">419 cvpr-2013-Subspace Interpolation via Dictionary Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jie Ni, Qiang Qiu, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation addresses the problem where data instances of a source domain have different distributions from that of a target domain, which occurs frequently in many real life scenarios. This work focuses on unsupervised domain adaptation, where labeled data are only available in the source domain. We propose to interpolate subspaces through dictionary learning to link the source and target domains. These subspaces are able to capture the intrinsic domain shift and form a shared feature representation for cross domain recognition. Further, we introduce a quantitative measure to characterize the shift between two domains, which enables us to select the optimal domain to adapt to the given multiple source domains. We present exumd .edu , rama@umiacs .umd .edu training and testing data are captured from the same underlying distribution. Yet this assumption is often violated in many real life applications. For instance, images collected from an internet search engine are compared with those captured from real life [28, 4]. Face recognition systems trained on frontal and high resolution images, are applied to probe images with non-frontal poses and low resolution [6]. Human actions are recognized from an unseen target view using training data taken from source views [21, 20]. We show some examples of dataset shifts in Figure 1. In these scenarios, magnitudes of variations of innate characteristics, which distinguish one class from another, are oftentimes smaller than the variations caused by distribution shift between training and testing dataset. Directly applying the classifier from the training set to testing set periments on face recognition across pose, illumination and blur variations, cross dataset object recognition, and report improved performance over the state of the art.</p><p>6 0.67245644 <a title="98-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Adaptive_Active_Learning_for_Image_Classification.html">34 cvpr-2013-Adaptive Active Learning for Image Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Samuele Salti, Alessandro Lanza, Luigi Di_Stefano</p><p>Abstract: The paper conjectures and demonstrates that repeatable keypoints based on salient symmetries at different scales can be detected by a novel analysis grounded on the wave equation rather than the heat equation underlying traditional Gaussian scale–space theory. While the image structures found by most state-of-the-art detectors, such as blobs and corners, occur typically on planar highly textured surfaces, salient symmetries are widespread in diverse kinds of images, including those related to untextured objects, which are hardly dealt with by current feature-based recognition pipelines. We provide experimental results on standard datasets and also contribute with a new dataset focused on untextured objects. Based on the positive experimental results, we hope to foster further research on the promising topic ofscale invariant analysis through the wave equation.</p><p>2 0.82068956 <a title="98-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Graph-Based_Optimization_with_Tubularity_Markov_Tree_for_3D_Vessel_Segmentation.html">190 cvpr-2013-Graph-Based Optimization with Tubularity Markov Tree for 3D Vessel Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ning Zhu, Albert C.S. Chung</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for 3D vessel tree structure segmentation based on a new tubularity Markov tree model ( TMT), which works as both new energy function and graph construction method. With the help of power-watershed implementation [7], a global optimal segmentation can be obtained with low computational cost. Different with other graph-based vessel segmentation methods, the proposed method does not depend on any skeleton and ROI extraction method. The classical issues of the graph-based methods, such as shrinking bias and sensitivity to seed point location, can be solved with the proposed method thanks to vessel data fidelity obtained with TMT. The proposed method is compared with some classical graph-based image segmentation methods and two up-to-date 3D vessel segmentation methods, and is demonstrated to be more accurate than these methods for 3D vessel tree segmentation. Although the segmentation is done without ROI extraction, the computational cost for the proposed method is low (within 20 seconds for 256*256*144 image).</p><p>3 0.81167358 <a title="98-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Shading-Based_Shape_Refinement_of_RGB-D_Images.html">394 cvpr-2013-Shading-Based Shape Refinement of RGB-D Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Lap-Fai Yu, Sai-Kit Yeung, Yu-Wing Tai, Stephen Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present a shading-based shape refinement algorithm which uses a noisy, incomplete depth map from Kinect to help resolve ambiguities in shape-from-shading. In our framework, the partial depth information is used to overcome bas-relief ambiguity in normals estimation, as well as to assist in recovering relative albedos, which are needed to reliably estimate the lighting environment and to separate shading from albedo. This refinement of surface normals using a noisy depth map leads to high-quality 3D surfaces. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through several challenging real-world examples.</p><p>4 0.78109086 <a title="98-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Voxel_Cloud_Connectivity_Segmentation_-_Supervoxels_for_Point_Clouds.html">458 cvpr-2013-Voxel Cloud Connectivity Segmentation - Supervoxels for Point Clouds</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeremie Papon, Alexey Abramov, Markus Schoeler, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised over-segmentation of an image into regions of perceptually similar pixels, known as superpixels, is a widely used preprocessing step in segmentation algorithms. Superpixel methods reduce the number of regions that must be considered later by more computationally expensive algorithms, with a minimal loss of information. Nevertheless, as some information is inevitably lost, it is vital that superpixels not cross object boundaries, as such errors will propagate through later steps. Existing methods make use of projected color or depth information, but do not consider three dimensional geometric relationships between observed data points which can be used to prevent superpixels from crossing regions of empty space. We propose a novel over-segmentation algorithm which uses voxel relationships to produce over-segmentations which are fully consistent with the spatial geometry of the scene in three dimensional, rather than projective, space. Enforcing the constraint that segmented regions must have spatial connectivity prevents label flow across semantic object boundaries which might otherwise be violated. Additionally, as the algorithm works directly in 3D space, observations from several calibrated RGB+D cameras can be segmented jointly. Experiments on a large data set of human annotated RGB+D images demonstrate a significant reduction in occurrence of clusters crossing object boundaries, while maintaining speeds comparable to state-of-the-art 2D methods.</p><p>5 0.77216733 <a title="98-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-parametric_Filtering_for_Geometric_Detail_Extraction_and_Material_Representation.html">305 cvpr-2013-Non-parametric Filtering for Geometric Detail Extraction and Material Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zicheng Liao, Jason Rock, Yang Wang, David Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: Geometric detail is a universal phenomenon in real world objects. It is an important component in object modeling, but not accounted for in current intrinsic image works. In this work, we explore using a non-parametric method to separate geometric detail from intrinsic image components. We further decompose an image as albedo ∗ (ccoomarpsoen-escnatsle. shading +e shading pdoestaeil a).n Oaugre decomposition offers quantitative improvement in albedo recovery and material classification.Our method also enables interesting image editing activities, including bump removal, geometric detail smoothing/enhancement and material transfer.</p><p>6 0.74437195 <a title="98-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Bayesian_Depth-from-Defocus_with_Shading_Constraints.html">56 cvpr-2013-Bayesian Depth-from-Defocus with Shading Constraints</a></p>

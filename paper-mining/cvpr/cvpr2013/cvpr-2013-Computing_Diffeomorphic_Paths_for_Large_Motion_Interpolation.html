</p><p>10 Introduction Image and shape matching using 2D diffeomorphisms (diffeomorphic matching) is a popular technique in many computer vision and medical imaging applications such as ∗This research was in part supported by the NIH grant NS066340 to BCV Jeffrey Ho  Baba C. [sent-13, score-0.496]
</p><p>11 Recall that a diffeomorphism is a smooth bijective mapping between two (image) domains, and many important types of transformations and deformations used in computer vision can be taken as 2D/3D diffeomorphisms between appropriate domains. [sent-17, score-0.671]
</p><p>12 A computational problem that has a fundamental importance in diffeomorphic matching is to determine a smooth path of diffeomorphisms that connects/interpolates a given pair of diffeomorphisms. [sent-18, score-1.043]
</p><p>13 Given two diffeomorphisms ρ0, ρ1, a smooth path Ωin → → DifΩ f(. [sent-20, score-0.67]
</p><p>14 ) ∈ Diff(Ω) is a diffeomorphism oanr dea φc(h0 t, . [sent-22, score-0.153]
</p><p>15 ΩIn) itsh ias paper, we present a novel framework for computing such a smooth path for a given pair of diffeomorphisms ρ0 and ρ1 . [sent-26, score-0.67]
</p><p>16 However, evaluating diffeomorphic path between two given diffeomorphisms is a challenging problem. [sent-27, score-1.043]
</p><p>17 This is mainly due to first, the infinite dimensionality of the space of diffeomorphisms and second, the lack of knowledge of the metric on this space. [sent-28, score-0.574]
</p><p>18 However, in this  framework (applied to image registration), the diffeomorphic path φ is not explicitly computed; instead, a timedependent vector field v(t, . [sent-30, score-0.547]
</p><p>19 )||2L2, (1) where I1, I2 are the two input images, and the diffeomorphic path φ is obtained by integrating the time-dependent 1 1 12 2 2 2 2 57 5  vector field v via the following ODE  ddtφ(t,. [sent-34, score-0.547]
</p><p>20 [2] have shown that the diffeomorphic paths determined by LDDMM stay in the space of diffeomorphisms. [sent-38, score-0.435]
</p><p>21 The LDDMM framework has been further elaborated in the context of evolution equations on groups of diffeomorphisms and momentum conservation [3]. [sent-39, score-0.548]
</p><p>22 introduced geodesic equations on the group of diffeomorphisms based on the LDDMM in [3] and Sommer et al. [sent-41, score-0.628]
</p><p>23 These frameworks involve two different optimizations: image matching and smoothing of the diffeomorphic paths in the space of diffeomorphisms. [sent-44, score-0.452]
</p><p>24 Second, the smoothness constraint over a diffeomorphic path may lead to unsatisfactory correspondences between input images. [sent-49, score-0.547]
</p><p>25 One way to overcome these issues is to separate registration stage and the stage of estimating diffeomorphic paths. [sent-51, score-0.414]
</p><p>26 The key contribution in this paper is that we design a framework for interpolating the two given differomorphisms, which is formulated separately from the registration task. [sent-52, score-0.093]
</p><p>27 Instead of interpolating the diffeomorphisms in their space directly, we project diffeomorphisms on to the space of densities, whose geodesics are readily computed, and then lift the geodesics back to the space of diffeomorphisms efficiently. [sent-53, score-1.839]
</p><p>28 More specifically, let M denote a compact ndimensional Riemannian manifold, and Diff(M) and Diffμ (M) respectively denote the infinite-dimensional group ofdiffeomorphisms of M and its infinite-dimensional subgroup of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. [sent-54, score-0.076]
</p><p>29 The quotient space Diff(M)/Diff(M)μ was studied in depth and  identified with the space of densities functions Dens(M) on M in [6]. [sent-55, score-0.193]
</p><p>30 The latter space can then be canonically embedded into a sphere in the Hilbert space (See [6] for details); therefore, the geodesics on Dens(M) can be computed readily. [sent-56, score-0.239]
</p><p>31 In LDDMM, the diffeomorphic path is computed directly in Diff(M) without referencing the quotient space Dens(M) = Diff(M)/Diff(M)μ. [sent-57, score-0.7]
</p><p>32 Third row: the path of images warped by the diffeomorphisms along the path estimated using our method. [sent-60, score-0.844]
</p><p>33 We remark that it is precisely because the geometry of the quotient space is available (and simple), the geodesic path can first be determined on the quotient space. [sent-63, score-0.544]
</p><p>34 The second step of lifting the path in Dens(M) back to Diff(M) is then formulated as a quadratic programming problem with bilinear constraints that minimizes point-wise L2-norm of deformation fields along the diffeomorphic path. [sent-64, score-0.82]
</p><p>35 We validate the proposed framework by applying it to the problem of filling-in missing frames in a video footage. [sent-68, score-0.145]
</p><p>36 Model formulation In this section, we present the novel framework for computing the path of diffeomorphisms. [sent-71, score-0.174]
</p><p>37 The estimation of geodesics on the space of diffeomorphisms requires the knowledge of its metric. [sent-73, score-0.594]
</p><p>38 However, in this paper, instead of working on the manifold of diffeomorphisms whose metric is unknown, we map diffeomorphisms to a known space, the space of densities, and take advantage of the fact that geodesics for the canonical metric on the sphere are the great circles. [sent-74, score-1.245]
</p><p>39 Our algorithm consists of the following two steps: 1 1 12 2 2 2 2 68 6  •  •  Map a given pair of diffeomorphisms to the space of dMenapsit aie gs,iv eD nen psa(irM o)f adnifdf computing tsh teo geodesic e b oe-f tween the two projected points. [sent-75, score-0.644]
</p><p>40 The Space of Densities and Diffeomorphisms Given a pair of diffeomorphisms mapping Ω to Ω, and without loss of generality, we can assume one of them is the identity map id and denote the other diffeomorphism by ρ. [sent-79, score-0.746]
</p><p>41 The goal is to compute the one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms, φ(t), between id and ρ, such that φ(0) = id and φ(t = tf) = ρ where, 0 ≤ t ≤ tf. [sent-80, score-0.116]
</p><p>42 Furthermore, since φ is a diffeomorphism of M, the integral transform  μ(M) =? [sent-83, score-0.153]
</p><p>43 =The Jreafocre, using the squareroot of the density function, we can define the map Φ from Diff(M) to a sphere in a Hilbert space via Φ : φ → f = ? [sent-91, score-0.122]
</p><p>44 MΦ2(φ)dμ = μ(M)  (4)  since  shows that Φ(φ) belongs to a sphere with radius ? [sent-93, score-0.097]
</p><p>45 int on the unit sphere and for the two diffeomorphism id, ρ mapped on  to the sphere by Φ, the unique geodesic between them can be readily computed using the formula  f(t) =sin1(θ)[sin(θ − t)f1+ sin(t)f2]  (5)  where f1 = ? [sent-96, score-0.492]
</p><p>46 id are projected to the same point on the sphere. [sent-104, score-0.077]
</p><p>47 Hence, the geodesic joining the two projected points is degenerate – i. [sent-105, score-0.157]
</p><p>48 , it consists of just one point– and the lifted diffeomorphic path in Diff(M) is then a path joining ρ and id consisting of only volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. [sent-107, score-0.839]
</p><p>49 In this paper, diffeomorphisms are expressed as deformation vector fields. [sent-108, score-0.583]
</p><p>50 In the case of 2-D, φ(t) = (x + U(r, t) , y + V (r, t)) where r = (x, y), and (U(r, t) , V (r, t)) denote the deformation vector fields. [sent-109, score-0.104]
</p><p>51 Lifting the Geodesic Path to the Space of Diffeomorphisms After a geodesic on the sphere is obtained, we have to lift this path back to Diff(M). [sent-118, score-0.454]
</p><p>52 This is because the equation is bilinear , and geometrically, this corresponds to the fact that Eq. [sent-121, score-0.064]
</p><p>53 Therefore, the computation ofthe lifted path must be regularized, and we propose using the L2 smoothness ofthe deformation vector fields over time as the main regularization criterion. [sent-123, score-0.314]
</p><p>54 The lifting problem now leads to a quadratic program with bilinear constraints for 2D domains  min? [sent-125, score-0.136]
</p><p>55 In our numerical scheme, we consider it as the change in area of a triangle in the mesh with four neighboring pixel points replaced by the deformation field at vertices. [sent-195, score-0.106]
</p><p>56 After vectorizing all deformation vector fields, the optimization problem becomes a quadratic program with bilinear constraints given by:  min21U? [sent-204, score-0.177]
</p><p>57 Du(V)U ( Dv (U)V) corresponds to the bilinear terms in Eq. [sent-227, score-0.064]
</p><p>58 Experimental Results We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework using the difficult problem image interpolation for missing frames in videos. [sent-254, score-0.153]
</p><p>59 Specifically, for the experiment, an image sequence is extracted from a video and a few frames are selected as the key frames. [sent-255, score-0.161]
</p><p>60 We then apply our method to compute a diffeomorphic path connecting two adjacent key frames, and the intermediate frames are computed and warped by the appropriate diffeomorphism along the diffeomorphic path. [sent-256, score-1.197]
</p><p>61 These filled-in im-  age sequences are compared with the original sequences by measuring the pSNR of the computed frames w. [sent-257, score-0.149]
</p><p>62 Second, a registration map– or diffeomorphism denoted by ρ–between the two images is computed using an image registration method. [sent-263, score-0.254]
</p><p>63 We then set id as the diffeomorphism which maps the source image to itself, and in this way, we have the two diffeomorphisms to be interpolated, id and ρ. [sent-264, score-0.765]
</p><p>64 Next, we compute a diffeomorphic path, φ(t) joining id and ρ, using the proposed algorithm. [sent-265, score-0.465]
</p><p>65 Finally, with this computed diffeomorphic path φ(t), we can simulate an image sequence I(t) between Is and It simply by warping the image I(t) = Is ◦ φ(t). [sent-266, score-0.604]
</p><p>66 We have two cylinders: one is positioned upright and the other one is the 50-degree-rotated version of the upright cylinder. [sent-269, score-0.082]
</p><p>67 We evaluate deformation fields that deform the upright cylinder to the rotated one keeping the boundary fixed. [sent-270, score-0.19]
</p><p>68 The ground truth is generated by rotating the upright cylinder by 50/19 degree consecutively so that we have 20 sequential images. [sent-272, score-0.094]

</p><p>77 3, the two groups of missing frames in each sequence are highlighted with rectangular boxes, with the three remaining key frames. [sent-301, score-0.213]
</p><p>78 Next we compute two diffeomorphic deformation fields: one from the first to the the seventeenth frame, and  one from the seventeenth frame to the last frame. [sent-302, score-0.594]
</p><p>79 The missing frames are computed as described in the previous section. [sent-303, score-0.146]
</p><p>80 The resulting frames are compared with the ground truth and also with results produced by LDDMM: visual comparison shown in in Fig. [sent-304, score-0.082]
</p><p>81 Additionally, LDDMM requires more key frames (between the first and seventeenth frames) in order to ensure its convergence. [sent-311, score-0.172]
</p><p>82 Dancing motion sequence In this experiment, we work on a video sequence with a more complicated motion namely, dancing. [sent-314, score-0.144]
</p><p>83 Twenty-seven image frames have been sampled from the original video, and twenty-two frames have been removed, leaving five key frames. [sent-315, score-0.187]
</p><p>84 These keyframes and missing frames are shown in Fig. [sent-316, score-0.148]
</p><p>85 Due the amount of motion variation, we have retained more key frames (five) than the previous experiment on bending motion (three). [sent-318, score-0.234]
</p><p>86 We compute the same number of missing frames using our method as in the previous experiment. [sent-319, score-0.127]
</p><p>87 We remark that for this experiment we  were not able to find suitable parameters for LDDMM to produce convergent results. [sent-324, score-0.068]
</p><p>88 Conclusion In this paper, we have introduced a novel framework for computing a diffeomorphic path that interpolates the two given diffeomorphisms, and we have demonstrated its applicability to image interpolation problems for reconstructing missing or corrupted images in videos. [sent-326, score-0.618]
</p><p>89 Computing diffeomorphic paths is often challenging, and the difficulty mainly arises from the nonlinearity and the infinite dimensionality of the space. [sent-327, score-0.434]
</p><p>90 However, some of these difficulties can be circumvented by appealing to the fact that the quotient space of Diff(M) by (the subgroup of) volume-preserving diffeomorphisms can be identified with a convex subset ofthe unit sphere in a Hilbert space. [sent-329, score-0.787]
</p><p>91 Using this decomposition (loosely speaking), the geometry of the sphere, which is well-known and computationally straightforward, provides us with geodesics that can be readily computed. [sent-330, score-0.095]
</p><p>92 In particular, for the problems that requires treating the volume-preserving diffeomorphisms as the nuisance parameters, the path computed by our method is exactly the geodesic paths for the problems. [sent-331, score-0.83]

<p>Author: Dohyung Seo, Jeffrey Ho, Baba C. Vemuri</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for computing a path of diffeomorphisms between a pair of input diffeomorphisms. Direct computation of a geodesic path on the space of diffeomorphisms Diff(Ω) is difficult, and it can be attributed mainly to the infinite dimensionality of Diff(Ω). Our proposed framework, to some degree, bypasses this difficulty using the quotient map of Diff(Ω) to the quotient space Diff(M)/Diff(M)μ obtained by quotienting out the subgroup of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms Diff(M)μ. This quotient space was recently identified as the unit sphere in a Hilbert space in mathematics literature, a space with well-known geometric properties. Our framework leverages this recent result by computing the diffeomorphic path in two stages. First, we project the given diffeomorphism pair onto this sphere and then compute the geodesic path between these projected points. Sec- ond, we lift the geodesic on the sphere back to the space of diffeomerphisms, by solving a quadratic programming problem with bilinear constraints using the augmented Lagrangian technique with penalty terms. In this way, we can estimate the path of diffeomorphisms, first, staying in the space of diffeomorphisms, and second, preserving shapes/volumes in the deformed images along the path as much as possible. We have applied our framework to interpolate intermediate frames of frame-sub-sampled video sequences.

<p>Author: Rui Caseiro, Pedro Martins, João F. Henriques, Fátima Silva Leite, Jorge Batista</p><p>Abstract: In the past few years there has been a growing interest on geometric frameworks to learn supervised classification models on Riemannian manifolds [31, 27]. A popular framework, valid over any Riemannian manifold, was proposed in [31] for binary classification. Once moving from binary to multi-class classification thisparadigm is not valid anymore, due to the spread of multiple positive classes on the manifold [27]. It is then natural to ask whether the multi-class paradigm could be extended to operate on a large class of Riemannian manifolds. We propose a mathematically well-founded classification paradigm that allows to extend the work in [31] to multi-class models, taking into account the structure of the space. The idea is to project all the data from the manifold onto an affine tangent space at a particular point. To mitigate the distortion induced by local diffeomorphisms, we introduce for the first time in the computer vision community a well-founded mathematical concept, so-called Rolling map [21, 16]. The novelty in this alternate school of thought is that the manifold will be firstly rolled (without slipping or twisting) as a rigid body, then the given data is unwrapped onto the affine tangent space, where the classification is performed.</p><p>3 0.099835888 <a title="90-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic_Harmonic_Mapping_for_Constrained_Brain_Surface_Registration.html">208 cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic Harmonic Mapping for Constrained Brain Surface Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Shi, Wei Zeng, Zhengyu Su, Hanna Damasio, Zhonglin Lu, Yalin Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is an active research field in computer vision, computer graphics and computational geometry. It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquer this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric, so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on the Ricci flow method and the method is general and robust. We apply our algorithm to study constrained human brain surface registration problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic, and achieve relative high performance when evaluated with some popular cortical surface registration evaluation standards.</p><p>4 0.096394159 <a title="90-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Correspondence-Less_Non-rigid_Registration_of_Triangular_Surface_Meshes.html">97 cvpr-2013-Correspondence-Less Non-rigid Registration of Triangular Surface Meshes</a></p>

<p>Author: Shihui Ying, Guorong Wu, Qian Wang, Dinggang Shen</p><p>Abstract: Recently, groupwise registration has been investigated for simultaneous alignment of all images without selecting any individual image as the template, thus avoiding the potential bias in image registration. However, none of current groupwise registration method fully utilizes the image distribution to guide the registration. Thus, the registration performance usually suffers from large inter-subject variations across individual images. To solve this issue, we propose a novel groupwise registration algorithm for large population dataset, guided by the image distribution on the manifold. Specifically, we first use a graph to model the distribution of all image data sitting on the image manifold, with each node representing an image and each edge representing the geodesic pathway between two nodes (or images). Then, the procedure of warping all images to theirpopulation center turns to the dynamic shrinking ofthe graph nodes along their graph edges until all graph nodes become close to each other. Thus, the topology ofimage distribution on the image manifold is always preserved during the groupwise registration. More importantly, by modeling , the distribution of all images via a graph, we can potentially reduce registration error since every time each image is warped only according to its nearby images with similar structures in the graph. We have evaluated our proposed groupwise registration method on both synthetic and real datasets, with comparison to the two state-of-the-art groupwise registration methods. All experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of registration accuracy and robustness.</p><p>6 0.063894153 <a title="90-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Templateless_Quasi-rigid_Shape_Modeling_with_Implicit_Loop-Closure.html">424 cvpr-2013-Templateless Quasi-rigid Shape Modeling with Implicit Loop-Closure</a></p>

<p>Author: Dohyung Seo, Jeffrey Ho, Baba C. Vemuri</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for computing a path of diffeomorphisms between a pair of input diffeomorphisms. Direct computation of a geodesic path on the space of diffeomorphisms Diff(Ω) is difficult, and it can be attributed mainly to the infinite dimensionality of Diff(Ω). Our proposed framework, to some degree, bypasses this difficulty using the quotient map of Diff(Ω) to the quotient space Diff(M)/Diff(M)μ obtained by quotienting out the subgroup of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms Diff(M)μ. This quotient space was recently identified as the unit sphere in a Hilbert space in mathematics literature, a space with well-known geometric properties. Our framework leverages this recent result by computing the diffeomorphic path in two stages. First, we project the given diffeomorphism pair onto this sphere and then compute the geodesic path between these projected points. Sec- ond, we lift the geodesic on the sphere back to the space of diffeomerphisms, by solving a quadratic programming problem with bilinear constraints using the augmented Lagrangian technique with penalty terms. In this way, we can estimate the path of diffeomorphisms, first, staying in the space of diffeomorphisms, and second, preserving shapes/volumes in the deformed images along the path as much as possible. We have applied our framework to interpolate intermediate frames of frame-sub-sampled video sequences. In the reported experiments, our approach compares favorably with the popular Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping framework (LDDMM).</p><p>2 0.72264761 <a title="90-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic_Harmonic_Mapping_for_Constrained_Brain_Surface_Registration.html">208 cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic Harmonic Mapping for Constrained Brain Surface Registration</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhengyu Su, Wei Zeng, Rui Shi, Yalin Wang, Jian Sun, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Brain mapping transforms the brain cortical surface to canonical planar domains, which plays a fundamental role in morphological study. Most existing brain mapping methods are based on angle preserving maps, which may introduce large area distortions. This work proposes an area preserving brain mapping method based on MongeBrenier theory. The brain mapping is intrinsic to the Riemannian metric, unique, and diffeomorphic. The computation is equivalent to convex energy minimization and power Voronoi diagram construction. Comparing to the existing approaches based on Monge-Kantorovich theory, the proposed one greatly reduces the complexity (from n2 unknowns to n ), and improves the simplicity and efficiency. Experimental results on caudate nucleus surface mapping and cortical surface mapping demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method. Conventional methods for caudate nucleus surface mapping may suffer from numerical instability; in contrast, current method produces diffeomorpic mappings stably. In the study of cortical sur- face classification for recognition of Alzheimer’s Disease, the proposed method outperforms some other morphometry features.</p><p>5 0.65388805 <a title="90-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Correspondence-Less_Non-rigid_Registration_of_Triangular_Surface_Meshes.html">97 cvpr-2013-Correspondence-Less Non-rigid Registration of Triangular Surface Meshes</a></p>

<p>Author: Haichao Zhang, David Wipf, Yanning Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a robust algorithm for estimating a single latent sharp image given multiple blurry and/or noisy observations. The underlying multi-image blind deconvolution problem is solved by linking all of the observations together via a Bayesian-inspired penalty function which couples the unknown latent image, blur kernels, and noise levels together in a unique way. This coupled penalty function enjoys a number of desirable properties, including a mechanism whereby the relative-concavity or shape is adapted as a function of the intrinsic quality of each blurry observation. In this way, higher quality observations may automatically contribute more to the final estimate than heavily degraded ones. The resulting algorithm, which requires no essential tuning parameters, can recover a high quality image from a set of observations containing potentially both blurry and noisy examples, without knowing a priorithe degradation type of each observation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world test images clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</p><p>2 0.87214094 <a title="90-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-uniform_Motion_Deblurring_for_Bilayer_Scenes.html">307 cvpr-2013-Non-uniform Motion Deblurring for Bilayer Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Chandramouli Paramanand, Ambasamudram N. Rajagopalan</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the latent image of a static bilayer scene (consisting of a foreground and a background at different depths) from motion blurred observations captured with a handheld camera. The camera motion is considered to be composed of in-plane rotations and translations. Since the blur at an image location depends both on camera motion and depth, deblurring becomes a difficult task. We initially propose a method to estimate the transformation spread function (TSF) corresponding to one of the depth layers. The estimated TSF (which reveals the camera motion during exposure) is used to segment the scene into the foreground and background layers and determine the relative depth value. The deblurred image of the scene is finally estimated within a regularization framework by accounting for blur variations due to camera motion as well as depth.</p><p>3 0.86698973 <a title="90-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Explicit_Occlusion_Modeling_for_3D_Object_Class_Representations.html">154 cvpr-2013-Explicit Occlusion Modeling for 3D Object Class Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: M. Zeeshan Zia, Michael Stark, Konrad Schindler</p><p>Abstract: Despite the success of current state-of-the-art object class detectors, severe occlusion remains a major challenge. This is particularly true for more geometrically expressive 3D object class representations. While these representations have attracted renewed interest for precise object pose estimation, the focus has mostly been on rather clean datasets, where occlusion is not an issue. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of modeling occlusion in the context of a 3D geometric object class model that is capable of fine-grained, part-level 3D object reconstruction. Following the intuition that 3D modeling should facilitate occlusion reasoning, we design an explicit representation of likely geometric occlusion patterns. Robustness is achieved by pooling image evidence from of a set of fixed part detectors as well as a non-parametric representation of part configurations in the spirit of poselets. We confirm the potential of our method on cars in a newly collected data set of inner-city street scenes with varying levels of occlusion, and demonstrate superior performance in occlusion estimation and part localization, compared to baselines that are unaware of occlusions.</p><p>4 0.85904062 <a title="90-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Can_a_Fully_Unconstrained_Imaging_Model_Be_Applied_Effectively_to_Central_Cameras%3F.html">76 cvpr-2013-Can a Fully Unconstrained Imaging Model Be Applied Effectively to Central Cameras?</a></p>
<p>Author: Filippo Bergamasco, Andrea Albarelli, Emanuele Rodolà, Andrea Torsello</p><p>Abstract: Traditional camera models are often the result of a compromise between the ability to account for non-linearities in the image formation model and the need for a feasible number of degrees of freedom in the estimation process. These considerations led to the definition of several ad hoc models that best adapt to different imaging devices, ranging from pinhole cameras with no radial distortion to the more complex catadioptric or polydioptric optics. In this paper we dai s .unive . it ence points in the scene with their projections on the image plane [5]. Unfortunately, no real camera behaves exactly like an ideal pinhole. In fact, in most cases, at least the distortion effects introduced by the lens should be accounted for [19]. Any pinhole-based model, regardless of its level of sophistication, is geometrically unable to properly describe cameras exhibiting a frustum angle that is near or above 180 degrees. For wide-angle cameras, several different para- metric models have been proposed. Some of them try to modify the captured image in order to follow the original propose the use of an unconstrained model even in standard central camera settings dominated by the pinhole model, and introduce a novel calibration approach that can deal effectively with the huge number of free parameters associated with it, resulting in a higher precision calibration than what is possible with the standard pinhole model with correction for radial distortion. This effectively extends the use of general models to settings that traditionally have been ruled by parametric approaches out of practical considerations. The benefit of such an unconstrained model to quasipinhole central cameras is supported by an extensive experimental validation.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.85272217 <a title="90-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Computing_Diffeomorphic_Paths_for_Large_Motion_Interpolation.html">90 cvpr-2013-Computing Diffeomorphic Paths for Large Motion Interpolation</a></p>

This quotient space was recently identified as the unit sphere in a Hilbert space in mathematics literature, a space with well-known geometric properties. Our framework leverages this recent result by computing the diffeomorphic path in two stages. First, we project the given diffeomorphism pair onto this sphere and then compute the geodesic path between these projected points. Sec- ond, we lift the geodesic on the sphere back to the space of diffeomerphisms, by solving a quadratic programming problem with bilinear constraints using the augmented Lagrangian technique with penalty terms. In this way, we can estimate the path of diffeomorphisms, first, staying in the space of diffeomorphisms, and second, preserving shapes/volumes in the deformed images along the path as much as possible. We have applied our framework to interpolate intermediate frames of frame-sub-sampled video sequences. In the reported experiments, our approach compares favorably with the popular Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping framework (LDDMM).</p><p>6 0.83547062 <a title="90-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Self-Paced_Learning_for_Long-Term_Tracking.html">386 cvpr-2013-Self-Paced Learning for Long-Term Tracking</a></p>

</p><p>6 We evaluate our approach on a public dataset of 25 landmarks and our new dataset of 620 landmarks (614K images). [sent-13, score-0.274]
</p><p>7 Our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art in landmark classification. [sent-14, score-0.251]
</p><p>8 Introduction Given a pre-defined set of locations and landmarks, we address the problem of recognizing the landmark (or location) from a single image. [sent-17, score-0.251]
</p><p>9 The main challenge in landmark recognition arises from the great diversity of camera viewpoints as well as variations in scale and appearance due to illumination changes from time-of-day, weather, seasons etc. [sent-20, score-0.251]
</p><p>10 Broadly speaking, most existing methods for landmark classification build upon scalable image retrieval techniques [28, 22, 13, 3, 26, 12]. [sent-23, score-0.402]
</p><p>11 Large-scale and finegrained classification has recently gained interest amongst researchers, however, with the exception of [16, 8], we are not aware of much work focusing on landmark or location classification within this framework. [sent-30, score-0.337]
</p><p>12 In this paper, we pose landmark recognition as a categorization task, by treating each landmark as a class. [sent-31, score-0.537]
</p><p>13 Within this setting, our objective is to learn a compact, discriminative codebook from training data and use it with existing feature encoding schemes and some variants that we propose. [sent-33, score-0.663]
</p><p>14 We propose to exploit such feature correspondences in the training data to learn a compact codebook that maps matching descriptors into the same code. [sent-43, score-0.641]
</p><p>15 Large codebooks learned in an unsupervised setting can also be discriminative [22, 26], but they are only suitable for large-scale image retrieval [22, 26, 20]. [sent-44, score-0.423]
</p><p>16 In classification tasks, compact  codebooks provide computational efficiency, as larger codebooks typically increase the dimensionality of feature vectors used by the classifiers. [sent-45, score-0.703]
</p><p>17 Our codebook is expressed by a random forest that we learn in a supervised fashion, using the training descriptors and their fine-grained track labels. [sent-48, score-0.756]
</p><p>18 We use the codebook as a tree quantizer for bag of words histogram encoding and also with other advanced schemes [13]. [sent-49, score-0.756]
</p><p>19 The supervised training of the codebook using track labels reduces quantization error on these repeatable and discriminative features. [sent-50, score-0.582]
</p><p>20 Unlike prior discriminative methods to codebook learning [21, 15] which use descriptors labeled by landmark categories, our descriptors have fine-grained labels. [sent-51, score-0.888]
</p><p>21 This is beneficial as it forces the codebook learning method to predict the same label only for descriptors that truly correspond to the same physical scene point. [sent-52, score-0.481]
</p><p>22 However, this also implies that we must train a codebook with 3–4 orders of magnitude more labels (∼ 105). [sent-53, score-0.444]
</p><p>23 To address this issue, we propose dtoe mleoarrne tahbee lcso (d∼ebo 1o0k using a random forest [5] which is efficient to train and it enables fast quantization. [sent-54, score-0.214]
</p><p>24 In order to help dealing with the large number of class labels we exploit two ideas: (1) we adopt the splitting rule used in random projection trees [7] originally proposed for unsupervised tasks, and (2) we use an improved information  gain estimator proposed in [23] to select the best split. [sent-55, score-0.258]
</p><p>25 We evaluate our approach on a public landmark dataset from [11], and our own dataset of 620 landmarks (614K images). [sent-56, score-0.388]
</p><p>26 [16] treated landmarks as visual categories and proposed a generic image classification pipeline [6, 24] based on Kmeans codebooks and bag of words encoding used with multi-class SVMs. [sent-62, score-0.679]
</p><p>27 An improved similarity measures to compare bag of words histograms is proposed for image retrieval with very large codebooks in [20]. [sent-67, score-0.424]
</p><p>28 Better aggregation techniques such as VLAD [13] was shown to improve upon bag of words methods for retrieval as well as classification tasks [2]. [sent-68, score-0.268]
</p><p>29 Other aggregation strategies such as learning feature weights have also been proposed to handle background clutter [1, 14] Although unsupervised codebooks continue to be popular, discriminative codebooks are known to be superior [32] as they aim to encode the differences between categories [24]. [sent-69, score-0.785]
</p><p>30 Our work is related to supervised learning of nearest neighbor quantizers [15] that optimize an objective based on minimizing information loss, and to treebased quantizers such as Extremely Randomized Clustering (ERC) forests proposed by Moosmann et al. [sent-70, score-0.181]
</p><p>31 However, these discriminative codebooks were learnt using image category labels in a setting where the number of categories i. [sent-72, score-0.382]
</p><p>32 Our codebooks are based on random forests [21] also, but are trained on many thousands of fine-grained descriptor labels. [sent-75, score-0.523]
</p><p>33 Like in [21], each tree in our forest serves as an independent randomized codebook, assigning each descriptor efficiently to one codevector per tree. [sent-76, score-0.39]
</p><p>34 In contrast, our method exploits robust matching in image collections and exploits SfM where after the first phase of pairwise image matching is performed, pairwise feature correspondences are linked over multiple images to produce long tracks i. [sent-81, score-0.178]
</p><p>35 The main focus of our paper however, is not on discovering the discriminative features but rather on learning a compact codebook from them in a way that retains their discriminative power. [sent-84, score-0.506]
</p><p>36 We first perform SfM computation [29] independently for each landmark to obtain sparse reconstructions of 3D points {Rk}kL=1 for the L landmarks1 . [sent-88, score-0.286]
</p><p>37 We refer to the set of feature descriptors corresponding to these keypoints as a track. [sent-90, score-0.189]
</p><p>38 Considering all the tracks together, we define a training set of labeled descriptors DT = {(xj, yj)}jn=1, where yj ∈ {1, . [sent-92, score-0.235]
</p><p>39 A codebook is then learnt from DT and subsequently huesre. [sent-98, score-0.375]
</p><p>40 1, we describe our method to learn a discriminative random forest codebook that exploits track labels. [sent-101, score-0.66]
</p><p>41 2, we discuss how this codebook is used with popular encoding schemes and our proposed variants. [sent-103, score-0.538]
</p><p>42 To classify an image, we extract local keypoints and compute feature descriptors which are then aggregated into a high-dimensional global image descriptor f by means of the learned codebook. [sent-104, score-0.277]
</p><p>43 To deal with potentially uneven viewpoint distributions common with landmark images, we adopt a randomized strategy to sample tracks from DT. [sent-113, score-0.381]
</p><p>44 Given the training set Ds with track laebestlism, our approach t oG ilveearnn t a e ra trnadinoming gfso reets Dt codebook from tracks (denoted as RFT) is now described. [sent-120, score-0.559]
</p><p>45 Unlike nearest neighbor quantizer codebooks, which are composed of a discrete set of codevectors ∈ Rd, the RFT codebook condtaisincsr one or more binary str ∈ees R each of which represents a partition of feature space based on recursive binary splits. [sent-121, score-0.517]
</p><p>46 The hyperplane parameters π at each tree node j are obtained by solving for the optimal πj∗ = arg maxπ∈Π Ij, where Π is a finite set of hyperplane hy-  potheses (splits) that are tested and Ij is the information gain defined in terms of the distribution of labels: Ij = H(Sj)  −? [sent-126, score-0.232]
</p><p>47 l The tree count T and maximum tree height h are parameters that determine the codebook size (T2h−1). [sent-133, score-0.621]
</p><p>48 Although extremely efficient, axis aligned RFT codebooks require larger tree height and tree count to match the accuracy possible with fewer trees, when general hyperplanes or nonlinear split functions are used [5]. [sent-137, score-0.568]
</p><p>49 Larger tree count or tree height both increase codebook size which is undesirable. [sent-138, score-0.621]
</p><p>50 Feature encoding Given a codebook that partitions feature space into regions called visual words, a local descriptor can be quantized into words and a histogram of all word occurrences in the image serves as its global descriptor. [sent-161, score-0.656]
</p><p>51 This is the bag  of words histogram BoW encoding [6, 28, 22]. [sent-162, score-0.202]
</p><p>52 Random forest codebooks (ERC, RFT) on the other hand, use tree traversal which takes time logarithmic in the number of codes. [sent-164, score-0.562]
</p><p>53 These codebooks assign multiple codes to a descriptor, one per tree, but then computes histograms similar to BoW methods. [sent-165, score-0.353]
</p><p>54 An alternative encoding called VLAD [13] used with K-means, encodes the difference between the K centroids and the descriptors assigned to them. [sent-166, score-0.226]
</p><p>55 An extra step is required during training, to use RFT codebooks with VLAD encoding. [sent-169, score-0.297]
</p><p>56 RFT codebooks with VLAD encoding allow fast assignment of descriptors to leaves via tree traversal and provides the benefit of multiple codes (one per tree). [sent-171, score-0.732]
</p><p>57 We also tried a variant of VLAD using soft-assignment weights, which can be viewed as a combination of VLAD with kernel codebook encoding [10]. [sent-172, score-0.552]
</p><p>58 Given a RFT codebook forest with K leaves, for each leaf, we compute the mean difference vector between its centroid and all the descriptors, weighting each difference vector using a Gaussian kernel. [sent-173, score-0.54]
</p><p>59 Importance-weighted Aggregation Most existing feature encoding schemes treat each local descriptor with equal importance. [sent-185, score-0.286]
</p><p>60 However, descriptors from parts of the image that contain background or irrelevant objects add noise to the global image descriptor which can hurt classification accuracy. [sent-186, score-0.237]
</p><p>61 We implement this using a second random forest, trained using all the track descriptors Ds as positive examples and a large set othfe descriptors eipxttorarsct Ded from generic images without landmarks as negatives. [sent-190, score-0.482]
</p><p>62 Given a descriptor x, this forest predicts the posterior probability p(x) that x is a track (i. [sent-191, score-0.282]
</p><p>63 is similar to a landmark feature), by using the empirical distribution of the labels of the training examples assigned to the predicted leaf. [sent-193, score-0.326]

</p><p>68 Different combinations of codebooks and encodings are denoted as A-B, where A and B refer to the codebook and encoding method respectively. [sent-219, score-0.86]

</p><p>73 A subset of the latter set, consisting of 100 examples per category, is used to train the final landmark classifier. [sent-260, score-0.312]
</p><p>74 Therefore, in all subsequent experiments, RFT codebooks were trained using this method. [sent-267, score-0.334]
</p><p>75 The number of trees and the tree depth affects the codebook size, and for a target size, various combinations were tested and the one with the best classification performance was retained. [sent-270, score-0.595]
</p><p>76 Note that the training and testing of our codebook is very efficient and is easy to parallelize, as the trees can be trained and traversed at test time independently. [sent-273, score-0.51]
</p><p>77 1that while using a RF codebook we perform the encoding by traversing the trees to determine the region of the feature space a given local descriptor belongs to, and then using the associated centroid. [sent-276, score-0.676]
</p><p>78 We train the vocabularies based on KM and HKM using 2M  local descriptors randomly sampled from 10K images; note that we tried to increase the quantity of training data but we did not see any additional boost in performance. [sent-281, score-0.267]
</p><p>79 With a BoW encoding, the RFT codebook produces more accurate results compared to discriminative codebooks ERC and IL, as well as as unsupervised HKM. [sent-287, score-0.753]
</p><p>80 Moreover our method is considerably faster to train compared to IL, and the feature encoding step using our codebook is more efficient. [sent-288, score-0.564]
</p><p>81 With the VLAD encoding, all the results that make use of our codebook RFT are better then or equal to all the other comparisons, showing the effectiveness of our approach even in this scenario. [sent-289, score-0.375]
</p><p>82 LANDMARK-620 is a new dataset that we created for large-scale landmark recognition. [sent-293, score-0.251]

</p><p>84 (c): Classification accuracy with RF-based codebooks trained using different weak learners. [sent-307, score-0.334]
</p><p>85 We created a test set of 62,000 images, by randomly selecting 100 images per landmark, and used the remaining to train the codebook and the classifier that is trained using 100-200 images per category. [sent-317, score-0.5]
</p><p>86 We first perform SfM again, this time only on the codebook training sets, obtaining a 3D reconstruction for each landmark. [sent-320, score-0.415]
</p><p>87 Note that each of them contains on average 172K 3D points; any landmark recognition system that requires to store the local descriptors of the models (e. [sent-321, score-0.357]
</p><p>88 We sample 400 tracks per category to learn our RFT codebook and the IWA random forest. [sent-326, score-0.532]
</p><p>89 We compare our codebook to HKM as its computational cost of aggregating local descriptor is comparable to ours. [sent-327, score-0.463]
</p><p>90 Both versions of these HKM codebooks are trained using 5M local descriptors randomly sampled from 20K images. [sent-331, score-0.44]
</p><p>91 Using a more effective encoding method like VLAD, and a descriptor dimensionality of 8192, our method RFT+VLAD achieves an accuracy of 61. [sent-340, score-0.208]
</p><p>92 Conclusions We proposed a new, efficient algorithm to learn a random forest codebook from local feature descriptors, where feature correspondence information is given. [sent-346, score-0.625]
</p><p>93 It is applicable to large-scale landmark classification, where our approach uses discriminative feature tracks discovered using SfM. [sent-347, score-0.425]
</p><p>94 We believe this is due to our use of discriminative tracks obtained using SfM as well as our ability to exploit fine-grained descriptor labels during codebook learning. [sent-349, score-0.637]
</p><p>95 For memory-efficient landmark classification, our accuracy rates are much higher than previously reported in the literature [16]. [sent-350, score-0.251]

<p>Author: unkown-author</p><p>Abstract: The objective of this paper is large scale object instance retrieval, given a query image. A starting point of such systems is feature detection and description, for example using SIFT. The focus of this paper, however, is towards very large scale retrieval where, due to storage requirements, very compact image descriptors are required and no information about the original SIFT descriptors can be accessed directly at run time. We start from VLAD, the state-of-the art compact descriptor introduced by J´ egou et al. [8] for this purpose, and make three novel contributions: first, we show that a simple change to the normalization method significantly improves retrieval performance; second, we show that vocabulary adaptation can substantially alleviate problems caused when images are added to the dataset after initial vocabulary learning. These two methods set a new stateof-the-art over all benchmarks investigated here for both mid-dimensional (20k-D to 30k-D) and small (128-D) descriptors.

<p>Author: Mihir Jain, Hervé Jégou, Patrick Bouthemy</p><p>Abstract: Several recent works on action recognition have attested the importance of explicitly integrating motion characteristics in the video description. This paper establishes that adequately decomposing visual motion into dominant and residual motions, both in the extraction of the space-time trajectories and for the computation of descriptors, significantly improves action recognition algorithms. Then, we design a new motion descriptor, the DCS descriptor, based on differential motion scalar quantities, divergence, curl and shear features. It captures additional information on the local motion patterns enhancing results. Finally, applying the recent VLAD coding technique proposed in image retrieval provides a substantial improvement for action recognition. Our three contributions are complementary and lead to outperform all reported results by a significant margin on three challenging datasets, namely Hollywood 2, HMDB51 and Olympic Sports. 1. Introduction and related work Human actions often convey the essential meaningful content in videos. Yet, recognizing human actions in un- constrained videos is a challenging problem in Computer Vision which receives a sustained attention due to the potential applications. In particular, there is a large interest in designing video-surveillance systems, providing some automatic annotation of video archives as well as improving human-computer interaction. The solutions proposed to address this problem inherit, to a large extent, from the techniques first designed for the goal of image search and classification. The successful local features developed to describe image patches [15, 23] have been translated in the 2D+t domain as spatio-temporal local descriptors [13, 30] and now include motion clues [29]. These descriptors are often extracted from spatial-temporal interest points [12, 3 1]. More recent techniques assume some underlying temporal motion model involving trajectories [2, 6, 7, 17, 18, 25, 29, 32]. Most of these approaches produce large set of local descriptors which are in turn aggregated to produce a single vector representing the video, in order to enable the use of powerful discriminative classifiers such as support vector machines (SVMs). This is usually done with the bag- Figure 1. Optical flow field vectors (green vectors with red end points) before and after dominant motion compensation. Most of the flow vectors due to camera motion are suppressed after compensation. One of the contributions of this paper is to show that compensating for the dominant motion is beneficial for most of the existing descriptors used for action recognition. of-words technique [24], which quantizes the local features using a k-means codebook. Thanks to the successful combination of this encoding technique with the aforementioned local descriptors, the state of the art in action recognition is able to go beyond the toy problems ofclassifying simple human actions in controlled environment and considers the detection of actions in real movies or video clips [11, 16]. Despite these progresses, the existing descriptors suffer from an uncompleted handling of motion in the video sequence. Motion is arguably the most reliable source of information for action recognition, as often related to the actions of interest. However, it inevitably involves the background or camera motion when dealing with uncontrolled and re- alistic situations. Although some attempts have been made to compensate camera motion in several ways [10, 21, 26, 29, 32], how to separate action motion from that caused by the camera, and how to reflect it in the video description remains an open issue. The motion compensation mechanism employed in [10] is tailor-made to the Motion Interchange Pattern encoding technique. The Motion Boundary Histogram (MBH) [29] is a recent appealing approach to 222555555533 suppress the constant motion by considering the flow gradient. It is robust to some extent to the presence of camera motion, yet it does not explicitly handle the camera motion. Another approach [26] uses a sophisticated and robust (RANSAC) estimation of camera motion. It first segments the color image into regions corresponding to planar parts in the scene and estimates the (three) dominant homographies to update the motion associated with local features. A rather different view is adopted in [32] where the motion decomposition is performed at the trajectory level. All these works support the potential of motion compensation. As the first contribution of this paper, we address the problem in a way that departs from these works by considering the compensation of the dominant motion in both the tracking stages and encoding stages involved in the computation of action recognition descriptors. We rely on the pioneering works on motion compensation such as the technique proposed in [20], that considers 2D polynomial affine motion models for estimating the dominant image motion. We consider this particular model for its robustness and its low computational cost. It was already used in [21] to separate the dominant motion (assumed to be due to the camera motion) and the residual motion (corresponding to the independent scene motions) for dynamic event recognition in videos. However, the statistical modeling of both motion components was global (over the entire image) and only the normal flow was computed for the latter. Figure 1 shows the vectors of optical flow before and after applying the proposed motion compensation. Our method successfully suppresses most of the background motion and reinforces the focus towards the action of interest. We exploit this compensated motion both for descriptor computation and for extracting trajectories. However, we also show that the camera motion should not be thrown as it contains complementary information that is worth using to recognize certain action categories. Then, we introduce the Divergence-Curl-Shear (DCS) descriptor, which encodes scalar first-order motion features, namely the motion divergence, curl and shear. It captures physical properties of the flow pattern that are not involved in the best existing descriptors for action recognition, except in the work of [1] which exploits divergence and vorticity among a set of eleven kinematic features computed from the optical flow. Our DCS descriptor provides a good performance recognition performance on its own. Most importantly, it conveys some information which is not captured by existing descriptors and further improves the recognition performance when combined with the other descriptors. As a last contribution, we bring an encoding technique known as VLAD (vector oflocal aggregated descriptors) [8] to the field of action recognition. This technique is shown to be better than the bag-of-words representation for combining all the local video descriptors we have considered. The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the motion properties that we will consider through this paper. Section 3 presents the datasets and classification scheme used in our different evaluations. Section 4 details how we revisit several popular descriptors of the literature by the means of dominant motion compensation. Our DCS descriptor based on kinematic properties is introduced in Section 5 and improved by the VLAD encoding technique, which is introduced and bench-marked in Section 6 for several video descriptors. Section 7 provides a comparison showing the large improvement achieved over the state of the art. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper. 2. Motion Separation and Kinematic Features In this section, we describe the motion clues we incorporate in our action recognition framework. We separate the dominant motion and the residual motion. In most cases, this will account to distinguishing the impact of camera movement and independent actions. Note that we do not aim at recovering the 3D camera motion: The 2D parametric motion model describes the global (or dominant) motion between successive frames. We first explain how we estimate the dominant motion and employ it to separate the dominant flow from the optical flow. Then, we will introduce kinematic features, namely divergence, curl and shear for a more comprehensive description of the visual motion. 2.1. Affine motion for compensating camera motion Among polynomial motion models, we consider the 2D affine motion model. Simplest motion models such as the 4parameter model formed by the combination of 2D translation, 2D rotation and scaling, or more complex ones such as the 8-parameter quadratic model (equivalent to a homography), could be selected as well. The affine model is a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency which is of primary importance when processing a huge video database. It does have limitations since strictly speaking it implies a single plane assumption for the static background. However, this is not that penalizing (especially for outdoor scenes) if differences in depth remain moderated with respect to the distance to the camera. The affine flow vector at point p = (x, y) and at time t, is defined as waff(pt) =?cc12((t ) ?+?aa31((t ) aa42((t ) ? ?xytt?. (1) = + + = + uaff(pt) c1(t) a1(t)xt a2(t)yt and vaff(pt) c2(t) a3 (t)xt + a4(t)yt are horizontal and vertical components of waff(pt) respectively. Let us denote the optical flow vector at point p at time t as w(pt) = (u(pt) , v(pt)). We introduce the flow vector ω(pt) obtained by removing the affine flow vector from the optical flow vector ω(pt) = w(pt) − waff(pt) . (2) 222555555644 The dominant motion (estimated as waff(pt)) is usually due to the camera motion. In this case, Equation 2 amounts to canceling (or compensating) the camera motion. Note that this is not always true. For example in case of close-up on a moving actor, the dominant motion will be the affine estimation of the apparent actor motion. The interpretation of the motion compensation output will not be that straightforward in this case, however the resulting ω-field will still exhibit different patterns for the foreground action part and the background part. In the remainder, we will refer to the “compensated” flow as ω-flow. Figure 1 displays the computed optical flow and the ωflow. We compute the affine flow with the publicly available Motion2D software1 [20] which implements a realtime robust multiresolution incremental estimation framework. The affine motion model has correctly accounted for the motion induced by the camera movement which corresponds to the dominant motion in the image pair. Indeed, we observe that the compensated flow vectors in the background are close to null and the compensated flow in the foreground, i.e., corresponding to the actors, is conversely inflated. The experiments presented along this paper will show that effective separation of dominant motion from the residual motions is beneficial for action recognition. As explained in Section 4, we will compute local motion descriptors, such as HOF, on both the optical flow and the compensated flow (ω-flow), which allows us to explicitly and directly characterize the scene motion. 2.2. Local kinematic features By kinematic features, we mean local first-order differential scalar quantities computed on the flow field. We consider the divergence, the curl (or vorticity) and the hyperbolic terms. They inform on the physical pattern of the flow so that they convey useful information on actions in videos. They can be computed from the first-order derivatives of the flow at every point p at every frame t as ⎨⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎧hcdyuipvr1l2(p t) = −∂ u ∂ (yxp(xtp) +−∂ v ∂ v(px ypxt ) The diverg⎪⎩ence is related to axial motion, expansion scaling effects, the curl to rotation in the image plane. hyperbolic terms express the shear of the visual flow responding to more complex configuration. We take account the shear quantity only: shear(pt) = ?hyp12(pt) + hyp22(pt). (3) and The corinto (4) 1http://www.irisa.fr/vista/Motion2D/ In Section 5, we propose the DCS descriptor that is based on the kinematic features (divergence, curl and shear) of the visual motion discussed in this subsection. It is computed on either the optical or the compensated flow, ω-flow. 3. Datasets and evaluation This section first introduces the datasets used for the evaluation. Then, we briefly present the bag-of-feature model and the classification scheme used to encode the descriptors which will be introduced in Section 4. Hollywood2. The Hollywood2 dataset [16] contains 1,707 video clips from 69 movies representing 12 action classes. It is divided into train set and test set of 823 and 884 samples respectively. Following the standard evaluation protocol of this benchmark, we use average precision (AP) for each class and the mean of APs (mAP) for evaluation. HMDB51. The HMDB51 dataset [11] is a large dataset containing 6,766 video clips extracted from various sources, ranging from movies to YouTube. It consists of 51 action classes, each having at least 101 samples. We follow the evaluation protocol of [11] and use three train/test splits, each with 70 training and 30 testing samples per class. The average classification accuracy is computed over all classes. Out of the two released sets, we use the original set as it is more challenging and used by most of the works reporting results in action recognition. Olympic Sports. The third dataset we use is Olympic Sports [19], which again is obtained from YouTube. This dataset contains 783 samples with 16 sports action classes. We use the provided2 train/test split, there are 17 to 56 training samples and 4 to 11test samples per class. Mean AP is used for the evaluation, which is the standard choice. Bag of features and classification setup. We first adopt the standard BOF [24] approach to encode all kinds of descriptors. It produces a vector that serves as the video representation. The codebook is constructed for each type of descriptor separately by the k-means algorithm. Following a common practice in the literature [27, 29, 30], the codebook size is set to k=4,000 elements. Note that Section 6 will consider encoding technique for descriptors. For the classification, we use a non-linear SVM with χ2kernel. When combining different descriptors, we simply add the kernel matrices, as done in [27]: K(xi,xj) = exp?−?cγ1cD(xic,xjc)?, 2http://vision.stanford.edu/Datasets/OlympicSports/ 222555555755 (5) where D(xic, xjc) is χ2 distance between video xic and xjc with respect to c-th channel, corresponding to c-th descriptor. The quantity γc is the mean value of χ2 distances between the training samples for the c-th channel. The multiclass classification problem that we consider is addressed by applying a one-against-rest approach. 4. Compensated descriptors This section describes how the compensation ofthe dominant motion is exploited to improve the quality of descriptors encoding the motion and the appearance around spatio-temporal positions, hence the term “compensated descriptors”. First, we briefly review the local descriptors [5, 13, 16, 29, 30] used here along with dense trajectories [29]. Second, we analyze the impact of motion flow compensation when used in two different stages of the descriptor computation, namely in the tracking and the description part. 4.1. Dense trajectories and local descriptors Employing dense trajectories to compute local descriptors is one of the state-of-the-art approaches for action recognition. It has been shown [29] that when local descriptors are computed over dense trajectories the performance improves considerably compared to when computed over spatio temporal features [30]. Dense Trajectories [29]: The trajectories are obtained by densely tracking sampled points using optical flow fields. First, feature points are sampled from a dense grid, with step size of 5 pixels and over 8 scales. Each feature point pt = (xt, yt) at frame t is then tracked to the next frame by median filtering in a dense optical flow field F = (ut, vt) as follows: pt+1 = (xt+1 , yt+1) = (xt, yt) + (M ∗ F) | (x ¯t,y ¯t) , (6) where M is the kernel of median filtering and ( x¯ t, y¯ t) is the rounded position of (xt, yt). The tracking is limited to L (=15) frames to avoid any drifting effect. Excessively short trajectories and trajectories exhibiting sudden large displacements are removed as they induce some artifacts. Trajectories must be understood here as tracks in the spacetime volume of the video. Local descriptors: The descriptors are computed within a space-time volume centered around each trajectory. Four types of descriptors are computed to encode the shape of the trajectory, local motion pattern and appearance, namely Trajectory [29], HOF (histograms of optical flow) [13], MBH [4] and HOG (histograms of oriented gradients) [3]. All these descriptors depend on the flow field used for the tracking and as input of the descriptor computation: 1. The Trajectory descriptor encodes the shape of the trajectory represented by the normalized relative coor- × dinates of the successive points forming the trajectory. It directly depends on the dense flow used for tracking points. 2. HOF is computed using the orientations and magnitudes of the flow field. 3. MBH is designed to capture the gradient of horizontal and vertical components of the flow. The motion boundaries encode the relative pixel motion and therefore suppress camera motion, but only to some extent. 4. HOG encodes the appearance by using the intensity gradient orientations and magnitudes. It is formally not a motion descriptor. Yet the position where the descriptor is computed depends on the trajectory shape. As in [29], volume around a feature point is divided into a 2 2 3 space-time grid. The orientations are quantized ian 2to × ×8 b2i ×ns 3fo srp HacOe-Gti amned g g9r ibdi.ns T fhoer o oHriOenFt (awtioitnhs one a qdudainttiiozneadl zero bin). The horizontal and vertical components of MBH are separately quantized into 8 bins each. 4.2. Impact of motion compensation The optical flow is simply referred to as flow in the following, while the compensated flow (see subsection 2. 1) is denoted by ω-flow. Both of them are considered in the tracking and descriptor computation stages. The trajectories obtained by tracking with the ω-flow are called ω-trajectories. Figure 2 comparatively illustrates the ωtrajectories and the trajectories obtained using the flow. The input video shows a man moving away from the car. In this video excerpt, the camera is following the man walking to the right, thus inducing a global motion to the left in the video. When using the flow, the computed trajectories reflect the combination of these two motion components (camera and scene motion) as depicted by Subfigure 2(b), which hampers the characterization of the current action. In contrast, the ω-trajectories plotted in Subfigure 2(c) are more active on the actor moving on the foreground, while those localized in the background are now parallel to the time axis enhancing static parts of the scene. The ω-trajectories are therefore more relevant for action recognition, since they are more regularly and more exclusively following the actor’s motion. Impact on Trajectory and HOG descriptors. Table 1reports the impact of ω-trajectories on Trajectory and HOG descriptors, which are both significantly improved by 3%4% of mAP on the two datasets. When improved by ωflow, these descriptors will be respectively referred to as ω-Trajdesc and ω-HOG in the rest of the paper. Although the better performance of ω-Trajdesc versus the original Trajectory descriptor was expected, the one 222555555866 2. Trajectories obtained from optical and compensated flows.

Our interpretation is that HOG captures more context with the modified trajectories. More precisely, the original HOG descriptor is computed from a 2D+t sub-volume aligned with the corresponding trajectory and hence represents the appearance along the trajectory shape. When using ω-flow, we do not align the video sequence. As a result, the ω-HOG descriptor is no more computed around the very same tracked physical point in the space-time volume but around points lying in a patch of the initial feature point, whose size depends on the affine flow magnitude. ω-HOG can be viewed as a “patchbased” computation capturing more information about the appearance of the background or of the moving foreground. As for ω-trajectories, they are closer to the real trajectories of the moving actors as they usually cancel the camera movement, and so, more easier to train and recognize. Impact on HOF. The ω-flow impacts computation used as an input to HOF computation itself. Therefore, HOF can both types of trajectories (ω-trajectories both the trajectory and the descriptor be computed along or those extracted MethodHollywood2HMDB51 Table(ω2rHf.-alocO IwomkF)inpHgacOtFobf[2u9ωhsb]i:f-nlo ωgwot-hwωHOflFown5H 02 34O. 58291F% %descripto3 r706s38.:–1076% m%APfor Hollywood2 and average accuracy for HMDB5 1. The ω-HOF is used in subsequent evaluations. from flow) and can encode both kinds of flows (ω-flow or flow). For the sake of completeness, we evaluate all the variants as well as the combination of both flows in the descriptor computation stage. The results are presented in Table 2 and demonstrate the significant improvement obtained by computing the HOF descriptor with the ω-flow instead of the optical flow. Note that the type of trajectories which is used, either “Tracking flow” or “Tracking ω-flow”, has a limited impact in this case. From now on, we only consider the “Tracking ω-flow” case where HOF is computed along ω-trajectories. Interestingly, combining the HOF computed from the flow and the ω-flow further improves the results. This suggests that the two flow fields are complementary and the affine flow that was subtracted from ω-flow brings in additional information. For the sake of brevity, the combination of the two kinds of HOF, i.e., computed from the flow and the ω-flow using ω-trajectories, is referred to as the ω-HOF 222555555977 MethodHollywood2HMDB51 Tab(lerT3a.cIkmM inpBgMacHgωtBf-loH w [u2)s9in]gω f-lo wo MBH5 d42 e.052s7c% riptos:m34A90P.–3769f% orHllywood2 and average accuracy for HMDB5 1.

Compared to the HOF baseline, the ω-HOF descriptor achieves a gain of +3.1% of mAP on Hollywood 2 and of +7.8% on HMDB51. Impact on MBH. Since MBH is computed from gradient of flow and cancel the constant motion, there is practically no benefit in using the ω-flow to compute the MBH descriptors, as shown in Table 3. However, by tracking ω-flow, the performance improves by around 1.3% for HMDB5 1 dataset and drops by around 1.5% for Hollywood2. This relative performance depends on the encoding technique. We will come back on this descriptor when considering another encoding scheme for local descriptors in Section 6. 4.3. Summary of compensated descriptors Table 4 summarizes the refined versions of the descriptors obtained by exploiting the ω-flow, and both ω-flow and the optical flow in the case of HOF. The revisited descriptors considerably improve the results compared to the orig- inal ones, with the noticeable exception of ω-MBH which gives mixed performance with a bag-of-features encoding scheme. But we already mention as this point that this incongruous behavior of ω-MBH is stabilized with the VLAD encoding scheme considered in Section 6. Another advantage of tracking the compensated flow is that fewer trajectories are produced. For instance, the total number of trajectories decreases by about 9. 16% and 22.81% on the Hollywood2 and HMDB51 datasets, respectively. Note that exploiting both the flow and the ω-flow do not induce much computational overhead, as the latter is obtained from the flow and the affine flow which is computed in real-time and already used to get the ω-trajectories. The only additional computational cost that we introduce by using the descriptors summarized in Table 4 is the computation of a second HOF descriptor, but this stage is relatively efficient and not the bottleneck of the extraction procedure. 5. Divergence-Curl-Shear descriptor This section introduces a new descriptor encoding the kinematic properties of motion discussed in Section 2.2. It is denoted by DCS in the rest of this paper. Combining kinematic features. The spatial derivatives are computed for the horizontal and vertical components of the flow field, which are used in turn to compute the divergence, curl and shear scalar values, see Equation 3. We consider all possible pairs of kinematic features, namely (div, curl), (div, shear) and (curl, shear). At each × ×× pixel, we compute the orientation and magnitude of the 2-D vector corresponding to each of these pairs. The orientation is quantized into histograms and the magnitude is used for weighting, similar to SIFT. Our motivation for encoding pairs is that the joint distribution of kinematic features conveys more information than exploiting them independently. Implementation details. The descriptor computation and parameters are similar to HOG and other popular descriptors such as MBH, HOF. We obtain 8-bin histograms for each of the three feature pairs or components of DCS. The range of possible angles is 2π for the (div,curl) pair and π for the other pairs, because the shear is always positive. The DCS descriptor is computed for a space-time volume aligned with a trajectory, as done with the four descriptors mentioned in the previous section. In order to capture the spatio-temporal structure of kinematic features, the volume (32 32 pixels and L = 15 frames) is subdivided into a spatio-temporal grid nofd s Lize = nx 5× f ny m×e nt, sw situhb nx =de ny =to 2a and nt = 3. These parameters ×hnave× × bneen fixed for the sake of consistency with the other descriptors. For each pair of kinematic features, each cell in the grid is represented by a histogram.

VLAD in actions VLAD [8] is a descriptor encoding technique that aggregates the descriptors based on a locality criterion in the feature space. To our knowledge, this technique has never been considered for action recognition. Below, we briefly introduce this approach and give the performance achieved for all the descriptors introduced along the previous sections. VLAD in brief. Similar to BOF, VLAD relies on a codebook C = {c1, c2 , ...ck} of k centroids learned by k-means. bTohoek representation is ob}t oaifn ked c by summing, efodr b yea kch-m mveiasunasl. word ci, the differences x − ci of the vectors x assigned to ci, thereby producing a sv exct −or c representation oflength d×k, 222555556088 DMeBscHriptorV5 LH.A1o%Dlywo5Bo4d.O2 %F4V3L.3HA%MD B35B91.O7%F Taωbl-eDHM5rOCBa.FSjGPdHe+rsωfco-mMHaBOnFeofV54L2936A.51D% with5431ω208-.5T96% rajde3s42c97158,.ω3% -HOG342,58019ω.6-% HOF descriptors and their combination. where d is the dimension ofthe local descriptors. We use the codebook size, k = 256. Despite this large dimensionality, VLAD is efficient because it is effectively compared with a linear kernel. VLAD is post-processed using a componentwise power normalization, which dramatically improves its performance [8]. While cross validating the parameter α involved in this power normalization, we consistently observe, for all the descriptors, a value between 0.15 and 0.3. Therefore, this parameter is set to α = 0.2 in all our experiments. For classification, we use a linear SVM and oneagainst-rest approach everywhere, unless stated otherwise. Impact on existing descriptors. We employ VLAD because it is less sensitive to quantization parameters and appears to provide better performance with descriptors having a large dimensionality. These properties are interesting in our case, because the quantization parameters involved in the DCS and MBH descriptors have been used unchanged in Section 4 for the sake of direct comparison. They might be suboptimal when using the ω-flow instead of the optical flow on which they have initially been optimized [29]. Results for MBH and ω-MBH in Table 5 supports this argument. When using VLAD instead of BOF, the scores are stable in both the cases and there is no mixed inference as that observed in Table 3. VLAD also has significant positive influence on accuracy of ω-DCS descriptor. We also observe that ω-DCS is complementary to ω-MBH and adds to the performance. Still DCS is probably not best utilized in the current setting of parameters. In case of ω-Trajdesc and ω-HOG, the scores are better with BOF on both the datasets. ω-HOF with VLAD improves on HMDB5 1, but remains equivalent for Hollywood2. Although BOF leads to better scores for the descriptors considered individually, their combination with VLAD outperforms the BOF. 7.

Table 6 reports the results obtained when the descriptors are combined. Since we use VLAD, our baseline is updated that is combination of Trajectory, HOG, HOF and MBH with VLAD representation. When DCS is added to the baseline there is an improvement of 0.9% and 1.2%. With combination of all five compensated descriptors we obtain 62.5% and 52.1% on the two datasets. This is a large improvement even over the updated baseline, which shows that the proposed motion compensation and the way we exploit it are significantly important for action recognition. The comparison with the state of the art is shown in Table 7. Our method outperforms all the previously reported results in the literature. In particular, on the HMDB51 dataset, the improvement over the best reported results to date is more than 11% in average accuracy. Jiang el al. [9] used a one-against-one multi-class SVM, which might have resulted in inferior scores. With a similar multi-class SVM approach, our method obtains 45. 1%, which remains significantly better than their result. All others results were reported with one-against-rest approach. On Olympic Sports dataset we obtain mAP of 83.2% with ‘All ω-descriptors combined’ and the improvement is mostly because of VLAD and ω-flow. The best reported mAPs on this dataset are Liu et al. [14] (74.4%) and Jiang et al. [9] (80.6%), which we exceed convincingly. Gaidon et al. [6] reports the best average accuracy of 82.7%. 8. Conclusions This paper first demonstrates the interest of canceling the dominant motion (predominantly camera motion) to make the visual motion truly related to actions, for both the trajectory extraction and descriptor computation stages. It pro222555556199 duces significantly better versions (called compensated descriptors) of several state-of-the-art local descriptors for action recognition. The simplicity, efficiency and effectiveness of this motion compensation approach make it applicable to any action recognition framework based on motion descriptors and trajectories. The second contribution is the new DCS descriptor derived from the first-order scalar motion quantities specifying the local motion patterns. It captures additional information which is proved complementary to the other descriptors. Finally, we show that VLAD encoding technique instead of bag-of-words boosts several action descriptors, and overall exhibits a significantly better performance when combining different types of descriptors. Our contributions are all complementary and significantly outperform the state of the art when combined, as demon- strated by our extensive experiments on the Hollywood 2, HMDB51 and Olympic Sports datasets.

<p>Author: Jamie Shotton, Ben Glocker, Christopher Zach, Shahram Izadi, Antonio Criminisi, Andrew Fitzgibbon</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the pose of an RGB-D camera relative to a known 3D scene, given only a single acquired image. Our approach employs a regression forest that is capable of inferring an estimate of each pixel’s correspondence to 3D points in the scene ’s world coordinate frame. The forest uses only simple depth and RGB pixel comparison features, and does not require the computation of feature descriptors. The forest is trained to be capable of predicting correspondences at any pixel, so no interest point detectors are required. The camera pose is inferred using a robust optimization scheme. This starts with an initial set of hypothesized camera poses, constructed by applying the forest at a small fraction of image pixels. Preemptive RANSAC then iterates sampling more pixels at which to evaluate the forest, counting inliers, and refining the hypothesized poses. We evaluate on several varied scenes captured with an RGB-D camera and observe that the proposed technique achieves highly accurate relocalization and substantially out-performs two state of the art baselines.</p><p>6 0.13979913 <a title="268-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Part_Discovery_from_Partial_Correspondence.html">325 cvpr-2013-Part Discovery from Partial Correspondence</a></p>

<p>Author: Alessandro Bergamo, Sudipta N. Sinha, Lorenzo Torresani</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new technique for learning a discriminative codebook for local feature descriptors, specifically designed for scalable landmark classification. The key contribution lies in exploiting the knowledge of correspondences within sets offeature descriptors during codebook learning. Feature correspondences are obtained using structure from motion (SfM) computation on Internet photo collections which serve as the training data. Our codebook is defined by a random forest that is trained to map corresponding feature descriptors into identical codes. Unlike prior forest-based codebook learning methods, we utilize fine-grained descriptor labels and address the challenge of training a forest with an extremely large number of labels. Our codebook is used with various existing feature encoding schemes and also a variant we propose for importanceweighted aggregation of local features. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset of 25 landmarks and our new dataset of 620 landmarks (614K images). Our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art in landmark classification. Furthermore, our method is memory efficient and scalable.</p><p>2 0.82902384 <a title="268-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-All_About_VLAD.html">38 cvpr-2013-All About VLAD</a></p>
<p>Author: unkown-author</p><p>Abstract: The objective of this paper is large scale object instance retrieval, given a query image. A starting point of such systems is feature detection and description, for example using SIFT. The focus of this paper, however, is towards very large scale retrieval where, due to storage requirements, very compact image descriptors are required and no information about the original SIFT descriptors can be accessed directly at run time. We start from VLAD, the state-of-the art compact descriptor introduced by J´ egou et al. [8] for this purpose, and make three novel contributions: first, we show that a simple change to the normalization method significantly improves retrieval performance; second, we show that vocabulary adaptation can substantially alleviate problems caused when images are added to the dataset after initial vocabulary learning. These two methods set a new stateof-the-art over all benchmarks investigated here for both mid-dimensional (20k-D to 30k-D) and small (128-D) descriptors. Our third contribution is a multiple spatial VLAD representation, MultiVLAD, that allows the retrieval and local- ization of objects that only extend over a small part of an image (again without requiring use of the original image SIFT descriptors).</p><p>3 0.73554575 <a title="268-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Binary_Codes_for_High-Dimensional_Data_Using_Bilinear_Projections.html">246 cvpr-2013-Learning Binary Codes for High-Dimensional Data Using Bilinear Projections</a></p>

<p>Author: Xavier Boix, Michael Gygli, Gemma Roig, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: The representation of local image patches is crucial for the good performance and efficiency of many vision tasks. Patch descriptors have been designed to generalize towards diverse variations, depending on the application, as well as the desired compromise between accuracy and efficiency. We present a novel formulation of patch description, that serves such issues well. Sparse quantization lies at its heart. This allows for efficient encodings, leading to powerful, novel binary descriptors, yet also to the generalization of existing descriptors like SIFTorBRIEF. We demonstrate the capabilities of our formulation for both keypoint matching and image classification. Our binary descriptors achieve state-of-the-art results for two keypoint matching benchmarks, namely those by Brown [6] and Mikolajczyk [18].

<p>Author: Mohammad Norouzi, David J. Fleet</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental limitation of quantization techniques like the k-means clustering algorithm is the storage and runtime cost associated with the large numbers of clusters required to keep quantization errors small and model fidelity high. We develop new models with a compositional parameterization of cluster centers, so representational capacity increases super-linearly in the number of parameters. This allows one to effectively quantize data using billions or trillions of centers. We formulate two such models, Orthogonal k-means and Cartesian k-means. They are closely related to one another, to k-means, to methods for binary hash function optimization like ITQ [5], and to Product Quantization for vector quantization [7]. The models are tested on largescale ANN retrieval tasks (1M GIST, 1B SIFT features), and on codebook learning for object recognition (CIFAR-10). 1. Introduction and background Techniques for vector quantization, like the well-known k-means algorithm, are used widely in vision and learning. Common applications include codebook learning for object recognition [16], and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search for information retrieval [12, 14]. In general terms, such techniques involve partitioning an input vector space into multiple regions {Si}ik=1, mapping points x in each region uinlttiop region-specific representatives {ci}ik=1, known as cioennte irnst.o A resg siuonch-,s a quantizer, qse(nxt)a,t can b {ec expressed as k q(x) = ?1(x∈Si)ci, (1) i?= ?1 where 1(·) is the usual indicator function. eTrhee 1 quality oef u a quantizer oisr expressed in terms of expected distortion, a common measure of which is squared error ?x − q(x) ?22. In this case, given centers {ci}, the region t ?ox xw −hic qh(x a point nis t assigned gwivitehn m ceinnitemrasl {dcis}to,r tthioen r eisobtained by Euclidean nearest neighbor (NN) search. The k-means algorithm can be used to learn centers from data. To reduce expected distortion, crucial for many applications, one can shrink region volumes by increasing k, the number of regions. In practice, however, increasing k results in prohibitive storage and run-time costs. Even if one resorts to ANN search with approximate k-means [14] or hierarchical k-means [12], it is hard to scale to large k (e.g., k = 264), as storing the centers is untenable. This paper concerns methods for scalable quantization with tractable storage and run-time costs. Inspired by Product Quantization (PQ), a state-of-the-art algorithm for ANN search with high-dimensional data (e.g., [7]), compositionality is one key. By expressing data in terms of recurring, reusable parts, the representational capacity of compositional models grows exponentially in the number ofparameters. Compression techniques like JPEG accomplish this by encoding images as disjoint rectangular patches. PQ divides the feature space into disjoint subspaces that are quantized independently. Other examples include part-based recognition models (e.g., [18]), and tensor-based models for stylecontent separation (e.g., [17]). Here, with a compositional parameterization of region centers, we find a family of models that reduce the enc√oding cost of k centers down from k to between log2 k and √k. A model parameter controls the trade-off between model fidelity and compactness. We formulate two related algorithms, Orthogonal kmeans (ok-means) and Cartesian k-means (ck-means). They are natural extensions of k-means, and are closely related to other hashing and quantization methods. The okmeans algorithm is a generalization of the Iterative Quantization (ITQ) algorithm for finding locality-sensitive binary codes [5]. The ck-means model is an extension of okmeans, and can be viewed as a generalization of PQ.1 We then report empirical results on large-scale ANN search tasks, and on codebook learning for recognition. For ANN search we use datasets of 1M GIST and 1B SIFT features, with both symmetric and asymmetric distance measures on the latent codes. We consider codebook learning for a generic form of recognition on CIFAR-10. 2. k-means Given a dataset of n p-dim points, D ≡ {xj }jn=1, the kmeans algorithm partitions ithme n points in ≡to { kx c}lusters, and 1A very similar generalization of PQ, was developed concurrently by Ge, He, Ke and Sun, and also appears in CVPR 2013 [4]. 333000111755 represents each cluster by a center point. Let C ∈ Rp×k breep a mseantrtsix e wachhos celu sctoelurm byns a comprise tihnet .k Lceltus Cter ∈ centers, i.e., C = [c1, c2 , · · · , ck] . The k-means objective is to minimize the within,-c··lu·s ,tecr squared distances: ?k-means(C) = = x?∈Dmiin?x − ci?22 x?∈Db∈mHin1/k?x − Cb?22 (2) where H1/k ≡ {b | b ∈ {0, 1}k and ?b? = 1}, i.e., b is a binary vee Hctor comprising a ,1-1o}f-ka encoding. Lloyd’s b k- imse aa bni-s algorithm [11] finds a local minimum of (2) by iterative, alternating optimization with respect to C and the b’s. The k-means model is simple and intuitive, using NN search to assign points to centers. The assignment of points to centers can be represented with a log k-bit index per data point. The cost of storing the centers grows linearly with k. 3. Orthogonal k-means with 2m centers With a compositional model one can represent cluster centers more efficiently. One such approach is to re- construct each input with an additive combination of the columns of C. To this end, instead of the 1-of-k encoding in (2), we let b be a general m-bit vector, b ∈ Hm ≡ {0, 1}m, (a2n)d, wCe e∈ l Rt bp× bme. aA gse nsuerchal, meac-bhi tc vluesctteorr c, ebnt ∈er H His th≡e sum o}f a asundbs Cet o∈f Rthe columns of C. There are 2m possible subsets, and therefore k = 2m centers. While the number of parameters in the quantizer is linear in m, the number of centers increases exponentially. While efficient in representing cluster centers, the approach is problematic, because solving bˆ = abrg∈Hmmin?x − Cb?22,(3) is intractable; i.e., the discrete optimization is not submodular. Obviously, for small 2m one could generate all possible centers and then perform NN search to find the optimal solution, but this would not scale well to large values of m. One key observation is that if the columns of C are orthogonal, then optimization (3) becomes tractable. To explain this, without loss of generality, assume the bits belong to {−1, 1} instead of {0, 1}, i.e., b? ∈ Hm? ≡ {−1, 1}m. tToh e{−n, ?x − Cb??22 = xTx + b?TCTCb? − 2xTCb? .(4) For diagonal CTC, the middle quadratic term on the RHS becomes trace(CTC), independent of b?. As a consequence, when C has orthogonal columns, abr?g∈mH?min?x − Cb??22 = sgn(CTx) ,(5) where sgn(·) is the element-wise sign function. Cluster centers are depicted by dots, and cluster boundaries by dashed lines. (Left) Clusters formed by a 2-cube with no rotation, scaling or translation; centers = {b? |b? ∈ H2? }. (Right) Rotation, scaling and translation are used to reduce distances between data points and cluster centers; centers = {μ + RDb? | b? ∈ H2? }. To reduce quantization error further we can also introduce an offset, denoted μ, to translate x. Taken together with (5), this leads to the loss function for the model we call orthogonal k-means (ok-means):2 ?ok-means(C,μ) = x?∈Db?m∈iHn?m?x − μ − Cb??22. (6) Clearly, with a change of variables, b? = 2b −1, we can define new versions of μ and C, with ide=ntic 2abl −lo1s,s, w wfoer c wanh dicehthe unknowns are binary, but in {0, 1}m.

The transform, via C and μ, maps the hypercube vertices onto the input feature space, ideally as close as possible to the data points. The matrix C has orthogonal columns and can therefore be expressed in terms of rotation and scaling; i.e., C ≡ RD, where R ∈ Rp×m has orthonormal cinoglu;m i.ne.s, ( CRT ≡R = R DIm,) w, ahnerde eD R Ris ∈ diagonal and positive definite. The goal of learning is to find the parameters, R, D, and μ, which minimize quantization error. Fig. 1 depicts a small set of 2D data points (red x’s) and two possible quantizations. Fig. 1 (left) depicts the vertices of a 2-cube with C = I2 and zero translation. The cluster regions are simply the four quadrants of the 2D space. The distances between data points and cluster centers, i.e., the quantization errors, are relatively large. By comparison, Fig. 1 (right) shows how a transformed 2-cube, the full model, can greatly reduce quantization errors. 3.1. Learning ok-means To derive the learning algorithm for ok-means we first rewrite the objective in matrix terms. Given n data points, let X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] ∈ Rp×n.

Like k-means, coordinate descent is effective for optimizing (8). We first initialize μ and R, and then iteratively optimize ?ok-means with respect to B?, D, R, and μ: • Optimize B? and D: With straightforward algebraic manipulation, one can show that ?ok-means = ?RTX?−DB??f2 + ?R⊥TX??f2 , (9) where columns of R⊥ span the orthogonal complement of the column-space of R (i.e., the block matrix [R R⊥] is orthogonal). It follows that, given X? and R, we can optimize the first term in (9) to solve for B? and D. Here, DB? is the leastsquares approximation to RTX?, where RTX? and DB? × are m n.

Approximate nearest neighbor search One application of scalable quantization is ANN search. Before introducing more advanced quantization techniques, we describe some experimental results with ok-means on Euclidean ANN search. The benefits of ok-means for ANN search are two-fold. Storage costs for the centers is reduced to O(log k), from O(k) with k-means. Second, substantial speedups are possible by exploiting fast methods for NN search on binary codes in Hamming space (e.g., [13]). Generally, in terms of a generic quantizer q(·), there are twoG neanteurraalll ways etrom messti omfa ate g ethneer dicis qtaunanceti z beetrw qe(·e)n, ttwheor vectors, v and u [7].

For ANN search, in a pre-processing stage, each database entry, u, is encoded into a binary vector corresponding to the cluster center index to which u is assigned. At test time, the queries may or may not be encoded into indices, depending on whether one uses SQD or AQD. In the ok-means model, the quantization of an input x is straightforwardly shown to be qok(x) = μ + RD sgn(RT(x − μ)) . (13) The corresponding m-bit cluster index is sgn(RT(x − μ)). Given two indices, namely b?1 , b?2 ∈ {−1, +1}m,( txhe − symmetric ok-means quantizer distance∈ ∈is { SQDok(b?1, b?2) = ?μ + RDb?1 − μ − RDb?2 ?22 = ?D(b?1 − b?2)?22 .(14) In effect, SQDok is a weighted Hamming distance. It is the sum of the squared diagonal entries of D corresponding to bits where b?1 and b?2 differ. Interestingly, in our experiments with ok-means, Hamming and weighted Hamming distances yield similar results. Thus, in ok-means experiments we simply report results for Hamming distance, to facilitate comparisons with other techniques. When the scaling in ok-means is constrained to be isotropic (i.e., D = αIm for α ∈ R+), then SQDok becomes a constant multiple off othre α αu ∈sua Rl Hamming distance. As discussed in Sec. 5, this isotropic ok-means is closely related to ITQ [5]. The ok-means AQD between a feature vector x and a cluster index b?, is defined as AQDok(x, b?) = ?x −μ − RDb??22 = ?RTx? − Db??22 + ?R⊥Tx??22 , (15) where x? = x−μ.

Without this term, AQDok becomes a form of asymmetric Hamming (AH) distance between RTx? and b?. While previous work [6] discussed various ad hoc AH distance measures for binary hashing, interestingly, the optimal AH distance for ok-means is derived directly in our model. 333000111977 1M SIFT, 64−bit encoding (k = 264) lRc@aeR0 . 206148 10 RIoPT1Qk K−Q m( AHeDa)Hn )s (AH)10K Figure 2. Euclidean ANN retrieval results for different methods and distance functions on the 1M SIFT dataset. 3.3. Experiments with ok-means Following [7], we report ANN search results on 1M SIFT, a corpus of 128D SIFT descriptors with disjoint sets of 100K training, 1M base, and 10K test vectors. The training set is used to train models. The base set is the database, and the test points are queries. The number of bits m is typically less than p, but no pre-processing is needed for dimensionality reduction. Rather, to initialize learning, R is a random rotation of the first m principal directions of the training data, and μ is the mean of the data. For each query we find R nearest neighbors, and compute Recall@R, the fraction of queries for which the ground-truth Euclidean NN is found in the R retrieved items. Fig. 2 shows the Recall@R plots for ok-means with Hamming (H) ≈ SQDok and asymmetric Hamming (AH) H≡a mAmQiDngok ( Hd)is t≈an SceQ, vs. ITQ [5] and PQ [7]. The PQ ≡met AhoQdD exploits a more complex asymmetric distance func- tion denoted AD ≡ AQDck (defined in Sec. 6. 1). Note first tthioant od ke-nmoeteadns A improves upon ITQ, with both Hamming and asymmetric Hamming distances. This is due to the scaling parameters (i.e., D) in ok-means. If one is interested in Hamming distance efficient retrieval, ok-means is prefered over ITQ. But better results are obtained with the asymmetric distance function. Fig. 2 also shows that PQ achieves superior recall rates. This stems from its joint encoding of multiple feature dimensions. In ok-means, each bit represents a partition ofthe feature space into two clusters, separated by a hyperplane. The intersection of m orthogonal hyperplanes yields 2m regions. Hence we obtain just two clusters per dimension, and each dimension is encoded independently. In PQ, by comparison, multiple dimensions are encoded jointly, with arbitrary numbers of clusters. PQ thereby captures statistical dependencies among different dimensions. We next extend ok-means to jointly encode multiple dimensions. 4. Cartesian k-means In the Cartesian k-means (ck-means) model, each region center is expressed parametrically as an additive combination of multiple subcenters.

Finally, assume that each cluster center, c, is the∈ sum of exactly one element from each subcenter set: = ?C(i)b(i) m c i?= ?1 , (16) where b(i) ∈ H1/h is a 1-of-h encoding. As a conc∈re Hte example (see Fig. 3), suppose we are given 4D inputs, x ∈ R4, and we split each datum into m = 2 parts: z(1) = ?I2 0? x , and Then, suppose w?e z(2) = ?0 I2? x .(17) qu?antize each part, z(?1) and? z(2) , sepa- × rately. As depicted in Fig. 3 (left and middle), we could use h = 5 subcenters for each one. Placing the corresponding subcenters in the columns of 4 5 matrices C(1) and C(2) , C(1)=?d1d20d2×35d4d5?, C(2)=?d?1d?20d2×?35d?4d?5?, we obtain a model (16) that provides 52 possible centers with which to quantize the data. More generally, the total number of model centers is k = hm. Each center is a member of the Cartesian product of the subcenter sets, hence the name Cartesian k-means. Importantly, while the number of centers is hm, the number of subcenters is only mh. The model provides a super-linear number of centers with a linear number of parameters. The learning objective for Cartesian k-means is ?ck-means(C) =x?∈D{b(mi)}inim=1???x −i?=m1C(i)b(i)??22 where b(i) ∈ H1/h, and C ≡ [C(1), ··· , (18) C(m)] ∈ Rp×mh. [b(1)T, ··· ,b(m)T] If we let bT ≡ then the second sum in (18) can be expressed succinctly as Cb. 3While here we assume a fixed cardinality for all subcenter sets, the model is easily extended to allow sets with different cardinalities. 333000112088 The key problem with this formulation is that the min- imization of (18) with respect to the b(i) ’s is intractable. Nevertheless, motivated by orthogonal k-means (Sec. 3), encoding can be shown to be both efficient and exact if we impose orthogonality constraints on the sets of subcenters. To that end, assume that all subcenters in different sets are pairwise orthogonal; i.e., ∀i,j | i = j C(i)TC(j) = 0h×h .(19) Each subcenter matrix C(i) spans a linear subspace of Rp, and the linear subspaces for different subcenter sets do not intersect. Hence, (19) implies that only the subcenters in C(i) can explain the projection of x onto the C(i) subspace. In the example depicted in Fig. 3, the input features are simply partitioned (17), and the subspaces clearly satisfy the orthogonality constraints. It is also clear that C ≡ [ C(1) C(2)] is block diagonal, Iwtit ihs 2 a ×lso o5 c bleloacrks t,h adte Cnote ≡d D(1) and D(]2 i)s . bTlohec quantization error t×he5re bfolorcek bse,c doemnoeste ?x − Cb?22 = ???zz((12))?−?D0(1) D0(2)? ?b ( 21) ? ?2 = ?????z(1)−D(1)b(1)??2+???z(2)−D(2??)b(2)??2. In words, the squa??zred quantization?? erro??r zis the sum of t??he squared errors on the subspaces. One can therefore solve for the binary coefficients of the subcenter sets independently. In the general case, assuming (19) is satisfied, C can be expressed as a product R D, where R has orthonormal columns, and D is block diagonal; i.e., C = R D where Ra=nd[hRe(n1c),e·C(,i)R=(mR)]i,Dan(di).DW=i⎢t⎡⎣⎢hDs0i.(1≡)Dra0(n2)k.

This≡ ≡shRows that, with orthogonality constraints (19), the ck-means encoding problem can be split into m independent sub-encoding problems, one for each subcenter set.

The last column shows the costs given an assumption that C has a rank of s ≥ m. obtain each z(i) , the total encoding cost is O(ps + hs), i.e., O(p2+hp). Alternatively, one could perform NN search in p-dim C(i) ’s, to find the b(i) ’s, which costs O(mhp). Table 1 summerizes the models in terms of their number of centers, index size, and cost of storage and encoding. 4.1. Learning ck-means We can re-write the ck-means objective (18) in matrix form with the Frobenius norm; i.e., ?ck-means(R, D, B) = ? X − RDB ?f2 (22) where the columns of X and B comprise the data points and the subcenter assignment coefficients. The input to the learning algorithm is the training data X, the number of subcenter sets m, the cardinality of the subcenter sets h, and an upper bound on the rank of C, i.e., s. In practice, we also let each rotation matrix R(i) have the same number of columns, i.e., si = s/m. The outputs are the matrices {R(i) } and {D(i) } that provide a local minima of (22).

Relations and related work As mentioned above, there are close mathematical relationships between ok-means, ck-means, ITQ for binary hashing [5], and PQ for vector quantization [7]. It is instructive to specify these relationships in some detail. Iterative Quantization vs. Orthogonal k-means. ITQ [5] is a variant of locality-sensitive hashing, mapping data to binary codes for fast retrieval. To extract m-bit codes, ITQ first zero-centers the data matrix to obtain X?. PCA is then used for dimensionality reduction, fromp down to m dimensions, after which the subspace representation is randomly rotated. The composition of PCA and the random rotation can be expressed as WTX? where W ∈ Rp×m. ITQ then solves for the m×m rotation mawthriex,r eR W, t ∈hatR minimizes ?ITQ(B?, R) = ?RTWTX?− B??f2 , s.t. RTR = Im×m, (23) where B? ∈ {−1, +1}n×p. ITQ ro∈tate {s− t1h,e+ subspace representation of the data to match the binary codes, and then minimizes quantization error within the subspace. By contrast, ok-means maps the binary codes into the original input space, and then considers both the quantization error within the subspace and the out-of-subspace projection error. A key difference is the inclusion of ?R⊥X? ?f2 in the ok-means objective (9). This is important s ?inRce one can often reduce quantization errors by projecting out significant portions of the feature space. Another key difference between ITQ and ok-means is the inclusion of non-uniform scaling in ok-means. This is important when the data are not isotropic, and contributes to the marked improvement in recall rates in Fig. 2. Orthogonal k-means vs. Cartesian k-means. We next show that ok-means is a special case of ck-means with h = 2, where each subcenter set has two elements. To this end, let C(i) = and let b(i) = be the ith subcenter matrix selection vector. Since b(i) is a 1-of-2 encoding (?10? or ?01?), it follows that: [c(1i) c2(i)], b1(i)c(1i)+ b(2i)c2(i) = [b(1i) b2(i)]T c(1i)+2 c2(i)+ bi?c1(i)−2 c2(i), (24) b1(i) − b2(i) where bi? ≡ ∈ {−1, +1}. With the following setting of t≡he bok-m−e abns parameters, μ=?i=m1c1(i)+2c(2i),andC=?c1(1)−2c2(1),...,c1(m)−2c2(m)?, it should be clear that ?i C(i)b(i) = μ + Cb?, where b? ∈ {−1, +1}m, and b??i is the ith bit of b?, used in (24). Similarly, one can also map ok-means parameters onto corresponding subcenters for ck-means. Thus, there is a 1-to-1 mapping between the parameterizations of cluster centers in ok-means and ck-means for h = 2. The benefits of ok-means are its small number of parameters, and its intuitive formulation. The benefit of the ck-means generalization is its joint encoding of multiple dimensions with an arbitrary number of centers, allowing it to capture intrinsic dependence among data dimensions. Product Quantization vs. Cartesian k-means. PQ first splits the input vectors into m disjoint sub-vectors, and then quantizes each sub-vector separately using a subquantizer. Thus PQ is a special case of ck-means where the rotation R is not optimized; rather, R is fixed in both learning and retrieval. This is important because the sub-quantizers act independently, thereby ignoring intrasubspace statistical dependence. Thus the selection of subspaces is critical for PQ [7, 8]. J e´gou et al. [8] suggest using PCA, followed by random rotation, before applying PQ to high-dimensional vectors. Finding the rotation to minimize quantization error is mentioned in [8], but it was considered too difficult to estimate. Here we show that one can find a rotation to minimize the quantization error. The ck-means learning algorithm optimizes sub-quantizers in the inner loop, but they interact in an outer loop that optimizes the rotation (Sec. 4.1). 6. Experiments 6.1. Euclidean ANN search Euclidean ANN is a useful task for comparing quantization techniques. Given a database of ck-means indices, and a query, we use Asymmetric and Symmetric ck-means quantizer distance, denoted AQDck and SQDck. The AQDck between a query x and a binary index b ≡ ?b(1)T, ...,b(m)T?T, derived in (21), is AQDck(x,b) ?m?z(i)−D(i)b(i)?22+ ?R⊥Tx?22.(25) = i?= ?1 ?z(i)−D(i)b(i)?22is the distance between the ithpro- Here, jection?? of x, i.e., z(i) , ?a?nd a subcenter projection from D(i) selecte?d by b(i) .

Once created, tshtoer lookup qtaubelery i-ss pusecedif itoc compare akullp pda tatbablea.se O points etaot tehde, query. So computing AQDck entails m lookups and additions, somewhat more costly than Hamming distance. The last term on the RHS of (25) is irrelevant for NN search. Since PQ is a special case of ck-means with pre-defined subspaces, the same distances are used for PQ (cf. [7]). The SQDck between binary codes b1 and b2 is given by SQDck(b1,b2) = ?m?D(i)b1(i)− D(i)b2(i)?22.(26) i?= ?1 Since b1(i) and b(2i) are 1-of-?h encodings, an m×h?×h lookup table can be createadre t 1o- sft-ohre e nacllo pairwise msu×bh×-dhis ltaonockeusp. 333000222200 1M SIFT, 64−bit encoding (k = 264) 1M GIST, 64−bit encoding (k = 264) 1B SIFT, 64−bit encoding (k = 264) Re@acl0 .4186021RcIPoTQk0−Q m( SAeDaH)n s (SADH)1K0 .1642081 0RIocP1TkQ −K m (SAeDHa)n s (ASHD1)0K .186420 1 R0IoPc1TkQ −KQm( ASe DaHn) s (SADH1)0K Figure 4. Euclidean NN recall@R (number of items retrieved) based on different quantizers and corresponding distance functions on the 1M SIFT, 1M GIST, and 1B SIFT datasets. The dashed curves use symmetric distance. (AH ≡ AQDok, SD ≡ SQDck, AD ≡ AQDck) While the cost of computing SQDck is the same as AQDck, SQDck could also be used to estimate the distance between the indexed database entries, for diversifying the retrieval results, or to detect near duplicates, for example. Datasets. We use the 1M SIFT dataset, as in Sec. 3.3, along with two others, namely, 1M GIST (960D features) and 1B SIFT, both comprising disjoint sets of training, base and test vectors. 1M GIST has 500K training, 1M base, and 1K query vectors. 1B SIFT has 100M training, 1B base, and 10K query points. In each case, recall rates are averaged over queries in test set for a database populated from the base set. For expedience, we use only the first 1M training points for the 1B SIFT experiments. Parameters. In ANN experiments below, for both ckmeans and PQ, we use m = 8 and h = 256. Hence the number of clusters is k = 2568 = 264, so 64-bits are used as database indices. Using h = 256 is particularly attractive because the resulting lookup tables are small, encoding is fast, and each subcenter index fits into one byte. As h increases we expect retrieval results to improve, but encoding and indexing of a query to become slower. Initialization. To initialize the Di’s for learning, as in kmeans, we simply begin with random samples from the set of Zi’s (see Sec. 4.1). To initialize R we consider the different methods that J e´gou et al. [7] proposed for splitting the feature dimensions into m sub-vectors for PQ: (1) natural: sub-vectors comprise consecutive dimensions, (2) structured: dimensions with the same index modulo 8 are grouped, and (3) random: random permutations are used. For PQ in the experiments below, we use the orderings that produced the best results in [7], namely, the structured ordering for 960D GIST, and the natural ordering for 128D SIFT. For learning ck-means, R is initialized to the identity with SIFT corpora. For 1M GIST, where the PQ ordering is significant, we consider all three orderings to initialize R. Results.

PQ and ck-means results using natural (1), structured (2), and random (3) ordering to define the (initial) subspaces. the high-dimensional GIST data, ck-means with AD significantly outperforms other methods; even ck-means with SD performs on par with PQ with AD. On 1M SIFT, the Recall@ 10 numbers for PQ and ck-means, both using AD, × are 59.9% and 63.7%. On 1B SIFT, Recall@ 100 numbers are 56.5% and 64.9%. As expected, with increasing dataset size, the difference between methods is more significant. In 1B SIFT, each feature vector is 128 bytes, hence a total of 119 GB. Using any method in Fig. 4 (including ckmeans) to index the database into 64 bits, this storage cost reduces to only 7.5 GB. This allows one to work with much larger datasets. In the experiments we use linear scan to find the nearest items according to quantizer distances. For NN search using 10K SIFT queries on 1B SIFT this takes about 8 hours for AD and AH and 4 hours for Hamming distance on a 2 4-core computer. Search can be sped up significantly; using a coarse tienri.tia Sl quantization sapnedd an pin svigenritefidfile structure for AD and AH, as suggested by [7, 1], and using the multi-index hashing method of [13] for Hamming distance. In this paper we did not implement these efficiencies as we focus primarily on the quality of quantization. Fig. 5 compares ck-means to PQ when R in ck-means is initialized using the 3 orderings of [7]. It shows that ckmeans is superior in all cases. Simiarly interesting, it also shows that despite the non-convexity ofthe optimization objective, ck-means learning tends to find similarly good encodings under different initial conditions. Finally, Fig. 6 compares the methods under different code dimensionality. 333000222311 1M GIST, encoding with 64, 96, and 128 bits Rl@ace0 .814206 1 R0cP kQ − m1 69e4216a−8 Knb −itsb 1t69248− bit10K Figure 6.

Learning visual codebooks While the ANN seach tasks above require too many clusters for k-means, it is interesing to compare k-means and ck-means on a task with a moderate number of clusters. To this end we consider codebook learning for bag-ofword√s models [3, 10]. We use ck-means with m = 2 and h = √k, and hence k centers. The main advantage of ck- × here is that finding the closest cluster center is done in O(√k) time, much faster than standard NN search with k-means in O(k). Alternatives for k-means, to improve efficiency, include approximate k-means [14], and hierarchical k-means [12]. Here we only compare to exact k-means. CIFAR-10 [9] comprises 50K training and 10K test images (32 32 pixels).

Recognition accuracy rates on the test set for different models and k are given in Table 2. Despite having fewer parameters, ck-means performs on par or better than kmeans. This is consistent for different initializations of the algorithms. Although k-means has higher fedility than ckmeans, with fewer parameters, ck-means may be less susceptible to overfitting. Table 2, also compares with the approach of [19], where PQ without learning a rotation is used for clustering features. As expected, learning the rotation has a significant impact on recognition rates, outperforming all three initializations of PQ. mean√s 7. Conclusions We present the Cartesian k-means algorithm, a generalization of k-means with a parameterization of the clus- ter centers such that number of centers is super-linear in the number of parameters. The method is also shown to be a generalization of the ITQ algorithm and Product Quantization. In experiments on large-scale retrieval and codebook learning for recognition the results are impressive, outperforming product quantization by a significant margin.

<p>Author: Fumin Shen, Chunhua Shen, Qinfeng Shi, Anton van_den_Hengel, Zhenmin Tang</p><p>Abstract: Learning based hashing methods have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may operate. Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes that preserve the Euclidean distance in the original space. Manifold learning techniques, in contrast, are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the original highdimensional data. The complexity of these models, and the problems with out-of-sample data, havepreviously rendered them unsuitable for application to large-scale embedding, however. In this work, we consider how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds. In order to address the above-mentioned difficulties, we describe an efficient, inductive solution to the out-of-sample data problem, and a process by which non-parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method. Our proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available. We particularly show that hashing on the basis of t-SNE [29] outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods on large-scale benchmark datasets, and is very effective for image classification with very short code lengths.</p><p>2 0.94425607 <a title="268-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Monocular_Epipolar_Flow_Estimation.html">362 cvpr-2013-Robust Monocular Epipolar Flow Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Koichiro Yamaguchi, David McAllester, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of computing optical flow in monocular video taken from a moving vehicle. In this setting, the vast majority of image flow is due to the vehicle ’s ego-motion. We propose to take advantage of this fact and estimate flow along the epipolar lines of the egomotion. Towards this goal, we derive a slanted-plane MRF model which explicitly reasons about the ordering of planes and their physical validity at junctions. Furthermore, we present a bottom-up grouping algorithm which produces over-segmentations that respect flow boundaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the challenging KITTI flow benchmark [11] achieving half the error of the best competing general flow algorithm and one third of the error of the best epipolar flow algorithm.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.93996525 <a title="268-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Leveraging_Structure_from_Motion_to_Learn_Discriminative_Codebooks_for_Scalable_Landmark_Classification.html">268 cvpr-2013-Leveraging Structure from Motion to Learn Discriminative Codebooks for Scalable Landmark Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Alessandro Bergamo, Sudipta N. Sinha, Lorenzo Torresani</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new technique for learning a discriminative codebook for local feature descriptors, specifically designed for scalable landmark classification. The key contribution lies in exploiting the knowledge of correspondences within sets offeature descriptors during codebook learning. Feature correspondences are obtained using structure from motion (SfM) computation on Internet photo collections which serve as the training data. Our codebook is defined by a random forest that is trained to map corresponding feature descriptors into identical codes. Unlike prior forest-based codebook learning methods, we utilize fine-grained descriptor labels and address the challenge of training a forest with an extremely large number of labels. Our codebook is used with various existing feature encoding schemes and also a variant we propose for importanceweighted aggregation of local features. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset of 25 landmarks and our new dataset of 620 landmarks (614K images). Our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art in landmark classification. Furthermore, our method is memory efficient and scalable.</p><p>4 0.93354845 <a title="268-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Deep_Convolutional_Network_Cascade_for_Facial_Point_Detection.html">104 cvpr-2013-Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for estimation of the positions of facial keypoints with three-level carefully designed convolutional networks. At each level, the outputs of multiple networks are fused for robust and accurate estimation. Thanks to the deep structures of convolutional networks, global high-level features are extracted over the whole face region at the initialization stage, which help to locate high accuracy keypoints. There are two folds of advantage for this. First, the texture context information over the entire face is utilized to locate each keypoint. Second, since the networks are trained to predict all the keypoints simultaneously, the geometric constraints among keypoints are implicitly encoded. The method therefore can avoid local minimum caused by ambiguity and data corruption in difficult image samples due to occlusions, large pose variations, and extreme lightings. The networks at the following two levels are trained to locally refine initial predictions and their inputs are limited to small regions around the initial predictions. Several network structures critical for accurate and robust facial point detection are investigated. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-ofthe-art methods in both detection accuracy and reliability1.</p><p>5 0.93208265 <a title="268-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Understanding_Indoor_Scenes_Using_3D_Geometric_Phrases.html">446 cvpr-2013-Understanding Indoor Scenes Using 3D Geometric Phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Wongun Choi, Yu-Wei Chao, Caroline Pantofaru, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: Visual scene understanding is a difficult problem interleaving object detection, geometric reasoning and scene classification. We present a hierarchical scene model for learning and reasoning about complex indoor scenes which is computationally tractable, can be learned from a reasonable amount of training data, and avoids oversimplification. At the core of this approach is the 3D Geometric Phrase Model which captures the semantic and geometric relationships between objects whichfrequently co-occur in the same 3D spatial configuration. Experiments show that this model effectively explains scene semantics, geometry and object groupings from a single image, while also improving individual object detections.</p><p>6 0.93171966 <a title="268-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Analyzing_Semantic_Segmentation_Using_Hybrid_Human-Machine_CRFs.html">43 cvpr-2013-Analyzing Semantic Segmentation Using Hybrid Human-Machine CRFs</a></p>

<p>Author: Felix X. Yu, Liangliang Cao, Rogerio S. Feris, John R. Smith, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Attribute-based representation has shown great promises for visual recognition due to its intuitive interpretation and cross-category generalization property. However, human efforts are usually involved in the attribute designing process, making the representation costly to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation to automatically design discriminative “category-level attributes ”, which can be efficiently encoded by a compact category-attribute matrix. The formulation allows us to achieve intuitive and critical design criteria (category-separability, learnability) in a principled way. The designed attributes can be used for tasks of cross-category knowledge transfer, achieving superior performance over well-known attribute dataset Animals with Attributes (AwA) and a large-scale ILSVRC2010 dataset (1.2M images). This approach also leads to state-ofthe-art performance on the zero-shot learning task on AwA.</p><p>3 0.33561742 <a title="293-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Simultaneous_Active_Learning_of_Classifiers_%26_Attributes_via_Relative_Feedback.html">396 cvpr-2013-Simultaneous Active Learning of Classifiers & Attributes via Relative Feedback</a></p>
<p>Author: Arijit Biswas, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Active learning provides useful tools to reduce annotation costs without compromising classifier performance. However it traditionally views the supervisor simply as a labeling machine. Recently a new interactive learning paradigm was introduced that allows the supervisor to additionally convey useful domain knowledge using attributes. The learner first conveys its belief about an actively chosen image e.g. “I think this is a forest, what do you think?”. If the learner is wrong, the supervisorprovides an explanation e.g. “No, this is too open to be a forest”. With access to a pre-trained set of relative attribute predictors, the learner fetches all unlabeled images more open than the query image, and uses them as negative examples of forests to update its classifier. This rich human-machine communication leads to better classification performance. In this work, we propose three improvements over this set-up. First, we incorporate a weighting scheme that instead of making a hard decision reasons about the likelihood of an image being a negative example. Second, we do away with pre-trained attributes and instead learn the attribute models on the fly, alleviating overhead and restrictions of a pre-determined attribute vocabulary. Finally, we propose an active learning framework that accounts for not just the label- but also the attributes-based feedback while selecting the next query image. We demonstrate significant improvement in classification accuracy on faces and shoes. We also collect and make available the largest relative attributes dataset containing 29 attributes of faces from 60 categories.</p><p>4 0.30831972 <a title="293-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Complex_Event_Detection_via_Multi-source_Video_Attributes.html">85 cvpr-2013-Complex Event Detection via Multi-source Video Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhigang Ma, Yi Yang, Zhongwen Xu, Shuicheng Yan, Nicu Sebe, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Complex events essentially include human, scenes, objects and actions that can be summarized by visual attributes, so leveraging relevant attributes properly could be helpful for event detection. Many works have exploited attributes at image level for various applications. However, attributes at image level are possibly insufficient for complex event detection in videos due to their limited capability in characterizing the dynamic properties of video data. Hence, we propose to leverage attributes at video level (named as video attributes in this work), i.e., the semantic labels of external videos are used as attributes. Compared to complex event videos, these external videos contain simple contents such as objects, scenes and actions which are the basic elements of complex events. Specifically, building upon a correlation vector which correlates the attributes and the complex event, we incorporate video attributes latently as extra informative cues into the event detector learnt from complex event videos. Extensive experiments on a real-world large-scale dataset validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p><p>5 0.29686281 <a title="293-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Adding_Unlabeled_Samples_to_Categories_by_Learned_Attributes.html">36 cvpr-2013-Adding Unlabeled Samples to Categories by Learned Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonghyun Choi, Mohammad Rastegari, Ali Farhadi, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to expand the visual coverage of training sets that consist of a small number of labeled examples using learned attributes. Our optimization formulation discovers category specific attributes as well as the images that have high confidence in terms of the attributes. In addition, we propose a method to stably capture example-specific attributes for a small sized training set. Our method adds images to a category from a large unlabeled image pool, and leads to significant improvement in category recognition accuracy evaluated on a large-scale dataset, ImageNet.</p><p>6 0.29276147 <a title="293-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-It%27s_Not_Polite_to_Point%3A_Describing_People_with_Uncertain_Attributes.html">229 cvpr-2013-It's Not Polite to Point: Describing People with Uncertain Attributes</a></p>

<p>Author: Catherine Wah, Serge Belongie</p><p>Abstract: Recent work in computer vision has addressed zero-shot learning or unseen class detection, which involves categorizing objects without observing any training examples. However, these problems assume that attributes or defining characteristics of these unobserved classes are known, leveraging this information at test time to detect an unseen class. We address the more realistic problem of detecting categories that do not appear in the dataset in any form. We denote such a category as an unfamiliar class; it is neither observed at train time, nor do we possess any knowledge regarding its relationships to attributes. This problem is one that has received limited attention within the computer vision community. In this work, we propose a novel ap. ucs d .edu Unfamiliar? or?not?

<p>Author: Amir Sadovnik, Andrew Gallagher, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: Visual attributes are powerful features for many different applications in computer vision such as object detection and scene recognition. Visual attributes present another application that has not been examined as rigorously: verbal communication from a computer to a human. Since many attributes are nameable, the computer is able to communicate these concepts through language. However, this is not a trivial task. Given a set of attributes, selecting a subset to be communicated is task dependent. Moreover, because attribute classifiers are noisy, it is important to find ways to deal with this uncertainty. We address the issue of communication by examining the task of composing an automatic description of a person in a group photo that distinguishes him from the others. We introduce an efficient, principled methodfor choosing which attributes are included in a short description to maximize the likelihood that a third party will correctly guess to which person the description refers. We compare our algorithm to computer baselines and human describers, and show the strength of our method in creating effective descriptions.</p><p>6 0.82534415 <a title="293-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Label-Embedding_for_Attribute-Based_Classification.html">241 cvpr-2013-Label-Embedding for Attribute-Based Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Hyeongwoo Kim, Hailin Jin, Sunil Hadap, Inso Kweon</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method to separate specular reflection from a single image. Separating an image into diffuse and specular components is an ill-posed problem due to lack of observations. Existing methods rely on a specularfree image to detect and estimate specularity, which however may confuse diffuse pixels with the same hue but a different saturation value as specular pixels. Our method is based on a novel observation that for most natural images the dark channel can provide an approximate specular-free image. We also propose a maximum a posteriori formulation which robustly recovers the specular reflection and chromaticity despite of the hue-saturation ambiguity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on real and synthetic examples. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-theart methods in separating specular reflection.</p><p>2 0.85715592 <a title="293-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Accurate_Localization_of_3D_Objects_from_RGB-D_Data_Using_Segmentation_Hypotheses.html">30 cvpr-2013-Accurate Localization of 3D Objects from RGB-D Data Using Segmentation Hypotheses</a></p>
<p>Author: Byung-soo Kim, Shili Xu, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we focus on the problem of detecting objects in 3D from RGB-D images. We propose a novel framework that explores the compatibility between segmentation hypotheses of the object in the image and the corresponding 3D map. Our framework allows to discover the optimal location of the object using a generalization of the structural latent SVM formulation in 3D as well as the definition of a new loss function defined over the 3D space in training. We evaluate our method using two existing RGB-D datasets. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-theart as methods well as a number of baseline approaches for both 3D and 2D object recognition tasks.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.85605198 <a title="293-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-attribute_Queries%3A_To_Merge_or_Not_to_Merge%3F.html">293 cvpr-2013-Multi-attribute Queries: To Merge or Not to Merge?</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad Rastegari, Ali Diba, Devi Parikh, Ali Farhadi</p><p>Abstract: Users often have very specific visual content in mind that they are searching for. The most natural way to communicate this content to an image search engine is to use keywords that specify various properties or attributes of the content. A naive way of dealing with such multi-attribute queries is the following: train a classifier for each attribute independently, and then combine their scores on images to judge their fit to the query. We argue that this may not be the most effective or efficient approach. Conjunctions of attribute often correspond to very characteristic appearances. It would thus be beneficial to train classifiers that detect these conjunctions as a whole. But not all conjunctions result in such tight appearance clusters. So given a multi-attribute query, which conjunctions should we model? An exhaustive evaluation of all possible conjunctions would be time consuming. Hence we propose an optimization approach that identifies beneficial conjunctions without explicitly training the corresponding classifier. It reasons about geometric quantities that capture notions similar to intra- and inter-class variances. We exploit a discrimina- tive binary space to compute these geometric quantities efficiently. Experimental results on two challenging datasets of objects and birds show that our proposed approach can improveperformance significantly over several strong baselines, while being an order of magnitude faster than exhaustively searching through all possible conjunctions.</p><p>4 0.85057902 <a title="293-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminatively_Trained_And-Or_Tree_Models_for_Object_Detection.html">136 cvpr-2013-Discriminatively Trained And-Or Tree Models for Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xi Song, Tianfu Wu, Yunde Jia, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a method of learning reconfigurable And-Or Tree (AOT) models discriminatively from weakly annotated data for object detection. To explore the appearance and geometry space of latent structures effectively, we first quantize the image lattice using an overcomplete set of shape primitives, and then organize them into a directed acyclic And-Or Graph (AOG) by exploiting their compositional relations. We allow overlaps between child nodes when combining them into a parent node, which is equivalent to introducing an appearance Or-node implicitly for the overlapped portion. The learning of an AOT model consists of three components: (i) Unsupervised sub-category learning (i.e., branches of an object Or-node) with the latent structures in AOG being integrated out. (ii) Weaklysupervised part configuration learning (i.e., seeking the globally optimal parse trees in AOG for each sub-category). To search the globally optimal parse tree in AOG efficiently, we propose a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. (iii) Joint appearance and structural parameters training under latent structural SVM framework. In experiments, our method is tested on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2010 detection , benchmarks of 20 object classes and outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.82559556 <a title="293-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_and_Calibrating_Per-Location_Classifiers_for_Visual_Place_Recognition.html">260 cvpr-2013-Learning and Calibrating Per-Location Classifiers for Visual Place Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Petr Gronát, Guillaume Obozinski, Josef Sivic, Tomáš Pajdla</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to localize a query photograph by finding other images depicting the same place in a large geotagged image database. This is a challenging task due to changes in viewpoint, imaging conditions and the large size of the image database. The contribution of this work is two-fold. First, we cast the place recognition problem as a classification task and use the available geotags to train a classifier for each location in the database in a similar manner to per-exemplar SVMs in object recognition. Second, as onlyfewpositive training examples are availablefor each location, we propose a new approach to calibrate all the per-location SVM classifiers using only the negative examples. The calibration we propose relies on a significance measure essentially equivalent to the p-values classically used in statistical hypothesis testing. Experiments are performed on a database of 25,000 geotagged street view images of Pittsburgh and demonstrate improved place recognition accuracy of the proposed approach over the previous work. 2Center for Machine Perception, Faculty of Electrical Engineering 3WILLOW project, Laboratoire d’Informatique de l’E´cole Normale Sup e´rieure, ENS/INRIA/CNRS UMR 8548. 4Universit Paris-Est, LIGM (UMR CNRS 8049), Center for Visual Computing, Ecole des Ponts - ParisTech, 77455 Marne-la-Valle, France</p><p>6 0.82502413 <a title="293-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Active_Contours_with_Group_Similarity.html">33 cvpr-2013-Active Contours with Group Similarity</a></p>

<p>Author: Florent Couzinié-Devy, Jian Sun, Karteek Alahari, Jean Ponce</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of restoring images subjected to unknown and spatially varying blur caused by defocus or linear (say, horizontal) motion. The estimation of the global (non-uniform) image blur is cast as a multilabel energy minimization problem. The energy is the sum of unary terms corresponding to learned local blur estimators, and binary ones corresponding to blur smoothness. Its global minimum is found using Ishikawa ’s method by exploiting the natural order of discretized blur values for linear motions and defocus. Once the blur has been estimated, the image is restored using a robust (non-uniform) deblurring algorithm based on sparse regularization with global image statistics. The proposed algorithm outputs both a segmentation of the image into uniform-blur layers and an estimate of the corresponding sharp image. We present qualitative results on real images, and use synthetic data to quantitatively compare our approach to the publicly available implementation of Chakrabarti et al.

<p>Author: Uwe Schmidt, Carsten Rother, Sebastian Nowozin, Jeremy Jancsary, Stefan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Non-blind deblurring is an integral component of blind approaches for removing image blur due to camera shake. Even though learning-based deblurring methods exist, they have been limited to the generative case and are computationally expensive. To this date, manually-defined models are thus most widely used, though limiting the attained restoration quality. We address this gap by proposing a discriminative approach for non-blind deblurring. One key challenge is that the blur kernel in use at test time is not known in advance. To address this, we analyze existing approaches that use half-quadratic regularization. From this analysis, we derive a discriminative model cascade for image deblurring. Our cascade model consists of a Gaussian CRF at each stage, based on the recently introduced regression tree fields. We train our model by loss minimization and use synthetically generated blur kernels to generate training data. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is efficient and yields state-of-the-art restoration quality on images corrupted with synthetic and real blur.</p><p>4 0.46113464 <a title="198-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-image_Blind_Deblurring_Using_a_Coupled_Adaptive_Sparse_Prior.html">295 cvpr-2013-Multi-image Blind Deblurring Using a Coupled Adaptive Sparse Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Haichao Zhang, David Wipf, Yanning Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a robust algorithm for estimating a single latent sharp image given multiple blurry and/or noisy observations. The underlying multi-image blind deconvolution problem is solved by linking all of the observations together via a Bayesian-inspired penalty function which couples the unknown latent image, blur kernels, and noise levels together in a unique way. This coupled penalty function enjoys a number of desirable properties, including a mechanism whereby the relative-concavity or shape is adapted as a function of the intrinsic quality of each blurry observation. In this way, higher quality observations may automatically contribute more to the final estimate than heavily degraded ones. The resulting algorithm, which requires no essential tuning parameters, can recover a high quality image from a set of observations containing potentially both blurry and noisy examples, without knowing a priorithe degradation type of each observation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world test images clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</p><p>5 0.42488575 <a title="198-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Unnatural_L0_Sparse_Representation_for_Natural_Image_Deblurring.html">449 cvpr-2013-Unnatural L0 Sparse Representation for Natural Image Deblurring</a></p>
<p>Author: Li Xu, Shicheng Zheng, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: We show in this paper that the success of previous maximum a posterior (MAP) based blur removal methods partly stems from their respective intermediate steps, which implicitly or explicitly create an unnatural representation containing salient image structures. We propose a generalized and mathematically sound L0 sparse expression, together with a new effective method, for motion deblurring. Our system does not require extra filtering during optimization and demonstrates fast energy decreasing, making a small number of iterations enough for convergence. It also provides a unifiedframeworkfor both uniform andnon-uniform motion deblurring. We extensively validate our method and show comparison with other approaches with respect to convergence speed, running time, and result quality.</p><p>6 0.39105585 <a title="198-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_3D_Reconstruction_from_Severely_Blurred_Images_Using_a_Single_Moving_Camera.html">108 cvpr-2013-Dense 3D Reconstruction from Severely Blurred Images Using a Single Moving Camera</a></p>

<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Keigo Hirakawa</p><p>Abstract: We propose a notion of double discrete wavelet transform (DDWT) that is designed to sparsify the blurred image and the blur kernel simultaneously. DDWT greatly enhances our ability to analyze, detect, and process blur kernels and blurry images—the proposed framework handles both global and spatially varying blur kernels seamlessly, and unifies the treatment of blur caused by object motion, optical defocus, and camera shake. To illustrate the potential of DDWT in computer vision and image processing, we develop example applications in blur kernel estimation, deblurring, and near-blur-invariant image feature extraction.</p><p>6 0.83393162 <a title="198-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Unnatural_L0_Sparse_Representation_for_Natural_Image_Deblurring.html">449 cvpr-2013-Unnatural L0 Sparse Representation for Natural Image Deblurring</a></p>

Finally, we reconstruct the blur kernel using inverse Radon transform. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our algorithm achieves higher quality results than previous approaches on blurry and noisy images. 1</p><p>2 0.68071115 <a title="198-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Unnatural_L0_Sparse_Representation_for_Natural_Image_Deblurring.html">449 cvpr-2013-Unnatural L0 Sparse Representation for Natural Image Deblurring</a></p>
<p>Author: Li Xu, Shicheng Zheng, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: We show in this paper that the success of previous maximum a posterior (MAP) based blur removal methods partly stems from their respective intermediate steps, which implicitly or explicitly create an unnatural representation containing salient image structures. We propose a generalized and mathematically sound L0 sparse expression, together with a new effective method, for motion deblurring. Our system does not require extra filtering during optimization and demonstrates fast energy decreasing, making a small number of iterations enough for convergence. It also provides a unifiedframeworkfor both uniform andnon-uniform motion deblurring. We extensively validate our method and show comparison with other approaches with respect to convergence speed, running time, and result quality.</p><p>3 0.67657071 <a title="198-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Least_Soft-Threshold_Squares_Tracking.html">267 cvpr-2013-Least Soft-Threshold Squares Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Dong Wang, Huchuan Lu, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generative tracking method based on a novel robust linear regression algorithm. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed Least Soft-thresold Squares (LSS) algorithm models the error term with the Gaussian-Laplacian distribution, which can be solved efficiently. Based on maximum joint likelihood of parameters, we derive a LSS distance to measure the difference between an observation sample and the dictionary. Compared with the distance derived from ordinary least squares methods, the proposed metric is more effective in dealing with outliers. In addition, we present an update scheme to capture the appearance change of the tracked target and ensure that the model is properly updated. Experimental results on several challenging image sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracker achieves more favorable performance than the state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.67176855 <a title="198-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Improving_the_Visual_Comprehension_of_Point_Sets.html">218 cvpr-2013-Improving the Visual Comprehension of Point Sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Sagi Katz, Ayellet Tal</p><p>Abstract: Point sets are the standard output of many 3D scanning systems and depth cameras. Presenting the set of points as is, might “hide ” the prominent features of the object from which the points are sampled. Our goal is to reduce the number of points in a point set, for improving the visual comprehension from a given viewpoint. This is done by controlling the density of the reduced point set, so as to create bright regions (low density) and dark regions (high density), producing an effect of shading. This data reduction is achieved by leveraging a limitation of a solution to the classical problem of determining visibility from a viewpoint. In addition, we introduce a new dual problem, for determining visibility of a point from infinity, and show how a limitation of its solution can be leveraged in a similar way.</p><p>5 0.65837532 <a title="198-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Fully-Connected_Layered_Model_of_Foreground_and_Background_Flow.html">10 cvpr-2013-A Fully-Connected Layered Model of Foreground and Background Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Deqing Sun, Jonas Wulff, Erik B. Sudderth, Hanspeter Pfister, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Layered models allow scene segmentation and motion estimation to be formulated together and to inform one another. Traditional layered motion methods, however, employ fairly weak models of scene structure, relying on locally connected Ising/Potts models which have limited ability to capture long-range correlations in natural scenes. To address this, we formulate a fully-connected layered model that enables global reasoning about the complicated segmentations of real objects. Optimization with fully-connected graphical models is challenging, and our inference algorithm leverages recent work on efficient mean field updates for fully-connected conditional random fields. These methods can be implemented efficiently using high-dimensional Gaussian filtering. We combine these ideas with a layered flow model, and find that the long-range connections greatly improve segmentation into figure-ground layers when compared with locally connected MRF models. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the method can re- cover fine structures and large occlusion regions, with good flow accuracy and much lower computational cost than previous locally-connected layered models.</p><p>6 0.65738338 <a title="198-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Sparse_Subspace_Denoising_for_Image_Manifolds.html">405 cvpr-2013-Sparse Subspace Denoising for Image Manifolds</a></p>

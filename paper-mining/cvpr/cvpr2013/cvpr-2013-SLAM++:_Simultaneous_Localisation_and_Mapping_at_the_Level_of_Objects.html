<p>Author: Nicola Fioraio, Luigi Di_Stefano</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel Semantic Bundle Adjustmentframework whereby known rigid stationary objects are detected while tracking the camera and mapping the environment. The system builds on established tracking and mapping techniques to exploit incremental 3D reconstruction in order to validate hypotheses on the presence and pose of sought objects. Then, detected objects are explicitly taken into account for a global semantic optimization of both camera and object poses. Thus, unlike all systems proposed so far, our approach allows for solving jointly the detection and SLAM problems, so as to achieve object detection together with improved SLAM accuracy.</p><p>3 0.47507808 <a title="372-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_Reconstruction_Using_3D_Object_Shape_Priors.html">111 cvpr-2013-Dense Reconstruction Using 3D Object Shape Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Amaury Dame, Victor A. Prisacariu, Carl Y. Ren, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We propose a formulation of monocular SLAM which combines live dense reconstruction with shape priors-based 3D tracking and reconstruction. Current live dense SLAM approaches are limited to the reconstruction of visible surfaces. Moreover, most of them are based on the minimisation of a photo-consistency error, which usually makes them sensitive to specularities. In the 3D pose recovery literature, problems caused by imperfect and ambiguous image information have been dealt with by using prior shape knowledge. At the same time, the success of depth sensors has shown that combining joint image and depth information drastically increases the robustness of the classical monocular 3D tracking and 3D reconstruction approaches. In this work we link dense SLAM to 3D object pose and shape recovery. More specifically, we automatically augment our SLAMsystem with object specific identity, together with 6D pose and additional shape degrees of freedom for the object(s) of known class in the scene, combining im- age data and depth information for the pose and shape recovery. This leads to a system that allows for full scaled 3D reconstruction with the known object(s) segmented from the scene. The segmentation enhances the clarity, accuracy and completeness of the maps built by the dense SLAM system, while the dense 3D data aids the segmentation process, yieldingfaster and more reliable convergence than when using 2D image data alone.</p><p>4 0.2114545 <a title="372-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Scene_Coordinate_Regression_Forests_for_Camera_Relocalization_in_RGB-D_Images.html">380 cvpr-2013-Scene Coordinate Regression Forests for Camera Relocalization in RGB-D Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Jamie Shotton, Ben Glocker, Christopher Zach, Shahram Izadi, Antonio Criminisi, Andrew Fitzgibbon</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the pose of an RGB-D camera relative to a known 3D scene, given only a single acquired image. Our approach employs a regression forest that is capable of inferring an estimate of each pixel’s correspondence to 3D points in the scene ’s world coordinate frame. The forest uses only simple depth and RGB pixel comparison features, and does not require the computation of feature descriptors. The forest is trained to be capable of predicting correspondences at any pixel, so no interest point detectors are required. The camera pose is inferred using a robust optimization scheme. This starts with an initial set of hypothesized camera poses, constructed by applying the forest at a small fraction of image pixels. Preemptive RANSAC then iterates sampling more pixels at which to evaluate the forest, counting inliers, and refining the hypothesized poses. We evaluate on several varied scenes captured with an RGB-D camera and observe that the proposed technique achieves highly accurate relocalization and substantially out-performs two state of the art baselines.</p><p>5 0.15812626 <a title="372-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-CLAM%3A_Coupled_Localization_and_Mapping_with_Efficient_Outlier_Handling.html">74 cvpr-2013-CLAM: Coupled Localization and Mapping with Efficient Outlier Handling</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Balzer, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method to efficiently generate a model (map) of small-scale objects from video. The map encodes sparse geometry as well as coarse photometry, and could be used to initialize dense reconstruction schemes as well as to support recognition and localization of three-dimensional objects. Self-occlusions and the predominance of outliers present a challenge to existing online Structure From Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping systems. We propose a unified inference criterion that encompasses map building and localization (object detection) relative to the map in a coupled fashion. We establish correspondence in a computationally efficient way without resorting to combinatorial matching or random-sampling techniques. Instead, we use a simpler M-estimator that exploits putative correspondence from tracking after photometric and topological validation. We have collected a new dataset to benchmark model building in the small scale, which we test our algorithm on in comparison to others. Although our system is significantly leaner than previous ones, it compares favorably to the state of the art in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p><p>6 0.15540509 <a title="372-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Mesh_Based_Semantic_Modelling_for_Indoor_and_Outdoor_Scenes.html">284 cvpr-2013-Mesh Based Semantic Modelling for Indoor and Outdoor Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Magnus Burenius, Josephine Sullivan, Stefan Carlsson</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of automatically estimating the 3D pose of humans from images, taken from multiple calibrated views. We show that it is possible and tractable to extend the pictorial structures framework, popular for 2D pose estimation, to 3D. We discuss how to use this framework to impose view, skeleton, joint angle and intersection constraints in 3D. The 3D pictorial structures are evaluated on multiple view data from a professional football game. The evaluation is focused on computational tractability, but we also demonstrate how a simple 2D part detector can be plugged into the framework.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.82662278 <a title="372-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-SLAM%2B%2B%3A_Simultaneous_Localisation_and_Mapping_at_the_Level_of_Objects.html">372 cvpr-2013-SLAM++: Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping at the Level of Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Renato F. Salas-Moreno, Richard A. Newcombe, Hauke Strasdat, Paul H.J. Kelly, Andrew J. Davison</p><p>Abstract: We present the major advantages of a new ‘object oriented’ 3D SLAM paradigm, which takes full advantage in the loop of prior knowledge that many scenes consist of repeated, domain-specific objects and structures. As a hand-held depth camera browses a cluttered scene, realtime 3D object recognition and tracking provides 6DoF camera-object constraints which feed into an explicit graph of objects, continually refined by efficient pose-graph optimisation. This offers the descriptive and predictive power of SLAM systems which perform dense surface reconstruction, but with a huge representation compression. The object graph enables predictions for accurate ICP-based camera to model tracking at each live frame, and efficient active search for new objects in currently undescribed image regions. We demonstrate real-time incremental SLAM in large, cluttered environments, including loop closure, relocalisation and the detection of moved objects, and of course the generation of an object level scene description with the potential to enable interaction.</p><p>3 0.81839097 <a title="372-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Deep_Learning_Shape_Priors_for_Object_Segmentation.html">105 cvpr-2013-Deep Learning Shape Priors for Object Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Chen, Huimin Yu, Roland Hu, Xunxun Zeng</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new shape-driven approach for object segmentation. Given a training set of shapes, we first use deep Boltzmann machine to learn the hierarchical architecture of shape priors. This learned hierarchical architecture is then used to model shape variations of global and local structures in an energetic form. Finally, it is applied to data-driven variational methods to perform object extraction of corrupted data based on shape probabilistic representation. Experiments demonstrate that our model can be applied to dataset of arbitrary prior shapes, and can cope with image noise and clutter, as well as partial occlusions.</p><p>4 0.81551331 <a title="372-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Three-Dimensional_Bilateral_Symmetry_Plane_Estimation_in_the_Phase_Domain.html">432 cvpr-2013-Three-Dimensional Bilateral Symmetry Plane Estimation in the Phase Domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Ramakrishna Kakarala, Prabhu Kaliamoorthi, Vittal Premachandran</p><p>Abstract: We show that bilateral symmetry plane estimation for three-dimensional (3-D) shapes may be carried out accurately, and efficiently, in the spherical harmonic domain. Our methods are valuable for applications where spherical harmonic expansion is already employed, such as 3-D shape registration, morphometry, and retrieval. We show that the presence of bilateral symmetry in the 3-D shape is equivalent to a linear phase structure in the corresponding spherical harmonic coefficients, and provide algorithms for estimating the orientation of the symmetry plane. The benefit of using spherical harmonic phase is that symmetry estimation reduces to matching a compact set of descriptors, without the need to solve a correspondence problem. Our methods work on point clouds as well as large-scale mesh models of 3-D shapes.</p><p>5 0.79706627 <a title="372-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Supervised_Descent_Method_and_Its_Applications_to_Face_Alignment.html">420 cvpr-2013-Supervised Descent Method and Its Applications to Face Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Xuehan Xiong, Fernando De_la_Torre</p><p>Abstract: Many computer vision problems (e.g., camera calibration, image alignment, structure from motion) are solved through a nonlinear optimization method. It is generally accepted that 2nd order descent methods are the most robust, fast and reliable approaches for nonlinear optimization ofa general smoothfunction. However, in the context of computer vision, 2nd order descent methods have two main drawbacks: (1) The function might not be analytically differentiable and numerical approximations are impractical. (2) The Hessian might be large and not positive definite. To address these issues, thispaperproposes a Supervised Descent Method (SDM) for minimizing a Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) function. During training, the SDM learns a sequence of descent directions that minimizes the mean of NLS functions sampled at different points. In testing, SDM minimizes the NLS objective using the learned descent directions without computing the Jacobian nor the Hessian. We illustrate the benefits of our approach in synthetic and real examples, and show how SDM achieves state-ofthe-art performance in the problem of facial feature detec- tion.

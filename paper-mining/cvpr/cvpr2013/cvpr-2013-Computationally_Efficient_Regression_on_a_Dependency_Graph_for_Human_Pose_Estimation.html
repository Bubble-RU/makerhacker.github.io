</p><p>5 Introduction Human pose estimation has been a widely studied topic in the computer vision community. [sent-10, score-0.227]
</p><p>6 Recently, the focus of the community has shifted toward pose estimation from a single still image in cluttered backgrounds. [sent-13, score-0.26]
</p><p>7 Most of the existing methods for pose estimation from a single image, including many state-of-the-art methods, are based on a pictorial structure model, which was first proposed in [1] for general computer vision problems and later applied to the pose estimation problem in [9]. [sent-15, score-0.633]
</p><p>8 The pictorial structure model represents a human body by a combination of body parts with spring-like constrains between those parts to enforce kinematically plausible spatial configurations. [sent-16, score-0.572]
</p><p>9 Despite their successes, pictorial structure models have some problems. [sent-19, score-0.179]
</p><p>10 First, detecting body parts such as limbs, torso and head is challenging in a real-world scenario due to noisy backgrounds, occlusion and variation in appearances and poses. [sent-20, score-0.222]
</p><p>11 Second, it is apparent that a simple pictorial structure model does not produce sufficiently good results and thus many efforts have concentrated on extending the basic pictorial structure model to more complex ones, requiring extensive computations. [sent-22, score-0.358]
</p><p>12 In this paper, we propose a novel solution for the human pose estimation problem, which we call Regression on a Dependency Graph (RoDG). [sent-23, score-0.296]
</p><p>13 Each regressor takes image features computed from an image patch centered on the current node’s position estimated by the previous regressor and is specialized for estimating its child nodes’ positions. [sent-26, score-0.668]
</p><p>14 The use of the dependency graph allows us to decompose a complex pose estimation problem into a set of local pose estimation problems that are much less 333333889088  complex. [sent-27, score-0.674]
</p><p>15 Most regression methods for the human pose estimation task [4, 2, 24] learn a single regressor mapping an image patch containing an entire human body region to all of the pose parameters. [sent-29, score-1.168]
</p><p>16 A drawback of this approach is that image patches have to be large enough to cover all possible poses and thus are dominated by a lot of background regions, making regression problems complex. [sent-30, score-0.238]
</p><p>17 We also propose an importance weighted variant of boosted regression trees for transductive learning settings and demonstrate its effectiveness for the human pose estimation task. [sent-33, score-1.041]
</p><p>18 Related work Many existing approaches to human pose estimation from a still image are based on a pictorial structure model. [sent-35, score-0.475]
</p><p>19 They introduced a score term for representing co-occurrence relations between the mixtures of parts in a scoring function of the pictorial structure model and achieved impressive results. [sent-47, score-0.209]
</p><p>20 Several approaches to human pose estimation from cluttered images that do not use pictorial structure models [22, 11, 14, 2] have been developed. [sent-57, score-0.508]
</p><p>21 [11, 14] extended the Implicit Shape Model of [13] to the human pose estimation task by allowing voting in a pose parameter space. [sent-59, score-0.454]
</p><p>22 Transductive learning was first applied to human pose estimation in [24] where the authors proposed importance weighted variants of kernel regression and twin Gaussian process model to remove the biases in the training set. [sent-60, score-0.72]
</p><p>23 A dependency graph on the key points is manually designed based on the anatomical structure of the human body. [sent-69, score-0.345]
</p><p>24 Each adjacent pair of nodes (i, j) in the graph has the following dependency: pj  = s · fi,j (pi, I,s) + pi  (1)  where iand j are a parent and child node, respectively, s is the scale parameter and fi,j is a function that outputs a vector. [sent-71, score-0.257]
</p><p>25 Each function fi,j is defined as follows: fi,j (pi, I,s) =  gi,j  (h(pi, I,s))  (2)  where gi,j is a regressor and h(pi, I,s) is a predefined function which computes the image features from an image patch centered on pi at scale s. [sent-77, score-0.434]
</p><p>26 Each regressor gi,j is independently trained from a set of images with ground-truth annotations of {p1, . [sent-79, score-0.264]
</p><p>27 Input fitehat gurroeus fdo-rt ueathch a regressor are computed by atnhed same h. [sent-83, score-0.264]
</p><p>28 A target vector for each regressor is the relative location of pj with respect to pi normalized by s and can be computed by solving Eqs. [sent-84, score-0.411]
</p><p>29 (1) and (2) for gi,j : gi,j  (h(pi , I,s)) = (pj − pi)/s  (3)  Note that each regressor gi,j is a multidimensional output regressor as the output is a 2-dimensional vector. [sent-85, score-0.798]
</p><p>30 Furthermore, for a parent node ithat has more than two child 333333889199  nodes {j1, . [sent-86, score-0.166]
</p><p>31 ,jL}, we define a single multidimensional  output regressor th}at, computes an output efo mr eualtcihdi cmheinlds inoondael at once from the same input: gi(·)  = (gi,j1 (·),  . [sent-89, score-0.534]
</p><p>32 1 left, we show an instance of the dependency graph designed for the datasets used in the experiments. [sent-93, score-0.22]
</p><p>33 The non-root nodes of the graph correspond to a set of body joints used to represent a human body pose in the dataset. [sent-94, score-0.615]
</p><p>34 1 right, the red box represents a detection window given by an upper body detector. [sent-96, score-0.253]
</p><p>35 The root node corresponds to the center of the detection window while the other nodes correspond to endpoints of sticks representing a head, torso, upper and lower arms. [sent-97, score-0.418]
</p><p>36 The dependency graph is designed by taking into account the anatomical structure of the human body and also the pose representation adopted by the target datasets. [sent-99, score-0.669]
</p><p>37 For instance, we make both nodes 7 and 8 depend on node 6 in the graph as they represent body points that are close to each other and thus are contained by the image patch centered on p6. [sent-100, score-0.373]
</p><p>38 Designing an optimum dependency graph for a given task is an interesting topic which will be considered in future. [sent-102, score-0.22]
</p><p>39 The details of the training and testing steps on this structure are presented in Section 5. [sent-103, score-0.152]
</p><p>40 Note that RoDG is quite  general and applicable to other tasks such as facial points localization and hand pose estimation by properly designing the dependency graphs. [sent-104, score-0.398]
</p><p>41 Multidimensional  Output  Regression  on  Weighted Training Samples Multidimensional output regression allows us to train a single model that outputs target vectors instead of independently training a single model for each output dimension. [sent-107, score-0.399]
</p><p>42 We denote a set of training samples by {ti, xi}iN=1 , where tW ise a target ave scetto or fa tnrad x nisg an input sve bcyto {r. [sent-108, score-0.157]
</p><p>43 The goal of regression is to learn a function F∗ (x) such  that the expected value of a certain loss function Ψ(t, F(x)) is minimized:  F∗(x) = arFg(mx)inE[Ψ(t,F(x)]  (5)  By approximating the above expected loss by empirical loss, we obtain XN  F∗(x) = arFg(mx)iniX=1wiΨ(ti,F(xi)). [sent-112, score-0.252]
</p><p>44 Multidimensional Output Regression Tree on Weighted Training Samples We propose a multidimensional output regression tree on weighted training samples and use it as a building block for the gradient boosting procedure which is presented in Section 4. [sent-115, score-0.75]
</p><p>45 The multidimensional output regression tree is a non-linear regression model represented as follows: XK  H(x;A,R) =  Xak1(x ∈  rk)  (7)  kX= X1  where 1 is an indicator function, R = {r1, . [sent-117, score-0.689]
</p><p>46 In the training phase, the regression tree is grown by recursively partitioning the input space, starting from a root node which corresponds to the entire input space. [sent-126, score-0.48]
</p><p>47 Multidimensional Output Boosted Regression Trees on Weighted Training Samples A gradient boosting machine [10] is an algorithm to construct a strong regressor from an ensemble of weak regressor. [sent-138, score-0.315]
</p><p>48 In this paper, we use the proposed weighted variant of multidimensional output regression tree as a weak regressor. [sent-139, score-0.576]
</p><p>49 The strong regressor F(x) is expressed as an ensemble of regression trees H: XM  F(x;P) =  X H(x;Am,Rm) mX=  (9)  X0  where P = {Am, Rm}mM=0 represents the set of regression twreheesr’e parameters. [sent-140, score-0.783]
</p><p>50 (6) by sequentially adding a new regression tree H at each stage m, where m = 0 to M. [sent-142, score-0.304]
</p><p>51 At each stage except for m = 0, a set of the parameters of the tree is determined such that the updated model maximally reduces the loss: XN  (Am,Rm) = arAgm,RiniX=1wiΨ(ti,Fm−1(xi)+H(xi;A,R)) (10) Then the learned regression tree is added to the current model, Fm (x) = Fm−1 (x) + H(x; Am , Rm) . [sent-143, score-0.361]
</p><p>52 (11) For m = 0, F0 (x) is the weighted mean target vector of all training samples. [sent-144, score-0.184]
</p><p>53 Choosing the squared error loss function Ψ(t, F(x)) = | |t F(x) | |22 and the weighted regression trees as the weak regressor, we obtain Algorithm 1, where ν is a shrinkage parameter to prevent overfitting. [sent-145, score-0.49]
</p><p>54 Each tree H is trained using residual of each training sample recomputed at each iteration as target vectors. [sent-146, score-0.155]
</p><p>55 Importance Trees  Weighted  Boosted  Regression  In a transductive learning setting, (unlabeled) testing samples are available during the training phase along with labeled training samples. [sent-154, score-0.413]
</p><p>56 When the test samples and training samples are drawn from different probability distributions, the regressor trained solely on the training samples is not optimal for the given test samples. [sent-155, score-0.574]
</p><p>57 One of the possible remedies to this problem is realized by weighting each training sample by an importance weight w such that the new distribution formed by the weighted training samples resembles the distribution of testing samples. [sent-156, score-0.41]
</p><p>58 This is accomplished by setting the importance weight of the i-th training sample as wi = pte (xi)/ptr(xi), where pte and ptr are probability density functions of the testing samples and training samples respectively. [sent-157, score-0.457]
</p><p>59 The proposed weighted variant of the boosted regression trees can work with any method that estimate importance weights. [sent-158, score-0.582]
</p><p>60 Instead of working on the entire testing samples at once, we first cluster the testing samples into several clusters by the k-means algorithm and for each cluster we independently estimate the importance weights and train a regressor. [sent-160, score-0.332]
</p><p>61 This would make the probability density of each cluster simpler and ease the estimation of the importance weights. [sent-161, score-0.139]

</p><p>63 Experiments We tested our algorithm on publicly available datasets for the upper body pose estimation task. [sent-171, score-0.404]
</p><p>64 A body pose is represented by 6 sticks representing a torso, head, upper arms and lower arms (see Fig. [sent-178, score-0.437]
</p><p>65 Both datasets come with detection windows containing upper bodies obtained by an upper body detector. [sent-181, score-0.454]
</p><p>66 The performance is measured only on the images with detection windows, allowing the separation of the human detection task from the pose estimation task. [sent-182, score-0.382]
</p><p>67 As two endpoints of each stick are annotated without consistent ordering, we manually swap two endpoints if necessary. [sent-183, score-0.244]
</p><p>68 1% of the images in the testing set come with detection windows while 95. [sent-188, score-0.269]
</p><p>69 3% come with detection windows obtained by an improved detector in the latest release. [sent-189, score-0.259]
</p><p>70 6% of the images come with detection windows while 75. [sent-193, score-0.202]
</p><p>71 The performance of the pose estimation algorithms is measured using PCP. [sent-196, score-0.227]
</p><p>72 Each body part is represented as a stick and its estimate is considered correct if its endpoints lie within 100t% ofthe length ofthe ground-truth stick from their ground-truth locations. [sent-197, score-0.413]
</p><p>73 Both datasets come with a tool to compute the PCP, however, it was recently pointed out in [15] that the tool does not exactly compute the above defined PCP, leading to erroneously higher PCP. [sent-201, score-0.202]
</p><p>74 As most of the existing works report PCP on the detection windows in the first releases of the dataset using this tool, we also report PCP using the same tool. [sent-202, score-0.193]
</p><p>75 To facilitate future comparison, we also report the correct PCP computed by a fixed version of the tool3 on the updated detection windows provided in the latest releases. [sent-203, score-0.256]
</p><p>76 Implementation Details  ××  In order to obtain the ground-truth of the root node, a set of detection windows containing the annotated upper bodies in the training images are first obtained by running the same upper body detector used to obtain the detection windows for the testing set. [sent-209, score-0.767]
</p><p>77 Detection windows are obtained for 345 out of 472 training images in the Buffy training set4. [sent-211, score-0.241]
</p><p>78 In order to exploit the symmetric structure of the human body, we train a shared regressor for g6,{7,8} and g10,{11,12} by horizontally flipping the training samples for the key points on the right side of the body. [sent-223, score-0.509]
</p><p>79 In the testing time, the same regressor is used for both sides but for the right side both the input patch and output vector need to be horizontally flipped. [sent-224, score-0.454]
</p><p>80 For g1,{2,3,4,5,6,10} , we also double the number of the training samples by appropriately mirroring each training sample. [sent-227, score-0.182]
</p><p>81 For boosted regression trees, the number of the leaves in the regression trees K is set to 5 and the shrinkage parameter ν is set to 0. [sent-228, score-0.652]
</p><p>82 Through cross-validation on the training set, it is observed that the error keeps decreasing as the number of trees increases. [sent-230, score-0.17]
</p><p>83 The regressors are trained on the Buffy training set and the same regressors are used for testing on both Buffy testing set and PASCAL dataset. [sent-232, score-0.281]
</p><p>84 Results As our RoDG works with any multidimensional output regression methods, we also test RoDG with Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) [17], Partial Least Squares (PLS) [6], Lasso [7] and Multivariate RVM (MRVM) [20]. [sent-235, score-0.423]
</p><p>85 The parameters of those regression methods are determined by 5-fold cross validation. [sent-236, score-0.204]
</p><p>86 In Table 1, we show the results on the Buffy dataset evaluated with the PCP tool provided in the dataset and the detection windows in the initial release of the dataset, while  in Table 2, we show the results with the fixed PCP tool and the updated detection windows in the latest release.

In our approach, a dependency graph representing relationships between reference points such as bodyjoints is constructed and thepositions of these reference points are sequentially estimated by a successive application of multidimensional output regressions along the dependency paths, starting from the root node.

Recent methods that rely on discriminatively trained deformable parts organized in a tree model have shown to be very successful in solving this task. Within such a pictorial structure framework, we address the problem of obtaining good part templates by proposing novel, non-linear joint regressors. In particular, we employ two-layered random forests as joint regressors. The first layer acts as a discriminative, independent body part classifier. The second layer takes the estimated class distributions of the first one into account and is thereby able to predict joint locations by modeling the interdependence and co-occurrence of the parts. This results in a pose estimation framework that takes dependencies between body parts already for joint localization into account and is thus able to circumvent typical ambiguities of tree structures, such as for legs and arms. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our body parts dependent joint regressors achieve a higher joint localization accuracy than tree-based state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>3 0.25219697 <a title="89-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Poselet_Conditioned_Pictorial_Structures.html">335 cvpr-2013-Poselet Conditioned Pictorial Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Leonid Pishchulin, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Peter Gehler, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the challenging problem of articulated human pose estimation in still images. We observe that despite high variability of the body articulations, human motions and activities often simultaneously constrain the positions of multiple body parts. Modelling such higher order part dependencies seemingly comes at a cost of more expensive inference, which resulted in their limited use in state-of-the-art methods. In this paper we propose a model that incorporates higher order part dependencies while remaining efficient. We achieve this by defining a conditional model in which all body parts are connected a-priori, but which becomes a tractable tree-structured pictorial structures model once the image observations are available. In order to derive a set of conditioning variables we rely on the poselet-based features that have been shown to be effective for people detection but have so far found limited application for articulated human pose estimation. We demon- strate the effectiveness of our approach on three publicly available pose estimation benchmarks improving or being on-par with state of the art in each case.</p><p>4 0.24525426 <a title="89-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_a_Joint_Pixel-wise_and_Part-wise_Formulation.html">207 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using a Joint Pixel-wise and Part-wise Formulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ľ</p><p>Abstract: Our goal is to detect humans and estimate their 2D pose in single images. In particular, handling cases of partial visibility where some limbs may be occluded or one person is partially occluding another. Two standard, but disparate, approaches have developed in the field: the first is the part based approach for layout type problems, involving optimising an articulated pictorial structure; the second is the pixel based approach for image labelling involving optimising a random field graph defined on the image. Our novel contribution is a formulation for pose estimation which combines these two models in a principled way in one optimisation problem and thereby inherits the advantages of both of them. Inference on this joint model finds the set of instances of persons in an image, the location of their joints, and a pixel-wise body part labelling. We achieve near or state of the art results on standard human pose data sets, and demonstrate the correct estimation for cases of self-occlusion, person overlap and image truncation.</p><p>5 0.17408447 <a title="89-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Class_Generative_Models_Based_on_Feature_Regression_for_Pose_Estimation_of_Object_Categories.html">82 cvpr-2013-Class Generative Models Based on Feature Regression for Pose Estimation of Object Categories</a></p>
<p>Author: Michele Fenzi, Laura Leal-Taixé, Bodo Rosenhahn, Jörn Ostermann</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for learning a class representation that can return a continuous value for the pose of an unknown class instance using only 2D data and weak 3D labelling information. Our method is based on generative feature models, i.e., regression functions learnt from local descriptors of the same patch collected under different viewpoints. The individual generative models are then clustered in order to create class generative models which form the class representation. At run-time, the pose of the query image is estimated in a maximum a posteriori fashion by combining the regression functions belonging to the matching clusters. We evaluate our approach on the EPFL car dataset [17] and the Pointing’04 face dataset [8]. Experimental results show that our method outperforms by 10% the state-of-the-art in the first dataset and by 9% in the second.</p><p>6 0.1713765 <a title="89-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Unconstrained_Monocular_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_by_Action_Detection_and_Cross-Modality_Regression_Forest.html">444 cvpr-2013-Unconstrained Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation by Action Detection and Cross-Modality Regression Forest</a></p>

<p>Author: Kota Hara, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical method for human pose estimation from a single still image. In our approach, a dependency graph representing relationships between reference points such as bodyjoints is constructed and thepositions of these reference points are sequentially estimated by a successive application of multidimensional output regressions along the dependency paths, starting from the root node. Each regressor takes image features computed from an image patch centered on the current node ’s position estimated by the previous regressor and is specialized for estimating its child nodes ’ positions. The use of the dependency graph allows us to decompose a complex pose estimation problem into a set of local pose estimation problems that are less complex. We design a dependency graph for two commonly used human pose estimation datasets, the Buffy Stickmen dataset and the ETHZ PASCAL Stickmen dataset, and demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art results on both datasets with significantly lower computation time than existing methods. Furthermore, we propose an importance weighted boosted re- gression trees method for transductive learning settings and demonstrate the resulting improved performance for pose estimation tasks.</p><p>2 0.92856741 <a title="89-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors.html">206 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using Body Parts Dependent Joint Regressors</a></p>

<p>Author: Fang Wang, Yi Li</p><p>Abstract: Simple tree models for articulated objects prevails in the last decade. However, it is also believed that these simple tree models are not capable of capturing large variations in many scenarios, such as human pose estimation. This paper attempts to address three questions: 1) are simple tree models sufficient? more specifically, 2) how to use tree models effectively in human pose estimation? and 3) how shall we use combined parts together with single parts efficiently? Assuming we have a set of single parts and combined parts, and the goal is to estimate a joint distribution of their locations. We surprisingly find that no latent variables are introduced in the Leeds Sport Dataset (LSP) during learning latent trees for deformable model, which aims at approximating the joint distributions of body part locations using minimal tree structure. This suggests one can straightforwardly use a mixed representation of single and combined parts to approximate their joint distribution in a simple tree model. As such, one only needs to build Visual Categories of the combined parts, and then perform inference on the learned latent tree. Our method outperformed the state of the art on the LSP, both in the scenarios when the training images are from the same dataset and from the PARSE dataset. Experiments on animal images from the VOC challenge further support our findings.</p><p>5 0.85935169 <a title="89-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_Pose_Estimation_Using_Discriminative_Armlet_Classifiers.html">45 cvpr-2013-Articulated Pose Estimation Using Discriminative Armlet Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgia Gkioxari, Pablo Arbeláez, Lubomir Bourdev, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for human pose estimation in real-world cluttered scenes, and focus on the challenging problem of predicting the pose of both arms for each person in the image. For this purpose, we build on the notion of poselets [4] and train highly discriminative classifiers to differentiate among arm configurations, which we call armlets. We propose a rich representation which, in addition to standardHOGfeatures, integrates the information of strong contours, skin color and contextual cues in a principled manner. Unlike existing methods, we evaluate our approach on a large subset of images from the PASCAL VOC detection dataset, where critical visual phenomena, such as occlusion, truncation, multiple instances and clutter are the norm. Our approach outperforms Yang and Ramanan [26], the state-of-the-art technique, with an improvement from 29.0% to 37.5% PCP accuracy on the arm keypoint prediction task, on this new pose estimation dataset.</p><p>6 0.85233831 <a title="89-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-MODEC%3A_Multimodal_Decomposable_Models_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">277 cvpr-2013-MODEC: Multimodal Decomposable Models for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Rui Shi, Wei Zeng, Zhengyu Su, Hanna Damasio, Zhonglin Lu, Yalin Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is an active research field in computer vision, computer graphics and computational geometry. It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquer this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric, so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on the Ricci flow method and the method is general and robust. We apply our algorithm to study constrained human brain surface registration problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic, and achieve relative high performance when evaluated with some popular cortical surface registration evaluation standards.</p><p>2 0.88857579 <a title="89-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_and_Naming_Actors_in_Movies_Using_Generative_Appearance_Models.html">120 cvpr-2013-Detecting and Naming Actors in Movies Using Generative Appearance Models</a></p>

We demonstrate the model on the task of localizing and naming actors in long video sequences. More specifically, the actor’s head and shoulders are each represented as a constellation of optional color regions. Detection can proceed despite changes in view-point and partial occlusions. We explain how to learn the models from a small number of labeled keyframes or video tracks, and how to detect novel appearances of the actors in a maximum likelihood framework. We present results on a challenging movie example, with 81% recall in actor detection (coverage) and 89% precision in actor identification (naming).</p><p>same-paper 3 0.8738237 <a title="89-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Computationally_Efficient_Regression_on_a_Dependency_Graph_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">89 cvpr-2013-Computationally Efficient Regression on a Dependency Graph for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Pushmeet Kohli, Anton Osokin, Stefanie Jegelka</p><p>Abstract: We discuss a model for image segmentation that is able to overcome the short-boundary bias observed in standard pairwise random field based approaches. To wit, we show that a random field with multi-layered hidden units can encode boundary preserving higher order potentials such as the ones used in the cooperative cuts model of [11] while still allowing for fast and exact MAP inference. Exact inference allows our model to outperform previous image segmentation methods, and to see the true effect of coupling graph edges. Finally, our model can be easily extended to handle segmentation instances with multiple labels, for which it yields promising results.</p><p>5 0.85419697 <a title="89-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Unnatural_L0_Sparse_Representation_for_Natural_Image_Deblurring.html">449 cvpr-2013-Unnatural L0 Sparse Representation for Natural Image Deblurring</a></p>

We propose a generalized and mathematically sound L0 sparse expression, together with a new effective method, for motion deblurring. Our system does not require extra filtering during optimization and demonstrates fast energy decreasing, making a small number of iterations enough for convergence. It also provides a unifiedframeworkfor both uniform andnon-uniform motion deblurring. We extensively validate our method and show comparison with other approaches with respect to convergence speed, running time, and result quality.</p><p>6 0.85120833 <a title="89-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Salient_Object_Detection%3A_A_Discriminative_Regional_Feature_Integration_Approach.html">376 cvpr-2013-Salient Object Detection: A Discriminative Regional Feature Integration Approach</a></p>

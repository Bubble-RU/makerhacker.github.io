</p><p>5 Introduction  This paper is concerned with the task of recovering a surface from a collection of images captured from the same position but under different illuminations, a problem known in computer vision as photometric stereo [30]. [sent-12, score-0.632]
</p><p>6 Arguably, one of the most remarkable results has been obtained for the more challenging problem of uncalibrated photometric stereo (UPS), where lights are unknown. [sent-14, score-0.913]
</p><p>7 In this paper, we introduce a novel insight in uncalibrated photometric stereo: There is no ambiguity under the perspective projection model. [sent-25, score-1.112]
</p><p>8 In other words, one can uniquely reconstruct the normals of the object and the lights given only the input images and the camera calibration (focal length and image center). [sent-26, score-0.352]
</p><p>9 Also, under the perspective projection, one can reconstruct the depth map from the normals up to a scale factor. [sent-27, score-0.468]
</p><p>10 When the illumination directions and intensities are known, photometric stereo can be solved as a linear system. [sent-31, score-0.623]
</p><p>11 One of the simplifying assumptions that are typically used (together with the Lambertian image formation model, distant point light sources and ignoring shadows/inter-reflections) is the orthographic projection of the scene onto the image sensor. [sent-32, score-0.526]
</p><p>12 Another example is the work of Tankus and Kiryati [28], which is based on the perspective image formation model introduced in the shape from shading problem [29, 23, 7]. [sent-34, score-0.339]
</p><p>13 Here the partial derivatives of the natural logarithm of the depth map (instead of the depth map itself) are recovered via a closed-form solution based on image ratios. [sent-35, score-0.267]
</p><p>14 How111444777422  ever, such formulation is sensitive to image noise, which may corrupt the estimated gradient map and eventually violate the integrability constraint. [sent-36, score-0.319]
</p><p>15 For this reason, in [17], the same perspective photometric stereo framework is used without the image ratios, but by imposing the integrability constraint in a numerical optimization scheme, similarly to [1]. [sent-37, score-1.182]
</p><p>16 This work differs from classical photometric stereo approaches as the final reconstruction is the fusion of different shape from shading reconstructions, each obtained independently from a single image. [sent-39, score-0.676]
</p><p>17 Other approaches use the perspective projection in hybrid reconstruction algorithms to fuse photometric cues with active stereo [21, 34] or passive stereo [10, 19]. [sent-40, score-1.222]
</p><p>18 When no prior knowledge about the illumination, geom-  ×  etry, and reflectance is available, the problem is called uncalibrated photometric stereo. [sent-42, score-0.672]
</p><p>19 In such case, all prior work assumes an orthographic projection. [sent-43, score-0.215]
</p><p>20 Under this model the normals and lights can be obtained up a 3 3 invertible matrix (9-parameters ambiguity) by computing a singular value decomposition of the data matrix (and by imposing that its rank be 3) [14] . [sent-44, score-0.285]
</p><p>21 If the integrability constraint is imposed, the ambiguity reduces to 3-parameters (the socalled GBR ambiguity) [5]. [sent-45, score-0.412]
</p><p>22 In [25], the GBR ambiguity is solved by grouping normals and albedo based respectively on image appearance and color. [sent-48, score-0.332]
</p><p>23 A recent work [11], solves the ambiguity by introducing the Lambertian Diffuse Reflectance (LDR) maxima and imposing normals and lights to be parallel at those locations. [sent-50, score-0.378]
</p><p>24 Only in [18], the perspective projection is considered to define notions of shadow equivalence and the Generalized Perspective Bas Relief Ambiguity (KGBR). [sent-52, score-0.404]
</p><p>25 Here, it is shown that we cannot obtain additional cues from shadows  (under both orthographic and perspective projection) to solve the GBR ambiguity. [sent-53, score-0.486]
</p><p>26 However, the perspective projection was not incorporated into the image formation model and the corresponding analysis was not done. [sent-54, score-0.458]
</p><p>27 In this work we focus for the first time on uncalibrated photometric stereo under perspective projection. [sent-56, score-1.042]
</p><p>28 Our main contribution is to show that under this model, the problem can be solved unambiguously by imposing only the integrability constraint and to devise a closed-form solution that is simple, efficient and robust. [sent-57, score-0.401]
</p><p>29 Image Formation Model A large set of problems in computer vision, such as photometric stereo, is concerned with measuring geometric and photometric properties of a scene from images. [sent-59, score-0.784]
</p><p>30 A reasonable approximation of this process is the perspective projection model, where 3D points are mapped onto the 2D camera sensor by dividing the first two coordinates by the third one. [sent-63, score-0.485]
</p><p>31 However, because of the nonlinearity of this mapping, the perspective projection is often dropped in lieu of the more linear, and simpler to analyze, orthographic projection. [sent-64, score-0.619]
</p><p>32 As it turns out, the added nonlinearity of the perspective projection is also useful to disambiguate  the uncalibrated photometric stereo solution (see sec. [sent-65, score-1.213]
</p><p>33 The Lambertian model When objects in the scene are Lambertian and the illumination is a distant point light, the measured image irradiance due to a point in space X = [x y z]T ∈ R3 can be written as  I = ρ? [sent-69, score-0.158]
</p><p>34 e,  (1)  where ρ is the albedo of the surface at X, N ∈ S2 is the normal at X, ? [sent-73, score-0.244]
</p><p>35 While the image irradiance I measured at a pixel is of the camera sensor, the normals and the albedo are related to objects in space. [sent-78, score-0.372]
</p><p>36 One can define such mapping as a projection π : R3 → R2 where a pixel (u, v) π(X). [sent-80, score-0.171]
</p><p>37 Then, we can also parametrize the normal map at X as the mapping  =. [sent-84, score-0.147]

</p><p>39 Notice that in our notation we use the convention that both lights and normals point towards the camera (hence, the negative third coordinate). [sent-92, score-0.289]
</p><p>40 (3)  where  (u,v) = π⎝⎛⎣⎡ zˆ(xyx,y)⎦⎤⎠⎞  (4)  denotes the projection of X to the pixel coordinates (u, v) on the image plane. [sent-98, score-0.204]
</p><p>41 Orthographic projection Under the orthographic projection, the pixel coordinates satisfy (u, v) = (x, y). [sent-108, score-0.419]
</p><p>42 (6) Since u ≡ x and v ≡ y, then taking derivatives in x is equivalent to taking derivatives in u and similarly for y and v; hence, zu (u, v) = zx (u, v) zv (u, v) = zy (u, v) . [sent-110, score-0.709]
</p><p>43 Right: When the focal length tends to ∞ then only the camera center shifts to −∞ and the projection becomes orthographic. [sent-127, score-0.362]
</p><p>44 As one can see, when changing the focal length we keep scene and image plane fixed and move only the camera center. [sent-134, score-0.156]
</p><p>45 This model was chosen so that when f → ∞ the perspective projection converges di-  rectly to the orthographic one. [sent-135, score-0.619]
</p><p>46 (5), the image irradiance equation (3) in the perspective case retains the same structure as with the orthographic projection. [sent-137, score-0.567]
</p><p>47 However, now zx (u, v) zu(u, v) and zy (u, v) zv (u, v). [sent-138, score-0.396]
</p><p>48 The form of zx (u, v) and zy (u, v) is obtained in the following proposition. [sent-139, score-0.256]
</p><p>49 1 The derivatives of z with respect to x and y are  f+z+fuzzuu+vzv zy(u, v) = f+z+fuzzvu+vzv  zx(u,v) =  (12)  where zu, zv and z are all functions of (u, v). [sent-141, score-0.211]
</p><p>50 (13)  111444777644  Then, the normal map N can be written again as  N(u,v) ∝⎣⎡pq((−uu,1,vv))⎦⎤ yielding the same irradiance equation as in eq. [sent-149, score-0.266]
</p><p>51 (14)  Remark 1 Notice that the above analysis applied to the perspective projection equation of Tankus and Kiryati [28] yields the same formula that they obtain. [sent-151, score-0.438]
</p><p>52 Uncalibrated Photometric Stereo In the previous sections we have shown that both under the orthographic projection and the perspective projection one can obtain the same imaging equation simply by reparametrizing the normal map. [sent-153, score-0.92]
</p><p>53 If we are given the light directions and intensities, the reconstruction of the normal map via the straightforward matrix pseudo-inverse (·)† is indeed identical in both cases N(u,v) ∝  ? [sent-155, score-0.235]
</p><p>54 (15)  However, when reconstructing the depth map from the normals the differences between the projection models become evident. [sent-168, score-0.406]
</p><p>55 In the case of the orthographic projection we can define N(u, v) use −NN13((uu,,vv))  =  =. [sent-169, score-0.386]
</p><p>56 In the case of the perspective projection  ×  we must instead use NN13((uu,,vv))  =  f+z+−ufzzuu+vzv  and  NN23((uu,,vv))  =  f+z+−ufzzuv+vzv. [sent-171, score-0.404]
</p><p>57 To illustrate another fundamental difference, and the main contribution of this paper, we consider the uncalibrated photometric stereo problem, i. [sent-175, score-0.809]
</p><p>58 hown that the introduction of the surface integrability constraint, which exploits the relationship between the normal map and the derivatives of the depth map, in the orthographic projection case reduces the ambiguities to the so-called Gen? [sent-192, score-0.965]
</p><p>59 the integrability constraint in the perspective projection case leads to the following outcomes: 1. [sent-209, score-0.723]
</p><p>60 Integrability Under Perspective Projection The integrability constraint amounts to imposing that the order with which one takes the derivatives does not matter (as long as the depth map is smooth), i. [sent-214, score-0.532]
</p><p>61 In the case of the orthographic projection this constraint is equivalent to pv (u, v) = qu (u, v), so that the constraints directly applies to the normal map via = In the case of the perspective projection, similarly to [17], we have the following result:  ∂∂vNN13((uu,,vv))  ∂∂uNN23((uu,,vv)). [sent-217, score-0.884]
</p><p>62 1 The integrability constraint zuv holds if and only if the following constraint holds ˆp v = qˆu . [sent-219, score-0.434]
</p><p>63 Since we are interested in using the integrability constraint to relate the entries of the normal map, we use eqs. [sent-224, score-0.415]
</p><p>64 2 Given that the scene does not contain degenerate surfaces,2 the integrability constraint in the case of perspective projection is sufficient to uniquely identify the normals N. [sent-229, score-0.89]
</p><p>65 (18), then we have that N ∝ QTB with Q = [ψ1 ψ2 ψ3]−T, where the ψ1, ψ2, ψ3 solve  and P is the N  P⎡⎣ψψψ213⎦⎤= 0  9 perspective integrability matrix  (23)  P  ×  =. [sent-231, score-0.501]

</p><p>69 Synthetic To validate our analysis we run quantitative experiments (the Matlab code will be publicly available) on images synthetically generated under the perspective model with 3 given surfaces: Random, Pot and Coin (see Fig. [sent-275, score-0.233]

</p><p>73 Our perspective model assumes the focal length and the camera center to be known. [sent-299, score-0.424]

</p><p>77 In the y-axis we show the mean angular error of the reconstructed normal map compared with the ground truth. [sent-321, score-0.208]

<p>Author: Feng Lu, Yasuyuki Matsushita, Imari Sato, Takahiro Okabe, Yoichi Sato</p><p>Abstract: We propose an uncalibrated photometric stereo method that works with general and unknown isotropic reflectances. Our method uses a pixel intensity profile, which is a sequence of radiance intensities recorded at a pixel across multi-illuminance images. We show that for general isotropic materials, the geodesic distance between intensity profiles is linearly related to the angular difference of their surface normals, and that the intensity distribution of an intensity profile conveys information about the reflectance properties, when the intensity profile is obtained under uniformly distributed directional lightings. Based on these observations, we show that surface normals can be estimated up to a convex/concave ambiguity. A solution method based on matrix decomposition with missing data is developed for a reliable estimation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of our method are performed using both synthetic and real-world scenes.</p><p>3 0.21849284 <a title="21-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Calibrating_Photometric_Stereo_by_Holistic_Reflectance_Symmetry_Analysis.html">75 cvpr-2013-Calibrating Photometric Stereo by Holistic Reflectance Symmetry Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhe Wu, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: Under unknown directional lighting, the uncalibrated Lambertian photometric stereo algorithm recovers the shape of a smooth surface up to the generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity. We resolve this ambiguity from the halfvector symmetry, which is observed in many isotropic materials. Under this symmetry, a 2D BRDF slice with low-rank structure can be obtained from an image, if the surface normals and light directions are correctly recovered. In general, this structure is destroyed by the GBR ambiguity. As a result, we can resolve the ambiguity by restoring this structure. We develop a simple algorithm of auto-calibration from separable homogeneous specular reflection of real images. Compared with previous methods, this method takes a holistic approach to exploiting reflectance symmetry and produces superior results.</p><p>4 0.19706 <a title="21-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-view_Photometric_Stereo_with_Spatially_Varying_Isotropic_Materials.html">303 cvpr-2013-Multi-view Photometric Stereo with Spatially Varying Isotropic Materials</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenglong Zhou, Zhe Wu, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to capture both 3D shape and spatially varying reflectance with a multi-view photometric stereo technique that works for general isotropic materials. Our data capture setup is simple, which consists of only a digital camera and a handheld light source. From a single viewpoint, we use a set of photometric stereo images to identify surface points with the same distance to the camera. We collect this information from multiple viewpoints and combine it with structure-from-motion to obtain a precise reconstruction of the complete 3D shape. The spatially varying isotropic bidirectional reflectance distributionfunction (BRDF) is captured by simultaneously inferring a set of basis BRDFs and their mixing weights at each surface point. According to our experiments, the captured shapes are accurate to 0.3 millimeters. The captured reflectance has relative root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 9%.</p><p>5 0.19618632 <a title="21-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-What_Object_Motion_Reveals_about_Shape_with_Unknown_BRDF_and_Lighting.html">465 cvpr-2013-What Object Motion Reveals about Shape with Unknown BRDF and Lighting</a></p>
<p>Author: Manmohan Chandraker, Dikpal Reddy, Yizhou Wang, Ravi Ramamoorthi</p><p>Abstract: We present a theory that addresses the problem of determining shape from the (small or differential) motion of an object with unknown isotropic reflectance, under arbitrary unknown distant illumination, , for both orthographic and perpsective projection. Our theory imposes fundamental limits on the hardness of surface reconstruction, independent of the method involved. Under orthographic projection, we prove that three differential motions suffice to yield an invariant that relates shape to image derivatives, regardless of BRDF and illumination. Under perspective projection, we show that four differential motions suffice to yield depth and a linear constraint on the surface gradient, with unknown BRDF and lighting. Further, we delineate the topological classes up to which reconstruction may be achieved using the invariants. Finally, we derive a general stratification that relates hardness of shape recovery to scene complexity. Qualitatively, our invariants are homogeneous partial differential equations for simple lighting and inhomogeneous for complex illumination. Quantitatively, our framework shows that the minimal number of motions required to resolve shape is greater for more complex scenes. Prior works that assume brightness constancy, Lambertian BRDF or a known directional light source follow as special cases of our stratification. We illustrate with synthetic and real data how potential reconstruction methods may exploit our framework.</p><p>6 0.17819889 <a title="21-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Shading-Based_Shape_Refinement_of_RGB-D_Images.html">394 cvpr-2013-Shading-Based Shape Refinement of RGB-D Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Thoma Papadhimitri, Paolo Favaro</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of reconstructing normals, albedo and lights of Lambertian surfaces in uncalibrated photometric stereo under the perspective projection model. Our analysis is based on establishing the integrability constraint. In the orthographicprojection case, it is well-known that when such constraint is imposed, a solution can be identified only up to 3 parameters, the so-called generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity. We show that in the perspective projection case the solution is unique. We also propose a closed-form solution which is simple, efficient and robust.

Our method uses a pixel intensity profile, which is a sequence of radiance intensities recorded at a pixel across multi-illuminance images. We show that for general isotropic materials, the geodesic distance between intensity profiles is linearly related to the angular difference of their surface normals, and that the intensity distribution of an intensity profile conveys information about the reflectance properties, when the intensity profile is obtained under uniformly distributed directional lightings. Based on these observations, we show that surface normals can be estimated up to a convex/concave ambiguity. A solution method based on matrix decomposition with missing data is developed for a reliable estimation.

<p>Author: Peter Ochs, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Thomas Brox, Thomas Pock</p><p>Abstract: Natural image statistics indicate that we should use nonconvex norms for most regularization tasks in image processing and computer vision. Still, they are rarely used in practice due to the challenge to optimize them. Recently, iteratively reweighed ?1 minimization has been proposed as a way to tackle a class of non-convex functions by solving a sequence of convex ?2-?1 problems. Here we extend the problem class to linearly constrained optimization of a Lipschitz continuous function, which is the sum of a convex function and a function being concave and increasing on the non-negative orthant (possibly non-convex and nonconcave on the whole space). This allows to apply the algorithm to many computer vision tasks. We show the effect of non-convex regularizers on image denoising, deconvolution, optical flow, and depth map fusion. Non-convexity is particularly interesting in combination with total generalized variation and learned image priors. Efficient optimization is made possible by some important properties that are shown to hold.</p><p>3 0.71434796 <a title="21-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Calibrating_Photometric_Stereo_by_Holistic_Reflectance_Symmetry_Analysis.html">75 cvpr-2013-Calibrating Photometric Stereo by Holistic Reflectance Symmetry Analysis</a></p>

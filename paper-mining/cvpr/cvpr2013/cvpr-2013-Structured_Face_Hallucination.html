<p>Author: Brandon M. Smith, Li Zhang, Jonathan Brandt, Zhe Lin, Jianchao Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we propose an exemplar-based face image segmentation algorithm. We take inspiration from previous works on image parsing for general scenes. Our approach assumes a database of exemplar face images, each of which is associated with a hand-labeled segmentation map. Given a test image, our algorithm first selects a subset of exemplar images from the database, Our algorithm then computes a nonrigid warp for each exemplar image to align it with the test image. Finally, we propagate labels from the exemplar images to the test image in a pixel-wise manner, using trained weights to modulate and combine label maps from different exemplars. We evaluate our method on two challenging datasets and compare with two face parsing algorithms and a general scene parsing algorithm. We also compare our segmentation results with contour-based face alignment results; that is, we first run the alignment algorithms to extract contour points and then derive segments from the contours. Our algorithm compares favorably with all previous works on all datasets evaluated.</p><p>3 0.28202954 <a title="415-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_and_Aligning_Faces_by_Image_Retrieval.html">119 cvpr-2013-Detecting and Aligning Faces by Image Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohui Shen, Zhe Lin, Jonathan Brandt, Ying Wu</p><p>Abstract: Detecting faces in uncontrolled environments continues to be a challenge to traditional face detection methods[24] due to the large variation in facial appearances, as well as occlusion and clutter. In order to overcome these challenges, we present a novel and robust exemplarbased face detector that integrates image retrieval and discriminative learning. A large database of faces with bounding rectangles and facial landmark locations is collected, and simple discriminative classifiers are learned from each of them. A voting-based method is then proposed to let these classifiers cast votes on the test image through an efficient image retrieval technique. As a result, faces can be very efficiently detected by selecting the modes from the voting maps, without resorting to exhaustive sliding window-style scanning. Moreover, due to the exemplar-based framework, our approach can detect faces under challenging conditions without explicitly modeling their variations. Evaluation on two public benchmark datasets shows that our new face detection approach is accurate and efficient, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. We further propose to use image retrieval for face validation (in order to remove false positives) and for face alignment/landmark localization. The same methodology can also be easily generalized to other facerelated tasks, such as attribute recognition, as well as general object detection.</p><p>4 0.17683713 <a title="415-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Joint_Geodesic_Upsampling_of_Depth_Images.html">232 cvpr-2013-Joint Geodesic Upsampling of Depth Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Ming-Yu Liu, Oncel Tuzel, Yuichi Taguchi</p><p>Abstract: We propose an algorithm utilizing geodesic distances to upsample a low resolution depth image using a registered high resolution color image. Specifically, it computes depth for each pixel in the high resolution image using geodesic paths to the pixels whose depths are known from the low resolution one. Though this is closely related to the all-pairshortest-path problem which has O(n2 log n) complexity, we develop a novel approximation algorithm whose complexity grows linearly with the image size and achieve realtime performance. We compare our algorithm with the state of the art on the benchmark dataset and show that our approach provides more accurate depth upsampling with fewer artifacts. In addition, we show that the proposed algorithm is well suited for upsampling depth images using binary edge maps, an important sensor fusion application.</p><p>5 0.15637799 <a title="415-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Facial_Feature_Tracking_Under_Varying_Facial_Expressions_and_Face_Poses_Based_on_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines.html">161 cvpr-2013-Facial Feature Tracking Under Varying Facial Expressions and Face Poses Based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Wu, Zuoguan Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: Facial feature tracking is an active area in computer vision due to its relevance to many applications. It is a nontrivial task, sincefaces may have varyingfacial expressions, poses or occlusions. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a face shape prior model that is constructed based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and their variants. Specifically, we first construct a model based on Deep Belief Networks to capture the face shape variations due to varying facial expressions for near-frontal view. To handle pose variations, the frontal face shape prior model is incorporated into a 3-way RBM model that could capture the relationship between frontal face shapes and non-frontal face shapes. Finally, we introduce methods to systematically combine the face shape prior models with image measurements of facial feature points. Experiments on benchmark databases show that with the proposed method, facial feature points can be tracked robustly and accurately even if faces have significant facial expressions and poses.</p><p>6 0.15394941 <a title="415-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Structured_Low-Rank_Representations_for_Image_Classification.html">257 cvpr-2013-Learning Structured Low-Rank Representations for Image Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Xuehan Xiong, Fernando De_la_Torre</p><p>Abstract: Many computer vision problems (e.g., camera calibration, image alignment, structure from motion) are solved through a nonlinear optimization method. It is generally accepted that 2nd order descent methods are the most robust, fast and reliable approaches for nonlinear optimization ofa general smoothfunction. However, in the context of computer vision, 2nd order descent methods have two main drawbacks: (1) The function might not be analytically differentiable and numerical approximations are impractical. (2) The Hessian might be large and not positive definite. To address these issues, thispaperproposes a Supervised Descent Method (SDM) for minimizing a Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) function. During training, the SDM learns a sequence of descent directions that minimizes the mean of NLS functions sampled at different points. In testing, SDM minimizes the NLS objective using the learned descent directions without computing the Jacobian nor the Hessian. We illustrate the benefits of our approach in synthetic and real examples, and show how SDM achieves state-ofthe-art performance in the problem of facial feature detec- tion. The code is available at www. .human sen sin g. . cs . cmu . edu/in t ra fa ce.</p><p>5 0.63072646 <a title="415-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Pose_Robust_Face_Recognition.html">438 cvpr-2013-Towards Pose Robust Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Dong Yi, Zhen Lei, Stan Z. Li</p><p>Abstract: Most existing pose robust methods are too computational complex to meet practical applications and their performance under unconstrained environments are rarely evaluated. In this paper, we propose a novel method for pose robust face recognition towards practical applications, which is fast, pose robust and can work well under unconstrained environments. Firstly, a 3D deformable model is built and a fast 3D model fitting algorithm is proposed to estimate the pose of face image. Secondly, a group of Gabor filters are transformed according to the pose and shape of face image for feature extraction. Finally, PCA is applied on the pose adaptive Gabor features to remove the redundances and Cosine metric is used to evaluate the similarity. The proposed method has three advantages: (1) The pose correction is applied in the filter space rather than image space, which makes our method less affected by the precision of the 3D model; (2) By combining the holistic pose transformation and local Gabor filtering, the final feature is robust to pose and other negative factors in face recognition; (3) The 3D structure and facial symmetry are successfully used to deal with self-occlusion. Extensive experiments on FERET and PIE show the proposed method outperforms state-ofthe-art methods significantly, meanwhile, the method works well on LFW.</p><p>6 0.60700834 <a title="415-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Elastic_Matching_for_Pose_Variant_Face_Verification.html">338 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Elastic Matching for Pose Variant Face Verification</a></p>

Schuler, Harold Christopher Burger, Stefan Harmeling, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: Image deconvolution is the ill-posed problem of recovering a sharp image, given a blurry one generated by a convolution. In this work, we deal with space-invariant non- blind deconvolution. Currently, the most successful meth- ods involve a regularized inversion of the blur in Fourier domain as a first step. This step amplifies and colors the noise, and corrupts the image information. In a second (and arguably more difficult) step, one then needs to remove the colored noise, typically using a cleverly engineered algorithm. However, the methods based on this two-step ap- proach do not properly address the fact that the image information has been corrupted. In this work, we also rely on a two-step procedure, but learn the second step on a large dataset of natural images, using a neural network. We will show that this approach outperforms the current state-ofthe-art on a large dataset of artificially blurred images. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our method in a real-world example with photographic out-of-focus blur.</p><p>3 0.76078361 <a title="415-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Long-Term_Occupancy_Analysis_Using_Graph-Based_Optimisation_in_Thermal_Imagery.html">272 cvpr-2013-Long-Term Occupancy Analysis Using Graph-Based Optimisation in Thermal Imagery</a></p>
<p>Author: Rikke Gade, Anders Jørgensen, Thomas B. Moeslund</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a robust occupancy analysis system for thermal imaging. Reliable detection of people is very hard in crowded scenes, due to occlusions and segmentation problems. We therefore propose a framework that optimises the occupancy analysis over long periods by including information on the transition in occupancy, whenpeople enter or leave the monitored area. In stable periods, with no activity close to the borders, people are detected and counted which contributes to a weighted histogram. When activity close to the border is detected, local tracking is applied in order to identify a crossing. After a full sequence, the number of people during all periods are estimated using a probabilistic graph search optimisation. The system is tested on a total of 51,000 frames, captured in sports arenas. The mean error for a 30-minute period containing 3-13 people is 4.44 %, which is a half of the error percentage optained by detection only, and better than the results of comparable work. The framework is also tested on a public available dataset from an outdoor scene, which proves the generality of the method.</p><p>4 0.73414493 <a title="415-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Linear_Approach_to_Matching_Cuboids_in_RGBD_Images.html">16 cvpr-2013-A Linear Approach to Matching Cuboids in RGBD Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Hao Jiang, Jianxiong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel linear method to match cuboids in indoor scenes using RGBD images from Kinect. Beyond depth maps, these cuboids reveal important structures of a scene. Instead of directly fitting cuboids to 3D data, we first construct cuboid candidates using superpixel pairs on a RGBD image, and then we optimize the configuration of the cuboids to satisfy the global structure constraints. The optimal configuration has low local matching costs, small object intersection and occlusion, and the cuboids tend to project to a large region in the image; the number of cuboids is optimized simultaneously. We formulate the multiple cuboid matching problem as a mixed integer linear program and solve the optimization efficiently with a branch and bound method. The optimization guarantees the global optimal solution. Our experiments on the Kinect RGBD images of a variety of indoor scenes show that our proposed method is efficient, accurate and robust against object appearance variations, occlusions and strong clutter.</p><p>5 0.73032928 <a title="415-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Nonlinearly_Constrained_MRFs%3A_Exploring_the_Intrinsic_Dimensions_of_Higher-Order_Cliques.html">308 cvpr-2013-Nonlinearly Constrained MRFs: Exploring the Intrinsic Dimensions of Higher-Order Cliques</a></p>
<p>Author: Yun Zeng, Chaohui Wang, Stefano Soatto, Shing-Tung Yau</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient approach to integrating non-local statistics into the higher-order Markov Random Fields (MRFs) framework. Motivated by the observation that many non-local statistics (e.g., shape priors, color distributions) can usually be represented by a small number of parameters, we reformulate the higher-order MRF model by introducing additional latent variables to represent the intrinsic dimensions of the higher-order cliques. The resulting new model, called NC-MRF, not only provides the flexibility in representing the configurations of higher-order cliques, but also automatically decomposes the energy function into less coupled terms, allowing us to design an efficient algorithmic framework for maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Based on this novel modeling/inference framework, we achieve state-of-the-art solutions to the challenging problems of class-specific image segmentation and template-based 3D facial expression tracking, which demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>6 0.72968614 <a title="415-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Joint_Model_for_2D_and_3D_Pose_Estimation_from_a_Single_Image.html">14 cvpr-2013-A Joint Model for 2D and 3D Pose Estimation from a Single Image</a></p>

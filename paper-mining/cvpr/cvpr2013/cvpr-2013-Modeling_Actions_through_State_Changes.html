<p>Author: Cheng Li, Kris M. Kitani</p><p>Abstract: We address the task of pixel-level hand detection in the context of ego-centric cameras. Extracting hand regions in ego-centric videos is a critical step for understanding handobject manipulation and analyzing hand-eye coordination. However, in contrast to traditional applications of hand detection, such as gesture interfaces or sign-language recognition, ego-centric videos present new challenges such as rapid changes in illuminations, significant camera motion and complex hand-object manipulations. To quantify the challenges and performance in this new domain, we present a fully labeled indoor/outdoor ego-centric hand detection benchmark dataset containing over 200 million labeled pixels, which contains hand images taken under various illumination conditions. Using both our dataset and a publicly available ego-centric indoors dataset, we give extensive analysis of detection performance using a wide range of local appearance features. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of sparse features and the importance of modeling global illumination. We propose a modeling strategy based on our findings and show that our model outperforms several baseline approaches.</p><p>3 0.16532724 <a title="287-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Context-Aware_Modeling_and_Recognition_of_Activities_in_Video.html">94 cvpr-2013-Context-Aware Modeling and Recognition of Activities in Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Yingying Zhu, Nandita M. Nayak, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury</p><p>Abstract: In thispaper, rather than modeling activities in videos individually, we propose a hierarchical framework that jointly models and recognizes related activities using motion and various context features. This is motivated from the observations that the activities related in space and time rarely occur independently and can serve as the context for each other. Given a video, action segments are automatically detected using motion segmentation based on a nonlinear dynamical model. We aim to merge these segments into activities of interest and generate optimum labels for the activities. Towards this goal, we utilize a structural model in a max-margin framework that jointly models the underlying activities which are related in space and time. The model explicitly learns the duration, motion and context patterns for each activity class, as well as the spatio-temporal relationships for groups of them. The learned model is then used to optimally label the activities in the testing videos using a greedy search method. We show promising results on the VIRAT Ground Dataset demonstrating the benefit of joint modeling and recognizing activities in a wide-area scene.</p><p>4 0.16457875 <a title="287-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-First-Person_Activity_Recognition%3A_What_Are_They_Doing_to_Me%3F.html">175 cvpr-2013-First-Person Activity Recognition: What Are They Doing to Me?</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael S. Ryoo, Larry Matthies</p><p>Abstract: This paper discusses the problem of recognizing interaction-level human activities from a first-person viewpoint. The goal is to enable an observer (e.g., a robot or a wearable camera) to understand ‘what activity others are performing to it’ from continuous video inputs. These include friendly interactions such as ‘a person hugging the observer’ as well as hostile interactions like ‘punching the observer’ or ‘throwing objects to the observer’, whose videos involve a large amount of camera ego-motion caused by physical interactions. The paper investigates multichannel kernels to integrate global and local motion information, and presents a new activity learning/recognition methodology that explicitly considers temporal structures displayed in first-person activity videos. In our experiments, we not only show classification results with segmented videos, but also confirm that our new approach is able to detect activities from continuous videos reliably.</p><p>5 0.14773087 <a title="287-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Detection_of_Manipulation_Action_Consequences_%28MAC%29.html">123 cvpr-2013-Detection of Manipulation Action Consequences (MAC)</a></p>
<p>Author: Yezhou Yang, Cornelia Fermüller, Yiannis Aloimonos</p><p>Abstract: The problem of action recognition and human activity has been an active research area in Computer Vision and Robotics. While full-body motions can be characterized by movement and change of posture, no characterization, that holds invariance, has yet been proposed for the description of manipulation actions. We propose that a fundamental concept in understanding such actions, are the consequences of actions. There is a small set of fundamental primitive action consequences that provides a systematic high-level classification of manipulation actions. In this paper a technique is developed to recognize these action consequences. At the heart of the technique lies a novel active tracking and segmentation method that monitors the changes in appearance and topological structure of the manipulated object. These are then used in a visual semantic graph (VSG) based procedure applied to the time sequence of the monitored object to recognize the action consequence. We provide a new dataset, called Manipulation Action Consequences (MAC 1.0), which can serve as testbed for other studies on this topic. Several ex- periments on this dataset demonstrates that our method can robustly track objects and detect their deformations and division during the manipulation. Quantitative tests prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.</p><p>6 0.12784001 <a title="287-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-An_Approach_to_Pose-Based_Action_Recognition.html">40 cvpr-2013-An Approach to Pose-Based Action Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu Cao, Daniel Barrett, Andrei Barbu, Siddharth Narayanaswamy, Haonan Yu, Aaron Michaux, Yuewei Lin, Sven Dickinson, Jeffrey Mark Siskind, Song Wang</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing human activities in partially observed videos is a challengingproblem and has many practical applications. When the unobserved subsequence is at the end of the video, the problem is reduced to activity prediction from unfinished activity streaming, which has been studied by many researchers. However, in the general case, an unobserved subsequence may occur at any time by yielding a temporal gap in the video. In this paper, we propose a new method that can recognize human activities from partially observed videos in the general case. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a probabilistic framework: 1) dividing each activity into multiple ordered temporal segments, 2) using spatiotemporal features of the training video samples in each segment as bases and applying sparse coding (SC) to derive the activity likelihood of the test video sample at each segment, and 3) finally combining the likelihood at each segment to achieve a global posterior for the activities. We further extend the proposed method to include more bases that correspond to a mixture of segments with different temporal lengths (MSSC), which can better rep- resent the activities with large intra-class variations. We evaluate the proposed methods (SC and MSSC) on various real videos. We also evaluate the proposed methods on two special cases: 1) activity prediction where the unobserved subsequence is at the end of the video, and 2) human activity recognition on fully observed videos. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform existing state-of-the-art comparison methods.</p><p>4 0.87725198 <a title="287-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Spatiotemporal_Deformable_Part_Models_for_Action_Detection.html">408 cvpr-2013-Spatiotemporal Deformable Part Models for Action Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Yicong Tian, Rahul Sukthankar, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: Deformable part models have achieved impressive performance for object detection, even on difficult image datasets. This paper explores the generalization of deformable part models from 2D images to 3D spatiotemporal volumes to better study their effectiveness for action detection in video. Actions are treated as spatiotemporal patterns and a deformable part model is generated for each action from a collection of examples. For each action model, the most discriminative 3D subvolumes are automatically selected as parts and the spatiotemporal relations between their locations are learned. By focusing on the most distinctive parts of each action, our models adapt to intra-class variation and show robustness to clutter. Extensive experiments on several video datasets demonstrate the strength of spatiotemporal DPMs for classifying and localizing actions.</p><p>5 0.87535143 <a title="287-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Poselet_Key-Framing%3A_A_Model_for_Human_Activity_Recognition.html">336 cvpr-2013-Poselet Key-Framing: A Model for Human Activity Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Michalis Raptis, Leonid Sigal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new model for recognizing human actions. An action is modeled as a very sparse sequence of temporally local discriminative keyframes collections of partial key-poses of the actor(s), depicting key states in the action sequence. We cast the learning of keyframes in a max-margin discriminative framework, where we treat keyframes as latent variables. This allows us to (jointly) learn a set of most discriminative keyframes while also learning the local temporal context between them. Keyframes are encoded using a spatially-localizable poselet-like representation with HoG and BoW components learned from weak annotations; we rely on structured SVM formulation to align our components and minefor hard negatives to boost localization performance. This results in a model that supports spatio-temporal localization and is insensitive to dropped frames or partial observations. We show classification performance that is competitive with the state of the art on the benchmark UT-Interaction dataset and illustrate that our model outperforms prior methods in an on-line streaming setting.</p><p>6 0.87010729 <a title="287-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Detection_of_Manipulation_Action_Consequences_%28MAC%29.html">123 cvpr-2013-Detection of Manipulation Action Consequences (MAC)</a></p>

<p>Author: Rikke Gade, Anders Jørgensen, Thomas B. Moeslund</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a robust occupancy analysis system for thermal imaging. Reliable detection of people is very hard in crowded scenes, due to occlusions and segmentation problems. We therefore propose a framework that optimises the occupancy analysis over long periods by including information on the transition in occupancy, whenpeople enter or leave the monitored area. In stable periods, with no activity close to the borders, people are detected and counted which contributes to a weighted histogram. When activity close to the border is detected, local tracking is applied in order to identify a crossing. After a full sequence, the number of people during all periods are estimated using a probabilistic graph search optimisation. The system is tested on a total of 51,000 frames, captured in sports arenas. The mean error for a 30-minute period containing 3-13 people is 4.44 %, which is a half of the error percentage optained by detection only, and better than the results of comparable work. The framework is also tested on a public available dataset from an outdoor scene, which proves the generality of the method.</p><p>2 0.82194752 <a title="287-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Machine_Learning_Approach_for_Non-blind_Image_Deconvolution.html">17 cvpr-2013-A Machine Learning Approach for Non-blind Image Deconvolution</a></p>

In this work, we deal with space-invariant non- blind deconvolution. Currently, the most successful meth- ods involve a regularized inversion of the blur in Fourier domain as a first step. This step amplifies and colors the noise, and corrupts the image information. In a second (and arguably more difficult) step, one then needs to remove the colored noise, typically using a cleverly engineered algorithm. However, the methods based on this two-step ap- proach do not properly address the fact that the image information has been corrupted. In this work, we also rely on a two-step procedure, but learn the second step on a large dataset of natural images, using a neural network. We will show that this approach outperforms the current state-ofthe-art on a large dataset of artificially blurred images. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our method in a real-world example with photographic out-of-focus blur.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.81726378 <a title="287-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Modeling_Actions_through_State_Changes.html">287 cvpr-2013-Modeling Actions through State Changes</a></p>
<p>Author: Alireza Fathi, James M. Rehg</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a model of action based on the change in the state of the environment. Many actions involve similar dynamics and hand-object relationships, but differ in their purpose and meaning. The key to differentiating these actions is the ability to identify how they change the state of objects and materials in the environment. We propose a weakly supervised method for learning the object and material states that are necessary for recognizing daily actions. Once these state detectors are learned, we can apply them to input videos and pool their outputs to detect actions. We further demonstrate that our method can be used to segment discrete actions from a continuous video of an activity. Our results outperform state-of-the-art action recognition and activity segmentation results.</p><p>4 0.80214882 <a title="287-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Structured_Face_Hallucination.html">415 cvpr-2013-Structured Face Hallucination</a></p>
<p>Author: Chih-Yuan Yang, Sifei Liu, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: The goal of face hallucination is to generate highresolution images with fidelity from low-resolution ones. In contrast to existing methods based on patch similarity or holistic constraints in the image space, we propose to exploit local image structures for face hallucination. Each face image is represented in terms of facial components, contours and smooth regions. The image structure is maintained via matching gradients in the reconstructed highresolution output. For facial components, we align input images to generate accurate exemplars and transfer the high-frequency details for preserving structural consistency. For contours, we learn statistical priors to generate salient structures in the high-resolution images. A patch matching method is utilized on the smooth regions where the image gradients are preserved. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm generates hallucinated face images with favorable quality and adaptability.</p><p>5 0.77328295 <a title="287-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-SCaLE%3A_Supervised_and_Cascaded_Laplacian_Eigenmaps_for_Visual_Object_Recognition_Based_on_Nearest_Neighbors.html">371 cvpr-2013-SCaLE: Supervised and Cascaded Laplacian Eigenmaps for Visual Object Recognition Based on Nearest Neighbors</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruobing Wu, Yizhou Yu, Wenping Wang</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing the category of a visual object remains a challenging computer vision problem. In this paper we develop a novel deep learning method thatfacilitates examplebased visual object category recognition. Our deep learning architecture consists of multiple stacked layers and computes an intermediate representation that can be fed to a nearest-neighbor classifier. This intermediate representation is discriminative and structure-preserving. It is also capable of extracting essential characteristics shared by objects in the same category while filtering out nonessential differences among them. Each layer in our model is a nonlinear mapping, whose parameters are learned through two sequential steps that are designed to achieve the aforementioned properties. The first step computes a discrete mapping called supervised Laplacian Eigenmap. The second step computes a continuous mapping from the discrete version through nonlinear regression. We have extensively tested our method and it achieves state-of-the-art recognition rates on a number of benchmark datasets.</p><p>6 0.77326065 <a title="287-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Blessing_of_Dimensionality%3A_High-Dimensional_Feature_and_Its_Efficient_Compression_for_Face_Verification.html">64 cvpr-2013-Blessing of Dimensionality: High-Dimensional Feature and Its Efficient Compression for Face Verification</a></p>

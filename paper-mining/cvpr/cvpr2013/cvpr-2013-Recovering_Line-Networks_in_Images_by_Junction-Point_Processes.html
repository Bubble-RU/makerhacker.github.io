<p>Author: Jan D. Wegner, Javier A. Montoya-Zegarra, Konrad Schindler</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to extract the road network from aerial images. What makes the problem challenging is the complex structure of the prior: roads form a connected network of smooth, thin segments which meet at junctions and crossings. This type of a-priori knowledge is more difficult to turn into a tractable model than standard smoothness or co-occurrence assumptions. We develop a novel CRF formulation for road labeling, in which the prior is represented by higher-order cliques that connect sets of superpixels along straight line segments. These long-range cliques have asymmetric PN-potentials, which express a preference to assign all rather than just some of their constituent superpixels to the road class. Thus, the road likelihood is amplified for thin chains of superpixels, while the CRF is still amenable to optimization with graph cuts. Since the number of such cliques of arbitrary length is huge, we furthermorepropose a sampling scheme which concentrates on those cliques which are most relevant for the optimization. In experiments on two different databases the model significantly improves both the per-pixel accuracy and the topological correctness of the extracted roads, and outper- forms both a simple smoothness prior and heuristic rulebased road completion.</p><p>3 0.21681477 <a title="351-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Reconstructing_Loopy_Curvilinear_Structures_Using_Integer_Programming.html">350 cvpr-2013-Reconstructing Loopy Curvilinear Structures Using Integer Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Ning Zhu, Albert C.S. Chung</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for 3D vessel tree structure segmentation based on a new tubularity Markov tree model ( TMT), which works as both new energy function and graph construction method. With the help of power-watershed implementation [7], a global optimal segmentation can be obtained with low computational cost. Different with other graph-based vessel segmentation methods, the proposed method does not depend on any skeleton and ROI extraction method. The classical issues of the graph-based methods, such as shrinking bias and sensitivity to seed point location, can be solved with the proposed method thanks to vessel data fidelity obtained with TMT. The proposed method is compared with some classical graph-based image segmentation methods and two up-to-date 3D vessel segmentation methods, and is demonstrated to be more accurate than these methods for 3D vessel tree segmentation. Although the segmentation is done without ROI extraction, the computational cost for the proposed method is low (within 20 seconds for 256*256*144 image).</p><p>5 0.13755296 <a title="351-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Deep_Convolutional_Network_Cascade_for_Facial_Point_Detection.html">104 cvpr-2013-Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for estimation of the positions of facial keypoints with three-level carefully designed convolutional networks. At each level, the outputs of multiple networks are fused for robust and accurate estimation. Thanks to the deep structures of convolutional networks, global high-level features are extracted over the whole face region at the initialization stage, which help to locate high accuracy keypoints. There are two folds of advantage for this. First, the texture context information over the entire face is utilized to locate each keypoint. Second, since the networks are trained to predict all the keypoints simultaneously, the geometric constraints among keypoints are implicitly encoded. The method therefore can avoid local minimum caused by ambiguity and data corruption in difficult image samples due to occlusions, large pose variations, and extreme lightings. The networks at the following two levels are trained to locally refine initial predictions and their inputs are limited to small regions around the initial predictions. Several network structures critical for accurate and robust facial point detection are investigated. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-ofthe-art methods in both detection accuracy and reliability1.</p><p>6 0.10455868 <a title="351-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Lagrangian_Relaxation_to_Min-cost_Network_Flow.html">300 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow</a></p>

<p>Author: Marcus A. Brubaker, Andreas Geiger, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose an affordable solution to selflocalization, which utilizes visual odometry and road maps as the only inputs. To this end, we present a probabilistic model as well as an efficient approximate inference algorithm, which is able to utilize distributed computation to meet the real-time requirements of autonomous systems. Because of the probabilistic nature of the model we are able to cope with uncertainty due to noisy visual odometry and inherent ambiguities in the map (e.g., in a Manhattan world). By exploiting freely available, community developed maps and visual odometry measurements, we are able to localize a vehicle up to 3m after only a few seconds of driving on maps which contain more than 2,150km of drivable roads.</p><p>5 0.54100507 <a title="351-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Graph-Based_Optimization_with_Tubularity_Markov_Tree_for_3D_Vessel_Segmentation.html">190 cvpr-2013-Graph-Based Optimization with Tubularity Markov Tree for 3D Vessel Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael Donoser, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we revisit diffusion processes on affinity graphs for capturing the intrinsic manifold structure defined by pairwise affinity matrices. Such diffusion processes have already proved the ability to significantly improve subsequent applications like retrieval. We give a thorough overview of the state-of-the-art in this field and discuss obvious similarities and differences. Based on our observations, we are then able to derive a generic framework for diffusion processes in the scope of retrieval applications, where the related work represents specific instances of our generic formulation. We evaluate our framework on several retrieval tasks and are able to derive algorithms that e. g. achieve a 100% bullseye score on the popular MPEG7 shape retrieval data set.</p><p>2 0.76063228 <a title="351-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Fast_Semidefinite_Approach_to_Solving_Binary_Quadratic_Problems.html">9 cvpr-2013-A Fast Semidefinite Approach to Solving Binary Quadratic Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Wang, Chunhua Shen, Anton van_den_Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Many computer vision problems can be formulated as binary quadratic programs (BQPs). Two classic relaxation methods are widely used for solving BQPs, namely, spectral methods and semidefinite programming (SDP), each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Spectral relaxation is simple and easy to implement, but its bound is loose. Semidefinite relaxation has a tighter bound, but its computational complexity is high for large scale problems. We present a new SDP formulation for BQPs, with two desirable properties. First, it has a similar relaxation bound to conventional SDP formulations. Second, compared with conventional SDP methods, the new SDP formulation leads to a significantly more efficient and scalable dual optimization approach, which has the same degree of complexity as spectral methods. Extensive experiments on various applications including clustering, image segmentation, co-segmentation and registration demonstrate the usefulness of our SDP formulation for solving large-scale BQPs.</p><p>3 0.75327462 <a title="351-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Efficient_and_Exact_MAP-Inference_for_Large_Scale_Discrete_Computer_Vision_Problems_via_Combinatorial_Optimization.html">436 cvpr-2013-Towards Efficient and Exact MAP-Inference for Large Scale Discrete Computer Vision Problems via Combinatorial Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jörg Hendrik Kappes, Markus Speth, Gerhard Reinelt, Christoph Schnörr</p><p>Abstract: Discrete graphical models (also known as discrete Markov random fields) are a major conceptual tool to model the structure of optimization problems in computer vision. While in the last decade research has focused on fast approximative methods, algorithms that provide globally optimal solutions have come more into the research focus in the last years. However, large scale computer vision problems seemed to be out of reach for such methods. In this paper we introduce a promising way to bridge this gap based on partial optimality and structural properties of the underlying problem factorization. Combining these preprocessing steps, we are able to solve grids of size 2048 2048 in less than 90 seconds. On the hitherto unsolva2b04le8 C×h2i0ne4s8e character dataset of Nowozin et al. we obtain provably optimal results in 56% of the instances and achieve competitive runtimes on other recent benchmark problems. While in the present work only generalized Potts models are considered, an extension to general graphical models seems to be feasible.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.74637765 <a title="351-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Recovering_Line-Networks_in_Images_by_Junction-Point_Processes.html">351 cvpr-2013-Recovering Line-Networks in Images by Junction-Point Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Dengfeng Chai, Wolfgang Förstner, Florent Lafarge</p><p>Abstract: The automatic extraction of line-networks from images is a well-known computer vision issue. Appearance and shape considerations have been deeply explored in the literature to improve accuracy in presence of occlusions, shadows, and a wide variety of irrelevant objects. However most existing works have ignored the structural aspect of the problem. We present an original method which provides structurally-coherent solutions. Contrary to the pixelbased and object-based methods, our result is a graph in which each node represents either a connection or an ending in the line-network. Based on stochastic geometry, we develop a new family of point processes consisting in sampling junction-points in the input image by using a Monte Carlo mechanism. The quality of a configuration is measured by a probability density which takes into account both image consistency and shape priors. Our experiments on a variety of problems illustrate the potential of our approach in terms of accuracy, flexibility and efficiency.</p><p>5 0.7212159 <a title="351-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-HDR_Deghosting%3A_How_to_Deal_with_Saturation%3F.html">195 cvpr-2013-HDR Deghosting: How to Deal with Saturation?</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Hu, Orazio Gallo, Kari Pulli, Xiaobai Sun</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for aligning images in an HDR (high-dynamic-range) image stack to produce a new exposure stack where all the images are aligned and appear as if they were taken simultaneously, even in the case of highly dynamic scenes. Our method produces plausible results even where the image used as a reference is either too dark or bright to allow for an accurate registration.</p><p>6 0.68482751 <a title="351-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Constraints_for_Person_Identification_in_Multimedia_Data.html">389 cvpr-2013-Semi-supervised Learning with Constraints for Person Identification in Multimedia Data</a></p>

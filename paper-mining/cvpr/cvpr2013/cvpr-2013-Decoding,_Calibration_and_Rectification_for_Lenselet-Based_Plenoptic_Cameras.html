<p>Author: Filippo Bergamasco, Andrea Albarelli, Emanuele Rodolà, Andrea Torsello</p><p>Abstract: Traditional camera models are often the result of a compromise between the ability to account for non-linearities in the image formation model and the need for a feasible number of degrees of freedom in the estimation process. These considerations led to the definition of several ad hoc models that best adapt to different imaging devices, ranging from pinhole cameras with no radial distortion to the more complex catadioptric or polydioptric optics. In this paper we dai s .unive . it ence points in the scene with their projections on the image plane [5]. Unfortunately, no real camera behaves exactly like an ideal pinhole. In fact, in most cases, at least the distortion effects introduced by the lens should be accounted for [19]. Any pinhole-based model, regardless of its level of sophistication, is geometrically unable to properly describe cameras exhibiting a frustum angle that is near or above 180 degrees. For wide-angle cameras, several different para- metric models have been proposed. Some of them try to modify the captured image in order to follow the original propose the use of an unconstrained model even in standard central camera settings dominated by the pinhole model, and introduce a novel calibration approach that can deal effectively with the huge number of free parameters associated with it, resulting in a higher precision calibration than what is possible with the standard pinhole model with correction for radial distortion. This effectively extends the use of general models to settings that traditionally have been ruled by parametric approaches out of practical considerations. The benefit of such an unconstrained model to quasipinhole central cameras is supported by an extensive experimental validation.</p><p>3 0.23747455 <a title="102-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-The_Variational_Structure_of_Disparity_and_Regularization_of_4D_Light_Fields.html">431 cvpr-2013-The Variational Structure of Disparity and Regularization of 4D Light Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Bastian Goldluecke, Sven Wanner</p><p>Abstract: Unlike traditional images which do not offer information for different directions of incident light, a light field is defined on ray space, and implicitly encodes scene geometry data in a rich structure which becomes visible on its epipolar plane images. In this work, we analyze regularization of light fields in variational frameworks and show that their variational structure is induced by disparity, which is in this context best understood as a vector field on epipolar plane image space. We derive differential constraints on this vector field to enable consistent disparity map regularization. Furthermore, we show how the disparity field is related to the regularization of more general vector-valued functions on the 4D ray space of the light field. This way, we derive an efficient variational framework with convex priors, which can serve as a fundament for a large class of inverse problems on ray space.</p><p>4 0.22714859 <a title="102-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Principal_Observation_Ray_Calibration_for_Tiled-Lens-Array_Integral_Imaging_Display.html">337 cvpr-2013-Principal Observation Ray Calibration for Tiled-Lens-Array Integral Imaging Display</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiming Li, Haitao Wang, Mingcai Zhou, Shandong Wang, Shaohui Jiao, Xing Mei, Tao Hong, Hoyoung Lee, Jiyeun Kim</p><p>Abstract: Integral imaging display (IID) is a promising technology to provide realistic 3D image without glasses. To achieve a large screen IID with a reasonable fabrication cost, a potential solution is a tiled-lens-array IID (TLA-IID). However, TLA-IIDs are subject to 3D image artifacts when there are even slight misalignments between the lens arrays. This work aims at compensating these artifacts by calibrating the lens array poses with a camera and including them in a ray model used for rendering the 3D image. Since the lens arrays are transparent, this task is challenging for traditional calibration methods. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration method based on defining a set of principle observation rays that pass lens centers of the TLA and the camera ’s optical center. The method is able to determine the lens array poses with only one camera at an arbitrary unknown position without using any additional markers. The principle observation rays are automatically extracted using a structured light based method from a dense correspondence map between the displayed and captured . pixels. . com, Experiments show that lens array misalignments xme i nlpr . ia . ac . cn @ can be estimated with a standard deviation smaller than 0.4 pixels. Based on this, 3D image artifacts are shown to be effectively removed in a test TLA-IID with challenging misalignments.</p><p>5 0.19159001 <a title="102-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Globally_Consistent_Multi-label_Assignment_on_the_Ray_Space_of_4D_Light_Fields.html">188 cvpr-2013-Globally Consistent Multi-label Assignment on the Ray Space of 4D Light Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Sven Wanner, Christoph Straehle, Bastian Goldluecke</p><p>Abstract: Wepresent thefirst variationalframeworkfor multi-label segmentation on the ray space of 4D light fields. For traditional segmentation of single images, , features need to be extractedfrom the 2Dprojection ofa three-dimensional scene. The associated loss of geometry information can cause severe problems, for example if different objects have a very similar visual appearance. In this work, we show that using a light field instead of an image not only enables to train classifiers which can overcome many of these problems, but also provides an optimal data structure for label optimization by implicitly providing scene geometry information. It is thus possible to consistently optimize label assignment over all views simultaneously. As a further contribution, we make all light fields available online with complete depth and segmentation ground truth data where available, and thus establish the first benchmark data set for light field analysis to facilitate competitive further development of algorithms.</p><p>6 0.18372752 <a title="102-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Radial_Distortion_Self-Calibration.html">344 cvpr-2013-Radial Distortion Self-Calibration</a></p>

<p>Author: José Henrique Brito, Roland Angst, Kevin Köser, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: In cameras with radial distortion, straight lines in space are in general mapped to curves in the image. Although epipolar geometry also gets distorted, there is a set of special epipolar lines that remain straight, namely those that go through the distortion center. By finding these straight epipolar lines in camera pairs we can obtain constraints on the distortion center(s) without any calibration object or plumbline assumptions in the scene. Although this holds for all radial distortion models we conceptually prove this idea using the division distortion model and the radial fundamental matrix which allow for a very simple closed form solution of the distortion center from two views (same distortion) or three views (different distortions). The non-iterative nature of our approach makes it immune to local minima and allows finding the distortion center also for cropped images or those where no good prior exists. Besides this, we give comprehensive relations between different undistortion models and discuss advantages and drawbacks.</p><p>4 0.82784593 <a title="102-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Can_a_Fully_Unconstrained_Imaging_Model_Be_Applied_Effectively_to_Central_Cameras%3F.html">76 cvpr-2013-Can a Fully Unconstrained Imaging Model Be Applied Effectively to Central Cameras?</a></p>

<p>Author: Dror Sholomon, Omid David, Nathan S. Netanyahu</p><p>Abstract: In thispaper wepropose thefirst effective automated, genetic algorithm (GA)-based jigsaw puzzle solver. We introduce a novel procedure of merging two ”parent” solutions to an improved ”child” solution by detecting, extracting, and combining correctly assembled puzzle segments. The solver proposed exhibits state-of-the-art performance solving previously attempted puzzles faster and far more accurately, and also puzzles of size never before attempted. Other contributions include the creation of a benchmark of large images, previously unavailable. We share the data sets and all of our results for future testing and comparative evaluation of jigsaw puzzle solvers.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78497505 <a title="102-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Decoding%2C_Calibration_and_Rectification_for_Lenselet-Based_Plenoptic_Cameras.html">102 cvpr-2013-Decoding, Calibration and Rectification for Lenselet-Based Plenoptic Cameras</a></p>
<p>Author: Donald G. Dansereau, Oscar Pizarro, Stefan B. Williams</p><p>Abstract: Plenoptic cameras are gaining attention for their unique light gathering and post-capture processing capabilities. We describe a decoding, calibration and rectification procedurefor lenselet-basedplenoptic cameras appropriatefor a range of computer vision applications. We derive a novel physically based 4D intrinsic matrix relating each recorded pixel to its corresponding ray in 3D space. We further propose a radial distortion model and a practical objective function based on ray reprojection. Our 15-parameter camera model is of much lower dimensionality than camera array models, and more closely represents the physics of lenselet-based cameras. Results include calibration of a commercially available camera using three calibration grid sizes over five datasets. Typical RMS ray reprojection errors are 0.0628, 0.105 and 0.363 mm for 3.61, 7.22 and 35.1 mm calibration grids, respectively. Rectification examples include calibration targets and real-world imagery.</p><p>3 0.76524556 <a title="102-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Discovering_the_Structure_of_a_Planar_Mirror_System_from_Multiple_Observations_of_a_Single_Point.html">127 cvpr-2013-Discovering the Structure of a Planar Mirror System from Multiple Observations of a Single Point</a></p>
<p>Author: Ilya Reshetouski, Alkhazur Manakov, Ayush Bandhari, Ramesh Raskar, Hans-Peter Seidel, Ivo Ihrke</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying the position of a viewer inside a room of planar mirrors with unknown geometry in conjunction with the room’s shape parameters. We consider the observations to consist of angularly resolved depth measurements of a single scene point that is being observed via many multi-bounce interactions with the specular room geometry. Applications of this problem statement include areas such as calibration, acoustic echo cancelation and time-of-flight imaging. We theoretically analyze the problem and derive sufficient conditions for a combination of convex room geometry, observer, and scene point to be reconstructable. The resulting constructive algorithm is exponential in nature and, therefore, not directly applicable to practical scenarios. To counter the situation, we propose theoretically devised geometric constraints that enable an efficient pruning of the solution space and develop a heuristic randomized search algorithm that uses these constraints to obtain an effective solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on extensive simulations as well as in a challenging real-world calibration scenario.</p><p>4 0.68710655 <a title="102-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Single_Image_Calibration_of_Multi-axial_Imaging_Systems.html">400 cvpr-2013-Single Image Calibration of Multi-axial Imaging Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Agrawal, Srikumar Ramalingam</p><p>Abstract: Imaging systems consisting of a camera looking at multiple spherical mirrors (reflection) or multiple refractive spheres (refraction) have been used for wide-angle imaging applications. We describe such setups as multi-axial imaging systems, since a single sphere results in an axial system. Assuming an internally calibrated camera, calibration of such multi-axial systems involves estimating the sphere radii and locations in the camera coordinate system. However, previous calibration approaches require manual intervention or constrained setups. We present a fully automatic approach using a single photo of a 2D calibration grid. The pose of the calibration grid is assumed to be unknown and is also recovered. Our approach can handle unconstrained setups, where the mirrors/refractive balls can be arranged in any fashion, not necessarily on a grid. The axial nature of rays allows us to compute the axis of each sphere separately. We then show that by choosing rays from two or more spheres, the unknown pose of the calibration grid can be obtained linearly and independently of sphere radii and locations. Knowing the pose, we derive analytical solutions for obtaining the sphere radius and location. This leads to an interesting result that 6-DOF pose estimation of a multi-axial camera can be done without the knowledge of full calibration. Simulations and real experiments demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm.</p><p>5 0.68511373 <a title="102-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Plane-Based_Content_Preserving_Warps_for_Video_Stabilization.html">333 cvpr-2013-Plane-Based Content Preserving Warps for Video Stabilization</a></p>
<p>Author: Zihan Zhou, Hailin Jin, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Recently, a new image deformation technique called content-preserving warping (CPW) has been successfully employed to produce the state-of-the-art video stabilization results in many challenging cases. The key insight of CPW is that the true image deformation due to viewpoint change can be well approximated by a carefully constructed warp using a set of sparsely constructed 3D points only. However, since CPW solely relies on the tracked feature points to guide the warping, it works poorly in large textureless regions, such as ground and building interiors. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we present a hybrid approach for novel view synthesis, observing that the textureless regions often correspond to large planar surfaces in the scene. Particularly, given a jittery video, we first segment each frame into piecewise planar regions as well as regions labeled as non-planar using Markov random fields. Then, a new warp is computed by estimating a single homography for regions belong to the same plane, while in- heriting results from CPW in the non-planar regions. We demonstrate how the segmentation information can be efficiently obtained and seamlessly integrated into the stabilization framework. Experimental results on a variety of real video sequences verify the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>6 0.68474066 <a title="102-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Axially_Symmetric_3D_Pots_Configuration_System_Using_Axis_of_Symmetry_and_Break_Curve.html">52 cvpr-2013-Axially Symmetric 3D Pots Configuration System Using Axis of Symmetry and Break Curve</a></p>

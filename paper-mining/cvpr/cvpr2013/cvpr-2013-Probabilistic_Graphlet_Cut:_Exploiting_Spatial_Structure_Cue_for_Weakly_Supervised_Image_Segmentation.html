<p>Author: Guang Shu, Afshin Dehghan, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to improve the detection performance of a generic detector when it is applied to a particular video. The performance of offline-trained objects detectors are usually degraded in unconstrained video environments due to variant illuminations, backgrounds and camera viewpoints. Moreover, most object detectors are trained using Haar-like features or gradient features but ignore video specificfeatures like consistent colorpatterns. In our approach, we apply a Superpixel-based Bag-of-Words (BoW) model to iteratively refine the output of a generic detector. Compared to other related work, our method builds a video-specific detector using superpixels, hence it can handle the problem of appearance variation. Most importantly, using Conditional Random Field (CRF) along with our super pixel-based BoW model, we develop and algorithm to segment the object from the background . Therefore our method generates an output of the exact object regions instead of the bounding boxes generated by most detectors. In general, our method takes detection bounding boxes of a generic detector as input and generates the detection output with higher average precision and precise object regions. The experiments on four recent datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and significantly improves the state-of-art detector by 5-16% in average precision.</p><p>3 0.15458104 <a title="339-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Label_Propagation_from_ImageNet_to_3D_Point_Clouds.html">242 cvpr-2013-Label Propagation from ImageNet to 3D Point Clouds</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Wang, Rongrong Ji, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in understanding the semantics of point clouds in a wide variety of applications. However, point cloud labeling remains an open problem, due to the difficulty in acquiring sufficient 3D point labels towards training effective classifiers. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by utilizing the existing massive 2D semantic labeled datasets from decadelong community efforts, such as ImageNet and LabelMe, and a novel “cross-domain ” label propagation approach. Our proposed method consists of two major novel components, Exemplar SVM based label propagation, which effectively addresses the cross-domain issue, and a graphical model based contextual refinement incorporating 3D constraints. Most importantly, the entire process does not require any training data from the target scenes, also with good scalability towards large scale applications. We evaluate our approach on the well-known Cornell Point Cloud Dataset, achieving much greater efficiency and comparable accuracy even without any 3D training data. Our approach shows further major gains in accuracy when the training data from the target scenes is used, outperforming state-ofthe-art approaches with far better efficiency.</p><p>4 0.14737843 <a title="339-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Video_Representation_Using_Temporal_Superpixels.html">29 cvpr-2013-A Video Representation Using Temporal Superpixels</a></p>

We learn the relevance of individual feature channels at test time using a locally adaptive distance metric. To further improve the accuracy of the nonparametric approach, we examine the importance of the retrieval set used to compute the nearest neighbours using a novel semantic descriptor to retrieve better candidates. The approach is validated by experiments on several datasets used for semantic parsing demonstrating the superiority of the method compared to the state of art approaches.</p><p>6 0.12971966 <a title="339-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Weakly-Supervised_Dual_Clustering_for_Image_Semantic_Segmentation.html">460 cvpr-2013-Weakly-Supervised Dual Clustering for Image Semantic Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaobai Liu, Liang Lin, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient multi-scale low-rank representation for image segmentation. Our method begins with partitioning the input images into a set of superpixels, followed by seeking the optimal superpixel-pair affinity matrix, both of which are performed at multiple scales of the input images. Since low-level superpixel features are usually corrupted by image noises, we propose to infer the low-rank refined affinity matrix. The inference is guided by two observations on natural images. First, looking into a single image, local small-size image patterns tend to recur frequently within the same semantic region, but may not appear in semantically different regions. We call this internal image statistics as replication prior, and quantitatively justify it on real image databases. Second, the affinity matrices at different scales should be consistently solved, which leads to the cross-scale consistency constraint. We formulate these two purposes with one unified formulation and develop an efficient optimization procedure. Our experiments demonstrate the presented method can substantially improve segmentation accuracy.</p><p>4 0.77458084 <a title="339-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Label_Propagation_from_ImageNet_to_3D_Point_Clouds.html">242 cvpr-2013-Label Propagation from ImageNet to 3D Point Clouds</a></p>

<p>Author: Asma Rejeb Sfar, Nozha Boujemaa, Donald Geman</p><p>Abstract: We study fine-grained categorization, the task of distinguishing among (sub)categories of the same generic object class (e.g., birds), focusing on determining botanical species (leaves and orchids) from scanned images. The strategy is to focus attention around several vantage points, which is the approach taken by botanists, but using features dedicated to the individual categories. Our implementation of the strategy is based on vantage feature frames, a novel object representation consisting of two components: a set of coordinate systems centered at the most discriminating local viewpoints for the generic object class and a set of category-dependentfeatures computed in these frames. The features are pooled over frames to build the classifier. Categorization then proceeds from coarse-grained (finding the frames) to fine-grained (finding the category), and hence the vantage feature frames must be both detectable and discriminating. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the art algorithms, in particular those using more distributed representations, on standard databases of leaves.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.6672737 <a title="339-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Graphlet_Cut%3A_Exploiting_Spatial_Structure_Cue_for_Weakly_Supervised_Image_Segmentation.html">339 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Graphlet Cut: Exploiting Spatial Structure Cue for Weakly Supervised Image Segmentation</a></p>

Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks). We give an extensive set of comparison results on a large shape segmentation benchmark and derive a uniqueness theorem for the surface alignment problem.</p><p>4 0.60856825 <a title="339-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Motion_Estimation_for_Self-Driving_Cars_with_a_Generalized_Camera.html">290 cvpr-2013-Motion Estimation for Self-Driving Cars with a Generalized Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Gim Hee Lee, Friedrich Faundorfer, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a visual ego-motion estimation algorithm for a self-driving car equipped with a closeto-market multi-camera system. By modeling the multicamera system as a generalized camera and applying the non-holonomic motion constraint of a car, we show that this leads to a novel 2-point minimal solution for the generalized essential matrix where the full relative motion including metric scale can be obtained. We provide the analytical solutions for the general case with at least one inter-camera correspondence and a special case with only intra-camera correspondences. We show that up to a maximum of 6 solutions exist for both cases. We identify the existence of degeneracy when the car undergoes straight motion in the special case with only intra-camera correspondences where the scale becomes unobservable and provide a practical alternative solution. Our formulation can be efficiently implemented within RANSAC for robust estimation. We verify the validity of our assumptions on the motion model by comparing our results on a large real-world dataset collected by a car equipped with 4 cameras with minimal overlapping field-of-views against the GPS/INS ground truth.</p><p>5 0.59996462 <a title="339-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Scene_Parsing_by_Integrating_Function%2C_Geometry_and_Appearance_Models.html">381 cvpr-2013-Scene Parsing by Integrating Function, Geometry and Appearance Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Yibiao Zhao, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Indoor functional objects exhibit large view and appearance variations, thus are difficult to be recognized by the traditional appearance-based classification paradigm. In this paper, we present an algorithm to parse indoor images based on two observations: i) The functionality is the most essentialproperty to define an indoor object, e.g. “a chair to sit on ”; ii) The geometry (3D shape) ofan object is designed to serve its function. We formulate the nature of the object function into a stochastic grammar model. This model characterizes a joint distribution over the function-geometryappearance (FGA) hierarchy. The hierarchical structure includes a scene category, , functional groups, , functional objects, functional parts and 3D geometric shapes. We use a simulated annealing MCMC algorithm to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution, i.e. a parse tree. We design four data-driven steps to accelerate the search in the FGA space: i) group the line segments into 3D primitive shapes, ii) assign functional labels to these 3D primitive shapes, iii) fill in missing objects/parts according to the functional labels, and iv) synthesize 2D segmentation maps and verify the current parse tree by the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability. The experimental results on several challenging indoor datasets demonstrate theproposed approach not only significantly widens the scope ofindoor sceneparsing algorithm from the segmentation and the 3D recovery to the functional object recognition, but also yields improved overall performance.</p><p>6 0.59694314 <a title="339-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Video_Editing_with_Temporal%2C_Spatial_and_Appearance_Consistency.html">453 cvpr-2013-Video Editing with Temporal, Spatial and Appearance Consistency</a></p>

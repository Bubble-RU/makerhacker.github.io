<p>Author: Raviteja Vemulapalli, Jaishanker K. Pillai, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: In computer vision applications, features often lie on Riemannian manifolds with known geometry. Popular learning algorithms such as discriminant analysis, partial least squares, support vector machines, etc., are not directly applicable to such features due to the non-Euclidean nature of the underlying spaces. Hence, classification is often performed in an extrinsic manner by mapping the manifolds to Euclidean spaces using kernels. However, for kernel based approaches, poor choice of kernel often results in reduced performance. In this paper, we address the issue of kernelselection for the classification of features that lie on Riemannian manifolds using the kernel learning approach. We propose two criteria for jointly learning the kernel and the classifier using a single optimization problem. Specifically, for the SVM classifier, we formulate the problem of learning a good kernel-classifier combination as a convex optimization problem and solve it efficiently following the multiple kernel learning approach. Experimental results on image set-based classification and activity recognition clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods for classification of manifold features.</p><p>3 0.20547278 <a title="276-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Rolling_Riemannian_Manifolds_to_Solve_the_Multi-class_Classification_Problem.html">367 cvpr-2013-Rolling Riemannian Manifolds to Solve the Multi-class Classification Problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Caseiro, Pedro Martins, João F. Henriques, Fátima Silva Leite, Jorge Batista</p><p>Abstract: In the past few years there has been a growing interest on geometric frameworks to learn supervised classification models on Riemannian manifolds [31, 27]. A popular framework, valid over any Riemannian manifold, was proposed in [31] for binary classification. Once moving from binary to multi-class classification thisparadigm is not valid anymore, due to the spread of multiple positive classes on the manifold [27]. It is then natural to ask whether the multi-class paradigm could be extended to operate on a large class of Riemannian manifolds. We propose a mathematically well-founded classification paradigm that allows to extend the work in [31] to multi-class models, taking into account the structure of the space. The idea is to project all the data from the manifold onto an affine tangent space at a particular point. To mitigate the distortion induced by local diffeomorphisms, we introduce for the first time in the computer vision community a well-founded mathematical concept, so-called Rolling map [21, 16]. The novelty in this alternate school of thought is that the manifold will be firstly rolled (without slipping or twisting) as a rigid body, then the given data is unwrapped onto the affine tangent space, where the classification is performed.</p><p>4 0.19078678 <a title="276-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Top-Down_Segmentation_of_Non-rigid_Visual_Objects_Using_Derivative-Based_Search_on_Sparse_Manifolds.html">433 cvpr-2013-Top-Down Segmentation of Non-rigid Visual Objects Using Derivative-Based Search on Sparse Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacinto C. Nascimento, Gustavo Carneiro</p><p>Abstract: The solution for the top-down segmentation of non-rigid visual objects using machine learning techniques is generally regarded as too complex to be solved in its full generality given the large dimensionality of the search space of the explicit representation ofthe segmentation contour. In order to reduce this complexity, theproblem is usually divided into two stages: rigid detection and non-rigid segmentation. The rationale is based on the fact that the rigid detection can be run in a lower dimensionality space (i.e., less complex and faster) than the original contour space, and its result is then used to constrain the non-rigid segmentation. In this paper, we propose the use of sparse manifolds to reduce the dimensionality of the rigid detection search space of current stateof-the-art top-down segmentation methodologies. The main goals targeted by this smaller dimensionality search space are the decrease of the search running time complexity and the reduction of the training complexity of the rigid detec- tor. These goals are attainable given that both the search and training complexities are function of the dimensionality of the rigid search space. We test our approach in the segmentation of the left ventricle from ultrasound images and lips from frontal face images. Compared to the performance of state-of-the-art non-rigid segmentation system, our experiments show that the use of sparse manifolds for the rigid detection leads to the two goals mentioned above.</p><p>5 0.19069797 <a title="276-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Sparse_Subspace_Denoising_for_Image_Manifolds.html">405 cvpr-2013-Sparse Subspace Denoising for Image Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Wang, Zhuowen Tu</p><p>Abstract: With the increasing availability of high dimensional data and demand in sophisticated data analysis algorithms, manifold learning becomes a critical technique to perform dimensionality reduction, unraveling the intrinsic data structure. The real-world data however often come with noises and outliers; seldom, all the data live in a single linear subspace. Inspired by the recent advances in sparse subspace learning and diffusion-based approaches, we propose a new manifold denoising algorithm in which data neighborhoods are adaptively inferred via sparse subspace reconstruction; we then derive a new formulation to perform denoising to the original data. Experiments carried out on both toy and real applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method; it is insensitive to parameter tuning and we show significant improvement over the competing algorithms.</p><p>6 0.18875089 <a title="276-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-rigid_Structure_from_Motion_with_Diffusion_Maps_Prior.html">306 cvpr-2013-Non-rigid Structure from Motion with Diffusion Maps Prior</a></p>

<p>Author: Nikolaos Pitelis, Chris Russell, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we return to the underlying mathematical definition of a manifold and directly characterise learning a manifold as finding an atlas, or a set of overlapping charts, that accurately describe local structure. We formulate the problem of learning the manifold as an optimisation that simultaneously refines the continuous parameters defining the charts, and the discrete assignment of points to charts. In contrast to existing methods, this direct formulation of a manifold does not require “unwrapping ” the manifold into a lower dimensional space and allows us to learn closed manifolds of interest to vision, such as those corresponding to gait cycles or camera pose. We report state-ofthe-art results for manifold based nearest neighbour classification on vision datasets, and show how the same techniques can be applied to the 3D reconstruction of human motion from a single image.</p><p>4 0.83750427 <a title="276-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Kernel_Learning_for_Extrinsic_Classification_of_Manifold_Features.html">237 cvpr-2013-Kernel Learning for Extrinsic Classification of Manifold Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices have become popular to encode image information. Accounting for the geometry of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices has proven key to the success of many algorithms. However, most existing methods only approximate the true shape of the manifold locally by its tangent plane. In this paper, inspired by kernel methods, we propose to map SPD matrices to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To encode the geometry of the manifold in the mapping, we introduce a family of provably positive definite kernels on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. These kernels are derived from the Gaussian kernel, but exploit different metrics on the manifold. This lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM and kernel PCA, to the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the problems of pedestrian detection, object categorization, texture analysis, 2D motion segmentation and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) segmentation.</p><p>6 0.71349275 <a title="276-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Top-Down_Segmentation_of_Non-rigid_Visual_Objects_Using_Derivative-Based_Search_on_Sparse_Manifolds.html">433 cvpr-2013-Top-Down Segmentation of Non-rigid Visual Objects Using Derivative-Based Search on Sparse Manifolds</a></p>

<p>Author: Amr Bakry, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a challenging problem, due to confusion between visual speech features. The speaker identification problem is usually coupled with speech recognition. Moreover, speaker identification is important to several applications, such as automatic access control, biometrics, authentication, and personal privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for lipreading and speaker identification. Wepropose a new approachfor manifold parameterization in a low-dimensional latent space, where each manifold is represented as a point in that space. We initially parameterize each instance manifold using a nonlinear mapping from a unified manifold representation. We then factorize the parameter space using Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) to achieve a low-dimension manifold latent space. We use two-way projections to achieve two manifold latent spaces, one for the speech content and one for the speaker. We apply our approach on two public databases: AVLetters and OuluVS. We show the results for three different settings of lipreading: speaker independent, speaker dependent, and speaker semi-dependent. Our approach outperforms for the speaker semi-dependent setting by at least 15% of the baseline, and competes in the other two settings.</p><p>2 0.63294435 <a title="276-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Sparse_Output_Coding_for_Large-Scale_Visual_Recognition.html">403 cvpr-2013-Sparse Output Coding for Large-Scale Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Bin Zhao, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Many vision tasks require a multi-class classifier to discriminate multiple categories, on the order of hundreds or thousands. In this paper, we propose sparse output coding, a principled way for large-scale multi-class classification, by turning high-cardinality multi-class categorization into a bit-by-bit decoding problem. Specifically, sparse output coding is composed of two steps: efficient coding matrix learning with scalability to thousands of classes, and probabilistic decoding. Empirical results on object recognition and scene classification demonstrate the effectiveness ofour proposed approach.</p><p>3 0.60783476 <a title="276-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Divide-and-Conquer_Method_for_Scalable_Low-Rank_Latent_Matrix_Pursuit.html">7 cvpr-2013-A Divide-and-Conquer Method for Scalable Low-Rank Latent Matrix Pursuit</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Pan, Hanjiang Lai, Cong Liu, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: Data fusion, which effectively fuses multiple prediction lists from different kinds of features to obtain an accurate model, is a crucial component in various computer vision applications. Robust late fusion (RLF) is a recent proposed method that fuses multiple output score lists from different models via pursuing a shared low-rank latent matrix. Despite showing promising performance, the repeated full Singular Value Decomposition operations in RLF’s optimization algorithm limits its scalability in real world vision datasets which usually have large number of test examples. To address this issue, we provide a scalable solution for large-scale low-rank latent matrix pursuit by a divide-andconquer method. The proposed method divides the original low-rank latent matrix learning problem into two sizereduced subproblems, which may be solved via any base algorithm, and combines the results from the subproblems to obtain the final solution. Our theoretical analysis shows that withfixedprobability, theproposed divide-and-conquer method has recovery guarantees comparable to those of its base algorithm. Moreover, we develop an efficient base algorithm for the corresponding subproblems by factorizing a large matrix into the product of two size-reduced matrices. We also provide high probability recovery guarantees of the base algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated on various fusion problems in object categorization and video event detection. Under comparable accuracy, the proposed method performs more than 180 times faster than the stateof-the-art baselines on the CCV dataset with about 4,500 test examples for video event detection.</p><p>4 0.55631095 <a title="276-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Intrinsic_Scene_Properties_from_a_Single_RGB-D_Image.html">227 cvpr-2013-Intrinsic Scene Properties from a Single RGB-D Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan T. Barron, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we extend the “shape, illumination and reflectance from shading ” (SIRFS) model [3, 4], which recovers intrinsic scene properties from a single image. Though SIRFS performs well on images of segmented objects, it performs poorly on images of natural scenes, which contain occlusion and spatially-varying illumination. We therefore present Scene-SIRFS, a generalization of SIRFS in which we have a mixture of shapes and a mixture of illuminations, and those mixture components are embedded in a “soft” segmentation of the input image. We additionally use the noisy depth maps provided by RGB-D sensors (in this case, the Kinect) to improve shape estimation. Our model takes as input a single RGB-D image and produces as output an improved depth map, a set of surface normals, a reflectance image, a shading image, and a spatially varying model of illumination. The output of our model can be used for graphics applications, or for any application involving RGB-D images.</p><p>5 0.55043912 <a title="276-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Class-to-Image_Distance_with_Object_Matchings.html">247 cvpr-2013-Learning Class-to-Image Distance with Object Matchings</a></p>
<p>Author: Guang-Tong Zhou, Tian Lan, Weilong Yang, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We conduct image classification by learning a class-toimage distance function that matches objects. The set of objects in training images for an image class are treated as a collage. When presented with a test image, the best matching between this collage of training image objects and those in the test image is found. We validate the efficacy of the proposed model on the PASCAL 07 and SUN 09 datasets, showing that our model is effective for object classification and scene classification tasks. State-of-the-art image classification results are obtained, and qualitative results demonstrate that objects can be accurately matched.</p><p>6 0.54705054 <a title="276-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Linear_Approach_to_Matching_Cuboids_in_RGBD_Images.html">16 cvpr-2013-A Linear Approach to Matching Cuboids in RGBD Images</a></p>

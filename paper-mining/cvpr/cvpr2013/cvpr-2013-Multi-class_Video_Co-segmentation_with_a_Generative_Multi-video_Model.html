<p>Author: Aditya Khosla, Raffay Hamid, Chih-Jen Lin, Neel Sundaresan</p><p>Abstract: Given the enormous growth in user-generated videos, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to navigate them efficiently. As these videos are generally of poor quality, summarization methods designed for well-produced videos do not generalize to them. To address this challenge, we propose to use web-images as a prior to facilitate summarization of user-generated videos. Our main intuition is that people tend to take pictures of objects to capture them in a maximally informative way. Such images could therefore be used as prior information to summarize videos containing a similar set of objects. In this work, we apply our novel insight to develop a summarization algorithm that uses the web-image based prior information in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, to automatically evaluate summarization algorithms on a large scale, we propose a framework that relies on multiple summaries obtained through crowdsourcing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our evaluation framework by comparing its performance to that ofmultiple human evaluators. Finally, wepresent resultsfor our framework tested on hundreds of user-generated videos.</p><p>3 0.21147022 <a title="294-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Geometric_Context_from_Videos.html">187 cvpr-2013-Geometric Context from Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: S. Hussain Raza, Matthias Grundmann, Irfan Essa</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for estimating the broad 3D geometric structure of outdoor video scenes. Leveraging spatio-temporal video segmentation, we decompose a dynamic scene captured by a video into geometric classes, based on predictions made by region-classifiers that are trained on appearance and motion features. By examining the homogeneity of the prediction, we combine predictions across multiple segmentation hierarchy levels alleviating the need to determine the granularity a priori. We built a novel, extensive dataset on geometric context of video to evaluate our method, consisting of over 100 groundtruth annotated outdoor videos with over 20,000 frames. To further scale beyond this dataset, we propose a semisupervised learning framework to expand the pool of labeled data with high confidence predictions obtained from unlabeled data. Our system produces an accurate prediction of geometric context of video achieving 96% accuracy across main geometric classes.</p><p>4 0.19527364 <a title="294-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Improving_an_Object_Detector_and_Extracting_Regions_Using_Superpixels.html">217 cvpr-2013-Improving an Object Detector and Extracting Regions Using Superpixels</a></p>
<p>Author: Guang Shu, Afshin Dehghan, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to improve the detection performance of a generic detector when it is applied to a particular video. The performance of offline-trained objects detectors are usually degraded in unconstrained video environments due to variant illuminations, backgrounds and camera viewpoints. Moreover, most object detectors are trained using Haar-like features or gradient features but ignore video specificfeatures like consistent colorpatterns. In our approach, we apply a Superpixel-based Bag-of-Words (BoW) model to iteratively refine the output of a generic detector. Compared to other related work, our method builds a video-specific detector using superpixels, hence it can handle the problem of appearance variation. Most importantly, using Conditional Random Field (CRF) along with our super pixel-based BoW model, we develop and algorithm to segment the object from the background . Therefore our method generates an output of the exact object regions instead of the bounding boxes generated by most detectors. In general, our method takes detection bounding boxes of a generic detector as input and generates the detection output with higher average precision and precise object regions. The experiments on four recent datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and significantly improves the state-of-art detector by 5-16% in average precision.</p><p>5 0.18198681 <a title="294-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Joint_Sparsity-Based_Representation_and_Analysis_of_Unconstrained_Activities.html">233 cvpr-2013-Joint Sparsity-Based Representation and Analysis of Unconstrained Activities</a></p>
<p>Author: Raghuraman Gopalan</p><p>Abstract: While the notion of joint sparsity in understanding common and innovative components of a multi-receiver signal ensemble has been well studied, we investigate the utility of such joint sparse models in representing information contained in a single video signal. By decomposing the content of a video sequence into that observed by multiple spatially and/or temporally distributed receivers, we first recover a collection of common and innovative components pertaining to individual videos. We then present modeling strategies based on subspace-driven manifold metrics to characterize patterns among these components, across other videos in the system, to perform subsequent video analysis. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for activity classification and clustering by reporting competitive results on standard datasets such as, HMDB, UCF-50, Olympic Sports and KTH.</p><p>6 0.17085584 <a title="294-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-First-Person_Activity_Recognition%3A_What_Are_They_Doing_to_Me%3F.html">175 cvpr-2013-First-Person Activity Recognition: What Are They Doing to Me?</a></p>

<p>Author: Zheng Lu, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We present a video summarization approach that discovers the story of an egocentric video. Given a long input video, our method selects a short chain of video subshots depicting the essential events. Inspired by work in text analysis that links news articles over time, we define a randomwalk based metric of influence between subshots that reflects how visual objects contribute to the progression of events. Using this influence metric, we define an objective for the optimal k-subshot summary. Whereas traditional methods optimize a summary ’s diversity or representativeness, ours explicitly accounts for how one sub-event “leads to ” another—which, critically, captures event connectivity beyond simple object co-occurrence. As a result, our summaries provide a better sense of story. We apply our approach to over 12 hours of daily activity video taken from 23 unique camera wearers, and systematically evaluate its quality compared to multiple baselines with 34 human subjects.</p><p>5 0.76457572 <a title="294-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Video_Representation_Using_Temporal_Superpixels.html">29 cvpr-2013-A Video Representation Using Temporal Superpixels</a></p>

In contrast to supervoxel methods, object parts in different frames are tracked by the same temporal superpixel. We explicitly model flow between frames with a bilateral Gaussian process and use this information to propagate superpixels in an online fashion. We consider four novel metrics to quantify performance of a temporal superpixel representation and demonstrate superior performance when compared to supervoxel methods.</p><p>6 0.74929529 <a title="294-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Video_Object_Segmentation_through_Spatially_Accurate_and_Temporally_Dense_Extraction_of_Primary_Object_Regions.html">455 cvpr-2013-Video Object Segmentation through Spatially Accurate and Temporally Dense Extraction of Primary Object Regions</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Ochs, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Thomas Brox, Thomas Pock</p><p>Abstract: Natural image statistics indicate that we should use nonconvex norms for most regularization tasks in image processing and computer vision. Still, they are rarely used in practice due to the challenge to optimize them. Recently, iteratively reweighed ?1 minimization has been proposed as a way to tackle a class of non-convex functions by solving a sequence of convex ?2-?1 problems. Here we extend the problem class to linearly constrained optimization of a Lipschitz continuous function, which is the sum of a convex function and a function being concave and increasing on the non-negative orthant (possibly non-convex and nonconcave on the whole space). This allows to apply the algorithm to many computer vision tasks. We show the effect of non-convex regularizers on image denoising, deconvolution, optical flow, and depth map fusion. Non-convexity is particularly interesting in combination with total generalized variation and learned image priors. Efficient optimization is made possible by some important properties that are shown to hold.</p><p>2 0.88551956 <a title="294-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Large-Scale_Structured_Learning.html">143 cvpr-2013-Efficient Large-Scale Structured Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Rodrigo Benenson, Markus Mathias, Tinne Tuytelaars, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: The current state of the art solutions for object detection describe each class by a set of models trained on discovered sub-classes (so called “components ”), with each model itself composed of collections of interrelated parts (deformable models). These detectors build upon the now classic Histogram of Oriented Gradients+linear SVM combo. In this paper we revisit some of the core assumptions in HOG+SVM and show that by properly designing the feature pooling, feature selection, preprocessing, and training methods, it is possible to reach top quality, at least for pedestrian detections, using a single rigid component. We provide experiments for a large design space, that give insights into the design of classifiers, as well as relevant information for practitioners. Our best detector is fully feed-forward, has a single unified architecture, uses only histograms of oriented gradients and colour information in monocular static images, and improves over 23 other methods on the INRIA, ETHand Caltech-USA datasets, reducing the average miss-rate over HOG+SVM by more than 30%.</p><p>4 0.82397443 <a title="294-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Segment-Tree_Based_Cost_Aggregation_for_Stereo_Matching.html">384 cvpr-2013-Segment-Tree Based Cost Aggregation for Stereo Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Xing Mei, Xun Sun, Weiming Dong, Haitao Wang, Xiaopeng Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel tree-based cost aggregation method for dense stereo matching. Instead of employing the minimum spanning tree (MST) and its variants, a new tree structure, ”Segment-Tree ”, is proposed for non-local matching cost aggregation. Conceptually, the segment-tree is constructed in a three-step process: first, the pixels are grouped into a set of segments with the reference color or intensity image; second, a tree graph is created for each segment; and in the final step, these independent segment graphs are linked to form the segment-tree structure. In practice, this tree can be efficiently built in time nearly linear to the number of the image pixels. Compared to MST where the graph connectivity is determined with local edge weights, our method introduces some ’non-local’ decision rules: the pixels in one perceptually consistent segment are more likely to share similar disparities, and therefore their connectivity within the segment should be first enforced in the tree construction process. The matching costs are then aggregated over the tree within two passes. Performance evaluation on 19 Middlebury data sets shows that the proposed method is comparable to previous state-of-the-art aggregation methods in disparity accuracy and processing speed. Furthermore, the tree structure can be refined with the estimated disparities, which leads to consistent scene segmentation and significantly better aggregation results.</p><p>5 0.78086019 <a title="294-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Geometric_Context_from_Videos.html">187 cvpr-2013-Geometric Context from Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: S. Hussain Raza, Matthias Grundmann, Irfan Essa</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for estimating the broad 3D geometric structure of outdoor video scenes. Leveraging spatio-temporal video segmentation, we decompose a dynamic scene captured by a video into geometric classes, based on predictions made by region-classifiers that are trained on appearance and motion features. By examining the homogeneity of the prediction, we combine predictions across multiple segmentation hierarchy levels alleviating the need to determine the granularity a priori. We built a novel, extensive dataset on geometric context of video to evaluate our method, consisting of over 100 groundtruth annotated outdoor videos with over 20,000 frames. To further scale beyond this dataset, we propose a semisupervised learning framework to expand the pool of labeled data with high confidence predictions obtained from unlabeled data. Our system produces an accurate prediction of geometric context of video achieving 96% accuracy across main geometric classes.</p><p>6 0.76992476 <a title="294-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Rotation%2C_Scaling_and_Deformation_Invariant_Scattering_for_Texture_Discrimination.html">369 cvpr-2013-Rotation, Scaling and Deformation Invariant Scattering for Texture Discrimination</a></p>

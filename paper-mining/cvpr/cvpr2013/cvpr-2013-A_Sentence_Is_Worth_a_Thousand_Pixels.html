<p>Author: Pradipto Das, Chenliang Xu, Richard F. Doell, Jason J. Corso</p><p>Abstract: The problem of describing images through natural language has gained importance in the computer vision community. Solutions to image description have either focused on a top-down approach of generating language through combinations of object detections and language models or bottom-up propagation of keyword tags from training images to test images through probabilistic or nearest neighbor techniques. In contrast, describing videos with natural language is a less studied problem. In this paper, we combine ideas from the bottom-up and top-down approaches to image description and propose a method for video description that captures the most relevant contents of a video in a natural language description. We propose a hybrid system consisting of a low level multimodal latent topic model for initial keyword annotation, a middle level of concept detectors and a high level module to produce final lingual descriptions. We compare the results of our system to human descriptions in both short and long forms on two datasets, and demonstrate that final system output has greater agreement with the human descriptions than any single level.</p><p>3 0.22616492 <a title="25-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Bringing_Semantics_into_Focus_Using_Visual_Abstraction.html">73 cvpr-2013-Bringing Semantics into Focus Using Visual Abstraction</a></p>
<p>Author: C. Lawrence Zitnick, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Relating visual information to its linguistic semantic meaning remains an open and challenging area of research. The semantic meaning of images depends on the presence of objects, their attributes and their relations to other objects. But precisely characterizing this dependence requires extracting complex visual information from an image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose studying semantic information in abstract images created from collections of clip art. Abstract images provide several advantages. They allow for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic information, since they remove the reliance on noisy low-level object, attribute and relation detectors, or the tedious hand-labeling of images. Importantly, abstract images also allow the ability to generate sets of semantically similar scenes. Finding analogous sets of semantically similar real images would be nearly impossible. We create 1,002 sets of 10 semantically similar abstract scenes with corresponding written descriptions. We thoroughly analyze this dataset to discover semantically important features, the relations of words to visual features and methods for measuring semantic similarity.</p><p>4 0.16652851 <a title="25-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Analyzing_Semantic_Segmentation_Using_Hybrid_Human-Machine_CRFs.html">43 cvpr-2013-Analyzing Semantic Segmentation Using Hybrid Human-Machine CRFs</a></p>
<p>Author: Roozbeh Mottaghi, Sanja Fidler, Jian Yao, Raquel Urtasun, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Recent trends in semantic image segmentation have pushed for holistic scene understanding models that jointly reason about various tasks such as object detection, scene recognition, shape analysis, contextual reasoning. In this work, we are interested in understanding the roles of these different tasks in aiding semantic segmentation. Towards this goal, we “plug-in ” human subjects for each of the various components in a state-of-the-art conditional random field model (CRF) on the MSRC dataset. Comparisons among various hybrid human-machine CRFs give us indications of how much “head room ” there is to improve segmentation by focusing research efforts on each of the tasks. One of the interesting findings from our slew of studies was that human classification of isolated super-pixels, while being worse than current machine classifiers, provides a significant boost in performance when plugged into the CRF! Fascinated by this finding, we conducted in depth analysis of the human generated potentials. This inspired a new machine potential which significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on the MRSC dataset.</p><p>5 0.15287355 <a title="25-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Bottom-Up_Segmentation_for_Top-Down_Detection.html">70 cvpr-2013-Bottom-Up Segmentation for Top-Down Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Sanja Fidler, Roozbeh Mottaghi, Alan Yuille, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we are interested in how semantic segmentation can help object detection. Towards this goal, we propose a novel deformable part-based model which exploits region-based segmentation algorithms that compute candidate object regions by bottom-up clustering followed by ranking of those regions. Our approach allows every detection hypothesis to select a segment (including void), and scores each box in the image using both the traditional HOG filters as well as a set of novel segmentation features. Thus our model “blends ” between the detector and segmentation models. Since our features can be computed very efficiently given the segments, we maintain the same complexity as the original DPM [14]. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in PASCAL VOC 2010, and show that when employing only a root filter our approach outperforms Dalal & Triggs detector [12] on all classes, achieving 13% higher average AP. When employing the parts, we outperform the original DPM [14] in 19 out of 20 classes, achieving an improvement of 8% AP. Furthermore, we outperform the previous state-of-the-art on VOC’10 test by 4%.</p><p>6 0.13432302 <a title="25-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Finding_Things%3A_Image_Parsing_with_Regions_and_Per-Exemplar_Detectors.html">173 cvpr-2013-Finding Things: Image Parsing with Regions and Per-Exemplar Detectors</a></p>

<p>Author: Heesoo Myeong, Kyoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric approach for semantic segmentation using high-order semantic relations. Conventional context models mainly focus on learning pairwise relationships between objects. Pairwise relations, however, are not enough to represent high-level contextual knowledge within images. In this paper, we propose semantic relation transfer, a method to transfer high-order semantic relations of objects from annotated images to unlabeled images analogous to label transfer techniques where label information are transferred. Wefirst define semantic tensors representing high-order relations of objects. Semantic relation transfer problem is then formulated as semi-supervised learning using a quadratic objective function of the semantic tensors. By exploiting low-rank property of the semantic tensors and employing Kronecker sum similarity, an efficient approximation algorithm is developed. Based on the predicted high-order semantic relations, we reason semantic segmentation and evaluate the performance on several challenging datasets.</p><p>4 0.69876212 <a title="25-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Analyzing_Semantic_Segmentation_Using_Hybrid_Human-Machine_CRFs.html">43 cvpr-2013-Analyzing Semantic Segmentation Using Hybrid Human-Machine CRFs</a></p>

<p>Author: Ning Zhu, Albert C.S. Chung</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for 3D vessel tree structure segmentation based on a new tubularity Markov tree model ( TMT), which works as both new energy function and graph construction method. With the help of power-watershed implementation [7], a global optimal segmentation can be obtained with low computational cost. Different with other graph-based vessel segmentation methods, the proposed method does not depend on any skeleton and ROI extraction method. The classical issues of the graph-based methods, such as shrinking bias and sensitivity to seed point location, can be solved with the proposed method thanks to vessel data fidelity obtained with TMT. The proposed method is compared with some classical graph-based image segmentation methods and two up-to-date 3D vessel segmentation methods, and is demonstrated to be more accurate than these methods for 3D vessel tree segmentation. Although the segmentation is done without ROI extraction, the computational cost for the proposed method is low (within 20 seconds for 256*256*144 image).</p><p>2 0.8676849 <a title="25-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Keypoints_from_Symmetries_by_Wave_Propagation.html">240 cvpr-2013-Keypoints from Symmetries by Wave Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuele Salti, Alessandro Lanza, Luigi Di_Stefano</p><p>Abstract: The paper conjectures and demonstrates that repeatable keypoints based on salient symmetries at different scales can be detected by a novel analysis grounded on the wave equation rather than the heat equation underlying traditional Gaussian scale–space theory. While the image structures found by most state-of-the-art detectors, such as blobs and corners, occur typically on planar highly textured surfaces, salient symmetries are widespread in diverse kinds of images, including those related to untextured objects, which are hardly dealt with by current feature-based recognition pipelines. We provide experimental results on standard datasets and also contribute with a new dataset focused on untextured objects. Based on the positive experimental results, we hope to foster further research on the promising topic ofscale invariant analysis through the wave equation.</p><p>3 0.85916543 <a title="25-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Shading-Based_Shape_Refinement_of_RGB-D_Images.html">394 cvpr-2013-Shading-Based Shape Refinement of RGB-D Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Lap-Fai Yu, Sai-Kit Yeung, Yu-Wing Tai, Stephen Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present a shading-based shape refinement algorithm which uses a noisy, incomplete depth map from Kinect to help resolve ambiguities in shape-from-shading. In our framework, the partial depth information is used to overcome bas-relief ambiguity in normals estimation, as well as to assist in recovering relative albedos, which are needed to reliably estimate the lighting environment and to separate shading from albedo. This refinement of surface normals using a noisy depth map leads to high-quality 3D surfaces. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through several challenging real-world examples.</p><p>4 0.85066569 <a title="25-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-parametric_Filtering_for_Geometric_Detail_Extraction_and_Material_Representation.html">305 cvpr-2013-Non-parametric Filtering for Geometric Detail Extraction and Material Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zicheng Liao, Jason Rock, Yang Wang, David Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: Geometric detail is a universal phenomenon in real world objects. It is an important component in object modeling, but not accounted for in current intrinsic image works. In this work, we explore using a non-parametric method to separate geometric detail from intrinsic image components. We further decompose an image as albedo ∗ (ccoomarpsoen-escnatsle. shading +e shading pdoestaeil a).n Oaugre decomposition offers quantitative improvement in albedo recovery and material classification.Our method also enables interesting image editing activities, including bump removal, geometric detail smoothing/enhancement and material transfer.</p><p>5 0.84339023 <a title="25-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Voxel_Cloud_Connectivity_Segmentation_-_Supervoxels_for_Point_Clouds.html">458 cvpr-2013-Voxel Cloud Connectivity Segmentation - Supervoxels for Point Clouds</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeremie Papon, Alexey Abramov, Markus Schoeler, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised over-segmentation of an image into regions of perceptually similar pixels, known as superpixels, is a widely used preprocessing step in segmentation algorithms. Superpixel methods reduce the number of regions that must be considered later by more computationally expensive algorithms, with a minimal loss of information. Nevertheless, as some information is inevitably lost, it is vital that superpixels not cross object boundaries, as such errors will propagate through later steps. Existing methods make use of projected color or depth information, but do not consider three dimensional geometric relationships between observed data points which can be used to prevent superpixels from crossing regions of empty space. We propose a novel over-segmentation algorithm which uses voxel relationships to produce over-segmentations which are fully consistent with the spatial geometry of the scene in three dimensional, rather than projective, space. Enforcing the constraint that segmented regions must have spatial connectivity prevents label flow across semantic object boundaries which might otherwise be violated. Additionally, as the algorithm works directly in 3D space, observations from several calibrated RGB+D cameras can be segmented jointly. Experiments on a large data set of human annotated RGB+D images demonstrate a significant reduction in occurrence of clusters crossing object boundaries, while maintaining speeds comparable to state-of-the-art 2D methods.</p><p>6 0.81319183 <a title="25-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Bayesian_Depth-from-Defocus_with_Shading_Constraints.html">56 cvpr-2013-Bayesian Depth-from-Defocus with Shading Constraints</a></p>

</p><p>7 Introduction Monocular template-based 3D reconstruction and representation of nonrigid objects require models with the ability to assume a wide variety of shapes and to track complex  motion. [sent-9, score-0.168]
</p><p>8 The models must be able to recover a plausible deformed shape (or at least a set of discrete plausible deformed shapes) from noise-corrupted features while making the weakest possible assumptions about the observed shape. [sent-10, score-0.531]
</p><p>9 On the one hand, previous approaches based on physical constraints address this problem in the case of isometric [6, 15], and conformal [9, 4] deformations. [sent-11, score-0.847]
</p><p>10 On the other hand, statistical learning approaches [16, 13] have shown effectiveness only on isometric surfaces. [sent-12, score-0.34]
</p><p>11 In this paper, we present a new physical-based approach for monocular template-based reconstruction of extensible and compressible surfaces with only one mechanical parameter. [sent-13, score-0.842]
</p><p>12 As physical priors, our approach relies only on the Poisson ratio of the surface material assumed to be linear Hookean ∗This research has received funding from the EU’s FP7 through ERC grant 307483 FLEXABLE. [sent-14, score-0.566]
</p><p>13 This Poisson parameter models the tendency of a material to be compressed in a transverse direction when it is stretched in the longitudinal direction [5]. [sent-19, score-0.475]
</p><p>14 Our formulation is based on the principle that any extensible/compressible surface lies in the minimal stretching energy state subject to external applied constraints. [sent-20, score-0.731]
</p><p>15 Accordingly, we formulate the reconstruction problem as being to estimate the shape that has minimal stretching energy given a set of boundary points, and is consistent with the measured image data. [sent-21, score-0.644]
</p><p>16 The results are close to the real deformed surface as will be shown later in the experimental results section. [sent-22, score-0.401]
</p><p>17 Related Work and Contribution Different types of constraints have been proposed and can be categorized as statistical or physical constraints. [sent-24, score-0.271]
</p><p>18 Statistical constraints often model the deformation as a linear combination of basis vectors, which can be learned online either for human face reconstruction [11] or for generic shapes [15, 13, 18]. [sent-25, score-0.422]
</p><p>19 Non-linear learning methods were applied in human tracking [14] and then extended for more generic surfaces [16]. [sent-26, score-0.243]
</p><p>20 Physical constraints include spatial and temporal priors on the surface. [sent-27, score-0.152]
</p><p>21 In [3] physical constraints are used as priors for a coarse-to-fine shape-basis statistical model. [sent-28, score-0.355]
</p><p>22 A physical prior that has been studied is the isometry constraint [6], which requires that any surface geodesic distance is preserved after deformation. [sent-29, score-0.47]
</p><p>23 This approach has proven its accuracy for paper-like surfaces and was recently extended for non-developable surfaces undergoing conformal deformation[9]. [sent-30, score-0.724]
</p><p>24 More recently, [4] have studied the well-posedness of both isometric and conformal deformations. [sent-31, score-0.62]
</p><p>25 Their applicability in real world deforming object remains limited (paper like surfaces, deforming balls under isotropic conditions). [sent-32, score-0.312]
</p><p>26 Thus, the problem of monocular template-based 3D reconstruction of realistic deformations has not yet been tackled. [sent-33, score-0.431]
</p><p>27 However, a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) method for elastic surfaces was attempted with fixed boundary conditions [1] and later extended to free boundary conditions [2]. [sent-34, score-0.564]
</p><p>28 The surface is assumed to be homeomorphic to a disc. [sent-36, score-0.316]
</p><p>29 It uses an FEM (Finite Element Method) to model the surface and approximate the deformation forces. [sent-38, score-0.365]
</p><p>30 The surface and the deformation forces are both estimated using an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter). [sent-39, score-0.365]
</p><p>31 It is important though to distinguish SLAM and monocular template-based reconstruction methods. [sent-40, score-0.315]
</p><p>32 These assumptions simplify the problem since during tracking small deformations are sequentially integrated and added to the surface. [sent-42, score-0.147]
</p><p>33 However, in monocular template-based approaches, the rate of deformation of the deformed surface may be very large and multiple solutions may appear. [sent-43, score-0.736]
</p><p>34 This work goes beyond isometric and conformal deformations to consider elastic deformations for monocular template-based reconstruction. [sent-45, score-1.176]
</p><p>35 First, we formalize the reconstruction problem of a generic surface in terms of the minimization of stretching energy. [sent-47, score-0.759]
</p><p>36 From classic linear elasticity theory [5] we derive a patch-based formulation of the stretching energy of an elastic surface. [sent-48, score-0.793]
</p><p>37 This formulation unifies geometrical and mechanical constrains in a single energy term. [sent-49, score-0.421]
</p><p>38 Second, we show that we do not have global scale ambiguities and we prevent local scale ambiguities by imposing a set of fixed boundary 3D points. [sent-50, score-0.324]
</p><p>39 We experimentally prove that this set of boundary condition sufficiently constrain the solution. [sent-51, score-0.166]
</p><p>40 Third, we propose an iterative method to solve our extensible surface reconstruction problem. [sent-52, score-0.507]
</p><p>41 Geometric Priors as Physical Constraints: Isometric and Conformal A smoothly deforming surface S homeomorphic to a disc, can be modelled as an embedding of a template Ω into R3. [sent-54, score-0.491]
</p><p>42 It is described by a surface function ϕ of two variables (u, v) ∈ Ω : ϕ : Ω ⊂ R2 → R3 . [sent-55, score-0.219]
</p><p>43 It is intuitively constrained by a set of point correspondences, represented by the 2D warp η, between the template and the input image. [sent-57, score-0.07]
</p><p>44 The nature of the surface deformations are encoded in the differential prop-  ××  erties of ϕ. [sent-58, score-0.335]
</p><p>45 The Jacobian, denoted Jϕ, is a 3 2 matrix which measures and characterizes the lo,ca ils e ax t3en ×si o2n m mofa ttrhiex deformations. [sent-59, score-0.153]
</p><p>46 Jϕ, gives the required tensor to distances on the deformed shape. [sent-61, score-0.237]
</p><p>47 It is a 2 2 matrix which maps the loonc athl edid setafonrcmese dfr sohma Ωe. [sent-62, score-0.09]
</p><p>48 aPr 2ev ×io 2u ms watroirxk whahisc hfoc muaspeds hone two types of mappings: isometric and conformal. [sent-64, score-0.296]
</p><p>49 This property has been used as the main constraint in formalizing the problem of monocular template-based 3D reconstruction of isometric surfaces [6]. [sent-66, score-0.881]
</p><p>50 This deformation assumption has been used as the main constraint in formalizing the problem of monocular template-based 3D reconstruction of conformal surfaces [9, 4]. [sent-70, score-1.055]
</p><p>51 In our work, we link this geometric tensor to mechanical priors and then unify geometric and mechanical constraints in one equation, as will be seen in the next section. [sent-71, score-0.551]
</p><p>52 Mechanical Priors as Physical Constraints: Our Stretching Energy Our idea is to model the material being deformed as made of some elastic material, and minimizing the deformation energy in trying to fit the surface to the data. [sent-73, score-0.898]
</p><p>53 For isotropic materials, the deformation energy is computed in terms of the Young’s modulus E and the Poisson ratio ν [5]. [sent-74, score-0.448]
</p><p>54 Background Consider a rod of some material with rest length L, which is longitudinally stretched with a force F. [sent-77, score-0.463]
</p><p>55 Young’s modulus expresses the relationship of the force to the extension of the rod: F = E dL/L , (1) where dL/L is the relative extension of the rod, and E is Young’s modulus. [sent-78, score-0.183]
</p><p>56 It is measured in Pascals (Newtons per square metre the square metres relating to the crosssection of the rod). [sent-79, score-0.049]
</p><p>57 The Poisson ratio ν models the tendency of a material to become thinner when it is stretched. [sent-80, score-0.264]
</p><p>58 To be exact, for a unit cube of material, –  −ν =ΔΔyx=ΔΔxz Δx Δy  Δz  where , and are small changes in dimension when the cube is stretched (or compressed) in the X direction without constraints in the other directions, as shown in figure 2-a. [sent-82, score-0.358]

<p>Author: Adrien Bartoli, Toby Collins</p><p>Abstract: It has been shown that a surface deforming isometrically can be reconstructed from a single image and a template 3D shape. Methods from the literature solve this problem efficiently. However, they all assume that the camera model is calibrated, which drastically limits their applicability. We propose (i) a general variational framework that applies to (calibrated and uncalibrated) general camera models and (ii) self-calibrating 3D reconstruction algorithms for the weak-perspective and full-perspective camera models. In the former case, our algorithm returns the normal field and camera ’s scale factor. In the latter case, our algorithm returns the normal field, depth and camera ’s focal length. Our algorithms are the first to achieve deformable 3D reconstruction including camera self-calibration. They apply to much more general setups than existing methods. Experimental results on simulated and real data show that our algorithms give results with the same level of accuracy as existing methods (which use the true focal length) on perspective images, and correctly find the normal field on affine images for which the existing methods fail.</p><p>3 0.17214312 <a title="289-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Area_Preserving_Brain_Mapping.html">44 cvpr-2013-Area Preserving Brain Mapping</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengyu Su, Wei Zeng, Rui Shi, Yalin Wang, Jian Sun, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Brain mapping transforms the brain cortical surface to canonical planar domains, which plays a fundamental role in morphological study. Most existing brain mapping methods are based on angle preserving maps, which may introduce large area distortions. This work proposes an area preserving brain mapping method based on MongeBrenier theory. The brain mapping is intrinsic to the Riemannian metric, unique, and diffeomorphic. The computation is equivalent to convex energy minimization and power Voronoi diagram construction. Comparing to the existing approaches based on Monge-Kantorovich theory, the proposed one greatly reduces the complexity (from n2 unknowns to n ), and improves the simplicity and efficiency. Experimental results on caudate nucleus surface mapping and cortical surface mapping demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method. Conventional methods for caudate nucleus surface mapping may suffer from numerical instability; in contrast, current method produces diffeomorpic mappings stably. In the study of cortical sur- face classification for recognition of Alzheimer’s Disease, the proposed method outperforms some other morphometry features.</p><p>4 0.14033861 <a title="289-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Intrinsic_Characterization_of_Dynamic_Surfaces.html">226 cvpr-2013-Intrinsic Characterization of Dynamic Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Tony Tung, Takashi Matsuyama</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to characterize deformable surface using intrinsic property dynamics. 3D dynamic surfaces representing humans in motion can be obtained using multiple view stereo reconstruction methods or depth cameras. Nowadays these technologies have become capable to capture surface variations in real-time, and give details such as clothing wrinkles and deformations. Assuming repetitive patterns in the deformations, we propose to model complex surface variations using sets of linear dynamical systems (LDS) where observations across time are given by surface intrinsic properties such as local curvatures. We introduce an approach based on bags of dynamical systems, where each surface feature to be represented in the codebook is modeled by a set of LDS equipped with timing structure. Experiments are performed on datasets of real-world dynamical surfaces and show compelling results for description, classification and segmentation.</p><p>5 0.1246952 <a title="289-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic_Harmonic_Mapping_for_Constrained_Brain_Surface_Registration.html">208 cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic Harmonic Mapping for Constrained Brain Surface Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Shi, Wei Zeng, Zhengyu Su, Hanna Damasio, Zhonglin Lu, Yalin Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is an active research field in computer vision, computer graphics and computational geometry. It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquer this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric, so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on the Ricci flow method and the method is general and robust. We apply our algorithm to study constrained human brain surface registration problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic, and achieve relative high performance when evaluated with some popular cortical surface registration evaluation standards.</p><p>6 0.11123529 <a title="289-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_Reconstruction_Using_3D_Object_Shape_Priors.html">111 cvpr-2013-Dense Reconstruction Using 3D Object Shape Priors</a></p>

<p>Author: Abed Malti, Richard Hartley, Adrien Bartoli, Jae-Hak Kim</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for template-based extensible surface reconstruction from a single view. We extend the method of isometric surface reconstruction and more recent work on conformal surface reconstruction. Our approach relies on the minimization of a proposed stretching energy formalized with respect to the Poisson ratio parameter of the surface. We derive a patch-based formulation of this stretching energy by assuming local linear elasticity. This formulation unifies geometrical and mechanical constraints in a single energy term. We prevent local scale ambiguities by imposing a set of fixed boundary 3D points. We experimentally prove the sufficiency of this set of boundary points and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different developable and non-developable surfaces with a wide range of extensibility.</p><p>2 0.83099508 <a title="289-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Intrinsic_Characterization_of_Dynamic_Surfaces.html">226 cvpr-2013-Intrinsic Characterization of Dynamic Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Tony Tung, Takashi Matsuyama</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to characterize deformable surface using intrinsic property dynamics. 3D dynamic surfaces representing humans in motion can be obtained using multiple view stereo reconstruction methods or depth cameras. Nowadays these technologies have become capable to capture surface variations in real-time, and give details such as clothing wrinkles and deformations. Assuming repetitive patterns in the deformations, we propose to model complex surface variations using sets of linear dynamical systems (LDS) where observations across time are given by surface intrinsic properties such as local curvatures. We introduce an approach based on bags of dynamical systems, where each surface feature to be represented in the codebook is modeled by a set of LDS equipped with timing structure. Experiments are performed on datasets of real-world dynamical surfaces and show compelling results for description, classification and segmentation.</p><p>3 0.8276884 <a title="289-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic_Harmonic_Mapping_for_Constrained_Brain_Surface_Registration.html">208 cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic Harmonic Mapping for Constrained Brain Surface Registration</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Shi, Wei Zeng, Zhengyu Su, Hanna Damasio, Zhonglin Lu, Yalin Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is an active research field in computer vision, computer graphics and computational geometry. It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquer this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric, so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on the Ricci flow method and the method is general and robust. We apply our algorithm to study constrained human brain surface registration problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic, and achieve relative high performance when evaluated with some popular cortical surface registration evaluation standards.</p><p>4 0.80519509 <a title="289-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Area_Preserving_Brain_Mapping.html">44 cvpr-2013-Area Preserving Brain Mapping</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengyu Su, Wei Zeng, Rui Shi, Yalin Wang, Jian Sun, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Brain mapping transforms the brain cortical surface to canonical planar domains, which plays a fundamental role in morphological study. Most existing brain mapping methods are based on angle preserving maps, which may introduce large area distortions. This work proposes an area preserving brain mapping method based on MongeBrenier theory. The brain mapping is intrinsic to the Riemannian metric, unique, and diffeomorphic. The computation is equivalent to convex energy minimization and power Voronoi diagram construction. Comparing to the existing approaches based on Monge-Kantorovich theory, the proposed one greatly reduces the complexity (from n2 unknowns to n ), and improves the simplicity and efficiency. Experimental results on caudate nucleus surface mapping and cortical surface mapping demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method. Conventional methods for caudate nucleus surface mapping may suffer from numerical instability; in contrast, current method produces diffeomorpic mappings stably. In the study of cortical sur- face classification for recognition of Alzheimer’s Disease, the proposed method outperforms some other morphometry features.</p><p>5 0.7986263 <a title="289-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-scale_Curve_Detection_on_Surfaces.html">298 cvpr-2013-Multi-scale Curve Detection on Surfaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Kolomenkin, Ilan Shimshoni, Ayellet Tal</p><p>Abstract: This paper extends to surfaces the multi-scale approach of edge detection on images. The common practice for detecting curves on surfaces requires the user to first select the scale of the features, apply an appropriate smoothing, and detect the edges on the smoothed surface. This approach suffers from two drawbacks. First, it relies on a hidden assumption that all the features on the surface are of the same scale. Second, manual user intervention is required. In this paper, we propose a general framework for automatically detecting the optimal scale for each point on the surface. We smooth the surface at each point according to this optimal scale and run the curve detection algorithm on the resulting surface. Our multi-scale algorithm solves the two disadvantages of the single-scale approach mentioned above. We demonstrate how to realize our approach on two commonly-used special cases: ridges & valleys and relief edges. In each case, the optimal scale is found in accordance with the mathematical definition of the curve.</p><p>6 0.77528805 <a title="289-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Contactless%2C_Low-Cost_and_Accurate_3D_Fingerprint_Identification.html">435 cvpr-2013-Towards Contactless, Low-Cost and Accurate 3D Fingerprint Identification</a></p>

<p>Author: Peng Wang, Chunhua Shen, Anton van_den_Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Many computer vision problems can be formulated as binary quadratic programs (BQPs). Two classic relaxation methods are widely used for solving BQPs, namely, spectral methods and semidefinite programming (SDP), each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Spectral relaxation is simple and easy to implement, but its bound is loose. Semidefinite relaxation has a tighter bound, but its computational complexity is high for large scale problems. We present a new SDP formulation for BQPs, with two desirable properties. First, it has a similar relaxation bound to conventional SDP formulations. Second, compared with conventional SDP methods, the new SDP formulation leads to a significantly more efficient and scalable dual optimization approach, which has the same degree of complexity as spectral methods. Extensive experiments on various applications including clustering, image segmentation, co-segmentation and registration demonstrate the usefulness of our SDP formulation for solving large-scale BQPs.</p><p>3 0.73716903 <a title="289-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Intrinsic_Characterization_of_Dynamic_Surfaces.html">226 cvpr-2013-Intrinsic Characterization of Dynamic Surfaces</a></p>

<p>Author: Keyang Shi, Keze Wang, Jiangbo Lu, Liang Lin</p><p>Abstract: Driven by recent vision and graphics applications such as image segmentation and object recognition, assigning pixel-accurate saliency values to uniformly highlight foreground objects becomes increasingly critical. More often, such fine-grained saliency detection is also desired to have a fast runtime. Motivated by these, we propose a generic and fast computational framework called PISA Pixelwise Image Saliency Aggregating complementary saliency cues based on color and structure contrasts with spatial priors holistically. Overcoming the limitations of previous methods often using homogeneous superpixel-based and color contrast-only treatment, our PISA approach directly performs saliency modeling for each individual pixel and makes use of densely overlapping, feature-adaptive observations for saliency measure computation. We further impose a spatial prior term on each of the two contrast measures, which constrains pixels rendered salient to be compact and also centered in image domain. By fusing complementary contrast measures in such a pixelwise adaptive manner, the detection effectiveness is significantly boosted. Without requiring reliable region segmentation or post– relaxation, PISA exploits an efficient edge-aware image representation and filtering technique and produces spatially coherent yet detail-preserving saliency maps. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate PISA’s superior detection accuracy and competitive runtime speed over the state-of-the-arts approaches.</p><p>5 0.69626456 <a title="289-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Consensus_of_k-NNs_for_Robust_Neighborhood_Selection_on_Graph-Based_Manifolds.html">91 cvpr-2013-Consensus of k-NNs for Robust Neighborhood Selection on Graph-Based Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Vittal Premachandran, Ramakrishna Kakarala</p><p>Abstract: Propagating similarity information along the data manifold requires careful selection of local neighborhood. Selecting a “good” neighborhood in an unsupervised setting, given an affinity graph, has been a difficult task. The most common way to select a local neighborhood has been to use the k-nearest neighborhood (k-NN) selection criterion. However, it has the tendency to include noisy edges. In this paper, we propose a way to select a robust neighborhood using the consensus of multiple rounds of k-NNs. We explain how using consensus information can give better control over neighborhood selection. We also explain in detail the problems with another recently proposed neighborhood selection criteria, i.e., Dominant Neighbors, and show that our method is immune to those problems. Finally, we show the results from experiments in which we compare our method to other neighborhood selection approaches. The results corroborate our claims that consensus ofk-NNs does indeed help in selecting more robust and stable localities.</p><p>6 0.69367868 <a title="289-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Integrating_Grammar_and_Segmentation_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">225 cvpr-2013-Integrating Grammar and Segmentation for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>

[sent-2, score-0.804]
</p><p>2 Exact inference allows our model to outperform previous image segmentation methods, and to see the true effect of coupling graph edges. [sent-3, score-0.298]
</p><p>3 Like many other image labeling problems, interactive segmentation is commonly modelled using pairwise Markov Random fields that incorporate priors on labels of pairs of neighbouring pixels. [sent-8, score-0.405]
</p><p>4 These models allow efficient inference of the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) solution using algorithms such graph cuts [4, 28] but have restricted expressive power [12]. [sent-9, score-0.196]
</p><p>5 One of the major side-effects of using pairwise MRFs for segmentation is the short-boundary bias [20], illustrated in Figure 1(c). [sent-10, score-0.21]
</p><p>6 It results from the fact that the standard pairwise model encourages smooth segmentations by penalizing the assignment of different labels to neighbouring pixels [1, 4]. [sent-11, score-0.328]
</p><p>7 Jegelka & Bilmes [11] recently proposed a different approach – a cooperative graph cut model – to overcome the short-boundary bias. [sent-16, score-0.612]
</p><p>8 Instead of favoring short object boundaries by penalizing the number of label discontinuities, their model favors “congruous” boundaries by penalizing the number of types of label discontinuities. [sent-17, score-0.168]
</p><p>9 This new term is a submodular function on pairs of variables, a cooperative cut potential. [sent-18, score-0.664]
</p><p>10 The cost of label discontinuities does not grow linearly with the number of discontinuities in the labeling, as is the case in the standard pairwise model. [sent-19, score-0.287]
</p><p>11 Cooperative cut potentials can make MAP inference an NP-hard problem, and therefore [11] propose an approximation algorithm that  still outperforms previous segmentation methods. [sent-21, score-0.606]
</p><p>12 In this work, we rephrase the model of [11] and construct an equivalent hierarchical model by using a transformation inspired by a lower envelope representation of higher-order potentials [13]. [sent-24, score-0.392]
</p><p>13 (ii) It yields a refined complexity analysis and, in the language of parameterized complexity [8, 23], shows that a practically useful subset of cooperative cut problems is fixed-parameter tractable. [sent-28, score-0.546]
</p><p>14 (iv) The model structure shows an explicit connection between cooperative cuts and hierarchical models, hinting at the potential representational power of deep models such as Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM) [27]. [sent-31, score-0.586]
</p><p>15 Coupling Edges for Image Segmentation We first introduce the standard pairwise Markov ran-  dom field (MRF) model for interactive segmentation and the extension proposed in [11]. [sent-33, score-0.254]

</p><p>24 The Short-Boundary Bias and Coupling Edges The above pairwise model can be illustrated by a gridstructured graph, where each potential ψij corresponds to an edge. [sent-54, score-0.217]
</p><p>25 A labeling corresponds to a partition of this graph,  and label discontinuities between neighboring pixels correspond to cut edges. [sent-55, score-0.349]
</p><p>26 The potential (1) grows linearly with the weights θij of cut edges or neighboring pixels with differing labels. [sent-56, score-0.372]
</p><p>27 In particular, in the special case of θ being constant, the contribution of the pairwise potentials to the energy is a linear function of the perimeter of the figure. [sent-57, score-0.584]

</p><p>29 iTmhiel new energy considers all pairs of a type simultaneously and gives a “discount” for using edges (pairs) of the same type. [sent-66, score-0.25]
</p><p>30 The discount results from a monotonically increasing concave function F, and the resulting energy function is  =  E(x) Xφi(xi) +XΨg(x), Xi∈V Xg∈G Ψg(x) = F? [sent-67, score-0.234]
</p><p>31 ,  where  (4) (5)  As the values of the pairwise penalty terms are grouped together using a higher-order potential, [11] referred to this model as coupling edges, or cooperative cuts. [sent-69, score-0.674]
</p><p>32 If F is the identity, then the energy in Equation (4) is equal to the standard energy (1). [sent-71, score-0.278]

</p><p>34 Inferring the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) solution of the models above corresponds to minimizing their respective energy functions. [sent-75, score-0.2]
</p><p>35 It is well known that the energy function (1) is submodular if all θ(Ii, Ij ) ≥ 0 and can then be minimized in polynomial time by so)lv ≥ing an (s, t)-mincut problem [4]. [sent-76, score-0.264]
</p><p>36 In contrast, the higherorder potential (5) makes MAP inference in general NPhard, and therefore [11] proposed an iterative bound minimization algorithm for approximate inference. [sent-77, score-0.207]
</p><p>37 We show 111999777200  next that higher order potentials of the form (5) can be converted into a pairwise model by the addition of some binary auxiliary variables. [sent-78, score-0.562]
</p><p>38 Since inference in pairwise models is very well studied, one popular technique is to transform the higher-order energy function into that of a pairwise random field. [sent-81, score-0.473]
</p><p>39 In fact, any higher-order pseudoboolean function can be converted to a pairwise one, by introducing additional auxiliary random variables [2, 10, 13]. [sent-82, score-0.276]
</p><p>40 Unfortunately, the number of auxiliary variables grows exponentially with the arity of the function, and in practice this approach is only feasible for higher-order functions with few variables. [sent-83, score-0.176]
</p><p>41 This is the case for the edgecoupling potentials (4). [sent-85, score-0.301]
</p><p>42 We explain our transformation using the example of a special cooperative cut potential:  Ψg(x)  = minnXij∈Egθij|xi− xj|,To,  (6)  where T is a truncation parameter. [sent-86, score-0.59]
</p><p>43 Incorporated  into energy (4), this potential penalizes the number of types of transitions in the boundary. [sent-88, score-0.24]
</p><p>44 Instead of using lower envelopes of linear (modular) functions as they did, our transformation will employ lower envelopes of general second order functions. [sent-90, score-0.17]
</p><p>45 A similar application of lower envelopes was used in [9], but for different potentials in a different application. [sent-91, score-0.364]
</p><p>46 The problem of minimizing the cooperative cut potential (6) is equivalent to minimizing a pairwise function with additional |Eg | + 1auxiliary variables. [sent-93, score-0.831]
</p><p>47 First, we rewrite the potential in Equation (6) as a third order pseudo-boolean function by represenPting it as a lower envelope of the two functions f1(x) = Pij∈Eg θij |xi − xj | and f2 (x) = T. [sent-96, score-0.364]
</p><p>48 This strategy has been used to express higher order potentials that are concave functions of the value of modular function [15]. [sent-108, score-0.445]
</p><p>49 If |G| is fixed, there is an FPTAS for minimizing energy ( I5f) Gw|it ihs any nondecreasing, nonnegative concave function F, i. [sent-112, score-0.238]
</p><p>50 assume that the pairwise potentials are directed, i. [sent-123, score-0.445]
</p><p>51 The potentials (6) (and equally (5)) extend to directed edges too:  =  Ψg(x)  = minnXij∈Egθij(xi− xj)+,To. [sent-127, score-0.43]
</p><p>52 (10)  The two potentials ψij and ψji may belong to different groups g; in that case they are discounted differently and independently. [sent-128, score-0.337]
</p><p>53 The cooperative cut potential (10) is equivalent to a pairwise potential with |Eg | + 1auxiliary variables. [sent-130, score-0.836]
</p><p>54 But the problem (11) contains one additional binary variable per edge zij and per group of edges hg, and this large number makes any such direct relaxation approach computationally very expensive. [sent-135, score-0.27]
</p><p>55 If we fix the value of the variables hg, then the non-submodular pairwise terms (xi + xj)hg become linear, and the resulting submodular energy function can be minimized exactly and efficiently. [sent-137, score-0.423]
</p><p>56 As there are only few hg, we compute the MAP solution of the overall energy by finding the global minimum for each possible assignment of the hg using a graph cut algorithm [5]. [sent-138, score-0.908]
</p><p>57 To  speed up the search over all possible assignments of hg we use a dynamic max-flow algorithm [17] that rapidly solves a set of related max-flow problems. [sent-142, score-0.45]
</p><p>58 Moreover, we sort the variables hg in decreasing order with respect to the total weight of edges that correspond to type g and make variables with lower weight change their value more often than those with higher weight. [sent-144, score-0.64]
</p><p>59 In addition, we investigate three greedy heuristics that are polynomial in the number |G| of types: Greedy: oSmtairatl iwnit thh ea nllu hg = 1, a onfd t iteratively switch the label of that hg whose switch to zero decreases the energy most; repeat until there is no more improvement. [sent-146, score-1.289]
</p><p>60 Descent: Like Greedy, but applying the switch whenever it improves the energy without searching for the best switch. [sent-147, score-0.181]
</p><p>61 1-pass: Pass over all variables hg only once, applying all 111999777422  switches that decrease the energy. [sent-148, score-0.507]
</p><p>62 All of these heuristics require testing whether changing the value of a particular variable hg will reduce the energy. [sent-149, score-0.541]
</p><p>63 If we want to avoid searching over all assignments of the group indicator variables hg, then we can alternatively employ the common heuristic of simply pruning out the non-submodular terms, here the terms (xi + xj)hg, from the energy [19, 24]. [sent-152, score-0.196]
</p><p>64 This truncation results in an under-approximation of the energy since the deleted terms contributed a positive cost. [sent-153, score-0.183]
</p><p>65 Minimizing the remaining energy using graph cuts, we obtain solutions h∗ and x∗ . [sent-154, score-0.205]
</p><p>66 Multiple labels Equivalently to binary MRFs, can be extended to variables xi a discrete space L. [sent-159, score-0.243]

</p><p>68 PAs in the binary case, fixing all variables hg,‘ makes the energy pairwise and the potentials metric, and techniques such as the α-expansion algorithm [6] apply. [sent-163, score-0.683]
</p><p>69 The multi-label model can be reduced to a nonsubmodular pairwise model analogous to the binary model. [sent-166, score-0.216]
</p><p>70 The expansion move algorithm for cooperative multiple-label potentials of the form (5) returns a solution x that is a 2c-approximation to the optimal solution x∗: E(x) ≤ 2cE(x∗), for c =  F‘01(0)/F‘02(Pij∈Eg θij). [sent-169, score-0.745]
</p><p>71 The example results in Figure 5 show that label-sensitive coupling improves detailed segmentations in the multi-label case too. [sent-172, score-0.159]
</p><p>72 In the experiments, we use piece-wise linear coupling functions F with one breakpoint of the form Ψg (x) =  (12)  λminiXj∈Egθij(xi− xj)+,ijX∈Egαθij(xi− xj)++ θg pwahrearme θtgers= ha ϑveP thiej∈ foElglθowij,ing and ef ϑe,cαt: λ ∈ co (n0t,ro1l]s. [sent-178, score-0.234]

</p><p>79 Moreover, these results demonstrate that not only an approximate minimum as in [11], but in particular the global minimum of the cooperative cut energy results in very low errors, especially compared to the standard model. [sent-241, score-0.78]

</p><p>82 Therefore, Figure 5 only shows example quantitative results that nevertheless suggest beneficial effects of edge coupling for detailed multi-label segmentations too. [sent-255, score-0.202]

</p><p>85 Parameters are chosen in such a way that the global minimum of the energy has maximum Hamming accuracy: λ = 1. [sent-277, score-0.172]
</p><p>86 The algorithm solves the class of cooperative cut potentials proposed in [11] exactly or within a factor of (1 ? [sent-288, score-0.847]
</p><p>87 ) and thereby admits to show that not only an approximate solution (as in [11]), but also the true MAP solution of those potentials overcomes the short-boundary bias that poses severe problems to the standard pairwise model for image segmentation. [sent-289, score-0.528]
</p><p>88 The exact algorithm does not violate the NPhardness of cooperative cuts. [sent-292, score-0.419]
</p><p>89 Instead, it demonstrates that the potentials (5) are fixed-parameter tractable: if the number ofedge groups is assumed to be constant (and in practice  it is small), then the algorithm runs in polynomial-time. [sent-293, score-0.337]

</p><p>92 The Pn functions defined in Equations (14) and (15) in [12] are of the form (5) here, and shown to be amenable to expansion moves if the pairwise potentials form a semi-metric. [sent-300, score-0.526]
</p><p>93 In addition, the formulation here does not require general submodular minimization (which can be impractical and also does not in general apply if asymmetric potentials are used). [sent-302, score-0.443]
</p><p>94 The explicit hierarchical formulation in Figure 2 shows that the higher-order potentials for improved segmentations can be expressed as a deep multi-layer pairwise model with additional hidden (auxiliary) variables. [sent-305, score-0.552]

<p>Author: Neill D.F. Campbell, Kartic Subr, Jan Kautz</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are used for diverse tasks, ranging from image denoising to object recognition. For images, they are commonly defined as a graph with nodes corresponding to individual pixels and pairwise links that connect nodes to their immediate neighbors. Recent work has shown that fully-connected CRFs, where each node is connected to every other node, can be solved efficiently under the restriction that the pairwise term is a Gaussian kernel over a Euclidean feature space. In this paper, we generalize the pairwise terms to a non-linear dissimilarity measure that is not required to be a distance metric. To this end, we propose a density estimation technique to derive conditional pairwise potentials in a nonparametric manner. We then use an efficient embedding technique to estimate an approximate Euclidean feature space for these potentials, in which the pairwise term can still be expressed as a Gaussian kernel. We demonstrate that the use of non-parametric models for the pairwise interactions, conditioned on the input data, greatly increases expressive power whilst maintaining efficient inference.</p><p>3 0.21046665 <a title="24-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Joint_3D_Scene_Reconstruction_and_Class_Segmentation.html">230 cvpr-2013-Joint 3D Scene Reconstruction and Class Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Häne, Christopher Zach, Andrea Cohen, Roland Angst, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Both image segmentation and dense 3D modeling from images represent an intrinsically ill-posed problem. Strong regularizers are therefore required to constrain the solutions from being ’too noisy’. Unfortunately, these priors generally yield overly smooth reconstructions and/or segmentations in certain regions whereas they fail in other areas to constrain the solution sufficiently. In this paper we argue that image segmentation and dense 3D reconstruction contribute valuable information to each other’s task. As a consequence, we propose a rigorous mathematical framework to formulate and solve a joint segmentation and dense reconstruction problem. Image segmentations provide geometric cues about which surface orientations are more likely to appear at a certain location in space whereas a dense 3D reconstruction yields a suitable regularization for the segmentation problem by lifting the labeling from 2D images to 3D space. We show how appearance-based cues and 3D surface orientation priors can be learned from training data and subsequently used for class-specific regularization. Experimental results on several real data sets highlight the advantages of our joint formulation.</p><p>4 0.2050111 <a title="24-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploring_Compositional_High_Order_Pattern_Potentials_for_Structured_Output_Learning.html">156 cvpr-2013-Exploring Compositional High Order Pattern Potentials for Structured Output Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Yujia Li, Daniel Tarlow, Richard Zemel</p><p>Abstract: When modeling structured outputs such as image segmentations, prediction can be improved by accurately modeling structure present in the labels. A key challenge is developing tractable models that are able to capture complex high level structure like shape. In this work, we study the learning of a general class of pattern-like high order potential, which we call Compositional High Order Pattern Potentials (CHOPPs). We show that CHOPPs include the linear deviation pattern potentials of Rother et al. [26] and also Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs); we also establish the near equivalence of these two models. Experimentally, we show that performance is affected significantly by the degree of variability present in the datasets, and we define a quantitative variability measure to aid in studying this. We then improve CHOPPs performance in high variability datasets with two primary contributions: (a) developing a loss-sensitive joint learning procedure, so that internal pattern parameters can be learned in conjunction with other model potentials to minimize expected loss;and (b) learning an image-dependent mapping that encourages or inhibits patterns depending on image features. We also explore varying how multiple patterns are composed, and learning convolutional patterns. Quantitative results on challenging highly variable datasets show that the joint learning and image-dependent high order potentials can improve performance.</p><p>5 0.19698168 <a title="24-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Analyzing_Semantic_Segmentation_Using_Hybrid_Human-Machine_CRFs.html">43 cvpr-2013-Analyzing Semantic Segmentation Using Hybrid Human-Machine CRFs</a></p>
<p>Author: Roozbeh Mottaghi, Sanja Fidler, Jian Yao, Raquel Urtasun, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Recent trends in semantic image segmentation have pushed for holistic scene understanding models that jointly reason about various tasks such as object detection, scene recognition, shape analysis, contextual reasoning. In this work, we are interested in understanding the roles of these different tasks in aiding semantic segmentation. Towards this goal, we “plug-in ” human subjects for each of the various components in a state-of-the-art conditional random field model (CRF) on the MSRC dataset. Comparisons among various hybrid human-machine CRFs give us indications of how much “head room ” there is to improve segmentation by focusing research efforts on each of the tasks. One of the interesting findings from our slew of studies was that human classification of isolated super-pixels, while being worse than current machine classifiers, provides a significant boost in performance when plugged into the CRF! Fascinated by this finding, we conducted in depth analysis of the human generated potentials. This inspired a new machine potential which significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on the MRSC dataset.</p><p>6 0.1925763 <a title="24-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>

<p>Author: Neill D.F. Campbell, Kartic Subr, Jan Kautz</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are used for diverse tasks, ranging from image denoising to object recognition. For images, they are commonly defined as a graph with nodes corresponding to individual pixels and pairwise links that connect nodes to their immediate neighbors. Recent work has shown that fully-connected CRFs, where each node is connected to every other node, can be solved efficiently under the restriction that the pairwise term is a Gaussian kernel over a Euclidean feature space. In this paper, we generalize the pairwise terms to a non-linear dissimilarity measure that is not required to be a distance metric. To this end, we propose a density estimation technique to derive conditional pairwise potentials in a nonparametric manner. We then use an efficient embedding technique to estimate an approximate Euclidean feature space for these potentials, in which the pairwise term can still be expressed as a Gaussian kernel. We demonstrate that the use of non-parametric models for the pairwise interactions, conditioned on the input data, greatly increases expressive power whilst maintaining efficient inference.</p><p>3 0.75485194 <a title="24-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>4 0.7259779 <a title="24-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploring_Compositional_High_Order_Pattern_Potentials_for_Structured_Output_Learning.html">156 cvpr-2013-Exploring Compositional High Order Pattern Potentials for Structured Output Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Rui Shi, Wei Zeng, Zhengyu Su, Hanna Damasio, Zhonglin Lu, Yalin Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is an active research field in computer vision, computer graphics and computational geometry. It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquer this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric, so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on the Ricci flow method and the method is general and robust. We apply our algorithm to study constrained human brain surface registration problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic, and achieve relative high performance when evaluated with some popular cortical surface registration evaluation standards.</p><p>2 0.89154118 <a title="24-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_and_Naming_Actors_in_Movies_Using_Generative_Appearance_Models.html">120 cvpr-2013-Detecting and Naming Actors in Movies Using Generative Appearance Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Kota Hara, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical method for human pose estimation from a single still image. In our approach, a dependency graph representing relationships between reference points such as bodyjoints is constructed and thepositions of these reference points are sequentially estimated by a successive application of multidimensional output regressions along the dependency paths, starting from the root node. Each regressor takes image features computed from an image patch centered on the current node ’s position estimated by the previous regressor and is specialized for estimating its child nodes ’ positions. The use of the dependency graph allows us to decompose a complex pose estimation problem into a set of local pose estimation problems that are less complex. We design a dependency graph for two commonly used human pose estimation datasets, the Buffy Stickmen dataset and the ETHZ PASCAL Stickmen dataset, and demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art results on both datasets with significantly lower computation time than existing methods. Furthermore, we propose an importance weighted boosted re- gression trees method for transductive learning settings and demonstrate the resulting improved performance for pose estimation tasks.</p><p>6 0.85495663 <a title="24-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Salient_Object_Detection%3A_A_Discriminative_Regional_Feature_Integration_Approach.html">376 cvpr-2013-Salient Object Detection: A Discriminative Regional Feature Integration Approach</a></p>

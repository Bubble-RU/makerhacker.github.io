<p>Author: Christian Häne, Christopher Zach, Andrea Cohen, Roland Angst, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Both image segmentation and dense 3D modeling from images represent an intrinsically ill-posed problem. Strong regularizers are therefore required to constrain the solutions from being ’too noisy’. Unfortunately, these priors generally yield overly smooth reconstructions and/or segmentations in certain regions whereas they fail in other areas to constrain the solution sufficiently. In this paper we argue that image segmentation and dense 3D reconstruction contribute valuable information to each other’s task. As a consequence, we propose a rigorous mathematical framework to formulate and solve a joint segmentation and dense reconstruction problem. Image segmentations provide geometric cues about which surface orientations are more likely to appear at a certain location in space whereas a dense 3D reconstruction yields a suitable regularization for the segmentation problem by lifting the labeling from 2D images to 3D space. We show how appearance-based cues and 3D surface orientation priors can be learned from training data and subsequently used for class-specific regularization. Experimental results on several real data sets highlight the advantages of our joint formulation.</p><p>3 0.19877408 <a title="24-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>4 0.17656048 <a title="24-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Fully-Connected_CRFs_with_Non-Parametric_Pairwise_Potential.html">180 cvpr-2013-Fully-Connected CRFs with Non-Parametric Pairwise Potential</a></p>
<p>Author: Neill D.F. Campbell, Kartic Subr, Jan Kautz</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are used for diverse tasks, ranging from image denoising to object recognition. For images, they are commonly defined as a graph with nodes corresponding to individual pixels and pairwise links that connect nodes to their immediate neighbors. Recent work has shown that fully-connected CRFs, where each node is connected to every other node, can be solved efficiently under the restriction that the pairwise term is a Gaussian kernel over a Euclidean feature space. In this paper, we generalize the pairwise terms to a non-linear dissimilarity measure that is not required to be a distance metric. To this end, we propose a density estimation technique to derive conditional pairwise potentials in a nonparametric manner. We then use an efficient embedding technique to estimate an approximate Euclidean feature space for these potentials, in which the pairwise term can still be expressed as a Gaussian kernel. We demonstrate that the use of non-parametric models for the pairwise interactions, conditioned on the input data, greatly increases expressive power whilst maintaining efficient inference.</p><p>5 0.1574419 <a title="24-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Simultaneous_Super-Resolution_of_Depth_and_Images_Using_a_Single_Camera.html">397 cvpr-2013-Simultaneous Super-Resolution of Depth and Images Using a Single Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Hee Seok Lee, Kuoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a convex optimization framework for simultaneous estimation of super-resolved depth map and images from a single moving camera. The pixel measurement error in 3D reconstruction is directly related to the resolution of the images at hand. In turn, even a small measurement error can cause significant errors in reconstructing 3D scene structure or camera pose. Therefore, enhancing image resolution can be an effective solution for securing the accuracy as well as the resolution of 3D reconstruction. In the proposed method, depth map estimation and image super-resolution are formulated in a single energy minimization framework with a convex function and solved efficiently by a first-order primal-dual algorithm. Explicit inter-frame pixel correspondences are not required for our super-resolution procedure, thus we can avoid a huge computation time and obtain improved depth map in the accuracy and resolution as well as highresolution images with reasonable time. The superiority of our algorithm is demonstrated by presenting the improved depth map accuracy, image super-resolution results, and camera pose estimation.</p><p>6 0.13670179 <a title="24-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Composite_Statistical_Inference_for_Semantic_Segmentation.html">86 cvpr-2013-Composite Statistical Inference for Semantic Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jörg Hendrik Kappes, Markus Speth, Gerhard Reinelt, Christoph Schnörr</p><p>Abstract: Discrete graphical models (also known as discrete Markov random fields) are a major conceptual tool to model the structure of optimization problems in computer vision. While in the last decade research has focused on fast approximative methods, algorithms that provide globally optimal solutions have come more into the research focus in the last years. However, large scale computer vision problems seemed to be out of reach for such methods. In this paper we introduce a promising way to bridge this gap based on partial optimality and structural properties of the underlying problem factorization. Combining these preprocessing steps, we are able to solve grids of size 2048 2048 in less than 90 seconds. On the hitherto unsolva2b04le8 C×h2i0ne4s8e character dataset of Nowozin et al. we obtain provably optimal results in 56% of the instances and achieve competitive runtimes on other recent benchmark problems. While in the present work only generalized Potts models are considered, an extension to general graphical models seems to be feasible.</p><p>3 0.76006371 <a title="24-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Continuous_Inference_in_Graphical_Models_with_Polynomial_Energies.html">95 cvpr-2013-Continuous Inference in Graphical Models with Polynomial Energies</a></p>
<p>Author: Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of performing inference in graphical models whose energy is a polynomial function of continuous variables. Our energy minimization method follows a dual decomposition approach, where the global problem is split into subproblems defined over the graph cliques. The optimal solution to these subproblems is obtained by making use of a polynomial system solver. Our algorithm inherits the convergence guarantees of dual decomposition. To speed up optimization, we also introduce a variant of this algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian method. Our experiments illustrate the diversity of computer vision problems that can be expressed with polynomial energies, and demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing continuous inference methods.</p><p>4 0.72391146 <a title="24-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Comparative_Study_of_Modern_Inference_Techniques_for_Discrete_Energy_Minimization_Problems.html">6 cvpr-2013-A Comparative Study of Modern Inference Techniques for Discrete Energy Minimization Problems</a></p>

Kausler, Jan Lellmann, Nikos Komodakis, Carsten Rother</p><p>Abstract: Seven years ago, Szeliski et al. published an influential study on energy minimization methods for Markov random fields (MRF). This study provided valuable insights in choosing the best optimization technique for certain classes of problems. While these insights remain generally useful today, the phenominal success of random field models means that the kinds of inference problems we solve have changed significantly. Specifically, the models today often include higher order interactions, flexible connectivity structures, large label-spaces of different cardinalities, or learned energy tables. To reflect these changes, we provide a modernized and enlarged study. We present an empirical comparison of 24 state-of-art techniques on a corpus of 2,300 energy minimization instances from 20 diverse computer vision applications. To ensure reproducibility, we evaluate all methods in the OpenGM2 framework and report extensive results regarding runtime and solution quality. Key insights from our study agree with the results of Szeliski et al. for the types of models they studied. However, on new and challenging types of models our findings disagree and suggest that polyhedral methods and integer programming solvers are competitive in terms of runtime and solution quality over a large range of model types.</p><p>5 0.72149783 <a title="24-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Universality_of_the_Local_Marginal_Polytope.html">448 cvpr-2013-Universality of the Local Marginal Polytope</a></p>

<p>Author: Long Mai, Yuzhen Niu, Feng Liu</p><p>Abstract: A variety of methods have been developed for visual saliency analysis. These methods often complement each other. This paper addresses the problem of aggregating various saliency analysis methods such that the aggregation result outperforms each individual one. We have two major observations. First, different methods perform differently in saliency analysis. Second, the performance of a saliency analysis method varies with individual images. Our idea is to use data-driven approaches to saliency aggregation that appropriately consider the performance gaps among individual methods and the performance dependence of each method on individual images. This paper discusses various data-driven approaches and finds that the image-dependent aggregation method works best. Specifically, our method uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework for saliency aggregation that not only models the contribution from individual saliency map but also the interaction between neighboringpixels. To account for the dependence of aggregation on an individual image, our approach selects a subset of images similar to the input image from a training data set and trains the CRF aggregation model only using this subset instead of the whole training set. Our experiments on public saliency benchmarks show that our aggregation method outperforms each individual saliency method and is robust with the selection of aggregated methods.</p><p>2 0.92863154 <a title="24-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-CLAM%3A_Coupled_Localization_and_Mapping_with_Efficient_Outlier_Handling.html">74 cvpr-2013-CLAM: Coupled Localization and Mapping with Efficient Outlier Handling</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Balzer, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method to efficiently generate a model (map) of small-scale objects from video. The map encodes sparse geometry as well as coarse photometry, and could be used to initialize dense reconstruction schemes as well as to support recognition and localization of three-dimensional objects. Self-occlusions and the predominance of outliers present a challenge to existing online Structure From Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping systems. We propose a unified inference criterion that encompasses map building and localization (object detection) relative to the map in a coupled fashion. We establish correspondence in a computationally efficient way without resorting to combinatorial matching or random-sampling techniques. Instead, we use a simpler M-estimator that exploits putative correspondence from tracking after photometric and topological validation. We have collected a new dataset to benchmark model building in the small scale, which we test our algorithm on in comparison to others. Although our system is significantly leaner than previous ones, it compares favorably to the state of the art in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p><p>3 0.9128955 <a title="24-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Practical_Rank-Constrained_Eight-Point_Algorithm_for_Fundamental_Matrix_Estimation.html">23 cvpr-2013-A Practical Rank-Constrained Eight-Point Algorithm for Fundamental Matrix Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yinqiang Zheng, Shigeki Sugimoto, Masatoshi Okutomi</p><p>Abstract: Due to its simplicity, the eight-point algorithm has been widely used in fundamental matrix estimation. Unfortunately, the rank-2 constraint of a fundamental matrix is enforced via a posterior rank correction step, thus leading to non-optimal solutions to the original problem. To address this drawback, existing algorithms need to solve either a very high order polynomial or a sequence of convex relaxation problems, both of which are computationally ineffective and numerically unstable. In this work, we present a new rank-2 constrained eight-point algorithm, which directly incorporates the rank-2 constraint in the minimization process. To avoid singularities, we propose to solve seven subproblems and retrieve their globally optimal solutions by using tailored polynomial system solvers. Our proposed method is noniterative, computationally efficient and numerically stable. Experiment results have verified its superiority over existing algebraic error based algorithms in terms of accuracy, as well as its advantages when used to initialize geometric error based algorithms.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.90600312 <a title="24-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Principled_Deep_Random_Field_Model_for_Image_Segmentation.html">24 cvpr-2013-A Principled Deep Random Field Model for Image Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Pushmeet Kohli, Anton Osokin, Stefanie Jegelka</p><p>Abstract: We discuss a model for image segmentation that is able to overcome the short-boundary bias observed in standard pairwise random field based approaches. To wit, we show that a random field with multi-layered hidden units can encode boundary preserving higher order potentials such as the ones used in the cooperative cuts model of [11] while still allowing for fast and exact MAP inference. Exact inference allows our model to outperform previous image segmentation methods, and to see the true effect of coupling graph edges. Finally, our model can be easily extended to handle segmentation instances with multiple labels, for which it yields promising results.</p><p>5 0.88401133 <a title="24-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-FrameBreak%3A_Dramatic_Image_Extrapolation_by_Guided_Shift-Maps.html">177 cvpr-2013-FrameBreak: Dramatic Image Extrapolation by Guided Shift-Maps</a></p>
<p>Author: Yinda Zhang, Jianxiong Xiao, James Hays, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We significantly extrapolate the field of view of a photograph by learning from a roughly aligned, wide-angle guide image of the same scene category. Our method can extrapolate typical photos into complete panoramas. The extrapolation problem is formulated in the shift-map image synthesis framework. We analyze the self-similarity of the guide image to generate a set of allowable local transformations and apply them to the input image. Our guided shift-map method preserves to the scene layout of the guide image when extrapolating a photograph. While conventional shiftmap methods only support translations, this is not expressive enough to characterize the self-similarity of complex scenes. Therefore we additionally allow image transformations of rotation, scaling and reflection. To handle this in- crease in complexity, we introduce a hierarchical graph optimization method to choose the optimal transformation at each output pixel. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of indoor, outdoor, natural, and man-made scenes.</p><p>6 0.87099874 <a title="24-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Deformable_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Fast_Dense_Correspondences.html">107 cvpr-2013-Deformable Spatial Pyramid Matching for Fast Dense Correspondences</a></p>

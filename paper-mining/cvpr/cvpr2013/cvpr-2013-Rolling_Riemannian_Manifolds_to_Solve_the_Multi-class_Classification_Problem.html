</p><p>8 Introduction Applications in computer vision often involve the study of real world problems where the nonlinear constraints lead to data that lies on curved spaces [19, 28, 3]. [sent-11, score-0.069]
</p><p>9 When treating cases that cannot be solved within the standard Euclidean tools, it is usual to resort to some local linear approximations or to use ad hoc solutions. [sent-12, score-0.027]
</p><p>10 Those solutions are not always valid, which poses a challenge for several computer vision applications where data often lies in complex manifolds, namely in Riemannian manifolds i. [sent-13, score-0.256]
</p><p>11 Prior Work : Recently, the development of geometric frameworks to learn supervised classification models on Riemannian manifolds has been addressed in the computer vision community [3 1, 27]. [sent-23, score-0.395]
</p><p>12 This classifier is an additive model, where a set of weak learners are built by regression over the  mappings of the data points on appropriate tangent planes (at the Karcher mean of the positive training points) and combined through boosting. [sent-26, score-0.176]
</p><p>13 The consideration of the negative samples in the mean computation would bias the result, since they are assumed to be spread on the manifold [3 1, 27]. [sent-27, score-0.343]
</p><p>14 This framework was tested to detect pedestrians in images using as descriptor a region covariance matrix [30] (Sym+ - symmetric positive definite matrices), but the algorithm is valid over any Riemannian manifold and can be combined with several different boosting (classification) methods. [sent-28, score-0.456]
</p><p>15 Learning problems on Riemannian manifolds are generally solved by flattening the manifold via local diffeomorphisms [5], i. [sent-30, score-0.758]
</p><p>16 the manifold is locally embedded into an Euclidean space. [sent-32, score-0.294]
</p><p>17 However, embedding the manifold using those local diffeomorphisms leads to some problems. [sent-33, score-0.446]
</p><p>18 The exponential map is onto but only one-to-one in a neighborhood of a point. [sent-34, score-0.061]
</p><p>19 444111  whole manifold look like an Euclidean space. [sent-38, score-0.294]
</p><p>20 [27] : once we try to change the paradigm from binary to multi-class classification the Tuzel’s framework [3 1] is not valid anymore due to the spread of multiple positive classes on the manifold. [sent-40, score-0.31]
</p><p>21 From this perspective, it is natural to see efforts for solve this bottleneck. [sent-41, score-0.027]
</p><p>22 Tuzel [3 1] endowed the Sym+ manifold with the well-known AffineInvariant metric, however a thorough analysis of this space opens a new perspective. [sent-42, score-0.393]
</p><p>23 The space of Sym+ is a special Riemannian manifold since there is another metric, called Log-Euclidean [1], which allows to overcome the above limitations. [sent-43, score-0.328]
</p><p>24 As showed in [1] the simple matrix exponential (exp) is a diffeomorphism from the Euclidean space of symmetric matrices to the Sym+ space. [sent-44, score-0.153]
</p><p>25 The space of Sym+ endowed with a Log-Euclidean metric is in fact isomorphic (the algebraic structure of vector space is conserved) and isometric (distances are conserved) with the corresponding Euclidean space of symmetric matrices [1], i. [sent-45, score-0.404]
</p><p>26 the LogEuclidean framework defines a mapping where the space of Sym+ is isomorphic, diffeomorphic and isometric to the associated space of symmetric matrices [1]. [sent-47, score-0.234]
</p><p>27 This mapping is precisely the simple matrix logarithm (log), which can be seen as the logarithm map at the identity [1]. [sent-48, score-0.155]
</p><p>28 By endowing the space of Sym+ with the Log-Euclidean metric, Tosato et al. [sent-49, score-0.104]
</p><p>29 [27] proposed a mathematically wellfounded multi-class framework designed to operate on this particular manifold (Sym+). [sent-50, score-0.416]
</p><p>30 All the data is projected onto a unique tangent space at the identity (simple matrix logarithm), where a typical multi-class LogitBoost algorithm is applied [7]. [sent-51, score-0.302]
</p><p>31 [2] also embedded all the Sym+ manifold into an Euclidean space by endowing Sym+ with the Log-Euclidean metric to perform multiclass classification using linear SVM. [sent-53, score-0.481]
</p><p>32 However, the Tosato/Carreira’s paradigm [27, 2] (embed all the manifold) is not generalizable in the sense that it cannot be applied to other Riemannian manifolds due to the specificity of the mapping/metric used. [sent-55, score-0.381]
</p><p>33 It is then natural to ask whether the multi-class concept could be extended to operate on a large class of Riemannian manifolds. [sent-56, score-0.126]
</p><p>34 Recently a new school of thought emerged [11, 12, 13, 5]. [sent-57, score-0.098]
</p><p>35 This new paradigm suggests to embed the Riemannian manifold into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) by using Mercer kernels on Riemannian manifolds. [sent-58, score-0.479]
</p><p>36 [11, 12] proposed to use specific Grassmann kernels in order to embed the Grassmann manifold into a RKHS. [sent-60, score-0.384]
</p><p>37 [13] used the Stein kernel to perform sparse coding and dictionary learning for symmetric positive definite matrices. [sent-62, score-0.131]
</p><p>38 [5] proposed a novel kernel-based mean shift on general Riemannian man444222 ifolds, by using a general Riemannian kernel function, i. [sent-64, score-0.035]
</p><p>39 However, the use of kernel-based algorithms for build classifiers on general Riemannian manifolds is not a good option. [sent-67, score-0.256]
</p><p>40 Firstly, to our knowledge the heat kernel is the unique Mercer kernel suited to general Rieman-  nian manifolds. [sent-68, score-0.135]
</p><p>41 Secondly, the calculation of the heat kernel constitute a complex theoretical/technical problem and the computational burden is high. [sent-69, score-0.1]
</p><p>42 Finally, by using Mercer kernels to implicitly project the data from the manifold we are restricted to use kernel-based classifiers. [sent-70, score-0.361]
</p><p>43 The idea is to project all the data from the manifold onto an affine tangent space at a particular point (e. [sent-72, score-0.672]
</p><p>44 To mitigate the distortion induced by local diffeomorphisms, we introduce for the first time in the computer vison community a well-founded mathematical concept, so-called Rolling map [16, 21]. [sent-75, score-0.139]
</p><p>45 The novelty in this alternate school of thought is that the manifold will be firstly rolled (without slip and twist) as a rigid body, then the given data is unwrapped onto the affine tangent space, where the classification is performed. [sent-76, score-1.186]
</p><p>46 For the sake of brevity the proof of concept will be done by testing with a multi-class LogitBoost algorithm [27, 7] on the Grassmann manifold [6, 25, 29, 28, 12, 16, 24]. [sent-77, score-0.339]
</p><p>47 We remark that our paradigm is also valid with others Riemannian manifolds. [sent-78, score-0.161]
</p><p>48 Rolling Maps on Riemannian Manifolds In the past few years there has been a growing interest in  describing mathematically rolling motions, without slip and twist, of smooth manifolds (due to its analytic and geometric richness) [21, 15, 22, 16]. [sent-80, score-0.847]
</p><p>49 The study of these kinematic problems proved to be relevant, in part because the knowledge on how to realize such virtual movements allows to solve complicated problems on certain manifolds, by reducing them to similar problems on much simpler manifolds. [sent-81, score-0.144]
</p><p>50 For example, those rolling movements have been used with great success to compute interpolating curves and solve other optimal control problems on manifolds [15, 22, 16]. [sent-82, score-0.731]
</p><p>51 The resulting curve is defined in explicit form, and has the advantage of being coordinate free [15, 16]. [sent-84, score-0.036]

<p>Author: Raviteja Vemulapalli, Jaishanker K. Pillai, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: In computer vision applications, features often lie on Riemannian manifolds with known geometry. Popular learning algorithms such as discriminant analysis, partial least squares, support vector machines, etc., are not directly applicable to such features due to the non-Euclidean nature of the underlying spaces. Hence, classification is often performed in an extrinsic manner by mapping the manifolds to Euclidean spaces using kernels. However, for kernel based approaches, poor choice of kernel often results in reduced performance. In this paper, we address the issue of kernelselection for the classification of features that lie on Riemannian manifolds using the kernel learning approach. We propose two criteria for jointly learning the kernel and the classifier using a single optimization problem. Specifically, for the SVM classifier, we formulate the problem of learning a good kernel-classifier combination as a convex optimization problem and solve it efficiently following the multiple kernel learning approach. Experimental results on image set-based classification and activity recognition clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods for classification of manifold features.</p><p>3 0.33935282 <a title="367-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Kernel_Methods_on_the_Riemannian_Manifold_of_Symmetric_Positive_Definite_Matrices.html">238 cvpr-2013-Kernel Methods on the Riemannian Manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices have become popular to encode image information. Accounting for the geometry of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices has proven key to the success of many algorithms. However, most existing methods only approximate the true shape of the manifold locally by its tangent plane. In this paper, inspired by kernel methods, we propose to map SPD matrices to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To encode the geometry of the manifold in the mapping, we introduce a family of provably positive definite kernels on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. These kernels are derived from the Gaussian kernel, but exploit different metrics on the manifold. This lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM and kernel PCA, to the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the problems of pedestrian detection, object categorization, texture analysis, 2D motion segmentation and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) segmentation.</p><p>4 0.18026564 <a title="367-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Top-Down_Segmentation_of_Non-rigid_Visual_Objects_Using_Derivative-Based_Search_on_Sparse_Manifolds.html">433 cvpr-2013-Top-Down Segmentation of Non-rigid Visual Objects Using Derivative-Based Search on Sparse Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacinto C. Nascimento, Gustavo Carneiro</p><p>Abstract: The solution for the top-down segmentation of non-rigid visual objects using machine learning techniques is generally regarded as too complex to be solved in its full generality given the large dimensionality of the search space of the explicit representation ofthe segmentation contour. In order to reduce this complexity, theproblem is usually divided into two stages: rigid detection and non-rigid segmentation. The rationale is based on the fact that the rigid detection can be run in a lower dimensionality space (i.e., less complex and faster) than the original contour space, and its result is then used to constrain the non-rigid segmentation. In this paper, we propose the use of sparse manifolds to reduce the dimensionality of the rigid detection search space of current stateof-the-art top-down segmentation methodologies. The main goals targeted by this smaller dimensionality search space are the decrease of the search running time complexity and the reduction of the training complexity of the rigid detec- tor. These goals are attainable given that both the search and training complexities are function of the dimensionality of the rigid search space. We test our approach in the segmentation of the left ventricle from ultrasound images and lips from frontal face images. Compared to the performance of state-of-the-art non-rigid segmentation system, our experiments show that the use of sparse manifolds for the rigid detection leads to the two goals mentioned above.</p><p>5 0.14178823 <a title="367-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_a_Manifold_as_an_Atlas.html">259 cvpr-2013-Learning a Manifold as an Atlas</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikolaos Pitelis, Chris Russell, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we return to the underlying mathematical definition of a manifold and directly characterise learning a manifold as finding an atlas, or a set of overlapping charts, that accurately describe local structure. We formulate the problem of learning the manifold as an optimisation that simultaneously refines the continuous parameters defining the charts, and the discrete assignment of points to charts. In contrast to existing methods, this direct formulation of a manifold does not require “unwrapping ” the manifold into a lower dimensional space and allows us to learn closed manifolds of interest to vision, such as those corresponding to gait cycles or camera pose. We report state-ofthe-art results for manifold based nearest neighbour classification on vision datasets, and show how the same techniques can be applied to the 3D reconstruction of human motion from a single image.</p><p>6 0.13092805 <a title="367-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-rigid_Structure_from_Motion_with_Diffusion_Maps_Prior.html">306 cvpr-2013-Non-rigid Structure from Motion with Diffusion Maps Prior</a></p>

<p>Author: Rui Caseiro, Pedro Martins, João F. Henriques, Fátima Silva Leite, Jorge Batista</p><p>Abstract: In the past few years there has been a growing interest on geometric frameworks to learn supervised classification models on Riemannian manifolds [31, 27]. A popular framework, valid over any Riemannian manifold, was proposed in [31] for binary classification. Once moving from binary to multi-class classification thisparadigm is not valid anymore, due to the spread of multiple positive classes on the manifold [27]. It is then natural to ask whether the multi-class paradigm could be extended to operate on a large class of Riemannian manifolds. We propose a mathematically well-founded classification paradigm that allows to extend the work in [31] to multi-class models, taking into account the structure of the space. The idea is to project all the data from the manifold onto an affine tangent space at a particular point. To mitigate the distortion induced by local diffeomorphisms, we introduce for the first time in the computer vision community a well-founded mathematical concept, so-called Rolling map [21, 16]. The novelty in this alternate school of thought is that the manifold will be firstly rolled (without slipping or twisting) as a rigid body, then the given data is unwrapped onto the affine tangent space, where the classification is performed.</p><p>2 0.86971885 <a title="367-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Kernel_Methods_on_the_Riemannian_Manifold_of_Symmetric_Positive_Definite_Matrices.html">238 cvpr-2013-Kernel Methods on the Riemannian Manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Sadeep Jayasumana, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi</p><p>Abstract: Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices have become popular to encode image information. Accounting for the geometry of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices has proven key to the success of many algorithms. However, most existing methods only approximate the true shape of the manifold locally by its tangent plane. In this paper, inspired by kernel methods, we propose to map SPD matrices to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To encode the geometry of the manifold in the mapping, we introduce a family of provably positive definite kernels on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. These kernels are derived from the Gaussian kernel, but exploit different metrics on the manifold. This lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM and kernel PCA, to the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the problems of pedestrian detection, object categorization, texture analysis, 2D motion segmentation and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) segmentation.</p><p>3 0.80950874 <a title="367-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Kernel_Learning_for_Extrinsic_Classification_of_Manifold_Features.html">237 cvpr-2013-Kernel Learning for Extrinsic Classification of Manifold Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Raviteja Vemulapalli, Jaishanker K. Pillai, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: In computer vision applications, features often lie on Riemannian manifolds with known geometry. Popular learning algorithms such as discriminant analysis, partial least squares, support vector machines, etc., are not directly applicable to such features due to the non-Euclidean nature of the underlying spaces. Hence, classification is often performed in an extrinsic manner by mapping the manifolds to Euclidean spaces using kernels. However, for kernel based approaches, poor choice of kernel often results in reduced performance. In this paper, we address the issue of kernelselection for the classification of features that lie on Riemannian manifolds using the kernel learning approach. We propose two criteria for jointly learning the kernel and the classifier using a single optimization problem. Specifically, for the SVM classifier, we formulate the problem of learning a good kernel-classifier combination as a convex optimization problem and solve it efficiently following the multiple kernel learning approach. Experimental results on image set-based classification and activity recognition clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods for classification of manifold features.</p><p>4 0.79248548 <a title="367-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-MKPLS%3A_Manifold_Kernel_Partial_Least_Squares_for_Lipreading_and_Speaker_Identification.html">276 cvpr-2013-MKPLS: Manifold Kernel Partial Least Squares for Lipreading and Speaker Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Amr Bakry, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a challenging problem, due to confusion between visual speech features. The speaker identification problem is usually coupled with speech recognition. Moreover, speaker identification is important to several applications, such as automatic access control, biometrics, authentication, and personal privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for lipreading and speaker identification. Wepropose a new approachfor manifold parameterization in a low-dimensional latent space, where each manifold is represented as a point in that space. We initially parameterize each instance manifold using a nonlinear mapping from a unified manifold representation. We then factorize the parameter space using Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) to achieve a low-dimension manifold latent space. We use two-way projections to achieve two manifold latent spaces, one for the speech content and one for the speaker. We apply our approach on two public databases: AVLetters and OuluVS. We show the results for three different settings of lipreading: speaker independent, speaker dependent, and speaker semi-dependent. Our approach outperforms for the speaker semi-dependent setting by at least 15% of the baseline, and competes in the other two settings.</p><p>5 0.75415581 <a title="367-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_a_Manifold_as_an_Atlas.html">259 cvpr-2013-Learning a Manifold as an Atlas</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikolaos Pitelis, Chris Russell, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we return to the underlying mathematical definition of a manifold and directly characterise learning a manifold as finding an atlas, or a set of overlapping charts, that accurately describe local structure. We formulate the problem of learning the manifold as an optimisation that simultaneously refines the continuous parameters defining the charts, and the discrete assignment of points to charts. In contrast to existing methods, this direct formulation of a manifold does not require “unwrapping ” the manifold into a lower dimensional space and allows us to learn closed manifolds of interest to vision, such as those corresponding to gait cycles or camera pose. We report state-ofthe-art results for manifold based nearest neighbour classification on vision datasets, and show how the same techniques can be applied to the 3D reconstruction of human motion from a single image.</p><p>6 0.59930849 <a title="367-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Top-Down_Segmentation_of_Non-rigid_Visual_Objects_Using_Derivative-Based_Search_on_Sparse_Manifolds.html">433 cvpr-2013-Top-Down Segmentation of Non-rigid Visual Objects Using Derivative-Based Search on Sparse Manifolds</a></p>

<p>Author: Lu Xia, J.K. Aggarwal</p><p>Abstract: Local spatio-temporal interest points (STIPs) and the resulting features from RGB videos have been proven successful at activity recognition that can handle cluttered backgrounds and partial occlusions. In this paper, we propose its counterpart in depth video and show its efficacy on activity recognition. We present a filtering method to extract STIPsfrom depth videos (calledDSTIP) that effectively suppress the noisy measurements. Further, we build a novel depth cuboid similarity feature (DCSF) to describe the local 3D depth cuboid around the DSTIPs with an adaptable supporting size. We test this feature on activity recognition application using the public MSRAction3D, MSRDailyActivity3D datasets and our own dataset. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach outperforms stateof-the-art activity recognition algorithms on depth videos, and the framework is more widely applicable than existing approaches. We also give detailed comparisons with other features and analysis of choice of parameters as a guidance for applications.</p><p>3 0.7125234 <a title="367-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Statistical_Textural_Distinctiveness_for_Salient_Region_Detection_in_Natural_Images.html">411 cvpr-2013-Statistical Textural Distinctiveness for Salient Region Detection in Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Scharfenberger, Alexander Wong, Khalil Fergani, John S. Zelek, David A. Clausi</p><p>Abstract: A novel statistical textural distinctiveness approach for robustly detecting salient regions in natural images is proposed. Rotational-invariant neighborhood-based textural representations are extracted and used to learn a set of representative texture atoms for defining a sparse texture model for the image. Based on the learnt sparse texture model, a weighted graphical model is constructed to characterize the statistical textural distinctiveness between all representative texture atom pairs. Finally, the saliency of each pixel in the image is computed based on the probability of occurrence of the representative texture atoms, their respective statistical textural distinctiveness based on the constructed graphical model, and general visual attentive constraints. Experimental results using a public natural image dataset and a variety of performance evaluation metrics show that the proposed approach provides interesting and promising results when compared to existing saliency detection methods.</p><p>4 0.70207763 <a title="367-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Joint_Model_for_2D_and_3D_Pose_Estimation_from_a_Single_Image.html">14 cvpr-2013-A Joint Model for 2D and 3D Pose Estimation from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Edgar Simo-Serra, Ariadna Quattoni, Carme Torras, Francesc Moreno-Noguer</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to automatically recover 3D human pose from a single image. Most previous work follows a pipelined approach: initially, a set of 2D features such as edges, joints or silhouettes are detected in the image, and then these observations are used to infer the 3D pose. Solving these two problems separately may lead to erroneous 3D poses when the feature detector has performed poorly. In this paper, we address this issue by jointly solving both the 2D detection and the 3D inference problems. For this purpose, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates a generative model based on latent variables and discriminative 2D part detectors based on HOGs, and perform inference using evolutionary algorithms. Real experimentation demonstrates competitive results, and the ability of our methodology to provide accurate 2D and 3D pose estimations even when the 2D detectors are inaccurate.</p><p>5 0.66323286 <a title="367-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Real-Time_Tracking_of_Multiple_Objects_by_Volumetric_Mass_Densities.html">365 cvpr-2013-Robust Real-Time Tracking of Multiple Objects by Volumetric Mass Densities</a></p>
<p>Author: Horst Possegger, Sabine Sternig, Thomas Mauthner, Peter M. Roth, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: Combining foreground images from multiple views by projecting them onto a common ground-plane has been recently applied within many multi-object tracking approaches. These planar projections introduce severe artifacts and constrain most approaches to objects moving on a common 2D ground-plane. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of an occupancy volume exploiting the full geometry and the objects ’ center of mass and develop an efficient algorithm for 3D object tracking. Individual objects are tracked using the local mass density scores within a particle filter based approach, constrained by a Voronoi partitioning between nearby trackers. Our method benefits from the geometric knowledge given by the occupancy volume to robustly extract features and train classifiers on-demand, when volumetric information becomes unreliable. We evaluate our approach on several challenging real-world scenarios including the public APIDIS dataset. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-theart methods, while achieving real-time performance. – –</p><p>6 0.66304123 <a title="367-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Intrinsic_Scene_Properties_from_a_Single_RGB-D_Image.html">227 cvpr-2013-Intrinsic Scene Properties from a Single RGB-D Image</a></p>

<p>Author: Yinda Zhang, Jianxiong Xiao, James Hays, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We significantly extrapolate the field of view of a photograph by learning from a roughly aligned, wide-angle guide image of the same scene category. Our method can extrapolate typical photos into complete panoramas. The extrapolation problem is formulated in the shift-map image synthesis framework. We analyze the self-similarity of the guide image to generate a set of allowable local transformations and apply them to the input image. Our guided shift-map method preserves to the scene layout of the guide image when extrapolating a photograph. While conventional shiftmap methods only support translations, this is not expressive enough to characterize the self-similarity of complex scenes. Therefore we additionally allow image transformations of rotation, scaling and reflection. To handle this in- crease in complexity, we introduce a hierarchical graph optimization method to choose the optimal transformation at each output pixel. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of indoor, outdoor, natural, and man-made scenes.</p><p>3 0.18771315 <a title="81-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_Changes_in_3D_Structure_of_a_Scene_from_Multi-view_Images_Captured_by_a_Vehicle-Mounted_Camera.html">117 cvpr-2013-Detecting Changes in 3D Structure of a Scene from Multi-view Images Captured by a Vehicle-Mounted Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Ken Sakurada, Takayuki Okatani, Koichiro Deguchi</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for detecting temporal changes of the three-dimensional structure of an outdoor scene from its multi-view images captured at two separate times. For the images, we consider those captured by a camera mounted on a vehicle running in a city street. The method estimates scene structures probabilistically, not deterministically, and based on their estimates, it evaluates the probability of structural changes in the scene, where the inputs are the similarity of the local image patches among the multi-view images. The aim of the probabilistic treatment is to maximize the accuracy of change detection, behind which there is our conjecture that although it is difficult to estimate the scene structures deterministically, it should be easier to detect their changes. The proposed method is compared with the methods that use multi-view stereo (MVS) to reconstruct the scene structures of the two time points and then differentiate them to detect changes. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms such MVS-based methods.</p><p>4 0.145522 <a title="81-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Megastereo%3A_Constructing_High-Resolution_Stereo_Panoramas.html">283 cvpr-2013-Megastereo: Constructing High-Resolution Stereo Panoramas</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Richardt, Yael Pritch, Henning Zimmer, Alexander Sorkine-Hornung</p><p>Abstract: We present a solution for generating high-quality stereo panoramas at megapixel resolutions. While previous approaches introduced the basic principles, we show that those techniques do not generalise well to today’s high image resolutions and lead to disturbing visual artefacts. As our first contribution, we describe the necessary correction steps and a compact representation for the input images in order to achieve a highly accurate approximation to the required ray space. Our second contribution is a flow-based upsampling of the available input rays which effectively resolves known aliasing issues like stitching artefacts. The required rays are generated on the fly to perfectly match the desired output resolution, even for small numbers of input images. In addition, the upsampling is real-time and enables direct interactive control over the desired stereoscopic depth effect. In combination, our contributions allow the generation of stereoscopic panoramas at high output resolutions that are virtually free of artefacts such as seams, stereo discontinuities, vertical parallax and other mono-/stereoscopic shape distortions. Our process is robust, and other types of multiperspective panoramas, such as linear panoramas, can also benefit from our contributions. We show various comparisons and high-resolution results.</p><p>5 0.12183398 <a title="81-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Joint_3D_Scene_Reconstruction_and_Class_Segmentation.html">230 cvpr-2013-Joint 3D Scene Reconstruction and Class Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Häne, Christopher Zach, Andrea Cohen, Roland Angst, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: Both image segmentation and dense 3D modeling from images represent an intrinsically ill-posed problem. Strong regularizers are therefore required to constrain the solutions from being ’too noisy’. Unfortunately, these priors generally yield overly smooth reconstructions and/or segmentations in certain regions whereas they fail in other areas to constrain the solution sufficiently. In this paper we argue that image segmentation and dense 3D reconstruction contribute valuable information to each other’s task. As a consequence, we propose a rigorous mathematical framework to formulate and solve a joint segmentation and dense reconstruction problem. Image segmentations provide geometric cues about which surface orientations are more likely to appear at a certain location in space whereas a dense 3D reconstruction yields a suitable regularization for the segmentation problem by lifting the labeling from 2D images to 3D space. We show how appearance-based cues and 3D surface orientation priors can be learned from training data and subsequently used for class-specific regularization. Experimental results on several real data sets highlight the advantages of our joint formulation.</p><p>6 0.089922361 <a title="81-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Shape_from_Silhouette_Probability_Maps%3A_Reconstruction_of_Thin_Objects_in_the_Presence_of_Silhouette_Extraction_and_Calibration_Error.html">395 cvpr-2013-Shape from Silhouette Probability Maps: Reconstruction of Thin Objects in the Presence of Silhouette Extraction and Calibration Error</a></p>

<p>Author: Amy Tabb</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of reconstructing the shape ofthin, texture-less objects such as leafless trees when there is noise or deterministic error in the silhouette extraction step or there are small errors in camera calibration. Traditional intersection-based techniques such as the visual hull are not robust to error because they penalize false negative and false positive error unequally. We provide a voxel-based formalism that penalizes false negative and positive error equally, by casting the reconstruction problem as a pseudo-Boolean minimization problem, where voxels are the variables of a pseudo-Boolean function and are labeled occupied or empty. Since the pseudo-Boolean minimization problem is NP-Hard for nonsubmodular functions, we developed an algorithm for an approximate solution using local minimum search. Our algorithm treats input binary probability maps (in other words, silhouettes) or continuously-valued probability maps identically, and places no constraints on camera placement. The algorithm was tested on three different leafless trees and one metal object where the number of voxels is 54.4 million (voxel sides measure 3.6 mm). Results show that our . usda .gov (a)Orignalimage(b)SilhoueteProbabiltyMap approach reconstructs the complicated branching structure of thin, texture-less objects in the presence of error where intersection-based approaches currently fail. 1</p><p>3 0.64713925 <a title="81-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-FrameBreak%3A_Dramatic_Image_Extrapolation_by_Guided_Shift-Maps.html">177 cvpr-2013-FrameBreak: Dramatic Image Extrapolation by Guided Shift-Maps</a></p>

<p>Author: Julio Zaragoza, Tat-Jun Chin, Michael S. Brown, David Suter</p><p>Abstract: We investigate projective estimation under model inadequacies, i.e., when the underpinning assumptions oftheprojective model are not fully satisfied by the data. We focus on the task of image stitching which is customarily solved by estimating a projective warp — a model that is justified when the scene is planar or when the views differ purely by rotation. Such conditions are easily violated in practice, and this yields stitching results with ghosting artefacts that necessitate the usage of deghosting algorithms. To this end we propose as-projective-as-possible warps, i.e., warps that aim to be globally projective, yet allow local non-projective deviations to account for violations to the assumed imaging conditions. Based on a novel estimation technique called Moving Direct Linear Transformation (Moving DLT), our method seamlessly bridges image regions that are inconsistent with the projective model. The result is highly accurate image stitching, with significantly reduced ghosting effects, thus lowering the dependency on post hoc deghosting.</p><p>5 0.62079555 <a title="81-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Adaptive_Compressed_Tomography_Sensing.html">35 cvpr-2013-Adaptive Compressed Tomography Sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Oren Barkan, Jonathan Weill, Amir Averbuch, Shai Dekel</p><p>Abstract: One of the main challenges in Computed Tomography (CT) is how to balance between the amount of radiation the patient is exposed to during scan time and the quality of the CT image. We propose a mathematical model for adaptive CT acquisition whose goal is to reduce dosage levels while maintaining high image quality at the same time. The adaptive algorithm iterates between selective limited acquisition and improved reconstruction, with the goal of applying only the dose level required for sufficient image quality. The theoretical foundation of the algorithm is nonlinear Ridgelet approximation and a discrete form of Ridgelet analysis is used to compute the selective acquisition steps that best capture the image edges. We show experimental results where for the same number of line projections, the adaptive model produces higher image quality, when compared with standard limited angle, non-adaptive acquisition algorithms.</p><p>6 0.60165066 <a title="81-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Lost%21_Leveraging_the_Crowd_for_Probabilistic_Visual_Self-Localization.html">274 cvpr-2013-Lost!

<p>Author: Asad A. Butt, Robert T. Collins</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for global multi-target tracking that can incorporate higher-order track smoothness constraints such as constant velocity. Our problem formulation readily lends itself to path estimation in a trellis graph, but unlike previous methods, each node in our network represents a candidate pair of matching observations between consecutive frames. Extra constraints on binary flow variables in the graph result in a problem that can no longer be solved by min-cost network flow. We therefore propose an iterative solution method that relaxes these extra constraints using Lagrangian relaxation, resulting in a series of problems that ARE solvable by min-cost flow, and that progressively improve towards a high-quality solution to our original optimization problem. We present experimental results showing that our method outperforms the standard network-flow formulation as well as other recent algorithms that attempt to incorporate higher-order smoothness constraints.</p><p>2 0.85118961 <a title="81-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>3 0.85040402 <a title="81-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-SLAM%2B%2B%3A_Simultaneous_Localisation_and_Mapping_at_the_Level_of_Objects.html">372 cvpr-2013-SLAM++: Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping at the Level of Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Renato F. Salas-Moreno, Richard A. Newcombe, Hauke Strasdat, Paul H.J. Kelly, Andrew J. Davison</p><p>Abstract: We present the major advantages of a new ‘object oriented’ 3D SLAM paradigm, which takes full advantage in the loop of prior knowledge that many scenes consist of repeated, domain-specific objects and structures. As a hand-held depth camera browses a cluttered scene, realtime 3D object recognition and tracking provides 6DoF camera-object constraints which feed into an explicit graph of objects, continually refined by efficient pose-graph optimisation. This offers the descriptive and predictive power of SLAM systems which perform dense surface reconstruction, but with a huge representation compression. The object graph enables predictions for accurate ICP-based camera to model tracking at each live frame, and efficient active search for new objects in currently undescribed image regions. We demonstrate real-time incremental SLAM in large, cluttered environments, including loop closure, relocalisation and the detection of moved objects, and of course the generation of an object level scene description with the potential to enable interaction.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.84825695 <a title="81-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-City-Scale_Change_Detection_in_Cadastral_3D_Models_Using_Images.html">81 cvpr-2013-City-Scale Change Detection in Cadastral 3D Models Using Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Aparna Taneja, Luca Ballan, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to detect changes in the geometry of a city using panoramic images captured by a car driving around the city. We designed our approach to account for all the challenges involved in a large scale application of change detection, such as, inaccuracies in the input geometry, errors in the geo-location data of the images, as well as, the limited amount of information due to sparse imagery. We evaluated our approach on an area of 6 square kilometers inside a city, using 3420 images downloaded from Google StreetView. These images besides being publicly available, are also a good example of panoramic images captured with a driving vehicle, and hence demonstrating all the possible challenges resulting from such an acquisition. We also quantitatively compared the performance of our approach with respect to a ground truth, as well as to prior work. This evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the current state of the art.</p><p>5 0.84767503 <a title="81-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Detection-_and_Trajectory-Level_Exclusion_in_Multiple_Object_Tracking.html">121 cvpr-2013-Detection- and Trajectory-Level Exclusion in Multiple Object Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Anton Milan, Konrad Schindler, Stefan Roth</p><p>Abstract: When tracking multiple targets in crowded scenarios, modeling mutual exclusion between distinct targets becomes important at two levels: (1) in data association, each target observation should support at most one trajectory and each trajectory should be assigned at most one observation per frame; (2) in trajectory estimation, two trajectories should remain spatially separated at all times to avoid collisions. Yet, existing trackers often sidestep these important constraints. We address this using a mixed discrete-continuous conditional randomfield (CRF) that explicitly models both types of constraints: Exclusion between conflicting observations with supermodular pairwise terms, and exclusion between trajectories by generalizing global label costs to suppress the co-occurrence of incompatible labels (trajectories). We develop an expansion move-based MAP estimation scheme that handles both non-submodular constraints and pairwise global label costs. Furthermore, we perform a statistical analysis of ground-truth trajectories to derive appropriate CRF potentials for modeling data fidelity, target dynamics, and inter-target occlusion.</p><p>6 0.84740442 <a title="81-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Locally_Aligned_Feature_Transforms_across_Views.html">271 cvpr-2013-Locally Aligned Feature Transforms across Views</a></p>

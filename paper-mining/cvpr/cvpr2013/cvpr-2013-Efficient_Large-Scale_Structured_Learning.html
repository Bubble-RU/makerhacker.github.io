</p><p>2 In this paper, we propose two changes that allow structured SVMs to be at least as fast as their binary SVM counterparts for problems such as object detection, deformable part models, and multiclass classification. [sent-2, score-0.526]
</p><p>3 Second, we allow problem-specific knowledge to be injected into the optimization algorithm by incorporat-  ing a user-defined importance sampling function. [sent-4, score-0.113]

</p><p>5 , a set of bounding boxes in a particular image that have high training error with respect to the current detector). [sent-7, score-0.219]
</p><p>6 This change allows the method to be a superset of techniques used by conventional structured learning methods and commonly used heuristics for mapping problems into binary classification problems, with additional parameters to explore to tailor optimization to a particular application. [sent-8, score-0.324]
</p><p>7 Our main contributions are as follows: 1) We introduce SVM-IS, a fast structured SVM solver that is easy to apply to novel problems. [sent-9, score-0.354]
</p><p>8 2) We show how our solver can be used to create faster learning algorithms for cost-sensitive multiclass SVMs, object detection, and deformable part models. [sent-10, score-0.5]
</p><p>9 Background and Related Work Structured SVMs: Structured SVMs [23, 25, 24] provide a method for training a system to predict a multidimensional structured output, such as a bounding box, set of part locations, or segmentation. [sent-13, score-0.441]
</p><p>10 They minimize a convex upper  bound on a customizable loss function. [sent-14, score-0.207]
</p><p>11 Structured SVMs are a superset of SVM-based learning algorithms, which includes many of the most popular and highest performing algorithms for object detection [12, 7, 3], and multiclass classification [17, 9]. [sent-15, score-0.255]
</p><p>12 They have been applied to training object detectors using more appropriate loss functions [2], multiclass SVMs with customizable class confusion costs [5], and deformable part models [27, 4, 20]. [sent-16, score-0.489]
</p><p>13 Whereas non-linear kernel SVMs train in time that is at least quadratic in the number of training examples, solvers such as Liblinear [11] and [14] train in linear time, or in time that does not even depend on the size of the training set (at least in expectation) [21]. [sent-18, score-0.215]
</p><p>14 Among fast linear SVM solvers, online sub-gradient algorithms [21] and sequential dual algorithms [11] are faster than methods that train in batch. [sent-19, score-0.565]
</p><p>15 Fast Solvers For Large Scale Structured SVMs: The basic convex optimization methods used by the above algorithms are general to many convex optimization problems such as structured SVMs [19, 6, 25]; however, there is a comparative scarcity of publicly available fast methods for structured SVMs. [sent-20, score-0.628]
</p><p>16 Kakade and Shalev-Shwartz provided a template algorithm for developing fast optimization algorithms for novel strongly convex optimization problems and a theoretical framework for studying their statistical conver-  SVMperf  gence properties [15]. [sent-21, score-0.15]
</p><p>17 [13] recently introduced a cutting-plane-based structured SVM solver that incorporates a similar idea to our importance sampling routine. [sent-24, score-0.395]
</p><p>18 Our method is different in that it is based on extending sequential dual and sub-gradient algorithms (which are often much faster than cutting plane algorithms). [sent-25, score-0.449]

</p><p>20 For example, for deformable part models, X is an image and each yp ∈ Y defines the location of a part in the image. [sent-34, score-0.237]
</p><p>21 A structured prediction function predicts the label arg maxY s(X, Y ) with highest score: s(X, Y ) = hw, Ψ(X, Y )i (1) where s(X, Y ) is a score measuring the goodness of a particular label Y , Ψ(X, Y ) is a feature space extracted with respect to label Y (e. [sent-35, score-0.389]
</p><p>22 Let ∆(Y, Yi) be a customizable loss function associated with predicting label Y when the true label is Yi. [sent-41, score-0.245]
</p><p>23 Structured SVM learning minimizes the training error: n  Fn(w)  =Xf(w;Zi)  (2)  iX= X1  f(w;Zi) =2λkwk2+ ℓ(w,Zi)  (3)  ℓ(w, Zi) = mYax (s(Xi, Y ) + ∆(Y, Yi)) − s(Xi, Yi) (4) where each Zi = (Xi, Yi) is a training example, λ is a regularization constant. [sent-43, score-0.128]
</p><p>24 Let Y¯i be the value of Y that maximizes ℓ(w, Zi) : Y¯i  =  argmYax  (s(Xi, Y ) + ∆(Y, Yi))  (5)  Solving Eq 5 resembles a prediction problem (Eq 1) and is the primary computation for many structured learning optimization algorithms1 . [sent-45, score-0.274]
</p><p>25 The set of problems that are appropriate for structured SVMs is limited to problems and loss functions for which Eq 5 is efficiently solvable. [sent-46, score-0.322]

</p><p>27 α w 1  (6)  n  The dual objective is often useful for deriving optimization algorithms and theoretical guarantees. [sent-53, score-0.249]
</p><p>28 For example, for sliding window based object detection, vi (Y ) is a feature vector for every possible bounding box Y in image Xi. [sent-76, score-0.3]
</p><p>29 The bounding box feature vectors vi (Y ) that have non-zero weights αi (Y ) correspond to bounding boxes in the margin (e. [sent-77, score-0.401]
</p><p>30 The relationship between the dual parameters α and primal parameters w is  w(α) = −λ1nXi,Yαi(Y )vi(Y )  (9)  3. [sent-81, score-0.239]
</p><p>31 Fast algorithms for linear SVMs such as Pegasos and Liblinear can be understood as variants ofthese algorithms; whereas our algorithm has additional choices that make it more appropriate for tweaking optimization speed for a particular application. [sent-84, score-0.078]
</p><p>32 In each timestep, the algorithm solves for weights on each sample, with the objective of maximally increasing the online dual objective ∆Dt(αt) = Dt(α1 , . [sent-90, score-0.346]

</p><p>36 Note that this bound does  not depend directly on the size of the training set. [sent-108, score-0.096]
</p><p>37 The proof is based on the observation that choosing αt1 = 1increases Dt by a predictable amount (see supplementary material). [sent-109, score-0.087]

</p><p>41 Due to space limitations, we discuss two efficient algorithms for solving Eq 12 in the supplementary material. [sent-123, score-0.082]
</p><p>42 The runtime for both such algorithms is roughly equal to the time needed to compute one dot product hwt−1 , vt per sample j. [sent-124, score-0.183]
</p><p>43 The first algorithm is a general purpose one-pass approximate algo-  (Y¯tj)i  rithm, whereas the 2nd is an exact algorithm that applies to multiclass classification problems. [sent-125, score-0.13]

</p><p>46 Thus in general we should favor samples with high loss that are as uncorrelated as possible (Q is as close to a diagonal matrix as possible). [sent-135, score-0.083]
</p><p>47 Detecting Convergence: Convergence is detected based on the primal dual gap F(w) D(α) 2 is less than ǫ. [sent-136, score-0.239]
</p><p>48 Rather than explicitly compute we approximate it by the accumulated loss −  Fn(w), Pst=1f(wts−1;Zi(s)),  which exceeds jective tends to be decreasing. [sent-138, score-0.083]
</p><p>49 By the arguments presented in [22], it shares the same worst case convergence rate as Algorithm 1, typically with faster convergence when making multiple passes through the data. [sent-176, score-0.129]
</p><p>50 Comparison to Other Algorithms In this section, we briefly mention various possible optimization algorithms for structured SVMs (all of which are evaluated in our experimental results). [sent-179, score-0.317]
</p><p>51 Cutting Plane Algorithm: SVMstruct–a popular software  package for structured SVMs–optimizes Eq 2 using a cutting plane algorithm. [sent-180, score-0.333]
</p><p>52 An n-slack variety of SVMstruct solves Eq 5 for all n training examples before solving a QP problem, whereas a 1-slack variety solves a QP problem after each time Eq 5 is solved for a particular example. [sent-181, score-0.142]
</p><p>53 The n-slack method is asymptotically slower (by a factor of n) than the 1-slack method and our algorithm in terms of the number of times the inference algorithm will be invoked. [sent-182, score-0.08]
</p><p>54 SGD iterates over each example sequentially, taking an update step:  wt  ←  wt−1 − ηt∇f(wt−1; Zt)  (16)  where ∇f(wt−1 ; Zt) is the sub-gradient of Eq 3. [sent-185, score-0.256]
</p><p>55 A Pegasos-like update [21] uses a decaying step size ηt = λ1t followed by a projective step3. [sent-186, score-0.096]
</p><p>56 One can verify that SGD is equivalent to Algorithm 1 with K = 1, Y¯t1 = Y¯ , and choosing an update αt1 = 1, meeting the criteria of Theorem 3. [sent-188, score-0.144]
</p><p>57 Applications In this section, we show how Algorithm 1-2 can be applied to a variety of popular learning problems, including cost-sensitive multiclass SVMs, object detection, and deformable part models. [sent-192, score-0.282]
</p><p>58 Implement a routine to solve Eq 5: Y¯t = arg maxY (s(Xt , Y ) + ∆(Y, Yt)), which is similar to an inference problem 3. [sent-195, score-0.119]
</p><p>59 Favor samples with high loss s(Xt, Y¯tj)+∆(Y¯tj, Yt), and where hvt(Y¯ti), vt(Y¯tj)i tends to be small for i j  =  4. [sent-200, score-0.083]
</p><p>60 C is a class label, a cost-sensitive multiclass SVM solves the optimization problem:  FnC(w) = n 2λkwk2+n1iX=n1ǫi! [sent-205, score-0.204]
</p><p>61 , wC] concatenates the weights for all classes, and ∆C (c, Yi) is a confusion cost associated with predicting class c when the true label is Yi. [sent-211, score-0.113]
</p><p>62 As in [25], this problem is solvable using a structured SVM, where Ψ(X, Y ) concatenates features for each class: ΨC(X, Y )  ψc(X,Y )  =  [ψ1(X, Y ), . [sent-212, score-0.279]
</p><p>63 In the supplementary material, we derive a fast exact solver for Eq 12. [sent-219, score-0.154]
</p><p>64 The time of this update step is roughly equal to the time to evaluate one dot product hw, ΨC(X, Y )i . [sent-220, score-0.135]
</p><p>65 Sliding Window Object Detection A sliding window object detector can be trained using a structured SVM [2], where Y = {x, y, scale} encodes a bounding box and ΨB (X, Y ) is a vector of features extracted at Y . [sent-223, score-0.484]
</p><p>66 Let ∆B (Y, Yi) be an arbitrary loss function associated with predicting bounding box Y when the true bounding box is Yi. [sent-224, score-0.389]
</p><p>67 The sliding window detector can be  trained by optimizing the structured SVM objective (Eq 2). [sent-225, score-0.331]
</p><p>68 Similarly, let Mi be an array of sliding window responses, such that Mi [Y ] = hw, Ψ(Xi , Y )i, and let Li = Mi + ∆iB. [sent-227, score-0.092]
</p><p>69 Note that Y¯i  =argmYax  (hw, Ψ(Xi, Y )i + ∆(Y, Yi))  = arg mYa′x Li[Y′]  (20)  Choosing samples: We choose a sparse sample set of bounding boxes Y¯t1. [sent-228, score-0.24]
</p><p>70 This method greedily selects the bounding box with highest loss Y¯j = arg maxY Li [Y ], then suppresses all overlapping bounding boxes by setting Li [Y ] ← −∞ for all Y that overlap with Y¯j . [sent-232, score-0.436]
</p><p>71 The motivation behind this sampling technique is that overlapping bounding boxes will tend to have more correlatedfeatures, suchthat hΨ(Xt, Y¯tj), Ψ(Xt, Y¯ti)i is more likely to be high. [sent-233, score-0.2]
</p><p>72 Deformable Part Model Based Detection A Felzenszwalb-like deformable part model [12] can be trained using a structured SVM, where Y = y1, . [sent-236, score-0.359]

</p><p>74 Details of the mapping into structured SVMs are presented in [27, 4]. [sent-243, score-0.239]
</p><p>75 These methods concatenate appearance features and spatial offsets for all part-aspect pairs into a structured feature space ΨP (X, Y ). [sent-244, score-0.239]
</p><p>76 The label Y¯i can be efficiently solved for using standard dynamic programming algorithms for pictorial structure inference. [sent-245, score-0.078]
</p><p>77 Similar to the method described in the previous section, this is implemented using a modified unary detection score Lip = Mip + ∆ip for each part p, where ∆ip [yp] encodes the loss associated with placing part p at location yp. [sent-246, score-0.163]
</p><p>78 The first is the same bounding box non-maximal suppression technique described in the previous section, applied to the score for the root of the part tree after running dynamic programming. [sent-248, score-0.243]

<p>Author: Rui Yao, Qinfeng Shi, Chunhua Shen, Yanning Zhang, Anton van_den_Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Despite many advances made in the area, deformable targets and partial occlusions continue to represent key problems in visual tracking. Structured learning has shown good results when applied to tracking whole targets, but applying this approach to a part-based target model is complicated by the need to model the relationships between parts, and to avoid lengthy initialisation processes. We thus propose a method which models the unknown parts using latent variables.

<p>Author: Aurélien Lucchi, Yunpeng Li, Pascal Fua</p><p>Abstract: We propose a working set based approximate subgradient descent algorithm to minimize the margin-sensitive hinge loss arising from the soft constraints in max-margin learning frameworks, such as the structured SVM. We focus on the setting of general graphical models, such as loopy MRFs and CRFs commonly used in image segmentation, where exact inference is intractable and the most violated constraints can only be approximated, voiding the optimality guarantees of the structured SVM’s cutting plane algorithm as well as reducing the robustness of existing subgradient based methods. We show that the proposed method obtains better approximate subgradients through the use of working sets, leading to improved convergence properties and increased reliability.

<p>Author: unkown-author</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of long-term object tracking, where the object may become occluded or leave-the-view. In this setting, we show that an accurate appearance model is considerably more effective than a strong motion model. We develop simple but effective algorithms that alternate between tracking and learning a good appearance model given a track. We show that it is crucial to learn from the “right” frames, and use the formalism of self-paced curriculum learning to automatically select such frames. We leverage techniques from object detection for learning accurate appearance-based templates, demonstrating the importance of using a large negative training set (typically not used for tracking). We describe both an offline algorithm (that processes frames in batch) and a linear-time online (i.e. causal) algorithm that approaches real-time performance. Our models significantly outperform prior art, reducing the average error on benchmark videos by a factor of 4.</p><p>5 0.11620845 <a title="143-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Object_Co-detection.html">364 cvpr-2013-Robust Object Co-detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xin Guo, Dong Liu, Brendan Jou, Mojun Zhu, Anni Cai, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Object co-detection aims at simultaneous detection of objects of the same category from a pool of related images by exploiting consistent visual patterns present in candidate objects in the images. The related image set may contain a mixture of annotated objects and candidate objects generated by automatic detectors. Co-detection differs from the conventional object detection paradigm in which detection over each test image is determined one-by-one independently without taking advantage of common patterns in the data pool. In this paper, we propose a novel, robust approach to dramatically enhance co-detection by extracting a shared low-rank representation of the object instances in multiple feature spaces. The idea is analogous to that of the well-known Robust PCA [28], but has not been explored in object co-detection so far. The representation is based on a linear reconstruction over the entire data set and the low-rank approach enables effective removal of noisy and outlier samples. The extracted low-rank representation can be used to detect the target objects by spectral clustering. Extensive experiments over diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art object codetection method and the generic object detection methods without co-detection formulations.</p><p>6 0.10738676 <a title="143-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Collections_of_Part_Models_for_Object_Recognition.html">248 cvpr-2013-Learning Collections of Part Models for Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of performing inference in graphical models whose energy is a polynomial function of continuous variables. Our energy minimization method follows a dual decomposition approach, where the global problem is split into subproblems defined over the graph cliques. The optimal solution to these subproblems is obtained by making use of a polynomial system solver. Our algorithm inherits the convergence guarantees of dual decomposition. To speed up optimization, we also introduce a variant of this algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian method. Our experiments illustrate the diversity of computer vision problems that can be expressed with polynomial energies, and demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing continuous inference methods.</p><p>4 0.64521825 <a title="143-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Part-Based_Visual_Tracking_with_Online_Latent_Structural_Learning.html">324 cvpr-2013-Part-Based Visual Tracking with Online Latent Structural Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Paul Wohlhart, Martin Köstinger, Michael Donoser, Peter M. Roth, Horst Bischof</p><p>Abstract: The development of complex, powerful classifiers and their constant improvement have contributed much to the progress in many fields of computer vision. However, the trend towards large scale datasets revived the interest in simpler classifiers to reduce runtime. Simple nearest neighbor classifiers have several beneficial properties, such as low complexity and inherent multi-class handling, however, they have a runtime linear in the size of the database. Recent related work represents data samples by assigning them to a set of prototypes that partition the input feature space and afterwards applies linear classifiers on top of this representation to approximate decision boundaries locally linear. In this paper, we go a step beyond these approaches and purely focus on 1-nearest prototype classification, where we propose a novel algorithm for deriving optimal prototypes in a discriminative manner from the training samples. Our method is implicitly multi-class capable, parameter free, avoids noise overfitting and, since during testing only comparisons to the derived prototypes are required, highly efficient. Experiments demonstrate that we are able to outperform related locally linear methods, while even getting close to the results of more complex classifiers.</p><p>6 0.6230486 <a title="143-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Nonlinearly_Constrained_MRFs%3A_Exploring_the_Intrinsic_Dimensions_of_Higher-Order_Cliques.html">308 cvpr-2013-Nonlinearly Constrained MRFs: Exploring the Intrinsic Dimensions of Higher-Order Cliques</a></p>

<p>Author: Yezhou Yang, Cornelia Fermüller, Yiannis Aloimonos</p><p>Abstract: The problem of action recognition and human activity has been an active research area in Computer Vision and Robotics. While full-body motions can be characterized by movement and change of posture, no characterization, that holds invariance, has yet been proposed for the description of manipulation actions. We propose that a fundamental concept in understanding such actions, are the consequences of actions. There is a small set of fundamental primitive action consequences that provides a systematic high-level classification of manipulation actions. In this paper a technique is developed to recognize these action consequences. At the heart of the technique lies a novel active tracking and segmentation method that monitors the changes in appearance and topological structure of the manipulated object. These are then used in a visual semantic graph (VSG) based procedure applied to the time sequence of the monitored object to recognize the action consequence. We provide a new dataset, called Manipulation Action Consequences (MAC 1.0), which can serve as testbed for other studies on this topic. Several ex- periments on this dataset demonstrates that our method can robustly track objects and detect their deformations and division during the manipulation. Quantitative tests prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.</p><p>3 0.86351597 <a title="143-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Weakly-Supervised_Dual_Clustering_for_Image_Semantic_Segmentation.html">460 cvpr-2013-Weakly-Supervised Dual Clustering for Image Semantic Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Liu, Jing Liu, Zechao Li, Jinhui Tang, Hanqing Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Weakly-Supervised Dual Clustering (WSDC) approach for image semantic segmentation with image-level labels, i.e., collaboratively performing image segmentation and tag alignment with those regions. The proposed approach is motivated from the observation that superpixels belonging to an object class usually exist across multiple images and hence can be gathered via the idea of clustering. In WSDC, spectral clustering is adopted to cluster the superpixels obtained from a set of over-segmented images. At the same time, a linear transformation between features and labels as a kind of discriminative clustering is learned to select the discriminative features among different classes. The both clustering outputs should be consistent as much as possible. Besides, weakly-supervised constraints from image-level labels are imposed to restrict the labeling of superpixels. Finally, the non-convex and non-smooth objective function are efficiently optimized using an iterative CCCP procedure. Extensive experiments conducted on MSRC andLabelMe datasets demonstrate the encouraging performance of our method in comparison with some state-of-the-arts.</p><p>4 0.86237943 <a title="143-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Globally_Consistent_Multi-label_Assignment_on_the_Ray_Space_of_4D_Light_Fields.html">188 cvpr-2013-Globally Consistent Multi-label Assignment on the Ray Space of 4D Light Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Sven Wanner, Christoph Straehle, Bastian Goldluecke</p><p>Abstract: Wepresent thefirst variationalframeworkfor multi-label segmentation on the ray space of 4D light fields. For traditional segmentation of single images, , features need to be extractedfrom the 2Dprojection ofa three-dimensional scene. The associated loss of geometry information can cause severe problems, for example if different objects have a very similar visual appearance. In this work, we show that using a light field instead of an image not only enables to train classifiers which can overcome many of these problems, but also provides an optimal data structure for label optimization by implicitly providing scene geometry information. It is thus possible to consistently optimize label assignment over all views simultaneously. As a further contribution, we make all light fields available online with complete depth and segmentation ground truth data where available, and thus establish the first benchmark data set for light field analysis to facilitate competitive further development of algorithms.</p><p>5 0.86074102 <a title="143-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Uncalibrated_Photometric_Stereo_for_Unknown_Isotropic_Reflectances.html">443 cvpr-2013-Uncalibrated Photometric Stereo for Unknown Isotropic Reflectances</a></p>
<p>Author: Feng Lu, Yasuyuki Matsushita, Imari Sato, Takahiro Okabe, Yoichi Sato</p><p>Abstract: We propose an uncalibrated photometric stereo method that works with general and unknown isotropic reflectances. Our method uses a pixel intensity profile, which is a sequence of radiance intensities recorded at a pixel across multi-illuminance images. We show that for general isotropic materials, the geodesic distance between intensity profiles is linearly related to the angular difference of their surface normals, and that the intensity distribution of an intensity profile conveys information about the reflectance properties, when the intensity profile is obtained under uniformly distributed directional lightings. Based on these observations, we show that surface normals can be estimated up to a convex/concave ambiguity. A solution method based on matrix decomposition with missing data is developed for a reliable estimation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of our method are performed using both synthetic and real-world scenes.</p><p>6 0.85533166 <a title="143-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Collections_of_Part_Models_for_Object_Recognition.html">248 cvpr-2013-Learning Collections of Part Models for Object Recognition</a></p>

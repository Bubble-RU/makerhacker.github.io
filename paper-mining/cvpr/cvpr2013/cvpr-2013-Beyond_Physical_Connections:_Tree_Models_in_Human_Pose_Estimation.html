</p><p>7 We surprisingly find that no latent variables are introduced in the Leeds Sport Dataset (LSP) during learning latent trees for deformable model, which aims at approximating the joint distributions of body part locations using minimal tree structure. [sent-13, score-1.28]
</p><p>8 This suggests one can straightforwardly use a mixed representation of single and combined parts to approximate their joint distribution in a simple tree model. [sent-14, score-0.99]
</p><p>9 As such, one only needs to build Visual Categories of the combined parts, and then perform inference on the learned latent tree. [sent-15, score-0.565]
</p><p>10 Introduction Tree models are very efficient in a number of computer vision tasks such as human pose estimation and other articulated body modeling. [sent-19, score-0.599]
</p><p>11 Also because of these unique advantages, it is not uncommon to speculate that tree models may not effectively handle computer vision problems in real world applications. [sent-21, score-0.445]
</p><p>12 As a consequence, latent variables [1] and loopy graphical models [2] were proposed in the past few years for human pose estimation as the remedy of the problems caused by those “oversimplified” tree models. [sent-22, score-1.144]
</p><p>13 Particularly, it is believed that loopy graphical models are necessary when combined parts (or “poselet”) are used to handle large variance in appearance. [sent-24, score-0.702]
</p><p>14 In this paper, we argue that the simple tree model is still a very powerful representation, and combined parts and single parts can be used together without sacrificing the bene-  fits brought by exact inference. [sent-26, score-1.137]
</p><p>15 All the questions about tree models arise when we start to use the skeleton as the tree structure. [sent-28, score-0.841]
</p><p>16 Further, this limits our choices of representation, as well as complicates the graphical model when combined parts are introduced. [sent-30, score-0.568]
</p><p>17 Our goal is to learn a tree model directly from observed variables. [sent-31, score-0.342]
</p><p>18 These observations can be body part locations, as used in many recent pose estimation papers. [sent-32, score-0.378]
</p><p>19 At the same time, this allows us to introduce more variables such as combined parts, as long as they can be observed and the state space is the same as that of single body parts. [sent-33, score-0.447]
</p><p>20 Recent advancements in learning graphical models enable us to learn latent trees from these observations. [sent-35, score-0.424]
</p><p>21 The latent tree models suggest that we could approximate the joint distribution of the observations by a tree model, and latent variables are introduced only when necessary. [sent-36, score-1.382]
</p><p>22 We start our journey by exploring the property of the latent tree models. [sent-37, score-0.603]
</p><p>23 It is not surprising that the resulting latent tree has a similar structure to human skeleton. [sent-38, score-0.735]
</p><p>24 This human pose estimation dataset is challenging both in the pose variations and its size. [sent-40, score-0.552]
</p><p>25 Therefore, this implies we can directly use a tree model with mixed types of variables for human pose estimation to approximate the true distribution. [sent-41, score-0.794]
</p><p>26 The types for single parts a) and b) are defined by their relative positions to their neighbors. [sent-44, score-0.337]
</p><p>27 For combined parts c)-e), the types are defined by their visual categories. [sent-45, score-0.569]
</p><p>28 Unlike other state of the arts in human pose estimation that use only a small number of categories, we find that a larger number of visual categories facilitates pose estimation. [sent-56, score-0.672]
</p><p>29 The inference of our model is very efficient due to the tree structure, and results suggest that our method outperforms state of the art on the LSP dataset. [sent-58, score-0.511]
</p><p>30 Our contributions include: •  •  •  We propose to learn tree models for articulated pose eWsteim parotipoons problems. [sent-62, score-0.696]

</p><p>33 Related work Human pose estimation Human pose estimation has been formulated as a part based inference problem. [sent-66, score-0.573]
</p><p>34 Appearance model and deformable model that describe relations between parts were proposed in the past decade. [sent-67, score-0.336]
</p><p>35 [9] proposed the idea of poselets as the building blocks for human recognition, which refers to combined parts that are distinctive in training images. [sent-71, score-0.619]
</p><p>36 [4] proposed a flexible mixtures-of-parts model for articulated pose estimation. [sent-76, score-0.308]
</p><p>37 Instead of modeling both location and orientation of each body part as rigid part, they used the model that only contains non-oriented parts with co-occurrence constraints. [sent-77, score-0.404]
</p><p>38 It is widely hypothesized that graphical models that go beyond pairwise links lead to better performance in pose estimation. [sent-78, score-0.299]
</p><p>39 Several new approaches also use latent nodes [1] or hierarchical graph models [10]. [sent-80, score-0.358]
</p><p>40 In this paper, we examine the above concepts, and suggest that these important components in articulated body detection and pose estimation can be integrated in an efficient framework. [sent-81, score-0.499]
</p><p>41 Therefore, we exploit a newly developed technique in learning latent tree models. [sent-82, score-0.603]
</p><p>42 Latent tree models The latent tree models [11] aim at finding tree approximations of joint distribution of observable variables. [sent-83, score-1.429]
</p><p>43 In Chow-Liu tree [12] all nodes in the latent tree must be observable. [sent-85, score-0.996]
</p><p>44 Their methods automatically build tree structures from ob-  servations, using information distances as the guideline of merging nodes and introducing latent variables. [sent-88, score-0.738]
</p><p>45 This theoretical approach is very useful for human pose estimation, because we can learn a structure directly from our observations without making many assumptions of the physical constraints, while the performance is still guaranteed in terms of approximating the joint distribution.

</p><p>47 Latent tree models for pose estimation First, we provide a brief introduction to the latent tree models, and show the results on modeling the body joints in the LSP using latent tree models. [sent-95, score-2.01]
</p><p>48 We then present the learning of visual category for combined parts, which is  necessary in our model for reducing complexity. [sent-96, score-0.322]
</p><p>49 Brief introduction to latent tree models The goal of latent tree model is to recover a treestructured graphical model that best approximates the distributions of a set of observations. [sent-100, score-1.358]
</p><p>50 Recursive Grouping and CLGrouping were proposed in [11] to create latent tree models without any redundant hidden nodes. [sent-101, score-0.649]
</p><p>51 CLGrouping is its extension that can build up latent tree structures for large diameter graphs more efficiently with a pre-processing step. [sent-105, score-0.634]
</p><p>52 In this grouping method, the latent tree were built recursively by identifying sibling groups using information distances. [sent-106, score-0.674]
</p><p>53 ance is defined as dij = −log(ρij)  (2)  Then, the recursive grouping method build up the latent tree by testing relationships among each triplet i,j,k ∈ V . [sent-109, score-0.806]
</p><p>54 ≤  ≤  In this way, a latent tree is recursively built. [sent-116, score-0.633]
</p><p>55 Latent trees for human pose Our goals is to use single parts and combined parts in the inference model. [sent-120, score-1.158]
</p><p>56 Given image I, we define P parts as pi = (loci , ti) , i ∈ [1, . [sent-121, score-0.303]

</p><p>59 Two possible part combinations in our case are: •  •  Connected parts: A combined part may have physical cCoonnnnecectitoend i pna hrutsm:a An body. [sent-129, score-0.359]

</p><p>61 Therefore, one may combine these two physically separated parts as one element. [sent-136, score-0.3]
</p><p>62 In our following experiment, we defined 14 single parts and 10 combined parts (Fig. [sent-137, score-0.795]
</p><p>63 We tested two scenarios in our experiment: •  •  Single parts only: In this experiment, we used only single parts sfo orn tlyhe: Ilante tnhit str eexep meriomdeelns. [sent-141, score-0.567]
</p><p>64 s2e dsh oonwlys two results using CLGrouping tree and CL-Neighbor Joining [11]. [sent-143, score-0.342]
</p><p>65 It is not very surprising that the structure is similar to human body, but please note that there is no latent node introduced by CLGrouping method in such a complicated and challenging dataset. [sent-144, score-0.422]
</p><p>66 Because no redundant latent nodes is used in latent tree model, this means the joint distributions of all body joints can be approximated by a simple tree structure. [sent-145, score-1.515]
</p><p>67 Therefore, introducing combined parts is a solution in many algorithms. [sent-147, score-0.496]
</p><p>68 We used both single and combined parts in the latent tree models (Fig. [sent-148, score-1.176]
</p><p>69 This means we can approxi-  mate the joint distribution by combined parts and single parts in a tree structure. [sent-151, score-1.187]
</p><p>70 This finding makes our latent tree model different from [1], because all our nodes are observable. [sent-155, score-0.654]
</p><p>71 Learning visual categories of combined parts Combined parts are more discriminative than single parts. [sent-159, score-0.898]
</p><p>72 We learned visual categories of each combined part directly from image space. [sent-163, score-0.375]
</p><p>73 For each part, we build a latent SVM ([14]) model for learning visual categories. [sent-172, score-0.327]
</p><p>74 Given N instances of a combined part, we learn K categories of this part, and generate the label set T = t1, t2 , · · · , tN, ti ∈ [1, K] . [sent-175, score-0.326]
</p><p>75 The visual categories of combined parts characterize the appearance models in a way that they can be regarded as “templates”. [sent-183, score-0.685]
</p><p>76 We show the results of HOG filters for different parts as well as different visual categories for two parts in Fig. [sent-185, score-0.675]
</p><p>77 Our model Given a training set, we manually define the parts of interest, and learn a latent tree model for these parts. [sent-189, score-0.902]
</p><p>78 The following notations are consistent with those in [4], while our types for combined parts have different meanings. [sent-190, score-0.534]

</p><p>81 Our combined parts are defined as the limbs in [15]. [sent-231, score-0.533]

</p><p>84 Side by side comparison of [4] (left) and our pose estimation results (right) in the Leeds Sport dataset (LSP). [sent-241, score-0.279]
</p><p>85 Experiment setting We used 8-15 visual categories for combined parts. [sent-252, score-0.331]
</p><p>86 This is possibly because we effectively exploit the connections between single and combined parts, as well as the benefit from exact inference. [sent-296, score-0.297]
</p><p>87 One may speculate that our combined parts may be overfitted to a dataset, because they captures the distinctive features as HOG templates during visual category learning. [sent-300, score-0.647]
</p><p>88 We trained our model on all the 305 images in the  PARSE dataset [6], and then used the models to estimate human pose on the LSP dataset. [sent-302, score-0.356]
</p><p>89 Experiment setting In this experiment we used 3 combined parts, “head”, “left leg”, and “right leg”. [sent-331, score-0.287]
</p><p>90 We used 6 visual categories for each combined part. [sent-332, score-0.331]

<p>Author: Leonid Pishchulin, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Peter Gehler, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the challenging problem of articulated human pose estimation in still images. We observe that despite high variability of the body articulations, human motions and activities often simultaneously constrain the positions of multiple body parts. Modelling such higher order part dependencies seemingly comes at a cost of more expensive inference, which resulted in their limited use in state-of-the-art methods. In this paper we propose a model that incorporates higher order part dependencies while remaining efficient. We achieve this by defining a conditional model in which all body parts are connected a-priori, but which becomes a tractable tree-structured pictorial structures model once the image observations are available. In order to derive a set of conditioning variables we rely on the poselet-based features that have been shown to be effective for people detection but have so far found limited application for articulated human pose estimation. We demon- strate the effectiveness of our approach on three publicly available pose estimation benchmarks improving or being on-par with state of the art in each case.</p><p>3 0.28669289 <a title="60-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors.html">206 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using Body Parts Dependent Joint Regressors</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Dantone, Juergen Gall, Christian Leistner, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of estimating 2d human pose from still images. Recent methods that rely on discriminatively trained deformable parts organized in a tree model have shown to be very successful in solving this task. Within such a pictorial structure framework, we address the problem of obtaining good part templates by proposing novel, non-linear joint regressors. In particular, we employ two-layered random forests as joint regressors. The first layer acts as a discriminative, independent body part classifier. The second layer takes the estimated class distributions of the first one into account and is thereby able to predict joint locations by modeling the interdependence and co-occurrence of the parts. This results in a pose estimation framework that takes dependencies between body parts already for joint localization into account and is thus able to circumvent typical ambiguities of tree structures, such as for legs and arms. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our body parts dependent joint regressors achieve a higher joint localization accuracy than tree-based state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.24802776 <a title="60-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Joint_Model_for_2D_and_3D_Pose_Estimation_from_a_Single_Image.html">14 cvpr-2013-A Joint Model for 2D and 3D Pose Estimation from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Edgar Simo-Serra, Ariadna Quattoni, Carme Torras, Francesc Moreno-Noguer</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to automatically recover 3D human pose from a single image. Most previous work follows a pipelined approach: initially, a set of 2D features such as edges, joints or silhouettes are detected in the image, and then these observations are used to infer the 3D pose. Solving these two problems separately may lead to erroneous 3D poses when the feature detector has performed poorly. In this paper, we address this issue by jointly solving both the 2D detection and the 3D inference problems. For this purpose, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates a generative model based on latent variables and discriminative 2D part detectors based on HOGs, and perform inference using evolutionary algorithms. Real experimentation demonstrates competitive results, and the ability of our methodology to provide accurate 2D and 3D pose estimations even when the 2D detectors are inaccurate.</p><p>5 0.21145597 <a title="60-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_Pose_Estimation_Using_Discriminative_Armlet_Classifiers.html">45 cvpr-2013-Articulated Pose Estimation Using Discriminative Armlet Classifiers</a></p>

<p>Author: Fang Wang, Yi Li</p><p>Abstract: Simple tree models for articulated objects prevails in the last decade. However, it is also believed that these simple tree models are not capable of capturing large variations in many scenarios, such as human pose estimation. This paper attempts to address three questions: 1) are simple tree models sufficient? more specifically, 2) how to use tree models effectively in human pose estimation? and 3) how shall we use combined parts together with single parts efficiently? Assuming we have a set of single parts and combined parts, and the goal is to estimate a joint distribution of their locations. We surprisingly find that no latent variables are introduced in the Leeds Sport Dataset (LSP) during learning latent trees for deformable model, which aims at approximating the joint distributions of body part locations using minimal tree structure. This suggests one can straightforwardly use a mixed representation of single and combined parts to approximate their joint distribution in a simple tree model. As such, one only needs to build Visual Categories of the combined parts, and then perform inference on the learned latent tree. Our method outperformed the state of the art on the LSP, both in the scenarios when the training images are from the same dataset and from the PARSE dataset. Experiments on animal images from the VOC challenge further support our findings.</p><p>2 0.92560059 <a title="60-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors.html">206 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using Body Parts Dependent Joint Regressors</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Dantone, Juergen Gall, Christian Leistner, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of estimating 2d human pose from still images. Recent methods that rely on discriminatively trained deformable parts organized in a tree model have shown to be very successful in solving this task. Within such a pictorial structure framework, we address the problem of obtaining good part templates by proposing novel, non-linear joint regressors. In particular, we employ two-layered random forests as joint regressors. The first layer acts as a discriminative, independent body part classifier. The second layer takes the estimated class distributions of the first one into account and is thereby able to predict joint locations by modeling the interdependence and co-occurrence of the parts. This results in a pose estimation framework that takes dependencies between body parts already for joint localization into account and is thus able to circumvent typical ambiguities of tree structures, such as for legs and arms. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our body parts dependent joint regressors achieve a higher joint localization accuracy than tree-based state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>3 0.90170926 <a title="60-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Poselet_Conditioned_Pictorial_Structures.html">335 cvpr-2013-Poselet Conditioned Pictorial Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Leonid Pishchulin, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Peter Gehler, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the challenging problem of articulated human pose estimation in still images. We observe that despite high variability of the body articulations, human motions and activities often simultaneously constrain the positions of multiple body parts. Modelling such higher order part dependencies seemingly comes at a cost of more expensive inference, which resulted in their limited use in state-of-the-art methods. In this paper we propose a model that incorporates higher order part dependencies while remaining efficient. We achieve this by defining a conditional model in which all body parts are connected a-priori, but which becomes a tractable tree-structured pictorial structures model once the image observations are available. In order to derive a set of conditioning variables we rely on the poselet-based features that have been shown to be effective for people detection but have so far found limited application for articulated human pose estimation. We demon- strate the effectiveness of our approach on three publicly available pose estimation benchmarks improving or being on-par with state of the art in each case.</p><p>4 0.86279064 <a title="60-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-3D_Pictorial_Structures_for_Multiple_View_Articulated_Pose_Estimation.html">2 cvpr-2013-3D Pictorial Structures for Multiple View Articulated Pose Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Wen-Sheng Chu, Fernando De La Torre, Jeffery F. Cohn</p><p>Abstract: Automatic facial action unit (AFA) detection from video is a long-standing problem in facial expression analysis. Most approaches emphasize choices of features and classifiers. They neglect individual differences in target persons. People vary markedly in facial morphology (e.g., heavy versus delicate brows, smooth versus deeply etched wrinkles) and behavior. Individual differences can dramatically influence how well generic classifiers generalize to previously unseen persons. While a possible solution would be to train person-specific classifiers, that often is neither feasible nor theoretically compelling. The alternative that we propose is to personalize a generic classifier in an unsupervised manner (no additional labels for the test subjects are required). We introduce a transductive learning method, which we refer to Selective Transfer Machine (STM), to personalize a generic classifier by attenuating person-specific biases. STM achieves this effect by simultaneously learning a classifier and re-weighting the training samples that are most relevant to the test subject. To evaluate the effectiveness of STM, we compared STM to generic classifiers and to cross-domain learning methods in three major databases: CK+ [20], GEMEP-FERA [32] and RU-FACS [2]. STM outperformed generic classifiers in all.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.90673149 <a title="60-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Beyond_Physical_Connections%3A_Tree_Models_in_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">60 cvpr-2013-Beyond Physical Connections: Tree Models in Human Pose Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Luming Zhang, Mingli Song, Zicheng Liu, Xiao Liu, Jiajun Bu, Chun Chen</p><p>Abstract: Weakly supervised image segmentation is a challenging problem in computer vision field. In this paper, we present a new weakly supervised image segmentation algorithm by learning the distribution of spatially structured superpixel sets from image-level labels. Specifically, we first extract graphlets from each image where a graphlet is a smallsized graph consisting of superpixels as its nodes and it encapsulates the spatial structure of those superpixels. Then, a manifold embedding algorithm is proposed to transform graphlets of different sizes into equal-length feature vectors. Thereafter, we use GMM to learn the distribution of the post-embedding graphlets. Finally, we propose a novel image segmentation algorithm, called graphlet cut, that leverages the learned graphlet distribution in measuring the homogeneity of a set of spatially structured superpixels. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised image segmentation methods, and its performance is comparable to those of the fully supervised segmentation models.</p><p>5 0.89252758 <a title="60-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_Pose_Estimation_Using_Discriminative_Armlet_Classifiers.html">45 cvpr-2013-Articulated Pose Estimation Using Discriminative Armlet Classifiers</a></p>

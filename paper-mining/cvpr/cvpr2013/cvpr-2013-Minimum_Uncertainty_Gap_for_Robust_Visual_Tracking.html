<p>Author: Rui Yao, Qinfeng Shi, Chunhua Shen, Yanning Zhang, Anton van_den_Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Despite many advances made in the area, deformable targets and partial occlusions continue to represent key problems in visual tracking. Structured learning has shown good results when applied to tracking whole targets, but applying this approach to a part-based target model is complicated by the need to model the relationships between parts, and to avoid lengthy initialisation processes. We thus propose a method which models the unknown parts using latent variables. In doing so we extend the online algorithm pegasos to the structured prediction case (i.e., predicting the location of the bounding boxes) with latent part variables. To better estimate the parts, and to avoid over-fitting caused by the extra model complexity/capacity introduced by theparts, wepropose a two-stage trainingprocess, based on the primal rather than the dual form. We then show that the method outperforms the state-of-the-art (linear and non-linear kernel) trackers.</p><p>3 0.33620524 <a title="285-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Online_Object_Tracking%3A_A_Benchmark.html">314 cvpr-2013-Online Object Tracking: A Benchmark</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Wu, Jongwoo Lim, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Object tracking is one of the most important components in numerous applications of computer vision. While much progress has been made in recent years with efforts on sharing code and datasets, it is of great importance to develop a library and benchmark to gauge the state of the art. After briefly reviewing recent advances of online object tracking, we carry out large scale experiments with various evaluation criteria to understand how these algorithms perform. The test image sequences are annotated with different attributes for performance evaluation and analysis. By analyzing quantitative results, we identify effective approaches for robust tracking and provide potential future research directions in this field.</p><p>4 0.30113837 <a title="285-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Visual_Tracking_via_Locality_Sensitive_Histograms.html">457 cvpr-2013-Visual Tracking via Locality Sensitive Histograms</a></p>
<p>Author: Shengfeng He, Qingxiong Yang, Rynson W.H. Lau, Jiang Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel locality sensitive histogram algorithm for visual tracking. Unlike the conventional image histogram that counts the frequency of occurrences of each intensity value by adding ones to the corresponding bin, a locality sensitive histogram is computed at each pixel location and a floating-point value is added to the corresponding bin for each occurrence of an intensity value. The floating-point value declines exponentially with respect to the distance to the pixel location where the histogram is computed; thus every pixel is considered but those that are far away can be neglected due to the very small weights assigned. An efficient algorithm is proposed that enables the locality sensitive histograms to be computed in time linear in the image size and the number of bins. A robust tracking framework based on the locality sensitive histograms is proposed, which consists of two main components: a new feature for tracking that is robust to illumination changes and a novel multi-region tracking algorithm that runs in realtime even with hundreds of regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed tracking framework outper- , forms the state-of-the-art methods in challenging scenarios, especially when the illumination changes dramatically.</p><p>5 0.28574261 <a title="285-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Structure_Preserving_Object_Tracking.html">414 cvpr-2013-Structure Preserving Object Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Lu Zhang, Laurens van_der_Maaten</p><p>Abstract: Model-free trackers can track arbitrary objects based on a single (bounding-box) annotation of the object. Whilst the performance of model-free trackers has recently improved significantly, simultaneously tracking multiple objects with similar appearance remains very hard. In this paper, we propose a new multi-object model-free tracker (based on tracking-by-detection) that resolves this problem by incorporating spatial constraints between the objects. The spatial constraints are learned along with the object detectors using an online structured SVM algorithm. The experimental evaluation ofour structure-preserving object tracker (SPOT) reveals significant performance improvements in multi-object tracking. We also show that SPOT can improve the performance of single-object trackers by simultaneously tracking different parts of the object.</p><p>6 0.26302826 <a title="285-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Self-Paced_Learning_for_Long-Term_Tracking.html">386 cvpr-2013-Self-Paced Learning for Long-Term Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Dong Wang, Huchuan Lu, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generative tracking method based on a novel robust linear regression algorithm. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed Least Soft-thresold Squares (LSS) algorithm models the error term with the Gaussian-Laplacian distribution, which can be solved efficiently. Based on maximum joint likelihood of parameters, we derive a LSS distance to measure the difference between an observation sample and the dictionary. Compared with the distance derived from ordinary least squares methods, the proposed metric is more effective in dealing with outliers. In addition, we present an update scheme to capture the appearance change of the tracked target and ensure that the model is properly updated. Experimental results on several challenging image sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracker achieves more favorable performance than the state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.80760437 <a title="285-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Structure_Preserving_Object_Tracking.html">414 cvpr-2013-Structure Preserving Object Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Victor Fragoso, Matthew Turk</p><p>Abstract: We present SWIGS, a Swift and efficient Guided Sampling method for robust model estimation from image feature correspondences. Our method leverages the accuracy of our new confidence measure (MR-Rayleigh), which assigns a correctness-confidence to a putative correspondence in an online fashion. MR-Rayleigh is inspired by Meta-Recognition (MR), an algorithm that aims to predict when a classifier’s outcome is correct. We demonstrate that by using a Rayleigh distribution, the prediction accuracy of MR can be improved considerably. Our experiments show that MR-Rayleigh tends to predict better than the often-used Lowe ’s ratio, Brown’s ratio, and the standard MR under a range of imaging conditions. Furthermore, our homography estimation experiment demonstrates that SWIGS performs similarly or better than other guided sampling methods while requiring fewer iterations, leading to fast and accurate model estimates.</p><p>3 0.77989388 <a title="285-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Practical_Rank-Constrained_Eight-Point_Algorithm_for_Fundamental_Matrix_Estimation.html">23 cvpr-2013-A Practical Rank-Constrained Eight-Point Algorithm for Fundamental Matrix Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yinqiang Zheng, Shigeki Sugimoto, Masatoshi Okutomi</p><p>Abstract: Due to its simplicity, the eight-point algorithm has been widely used in fundamental matrix estimation. Unfortunately, the rank-2 constraint of a fundamental matrix is enforced via a posterior rank correction step, thus leading to non-optimal solutions to the original problem. To address this drawback, existing algorithms need to solve either a very high order polynomial or a sequence of convex relaxation problems, both of which are computationally ineffective and numerically unstable. In this work, we present a new rank-2 constrained eight-point algorithm, which directly incorporates the rank-2 constraint in the minimization process. To avoid singularities, we propose to solve seven subproblems and retrieve their globally optimal solutions by using tailored polynomial system solvers. Our proposed method is noniterative, computationally efficient and numerically stable. Experiment results have verified its superiority over existing algebraic error based algorithms in terms of accuracy, as well as its advantages when used to initialize geometric error based algorithms.</p><p>4 0.76593393 <a title="285-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Continuous_Inference_in_Graphical_Models_with_Polynomial_Energies.html">95 cvpr-2013-Continuous Inference in Graphical Models with Polynomial Energies</a></p>
<p>Author: Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of performing inference in graphical models whose energy is a polynomial function of continuous variables. Our energy minimization method follows a dual decomposition approach, where the global problem is split into subproblems defined over the graph cliques. The optimal solution to these subproblems is obtained by making use of a polynomial system solver. Our algorithm inherits the convergence guarantees of dual decomposition. To speed up optimization, we also introduce a variant of this algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian method. Our experiments illustrate the diversity of computer vision problems that can be expressed with polynomial energies, and demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing continuous inference methods.</p><p>5 0.76519561 <a title="285-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Principled_Deep_Random_Field_Model_for_Image_Segmentation.html">24 cvpr-2013-A Principled Deep Random Field Model for Image Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Pushmeet Kohli, Anton Osokin, Stefanie Jegelka</p><p>Abstract: We discuss a model for image segmentation that is able to overcome the short-boundary bias observed in standard pairwise random field based approaches. To wit, we show that a random field with multi-layered hidden units can encode boundary preserving higher order potentials such as the ones used in the cooperative cuts model of [11] while still allowing for fast and exact MAP inference. Exact inference allows our model to outperform previous image segmentation methods, and to see the true effect of coupling graph edges. Finally, our model can be easily extended to handle segmentation instances with multiple labels, for which it yields promising results.</p><p>6 0.75832939 <a title="285-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Deformable_Graph_Matching.html">106 cvpr-2013-Deformable Graph Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Yue Wu, Zuoguan Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: Facial feature tracking is an active area in computer vision due to its relevance to many applications. It is a nontrivial task, sincefaces may have varyingfacial expressions, poses or occlusions. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a face shape prior model that is constructed based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and their variants. Specifically, we first construct a model based on Deep Belief Networks to capture the face shape variations due to varying facial expressions for near-frontal view. To handle pose variations, the frontal face shape prior model is incorporated into a 3-way RBM model that could capture the relationship between frontal face shapes and non-frontal face shapes. Finally, we introduce methods to systematically combine the face shape prior models with image measurements of facial feature points. Experiments on benchmark databases show that with the proposed method, facial feature points can be tracked robustly and accurately even if faces have significant facial expressions and poses.</p><p>3 0.24612834 <a title="77-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_and_Aligning_Faces_by_Image_Retrieval.html">119 cvpr-2013-Detecting and Aligning Faces by Image Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohui Shen, Zhe Lin, Jonathan Brandt, Ying Wu</p><p>Abstract: Detecting faces in uncontrolled environments continues to be a challenge to traditional face detection methods[24] due to the large variation in facial appearances, as well as occlusion and clutter. In order to overcome these challenges, we present a novel and robust exemplarbased face detector that integrates image retrieval and discriminative learning. A large database of faces with bounding rectangles and facial landmark locations is collected, and simple discriminative classifiers are learned from each of them. A voting-based method is then proposed to let these classifiers cast votes on the test image through an efficient image retrieval technique. As a result, faces can be very efficiently detected by selecting the modes from the voting maps, without resorting to exhaustive sliding window-style scanning. Moreover, due to the exemplar-based framework, our approach can detect faces under challenging conditions without explicitly modeling their variations. Evaluation on two public benchmark datasets shows that our new face detection approach is accurate and efficient, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. We further propose to use image retrieval for face validation (in order to remove false positives) and for face alignment/landmark localization. The same methodology can also be easily generalized to other facerelated tasks, such as attribute recognition, as well as general object detection.</p><p>4 0.22929174 <a title="77-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Constrained_Clustering_and_Its_Application_to_Face_Clustering_in_Videos.html">92 cvpr-2013-Constrained Clustering and Its Application to Face Clustering in Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Baoyuan Wu, Yifan Zhang, Bao-Gang Hu, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on face clustering in videos. Given the detected faces from real-world videos, we partition all faces into K disjoint clusters. Different from clustering on a collection of facial images, the faces from videos are organized as face tracks and the frame index of each face is also provided. As a result, many pairwise constraints between faces can be easily obtained from the temporal and spatial knowledge of the face tracks. These constraints can be effectively incorporated into a generative clustering model based on the Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRFs). Within the HMRF model, the pairwise constraints are augmented by label-level and constraint-level local smoothness to guide the clustering process. The parameters for both the unary and the pairwise potential functions are learned by the simulated field algorithm, and the weights of constraints can be easily adjusted. We further introduce an efficient clustering framework specially for face clustering in videos, considering that faces in adjacent frames of the same face track are very similar. The framework is applicable to other clustering algorithms to significantly reduce the computational cost. Experiments on two face data sets from real-world videos demonstrate the significantly improved performance of our algorithm over state-of-theart algorithms.</p><p>5 0.20288156 <a title="77-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Elastic_Matching_for_Pose_Variant_Face_Verification.html">338 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Elastic Matching for Pose Variant Face Verification</a></p>
<p>Author: Haoxiang Li, Gang Hua, Zhe Lin, Jonathan Brandt, Jianchao Yang</p><p>Abstract: Pose variation remains to be a major challenge for realworld face recognition. We approach this problem through a probabilistic elastic matching method. We take a part based representation by extracting local features (e.g., LBP or SIFT) from densely sampled multi-scale image patches. By augmenting each feature with its location, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is trained to capture the spatialappearance distribution of all face images in the training corpus. Each mixture component of the GMM is confined to be a spherical Gaussian to balance the influence of the appearance and the location terms. Each Gaussian component builds correspondence of a pair of features to be matched between two faces/face tracks. For face verification, we train an SVM on the vector concatenating the difference vectors of all the feature pairs to decide if a pair of faces/face tracks is matched or not. We further propose a joint Bayesian adaptation algorithm to adapt the universally trained GMM to better model the pose variations between the target pair of faces/face tracks, which consistently improves face verification accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art in the most restricted protocol on Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW) and the YouTube video face database by a significant margin.</p><p>6 0.19299299 <a title="77-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Face_Recognition_in_Movie_Trailers_via_Mean_Sequence_Sparse_Representation-Based_Classification.html">160 cvpr-2013-Face Recognition in Movie Trailers via Mean Sequence Sparse Representation-Based Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhen Cui, Wen Li, Dong Xu, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p><p>Abstract: In many real-world face recognition scenarios, face images can hardly be aligned accurately due to complex appearance variations or low-quality images. To address this issue, we propose a new approach to extract robust face region descriptors. Specifically, we divide each image (resp. video) into several spatial blocks (resp. spatial-temporal volumes) and then represent each block (resp. volume) by sum-pooling the nonnegative sparse codes of position-free patches sampled within the block (resp. volume). Whitened Principal Component Analysis (WPCA) is further utilized to reduce the feature dimension, which leads to our Spatial Face Region Descriptor (SFRD) (resp. Spatial-Temporal Face Region Descriptor, STFRD) for images (resp. videos). Moreover, we develop a new distance method for face verification metric learning called Pairwise-constrained Multiple Metric Learning (PMML) to effectively integrate the face region descriptors of all blocks (resp. volumes) from an image (resp. a video). Our work achieves the state- of-the-art performances on two real-world datasets LFW and YouTube Faces (YTF) according to the restricted protocol.</p><p>5 0.74449331 <a title="77-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Face_Recognition_in_Movie_Trailers_via_Mean_Sequence_Sparse_Representation-Based_Classification.html">160 cvpr-2013-Face Recognition in Movie Trailers via Mean Sequence Sparse Representation-Based Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Enrique G. Ortiz, Alan Wright, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end video face recognition system, addressing the difficult problem of identifying a video face track using a large dictionary of still face images of a few hundred people, while rejecting unknown individuals. A straightforward application of the popular ?1minimization for face recognition on a frame-by-frame basis is prohibitively expensive, so we propose a novel algorithm Mean Sequence SRC (MSSRC) that performs video face recognition using a joint optimization leveraging all of the available video data and the knowledge that the face track frames belong to the same individual. By adding a strict temporal constraint to the ?1-minimization that forces individual frames in a face track to all reconstruct a single identity, we show the optimization reduces to a single minimization over the mean of the face track. We also introduce a new Movie Trailer Face Dataset collected from 101 movie trailers on YouTube. Finally, we show that our methodmatches or outperforms the state-of-the-art on three existing datasets (YouTube Celebrities, YouTube Faces, and Buffy) and our unconstrained Movie Trailer Face Dataset. More importantly, our method excels at rejecting unknown identities by at least 8% in average precision.</p><p>6 0.73940402 <a title="77-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_and_Aligning_Faces_by_Image_Retrieval.html">119 cvpr-2013-Detecting and Aligning Faces by Image Retrieval</a></p>

To overcome these limitations and take full advantage of the spatio-temporal information, we propose to model the facial expression as a complex activity that consists of temporally overlapping or sequential primitive facial events. We further propose the Interval Temporal Bayesian Network to capture these complex temporal relations among primitive facial events for facial expression modeling and recognition. Experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach in recognizing facial expressions based purely on spatio-temporal relations among facial muscles, as well as its advantage over the existing methods.</p><p>2 0.79250085 <a title="77-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Color_Boundary_Detection_with_Color-Opponent_Mechanisms.html">140 cvpr-2013-Efficient Color Boundary Detection with Color-Opponent Mechanisms</a></p>
<p>Author: Kaifu Yang, Shaobing Gao, Chaoyi Li, Yongjie Li</p><p>Abstract: Color information plays an important role in better understanding of natural scenes by at least facilitating discriminating boundaries of objects or areas. In this study, we propose a new framework for boundary detection in complex natural scenes based on the color-opponent mechanisms of the visual system. The red-green and blue-yellow color opponent channels in the human visual system are regarded as the building blocks for various color perception tasks such as boundary detection. The proposed framework is a feedforward hierarchical model, which has direct counterpart to the color-opponent mechanisms involved in from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1). Results show that our simple framework has excellent ability to flexibly capture both the structured chromatic and achromatic boundaries in complex scenes.</p><p>3 0.75824332 <a title="77-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Recognize_Human_Activities_from_Partially_Observed_Videos.html">347 cvpr-2013-Recognize Human Activities from Partially Observed Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Cao, Daniel Barrett, Andrei Barbu, Siddharth Narayanaswamy, Haonan Yu, Aaron Michaux, Yuewei Lin, Sven Dickinson, Jeffrey Mark Siskind, Song Wang</p><p>Abstract: Recognizing human activities in partially observed videos is a challengingproblem and has many practical applications. When the unobserved subsequence is at the end of the video, the problem is reduced to activity prediction from unfinished activity streaming, which has been studied by many researchers. However, in the general case, an unobserved subsequence may occur at any time by yielding a temporal gap in the video. In this paper, we propose a new method that can recognize human activities from partially observed videos in the general case. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a probabilistic framework: 1) dividing each activity into multiple ordered temporal segments, 2) using spatiotemporal features of the training video samples in each segment as bases and applying sparse coding (SC) to derive the activity likelihood of the test video sample at each segment, and 3) finally combining the likelihood at each segment to achieve a global posterior for the activities. We further extend the proposed method to include more bases that correspond to a mixture of segments with different temporal lengths (MSSC), which can better rep- resent the activities with large intra-class variations. We evaluate the proposed methods (SC and MSSC) on various real videos. We also evaluate the proposed methods on two special cases: 1) activity prediction where the unobserved subsequence is at the end of the video, and 2) human activity recognition on fully observed videos. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform existing state-of-the-art comparison methods.</p><p>4 0.7307049 <a title="77-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Facial_Feature_Tracking_Under_Varying_Facial_Expressions_and_Face_Poses_Based_on_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines.html">161 cvpr-2013-Facial Feature Tracking Under Varying Facial Expressions and Face Poses Based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Wu, Zuoguan Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: Facial feature tracking is an active area in computer vision due to its relevance to many applications. It is a nontrivial task, sincefaces may have varyingfacial expressions, poses or occlusions. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a face shape prior model that is constructed based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and their variants. Specifically, we first construct a model based on Deep Belief Networks to capture the face shape variations due to varying facial expressions for near-frontal view. To handle pose variations, the frontal face shape prior model is incorporated into a 3-way RBM model that could capture the relationship between frontal face shapes and non-frontal face shapes. Finally, we introduce methods to systematically combine the face shape prior models with image measurements of facial feature points. Experiments on benchmark databases show that with the proposed method, facial feature points can be tracked robustly and accurately even if faces have significant facial expressions and poses.</p><p>5 0.72673446 <a title="77-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Lazy_Man%27s_Approach_to_Benchmarking%3A_Semisupervised_Classifier_Evaluation_and_Recalibration.html">15 cvpr-2013-A Lazy Man's Approach to Benchmarking: Semisupervised Classifier Evaluation and Recalibration</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Welinder, Max Welling, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: How many labeled examples are needed to estimate a classifier’s performance on a new dataset? We study the case where data is plentiful, but labels are expensive. We show that by making a few reasonable assumptions on the structure of the data, it is possible to estimate performance curves, with confidence bounds, using a small number of ground truth labels. Our approach, which we call Semisupervised Performance Evaluation (SPE), is based on a generative model for the classifier’s confidence scores. In addition to estimating the performance of classifiers on new datasets, SPE can be used to recalibrate a classifier by reestimating the class-conditional confidence distributions.</p><p>6 0.72664994 <a title="77-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Elastic_Matching_for_Pose_Variant_Face_Verification.html">338 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Elastic Matching for Pose Variant Face Verification</a></p>

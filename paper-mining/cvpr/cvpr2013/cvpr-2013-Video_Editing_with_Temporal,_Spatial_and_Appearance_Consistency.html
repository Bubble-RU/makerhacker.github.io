<p>Author: Ehsan Shahrian, Deepu Rajan, Brian Price, Scott Cohen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new image matting algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset of images. This is achieved by solving two major problems encountered by current sampling based algorithms. The first is that the range in which the foreground and background are sampled is often limited to such an extent that the true foreground and background colors are not present. Here, we describe a method by which a more comprehensive and representative set of samples is collected so as not to miss out on the true samples. This is accomplished by expanding the sampling range for pixels farther from the foreground or background boundary and ensuring that samples from each color distribution are included. The second problem is the overlap in color distributions of foreground and background regions. This causes sampling based methods to fail to pick the correct samples for foreground and background. Our design of an objective function forces those foreground and background samples to be picked that are generated from well-separated distributions. Comparison on the dataset at and evaluation by www.alphamatting.com shows that the proposed method ranks first in terms of error measures used in the website.</p><p>3 0.20382868 <a title="453-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Image_Matting_with_Local_and_Nonlocal_Smooth_Priors.html">211 cvpr-2013-Image Matting with Local and Nonlocal Smooth Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaowu Chen, Dongqing Zou, Steven Zhiying Zhou, Qinping Zhao, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel alpha matting method with local and nonlocal smooth priors. We observe that the manifold preserving editing propagation [4] essentially introduced a nonlocal smooth prior on the alpha matte. This nonlocal smooth prior and the well known local smooth priorfrom matting Laplacian complement each other. So we combine them with a simple data term from color sampling in a graph model for nature image matting. Our method has a closed-form solution and can be solved efficiently. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method produces more accurate results according to the evaluation on standard benchmark datasets.</p><p>4 0.1625203 <a title="453-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Single-Sample_Face_Recognition_with_Image_Corruption_and_Misalignment_via_Sparse_Illumination_Transfer.html">399 cvpr-2013-Single-Sample Face Recognition with Image Corruption and Misalignment via Sparse Illumination Transfer</a></p>
<p>Author: Liansheng Zhuang, Allen Y. Yang, Zihan Zhou, S. Shankar Sastry, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Single-sample face recognition is one of the most challenging problems in face recognition. We propose a novel face recognition algorithm to address this problem based on a sparse representation based classification (SRC) framework. The new algorithm is robust to image misalignment and pixel corruption, and is able to reduce required training images to one sample per class. To compensate the missing illumination information typically provided by multiple training images, a sparse illumination transfer (SIT) technique is introduced. The SIT algorithms seek additional illumination examples of face images from one or more additional subject classes, and form an illumination dictionary. By enforcing a sparse representation of the query image, the method can recover and transfer the pose and illumination information from the alignment stage to the recognition stage. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that the new algorithms significantly outperform the existing algorithms in the single-sample regime and with less restrictions. In particular, the face alignment accuracy is comparable to that of the well-known Deformable SRC algorithm using multiple training images; and the face recognition accuracy exceeds those ofthe SRC andExtended SRC algorithms using hand labeled alignment initialization.</p><p>5 0.15071402 <a title="453-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Occlusion_Patterns_for_Object_Class_Detection.html">311 cvpr-2013-Occlusion Patterns for Object Class Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Bojan Pepikj, Michael Stark, Peter Gehler, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: Despite the success of recent object class recognition systems, the long-standing problem of partial occlusion remains a major challenge, and a principled solution is yet to be found. In this paper we leave the beaten path of methods that treat occlusion as just another source of noise instead, we include the occluder itself into the modelling, by mining distinctive, reoccurring occlusion patterns from annotated training data. These patterns are then used as training data for dedicated detectors of varying sophistication. In particular, we evaluate and compare models that range from standard object class detectors to hierarchical, part-based representations of occluder/occludee pairs. In an extensive evaluation we derive insights that can aid further developments in tackling the occlusion challenge. –</p><p>6 0.13470522 <a title="453-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploring_Weak_Stabilization_for_Motion_Feature_Extraction.html">158 cvpr-2013-Exploring Weak Stabilization for Motion Feature Extraction</a></p>

<p>Author: Yannis Panagakis, Mihalis A. Nicolaou, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Maja Pantic</p><p>Abstract: Temporal alignment of human behaviour from visual data is a very challenging problem due to a numerous reasons, including possible large temporal scale differences, inter/intra subject variability and, more importantly, due to the presence of gross errors and outliers. Gross errors are often in abundance due to incorrect localization and tracking, presence of partial occlusion etc. Furthermore, such errors rarely follow a Gaussian distribution, which is the de-facto assumption in machine learning methods. In this paper, building on recent advances on rank minimization and compressive sensing, a novel, robust to gross errors temporal alignment method is proposed. While previous approaches combine the dynamic time warping (DTW) with low-dimensional projections that maximally correlate two sequences, we aim to learn two underlyingprojection matrices (one for each sequence), which not only maximally correlate the sequences but, at the same time, efficiently remove the possible corruptions in any datum in the sequences. The projections are obtained by minimizing the weighted sum of nuclear and ?1 norms, by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, while the temporal alignment is found by applying the DTW in an alternating fashion. The superiority of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art time alignment methods, namely the canonical time warping and the generalized time warping, is indicated by the experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets.</p><p>5 0.6869905 <a title="453-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Background_Modeling_Based_on_Bidirectional_Analysis.html">55 cvpr-2013-Background Modeling Based on Bidirectional Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Atsushi Shimada, Hajime Nagahara, Rin-ichiro Taniguchi</p><p>Abstract: Background modeling and subtraction is an essential task in video surveillance applications. Most traditional studies use information observed in past frames to create and update a background model. To adapt to background changes, the backgroundmodel has been enhancedby introducing various forms of information including spatial consistency and temporal tendency. In this paper, we propose a new framework that leverages information from a future period. Our proposed approach realizes a low-cost and highly accurate background model. The proposed framework is called bidirectional background modeling, and performs background subtraction based on bidirectional analysis; i.e., analysis from past to present and analysis from future to present. Although a result will be output with some delay because information is takenfrom a futureperiod, our proposed approach improves the accuracy by about 30% if only a 33-millisecond of delay is acceptable. Furthermore, the memory cost can be reduced by about 65% relative to typical background modeling.</p><p>6 0.65467781 <a title="453-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Jointly_Aligning_and_Segmenting_Multiple_Web_Photo_Streams_for_the_Inference_of_Collective_Photo_Storylines.html">235 cvpr-2013-Jointly Aligning and Segmenting Multiple Web Photo Streams for the Inference of Collective Photo Storylines</a></p>

<p>Author: Gim Hee Lee, Friedrich Faundorfer, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a visual ego-motion estimation algorithm for a self-driving car equipped with a closeto-market multi-camera system. By modeling the multicamera system as a generalized camera and applying the non-holonomic motion constraint of a car, we show that this leads to a novel 2-point minimal solution for the generalized essential matrix where the full relative motion including metric scale can be obtained. We provide the analytical solutions for the general case with at least one inter-camera correspondence and a special case with only intra-camera correspondences. We show that up to a maximum of 6 solutions exist for both cases. We identify the existence of degeneracy when the car undergoes straight motion in the special case with only intra-camera correspondences where the scale becomes unobservable and provide a practical alternative solution. Our formulation can be efficiently implemented within RANSAC for robust estimation. We verify the validity of our assumptions on the motion model by comparing our results on a large real-world dataset collected by a car equipped with 4 cameras with minimal overlapping field-of-views against the GPS/INS ground truth.</p><p>3 0.87946403 <a title="453-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution_Shape_Analysis_via_Non-Euclidean_Wavelets%3A_Applications_to_Mesh_Segmentation_and_Surface_Alignment_Problems.html">297 cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution Shape Analysis via Non-Euclidean Wavelets: Applications to Mesh Segmentation and Surface Alignment Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Won Hwa Kim, Moo K. Chung, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of 3-D shape meshes is a fundamental problem in computer vision, graphics, and medical imaging. Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape ’s local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks). We give an extensive set of comparison results on a large shape segmentation benchmark and derive a uniqueness theorem for the surface alignment problem.</p><p>4 0.8751654 <a title="453-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Recovering_Stereo_Pairs_from_Anaglyphs.html">352 cvpr-2013-Recovering Stereo Pairs from Anaglyphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Armand Joulin, Sing Bing Kang</p><p>Abstract: An anaglyph is a single image created by selecting complementary colors from a stereo color pair; the user can perceive depth by viewing it through color-filtered glasses. We propose a technique to reconstruct the original color stereo pair given such an anaglyph. We modified SIFT-Flow and use it to initially match the different color channels across the two views. Our technique then iteratively refines the matches, selects the good matches (which defines the “anchor” colors), and propagates the anchor colors. We use a diffusion-based technique for the color propagation, and added a step to suppress unwanted colors. Results on a variety of inputs demonstrate the robustness of our technique. We also extended our method to anaglyph videos by using optic flow between time frames.</p><p>5 0.87512988 <a title="453-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Vantage_Feature_Frames_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization.html">452 cvpr-2013-Vantage Feature Frames for Fine-Grained Categorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Asma Rejeb Sfar, Nozha Boujemaa, Donald Geman</p><p>Abstract: We study fine-grained categorization, the task of distinguishing among (sub)categories of the same generic object class (e.g., birds), focusing on determining botanical species (leaves and orchids) from scanned images. The strategy is to focus attention around several vantage points, which is the approach taken by botanists, but using features dedicated to the individual categories. Our implementation of the strategy is based on vantage feature frames, a novel object representation consisting of two components: a set of coordinate systems centered at the most discriminating local viewpoints for the generic object class and a set of category-dependentfeatures computed in these frames. The features are pooled over frames to build the classifier. Categorization then proceeds from coarse-grained (finding the frames) to fine-grained (finding the category), and hence the vantage feature frames must be both detectable and discriminating. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the art algorithms, in particular those using more distributed representations, on standard databases of leaves.</p><p>6 0.87379354 <a title="453-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Measuring_Crowd_Collectiveness.html">282 cvpr-2013-Measuring Crowd Collectiveness</a></p>

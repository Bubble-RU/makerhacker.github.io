<p>Author: Zhaoyin Jia, Andrew Gallagher, Ashutosh Saxena, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: 3D volumetric reasoning is important for truly understanding a scene. Humans are able to both segment each object in an image, and perceive a rich 3D interpretation of the scene, e.g., the space an object occupies, which objects support other objects, and which objects would, if moved, cause other objects to fall. We propose a new approach for parsing RGB-D images using 3D block units for volumetric reasoning. The algorithm fits image segments with 3D blocks, and iteratively evaluates the scene based on block interaction properties. We produce a 3D representation of the scene based on jointly optimizing over segmentations, block fitting, supporting relations, and object stability. Our algorithm incorporates the intuition that a good 3D representation of the scene is the one that fits the data well, and is a stable, self-supporting (i.e., one that does not topple) arrangement of objects. We experiment on several datasets including controlled and real indoor scenarios. Results show that our stability-reasoning framework improves RGB-D segmentation and scene volumetric representation.</p><p>3 0.29921231 <a title="364-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Bottom-Up_Segmentation_for_Top-Down_Detection.html">70 cvpr-2013-Bottom-Up Segmentation for Top-Down Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Sanja Fidler, Roozbeh Mottaghi, Alan Yuille, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we are interested in how semantic segmentation can help object detection. Towards this goal, we propose a novel deformable part-based model which exploits region-based segmentation algorithms that compute candidate object regions by bottom-up clustering followed by ranking of those regions. Our approach allows every detection hypothesis to select a segment (including void), and scores each box in the image using both the traditional HOG filters as well as a set of novel segmentation features. Thus our model “blends ” between the detector and segmentation models. Since our features can be computed very efficiently given the segments, we maintain the same complexity as the original DPM [14]. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in PASCAL VOC 2010, and show that when employing only a root filter our approach outperforms Dalal & Triggs detector [12] on all classes, achieving 13% higher average AP. When employing the parts, we outperform the original DPM [14] in 19 out of 20 classes, achieving an improvement of 8% AP. Furthermore, we outperform the previous state-of-the-art on VOC’10 test by 4%.</p><p>4 0.24574603 <a title="364-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Collections_of_Part_Models_for_Object_Recognition.html">248 cvpr-2013-Learning Collections of Part Models for Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ian Endres, Kevin J. Shih, Johnston Jiaa, Derek Hoiem</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to learn a diverse collection of discriminative parts from object bounding box annotations. Part detectors can be trained and applied individually, which simplifies learning and extension to new features or categories. We apply the parts to object category detection, pooling part detections within bottom-up proposed regions and using a boosted classifier with proposed sigmoid weak learners for scoring. On PASCAL VOC 2010, we evaluate the part detectors ’ ability to discriminate and localize annotated keypoints. Our detection system is competitive with the best-existing systems, outperforming other HOG-based detectors on the more deformable categories.</p><p>5 0.19595394 <a title="364-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Looking_Beyond_the_Image%3A_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Object_Saliency_and_Detection.html">273 cvpr-2013-Looking Beyond the Image: Unsupervised Learning for Object Saliency and Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Parthipan Siva, Chris Russell, Tao Xiang, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: We propose a principled probabilistic formulation of object saliency as a sampling problem. This novel formulation allows us to learn, from a large corpus of unlabelled images, which patches of an image are of the greatest interest and most likely to correspond to an object. We then sample the object saliency map to propose object locations. We show that using only a single object location proposal per image, we are able to correctly select an object in over 42% of the images in the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, substantially outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, we show that our object proposal can be used as a simple unsupervised approach to the weakly supervised annotation problem. Our simple unsupervised approach to annotating objects of interest in images achieves a higher annotation accuracy than most weakly supervised approaches.</p><p>6 0.15101808 <a title="364-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Single-Pedestrian_Detection_Aided_by_Multi-pedestrian_Detection.html">398 cvpr-2013-Single-Pedestrian Detection Aided by Multi-pedestrian Detection</a></p>

We propose a novel framework that explores the compatibility between segmentation hypotheses of the object in the image and the corresponding 3D map. Our framework allows to discover the optimal location of the object using a generalization of the structural latent SVM formulation in 3D as well as the definition of a new loss function defined over the 3D space in training. We evaluate our method using two existing RGB-D datasets. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-theart as methods well as a number of baseline approaches for both 3D and 2D object recognition tasks.</p><p>6 0.77675533 <a title="364-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Subcategory-Aware_Object_Classification.html">417 cvpr-2013-Subcategory-Aware Object Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Jianchao Yang, Zhe Lin, Scott Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a fast regression model for practical single image super-resolution based on in-place examples, by leveraging two fundamental super-resolution approaches— learning from an external database and learning from selfexamples. Our in-place self-similarity refines the recently proposed local self-similarity by proving that a patch in the upper scale image have good matches around its origin location in the lower scale image. Based on the in-place examples, a first-order approximation of the nonlinear mapping function from low- to high-resolution image patches is learned. Extensive experiments on benchmark and realworld images demonstrate that our algorithm can produce natural-looking results with sharp edges and preserved fine details, while the current state-of-the-art algorithms are prone to visual artifacts. Furthermore, our model can easily extend to deal with noise by combining the regression results on multiple in-place examples for robust estimation. The algorithm runs fast and is particularly useful for practical applications, where the input images typically contain diverse textures and they are potentially contaminated by noise or compression artifacts.</p><p>2 0.91451973 <a title="364-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Nonlinearly_Constrained_MRFs%3A_Exploring_the_Intrinsic_Dimensions_of_Higher-Order_Cliques.html">308 cvpr-2013-Nonlinearly Constrained MRFs: Exploring the Intrinsic Dimensions of Higher-Order Cliques</a></p>

Motivated by the observation that many non-local statistics (e.g., shape priors, color distributions) can usually be represented by a small number of parameters, we reformulate the higher-order MRF model by introducing additional latent variables to represent the intrinsic dimensions of the higher-order cliques. The resulting new model, called NC-MRF, not only provides the flexibility in representing the configurations of higher-order cliques, but also automatically decomposes the energy function into less coupled terms, allowing us to design an efficient algorithmic framework for maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Based on this novel modeling/inference framework, we achieve state-of-the-art solutions to the challenging problems of class-specific image segmentation and template-based 3D facial expression tracking, which demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>3 0.91140991 <a title="364-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Tensor-Based_High-Order_Semantic_Relation_Transfer_for_Semantic_Scene_Segmentation.html">425 cvpr-2013-Tensor-Based High-Order Semantic Relation Transfer for Semantic Scene Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Heesoo Myeong, Kyoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric approach for semantic segmentation using high-order semantic relations. Conventional context models mainly focus on learning pairwise relationships between objects. Pairwise relations, however, are not enough to represent high-level contextual knowledge within images. In this paper, we propose semantic relation transfer, a method to transfer high-order semantic relations of objects from annotated images to unlabeled images analogous to label transfer techniques where label information are transferred. Wefirst define semantic tensors representing high-order relations of objects. Semantic relation transfer problem is then formulated as semi-supervised learning using a quadratic objective function of the semantic tensors. By exploiting low-rank property of the semantic tensors and employing Kronecker sum similarity, an efficient approximation algorithm is developed. Based on the predicted high-order semantic relations, we reason semantic segmentation and evaluate the performance on several challenging datasets.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.8899259 <a title="364-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Object_Co-detection.html">364 cvpr-2013-Robust Object Co-detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xin Guo, Dong Liu, Brendan Jou, Mojun Zhu, Anni Cai, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Object co-detection aims at simultaneous detection of objects of the same category from a pool of related images by exploiting consistent visual patterns present in candidate objects in the images. The related image set may contain a mixture of annotated objects and candidate objects generated by automatic detectors. Co-detection differs from the conventional object detection paradigm in which detection over each test image is determined one-by-one independently without taking advantage of common patterns in the data pool. In this paper, we propose a novel, robust approach to dramatically enhance co-detection by extracting a shared low-rank representation of the object instances in multiple feature spaces. The idea is analogous to that of the well-known Robust PCA [28], but has not been explored in object co-detection so far. The representation is based on a linear reconstruction over the entire data set and the low-rank approach enables effective removal of noisy and outlier samples. The extracted low-rank representation can be used to detect the target objects by spectral clustering. Extensive experiments over diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art object codetection method and the generic object detection methods without co-detection formulations.</p><p>5 0.88581759 <a title="364-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Improved_Image_Set_Classification_via_Joint_Sparse_Approximated_Nearest_Subspaces.html">215 cvpr-2013-Improved Image Set Classification via Joint Sparse Approximated Nearest Subspaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Shaokang Chen, Conrad Sanderson, Mehrtash T. Harandi, Brian C. Lovell</p><p>Abstract: Existing multi-model approaches for image set classification extract local models by clustering each image set individually only once, with fixed clusters used for matching with other image sets. However, this may result in the two closest clusters to represent different characteristics of an object, due to different undesirable environmental conditions (such as variations in illumination and pose). To address this problem, we propose to constrain the clustering of each query image set by forcing the clusters to have resemblance to the clusters in the gallery image sets. We first define a Frobenius norm distance between subspaces over Grassmann manifolds based on reconstruction error. We then extract local linear subspaces from a gallery image set via sparse representation. For each local linear subspace, we adaptively construct the corresponding closest subspace from the samples of a probe image set by joint sparse representation. We show that by minimising the sparse representation reconstruction error, we approach the nearest point on a Grassmann manifold. Experiments on Honda, ETH-80 and Cambridge-Gesture datasets show that the proposed method consistently outperforms several other recent techniques, such as Affine Hull based Image Set Distance (AHISD), Sparse Approximated Nearest Points (SANP) and Manifold Discriminant Analysis (MDA).</p><p>6 0.87972546 <a title="364-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Adding_Unlabeled_Samples_to_Categories_by_Learned_Attributes.html">36 cvpr-2013-Adding Unlabeled Samples to Categories by Learned Attributes</a></p>

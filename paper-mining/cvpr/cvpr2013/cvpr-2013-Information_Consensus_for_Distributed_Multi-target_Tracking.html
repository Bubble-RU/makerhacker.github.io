</p><p>7 The incorporation of the probabilistic data association mecha-  nism makes the MTIC algorithm very robust to false measurements/clutter. [sent-13, score-0.23]
</p><p>8 Multiple sensors can cover more area, provide views from different angles and the fusion of all their measurements may lead to robust scene understanding. [sent-17, score-0.254]
</p><p>9 For example, C1 gets direct measurements about T1 which it shares with its immediate network neighbor, C2 . [sent-28, score-0.264]
</p><p>10 To motivate the core contribution of this work, we first describe the inter-  distributed1  relationship between distributed estimation and camera networks. [sent-37, score-0.342]
</p><p>11 Most of the work in distributed tracking has been in the multi-agent systems community [7]. [sent-38, score-0.366]
</p><p>12 The methods there assume that each target can be viewed by each sensor which may not be true for many application scenarios, especially for a camera network (see Fig. [sent-39, score-0.466]
</p><p>13 This limits the 1We use the term distributed to mean that each camera processes its own data and arrives at a final solution through negotiations with its neighbors; there is no central processor. [sent-41, score-0.306]
</p><p>14 The term distributed has been also used in computer vision to refer to a camera network that is distributed over a wide area but where the processing is centralized. [sent-42, score-0.674]
</p><p>15 In this paper, our goal is to design a distributed multi-target tracking scheme which is suited for such sensors with limited field-of-view (FOV). [sent-44, score-0.465]
</p><p>16 A distributed multi-target tracking problem can be divided into three sub-problems, namely, distributed information fusion, data association (measurement to track association) and dynamic state estimation. [sent-45, score-0.98]
</p><p>17 Among many types of distributed information fusion approaches, consensus algorithms [7] are schemes where each node, corrects its own state using information only from its network neighbors. [sent-46, score-0.885]
</p><p>18 By iteratively doing so, each node can individually compute a global function of the prior state and measurement infor-  mation of all the nodes (e. [sent-47, score-0.479]
</p><p>19 The important fact is that consensus is reached without all-to-all communication; thus consensus based frameworks do not require any specific communication network topology and are generally applicable to any arbitrary, connected network. [sent-50, score-0.845]
</p><p>20 The consensus estimates asymptotically converge to the global result. [sent-51, score-0.331]
</p><p>21 Due to the simplicity and robustness of consensus algorithms, they have been used in many applications, including estimation problems in sensor networks (e. [sent-53, score-0.529]
</p><p>22 In a distributed multi-target tracking scheme, each node may need to maintain a state estimate of each target even though it is not directly observing the target, since the nodes will need to collaborate with each other. [sent-56, score-0.807]
</p><p>23 Each node gets measurements of the targets and must associate the measurements to the appropriate target’s track. [sent-57, score-0.449]
</p><p>24 In a consensusbased scheme, each node maintains its own copy of the state estimates of all the targets which makes consensus-based approaches inherently appropriate for our problem. [sent-58, score-0.367]
</p><p>25 We call a node ‘naive’ about a target when there are no measurements of that target available in its local neighborhood (consisting of the node and its immediate network  neighbors). [sent-62, score-0.816]
</p><p>26 In such a situation, in a consensus-based framework, due to limited local observability and limited number of consensus iterations, the naive node has access to less information about the target’s state. [sent-63, score-0.56]
</p><p>27 A well-known consensus-based scheme for distributed state estimation is the Kalman Consensus Filter (KCF) [6]. [sent-64, score-0.393]
</p><p>28 Moreover, the cross-covariance terms between the state estimates at different nodes were not incorporated in the estimation process in KCF as they are usually hard to compute in a distributed environment. [sent-68, score-0.47]
</p><p>29 Recently, the Information-weighted Consensus Filter (ICF) [5] was proposed to address the issues with both naivety and optimality for the distributed state estimation problem. [sent-70, score-0.56]
</p><p>30 For a multi-target tracking problem, the data association and the tracking steps are highly inter-dependent. [sent-72, score-0.476]
</p><p>31 The performance of tracking will affect the performance of data association and vice-versa. [sent-73, score-0.353]
</p><p>32 Thus, an integrated distributed tracking and data association solution is required where the uncertainty from the tracker can be incorporated in the data association process and  vice-versa. [sent-74, score-0.855]
</p><p>33 As distributed solutions are usually applied to low-power wireless sensor networks where the computational and communication power is limited, the JPDAF scheme will be utilized in the proposed distributed multi-target tracking framework. [sent-78, score-0.881]
</p><p>34 The main contribution of this paper is the tight integration of data association with state-of-the-art distributed single target tracking methods, taking special care of the issue of naivety, and demonstration of its performance in the case of a camera network. [sent-79, score-0.797]
</p><p>35 For example, in [4], a centralized approach for tracking in a multi-camera setup was proposed where the cam-  eras were distributed spatially over a large area. [sent-89, score-0.483]
</p><p>36 However, in this paper, we deal with the distributed multi-target tracking problem where there is no centralized server, the processing is distributed over all the camera nodes and no target hand-off strategy is required. [sent-91, score-0.978]
</p><p>37 Various methods for distributed multi-target tracking have been proposed in the sensor-networks literature. [sent-92, score-0.366]
</p><p>38 In [3], a solution to the dis222444000422  tributed data association problem was proposed by means of the message passing algorithm based on graphical models in which iterative, parallel exchange of information among the nodes viewing the same target was required. [sent-93, score-0.446]
</p><p>39 In [8, 10, 11], the distributed multi-target tracking schemes did not account for naivety or the presence of cross-correlation between the estimates at different nodes. [sent-95, score-0.559]
</p><p>40 Problem Formulation Consider a sensor network with NC sensors. [sent-100, score-0.265]
</p><p>41 The set of nodes having direct communication channel with node Ci (sharing an edge with Ci) is represented by Ni. [sent-109, score-0.273]
</p><p>42 The state of the jth target is represented by the vector xj ∈ Rp. [sent-115, score-0.302]
</p><p>43 For example, for a tracking application in a camera ∈ne Rtwork, xj might be a vector containing ground plane position and velocity components. [sent-116, score-0.236]
</p><p>44 The state dynamics of target Tj are modeled as xj(t + 1) = Φxj(t) + γj(t). [sent-117, score-0.252]
</p><p>45 At time t, e(at)ch is sensor Ci, depending on its FOV and the location of the targets, gets li(t) measurements denoted as  {zin}lni=(t1). [sent-119, score-0.251]
</p><p>46 Under the hypothesis that the observation zin is generated from Tj, it is assumed that zin was generated by the following observation model zin =  Hijxij + νij. [sent-121, score-0.264]
</p><p>47 Each node also maintains a prior/predicted state estimate (and its covariance for each target. [sent-124, score-0.299]
</p><p>48 Throughout this paper, the inverse of the state covariance matrix (information/precision matrix) will be used and denoted as = We assume that the initial prior state estimate and information matrix is available to each node for each target upon its detection. [sent-125, score-0.615]
</p><p>49 , , find the state estimate for each target at each node by using the prior and measurement information available in the entire network in a distributed fashion. [sent-128, score-0.961]
</p><p>50 A critical step in this process is association of measurements with targets, which is the topic of this paper. [sent-129, score-0.341]
</p><p>51 Average consensus Average consensus [7] is a popular distributed algorithm to compute the arithmetic mean of some values {ai}iN=C1 . [sent-133, score-0.853]
</p><p>52 InP average consensus algorithm, each node initializes its consPensus state as ai (0) = ai and iteratively communicates with its neighbors and updates its own state information. [sent-138, score-0.771]
</p><p>53 At the beginning of iteration k, a node Ci sends its previous state ai (k −1) to its immediate network neighbors Ci0 ∈ Ni  and also(k kr−ec1ei)v teos t hse im neighbors’ previous istgahtebso ai0 (k ∈− 1 N). [sent-139, score-0.455]
</p><p>54 i0X∈Ni(ai0(k − 1) − ai(k − 1)) = A(ai (k  −  1))  (3)  Here A(ai) is a shorthand mathematical operator for a single step aof average consensus (defined as the above). [sent-142, score-0.305]
</p><p>55 The average consensus algorithm can be used to compute the average of vectors and matrices by applying it to their individual elements separately. [sent-144, score-0.305]
</p><p>56 Average consensus assumes all agents have an estimate for all elements of a and that all estimates are of equal accuracy and uncorrelated. [sent-149, score-0.331]
</p><p>57 These distributed estimation frameworks have been applied in various fields including camera networks for distributed implementations of 3-D point triangulation, pose estimation  [12], and action recognition [11]. [sent-152, score-0.695]
</p><p>58 The average consensus algorithm is applicable only for a static parameter estimation problem. [sent-153, score-0.341]
</p><p>59 Kalman Consensus Filter The Kalman Consensus Filter (KCF) [6] is a popular distributed dynamic state estimation framework. [sent-157, score-0.393]
</p><p>60 KCF utilizes the average consensus algorithm to average the state estimates over different nodes at each time step. [sent-158, score-0.496]
</p><p>61 Information Weighted Consensus In [5], the Information-weighted Consensus Filter (ICF) algorithm was proposed, which is a distributed state estimation framework that accounts for the naivety issue and can achieve optimal performance equivalent to a centralized solution. [sent-176, score-0.677]
</p><p>62 Thus a node which has less information about a target’s state is given  less weight in the overall estimation process. [sent-180, score-0.315]
</p><p>63 Multi-target data association The KCF and the ICF algorithms assume that the data association (which measurement belongs to which target) is known. [sent-183, score-0.599]
</p><p>64 For a realistic multi-target state estimation problem, solving data association is itself a challenging problem even in the centralized case. [sent-184, score-0.497]
</p><p>65 Here we briefly review the Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (JPDAF) [1] algorithm which is the starting point of the proposed multisensor multi-target distributed tracking algorithm. [sent-185, score-0.399]
</p><p>66 The JPDAF is a single sensor algorithm, thus the sensor index iis unnecessary and will be dropped. [sent-186, score-0.28]
</p><p>67 A double superscript zjn is required for the hypothesis that measurement zn is associated with target Tj . [sent-187, score-0.379]
</p><p>68 The Kalman gain Kj, mean measurement yj and mean measurement innovation y˜j for target Tj are defined as  Kj  =  yj  =  Pj−HjT(Sj)−1,  (12)  Xl  Xβjnzn,  (13)  nX= X1 Xl  y˜j  =  Xβjn z˜jn = yj − (1 − βj0)Hj xˆj−. [sent-190, score-0.596]
</p><p>69 This will then be used in the next section to derive the distributed multi-target tracking algorithm. [sent-204, score-0.366]
</p><p>70 (18), Jj− xˆj−is the weighted prior information and uj + βj0Uj ˆxj−is the weighted measurement information (taking data association uncertainty βj0 into account). [sent-219, score-0.543]
</p><p>71 To incorporate measurement information from an additional sensor, the weighted measurement information from that sensor has to be added to this summation. [sent-221, score-0.472]
</p><p>72 This is a property of estimators in the information form for combining measurements from multiple sensors, when noise in those measurements is uncorrelated with each other, which we assume in this work. [sent-222, score-0.249]
</p><p>73 Based on the data association results derived in the previous section and the ICF, we will now derive a distributed multitarget tracking algorithm. [sent-231, score-0.63]
</p><p>74 Now, in a distributed system, each node will have its own prior information { ˆxij−, Jji−}. [sent-233, score-0.445]

Roy-Chowdhury</p><p>Abstract: Due to their high fault-tolerance, ease of installation and scalability to large networks, distributed algorithms have recently gained immense popularity in the sensor networks community, especially in computer vision. Multitarget tracking in a camera network is one of the fundamental problems in this domain. Distributed estimation algorithms work by exchanging information between sensors that are communication neighbors. Since most cameras are directional sensors, it is often the case that neighboring sensors may not be sensing the same target. Such sensors that do not have information about a target are termed as “naive ” with respect to that target. In this paper, we propose consensus-based distributed multi-target tracking algorithms in a camera network that are designed to address this issue of naivety. The estimation errors in tracking and data association, as well as the effect of naivety, are jointly addressed leading to the development of an informationweighted consensus algorithm, which we term as the Multitarget Information Consensus (MTIC) algorithm. The incorporation of the probabilistic data association mecha- nism makes the MTIC algorithm very robust to false measurements/clutter.

<p>Author: Vittal Premachandran, Ramakrishna Kakarala</p><p>Abstract: Propagating similarity information along the data manifold requires careful selection of local neighborhood. Selecting a “good” neighborhood in an unsupervised setting, given an affinity graph, has been a difficult task. The most common way to select a local neighborhood has been to use the k-nearest neighborhood (k-NN) selection criterion. However, it has the tendency to include noisy edges. In this paper, we propose a way to select a robust neighborhood using the consensus of multiple rounds of k-NNs. We explain how using consensus information can give better control over neighborhood selection. We also explain in detail the problems with another recently proposed neighborhood selection criteria, i.e., Dominant Neighbors, and show that our method is immune to those problems.

The results corroborate our claims that consensus ofk-NNs does indeed help in selecting more robust and stable localities.</p><p>3 0.14625138 <a title="224-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Rank-1_Tensor_Approximation.html">301 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Rank-1 Tensor Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinchu Shi, Haibin Ling, Junling Xing, Weiming Hu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we formulate multi-target tracking (MTT) as a rank-1 tensor approximation problem and propose an ?1 norm tensor power iteration solution. In particular, a high order tensor is constructed based on trajectories in the time window, with each tensor element as the affinity of the corresponding trajectory candidate. The local assignment variables are the ?1 normalized vectors, which are used to approximate the rank-1 tensor. Our approach provides a flexible and effective formulation where both pairwise and high-order association energies can be used expediently. We also show the close relation between our formulation and the multi-dimensional assignment (MDA) model. To solve the optimization in the rank-1 tensor approximation, we propose an algorithm that iteratively powers the intermediate solution followed by an ?1 normalization. Aside from effectively capturing high-order motion information, the proposed solver runs efficiently with proved convergence. The experimental validations are conducted on two challenging datasets and our method demonstrates promising performances on both.</p><p>4 0.14131179 <a title="224-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Lagrangian_Relaxation_to_Min-cost_Network_Flow.html">300 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Lagrangian Relaxation to Min-cost Network Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Asad A. Butt, Robert T. Collins</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for global multi-target tracking that can incorporate higher-order track smoothness constraints such as constant velocity. Our problem formulation readily lends itself to path estimation in a trellis graph, but unlike previous methods, each node in our network represents a candidate pair of matching observations between consecutive frames. Extra constraints on binary flow variables in the graph result in a problem that can no longer be solved by min-cost network flow. We therefore propose an iterative solution method that relaxes these extra constraints using Lagrangian relaxation, resulting in a series of problems that ARE solvable by min-cost flow, and that progressively improve towards a high-quality solution to our original optimization problem. We present experimental results showing that our method outperforms the standard network-flow formulation as well as other recent algorithms that attempt to incorporate higher-order smoothness constraints.</p><p>5 0.11520536 <a title="224-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Hypergraphs_for_Joint_Multi-view_Reconstruction_and_Multi-object_Tracking.html">209 cvpr-2013-Hypergraphs for Joint Multi-view Reconstruction and Multi-object Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Ahmed T. Kamal, Jay A. Farrell, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury</p><p>Abstract: Due to their high fault-tolerance, ease of installation and scalability to large networks, distributed algorithms have recently gained immense popularity in the sensor networks community, especially in computer vision. Multitarget tracking in a camera network is one of the fundamental problems in this domain. Distributed estimation algorithms work by exchanging information between sensors that are communication neighbors. Since most cameras are directional sensors, it is often the case that neighboring sensors may not be sensing the same target. Such sensors that do not have information about a target are termed as “naive ” with respect to that target. In this paper, we propose consensus-based distributed multi-target tracking algorithms in a camera network that are designed to address this issue of naivety. The estimation errors in tracking and data association, as well as the effect of naivety, are jointly addressed leading to the development of an informationweighted consensus algorithm, which we term as the Multitarget Information Consensus (MTIC) algorithm. The incorporation of the probabilistic data association mecha- nism makes the MTIC algorithm very robust to false measurements/clutter. Experimental analysis is provided to support the theoretical results.</p><p>2 0.71373016 <a title="224-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Rank-1_Tensor_Approximation.html">301 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Rank-1 Tensor Approximation</a></p>

<p>Author: Anton Milan, Konrad Schindler, Stefan Roth</p><p>Abstract: When tracking multiple targets in crowded scenarios, modeling mutual exclusion between distinct targets becomes important at two levels: (1) in data association, each target observation should support at most one trajectory and each trajectory should be assigned at most one observation per frame; (2) in trajectory estimation, two trajectories should remain spatially separated at all times to avoid collisions. Yet, existing trackers often sidestep these important constraints. We address this using a mixed discrete-continuous conditional randomfield (CRF) that explicitly models both types of constraints: Exclusion between conflicting observations with supermodular pairwise terms, and exclusion between trajectories by generalizing global label costs to suppress the co-occurrence of incompatible labels (trajectories). We develop an expansion move-based MAP estimation scheme that handles both non-submodular constraints and pairwise global label costs. Furthermore, we perform a statistical analysis of ground-truth trajectories to derive appropriate CRF potentials for modeling data fidelity, target dynamics, and inter-target occlusion.</p><p>6 0.63008726 <a title="224-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Gauging_Association_Patterns_of_Chromosome_Territories_via_Chromatic_Median.html">184 cvpr-2013-Gauging Association Patterns of Chromosome Territories via Chromatic Median</a></p>

<p>Author: Hyeongwoo Kim, Hailin Jin, Sunil Hadap, Inso Kweon</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method to separate specular reflection from a single image. Separating an image into diffuse and specular components is an ill-posed problem due to lack of observations. Existing methods rely on a specularfree image to detect and estimate specularity, which however may confuse diffuse pixels with the same hue but a different saturation value as specular pixels. Our method is based on a novel observation that for most natural images the dark channel can provide an approximate specular-free image. We also propose a maximum a posteriori formulation which robustly recovers the specular reflection and chromaticity despite of the hue-saturation ambiguity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on real and synthetic examples. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-theart methods in separating specular reflection.</p><p>2 0.83620316 <a title="224-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_Pulse_from_Head_Motions_in_Video.html">118 cvpr-2013-Detecting Pulse from Head Motions in Video</a></p>

Our method tracks features on the head and performs principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose their trajectories into a set of component motions. It then chooses the component that best corresponds to heartbeats based on its temporal frequency spectrum. Finally, we analyze the motion projected to this component and identify peaks of the trajectories, which correspond to heartbeats. When evaluated on 18 subjects, our approach reported heart rates nearly identical to an electrocardiogram device. Additionally we were able to capture clinically relevant information about heart rate variability.</p><p>3 0.81523901 <a title="224-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Theory_of_Refractive_Photo-Light-Path_Triangulation.html">27 cvpr-2013-A Theory of Refractive Photo-Light-Path Triangulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Visesh Chari, Peter Sturm</p><p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction of transparent refractive objects like a plastic bottle is challenging: they lack appearance related visual cues and merely reflect and refract light from the surrounding environment. Amongst several approaches to reconstruct such objects, the seminal work of Light-Path triangulation [17] is highly popular because of its general applicability and analysis of minimal scenarios. A lightpath is defined as the piece-wise linear path taken by a ray of light as it passes from source, through the object and into the camera. Transparent refractive objects not only affect the geometric configuration of light-paths but also their radiometric properties. In this paper, we describe a method that combines both geometric and radiometric information to do reconstruction. We show two major consequences of the addition of radiometric cues to the light-path setup. Firstly, we extend the case of scenarios in which reconstruction is plausible while reducing the minimal re- quirements for a unique reconstruction. This happens as a consequence of the fact that radiometric cues add an additional known variable to the already existing system of equations. Secondly, we present a simple algorithm for reconstruction, owing to the nature of the radiometric cue. We present several synthetic experiments to validate our theories, and show high quality reconstructions in challenging scenarios.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.80190194 <a title="224-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Information_Consensus_for_Distributed_Multi-target_Tracking.html">224 cvpr-2013-Information Consensus for Distributed Multi-target Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Wei Li, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach for matching images observed in different camera views with complex cross-view transforms and apply it to person reidentification. It jointly partitions the image spaces of two camera views into different configurations according to the similarity of cross-view transforms. The visual features of an image pair from different views are first locally aligned by being projected to a common feature space and then matched with softly assigned metrics which are locally optimized. The features optimal for recognizing identities are different from those for clustering cross-view transforms. They are jointly learned by utilizing sparsityinducing norm and information theoretical regularization. . cuhk . edu .hk (a) Camera view A (b) Camera view B This approach can be generalized to the settings where test images are from new camera views, not the same as those in the training set.

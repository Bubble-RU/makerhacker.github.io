<p>Author: Yang Yang, Guang Shu, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to boost the performance of generic object detectors on videos by learning videospecific features using a deep neural network. The insight behind our proposed approach is that an object appearing in different frames of a video clip should share similar features, which can be learned to build better detectors. Unlike many supervised detector adaptation or detection-bytracking methods, our method does not require any extra annotations or utilize temporal correspondence. We start with the high-confidence detections from a generic detector, then iteratively learn new video-specific features and refine the detection scores. In order to learn discriminative and compact features, we propose a new feature learning method using a deep neural network based on auto encoders. It differs from the existing unsupervised feature learning methods in two ways: first it optimizes both discriminative and generative properties of the features simultaneously, which gives our features better discriminative ability; second, our learned features are more compact, while the unsupervised feature learning methods usually learn a redundant set of over-complete features. Extensive experimental results on person and horse detection show that significant performance improvement can be achieved with our proposed method.</p><p>3 0.22801775 <a title="142-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Self-Paced_Learning_for_Long-Term_Tracking.html">386 cvpr-2013-Self-Paced Learning for Long-Term Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: unkown-author</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of long-term object tracking, where the object may become occluded or leave-the-view. In this setting, we show that an accurate appearance model is considerably more effective than a strong motion model. We develop simple but effective algorithms that alternate between tracking and learning a good appearance model given a track. We show that it is crucial to learn from the “right” frames, and use the formalism of self-paced curriculum learning to automatically select such frames. We leverage techniques from object detection for learning accurate appearance-based templates, demonstrating the importance of using a large negative training set (typically not used for tracking). We describe both an offline algorithm (that processes frames in batch) and a linear-time online (i.e. causal) algorithm that approaches real-time performance. Our models significantly outperform prior art, reducing the average error on benchmark videos by a factor of 4.</p><p>4 0.19360404 <a title="142-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Online_Object_Tracking%3A_A_Benchmark.html">314 cvpr-2013-Online Object Tracking: A Benchmark</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Wu, Jongwoo Lim, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Object tracking is one of the most important components in numerous applications of computer vision. While much progress has been made in recent years with efforts on sharing code and datasets, it is of great importance to develop a library and benchmark to gauge the state of the art. After briefly reviewing recent advances of online object tracking, we carry out large scale experiments with various evaluation criteria to understand how these algorithms perform. The test image sequences are annotated with different attributes for performance evaluation and analysis. By analyzing quantitative results, we identify effective approaches for robust tracking and provide potential future research directions in this field.</p><p>5 0.17761996 <a title="142-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Online_Robust_Dictionary_Learning.html">315 cvpr-2013-Online Robust Dictionary Learning</a></p>

It, however, faces the major difficulty to incorporate robust functions, rather than the square data fitting term, to handle outliers in training data.

<p>Author: Rui Yao, Qinfeng Shi, Chunhua Shen, Yanning Zhang, Anton van_den_Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Despite many advances made in the area, deformable targets and partial occlusions continue to represent key problems in visual tracking. Structured learning has shown good results when applied to tracking whole targets, but applying this approach to a part-based target model is complicated by the need to model the relationships between parts, and to avoid lengthy initialisation processes. We thus propose a method which models the unknown parts using latent variables. In doing so we extend the online algorithm pegasos to the structured prediction case (i.e., predicting the location of the bounding boxes) with latent part variables. To better estimate the parts, and to avoid over-fitting caused by the extra model complexity/capacity introduced by theparts, wepropose a two-stage trainingprocess, based on the primal rather than the dual form. We then show that the method outperforms the state-of-the-art (linear and non-linear kernel) trackers.</p><p>3 0.81943244 <a title="142-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Self-Paced_Learning_for_Long-Term_Tracking.html">386 cvpr-2013-Self-Paced Learning for Long-Term Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Ian Endres, Kevin J. Shih, Johnston Jiaa, Derek Hoiem</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to learn a diverse collection of discriminative parts from object bounding box annotations. Part detectors can be trained and applied individually, which simplifies learning and extension to new features or categories. We apply the parts to object category detection, pooling part detections within bottom-up proposed regions and using a boosted classifier with proposed sigmoid weak learners for scoring. On PASCAL VOC 2010, we evaluate the part detectors ’ ability to discriminate and localize annotated keypoints. Our detection system is competitive with the best-existing systems, outperforming other HOG-based detectors on the more deformable categories.</p><p>6 0.74893737 <a title="142-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Compact_Binary_Codes_for_Visual_Tracking.html">249 cvpr-2013-Learning Compact Binary Codes for Visual Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Raffay Hamid, Dennis Decoste, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present a robust and efficient technique for matching dense sets of points undergoing non-rigid spatial transformations. Our main intuition is that the subset of points that can be matched with high confidence should be used to guide the matching procedure for the rest. We propose a novel algorithm that incorporates these high-confidence matches as a spatial prior to learn a discriminative subspace that simultaneously encodes both the feature similarity as well as their spatial arrangement. Conventional subspace learning usually requires spectral decomposition of the pair-wise distance matrix across the point-sets, which can become inefficient even for moderately sized problems. To this end, we propose the use of random projections for approximate subspace learning, which can provide significant time improvements at the cost of minimal precision loss. This efficiency gain allows us to iteratively find and remove high-confidence matches from the point sets, resulting in high recall. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we present a systematic set of experiments and results for the problem of dense non-rigid image-feature matching.</p><p>2 0.9449656 <a title="142-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Re-ranking_of_Diverse_Segmentations.html">132 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Re-ranking of Diverse Segmentations</a></p>
<p>Author: Payman Yadollahpour, Dhruv Batra, Gregory Shakhnarovich</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a two-stage approach to semantic image segmentation. In the first stage a probabilistic model generates a set of diverse plausible segmentations. In the second stage, a discriminatively trained re-ranking model selects the best segmentation from this set. The re-ranking stage can use much more complex features than what could be tractably used in the probabilistic model, allowing a better exploration of the solution space than possible by simply producing the most probable solution from the probabilistic model. While our proposed approach already achieves state-of-the-art results (48.1%) on the challenging VOC 2012 dataset, our machine and human analyses suggest that even larger gains are possible with such an approach.</p><p>3 0.93090314 <a title="142-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-GeoF%3A_Geodesic_Forests_for_Learning_Coupled_Predictors.html">186 cvpr-2013-GeoF: Geodesic Forests for Learning Coupled Predictors</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Kontschieder, Pushmeet Kohli, Jamie Shotton, Antonio Criminisi</p><p>Abstract: Conventional decision forest based methods for image labelling tasks like object segmentation make predictions for each variable (pixel) independently [3, 5, 8]. This prevents them from enforcing dependencies between variables and translates into locally inconsistent pixel labellings. Random field models, instead, encourage spatial consistency of labels at increased computational expense. This paper presents a new and efficient forest based model that achieves spatially consistent semantic image segmentation by encoding variable dependencies directly in the feature space the forests operate on. Such correlations are captured via new long-range, soft connectivity features, computed via generalized geodesic distance transforms. Our model can be thought of as a generalization of the successful Semantic Texton Forest, Auto-Context, and Entangled Forest models. A second contribution is to show the connection between the typical Conditional Random Field (CRF) energy and the forest training objective. This analysis yields a new objective for training decision forests that encourages more accurate structured prediction. Our GeoF model is validated quantitatively on the task of semantic image segmentation, on four challenging and very diverse image datasets. GeoF outperforms both stateof-the-art forest models and the conventional pairwise CRF.</p><p>4 0.92259103 <a title="142-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Cumulative_Attribute_Space_for_Age_and_Crowd_Density_Estimation.html">101 cvpr-2013-Cumulative Attribute Space for Age and Crowd Density Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Chen, Shaogang Gong, Tao Xiang, Chen Change Loy</p><p>Abstract: A number of computer vision problems such as human age estimation, crowd density estimation and body/face pose (view angle) estimation can be formulated as a regression problem by learning a mapping function between a high dimensional vector-formed feature input and a scalarvalued output. Such a learning problem is made difficult due to sparse and imbalanced training data and large feature variations caused by both uncertain viewing conditions and intrinsic ambiguities between observable visual features and the scalar values to be estimated. Encouraged by the recent success in using attributes for solving classification problems with sparse training data, this paper introduces a novel cumulative attribute concept for learning a regression model when only sparse and imbalanced data are available. More precisely, low-level visual features extracted from sparse and imbalanced image samples are mapped onto a cumulative attribute space where each dimension has clearly defined semantic interpretation (a label) that captures how the scalar output value (e.g. age, people count) changes continuously and cumulatively. Extensive experiments show that our cumulative attribute framework gains notable advantage on accuracy for both age estimation and crowd counting when compared against conventional regression models, especially when the labelled training data is sparse with imbalanced sampling.</p><p>5 0.91382533 <a title="142-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Augmenting_Bag-of-Words%3A_Data-Driven_Discovery_of_Temporal_and_Structural_Information_for_Activity_Recognition.html">49 cvpr-2013-Augmenting Bag-of-Words: Data-Driven Discovery of Temporal and Structural Information for Activity Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Vinay Bettadapura, Grant Schindler, Thomas Ploetz, Irfan Essa</p><p>Abstract: We present data-driven techniques to augment Bag of Words (BoW) models, which allow for more robust modeling and recognition of complex long-term activities, especially when the structure and topology of the activities are not known a priori. Our approach specifically addresses the limitations of standard BoW approaches, which fail to represent the underlying temporal and causal information that is inherent in activity streams. In addition, we also propose the use ofrandomly sampled regular expressions to discover and encode patterns in activities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in experimental evaluations where we successfully recognize activities and detect anomalies in four complex datasets.</p><p>6 0.9122541 <a title="142-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Crossing_the_Line%3A_Crowd_Counting_by_Integer_Programming_with_Local_Features.html">100 cvpr-2013-Crossing the Line: Crowd Counting by Integer Programming with Local Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Kaiming He, Fang Wen, Jian Sun</p><p>Abstract: In computer vision there has been increasing interest in learning hashing codes whose Hamming distance approximates the data similarity. The hashing functions play roles in both quantizing the vector space and generating similarity-preserving codes. Most existing hashing methods use hyper-planes (or kernelized hyper-planes) to quantize and encode. In this paper, we present a hashing method adopting the k-means quantization. We propose a novel Affinity-Preserving K-means algorithm which simultaneously performs k-means clustering and learns the binary indices of the quantized cells. The distance between the cells is approximated by the Hamming distance of the cell indices. We further generalize our algorithm to a product space for learning longer codes.

<p>Author: Fumin Shen, Chunhua Shen, Qinfeng Shi, Anton van_den_Hengel, Zhenmin Tang</p><p>Abstract: Learning based hashing methods have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may operate. Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes that preserve the Euclidean distance in the original space. Manifold learning techniques, in contrast, are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the original highdimensional data. The complexity of these models, and the problems with out-of-sample data, havepreviously rendered them unsuitable for application to large-scale embedding, however. In this work, we consider how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds. In order to address the above-mentioned difficulties, we describe an efficient, inductive solution to the out-of-sample data problem, and a process by which non-parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method. Our proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available. We particularly show that hashing on the basis of t-SNE [29] outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods on large-scale benchmark datasets, and is very effective for image classification with very short code lengths.</p><p>4 0.60138655 <a title="63-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Compressed_Hashing.html">87 cvpr-2013-Compressed Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Lin, Rong Jin, Deng Cai, Shuicheng Yan, Xuelong Li</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that hashing methods are effective for high dimensional nearest neighbor search. A common problem shared by many existing hashing methods is that in order to achieve a satisfied performance, a large number of hash tables (i.e., long codewords) are required. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel approach called Compressed Hashing by exploring the techniques of sparse coding and compressed sensing. In particular, we introduce a sparse coding scheme, based on the approximation theory of integral operator, that generate sparse representation for high dimensional vectors. We then project sparse codes into a low dimensional space by effectively exploring the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), a key property in compressed sensing theory. Both of the theoretical analysis and the empirical studies on two large data sets show that the proposed approach is more effective than the state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.</p><p>5 0.54604125 <a title="63-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast%2C_Accurate_Detection_of_100%2C000_Object_Classes_on_a_Single_Machine.html">163 cvpr-2013-Fast, Accurate Detection of 100,000 Object Classes on a Single Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Dean, Mark A. Ruzon, Mark Segal, Jonathon Shlens, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Jay Yagnik</p><p>Abstract: Many object detection systems are constrained by the time required to convolve a target image with a bank of filters that code for different aspects of an object’s appearance, such as the presence of component parts. We exploit locality-sensitive hashing to replace the dot-product kernel operator in the convolution with a fixed number of hash-table probes that effectively sample all of the filter responses in time independent of the size of the filter bank. To show the effectiveness of the technique, we apply it to evaluate 100,000 deformable-part models requiring over a million (part) filters on multiple scales of a target image in less than 20 seconds using a single multi-core processor with 20GB of RAM. This represents a speed-up of approximately 20,000 times— four orders of magnitude— when compared withperforming the convolutions explicitly on the same hardware. While mean average precision over the full set of 100,000 object classes is around 0.16 due in large part to the challenges in gathering training data and collecting ground truth for so many classes, we achieve a mAP of at least 0.20 on a third of the classes and 0.30 or better on about 20% of the classes.</p><p>6 0.37992519 <a title="63-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_Compact_Binary_Codes_for_Visual_Tracking.html">249 cvpr-2013-Learning Compact Binary Codes for Visual Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: unkown-author</p><p>Abstract: The objective of this paper is large scale object instance retrieval, given a query image. A starting point of such systems is feature detection and description, for example using SIFT. The focus of this paper, however, is towards very large scale retrieval where, due to storage requirements, very compact image descriptors are required and no information about the original SIFT descriptors can be accessed directly at run time. We start from VLAD, the state-of-the art compact descriptor introduced by J´ egou et al. [8] for this purpose, and make three novel contributions: first, we show that a simple change to the normalization method significantly improves retrieval performance; second, we show that vocabulary adaptation can substantially alleviate problems caused when images are added to the dataset after initial vocabulary learning. These two methods set a new stateof-the-art over all benchmarks investigated here for both mid-dimensional (20k-D to 30k-D) and small (128-D) descriptors. Our third contribution is a multiple spatial VLAD representation, MultiVLAD, that allows the retrieval and local- ization of objects that only extend over a small part of an image (again without requiring use of the original image SIFT descriptors).</p><p>3 0.73276258 <a title="63-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Compressed_Hashing.html">87 cvpr-2013-Compressed Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Lin, Rong Jin, Deng Cai, Shuicheng Yan, Xuelong Li</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that hashing methods are effective for high dimensional nearest neighbor search. A common problem shared by many existing hashing methods is that in order to achieve a satisfied performance, a large number of hash tables (i.e., long codewords) are required. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel approach called Compressed Hashing by exploring the techniques of sparse coding and compressed sensing. In particular, we introduce a sparse coding scheme, based on the approximation theory of integral operator, that generate sparse representation for high dimensional vectors. We then project sparse codes into a low dimensional space by effectively exploring the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), a key property in compressed sensing theory. Both of the theoretical analysis and the empirical studies on two large data sets show that the proposed approach is more effective than the state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.</p><p>4 0.72671831 <a title="63-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Social_Role_Discovery_in_Human_Events.html">402 cvpr-2013-Social Role Discovery in Human Events</a></p>
<p>Author: Vignesh Ramanathan, Bangpeng Yao, Li Fei-Fei</p><p>Abstract: We deal with the problem of recognizing social roles played by people in an event. Social roles are governed by human interactions, and form a fundamental component of human event description. We focus on a weakly supervised setting, where we are provided different videos belonging to an event class, without training role labels. Since social roles are described by the interaction between people in an event, we propose a Conditional Random Field to model the inter-role interactions, along with person specific social descriptors. We develop tractable variational inference to simultaneously infer model weights, as well as role assignment to all people in the videos. We also present a novel YouTube social roles dataset with ground truth role annotations, and introduce annotations on a subset of videos from the TRECVID-MED11 [1] event kits for evaluation purposes. The performance of the model is compared against different baseline methods on these datasets.</p><p>5 0.71841991 <a title="63-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Dictionary_Learning_from_Ambiguously_Labeled_Data.html">125 cvpr-2013-Dictionary Learning from Ambiguously Labeled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi-Chen Chen, Vishal M. Patel, Jaishanker K. Pillai, Rama Chellappa, P. Jonathon Phillips</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel dictionary-based learning method for ambiguously labeled multiclass classification, where each training sample has multiple labels and only one of them is the correct label. The dictionary learning problem is solved using an iterative alternating algorithm. At each iteration of the algorithm, two alternating steps are performed: a confidence update and a dictionary update. The confidence of each sample is defined as the probability distribution on its ambiguous labels. The dictionaries are updated using either soft (EM-based) or hard decision rules. Extensive evaluations on existing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs significantly better than state-of-the-art ambiguously labeled learning approaches.</p><p>6 0.71291703 <a title="63-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_2D-to-3D_Correspondence_Filtering_for_Scalable_3D_Object_Recognition.html">138 cvpr-2013-Efficient 2D-to-3D Correspondence Filtering for Scalable 3D Object Recognition</a></p>

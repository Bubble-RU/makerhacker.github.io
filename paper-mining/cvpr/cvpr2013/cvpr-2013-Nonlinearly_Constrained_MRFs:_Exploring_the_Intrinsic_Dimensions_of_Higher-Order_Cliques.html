<p>Author: Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of performing inference in graphical models whose energy is a polynomial function of continuous variables. Our energy minimization method follows a dual decomposition approach, where the global problem is split into subproblems defined over the graph cliques. The optimal solution to these subproblems is obtained by making use of a polynomial system solver. Our algorithm inherits the convergence guarantees of dual decomposition. To speed up optimization, we also introduce a variant of this algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian method. Our experiments illustrate the diversity of computer vision problems that can be expressed with polynomial energies, and demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing continuous inference methods.</p><p>3 0.1907066 <a title="308-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Whitened_Expectation_Propagation%3A_Non-Lambertian_Shape_from_Shading_and_Shadow.html">466 cvpr-2013-Whitened Expectation Propagation: Non-Lambertian Shape from Shading and Shadow</a></p>
<p>Author: Brian Potetz, Mohammadreza Hajiarbabi</p><p>Abstract: For problems over continuous random variables, MRFs with large cliques pose a challenge in probabilistic inference. Difficulties in performing optimization efficiently have limited the probabilistic models explored in computer vision and other fields. One inference technique that handles large cliques well is Expectation Propagation. EP offers run times independent of clique size, which instead depend only on the rank, or intrinsic dimensionality, of potentials. This property would be highly advantageous in computer vision. Unfortunately, for grid-shaped models common in vision, traditional Gaussian EP requires quadratic space and cubic time in the number of pixels. Here, we propose a variation of EP that exploits regularities in natural scene statistics to achieve run times that are linear in both number of pixels and clique size. We test these methods on shape from shading, and we demonstrate strong performance not only for Lambertian surfaces, but also on arbitrary surface reflectance and lighting arrangements, which requires highly non-Gaussian potentials. Finally, we use large, non-local cliques to exploit cast shadow, which is traditionally ignored in shape from shading.</p><p>4 0.13375954 <a title="308-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_Large-Scale_Structured_Learning.html">143 cvpr-2013-Efficient Large-Scale Structured Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jan D. Wegner, Javier A. Montoya-Zegarra, Konrad Schindler</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to extract the road network from aerial images. What makes the problem challenging is the complex structure of the prior: roads form a connected network of smooth, thin segments which meet at junctions and crossings. This type of a-priori knowledge is more difficult to turn into a tractable model than standard smoothness or co-occurrence assumptions. We develop a novel CRF formulation for road labeling, in which the prior is represented by higher-order cliques that connect sets of superpixels along straight line segments. These long-range cliques have asymmetric PN-potentials, which express a preference to assign all rather than just some of their constituent superpixels to the road class. Thus, the road likelihood is amplified for thin chains of superpixels, while the CRF is still amenable to optimization with graph cuts. Since the number of such cliques of arbitrary length is huge, we furthermorepropose a sampling scheme which concentrates on those cliques which are most relevant for the optimization. In experiments on two different databases the model significantly improves both the per-pixel accuracy and the topological correctness of the extracted roads, and outper- forms both a simple smoothness prior and heuristic rulebased road completion.</p><p>6 0.12870158 <a title="308-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Efficient_and_Exact_MAP-Inference_for_Large_Scale_Discrete_Computer_Vision_Problems_via_Combinatorial_Optimization.html">436 cvpr-2013-Towards Efficient and Exact MAP-Inference for Large Scale Discrete Computer Vision Problems via Combinatorial Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Jörg Hendrik Kappes, Markus Speth, Gerhard Reinelt, Christoph Schnörr</p><p>Abstract: Discrete graphical models (also known as discrete Markov random fields) are a major conceptual tool to model the structure of optimization problems in computer vision. While in the last decade research has focused on fast approximative methods, algorithms that provide globally optimal solutions have come more into the research focus in the last years. However, large scale computer vision problems seemed to be out of reach for such methods. In this paper we introduce a promising way to bridge this gap based on partial optimality and structural properties of the underlying problem factorization. Combining these preprocessing steps, we are able to solve grids of size 2048 2048 in less than 90 seconds. On the hitherto unsolva2b04le8 C×h2i0ne4s8e character dataset of Nowozin et al. we obtain provably optimal results in 56% of the instances and achieve competitive runtimes on other recent benchmark problems. While in the present work only generalized Potts models are considered, an extension to general graphical models seems to be feasible.</p><p>4 0.76478881 <a title="308-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Universality_of_the_Local_Marginal_Polytope.html">448 cvpr-2013-Universality of the Local Marginal Polytope</a></p>
<p>Author: unkown-author</p><p>Abstract: We show that solving the LP relaxation of the MAP inference problem in graphical models (also known as the minsum problem, energy minimization, or weighted constraint satisfaction) is not easier than solving any LP. More precisely, any polytope is linear-time representable by a local marginal polytope and any LP can be reduced in linear time to a linear optimization (allowing infinite weights) over a local marginal polytope.</p><p>5 0.72709054 <a title="308-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Whitened_Expectation_Propagation%3A_Non-Lambertian_Shape_from_Shading_and_Shadow.html">466 cvpr-2013-Whitened Expectation Propagation: Non-Lambertian Shape from Shading and Shadow</a></p>

<p>Author: Jianchao Yang, Zhe Lin, Scott Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a fast regression model for practical single image super-resolution based on in-place examples, by leveraging two fundamental super-resolution approaches— learning from an external database and learning from selfexamples. Our in-place self-similarity refines the recently proposed local self-similarity by proving that a patch in the upper scale image have good matches around its origin location in the lower scale image. Based on the in-place examples, a first-order approximation of the nonlinear mapping function from low- to high-resolution image patches is learned. Extensive experiments on benchmark and realworld images demonstrate that our algorithm can produce natural-looking results with sharp edges and preserved fine details, while the current state-of-the-art algorithms are prone to visual artifacts. Furthermore, our model can easily extend to deal with noise by combining the regression results on multiple in-place examples for robust estimation. The algorithm runs fast and is particularly useful for practical applications, where the input images typically contain diverse textures and they are potentially contaminated by noise or compression artifacts.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.90958214 <a title="308-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Nonlinearly_Constrained_MRFs%3A_Exploring_the_Intrinsic_Dimensions_of_Higher-Order_Cliques.html">308 cvpr-2013-Nonlinearly Constrained MRFs: Exploring the Intrinsic Dimensions of Higher-Order Cliques</a></p>

Conventional context models mainly focus on learning pairwise relationships between objects. Pairwise relations, however, are not enough to represent high-level contextual knowledge within images. In this paper, we propose semantic relation transfer, a method to transfer high-order semantic relations of objects from annotated images to unlabeled images analogous to label transfer techniques where label information are transferred. Wefirst define semantic tensors representing high-order relations of objects. Semantic relation transfer problem is then formulated as semi-supervised learning using a quadratic objective function of the semantic tensors. By exploiting low-rank property of the semantic tensors and employing Kronecker sum similarity, an efficient approximation algorithm is developed. Based on the predicted high-order semantic relations, we reason semantic segmentation and evaluate the performance on several challenging datasets.</p><p>4 0.87069863 <a title="308-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Object_Co-detection.html">364 cvpr-2013-Robust Object Co-detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xin Guo, Dong Liu, Brendan Jou, Mojun Zhu, Anni Cai, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Object co-detection aims at simultaneous detection of objects of the same category from a pool of related images by exploiting consistent visual patterns present in candidate objects in the images. The related image set may contain a mixture of annotated objects and candidate objects generated by automatic detectors. Co-detection differs from the conventional object detection paradigm in which detection over each test image is determined one-by-one independently without taking advantage of common patterns in the data pool. In this paper, we propose a novel, robust approach to dramatically enhance co-detection by extracting a shared low-rank representation of the object instances in multiple feature spaces. The idea is analogous to that of the well-known Robust PCA [28], but has not been explored in object co-detection so far. The representation is based on a linear reconstruction over the entire data set and the low-rank approach enables effective removal of noisy and outlier samples. The extracted low-rank representation can be used to detect the target objects by spectral clustering. Extensive experiments over diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art object codetection method and the generic object detection methods without co-detection formulations.</p><p>5 0.86346757 <a title="308-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Improved_Image_Set_Classification_via_Joint_Sparse_Approximated_Nearest_Subspaces.html">215 cvpr-2013-Improved Image Set Classification via Joint Sparse Approximated Nearest Subspaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Shaokang Chen, Conrad Sanderson, Mehrtash T. Harandi, Brian C. Lovell</p><p>Abstract: Existing multi-model approaches for image set classification extract local models by clustering each image set individually only once, with fixed clusters used for matching with other image sets. However, this may result in the two closest clusters to represent different characteristics of an object, due to different undesirable environmental conditions (such as variations in illumination and pose). To address this problem, we propose to constrain the clustering of each query image set by forcing the clusters to have resemblance to the clusters in the gallery image sets. We first define a Frobenius norm distance between subspaces over Grassmann manifolds based on reconstruction error. We then extract local linear subspaces from a gallery image set via sparse representation. For each local linear subspace, we adaptively construct the corresponding closest subspace from the samples of a probe image set by joint sparse representation. We show that by minimising the sparse representation reconstruction error, we approach the nearest point on a Grassmann manifold. Experiments on Honda, ETH-80 and Cambridge-Gesture datasets show that the proposed method consistently outperforms several other recent techniques, such as Affine Hull based Image Set Distance (AHISD), Sparse Approximated Nearest Points (SANP) and Manifold Discriminant Analysis (MDA).</p><p>6 0.85825145 <a title="308-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Adding_Unlabeled_Samples_to_Categories_by_Learned_Attributes.html">36 cvpr-2013-Adding Unlabeled Samples to Categories by Learned Attributes</a></p>

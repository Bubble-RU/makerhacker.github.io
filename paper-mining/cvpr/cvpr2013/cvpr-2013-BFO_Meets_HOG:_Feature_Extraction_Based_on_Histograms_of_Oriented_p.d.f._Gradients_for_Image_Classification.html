<p>Author: Amirreza Shaban, Hamid R. Rabiee, Mehrdad Farajtabar, Marjan Ghazvininejad</p><p>Abstract: Bag of words models for feature extraction have demonstrated top-notch performance in image classification. These representations are usually accompanied by a coding method. Recently, methods that code a descriptor giving regard to its nearby bases have proved efficacious. These methods take into account the nonlinear structure of descriptors, since local similarities are a good approximation of global similarities. However, they confine their usage of the global similarities to nearby bases. In this paper, we propose a coding scheme that brings into focus the manifold structure of descriptors, and devise a method to compute the global similarities of descriptors to the bases. Given a local similarity measure between bases, a global measure is computed. Exploiting the local similarity of a descriptor and its nearby bases, a global measure of association of a descriptor to all the bases is computed. Unlike the locality-based and sparse coding methods, the proposed coding varies smoothly with respect to the underlying manifold. Experiments on benchmark image classification datasets substantiate the superiority oftheproposed method over its locality and sparsity based rivals.</p><p>3 0.15644141 <a title="53-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Expanded_Parts_Model_for_Human_Attribute_and_Action_Recognition_in_Still_Images.html">153 cvpr-2013-Expanded Parts Model for Human Attribute and Action Recognition in Still Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Gaurav Sharma, Frédéric Jurie, Cordelia Schmid</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new model for recognizing human attributes (e.g. wearing a suit, sitting, short hair) and actions (e.g. running, riding a horse) in still images. The proposed model relies on a collection of part templates which are learnt discriminatively to explain specific scale-space locations in the images (in human centric coordinates). It avoids the limitations of highly structured models, which consist of a few (i.e. a mixture of) ‘average ’ templates. To learn our model, we propose an algorithm which automatically mines out parts and learns corresponding discriminative templates with their respective locations from a large number of candidate parts. We validate the method on recent challenging datasets: (i) Willow 7 actions [7], (ii) 27 Human Attributes (HAT) [25], and (iii) Stanford 40 actions [37]. We obtain convincing qualitative and state-of-the-art quantitative results on the three datasets.</p><p>4 0.13895023 <a title="53-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Bayesian_Approach_to_Multimodal_Visual_Dictionary_Learning.html">5 cvpr-2013-A Bayesian Approach to Multimodal Visual Dictionary Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Go Irie, Dong Liu, Zhenguo Li, Shih-Fu Chang</p><p>Abstract: Despite significant progress, most existing visual dictionary learning methods rely on image descriptors alone or together with class labels. However, Web images are often associated with text data which may carry substantial information regarding image semantics, and may be exploited for visual dictionary learning. This paper explores this idea by leveraging relational information between image descriptors and textual words via co-clustering, in addition to information of image descriptors. Existing co-clustering methods are not optimal for this problem because they ignore the structure of image descriptors in the continuous space, which is crucial for capturing visual characteristics of images. We propose a novel Bayesian co-clustering model to jointly estimate the underlying distributions of the continuous image descriptors as well as the relationship between such distributions and the textual words through a unified Bayesian inference. Extensive experiments on image categorization and retrieval have validated the substantial value of the proposed joint modeling in improving visual dictionary learning, where our model shows superior performance over several recent methods.</p><p>5 0.13763246 <a title="53-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Harvesting_Mid-level_Visual_Concepts_from_Large-Scale_Internet_Images.html">200 cvpr-2013-Harvesting Mid-level Visual Concepts from Large-Scale Internet Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Quannan Li, Jiajun Wu, Zhuowen Tu</p><p>Abstract: Obtaining effective mid-level representations has become an increasingly important task in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic algorithm which harvests visual concepts from a large number of Internet images (more than a quarter of a million) using text-based queries. Existing approaches to visual concept learning from Internet images either rely on strong supervision with detailed manual annotations or learn image-level classifiers only. Here, we take the advantage of having massive wellorganized Google and Bing image data; visual concepts (around 14, 000) are automatically exploited from images using word-based queries. Using the learned visual concepts, we show state-of-the-art performances on a variety of benchmark datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned mid-level representations: being able to generalize well to general natural images. Our method shows significant improvement over the competing systems in image classification, including those with strong supervision.</p><p>6 0.12148369 <a title="53-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Visual_Place_Recognition_with_Repetitive_Structures.html">456 cvpr-2013-Visual Place Recognition with Repetitive Structures</a></p>

<p>Author: Liang Zheng, Shengjin Wang, Ziqiong Liu, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: The Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is prevalently utilized in the Bag-of-Words based image search. The basic idea is to assign less weight to terms with high frequency, and vice versa. However, the estimation of visual word frequency is coarse and heuristic. Therefore, the effectiveness of the conventional IDF routine is marginal, and far from optimal. To tackle thisproblem, thispaper introduces a novel IDF expression by the use of Lp-norm pooling technique. . edu . cn qit i @ c s an . ut s a . edu ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Carefully designed, the proposed IDF takes into account the term frequency, document frequency, the complexity of images, as well as the codebook information.

Our method is evaluated through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (Oxford 5K, Paris 6K and Flickr 1M). We report a performance improvement of as large as 27.1% over the baseline approach. Moreover, since the Lp-norm IDF is computed offline, no extra computation or memory cost is introduced to the system at all.</p><p>3 0.7485621 <a title="53-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Fast_Approximate_AIB_Algorithm_for_Distributional_Word_Clustering.html">8 cvpr-2013-A Fast Approximate AIB Algorithm for Distributional Word Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Wang, Jianjia Zhang, Luping Zhou, Wanqing Li</p><p>Abstract: Distributional word clustering merges the words having similar probability distributions to attain reliable parameter estimation, compact classification models and even better classification performance. Agglomerative Information Bottleneck (AIB) is one of the typical word clustering algorithms and has been applied to both traditional text classification and recent image recognition. Although enjoying theoretical elegance, AIB has one main issue on its computational efficiency, especially when clustering a large number of words. Different from existing solutions to this issue, we analyze the characteristics of its objective function the loss of mutual information, and show that by merely using the ratio of word-class joint probabilities of each word, good candidate word pairs for merging can be easily identified. Based on this finding, we propose a fast approximate AIB algorithm and show that it can significantly improve the computational efficiency of AIB while well maintaining or even slightly increasing its classification performance. Experimental study on both text and image classification benchmark data sets shows that our algorithm can achieve more than 100 times speedup on large real data sets over the state-of-the-art method.</p><p>4 0.73234683 <a title="53-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-From_Local_Similarity_to_Global_Coding%3A_An_Application_to_Image_Classification.html">178 cvpr-2013-From Local Similarity to Global Coding: An Application to Image Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Liang Li, Wei Feng, Liang Wan, Jiawan Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses a challenging problem of regularizing arbitrary superpixels into an optimal grid structure, which may significantly extend current low-level vision algorithms by allowing them to use superpixels (SPs) conveniently as using pixels. For this purpose, we aim at constructing maximum cohesive SP-grid, which is composed of real nodes, i.e. SPs, and dummy nodes that are meaningless in the image with only position-taking function in the grid. For a given formation of image SPs and proper number of dummy nodes, we first dynamically align them into a grid based on the centroid localities of SPs. We then define the SP-grid coherence as the sum of edge weights, with SP locality and appearance encoded, along all direct paths connecting any two nearest neighboring real nodes in the grid. We finally maximize the SP-grid coherence via cascade dynamic programming. Our approach can take the regional objectness as an optional constraint to produce more semantically reliable SP-grids. Experiments on object localization show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both detection accuracy and speed. We also find that with the same searching strategy and features, object localization at SP-level is about 100-500 times faster than pixel-level, with usually better detection accuracy.</p><p>2 0.93363398 <a title="53-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Relative_Volume_Constraints_for_Single_View_3D_Reconstruction.html">354 cvpr-2013-Relative Volume Constraints for Single View 3D Reconstruction</a></p>
<p>Author: Eno Töppe, Claudia Nieuwenhuis, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the concept of relative volume constraints in order to account for insufficient information in the reconstruction of 3D objects from a single image. The key idea is to formulate a variational reconstruction approach with shape priors in form of relative depth profiles or volume ratios relating object parts. Such shape priors can easily be derived either from a user sketch or from the object’s shading profile in the image. They can handle textured or shadowed object regions by propagating information. We propose a convex relaxation of the constrained optimization problem which can be solved optimally in a few seconds on graphics hardware. In contrast to existing single view reconstruction algorithms, the proposed algorithm provides substantially more flexibility to recover shape details such as self-occlusions, dents and holes, which are not visible in the object silhouette.</p><p>3 0.93211365 <a title="53-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Composite_Statistical_Inference_for_Semantic_Segmentation.html">86 cvpr-2013-Composite Statistical Inference for Semantic Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Fuxin Li, Joao Carreira, Guy Lebanon, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an inference procedure for the semantic segmentation of images. Differentfrom many CRF approaches that rely on dependencies modeled with unary and pairwise pixel or superpixel potentials, our method is entirely based on estimates of the overlap between each of a set of mid-level object segmentation proposals and the objects present in the image. We define continuous latent variables on superpixels obtained by multiple intersections of segments, then output the optimal segments from the inferred superpixel statistics. The algorithm is capable of recombine and refine initial mid-level proposals, as well as handle multiple interacting objects, even from the same class, all in a consistent joint inference framework by maximizing the composite likelihood of the underlying statistical model using an EM algorithm. In the PASCAL VOC segmentation challenge, the proposed approach obtains high accuracy and successfully handles images of complex object interactions.</p><p>4 0.93125999 <a title="53-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Ensemble_Video_Object_Cut_in_Highly_Dynamic_Scenes.html">148 cvpr-2013-Ensemble Video Object Cut in Highly Dynamic Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaobo Ren, Tony X. Han, Zhihai He</p><p>Abstract: We consider video object cut as an ensemble of framelevel background-foreground object classifiers which fuses information across frames and refine their segmentation results in a collaborative and iterative manner. Our approach addresses the challenging issues of modeling of background with dynamic textures and segmentation of foreground objects from cluttered scenes. We construct patch-level bagof-words background models to effectively capture the background motion and texture dynamics. We propose a foreground salience graph (FSG) to characterize the similarity of an image patch to the bag-of-words background models in the temporal domain and to neighboring image patches in the spatial domain. We incorporate this similarity information into a graph-cut energy minimization framework for foreground object segmentation. The background-foreground classification results at neighboring frames are fused together to construct a foreground probability map to update the graph weights. The resulting object shapes at neighboring frames are also used as constraints to guide the energy minimization process during graph cut. Our extensive experimental results and performance comparisons over a diverse set of challenging videos with dynamic scenes, including the new Change Detection Challenge Dataset, demonstrate that the proposed ensemble video object cut method outperforms various state-ofthe-art algorithms.</p><p>5 0.92981482 <a title="53-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Cloud_Motion_as_a_Calibration_Cue.html">84 cvpr-2013-Cloud Motion as a Calibration Cue</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Jacobs, Mohammad T. Islam, Scott Workman</p><p>Abstract: We propose cloud motion as a natural scene cue that enables geometric calibration of static outdoor cameras. This work introduces several new methods that use observations of an outdoor scene over days and weeks to estimate radial distortion, focal length and geo-orientation. Cloud-based cues provide strong constraints and are an important alternative to methods that require specific forms of static scene geometry or clear sky conditions. Our method makes simple assumptions about cloud motion and builds upon previous work on motion-based and line-based calibration. We show results on real scenes that highlight the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p><p>6 0.92933023 <a title="53-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Winding_Number_for_Region-Boundary_Consistent_Salient_Contour_Extraction.html">468 cvpr-2013-Winding Number for Region-Boundary Consistent Salient Contour Extraction</a></p>

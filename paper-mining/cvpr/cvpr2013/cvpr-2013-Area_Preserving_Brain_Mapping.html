</p><p>8 Many prominent approaches, such as conformal mapping [18] and Ricci Flow [20] which have been employed to shape analysis [27, 7] and surface registration [35]. [sent-15, score-0.746]
</p><p>9 The conformal mapping may bring huge area distortions . [sent-17, score-0.775]
</p><p>10 In this work, we propose a novel method to compute area preserving mapping between surfaces. [sent-27, score-0.604]
</p><p>11 We tested our algorithm on cortical and caudate nucleus surfaces extracted from 3D anatomical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. [sent-30, score-0.969]
</p><p>12 Figure 1demonstrates the unique power that the area preserving mapping provides for brain cortical surface visualization when compared with its counterpart conformal mapping result. [sent-31, score-2.08]
</p><p>13 On cortical surfaces, the area preserving may also provide good visualization function to visualize those deeply buried sulci areas which otherwise are usually visualized with big area distortions. [sent-32, score-0.976]
</p><p>14 Comparison The area preserving mapping is based on Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) theory, which has been applied for image registration and warping [19, 26] and visualization [36]. [sent-41, score-0.667]
</p><p>15 Comparison of geometric mappings for a left brain cortical surface: (a) brain cortical surface lateral view; (b) brain cortical surface medial view; brains are color coded according to functional area definition in [11]; (c) conformal mapping result; (d) area preserving mapping result. [sent-44, score-3.42]
</p><p>16 The results show that conformal mapping has much more area distortions on the areas close to the boundary while the area preserving mapping provides a map which preserves the area everywhere. [sent-45, score-1.633]
</p><p>17 Consider a diffeomorphism f : Ω0 → Ω1, which is mass  preservation  μ0 =  |Jf|μ1 ◦ f  where Jfis the Jacobian ofthe mapping f. [sent-50, score-0.398]
</p><p>18 An optimal mass transport map, when it exists, minimizes the mass transport cost. [sent-53, score-0.703]
</p><p>19 There are two different approaches to prove the existence of the optimal mass transport map, i. [sent-54, score-0.364]
</p><p>20 (1)  (2)  In contrast, Brenier showed there exists a convex function  ×  u : Ω0 → R, such that its gradient map ∇u gives the optimal mass transport map, asn gdr preserves pth ∇e mass: μ0 = det|H(u) |μ1 ◦ ∇u. [sent-63, score-0.449]
</p><p>21 In our current method, we only discretize the target domain Ω1 to n points, then determine n power weights for them, so that the power Voronoi diagram induced by the points and their power weights gives the optimal mass transport map. [sent-69, score-0.953]
</p><p>22 Furthermore, the obtained area preserving mapping between two surfaces is solely determined by the surface Riemannian metric, therefore it is intrinsic. [sent-81, score-0.827]
</p><p>23 Contributions Our major contributions in this work include: a way to compute area preserving mapping between surfaces based on Brenier’s approach in Optimal Mass Transport theory. [sent-84, score-0.679]
</p><p>24 Thus our method offers a stable way to calculate area preserving mapping in 2D parametric coordinates. [sent-87, score-0.604]
</p><p>25 To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to compute area preserving mapping between surfaces based on Brenier’s approach in OMT and apply it to map the profile of differences in surface morphology between healthy control subjects and AD patients. [sent-88, score-1.052]
</p><p>26 Our experimental results show our work may provide novel ways for shape analysis and improve the statistical detection power for detecting abnormalities in brain surface morphology. [sent-89, score-0.578]

</p><p>61 Figure 2 (b) shows that most parts of conformal mapping result shrink towards the center, while the area preserving method shown in Figure 2 (c) gives a good mapping, keeping the same area element, without much numerical error. [sent-257, score-1.097]

</p><p>81 The results show that the conformal mapping results have much more area distortion  on the areas close to the boundary while the area preserving mapping provides a map which preserves the area of each individual functional area. [sent-305, score-1.689]
</p><p>82 The area preserving mapping has a potential to better visualize certain sulci areas which are deeply buried under gyri, and hence to provide a tool for a more accurate manual landmark delineation operation. [sent-306, score-0.764]

<p>Author: Rui Shi, Wei Zeng, Zhengyu Su, Hanna Damasio, Zhonglin Lu, Yalin Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Xianfeng Gu</p><p>Abstract: Automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is an active research field in computer vision, computer graphics and computational geometry. It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquer this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric, so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints.

<p>Author: Luping Zhou, Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu, Philip Ogunbona, Dinggang Shen</p><p>Abstract: Analyzing brain networks from neuroimages is becoming a promising approach in identifying novel connectivitybased biomarkers for the Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this regard, brain “effective connectivity ” analysis, which studies the causal relationship among brain regions, is highly challenging and of many research opportunities. Most of the existing works in this field use generative methods. Despite their success in data representation and other important merits, generative methods are not necessarily discriminative, which may cause the ignorance of subtle but critical disease-induced changes. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach that integrates the benefits of generative and discriminative methods to recover effective connectivity. In particular, we employ Fisher kernel to bridge the generative models of sparse Bayesian networks (SBN) and the discriminative classifiers of SVMs, and convert the SBN parameter learning to Fisher kernel learning via minimizing a generalization error bound of SVMs. Our method is able to simultaneously boost the discriminative power of both the generative SBN models and the SBN-induced SVM classifiers via Fisher kernel. The proposed method is tested on analyzing brain effective connectivity for AD from ADNI data, and demonstrates significant improvements over the state-of-the-art work.</p><p>4 0.17214312 <a title="44-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Monocular_Template-Based_3D_Reconstruction_of_Extensible_Surfaces_with_Local_Linear_Elasticity.html">289 cvpr-2013-Monocular Template-Based 3D Reconstruction of Extensible Surfaces with Local Linear Elasticity</a></p>

We extend the method of isometric surface reconstruction and more recent work on conformal surface reconstruction. Our approach relies on the minimization of a proposed stretching energy formalized with respect to the Poisson ratio parameter of the surface. We derive a patch-based formulation of this stretching energy by assuming local linear elasticity. This formulation unifies geometrical and mechanical constraints in a single energy term. We prevent local scale ambiguities by imposing a set of fixed boundary 3D points. We experimentally prove the sufficiency of this set of boundary points and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different developable and non-developable surfaces with a wide range of extensibility.</p><p>5 0.14969787 <a title="44-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution_Shape_Analysis_via_Non-Euclidean_Wavelets%3A_Applications_to_Mesh_Segmentation_and_Surface_Alignment_Problems.html">297 cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution Shape Analysis via Non-Euclidean Wavelets: Applications to Mesh Segmentation and Surface Alignment Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Won Hwa Kim, Moo K. Chung, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The analysis of 3-D shape meshes is a fundamental problem in computer vision, graphics, and medical imaging. Frequently, the needs of the application require that our analysis take a multi-resolution view of the shape ’s local and global topology, and that the solution is consistent across multiple scales. Unfortunately, the preferred mathematical construct which offers this behavior in classical image/signal processing, Wavelets, is no longer applicable in this general setting (data with non-uniform topology). In particular, the traditional definition does not allow writing out an expansion for graphs that do not correspond to the uniformly sampled lattice (e.g., images). In this paper, we adapt recent results in harmonic analysis, to derive NonEuclidean Wavelets based algorithms for a range of shape analysis problems in vision and medical imaging. We show how descriptors derived from the dual domain representation offer native multi-resolution behavior for characterizing local/global topology around vertices. With only minor modifications, the framework yields a method for extracting interest/key points from shapes, a surprisingly simple algorithm for 3-D shape segmentation (competitive with state of the art), and a method for surface alignment (without landmarks). We give an extensive set of comparison results on a large shape segmentation benchmark and derive a uniqueness theorem for the surface alignment problem.</p><p>6 0.096071079 <a title="44-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Intrinsic_Characterization_of_Dynamic_Surfaces.html">226 cvpr-2013-Intrinsic Characterization of Dynamic Surfaces</a></p>

Most existing brain mapping methods are based on angle preserving maps, which may introduce large area distortions. This work proposes an area preserving brain mapping method based on MongeBrenier theory. The brain mapping is intrinsic to the Riemannian metric, unique, and diffeomorphic. The computation is equivalent to convex energy minimization and power Voronoi diagram construction. Comparing to the existing approaches based on Monge-Kantorovich theory, the proposed one greatly reduces the complexity (from n2 unknowns to n ), and improves the simplicity and efficiency. Experimental results on caudate nucleus surface mapping and cortical surface mapping demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method. Conventional methods for caudate nucleus surface mapping may suffer from numerical instability; in contrast, current method produces diffeomorpic mappings stably.

<p>Author: Zsolt Sánta, Zoltan Kato</p><p>Abstract: A novel correspondence-less approach is proposed to find a thin plate spline map between a pair of deformable 3D objects represented by triangular surface meshes. The proposed method works without landmark extraction and feature correspondences. The aligning transformation is found simply by solving a system of nonlinear equations. Each equation is generated by integrating a nonlinear function over the object’s domains. We derive recursive formulas for the efficient computation of these integrals. Based on a series of comparative tests on a large synthetic dataset, our triangular mesh-based algorithm outperforms state of the art methods both in terms of computing time and accuracy. The applicability of the proposed approach has been demonstrated on the registration of 3D lung CT volumes.</p><p>4 0.74554807 <a title="44-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution_Shape_Analysis_via_Non-Euclidean_Wavelets%3A_Applications_to_Mesh_Segmentation_and_Surface_Alignment_Problems.html">297 cvpr-2013-Multi-resolution Shape Analysis via Non-Euclidean Wavelets: Applications to Mesh Segmentation and Surface Alignment Problems</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhigang Ma, Yi Yang, Zhongwen Xu, Shuicheng Yan, Nicu Sebe, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Complex events essentially include human, scenes, objects and actions that can be summarized by visual attributes, so leveraging relevant attributes properly could be helpful for event detection. Many works have exploited attributes at image level for various applications. However, attributes at image level are possibly insufficient for complex event detection in videos due to their limited capability in characterizing the dynamic properties of video data. Hence, we propose to leverage attributes at video level (named as video attributes in this work), i.e., the semantic labels of external videos are used as attributes. Compared to complex event videos, these external videos contain simple contents such as objects, scenes and actions which are the basic elements of complex events. Specifically, building upon a correlation vector which correlates the attributes and the complex event, we incorporate video attributes latently as extra informative cues into the event detector learnt from complex event videos. Extensive experiments on a real-world large-scale dataset validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p><p>3 0.77499628 <a title="44-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic_Harmonic_Mapping_for_Constrained_Brain_Surface_Registration.html">208 cvpr-2013-Hyperbolic Harmonic Mapping for Constrained Brain Surface Registration</a></p>

<p>Author: Siddhartha Chandra, Shailesh Kumar, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: Understanding the nature of data is the key to building good representations. In domains such as natural images, the data comes from very complex distributions which are hard to capture. Feature learning intends to discover or best approximate these underlying distributions and use their knowledge to weed out irrelevant information, preserving most of the relevant information. Feature learning can thus be seen as a form of dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we describe a feature learning scheme for natural images. We hypothesize that image patches do not all come from the same distribution, they lie in multiple nonlinear subspaces. We propose a framework that uses K Restricted Boltzmann Machines (K-RBMS) to learn multiple non-linear subspaces in the raw image space. Projections of the image patches into these subspaces gives us features, which we use to build image representations. Our algorithm solves the coupled problem of finding the right non-linear subspaces in the input space and associating image patches with those subspaces in an iterative EM like algorithm to minimize the overall reconstruction error. Extensive empirical results over several popular image classification datasets show that representations based on our framework outperform the traditional feature representations such as the SIFT based Bag-of-Words (BoW) and convolutional deep belief networks.</p><p>5 0.76651633 <a title="44-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Brain_Effective_Connectivity_Analysis_for_Alzheimer%27s_Disease%3A_A_Kernel_Learning_Approach_upon_Sparse_Gaussian_Bayesian_Network.html">129 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Brain Effective Connectivity Analysis for Alzheimer's Disease: A Kernel Learning Approach upon Sparse Gaussian Bayesian Network</a></p>

The proposed method is tested on analyzing brain effective connectivity for AD from ADNI data, and demonstrates significant improvements over the state-of-the-art work.</p><p>6 0.76143122 <a title="44-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Modeling_Mutual_Visibility_Relationship_in_Pedestrian_Detection.html">288 cvpr-2013-Modeling Mutual Visibility Relationship in Pedestrian Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Neill D.F. Campbell, Kartic Subr, Jan Kautz</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are used for diverse tasks, ranging from image denoising to object recognition. For images, they are commonly defined as a graph with nodes corresponding to individual pixels and pairwise links that connect nodes to their immediate neighbors. Recent work has shown that fully-connected CRFs, where each node is connected to every other node, can be solved efficiently under the restriction that the pairwise term is a Gaussian kernel over a Euclidean feature space. In this paper, we generalize the pairwise terms to a non-linear dissimilarity measure that is not required to be a distance metric. To this end, we propose a density estimation technique to derive conditional pairwise potentials in a nonparametric manner. We then use an efficient embedding technique to estimate an approximate Euclidean feature space for these potentials, in which the pairwise term can still be expressed as a Gaussian kernel. We demonstrate that the use of non-parametric models for the pairwise interactions, conditioned on the input data, greatly increases expressive power whilst maintaining efficient inference.</p><p>3 0.1014601 <a title="128-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Deformable_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Fast_Dense_Correspondences.html">107 cvpr-2013-Deformable Spatial Pyramid Matching for Fast Dense Correspondences</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaechul Kim, Ce Liu, Fei Sha, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a fast deformable spatial pyramid (DSP) matching algorithm for computing dense pixel correspondences. Dense matching methods typically enforce both appearance agreement between matched pixels as well as geometric smoothness between neighboring pixels. Whereas the prevailing approaches operate at the pixel level, we propose a pyramid graph model that simultaneously regularizes match consistency at multiple spatial extents—ranging from an entire image, to coarse grid cells, to every single pixel. This novel regularization substantially improves pixel-level matching in the face of challenging image variations, while the “deformable ” aspect of our model overcomes the strict rigidity of traditional spatial pyramids. Results on LabelMe and Caltech show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods (SIFT Flow [15] and PatchMatch [2]), both in terms of accuracy and run time.</p><p>4 0.10004777 <a title="128-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Principled_Deep_Random_Field_Model_for_Image_Segmentation.html">24 cvpr-2013-A Principled Deep Random Field Model for Image Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Pushmeet Kohli, Anton Osokin, Stefanie Jegelka</p><p>Abstract: We discuss a model for image segmentation that is able to overcome the short-boundary bias observed in standard pairwise random field based approaches. To wit, we show that a random field with multi-layered hidden units can encode boundary preserving higher order potentials such as the ones used in the cooperative cuts model of [11] while still allowing for fast and exact MAP inference. Exact inference allows our model to outperform previous image segmentation methods, and to see the true effect of coupling graph edges. Finally, our model can be easily extended to handle segmentation instances with multiple labels, for which it yields promising results.</p><p>5 0.099811934 <a title="128-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Whitened_Expectation_Propagation%3A_Non-Lambertian_Shape_from_Shading_and_Shadow.html">466 cvpr-2013-Whitened Expectation Propagation: Non-Lambertian Shape from Shading and Shadow</a></p>
<p>Author: Brian Potetz, Mohammadreza Hajiarbabi</p><p>Abstract: For problems over continuous random variables, MRFs with large cliques pose a challenge in probabilistic inference. Difficulties in performing optimization efficiently have limited the probabilistic models explored in computer vision and other fields. One inference technique that handles large cliques well is Expectation Propagation. EP offers run times independent of clique size, which instead depend only on the rank, or intrinsic dimensionality, of potentials. This property would be highly advantageous in computer vision. Unfortunately, for grid-shaped models common in vision, traditional Gaussian EP requires quadratic space and cubic time in the number of pixels. Here, we propose a variation of EP that exploits regularities in natural scene statistics to achieve run times that are linear in both number of pixels and clique size. We test these methods on shape from shading, and we demonstrate strong performance not only for Lambertian surfaces, but also on arbitrary surface reflectance and lighting arrangements, which requires highly non-Gaussian potentials. Finally, we use large, non-local cliques to exploit cast shadow, which is traditionally ignored in shape from shading.</p><p>6 0.090332344 <a title="128-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Continuous_Inference_in_Graphical_Models_with_Polynomial_Energies.html">95 cvpr-2013-Continuous Inference in Graphical Models with Polynomial Energies</a></p>

<p>Author: Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of performing inference in graphical models whose energy is a polynomial function of continuous variables. Our energy minimization method follows a dual decomposition approach, where the global problem is split into subproblems defined over the graph cliques. The optimal solution to these subproblems is obtained by making use of a polynomial system solver. Our algorithm inherits the convergence guarantees of dual decomposition. To speed up optimization, we also introduce a variant of this algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian method. Our experiments illustrate the diversity of computer vision problems that can be expressed with polynomial energies, and demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing continuous inference methods.</p><p>3 0.75955111 <a title="128-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Universality_of_the_Local_Marginal_Polytope.html">448 cvpr-2013-Universality of the Local Marginal Polytope</a></p>
<p>Author: unkown-author</p><p>Abstract: We show that solving the LP relaxation of the MAP inference problem in graphical models (also known as the minsum problem, energy minimization, or weighted constraint satisfaction) is not easier than solving any LP.

<p>Author: Jörg Hendrik Kappes, Markus Speth, Gerhard Reinelt, Christoph Schnörr</p><p>Abstract: Discrete graphical models (also known as discrete Markov random fields) are a major conceptual tool to model the structure of optimization problems in computer vision. While in the last decade research has focused on fast approximative methods, algorithms that provide globally optimal solutions have come more into the research focus in the last years. However, large scale computer vision problems seemed to be out of reach for such methods. In this paper we introduce a promising way to bridge this gap based on partial optimality and structural properties of the underlying problem factorization. Combining these preprocessing steps, we are able to solve grids of size 2048 2048 in less than 90 seconds. On the hitherto unsolva2b04le8 C×h2i0ne4s8e character dataset of Nowozin et al. we obtain provably optimal results in 56% of the instances and achieve competitive runtimes on other recent benchmark problems. While in the present work only generalized Potts models are considered, an extension to general graphical models seems to be feasible.</p><p>5 0.74305445 <a title="128-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Principled_Deep_Random_Field_Model_for_Image_Segmentation.html">24 cvpr-2013-A Principled Deep Random Field Model for Image Segmentation</a></p>

By intentionally using such a non-uniform discretization, a higher balance between computational efficiency and accuracy of marginal density estimates could be achieved. We present a method for actually doing this, which dynamically discretizes the variable space in a coarse-to-fine manner in the course of the computation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>3 0.75933427 <a title="128-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Shape_from_Silhouette_Probability_Maps%3A_Reconstruction_of_Thin_Objects_in_the_Presence_of_Silhouette_Extraction_and_Calibration_Error.html">395 cvpr-2013-Shape from Silhouette Probability Maps: Reconstruction of Thin Objects in the Presence of Silhouette Extraction and Calibration Error</a></p>
<p>Author: Amy Tabb</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of reconstructing the shape ofthin, texture-less objects such as leafless trees when there is noise or deterministic error in the silhouette extraction step or there are small errors in camera calibration. Traditional intersection-based techniques such as the visual hull are not robust to error because they penalize false negative and false positive error unequally. We provide a voxel-based formalism that penalizes false negative and positive error equally, by casting the reconstruction problem as a pseudo-Boolean minimization problem, where voxels are the variables of a pseudo-Boolean function and are labeled occupied or empty. Since the pseudo-Boolean minimization problem is NP-Hard for nonsubmodular functions, we developed an algorithm for an approximate solution using local minimum search. Our algorithm treats input binary probability maps (in other words, silhouettes) or continuously-valued probability maps identically, and places no constraints on camera placement. The algorithm was tested on three different leafless trees and one metal object where the number of voxels is 54.4 million (voxel sides measure 3.6 mm). Results show that our . usda .gov (a)Orignalimage(b)SilhoueteProbabiltyMap approach reconstructs the complicated branching structure of thin, texture-less objects in the presence of error where intersection-based approaches currently fail. 1</p><p>4 0.75443625 <a title="128-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-BRDF_Slices%3A_Accurate_Adaptive_Anisotropic_Appearance_Acquisition.html">54 cvpr-2013-BRDF Slices: Accurate Adaptive Anisotropic Appearance Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Jirí Filip, Radomír Vávra, Michal Haindl, Pavel Žid, Mikuláš Krupika, Vlastimil Havran</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce unique publicly available dense anisotropic BRDF data measurements. We use this dense data as a reference for performance evaluation of the proposed BRDF sparse angular sampling and interpolation approach. The method is based on sampling of BRDF subspaces at fixed elevations by means of several adaptively-represented, uniformly distributed, perpendicular slices. Although this proposed method requires only a sparse sampling of material, the interpolation provides a very accurate reconstruction, visually and computationally comparable to densely measured reference. Due to the simple slices measurement and method’s robustness it allows for a highly accurate acquisition of BRDFs. This in comparison with standard uniform angular sampling, is considerably faster yet uses far less samples.</p><p>5 0.69752598 <a title="128-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-The_SVM-Minus_Similarity_Score_for_Video_Face_Recognition.html">430 cvpr-2013-The SVM-Minus Similarity Score for Video Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Lior Wolf, Noga Levy</p><p>Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained videos requires specialized tools beyond those developed for still images: the fact that the confounding factors change state during the video sequence presents a unique challenge, but also an opportunity to eliminate spurious similarities. Luckily, a major source of confusion in visual similarity of faces is the 3D head orientation, for which image analysis tools provide an accurate estimation. The method we propose belongs to a family of classifierbased similarity scores. We present an effective way to discount pose induced similarities within such a framework, which is based on a newly introduced classifier called SVMminus. The presented method is shown to outperform existing techniques on the most challenging and realistic publicly available video face recognition benchmark, both by itself, and in concert with other methods.</p><p>6 0.65748703 <a title="128-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Sub-categorization.html">134 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Sub-categorization</a></p>

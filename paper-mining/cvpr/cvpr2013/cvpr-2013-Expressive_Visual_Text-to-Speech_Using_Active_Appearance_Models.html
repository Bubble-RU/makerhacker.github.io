<p>Author: Yue Wu, Zuoguan Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: Facial feature tracking is an active area in computer vision due to its relevance to many applications. It is a nontrivial task, sincefaces may have varyingfacial expressions, poses or occlusions. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a face shape prior model that is constructed based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and their variants. Specifically, we first construct a model based on Deep Belief Networks to capture the face shape variations due to varying facial expressions for near-frontal view. To handle pose variations, the frontal face shape prior model is incorporated into a 3-way RBM model that could capture the relationship between frontal face shapes and non-frontal face shapes. Finally, we introduce methods to systematically combine the face shape prior models with image measurements of facial feature points. Experiments on benchmark databases show that with the proposed method, facial feature points can be tracked robustly and accurately even if faces have significant facial expressions and poses.</p><p>3 0.15462404 <a title="159-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-MKPLS%3A_Manifold_Kernel_Partial_Least_Squares_for_Lipreading_and_Speaker_Identification.html">276 cvpr-2013-MKPLS: Manifold Kernel Partial Least Squares for Lipreading and Speaker Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Amr Bakry, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a challenging problem, due to confusion between visual speech features. The speaker identification problem is usually coupled with speech recognition. Moreover, speaker identification is important to several applications, such as automatic access control, biometrics, authentication, and personal privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for lipreading and speaker identification. Wepropose a new approachfor manifold parameterization in a low-dimensional latent space, where each manifold is represented as a point in that space. We initially parameterize each instance manifold using a nonlinear mapping from a unified manifold representation. We then factorize the parameter space using Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) to achieve a low-dimension manifold latent space. We use two-way projections to achieve two manifold latent spaces, one for the speech content and one for the speaker. We apply our approach on two public databases: AVLetters and OuluVS. We show the results for three different settings of lipreading: speaker independent, speaker dependent, and speaker semi-dependent. Our approach outperforms for the speaker semi-dependent setting by at least 15% of the baseline, and competes in the other two settings.</p><p>4 0.12585495 <a title="159-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Discriminative_Response_Map_Fitting_with_Constrained_Local_Models.html">359 cvpr-2013-Robust Discriminative Response Map Fitting with Constrained Local Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Akshay Asthana, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Shiyang Cheng, Maja Pantic</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel discriminative regression based approach for the Constrained Local Models (CLMs) framework, referred to as the Discriminative Response Map Fitting (DRMF) method, which shows impressive performance in the generic face fitting scenario. The motivation behind this approach is that, unlike the holistic texture based features used in the discriminative AAM approaches, the response map can be represented by a small set of parameters and these parameters can be very efficiently used for reconstructing unseen response maps. Furthermore, we show that by adopting very simple off-the-shelf regression techniques, it is possible to learn robust functions from response maps to the shape parameters updates. The experiments, conducted on Multi-PIE, XM2VTS and LFPW database, show that the proposed DRMF method outperforms stateof-the-art algorithms for the task of generic face fitting. Moreover, the DRMF method is computationally very efficient and is real-time capable. The current MATLAB implementation takes 1second per image. To facilitate future comparisons, we release the MATLAB code1 and the pretrained models for research purposes.</p><p>5 0.10901283 <a title="159-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Supervised_Descent_Method_and_Its_Applications_to_Face_Alignment.html">420 cvpr-2013-Supervised Descent Method and Its Applications to Face Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Xuehan Xiong, Fernando De_la_Torre</p><p>Abstract: Many computer vision problems (e.g., camera calibration, image alignment, structure from motion) are solved through a nonlinear optimization method. It is generally accepted that 2nd order descent methods are the most robust, fast and reliable approaches for nonlinear optimization ofa general smoothfunction. However, in the context of computer vision, 2nd order descent methods have two main drawbacks: (1) The function might not be analytically differentiable and numerical approximations are impractical. (2) The Hessian might be large and not positive definite. To address these issues, thispaperproposes a Supervised Descent Method (SDM) for minimizing a Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) function. During training, the SDM learns a sequence of descent directions that minimizes the mean of NLS functions sampled at different points. In testing, SDM minimizes the NLS objective using the learned descent directions without computing the Jacobian nor the Hessian. We illustrate the benefits of our approach in synthetic and real examples, and show how SDM achieves state-ofthe-art performance in the problem of facial feature detec- tion.

<p>Author: Dong Yi, Zhen Lei, Stan Z. Li</p><p>Abstract: Most existing pose robust methods are too computational complex to meet practical applications and their performance under unconstrained environments are rarely evaluated. In this paper, we propose a novel method for pose robust face recognition towards practical applications, which is fast, pose robust and can work well under unconstrained environments. Firstly, a 3D deformable model is built and a fast 3D model fitting algorithm is proposed to estimate the pose of face image. Secondly, a group of Gabor filters are transformed according to the pose and shape of face image for feature extraction. Finally, PCA is applied on the pose adaptive Gabor features to remove the redundances and Cosine metric is used to evaluate the similarity. The proposed method has three advantages: (1) The pose correction is applied in the filter space rather than image space, which makes our method less affected by the precision of the 3D model; (2) By combining the holistic pose transformation and local Gabor filtering, the final feature is robust to pose and other negative factors in face recognition; (3) The 3D structure and facial symmetry are successfully used to deal with self-occlusion. Extensive experiments on FERET and PIE show the proposed method outperforms state-ofthe-art methods significantly, meanwhile, the method works well on LFW.</p><p>4 0.67673784 <a title="159-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Capturing_Complex_Spatio-temporal_Relations_among_Facial_Muscles_for_Facial_Expression_Recognition.html">77 cvpr-2013-Capturing Complex Spatio-temporal Relations among Facial Muscles for Facial Expression Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziheng Wang, Shangfei Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: Spatial-temporal relations among facial muscles carry crucial information about facial expressions yet have not been thoroughly exploited. One contributing factor for this is the limited ability of the current dynamic models in capturing complex spatial and temporal relations. Existing dynamic models can only capture simple local temporal relations among sequential events, or lack the ability for incorporating uncertainties. To overcome these limitations and take full advantage of the spatio-temporal information, we propose to model the facial expression as a complex activity that consists of temporally overlapping or sequential primitive facial events. We further propose the Interval Temporal Bayesian Network to capture these complex temporal relations among primitive facial events for facial expression modeling and recognition. Experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach in recognizing facial expressions based purely on spatio-temporal relations among facial muscles, as well as its advantage over the existing methods.</p><p>5 0.65845954 <a title="159-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Single-Sample_Face_Recognition_with_Image_Corruption_and_Misalignment_via_Sparse_Illumination_Transfer.html">399 cvpr-2013-Single-Sample Face Recognition with Image Corruption and Misalignment via Sparse Illumination Transfer</a></p>
<p>Author: Liansheng Zhuang, Allen Y. Yang, Zihan Zhou, S. Shankar Sastry, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Single-sample face recognition is one of the most challenging problems in face recognition. We propose a novel face recognition algorithm to address this problem based on a sparse representation based classification (SRC) framework. The new algorithm is robust to image misalignment and pixel corruption, and is able to reduce required training images to one sample per class. To compensate the missing illumination information typically provided by multiple training images, a sparse illumination transfer (SIT) technique is introduced. The SIT algorithms seek additional illumination examples of face images from one or more additional subject classes, and form an illumination dictionary. By enforcing a sparse representation of the query image, the method can recover and transfer the pose and illumination information from the alignment stage to the recognition stage. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that the new algorithms significantly outperform the existing algorithms in the single-sample regime and with less restrictions. In particular, the face alignment accuracy is comparable to that of the well-known Deformable SRC algorithm using multiple training images; and the face recognition accuracy exceeds those ofthe SRC andExtended SRC algorithms using hand labeled alignment initialization.</p><p>6 0.64958215 <a title="159-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-3D_Visual_Proxemics%3A_Recognizing_Human_Interactions_in_3D_from_a_Single_Image.html">4 cvpr-2013-3D Visual Proxemics: Recognizing Human Interactions in 3D from a Single Image</a></p>

<p>Author: Stefan Harmeling, Michael Hirsch, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We establish a link between Fourier optics and a recent construction from the machine learning community termed the kernel mean map. Using the Fraunhofer approximation, it identifies the kernel with the squared Fourier transform of the aperture. This allows us to use results about the invertibility of the kernel mean map to provide a statement about the invertibility of Fraunhofer diffraction, showing that imaging processes with arbitrarily small apertures can in principle be invertible, i.e., do not lose information, provided the objects to be imaged satisfy a generic condition. A real world experiment shows that we can super-resolve beyond the Rayleigh limit.</p><p>3 0.62470472 <a title="159-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Graph-Laplacian_PCA%3A_Closed-Form_Solution_and_Robustness.html">191 cvpr-2013-Graph-Laplacian PCA: Closed-Form Solution and Robustness</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Jiang, Chris Ding, Bio Luo, Jin Tang</p><p>Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used to learn a low-dimensional representation. In many applications, both vector data X and graph data W are available. Laplacian embedding is widely used for embedding graph data. Wepropose a graph-Laplacian PCA (gLPCA) to learn a low dimensional representation of X that incorporates graph structures encoded in W. This model has several advantages: (1) It is a data representation model. (2) It has a compact closed-form solution and can be efficiently computed. (3) It is capable to remove corruptions. Extensive experiments on 8 datasets show promising results on image reconstruction and significant improvement on clustering and classification.</p><p>4 0.61393958 <a title="159-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Incorporating_User_Interaction_and_Topological_Constraints_within_Contour_Completion_via_Discrete_Calculus.html">222 cvpr-2013-Incorporating User Interaction and Topological Constraints within Contour Completion via Discrete Calculus</a></p>
<p>Author: Jia Xu, Maxwell D. Collins, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of interactive segmentation and contour completion for multiple objects. The form of constraints our model incorporates are those coming from user scribbles (interior or exterior constraints) as well as information regarding the topology of the 2-D space after partitioning (number of closed contours desired). We discuss how concepts from discrete calculus and a simple identity using the Euler characteristic of a planar graph can be utilized to derive a practical algorithm for this problem. We also present specialized branch and bound methods for the case of single contour completion under such constraints. On an extensive dataset of ∼ 1000 images, our experimOenn tasn suggest vthea dt a assmetal ol fa m∼ou 1n0t0 of ismidaeg knowledge can give strong improvements over fully unsupervised contour completion methods.

<p>Author: Wufeng Xue, Lei Zhang, Xuanqin Mou</p><p>Abstract: General purpose blind image quality assessment (BIQA) has been recently attracting significant attention in thefields of image processing, vision and machine learning. Stateof-the-art BIQA methods usually learn to evaluate the image quality by regression from human subjective scores of the training samples. However, these methods need a large number of human scored images for training, and lack an explicit explanation of how the image quality is affected by image local features. An interesting question is then: can we learn for effective BIQA without using human scored images? This paper makes a good effort to answer this question. We partition the distorted images into overlapped patches, and use a percentile pooling strategy to estimate the local quality of each patch. Then a quality-aware clustering (QAC) method is proposed to learn a set of centroids on each quality level. These centroids are then used as a codebook to infer the quality of each patch in a given image, and subsequently a perceptual quality score of the whole image can be obtained. The proposed QAC based BIQA method is simple yet effective. It not only has comparable accuracy to those methods using human scored images in learning, but also has merits such as high linearity to human perception of image quality, real-time implementation and availability of image local quality map.</p><p>6 0.52671069 <a title="159-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Video_Editing_with_Temporal%2C_Spatial_and_Appearance_Consistency.html">453 cvpr-2013-Video Editing with Temporal, Spatial and Appearance Consistency</a></p>

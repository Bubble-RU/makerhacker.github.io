While much progress has been made in recent years with efforts on sharing code and datasets, it is of great importance to develop a library and benchmark to gauge the state of the art.

<p>Author: Lu Zhang, Laurens van_der_Maaten</p><p>Abstract: Model-free trackers can track arbitrary objects based on a single (bounding-box) annotation of the object. Whilst the performance of model-free trackers has recently improved significantly, simultaneously tracking multiple objects with similar appearance remains very hard. In this paper, we propose a new multi-object model-free tracker (based on tracking-by-detection) that resolves this problem by incorporating spatial constraints between the objects. The spatial constraints are learned along with the object detectors using an online structured SVM algorithm. The experimental evaluation ofour structure-preserving object tracker (SPOT) reveals significant performance improvements in multi-object tracking. We also show that SPOT can improve the performance of single-object trackers by simultaneously tracking different parts of the object.</p><p>4 0.26000789 <a title="365-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Tracking_Sports_Players_with_Context-Conditioned_Motion_Models.html">441 cvpr-2013-Tracking Sports Players with Context-Conditioned Motion Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jingchen Liu, Peter Carr, Robert T. Collins, Yanxi Liu</p><p>Abstract: We employ hierarchical data association to track players in team sports. Player movements are often complex and highly correlated with both nearby and distant players. A single model would require many degrees of freedom to represent the full motion diversity and could be difficult to use in practice. Instead, we introduce a set of Game Context Features extracted from noisy detections to describe the current state of the match, such as how the players are spatially distributed. Our assumption is that players react to the current situation in only a finite number of ways. As a result, we are able to select an appropriate simplified affinity model for each player and time instant using a random decisionforest based on current track and game contextfeatures. Our context-conditioned motion models implicitly incorporate complex inter-object correlations while remaining tractable. We demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing multi-target tracking algorithms on basketball and field hockey sequences several minutes in duration and containing 10 and 20 players respectively.</p><p>5 0.2576417 <a title="365-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Harry_Potter%27s_Marauder%27s_Map%3A_Localizing_and_Tracking_Multiple_Persons-of-Interest_by_Nonnegative_Discretization.html">199 cvpr-2013-Harry Potter's Marauder's Map: Localizing and Tracking Multiple Persons-of-Interest by Nonnegative Discretization</a></p>
<p>Author: Shoou-I Yu, Yi Yang, Alexander Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: A device just like Harry Potter’s Marauder’s Map, which pinpoints the location ofeachperson-of-interest at all times, provides invaluable information for analysis of surveillance videos. To make this device real, a system would be required to perform robust person localization and tracking in real world surveillance scenarios, especially for complex indoor environments with many walls causing occlusion and long corridors with sparse surveillance camera coverage. We propose a tracking-by-detection approach with nonnegative discretization to tackle this problem. Given a set of person detection outputs, our framework takes advantage of all important cues such as color, person detection, face recognition and non-background information to perform tracking. Local learning approaches are used to uncover the manifold structure in the appearance space with spatio-temporal constraints. Nonnegative discretization is used to enforce the mutual exclusion constraint, which guarantees a person detection output to only belong to exactly one individual. Experiments show that our algorithm performs robust lo- calization and tracking of persons-of-interest not only in outdoor scenes, but also in a complex indoor real-world nursing home environment.</p><p>6 0.24432875 <a title="365-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Self-Paced_Learning_for_Long-Term_Tracking.html">386 cvpr-2013-Self-Paced Learning for Long-Term Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Hofmann, Daniel Wolf, Gerhard Rigoll</p><p>Abstract: We generalize the network flow formulation for multiobject tracking to multi-camera setups. In the past, reconstruction of multi-camera data was done as a separate extension. In this work, we present a combined maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation, which jointly models multicamera reconstruction as well as global temporal data association. A flow graph is constructed, which tracks objects in 3D world space. The multi-camera reconstruction can be efficiently incorporated as additional constraints on the flow graph without making the graph unnecessarily large. The final graph is efficiently solved using binary linear programming. On the PETS 2009 dataset we achieve results that significantly exceed the current state of the art.</p><p>3 0.80978101 <a title="365-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Visual_Tracking_via_Locality_Sensitive_Histograms.html">457 cvpr-2013-Visual Tracking via Locality Sensitive Histograms</a></p>
<p>Author: Shengfeng He, Qingxiong Yang, Rynson W.H. Lau, Jiang Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel locality sensitive histogram algorithm for visual tracking. Unlike the conventional image histogram that counts the frequency of occurrences of each intensity value by adding ones to the corresponding bin, a locality sensitive histogram is computed at each pixel location and a floating-point value is added to the corresponding bin for each occurrence of an intensity value. The floating-point value declines exponentially with respect to the distance to the pixel location where the histogram is computed; thus every pixel is considered but those that are far away can be neglected due to the very small weights assigned. An efficient algorithm is proposed that enables the locality sensitive histograms to be computed in time linear in the image size and the number of bins. A robust tracking framework based on the locality sensitive histograms is proposed, which consists of two main components: a new feature for tracking that is robust to illumination changes and a novel multi-region tracking algorithm that runs in realtime even with hundreds of regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed tracking framework outper- , forms the state-of-the-art methods in challenging scenarios, especially when the illumination changes dramatically.</p><p>4 0.80920178 <a title="365-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Harry_Potter%27s_Marauder%27s_Map%3A_Localizing_and_Tracking_Multiple_Persons-of-Interest_by_Nonnegative_Discretization.html">199 cvpr-2013-Harry Potter's Marauder's Map: Localizing and Tracking Multiple Persons-of-Interest by Nonnegative Discretization</a></p>

We propose a generalized and mathematically sound L0 sparse expression, together with a new effective method, for motion deblurring. Our system does not require extra filtering during optimization and demonstrates fast energy decreasing, making a small number of iterations enough for convergence. It also provides a unifiedframeworkfor both uniform andnon-uniform motion deblurring.

<p>Author: Bo Wang, Zhuowen Tu</p><p>Abstract: With the increasing availability of high dimensional data and demand in sophisticated data analysis algorithms, manifold learning becomes a critical technique to perform dimensionality reduction, unraveling the intrinsic data structure. The real-world data however often come with noises and outliers; seldom, all the data live in a single linear subspace. Inspired by the recent advances in sparse subspace learning and diffusion-based approaches, we propose a new manifold denoising algorithm in which data neighborhoods are adaptively inferred via sparse subspace reconstruction; we then derive a new formulation to perform denoising to the original data. Experiments carried out on both toy and real applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method; it is insensitive to parameter tuning and we show significant improvement over the competing algorithms.</p><p>4 0.7168681 <a title="365-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Handling_Noise_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_Using_Directional_Filters.html">198 cvpr-2013-Handling Noise in Single Image Deblurring Using Directional Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Lin Zhong, Sunghyun Cho, Dimitris Metaxas, Sylvain Paris, Jue Wang</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art single image deblurring techniques are sensitive to image noise. Even a small amount of noise, which is inevitable in low-light conditions, can degrade the quality of blur kernel estimation dramatically. The recent approach of Tai and Lin [17] tries to iteratively denoise and deblur a blurry and noisy image. However, as we show in this work, directly applying image denoising methods often partially damages the blur information that is extracted from the input image, leading to biased kernel estimation. We propose a new method for handling noise in blind image deconvolution based on new theoretical and practical insights. Our key observation is that applying a directional low-pass filter to the input image greatly reduces the noise level, while preserving the blur information in the orthogonal direction to the filter. Based on this observation, our method applies a series of directional filters at different orientations to the input image, and estimates an accurate Radon transform of the blur kernel from each filtered image. Finally, we reconstruct the blur kernel using inverse Radon transform. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our algorithm achieves higher quality results than previous approaches on blurry and noisy images. 1</p><p>5 0.71648413 <a title="365-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_to_Estimate_and_Remove_Non-uniform_Image_Blur.html">265 cvpr-2013-Learning to Estimate and Remove Non-uniform Image Blur</a></p>
<p>Author: Florent Couzinié-Devy, Jian Sun, Karteek Alahari, Jean Ponce</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of restoring images subjected to unknown and spatially varying blur caused by defocus or linear (say, horizontal) motion. The estimation of the global (non-uniform) image blur is cast as a multilabel energy minimization problem. The energy is the sum of unary terms corresponding to learned local blur estimators, and binary ones corresponding to blur smoothness. Its global minimum is found using Ishikawa ’s method by exploiting the natural order of discretized blur values for linear motions and defocus. Once the blur has been estimated, the image is restored using a robust (non-uniform) deblurring algorithm based on sparse regularization with global image statistics. The proposed algorithm outputs both a segmentation of the image into uniform-blur layers and an estimate of the corresponding sharp image. We present qualitative results on real images, and use synthetic data to quantitatively compare our approach to the publicly available implementation of Chakrabarti et al. [5].</p><p>6 0.71296555 <a title="365-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_3D_Reconstruction_from_Severely_Blurred_Images_Using_a_Single_Moving_Camera.html">108 cvpr-2013-Dense 3D Reconstruction from Severely Blurred Images Using a Single Moving Camera</a></p>

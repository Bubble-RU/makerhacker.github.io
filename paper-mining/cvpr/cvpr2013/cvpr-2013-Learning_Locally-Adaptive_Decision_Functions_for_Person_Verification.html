<p>Author: Rui Zhao, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Human eyes can recognize person identities based on some small salient regions. However, such valuable salient information is often hidden when computing similarities of images with existing approaches. Moreover, many existing approaches learn discriminative features and handle drastic viewpoint change in a supervised way and require labeling new training data for a different pair of camera views. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective for person re-identification based on unsupervised salience learning. Distinctive features are extracted without requiring identity labels in the training procedure. First, we apply adjacency constrained patch matching to build dense correspondence between image pairs, which shows effectiveness in handling misalignment caused by large viewpoint and pose variations. Second, we learn human salience in an unsupervised manner. To improve the performance of person re-identification, human salience is incorporated in patch matching to find reliable and discriminative matched patches. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on the widely used VIPeR dataset and ETHZ dataset.</p><p>3 0.15197146 <a title="252-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Locally_Aligned_Feature_Transforms_across_Views.html">271 cvpr-2013-Locally Aligned Feature Transforms across Views</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Li, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach for matching images observed in different camera views with complex cross-view transforms and apply it to person reidentification.

The visual features of an image pair from different views are first locally aligned by being projected to a common feature space and then matched with softly assigned metrics which are locally optimized.

<p>Author: Shoou-I Yu, Yi Yang, Alexander Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: A device just like Harry Potter’s Marauder’s Map, which pinpoints the location ofeachperson-of-interest at all times, provides invaluable information for analysis of surveillance videos. To make this device real, a system would be required to perform robust person localization and tracking in real world surveillance scenarios, especially for complex indoor environments with many walls causing occlusion and long corridors with sparse surveillance camera coverage. We propose a tracking-by-detection approach with nonnegative discretization to tackle this problem. Given a set of person detection outputs, our framework takes advantage of all important cues such as color, person detection, face recognition and non-background information to perform tracking. Local learning approaches are used to uncover the manifold structure in the appearance space with spatio-temporal constraints. Nonnegative discretization is used to enforce the mutual exclusion constraint, which guarantees a person detection output to only belong to exactly one individual. Experiments show that our algorithm performs robust lo- calization and tracking of persons-of-interest not only in outdoor scenes, but also in a complex indoor real-world nursing home environment.</p><p>5 0.12556878 <a title="252-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Local_Fisher_Discriminant_Analysis_for_Pedestrian_Re-identification.html">270 cvpr-2013-Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis for Pedestrian Re-identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Sateesh Pedagadi, James Orwell, Sergio Velastin, Boghos Boghossian</p><p>Abstract: Metric learning methods, , forperson re-identification, estimate a scaling for distances in a vector space that is optimized for picking out observations of the same individual. This paper presents a novel approach to the pedestrian re-identification problem that uses metric learning to improve the state-of-the-art performance on standard public datasets. Very high dimensional features are extracted from the source color image. A first processing stage performs unsupervised PCA dimensionality reduction, constrained to maintain the redundancy in color-space representation. A second stage further reduces the dimensionality, using a Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis defined by a training set. A regularization step is introduced to avoid singular matrices during this stage. The experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets confirm that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance, including all other known metric learning methods. Furthermore, the method is an effective way to process observations comprising multiple shots, and is non-iterative: the computation times are relatively modest. Finally, a novel statistic is derived to characterize the Match Characteris- tic: the normalized entropy reduction can be used to define the ’Proportion of Uncertainty Removed’ (PUR). This measure is invariant to test set size and provides an intuitive indication of performance.</p><p>6 0.10818233 <a title="252-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Elastic_Matching_for_Pose_Variant_Face_Verification.html">338 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Elastic Matching for Pose Variant Face Verification</a></p>

<p>Author: Vignesh Ramanathan, Bangpeng Yao, Li Fei-Fei</p><p>Abstract: We deal with the problem of recognizing social roles played by people in an event. Social roles are governed by human interactions, and form a fundamental component of human event description. We focus on a weakly supervised setting, where we are provided different videos belonging to an event class, without training role labels. Since social roles are described by the interaction between people in an event, we propose a Conditional Random Field to model the inter-role interactions, along with person specific social descriptors. We develop tractable variational inference to simultaneously infer model weights, as well as role assignment to all people in the videos. We also present a novel YouTube social roles dataset with ground truth role annotations, and introduce annotations on a subset of videos from the TRECVID-MED11 [1] event kits for evaluation purposes. The performance of the model is compared against different baseline methods on these datasets.</p><p>3 0.66400719 <a title="252-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-3D_Visual_Proxemics%3A_Recognizing_Human_Interactions_in_3D_from_a_Single_Image.html">4 cvpr-2013-3D Visual Proxemics: Recognizing Human Interactions in 3D from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Ishani Chakraborty, Hui Cheng, Omar Javed</p><p>Abstract: We present a unified framework for detecting and classifying people interactions in unconstrained user generated images. 1 Unlike previous approaches that directly map people/face locations in 2D image space into features for classification, we first estimate camera viewpoint and people positions in 3D space and then extract spatial configuration features from explicit 3D people positions. This approach has several advantages. First, it can accurately estimate relative distances and orientations between people in 3D. Second, it encodes spatial arrangements of people into a richer set of shape descriptors than afforded in 2D. Our 3D shape descriptors are invariant to camera pose variations often seen in web images and videos. The proposed approach also estimates camera pose and uses it to capture the intent of the photo. To achieve accurate 3D people layout estimation, we develop an algorithm that robustly fuses semantic constraints about human interpositions into a linear camera model. This enables our model to handle large variations in people size, heights (e.g. age) and poses. An accurate 3D layout also allows us to construct features informed by Proxemics that improves our semantic classification. To characterize the human interaction space, we introduce visual proxemes; a set of prototypical patterns that represent commonly occurring social interactions in events. We train a discriminative classifier that classifies 3D arrangements of people into visual proxemes and quantitatively evaluate the performance on a large, challenging dataset.</p><p>4 0.66059864 <a title="252-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Locally_Aligned_Feature_Transforms_across_Views.html">271 cvpr-2013-Locally Aligned Feature Transforms across Views</a></p>

First Names as Facial Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Huizhong Chen, Andrew C. Gallagher, Bernd Girod</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new idea in describing people using their first names, i.e., the name assigned at birth. We show that describing people in terms of similarity to a vector of possible first names is a powerful description of facial appearance that can be used for face naming and building facial attribute classifiers. We build models for 100 common first names used in the United States and for each pair, construct a pairwise firstname classifier. These classifiers are built using training images downloaded from the internet, with no additional user interaction. This gives our approach important advantages in building practical systems that do not require additional human intervention for labeling. We use the scores from each pairwise name classifier as a set of facial attributes. We show several surprising results. Our name attributes predict the correct first names of test faces at rates far greater than chance. The name attributes are applied to gender recognition and to age classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with all training images automatically gathered from the internet.</p><p>6 0.56247687 <a title="252-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Local_Fisher_Discriminant_Analysis_for_Pedestrian_Re-identification.html">270 cvpr-2013-Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis for Pedestrian Re-identification</a></p>

This paper proposes to learn a decision function for verification that can be viewed as a joint model of a distance metric and a locally adaptive thresholding rule. We further formulate the inference on our decision function as a second-order large-margin regularization problem, and provide an efficient algorithm in its dual from. We evaluate our algorithm on both human body verification and face verification problems. Our method outperforms not only the classical metric learning algorithm including LMNN and ITML, but also the state-of-the-art in the computer vision community.</p><p>2 0.73032403 <a title="252-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Towards_Pose_Robust_Face_Recognition.html">438 cvpr-2013-Towards Pose Robust Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Dong Yi, Zhen Lei, Stan Z. Li</p><p>Abstract: Most existing pose robust methods are too computational complex to meet practical applications and their performance under unconstrained environments are rarely evaluated. In this paper, we propose a novel method for pose robust face recognition towards practical applications, which is fast, pose robust and can work well under unconstrained environments. Firstly, a 3D deformable model is built and a fast 3D model fitting algorithm is proposed to estimate the pose of face image. Secondly, a group of Gabor filters are transformed according to the pose and shape of face image for feature extraction. Finally, PCA is applied on the pose adaptive Gabor features to remove the redundances and Cosine metric is used to evaluate the similarity. The proposed method has three advantages: (1) The pose correction is applied in the filter space rather than image space, which makes our method less affected by the precision of the 3D model; (2) By combining the holistic pose transformation and local Gabor filtering, the final feature is robust to pose and other negative factors in face recognition; (3) The 3D structure and facial symmetry are successfully used to deal with self-occlusion. Extensive experiments on FERET and PIE show the proposed method outperforms state-ofthe-art methods significantly, meanwhile, the method works well on LFW.</p><p>3 0.71827114 <a title="252-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Multi-resolution_Pedestrian_Detection_in_Traffic_Scenes.html">363 cvpr-2013-Robust Multi-resolution Pedestrian Detection in Traffic Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Junjie Yan, Xucong Zhang, Zhen Lei, Shengcai Liao, Stan Z. Li</p><p>Abstract: The serious performance decline with decreasing resolution is the major bottleneck for current pedestrian detection techniques [14, 23]. In this paper, we take pedestrian detection in different resolutions as different but related problems, and propose a Multi-Task model to jointly consider their commonness and differences. The model contains resolution aware transformations to map pedestrians in different resolutions to a common space, where a shared detector is constructed to distinguish pedestrians from background. For model learning, we present a coordinate descent procedure to learn the resolution aware transformations and deformable part model (DPM) based detector iteratively. In traffic scenes, there are many false positives located around vehicles, therefore, we further build a context model to suppress them according to the pedestrian-vehicle relationship. The context model can be learned automatically even when the vehicle annotations are not available. Our method reduces the mean miss rate to 60% for pedestrians taller than 30 pixels on the Caltech Pedestrian Benchmark, which noticeably outperforms previous state-of-the-art (71%).</p><p>4 0.69089496 <a title="252-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Composite_Statistical_Inference_for_Semantic_Segmentation.html">86 cvpr-2013-Composite Statistical Inference for Semantic Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Fuxin Li, Joao Carreira, Guy Lebanon, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an inference procedure for the semantic segmentation of images. Differentfrom many CRF approaches that rely on dependencies modeled with unary and pairwise pixel or superpixel potentials, our method is entirely based on estimates of the overlap between each of a set of mid-level object segmentation proposals and the objects present in the image. We define continuous latent variables on superpixels obtained by multiple intersections of segments, then output the optimal segments from the inferred superpixel statistics. The algorithm is capable of recombine and refine initial mid-level proposals, as well as handle multiple interacting objects, even from the same class, all in a consistent joint inference framework by maximizing the composite likelihood of the underlying statistical model using an EM algorithm. In the PASCAL VOC segmentation challenge, the proposed approach obtains high accuracy and successfully handles images of complex object interactions.</p><p>5 0.68837678 <a title="252-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Optimized_Pedestrian_Detection_for_Multiple_and_Occluded_People.html">318 cvpr-2013-Optimized Pedestrian Detection for Multiple and Occluded People</a></p>
<p>Author: Sitapa Rujikietgumjorn, Robert T. Collins</p><p>Abstract: We present a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) framework for reasoning about multiple object detections with spatial overlaps. The method maximizes an objective function composed of unary detection confidence scores andpairwise overlap constraints to determine which overlapping detections should be suppressed, and which should be kept. The framework is flexible enough to handle the problem of detecting objects as a shape covering of a foreground mask, and to handle the problem of filtering confidence weighted detections produced by a traditional sliding window object detector. In our experiments, we show that our method outperforms two existing state-ofthe-art pedestrian detectors.</p><p>6 0.68769252 <a title="252-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Relative_Volume_Constraints_for_Single_View_3D_Reconstruction.html">354 cvpr-2013-Relative Volume Constraints for Single View 3D Reconstruction</a></p>

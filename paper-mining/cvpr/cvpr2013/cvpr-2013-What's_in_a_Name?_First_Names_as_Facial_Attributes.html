<p>Author: Amir Sadovnik, Andrew Gallagher, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: Visual attributes are powerful features for many different applications in computer vision such as object detection and scene recognition. Visual attributes present another application that has not been examined as rigorously: verbal communication from a computer to a human. Since many attributes are nameable, the computer is able to communicate these concepts through language. However, this is not a trivial task. Given a set of attributes, selecting a subset to be communicated is task dependent. Moreover, because attribute classifiers are noisy, it is important to find ways to deal with this uncertainty. We address the issue of communication by examining the task of composing an automatic description of a person in a group photo that distinguishes him from the others. We introduce an efficient, principled methodfor choosing which attributes are included in a short description to maximize the likelihood that a third party will correctly guess to which person the description refers. We compare our algorithm to computer baselines and human describers, and show the strength of our method in creating effective descriptions.</p><p>3 0.21552417 <a title="463-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Cumulative_Attribute_Space_for_Age_and_Crowd_Density_Estimation.html">101 cvpr-2013-Cumulative Attribute Space for Age and Crowd Density Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Chen, Shaogang Gong, Tao Xiang, Chen Change Loy</p><p>Abstract: A number of computer vision problems such as human age estimation, crowd density estimation and body/face pose (view angle) estimation can be formulated as a regression problem by learning a mapping function between a high dimensional vector-formed feature input and a scalarvalued output. Such a learning problem is made difficult due to sparse and imbalanced training data and large feature variations caused by both uncertain viewing conditions and intrinsic ambiguities between observable visual features and the scalar values to be estimated. Encouraged by the recent success in using attributes for solving classification problems with sparse training data, this paper introduces a novel cumulative attribute concept for learning a regression model when only sparse and imbalanced data are available. More precisely, low-level visual features extracted from sparse and imbalanced image samples are mapped onto a cumulative attribute space where each dimension has clearly defined semantic interpretation (a label) that captures how the scalar output value (e.g. age, people count) changes continuously and cumulatively. Extensive experiments show that our cumulative attribute framework gains notable advantage on accuracy for both age estimation and crowd counting when compared against conventional regression models, especially when the labelled training data is sparse with imbalanced sampling.</p><p>4 0.16355881 <a title="463-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_and_Aligning_Faces_by_Image_Retrieval.html">119 cvpr-2013-Detecting and Aligning Faces by Image Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohui Shen, Zhe Lin, Jonathan Brandt, Ying Wu</p><p>Abstract: Detecting faces in uncontrolled environments continues to be a challenge to traditional face detection methods[24] due to the large variation in facial appearances, as well as occlusion and clutter. In order to overcome these challenges, we present a novel and robust exemplarbased face detector that integrates image retrieval and discriminative learning. A large database of faces with bounding rectangles and facial landmark locations is collected, and simple discriminative classifiers are learned from each of them. A voting-based method is then proposed to let these classifiers cast votes on the test image through an efficient image retrieval technique. As a result, faces can be very efficiently detected by selecting the modes from the voting maps, without resorting to exhaustive sliding window-style scanning. Moreover, due to the exemplar-based framework, our approach can detect faces under challenging conditions without explicitly modeling their variations. Evaluation on two public benchmark datasets shows that our new face detection approach is accurate and efficient, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. We further propose to use image retrieval for face validation (in order to remove false positives) and for face alignment/landmark localization. The same methodology can also be easily generalized to other facerelated tasks, such as attribute recognition, as well as general object detection.</p><p>5 0.15468089 <a title="463-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Constrained_Clustering_and_Its_Application_to_Face_Clustering_in_Videos.html">92 cvpr-2013-Constrained Clustering and Its Application to Face Clustering in Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Baoyuan Wu, Yifan Zhang, Bao-Gang Hu, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on face clustering in videos. Given the detected faces from real-world videos, we partition all faces into K disjoint clusters. Different from clustering on a collection of facial images, the faces from videos are organized as face tracks and the frame index of each face is also provided. As a result, many pairwise constraints between faces can be easily obtained from the temporal and spatial knowledge of the face tracks. These constraints can be effectively incorporated into a generative clustering model based on the Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRFs). Within the HMRF model, the pairwise constraints are augmented by label-level and constraint-level local smoothness to guide the clustering process. The parameters for both the unary and the pairwise potential functions are learned by the simulated field algorithm, and the weights of constraints can be easily adjusted. We further introduce an efficient clustering framework specially for face clustering in videos, considering that faces in adjacent frames of the same face track are very similar. The framework is applicable to other clustering algorithms to significantly reduce the computational cost. Experiments on two face data sets from real-world videos demonstrate the significantly improved performance of our algorithm over state-of-theart algorithms.</p><p>6 0.1532425 <a title="463-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Facial_Feature_Tracking_Under_Varying_Facial_Expressions_and_Face_Poses_Based_on_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines.html">161 cvpr-2013-Facial Feature Tracking Under Varying Facial Expressions and Face Poses Based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Ishani Chakraborty, Hui Cheng, Omar Javed</p><p>Abstract: We present a unified framework for detecting and classifying people interactions in unconstrained user generated images. 1 Unlike previous approaches that directly map people/face locations in 2D image space into features for classification, we first estimate camera viewpoint and people positions in 3D space and then extract spatial configuration features from explicit 3D people positions. This approach has several advantages. First, it can accurately estimate relative distances and orientations between people in 3D. Second, it encodes spatial arrangements of people into a richer set of shape descriptors than afforded in 2D. Our 3D shape descriptors are invariant to camera pose variations often seen in web images and videos. The proposed approach also estimates camera pose and uses it to capture the intent of the photo. To achieve accurate 3D people layout estimation, we develop an algorithm that robustly fuses semantic constraints about human interpositions into a linear camera model. This enables our model to handle large variations in people size, heights (e.g. age) and poses. An accurate 3D layout also allows us to construct features informed by Proxemics that improves our semantic classification. To characterize the human interaction space, we introduce visual proxemes; a set of prototypical patterns that represent commonly occurring social interactions in events. We train a discriminative classifier that classifies 3D arrangements of people into visual proxemes and quantitatively evaluate the performance on a large, challenging dataset.</p><p>5 0.69002795 <a title="463-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-POOF%3A_Part-Based_One-vs.-One_Features_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization%2C_Face_Verification%2C_and_Attribute_Estimation.html">323 cvpr-2013-POOF: Part-Based One-vs.-One Features for Fine-Grained Categorization, Face Verification, and Attribute Estimation</a></p>

Belhumeur</p><p>Abstract: From a set ofimages in aparticular domain, labeled with part locations and class, we present a method to automatically learn a large and diverse set of highly discriminative intermediate features that we call Part-based One-vs-One Features (POOFs). Each of these features specializes in discrimination between two particular classes based on the appearance at a particular part. We demonstrate the particular usefulness of these features for fine-grained visual categorization with new state-of-the-art results on bird species identification using the Caltech UCSD Birds (CUB) dataset and parity with the best existing results in face verification on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. Finally, we demonstrate the particular advantage of POOFs when training data is scarce.</p><p>6 0.67678982 <a title="463-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Probabilistic_Elastic_Matching_for_Pose_Variant_Face_Verification.html">338 cvpr-2013-Probabilistic Elastic Matching for Pose Variant Face Verification</a></p>

<p>Author: Huizhong Chen, Andrew C. Gallagher, Bernd Girod</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new idea in describing people using their first names, i.e., the name assigned at birth. We show that describing people in terms of similarity to a vector of possible first names is a powerful description of facial appearance that can be used for face naming and building facial attribute classifiers. We build models for 100 common first names used in the United States and for each pair, construct a pairwise firstname classifier. These classifiers are built using training images downloaded from the internet, with no additional user interaction. This gives our approach important advantages in building practical systems that do not require additional human intervention for labeling. We use the scores from each pairwise name classifier as a set of facial attributes. We show several surprising results. Our name attributes predict the correct first names of test faces at rates far greater than chance. The name attributes are applied to gender recognition and to age classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with all training images automatically gathered from the internet.</p><p>2 0.68789029 <a title="463-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Incorporating_Structural_Alternatives_and_Sharing_into_Hierarchy_for_Multiclass_Object_Recognition_and_Detection.html">221 cvpr-2013-Incorporating Structural Alternatives and Sharing into Hierarchy for Multiclass Object Recognition and Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaolong Wang, Liang Lin, Lichao Huang, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a reconfigurable model to recognize and detect multiclass (or multiview) objects with large variation in appearance. Compared with well acknowledged hierarchical models, we study two advanced capabilities in hierarchy for object modeling: (i) “switch” variables(i.e. or-nodes) for specifying alternative compositions, and (ii) making local classifiers (i.e. leaf-nodes) shared among different classes. These capabilities enable us to account well for structural variabilities while preserving the model compact. Our model, in the form of an And-Or Graph, comprises four layers: a batch of leaf-nodes with collaborative edges in bottom for localizing object parts; the or-nodes over bottom to activate their children leaf-nodes; the andnodes to classify objects as a whole; one root-node on the top for switching multiclass classification, which is also an or-node. For model training, we present an EM-type algorithm, namely dynamical structural optimization (DSO), to iteratively determine the structural configuration, (e.g., leaf-node generation associated with their parent or-nodes and shared across other classes), along with optimizing multi-layer parameters. The proposed method is valid on challenging databases, e.g., PASCAL VOC2007and UIUCPeople, and it achieves state-of-the-arts performance.</p><p>3 0.65905291 <a title="463-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Deep_Convolutional_Network_Cascade_for_Facial_Point_Detection.html">104 cvpr-2013-Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Sun, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for estimation of the positions of facial keypoints with three-level carefully designed convolutional networks. At each level, the outputs of multiple networks are fused for robust and accurate estimation. Thanks to the deep structures of convolutional networks, global high-level features are extracted over the whole face region at the initialization stage, which help to locate high accuracy keypoints. There are two folds of advantage for this. First, the texture context information over the entire face is utilized to locate each keypoint. Second, since the networks are trained to predict all the keypoints simultaneously, the geometric constraints among keypoints are implicitly encoded. The method therefore can avoid local minimum caused by ambiguity and data corruption in difficult image samples due to occlusions, large pose variations, and extreme lightings. The networks at the following two levels are trained to locally refine initial predictions and their inputs are limited to small regions around the initial predictions. Several network structures critical for accurate and robust facial point detection are investigated. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-ofthe-art methods in both detection accuracy and reliability1.</p><p>4 0.65764558 <a title="463-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Multi-target_Tracking_by_Rank-1_Tensor_Approximation.html">301 cvpr-2013-Multi-target Tracking by Rank-1 Tensor Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinchu Shi, Haibin Ling, Junling Xing, Weiming Hu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we formulate multi-target tracking (MTT) as a rank-1 tensor approximation problem and propose an ?1 norm tensor power iteration solution. In particular, a high order tensor is constructed based on trajectories in the time window, with each tensor element as the affinity of the corresponding trajectory candidate. The local assignment variables are the ?1 normalized vectors, which are used to approximate the rank-1 tensor. Our approach provides a flexible and effective formulation where both pairwise and high-order association energies can be used expediently. We also show the close relation between our formulation and the multi-dimensional assignment (MDA) model. To solve the optimization in the rank-1 tensor approximation, we propose an algorithm that iteratively powers the intermediate solution followed by an ?1 normalization. Aside from effectively capturing high-order motion information, the proposed solver runs efficiently with proved convergence. The experimental validations are conducted on two challenging datasets and our method demonstrates promising performances on both.</p><p>5 0.65729165 <a title="463-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-parametric_Filtering_for_Geometric_Detail_Extraction_and_Material_Representation.html">305 cvpr-2013-Non-parametric Filtering for Geometric Detail Extraction and Material Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zicheng Liao, Jason Rock, Yang Wang, David Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: Geometric detail is a universal phenomenon in real world objects. It is an important component in object modeling, but not accounted for in current intrinsic image works. In this work, we explore using a non-parametric method to separate geometric detail from intrinsic image components. We further decompose an image as albedo ∗ (ccoomarpsoen-escnatsle. shading +e shading pdoestaeil a).n Oaugre decomposition offers quantitative improvement in albedo recovery and material classification.Our method also enables interesting image editing activities, including bump removal, geometric detail smoothing/enhancement and material transfer.</p><p>6 0.65558815 <a title="463-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_New_Model_and_Simple_Algorithms_for_Multi-label_Mumford-Shah_Problems.html">20 cvpr-2013-A New Model and Simple Algorithms for Multi-label Mumford-Shah Problems</a></p>

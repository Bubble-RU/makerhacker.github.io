<p>Author: Haroon Idrees, Imran Saleemi, Cody Seibert, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: We propose to leverage multiple sources of information to compute an estimate of the number of individuals present in an extremely dense crowd visible in a single image. Due to problems including perspective, occlusion, clutter, and few pixels per person, counting by human detection in such images is almost impossible. Instead, our approach relies on multiple sources such as low confidence head detections, repetition of texture elements (using SIFT), and frequency-domain analysis to estimate counts, along with confidence associated with observing individuals, in an image region. Secondly, we employ a global consistency constraint on counts using Markov Random Field. This caters for disparity in counts in local neighborhoods and across scales. We tested our approach on a new dataset of fifty crowd images containing 64K annotated humans, with the head counts ranging from 94 to 4543. This is in stark con- trast to datasets usedfor existing methods which contain not more than tens of individuals. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed approach by quantifying the counting performance.</p><p>3 0.12256355 <a title="78-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Topical_Video_Object_Discovery_from_Key_Frames_by_Modeling_Word_Co-occurrence_Prior.html">434 cvpr-2013-Topical Video Object Discovery from Key Frames by Modeling Word Co-occurrence Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Gangqiang Zhao, Junsong Yuan, Gang Hua</p><p>Abstract: A topical video object refers to an object that is frequently highlighted in a video. It could be, e.g., the product logo and the leading actor/actress in a TV commercial. We propose a topic model that incorporates a word co-occurrence prior for efficient discovery of topical video objects from a set of key frames. Previous work using topic models, such as Latent Dirichelet Allocation (LDA), for video object discovery often takes a bag-of-visual-words representation, which ignored important co-occurrence information among the local features. We show that such data driven co-occurrence information from bottom-up can conveniently be incorporated in LDA with a Gaussian Markov prior, which combines top down probabilistic topic modeling with bottom up priors in a unified model. Our experiments on challenging videos demonstrate that the proposed approach can discover different types of topical objects despite variations in scale, view-point, color and lighting changes, or even partial occlusions. The efficacy of the co-occurrence prior is clearly demonstrated when comparing with topic models without such priors.</p><p>4 0.11453624 <a title="78-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Crossing_the_Line%3A_Crowd_Counting_by_Integer_Programming_with_Local_Features.html">100 cvpr-2013-Crossing the Line: Crowd Counting by Integer Programming with Local Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Zheng Ma, Antoni B. Chan</p><p>Abstract: We propose an integer programming method for estimating the instantaneous count of pedestrians crossing a line of interest in a video sequence. Through a line sampling process, the video is first converted into a temporal slice image. Next, the number of people is estimated in a set of overlapping sliding windows on the temporal slice image, using a regression function that maps from local features to a count. Given that count in a sliding window is the sum of the instantaneous counts in the corresponding time interval, an integer programming method is proposed to recover the number of pedestrians crossing the line of interest in each frame. Integrating over a specific time interval yields the cumulative count of pedestrian crossing the line. Compared with current methods for line counting, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging crowd video datasets.</p><p>5 0.092922881 <a title="78-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Understanding_Indoor_Scenes_Using_3D_Geometric_Phrases.html">446 cvpr-2013-Understanding Indoor Scenes Using 3D Geometric Phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Wongun Choi, Yu-Wei Chao, Caroline Pantofaru, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: Visual scene understanding is a difficult problem interleaving object detection, geometric reasoning and scene classification. We present a hierarchical scene model for learning and reasoning about complex indoor scenes which is computationally tractable, can be learned from a reasonable amount of training data, and avoids oversimplification. At the core of this approach is the 3D Geometric Phrase Model which captures the semantic and geometric relationships between objects whichfrequently co-occur in the same 3D spatial configuration. Experiments show that this model effectively explains scene semantics, geometry and object groupings from a single image, while also improving individual object detections.</p><p>6 0.089834675 <a title="78-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Part_Discovery_from_Partial_Correspondence.html">325 cvpr-2013-Part Discovery from Partial Correspondence</a></p>

<p>Author: Bolei Zhou, Xiaoou Tang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Collective motions are common in crowd systems and have attracted a great deal of attention in a variety of multidisciplinary fields. Collectiveness, which indicates the degree of individuals acting as a union in collective motion, is a fundamental and universal measurement for various crowd systems. By integrating path similarities among crowds on collective manifold, this paper proposes a descriptor of collectiveness and an efficient computation for the crowd and its constituent individuals. The algorithm of the Collective Merging is then proposed to detect collective motions from random motions. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed collectiveness descriptor on the system of self-driven particles. We then compare the collectiveness descriptor to human perception for collective motion and show high consistency. Our experiments regarding the detection of collective motions and the measurement of collectiveness in videos of pedestrian crowds and bacteria colony demonstrate a wide range of applications of the collectiveness descriptor1.</p><p>5 0.63123107 <a title="78-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Lp-Norm_IDF_for_Large_Scale_Image_Search.html">275 cvpr-2013-Lp-Norm IDF for Large Scale Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Liang Zheng, Shengjin Wang, Ziqiong Liu, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: The Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is prevalently utilized in the Bag-of-Words based image search. The basic idea is to assign less weight to terms with high frequency, and vice versa. However, the estimation of visual word frequency is coarse and heuristic. Therefore, the effectiveness of the conventional IDF routine is marginal, and far from optimal. To tackle thisproblem, thispaper introduces a novel IDF expression by the use of Lp-norm pooling technique. . edu . cn qit i @ c s an . ut s a . edu ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Carefully designed, the proposed IDF takes into account the term frequency, document frequency, the complexity of images, as well as the codebook information. Optimizing the IDF function towards optimal balancing between TF and pIDF weights yields the so-called Lp-norm IDF (pIDF).

Our method is evaluated through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (Oxford 5K, Paris 6K and Flickr 1M). We report a performance improvement of as large as 27.1% over the baseline approach. Moreover, since the Lp-norm IDF is computed offline, no extra computation or memory cost is introduced to the system at all.</p><p>6 0.61868858 <a title="78-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-GRASP_Recurring_Patterns_from_a_Single_View.html">183 cvpr-2013-GRASP Recurring Patterns from a Single View</a></p>

Being a bag of word model with spatial layout in the latent space, the CG model has superior handling of field of view changes in comparison to other bag of word models, but with the price of being essentially a mixture, mapping each scene to a single window in the grid. In this paper we introduce a family of componential models, dubbed the Componential Counting Grid, whose members represent each input image by multiple latent locations, rather than just one. In this way, we make a substantially more flexible admixture model which captures layers or parts of images and maps them to separate windows in a Counting Grid. We tested the models on scene and place classification where their com- ponential nature helped to extract objects, to capture parallax effects, thus better fitting the data and outperforming Counting Grids and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, especially on sequences taken with wearable cameras.</p><p>2 0.72642267 <a title="78-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Part-Based_Visual_Tracking_with_Online_Latent_Structural_Learning.html">324 cvpr-2013-Part-Based Visual Tracking with Online Latent Structural Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Yao, Qinfeng Shi, Chunhua Shen, Yanning Zhang, Anton van_den_Hengel</p><p>Abstract: Despite many advances made in the area, deformable targets and partial occlusions continue to represent key problems in visual tracking. Structured learning has shown good results when applied to tracking whole targets, but applying this approach to a part-based target model is complicated by the need to model the relationships between parts, and to avoid lengthy initialisation processes. We thus propose a method which models the unknown parts using latent variables. In doing so we extend the online algorithm pegasos to the structured prediction case (i.e., predicting the location of the bounding boxes) with latent part variables. To better estimate the parts, and to avoid over-fitting caused by the extra model complexity/capacity introduced by theparts, wepropose a two-stage trainingprocess, based on the primal rather than the dual form. We then show that the method outperforms the state-of-the-art (linear and non-linear kernel) trackers.</p><p>3 0.69984126 <a title="78-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Measuring_Crowd_Collectiveness.html">282 cvpr-2013-Measuring Crowd Collectiveness</a></p>
<p>Author: Bolei Zhou, Xiaoou Tang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Collective motions are common in crowd systems and have attracted a great deal of attention in a variety of multidisciplinary fields. Collectiveness, which indicates the degree of individuals acting as a union in collective motion, is a fundamental and universal measurement for various crowd systems. By integrating path similarities among crowds on collective manifold, this paper proposes a descriptor of collectiveness and an efficient computation for the crowd and its constituent individuals. The algorithm of the Collective Merging is then proposed to detect collective motions from random motions. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed collectiveness descriptor on the system of self-driven particles. We then compare the collectiveness descriptor to human perception for collective motion and show high consistency. Our experiments regarding the detection of collective motions and the measurement of collectiveness in videos of pedestrian crowds and bacteria colony demonstrate a wide range of applications of the collectiveness descriptor1.</p><p>4 0.69806987 <a title="78-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Real-Time_Model-Based_Rigid_Object_Pose_Estimation_and_Tracking_Combining_Dense_and_Sparse_Visual_Cues.html">345 cvpr-2013-Real-Time Model-Based Rigid Object Pose Estimation and Tracking Combining Dense and Sparse Visual Cues</a></p>
<p>Author: Karl Pauwels, Leonardo Rubio, Javier Díaz, Eduardo Ros</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel model-based method for estimating and tracking the six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) pose of rigid objects of arbitrary shapes in real-time. By combining dense motion and stereo cues with sparse keypoint correspondences, and by feeding back information from the model to the cue extraction level, the method is both highly accurate and robust to noise and occlusions. A tight integration of the graphical and computational capability of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) results in pose updates at framerates exceeding 60 Hz. Since a benchmark dataset that enables the evaluation of stereo-vision-based pose estimators in complex scenarios is currently missing in the literature, we have introduced a novel synthetic benchmark dataset with varying objects, background motion, noise and occlusions. Using this dataset and a novel evaluation methodology, we show that the proposed method greatly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we demonstrate excellent performance on challenging real-world sequences involving object manipulation.</p><p>5 0.69770432 <a title="78-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Higher-Order_CRF_Model_for_Road_Network_Extraction.html">13 cvpr-2013-A Higher-Order CRF Model for Road Network Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan D. Wegner, Javier A. Montoya-Zegarra, Konrad Schindler</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to extract the road network from aerial images. What makes the problem challenging is the complex structure of the prior: roads form a connected network of smooth, thin segments which meet at junctions and crossings. This type of a-priori knowledge is more difficult to turn into a tractable model than standard smoothness or co-occurrence assumptions. We develop a novel CRF formulation for road labeling, in which the prior is represented by higher-order cliques that connect sets of superpixels along straight line segments. These long-range cliques have asymmetric PN-potentials, which express a preference to assign all rather than just some of their constituent superpixels to the road class. Thus, the road likelihood is amplified for thin chains of superpixels, while the CRF is still amenable to optimization with graph cuts. Since the number of such cliques of arbitrary length is huge, we furthermorepropose a sampling scheme which concentrates on those cliques which are most relevant for the optimization. In experiments on two different databases the model significantly improves both the per-pixel accuracy and the topological correctness of the extracted roads, and outper- forms both a simple smoothness prior and heuristic rulebased road completion.</p><p>6 0.69674712 <a title="78-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Video_Editing_with_Temporal%2C_Spatial_and_Appearance_Consistency.html">453 cvpr-2013-Video Editing with Temporal, Spatial and Appearance Consistency</a></p>

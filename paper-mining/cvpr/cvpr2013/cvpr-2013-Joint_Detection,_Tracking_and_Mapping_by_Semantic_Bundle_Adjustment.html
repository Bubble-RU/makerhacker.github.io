<p>Author: Renato F. Salas-Moreno, Richard A. Newcombe, Hauke Strasdat, Paul H.J. Kelly, Andrew J. Davison</p><p>Abstract: We present the major advantages of a new ‘object oriented’ 3D SLAM paradigm, which takes full advantage in the loop of prior knowledge that many scenes consist of repeated, domain-specific objects and structures. As a hand-held depth camera browses a cluttered scene, realtime 3D object recognition and tracking provides 6DoF camera-object constraints which feed into an explicit graph of objects, continually refined by efficient pose-graph optimisation. This offers the descriptive and predictive power of SLAM systems which perform dense surface reconstruction, but with a huge representation compression. The object graph enables predictions for accurate ICP-based camera to model tracking at each live frame, and efficient active search for new objects in currently undescribed image regions. We demonstrate real-time incremental SLAM in large, cluttered environments, including loop closure, relocalisation and the detection of moved objects, and of course the generation of an object level scene description with the potential to enable interaction.</p><p>3 0.46688485 <a title="231-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_Reconstruction_Using_3D_Object_Shape_Priors.html">111 cvpr-2013-Dense Reconstruction Using 3D Object Shape Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Amaury Dame, Victor A. Prisacariu, Carl Y. Ren, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We propose a formulation of monocular SLAM which combines live dense reconstruction with shape priors-based 3D tracking and reconstruction. Current live dense SLAM approaches are limited to the reconstruction of visible surfaces. Moreover, most of them are based on the minimisation of a photo-consistency error, which usually makes them sensitive to specularities. In the 3D pose recovery literature, problems caused by imperfect and ambiguous image information have been dealt with by using prior shape knowledge. At the same time, the success of depth sensors has shown that combining joint image and depth information drastically increases the robustness of the classical monocular 3D tracking and 3D reconstruction approaches. In this work we link dense SLAM to 3D object pose and shape recovery. More specifically, we automatically augment our SLAMsystem with object specific identity, together with 6D pose and additional shape degrees of freedom for the object(s) of known class in the scene, combining im- age data and depth information for the pose and shape recovery. This leads to a system that allows for full scaled 3D reconstruction with the known object(s) segmented from the scene. The segmentation enhances the clarity, accuracy and completeness of the maps built by the dense SLAM system, while the dense 3D data aids the segmentation process, yieldingfaster and more reliable convergence than when using 2D image data alone.</p><p>4 0.1830955 <a title="231-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-CLAM%3A_Coupled_Localization_and_Mapping_with_Efficient_Outlier_Handling.html">74 cvpr-2013-CLAM: Coupled Localization and Mapping with Efficient Outlier Handling</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Balzer, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method to efficiently generate a model (map) of small-scale objects from video. The map encodes sparse geometry as well as coarse photometry, and could be used to initialize dense reconstruction schemes as well as to support recognition and localization of three-dimensional objects. Self-occlusions and the predominance of outliers present a challenge to existing online Structure From Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping systems. We propose a unified inference criterion that encompasses map building and localization (object detection) relative to the map in a coupled fashion. We establish correspondence in a computationally efficient way without resorting to combinatorial matching or random-sampling techniques. Instead, we use a simpler M-estimator that exploits putative correspondence from tracking after photometric and topological validation. We have collected a new dataset to benchmark model building in the small scale, which we test our algorithm on in comparison to others. Although our system is significantly leaner than previous ones, it compares favorably to the state of the art in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p><p>5 0.15079176 <a title="231-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Real-Time_Model-Based_Rigid_Object_Pose_Estimation_and_Tracking_Combining_Dense_and_Sparse_Visual_Cues.html">345 cvpr-2013-Real-Time Model-Based Rigid Object Pose Estimation and Tracking Combining Dense and Sparse Visual Cues</a></p>
<p>Author: Karl Pauwels, Leonardo Rubio, Javier Díaz, Eduardo Ros</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel model-based method for estimating and tracking the six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) pose of rigid objects of arbitrary shapes in real-time. By combining dense motion and stereo cues with sparse keypoint correspondences, and by feeding back information from the model to the cue extraction level, the method is both highly accurate and robust to noise and occlusions. A tight integration of the graphical and computational capability of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) results in pose updates at framerates exceeding 60 Hz. Since a benchmark dataset that enables the evaluation of stereo-vision-based pose estimators in complex scenarios is currently missing in the literature, we have introduced a novel synthetic benchmark dataset with varying objects, background motion, noise and occlusions. Using this dataset and a novel evaluation methodology, we show that the proposed method greatly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we demonstrate excellent performance on challenging real-world sequences involving object manipulation.</p><p>6 0.13942054 <a title="231-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Self-Paced_Learning_for_Long-Term_Tracking.html">386 cvpr-2013-Self-Paced Learning for Long-Term Tracking</a></p>

<p>Author: Luc Oth, Paul Furgale, Laurent Kneip, Roland Siegwart</p><p>Abstract: Rolling Shutter (RS) cameras are used across a wide range of consumer electronic devices—from smart-phones to high-end cameras. It is well known, that if a RS camera is used with a moving camera or scene, significant image distortions are introduced. The quality or even success of structure from motion on rolling shutter images requires the usual intrinsic parameters such as focal length and distortion coefficients as well as accurate modelling of the shutter timing. The current state-of-the-art technique for calibrating the shutter timings requires specialised hardware. We present a new method that only requires video of a known calibration pattern. Experimental results on over 60 real datasets show that our method is more accurate than the current state of the art.</p><p>6 0.50677669 <a title="231-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Efficient_2D-to-3D_Correspondence_Filtering_for_Scalable_3D_Object_Recognition.html">138 cvpr-2013-Efficient 2D-to-3D Correspondence Filtering for Scalable 3D Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Long Mai, Yuzhen Niu, Feng Liu</p><p>Abstract: A variety of methods have been developed for visual saliency analysis. These methods often complement each other. This paper addresses the problem of aggregating various saliency analysis methods such that the aggregation result outperforms each individual one. We have two major observations. First, different methods perform differently in saliency analysis. Second, the performance of a saliency analysis method varies with individual images. Our idea is to use data-driven approaches to saliency aggregation that appropriately consider the performance gaps among individual methods and the performance dependence of each method on individual images. This paper discusses various data-driven approaches and finds that the image-dependent aggregation method works best. Specifically, our method uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework for saliency aggregation that not only models the contribution from individual saliency map but also the interaction between neighboringpixels. To account for the dependence of aggregation on an individual image, our approach selects a subset of images similar to the input image from a training data set and trains the CRF aggregation model only using this subset instead of the whole training set. Our experiments on public saliency benchmarks show that our aggregation method outperforms each individual saliency method and is robust with the selection of aggregated methods.</p><p>2 0.92632937 <a title="231-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-CLAM%3A_Coupled_Localization_and_Mapping_with_Efficient_Outlier_Handling.html">74 cvpr-2013-CLAM: Coupled Localization and Mapping with Efficient Outlier Handling</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan Balzer, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method to efficiently generate a model (map) of small-scale objects from video. The map encodes sparse geometry as well as coarse photometry, and could be used to initialize dense reconstruction schemes as well as to support recognition and localization of three-dimensional objects. Self-occlusions and the predominance of outliers present a challenge to existing online Structure From Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping systems. We propose a unified inference criterion that encompasses map building and localization (object detection) relative to the map in a coupled fashion. We establish correspondence in a computationally efficient way without resorting to combinatorial matching or random-sampling techniques. Instead, we use a simpler M-estimator that exploits putative correspondence from tracking after photometric and topological validation. We have collected a new dataset to benchmark model building in the small scale, which we test our algorithm on in comparison to others. Although our system is significantly leaner than previous ones, it compares favorably to the state of the art in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p><p>3 0.91229665 <a title="231-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Practical_Rank-Constrained_Eight-Point_Algorithm_for_Fundamental_Matrix_Estimation.html">23 cvpr-2013-A Practical Rank-Constrained Eight-Point Algorithm for Fundamental Matrix Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yinqiang Zheng, Shigeki Sugimoto, Masatoshi Okutomi</p><p>Abstract: Due to its simplicity, the eight-point algorithm has been widely used in fundamental matrix estimation. Unfortunately, the rank-2 constraint of a fundamental matrix is enforced via a posterior rank correction step, thus leading to non-optimal solutions to the original problem. To address this drawback, existing algorithms need to solve either a very high order polynomial or a sequence of convex relaxation problems, both of which are computationally ineffective and numerically unstable. In this work, we present a new rank-2 constrained eight-point algorithm, which directly incorporates the rank-2 constraint in the minimization process. To avoid singularities, we propose to solve seven subproblems and retrieve their globally optimal solutions by using tailored polynomial system solvers. Our proposed method is noniterative, computationally efficient and numerically stable. Experiment results have verified its superiority over existing algebraic error based algorithms in terms of accuracy, as well as its advantages when used to initialize geometric error based algorithms.</p><p>4 0.89940733 <a title="231-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Principled_Deep_Random_Field_Model_for_Image_Segmentation.html">24 cvpr-2013-A Principled Deep Random Field Model for Image Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Pushmeet Kohli, Anton Osokin, Stefanie Jegelka</p><p>Abstract: We discuss a model for image segmentation that is able to overcome the short-boundary bias observed in standard pairwise random field based approaches. To wit, we show that a random field with multi-layered hidden units can encode boundary preserving higher order potentials such as the ones used in the cooperative cuts model of [11] while still allowing for fast and exact MAP inference. Exact inference allows our model to outperform previous image segmentation methods, and to see the true effect of coupling graph edges. Finally, our model can be easily extended to handle segmentation instances with multiple labels, for which it yields promising results.</p><p>5 0.88223338 <a title="231-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-FrameBreak%3A_Dramatic_Image_Extrapolation_by_Guided_Shift-Maps.html">177 cvpr-2013-FrameBreak: Dramatic Image Extrapolation by Guided Shift-Maps</a></p>
<p>Author: Yinda Zhang, Jianxiong Xiao, James Hays, Ping Tan</p><p>Abstract: We significantly extrapolate the field of view of a photograph by learning from a roughly aligned, wide-angle guide image of the same scene category. Our method can extrapolate typical photos into complete panoramas. The extrapolation problem is formulated in the shift-map image synthesis framework. We analyze the self-similarity of the guide image to generate a set of allowable local transformations and apply them to the input image. Our guided shift-map method preserves to the scene layout of the guide image when extrapolating a photograph. While conventional shiftmap methods only support translations, this is not expressive enough to characterize the self-similarity of complex scenes. Therefore we additionally allow image transformations of rotation, scaling and reflection. To handle this in- crease in complexity, we introduce a hierarchical graph optimization method to choose the optimal transformation at each output pixel. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of indoor, outdoor, natural, and man-made scenes.</p><p>6 0.86626112 <a title="231-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Deformable_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Fast_Dense_Correspondences.html">107 cvpr-2013-Deformable Spatial Pyramid Matching for Fast Dense Correspondences</a></p>
